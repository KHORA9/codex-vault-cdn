A nation\r\nwhich endures factious domestic division is exposed to disrespect\r\nabroad, and one party, if not both, is sure sooner or later to invoke\r\nforeign intervention.\r\n\r\nNations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the\r\ncounsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition, although\r\nmeasures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate\r\nand injurious to those adopting them.\r\n\r\nThe disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of\r\nour country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked\r\nabroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they\r\nprobably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have\r\nseemed to assume, that foreign nations in this case, discarding all\r\nmoral, social, and treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly\r\nfor the most speedy restoration of commerce, including especially the\r\nacquisition of cotton, those nations appear as yet not to have seen\r\ntheir way to their object more directly or clearly through the\r\ndestruction than through the preservation of the Union. If we could\r\ndare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher\r\nprinciple than this, I am quite sure a sound argument could be made to\r\nshow them that they can reach their aim more readily and easily by\r\naiding to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it.\r\n\r\nThe principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign\r\nnations to hostility against us, as already intimated, is the\r\nembarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably saw\r\nfrom the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign as\r\nour domestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive that\r\nthe effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty, and that one\r\nstrong nation promises more durable peace and a more extensive,\r\nvaluable, and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into\r\nhostile fragments.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states,\r\nbecause, whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integrity\r\nof our country and the stability of our Government mainly depend not\r\nupon them, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of\r\nthe American people. The correspondence itself, with the usual\r\nreservations, is herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nI venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and\r\nliberality toward foreign powers, averting causes of irritation and\r\nwith firmness maintaining our own rights and honor.\r\n\r\nSince, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other state,\r\nforeign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend\r\nthat adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public\r\ndefenses on every side. While under this general recommendation\r\nprovision for defending our seacoast line readily occurs to the mind, I\r\nalso in the same connection ask the attention of Congress to our great\r\nlakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots of\r\narms and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements, all at\r\nwell-selected points upon these, would be of great importance to the\r\nnational defense and preservation. I ask attention to the views of the\r\nSecretary of War, expressed in his report, upon the same general\r\nsubject. I deem it of importance that the loyal regions of east\r\nTennessee and western North Carolina should be connected with Kentucky\r\nand other faithful parts of the Union by railroad. I therefore\r\nrecommend, as a military measure, that Congress provide for the\r\nconstruction of such road as speedily as possible. Kentucky no doubt\r\nwill cooperate, and through her legislature make the most judicious\r\nselection of a line. The northern terminus must connect with some\r\nexisting railroad, and whether the route shall be from Lexington or\r\nNicholasville to the Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to the Tennessee\r\nline, in the direction of Knoxville, or on some still different line,\r\ncan easily be determined. Kentucky and the General Government\r\ncooperating, the work can be completed in a very short time, and when\r\ndone it will be not only of vast present usefulness, but also a\r\nvaluable permanent improvement, worth its cost in all the future.\r\n\r\nSome treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and\r\nhaving no grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate for their consideration.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to\r\nadopt a desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war, we have\r\nremoved all obstructions from the way of this humane reform except such\r\nas are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the correspondence between Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's minister accredited to this Government and the Secretary of\r\nState relative to the detention of the British ship Perthshire in June\r\nlast by the United States steamer Massachusetts for a supposed breach\r\nof the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious\r\nmisapprehension of the facts, and as justice requires that we should\r\ncommit no belligerent act not rounded in strict right as sanctioned by\r\npublic law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the\r\nreasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his annual message to\r\nCongress in December last in regard to the disposition of the surplus\r\nwhich will probably remain after satisfying the claims of American\r\ncitizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the commissioners\r\nunder the act of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, it should not be\r\ndeemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect, I would\r\nsuggest that authority be given for investing the principal, over the\r\nproceeds of the surplus referred to, in good securities, with a view to\r\nthe satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against\r\nChina as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our\r\nextensive trade with that Empire.\r\n\r\nBy the act of the 5th of August last Congress authorized the President\r\nto instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves\r\nagainst and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a\r\nsingle instance only. For the more effectual protection of our\r\nextensive and valuable commerce in the Eastern seas especially, it\r\nseems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders\r\nof sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make of\r\nUnited States vessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts now\r\nestablished by law in Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases in the\r\nevent that this should not be objected to by the local authorities.\r\n\r\nIf any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding\r\nour recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and\r\nLiberia, I am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a\r\nnovel policy in regard to them without the approbation of Congress, I\r\nsubmit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for\r\nmaintaining a charge d'affaires near each of those new States. It does\r\nnot admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be\r\nsecured by favorable treaties with them.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Treasury during the period which has elapsed\r\nsince your adjournment have been conducted with signal success. The\r\npatriotism of the people has placed at the disposal of the Government\r\nthe large means demanded by the public exigencies. Much of the national\r\nloan has been taken by citizens of the industrial classes, whose\r\nconfidence in their country's faith and zeal for their country's\r\ndeliverance from present peril have induced them to contribute to the\r\nsupport of the Government the whole of their limited acquisitions. This\r\nfact imposes peculiar obligations to economy in disbursement and energy\r\nin action.\r\n\r\nThe revenue from all sources, including loans, for the financial year\r\nending on the 30th of June, 1861, was $86,835,900.27, and the\r\nexpenditures for the same period, including payments on account of the\r\npublic debt, were $84,578,834.47, leaving a balance in the Treasury on\r\nthe 1st of July of 52,257,065.80. For the first quarter of the\r\nfinancial year ending on the 30th of September, 1861, the receipts from\r\nall sources, including the balance of the 1st of July, were\r\n$102,532,509.27, and the expenses $98,239,733.09, leaving a balance on\r\nthe 1st of October, 1861, of $4,292,776.18.\r\n\r\nEstimates for the remaining three quarters of the year and for the\r\nfinancial year 1863, together with his views of ways and means for\r\nmeeting the demands contemplated by them, will be submitted to Congress\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the\r\nexpenditures made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the\r\nresources of the loyal people, and to believe that the same patriotism\r\nwhich has thus far sustained the Government will continue to sustain it\r\ntill peace and union shall again bless the land.\r\n\r\nI respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War for\r\ninformation respecting the numerical strength of the Army and for\r\nrecommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and the\r\nwell-being of the various branches of the service intrusted to his\r\ncare. It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people has\r\nproved equal to the occasion, and that the number of troops tendered\r\ngreatly exceeds the force which Congress authorized me to call into the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nI refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make\r\nallusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our\r\ntroops and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire Army.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the Secretary for an organization of the militia\r\nupon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to the future\r\nsafety of the country, and is commended to the serious attention of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe large addition to the Regular Army, in connection with the\r\ndefection that has so considerably diminished the number of its\r\nofficers, gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for\r\nincreasing the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of the Military\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nBy mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to provide chaplains\r\nfor hospitals occupied by volunteers. This subject was brought to my\r\nnotice, and I was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of\r\nwhich, properly addressed, has been delivered to each of the persons,\r\nand at the dates respectively named and stated in a schedule,\r\ncontaining also the form of the letter marked A, and herewith\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties designated at\r\nthe times respectively stated in the schedule, and have labored\r\nfaithfully therein ever since. I therefore recommend that they be\r\ncompensated at the same rate as chaplains in the Army. I further\r\nsuggest that general provision be made for chaplains to serve at\r\nhospitals, as well as with regiments.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail the\r\noperations of that branch of the service, the activity and energy which\r\nhave characterized its administration, and the results of measures to\r\nincrease its efficiency and power. Such have been the additions, by\r\nconstruction and purchase, that it may almost be said a navy has been\r\ncreated and brought into service since our difficulties commenced.\r\n\r\nBesides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than ever\r\nbefore assembled under our flag have been put afloat and performed\r\ndeeds which have increased our naval renown.\r\n\r\nI would invite special attention to the recommendation of the Secretary\r\nfor a more perfect organization of the Navy by introducing additional\r\ngrades in the service.\r\n\r\nThe present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and the\r\nsuggestions submitted by the Department will, it is believed, if\r\nadopted, obviate the difficulties alluded to, promote harmony, and\r\nincrease the efficiency of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThere are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court--two by the\r\ndecease of Justices Daniel and McLean and one by the resignation of\r\nJustice Campbell. I have so far forborne making nominations to fill\r\nthese vacancies for reasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoing\r\njudges resided within the States now overrun by revolt, so that if\r\nsuccessors were appointed in the same localities they could not now\r\nserve upon their circuits; and many of the most competent men there\r\nprobably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve, even\r\nhere, upon the Supreme bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the\r\nappointments northward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to the\r\nSouth on the return of peace; although I may remark that to transfer to\r\nthe North one which has heretofore been in the South would not, with\r\nreference to territory and population, be unjust.\r\n\r\nDuring the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean his\r\ncircuit grew into an empire altogether too large for any one judge to\r\ngive the courts therein more than a nominal attendance--rising in\r\npopulation from 1,470,018 in 1830 to 6,151,405 in 1860.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the country generally has outgrown our present judicial\r\nsystem. If uniformity was at all intended, the system requires that all\r\nthe States shall be accommodated with circuit courts, attended by\r\nSupreme judges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas,\r\nFlorida, Texas, California, and Oregon have never had any such courts.\r\nNor can this well be remedied without a change in the system, because\r\nthe adding of judges to the Supreme Court, enough for the accommodation\r\nof all parts of the country with circuit courts, would create a court\r\naltogether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort. And the evil,\r\nif it be one, will increase as new States come into the Union. Circuit\r\ncourts are useful or they are not useful. If useful, no State should be\r\ndenied them; if not useful, no State should have them. Let them be\r\nprovided for all or abolished as to all.\r\n\r\nThree modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be an\r\nimprovement upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of\r\nconvenient number in every event; then, first, let the whole country be\r\ndivided into circuits of convenient size, the Supreme judges to serve\r\nin a number of them corresponding to their own number, and independent\r\ncircuit judges be provided for all the rest; or, secondly, let the\r\nSupreme judges be relieved from circuit duties and circuit judges\r\nprovided for all the circuits; or, thirdly, dispense with circuit\r\ncourts altogether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to the\r\ndistrict courts and an independent Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nI respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the present\r\ncondition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able\r\nto find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which\r\nconstantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of\r\nthem. Since the organization of the Government Congress has enacted\r\nsome 5,000 acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than 6,000\r\nclosely printed pages and are scattered through many volumes. Many of\r\nthese acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so\r\nthat their provisions are often obscure in themselves or in conflict\r\nwith each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult\r\nfor even the best-informed persons to ascertain precisely what the\r\nstatute law really is.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as\r\nplain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a\r\ncompass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of\r\nthe Legislature and the perspicuity of its language. This well done\r\nwould, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is\r\nto assist in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting\r\nbenefit to the people, by placing before them in a more accessible and\r\nintelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and\r\ntheir duties.\r\n\r\nI am informed by some whose opinions I respect that all the acts of\r\nCongress now in force and of a permanent and general nature might be\r\nrevised and rewritten so as to be embraced in one volume (or at most\r\ntwo volumes) of ordinary and convenient size; and I respectfully\r\nrecommend to Congress to consider of the subject, and if my suggestion\r\nbe approved to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most\r\nproper for the attainment of the end proposed.\r\n\r\nOne of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the\r\nentire suppression in many places of all the ordinary means of\r\nadministering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of\r\nexisting law. This is the case, in whole or in part, in all the\r\ninsurgent States; and as our armies advance upon and take possession of\r\nparts of those States the practical evil becomes more apparent. There\r\nare no courts nor officers to whom the citizens of other States may\r\napply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of\r\nthe insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting\r\nsuch claims. Some have estimated it as high as $200,000,000, due in\r\nlarge part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are\r\neven now making great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic\r\nduty to support the Government.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I have been urgently solicited to establish\r\nby military power courts to administer summary justice in such cases I\r\nhave thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the\r\nend proposed--the collection of the debts--was just and right in\r\nitself, but because I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of\r\nnecessity in the unusual exercise of power. But the powers of Congress,\r\nI suppose, are equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer\r\nthe whole matter to Congress, with the hope that a plan may be devised\r\nfor the administration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent\r\nStates and Territories as may be under the control of this Government,\r\nwhether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the power\r\nof our arms; this, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a\r\ntemporary substitute, and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can\r\nbe reestablished in peace.\r\n\r\nIt is important that some more convenient means should be provided, if\r\npossible, for the adjustment of claims against the Government,\r\nespecially in view of their increased number by reason of the war. It\r\nis as much the duty of Government to render prompt justice against\r\nitself in favor of citizens as it is to administer the same between\r\nprivate individuals. The investigation and adjudication of claims in\r\ntheir nature belong to the judicial department. Besides, it is apparent\r\nthat the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged for\r\nsome time to come with great national questions. It was intended by the\r\norganization of the Court of Claims mainly to remove this branch of\r\nbusiness from the halls of Congress: but while the court has proved to\r\nbe an effective and valuable means of investigation, it in great degree\r\nfails to effect the object of its creation for want of power to make\r\nits judgments final.\r\n\r\nFully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the subject, I\r\ncommend to your careful consideration whether this power of making\r\njudgments final may not properly be given to the court, reserving the\r\nright of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme Court, with such\r\nother provisions as experience may have shown to be necessary.\r\n\r\nI ask attention to the report of the Postmaster-General, the following\r\nbeing a summary statement of the condition of the Department:\r\n\r\nThe revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1861, including the annual permanent appropriation of $700,000 for the\r\ntransportation of \"free mail matter,\" was $9,049,296.40, being about 2\r\nper cent less than the revenue for 1860.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures were $13,606,759.11, showing a decrease of more than 8\r\nper cent as compared with those of the previous year and leaving an\r\nexcess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of\r\n$4,557,462.71.\r\n\r\nThe gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at an\r\nincrease of 4 per cent on that of 1861, making $8,683,000, to which\r\nshould be added the earnings of the Department in carrying free matter,\r\nviz, $700,000, making $9,383,000.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leaving\r\nan estimated deficiency of $3,145,000 to be supplied from the Treasury\r\nin addition to the permanent appropriation.\r\n\r\nThe present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this\r\nDistrict across the Potomac River at the time of establishing the\r\ncapital here was eminently wise, and consequently that the\r\nrelinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the State of\r\nVirginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit for your consideration the\r\nexpediency of regaining that part of the District and the restoration\r\nof the original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the State\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying\r\ndocuments, exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public\r\nbusiness pertaining to that Department. The depressing influences of\r\nthe insurrection have been specially felt in the operations of the\r\nPatent and General Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of\r\npublic lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of our\r\nland system only about $200,000. The sales have been entirely suspended\r\nin the Southern States, while the interruptions to the business of the\r\ncountry and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to\r\nmilitary service have obstructed settlements in the new States and\r\nTerritories of the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about\r\n$100,000, rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary\r\nto make it self-sustaining.\r\n\r\nThe demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by the\r\ninsurrection. Numerous applications for pensions, based upon the\r\ncasualties of the existing war, have already been made. There is reason\r\nto believe that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt\r\nof the bounty of the Government are in the ranks of the insurgent army\r\nor giving them aid and comfort. The Secretary of the Interior has\r\ndirected a suspension of the payment of the pensions of such persons\r\nupon proof of their disloyalty. I recommend that Congress authorize\r\nthat officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the\r\npension rolls.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the Government with the Indian tribes have been\r\ngreatly disturbed by the insurrection, especially in the southern\r\nsuperintendency and in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of\r\nKansas is in the possession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The\r\nagents of the United States appointed since the 4th of March for this\r\nsuperintendency have been unable to reach their posts, while the most\r\nof those who were in office before that time have espoused the\r\ninsurrectionary cause, and assume to exercise the powers of agents by\r\nvirtue of commissions from the insurrectionists. It has been stated in\r\nthe public press that a portion of those Indians have been organized as\r\na military force and are attached to the army of the insurgents.\r\nAlthough the Government has no official information upon this subject,\r\nletters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by\r\nseveral prominent chiefs giving assurance of their loyalty to the\r\nUnited States and expressing a wish for the presence of Federal troops\r\nto protect them. It is believed that upon the repossession of the\r\ncountry by the Federal forces the Indians will readily cease all\r\nhostile demonstrations and resume their former relations to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has not a\r\ndepartment nor a bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in the\r\nGovernment. While it is fortunate that this great interest is so\r\nindependent in its nature as to not have demanded and extorted more\r\nfrom the Government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether\r\nsomething more can not be given voluntarily with general advantage.\r\n\r\nAnnual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce,\r\nand manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical\r\nvalue to the country. While I make no suggestion as to details, I\r\nventure the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might\r\nprofitably be organized.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave\r\ntrade has been confided to the Department of the Interior. It is a\r\nsubject of gratulation that the efforts which have been made for the\r\nsuppression of this inhuman traffic have been recently attended with\r\nunusual success. Five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have\r\nbeen seized and condemned. Two mates of vessels engaged in the trade\r\nand one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver have been convicted\r\nand subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain,\r\ntaken with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been convicted\r\nof the highest grade of offense under our laws, the punishment of which\r\nis death.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, created by the last\r\nCongress, have been organized, and civil administration has been\r\ninaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when it is\r\nconsidered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of\r\nthese new countries when the Federal officers arrived there.\r\n\r\nThe abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security\r\nand protection afforded by organized government, will doubtless invite\r\nto them a large immigration when peace shall restore the business of\r\nthe country to its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the\r\nlegislature of Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the\r\npeople of the Territory. So far the authority of the United States has\r\nbeen upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in the\r\nfuture. I commend their interests and defense to the enlightened and\r\ngenerous care of Congress.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests of\r\nthe District of Columbia. The insurrection has been the cause of much\r\nsuffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no\r\nrepresentative in Congress that body should not overlook their just\r\nclaims upon the Government.\r\n\r\nAt your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the\r\nPresident to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of\r\nthe industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the\r\nindustry of all nations to be holden at London in the year 1862. I\r\nregret to say I have been unable to give personal attention to this\r\nsubject--a subject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively\r\nand intimately connected with the material prosperity of the world.\r\nThrough the Secretaries of State and of the Interior a plan or system\r\nhas been devised and partly matured, and which will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nUnder and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled \"An act to\r\nconfiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,\" approved August\r\n6, 1861, the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service\r\nof certain other persons have become forfeited, and numbers of the\r\nlatter thus liberated are already dependent on the United States and\r\nmust be provided for in some way. Besides this, it is not impossible\r\nthat some of the States will pass similar enactments for their own\r\nbenefit respectively, and by operation of which persons of the same\r\nclass will be thrown upon them for disposal. In such case I recommend\r\nthat Congress provide for accepting such persons from such States,\r\naccording to some mode of valuation, in lieu, pro tanto, of direct\r\ntaxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such States\r\nrespectively; that such persons, on such acceptance by the General\r\nGovernment, be at once deemed free, and that in any event steps be\r\ntaken for colonizing both classes (or the one first mentioned if the\r\nother shall not be brought into existence) at some place or places in a\r\nclimate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too, whether\r\nthe free colored people already in the United States could not, so far\r\nas individuals may desire, be included in such colonization.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of\r\nterritory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be\r\nexpended in the territorial acquisition. Having practiced the\r\nacquisition of territory for nearly sixty years, the question of\r\nconstitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us. The\r\npower was questioned at first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the\r\npurchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great\r\nexpediency. If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring\r\nterritory is to furnish homes for white men, this measure effects that\r\nobject, for the emigration of colored men leaves additional room for\r\nwhite men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the\r\nimportance of procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial\r\ngrounds than on providing room for population.\r\n\r\nOn this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money with\r\nthe acquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount to\r\nabsolute necessity--that without which the Government itself can not be\r\nperpetuated?\r\n\r\nThe war continues. In considering the policy to be adopted for\r\nsuppressing the insurrection I have been anxious and careful that the\r\ninevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a\r\nviolent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have therefore in\r\nevery case thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union\r\nprominent as the primary object of the contest on our pan, leaving all\r\nquestions which are not of vital military importance to the more\r\ndeliberate action of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of\r\nthe ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force by\r\nproclamation the law of Congress enacted .at the late session for\r\nclosing those ports.\r\n\r\nSo also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligations\r\nof law, instead of transcending I have adhered to the act of Congress\r\nto confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law\r\nupon the same subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly\r\nconsidered. The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable\r\nmeans must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine that\r\nradical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the\r\ndisloyal, are indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration and the\r\nmessage to Congress at the late special session were both mainly\r\ndevoted to the domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and\r\nconsequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract to or\r\nfrom the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in those\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nThe last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at the\r\nassault upon Fort Sumter, and a general review of what has occurred\r\nsince may not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain then is\r\nmuch better defined and more distinct now, and the progress of events\r\nis plainly in the right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a\r\nstrong support from north of Mason and Dixon's line, and the friends of\r\nthe Union were not free from apprehension on the point. This, however,\r\nwas soon settled definitely, and on the right side. South of the line\r\nnoble little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland was made\r\nto seem against the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were\r\nburned, and railroads torn up within her limits, and we were many days\r\nat one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over her\r\nsoil to the capital. Now her bridges and railroads are repaired and\r\nopen to the Government; she already gives seven regiments to the cause\r\nof the Union, and none to the enemy; and her people, at a regular\r\nelection, have sustained the Union by a larger majority and a larger\r\naggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate or any\r\nquestion. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly and,\r\nI think, unchangeably ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri is\r\ncomparatively quiet, and, I believe, can not again be overrun by the\r\ninsurrectionists. These three States of Maryland, Kentucky, and\r\nMissouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first,\r\nhave now an aggregate of not less than 40,000 in the field for the\r\nUnion, while of their citizens certainly not more than a third of that\r\nnumber, and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful existence, are in\r\narms against us. After a somewhat bloody struggle of months, winter\r\ncloses on the Union people of western Virginia, leaving them masters of\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\nAn insurgent force of about 1,500, for months dominating the narrow\r\npeninsular region constituting the counties of Accomac and Northampton,\r\nand known as Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous\r\nparts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people there have\r\nrenewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the old\r\nflag. This leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac or east\r\nof the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\nAlso we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the\r\nsouthern coast of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee Island (near Savannah),\r\nand Ship Island; and we likewise have some general accounts of popular\r\nmovements in behalf of the Union in North Carolina and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThese things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is advancing\r\nsteadily and certainly southward.\r\n\r\nSince your last adjournment Lieutenant-General Scott has retired from\r\nthe head of the Army. During his long life the nation has not been\r\nunmindful of his merit; yet on calling to mind how faithfully, ably,\r\nand brilliantly he has served the country, from a time far back in our\r\nhistory, when few of the now living had been born, and thenceforward\r\ncontinually, I can not but think we are still his debtors. I submit,\r\ntherefore, for your consideration what further mark of recognition is\r\ndue to him, and to ourselves as a grateful people.\r\n\r\nWith the retirement of General Scott came the Executive duty of\r\nappointing in his stead a General in Chief of the Army. It is a\r\nfortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country was there,\r\nso far as I know, any difference of opinion as to the proper person to\r\nbe selected. The retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in\r\nfavor of General McClellan for the position, and in this the nation\r\nseemed to give a unanimous concurrence. The designation of General\r\nMcClellan is therefore in considerable degree the selection of the\r\ncountry as well as of the Executive, and hence there is better reason\r\nto hope there will be given him the confidence and cordial support thus\r\nby fair implication promised, and without which he can not with so full\r\nefficiency serve the country.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones, and\r\nthe saying is true if taken to mean no more than that an army is better\r\ndirected by a single mind, though inferior, than by two superior ones\r\nat variance and cross-purposes with each other.\r\n\r\nAnd the same is true in all joint operations wherein those engaged can\r\nhave none but a common end in view and can differ only as to the choice\r\nof means. In a storm at sea no one on board can wish the ship to sink,\r\nand yet not unfrequently all go down together because too many will\r\ndirect and no single mind can be allowed to control.\r\n\r\nIt continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not\r\nexclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government--the\r\nrights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most\r\ngrave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the\r\ngeneral tone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the\r\nabridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the\r\npeople of all right to participate in the selection of public officers\r\nexcept the legislative boldly advocated, with labored arguments to\r\nprove that large control of the people in government is the source of\r\nall political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a\r\npossible refuge from the power of the people.\r\n\r\nIn my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit\r\nraising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.\r\n\r\nIt is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be\r\nmade in favor of popular institutions, but there is one point, with its\r\nconnections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief\r\nattention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with,\r\nif not above, labor in the structure of government. It is assumed that\r\nlabor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors\r\nunless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces\r\nhim to labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best\r\nthat capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their\r\nown consent, or buy them and drive them to it without their consent.\r\nHaving proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded that all laborers\r\nare either hired laborers or what we call slaves. And further, it is\r\nassumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\nNow there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor\r\nis there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the\r\ncondition of a hired laborer. Both these assumptions are false, and all\r\ninferences from them are groundless.\r\n\r\nLabor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit\r\nof labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.\r\nLabor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher\r\nconsideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of\r\nprotection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and\r\nprobably always will be, a relation between labor and capital producing\r\nmutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of\r\ncommunity exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that\r\nfew avoid labor themselves, and with their capital hire or buy another\r\nfew to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither\r\nclass--neither work for others nor have others working for them. In\r\nmost of the Southern States a majority of the whole people of all\r\ncolors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large\r\nmajority are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their families--wives,\r\nsons, and daughters--work for themselves on their farms, in their\r\nhouses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and\r\nasking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or\r\nslaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of\r\npersons mingle their own labor with capital; that is, they labor with\r\ntheir own hands and also buy or hire others to labor for them; but this\r\nis only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle stated is\r\ndisturbed by the existence of this mixed class.\r\n\r\nAgain, as has already been said, there is not of necessity any such\r\nthing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life.\r\nMany independent men everywhere in these States a few years back in\r\ntheir lives were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the\r\nworld labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools\r\nor land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and\r\nat length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and\r\ngenerous and prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hope\r\nto all, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition\r\nto all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil\r\nup from poverty; none less inclined to take or touch aught which they\r\nhave not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political\r\npower which they already possess, and which if surrendered will surely\r\nbe used to close the door of advancement against such as they and to\r\nfix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nFrom the first taking of our national census to the last are seventy\r\nyears, and we find our population at the end of the period eight times\r\nas great as it was at the beginning. The increase of those other things\r\nwhich men deem desirable has been even greater. We thus have at one\r\nview what the popular principle, applied to Government through the\r\nmachinery, of the States and the Union, has produced in a given time,\r\nand also what if firmly maintained it promises for the future. There\r\nare already among us those who if the Union be preserved will live to\r\nsee it contain 250,000,000. The struggle of to-day is not altogether\r\nfor to-day; it is for a vast future also. With a reliance on Providence\r\nall the more firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which\r\nevents have devolved upon us.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAbraham Lincoln\r\nDecember 1, 1862\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nSince your last annual assembling another year of health and bountiful\r\nharvests has passed, and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless\r\nus with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best\r\nlight He gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise way all\r\nwill yet be well.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place\r\nduring the last year is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with\r\na request to that effect made by the House of Representatives near the\r\nclose of the last session of Congress. If the condition of our\r\nrelations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually\r\nbeen at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation\r\nso unhappily distracted as we are might reasonably have apprehended. In\r\nthe month of June last there were some grounds to expect that the\r\nmaritime powers which at the beginning of our domestic difficulties so\r\nunwisely and unnecessarily, as we think, recognized the insurgents as a\r\nbelligerent would soon recede from that position, which has proved only\r\nless injurious to themselves than to our own country. But the temporary\r\nreverses which afterwards befell the national arms, and which were\r\nexaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed\r\nthat act of simple justice.\r\n\r\nThe civil war, which has so radically changed for the moment the\r\noccupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily\r\ndisturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity\r\nof the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been\r\nsteadily increasing throughout a period of half a century. It has at\r\nthe same time excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have\r\nproduced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this\r\nunusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy\r\nbetween foreign states and between parties or factions in such states.\r\nWe have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution. But\r\nwe have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of\r\nits own affairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by\r\nforeign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its\r\nsupposed and often exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to\r\nthose nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this\r\nGovernment, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise. The treaty\r\nwith Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put\r\ninto operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an\r\noccasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on\r\nthe part of Her Majesty's Government has been marked with a jealous\r\nrespect for the authority of the United States and the rights of their\r\nmoral and loyal citizens.\r\n\r\nThe convention with Hanover for the abolition of the Stade dues has\r\nbeen carried into full effect under the act of Congress for that\r\npurpose. A blockade of 3,000 miles of seacoast could not be established\r\nand vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like\r\nthe present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting\r\nunintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects. A civil\r\nwar occurring in a country, where foreigners reside and carry on trade\r\nunder treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the\r\nviolation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite\r\nmisapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between\r\nnations which have a common interest in preserving peace and\r\nfriendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have so far as possible\r\nheard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendly\r\npowers. There is still, however, a large and an augmenting number of\r\ndoubtful cases upon which the Government is unable to agree with the\r\ngovernments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are,\r\nmoreover, many cases in which the United States or their citizens\r\nsuffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations\r\nwhich the governments of those states are not at once prepared to\r\nredress. I have proposed to some of the foreign states thus interested\r\nmutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints. This\r\nproposition has been made especially to Great Britain, to France, to\r\nSpain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, but\r\nhas not yet been formally adopted.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners\r\nof the Norwegian bark Admiral P. Tordenskiold, which vessel was in May,\r\n1861, prevented by the commander of the blockading force off Charleston\r\nfrom leaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege\r\nhad shortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have directed\r\nthe Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be\r\ncommunicated to the proper committees.\r\n\r\nApplications have been made to me by many free Americans of African\r\ndescent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as\r\nwas contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home and\r\nabroad--some from interested motives, others upon patriotic\r\nconsiderations, and still others influenced by philanthropic\r\nsentiments--have suggested similar measures, while, on the other hand,\r\nseveral of the Spanish American Republics have protested against the\r\nsending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these\r\ncircumstances I have declined to move any such colony to any state\r\nwithout first obtaining the consent of its government, with an\r\nagreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the\r\nrights of freemen; and I have at the same time offered to the several\r\nStates situated within the Tropics, or having colonies there, to\r\nnegotiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nto favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their\r\nrespective territories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just, and\r\nhumane. Liberia and Hayti are as yet the only countries to which\r\ncolonists of African descent from here could go with certainty of being\r\nreceived and adopted as citizens; and I regret to say such persons\r\ncontemplating colonization do not seem so willing to migrate to those\r\ncountries as to some others, nor so willing as I think their interest\r\ndemands. I believe, however, opinion among them in this respect is\r\nimproving, and that ere long there will be an augmented and\r\nconsiderable migration to both these countries from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of\r\nTurkey has been carried into execution.\r\n\r\nA commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the\r\nSenate's consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now\r\npending with the Republic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of the\r\nnational commerce is expected to result from these measures. Our\r\nrelations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia,\r\nDenmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other\r\nEuropean States remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also\r\ncontinue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year there has not only been no change of our previous\r\nrelations with the independent States of our own continent, but more\r\nfriendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to be\r\nentertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress are so\r\nintimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to\r\nMexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile. The\r\ncommission under the convention with the Republic of New Granada closed\r\nits session without having audited and passed upon all the claims which\r\nwere submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the\r\nconvention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The joint\r\ncommission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has\r\ncompleted its labors and submitted its report. I have favored the\r\nproject for connecting the United States with Europe by an Atlantic\r\ntelegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from San\r\nFrancisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the line which is\r\nbeing extended across the Russian Empire. The Territories of the United\r\nStates, with unimportant exceptions have remained undisturbed by the\r\ncivil war; and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as\r\njustifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition\r\nto be organized as States and be constitutionally admitted into the\r\nFederal Union.\r\n\r\nThe immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be\r\ndeveloped as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would\r\nhave a tendency to improve the revenues of the Government and diminish\r\nthe burdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious consideration\r\nwhether some extraordinary measures to promote that end can not be\r\nadopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective\r\nis a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories\r\nwith a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign\r\ncountries--results which can not fail to be auspicious.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the finances will claim your most diligent\r\nconsideration. The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval\r\noperations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto\r\nbeen met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar\r\ncircumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. The\r\ncontinuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made\r\nnecessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your best\r\nreflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue\r\nwithout injury to business and with the least possible burdens upon\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the\r\ncommencement of your last session made large issues of United States\r\nnotes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops and\r\nthe satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or so well\r\nprovided for. The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the\r\nreceivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and making\r\nthem a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universal\r\ncurrency, and has satisfied, partially at least, and for the time, the\r\nlong-felt want of an uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the\r\npeople immense sums in discounts and exchanges.\r\n\r\nA return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible\r\nwith due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view.\r\nFluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to\r\nreduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a\r\nleading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain\r\nconvertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and\r\nsurest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a\r\ncirculation of United States notes payable in coin and sufficiently\r\nlarge for the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, and\r\nsafely maintained.\r\n\r\nIs there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the\r\npublic wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform\r\ncurrency secured?\r\n\r\nI know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same\r\ntime so unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations,\r\nunder a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To\r\nsuch associations the Government might furnish circulating notes, on\r\nthe security of United States bonds deposited in the Treasury. These\r\nnotes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform\r\nin appearance and security and convertible always into coin, would at\r\nonce protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and\r\nfacilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges.\r\n\r\nA moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate\r\nthe United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes and\r\na general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of\r\nthat part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit,\r\nmoreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans\r\ngreatly facilitated by the steady market demand for Government bonds\r\nwhich the adoption of the proposed system would create. It is an\r\nadditional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my\r\njudgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing\r\ninterests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to\r\nreorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform\r\nnational circulation for the local and various circulation, secured and\r\nunsecured, now issued by them.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans and\r\nbalance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30th\r\nJune, 1862, were $583,885,247.06, of which sum $49,056,397.62 were\r\nderived from customs; $1,795,331.73 from the direct tax; from public\r\nlands, $152,203.77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787.64; from loans\r\nin all forms, $529,692,460.50. The remainder, :$2,257,065.80, was the\r\nbalance from last year.\r\n\r\nThe disbursements during the same period were: For Congressional,\r\nexecutive, and judicial purposes, $5,939.009.29; for foreign\r\nintercourse, $1,339,710.35; for miscellaneous expenses, including the\r\nmints, loans, Post-Office deficiencies, collection of revenue, and\r\nother like charges, $14,129,771.50; for expenses under the Interior\r\nDepartment, 985.52; under the War Department, $394,368,407.36; under\r\nthe Navy Department, $42,674,569.69; for interest on public debt,\r\n$13,190,324.45; and for payment of public debt, including reimbursement\r\nof temporary loan and redemptions, $96,096,922.09; making an aggregate\r\nof $570,841,700.25, and leaving a balance in the Treasury on the 1st\r\nday of July, 1862, of $13,043,546.81.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922.09, expended for\r\nreimbursements and redemption of public debt, being included also in\r\nthe loans made, may be properly deducted both from receipts and\r\nexpenditures, leaving the actual receipts for the year $487,788,324.97,\r\nand the expenditures $474,744,778.16.\r\n\r\nOther information on the subject of the finances will be found in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statements and views\r\nI invite your most candid and considerate attention.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are herewith\r\ntransmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than\r\nbrief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and\r\noperations conducted through those Departments. Nor could I give a\r\nsummary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being\r\nmuch shorter than the reports themselves. I therefore content myself\r\nwith laying the reports before you and asking your attention to them.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial\r\ncondition of the Post-Office Department as compared with several\r\npreceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to\r\n$8,349,296.40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the\r\nUnion for three quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of\r\nrevenue from the so-called seceded States during the last fiscal year,\r\nthe increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been\r\nsufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90,\r\nbeing only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the\r\nUnion during the previous year. The expenditures show a still more\r\nfavorable result. The amount expended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11. For\r\nthe last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364.13, showing a\r\ndecrease of about $2,481,000 in the expenditures as compared with the\r\npreceding year, and about $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal year\r\n1860. The deficiency in the Department for the previous year was\r\n$4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to\r\n$2,112,814.57. These favorable results are in part owing to the\r\ncessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States and in part to\r\na careful review of all expenditures in that Department in the interest\r\nof economy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has\r\nalso been much improved. The Postmaster-General has also opened a\r\ncorrespondence through the Department of State with foreign governments\r\nproposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of\r\nsimplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign\r\nmails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and\r\nto the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably\r\nentertained and agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have\r\nbeen received.\r\n\r\nI ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the\r\nPostmaster-General in his report respecting the further legislation\r\nrequired, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the\r\npublic lands: The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue.\r\nFrom the 1st July, 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, the entire cash\r\nreceipts from the sale of lands were $137,476.26--a sum much less than\r\nthe expenses of our land system during the same period. The homestead\r\nlaw, which will take effect on the 1st of January next, offers such\r\ninducements to settlers that sales for cash can not be expected to an\r\nextent sufficient to meet the expenses of the General Land Office and\r\nthe cost of surveying and bringing the land into market.\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales\r\nof the public lands and the sum derived from the same source as\r\nreported from the Treasury Department arises, as I understand, from the\r\nfact that the periods of time, though apparently, were not really\r\ncoincident at the beginning point, the Treasury report including a\r\nconsiderable sum now which had previously been reported from the\r\nInterior, sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from\r\nthe three months now reported upon by the Interior and not by the\r\nTreasury. The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past\r\nyear manifested a spirit of insubordination, and at several points have\r\nengaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their\r\nvicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansas\r\nrenounced their allegiance to the United States and entered into\r\ntreaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United\r\nStates were driven from the country. The chief of the Cherokees has\r\nvisited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of\r\nthe tribe with the United States. He alleges that they were constrained\r\nby superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that\r\nthe United States neglected to furnish the protection which their\r\ntreaty stipulations required.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August last the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked the\r\nsettlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing\r\nindiscriminately men, women, and children. This attack was wholly\r\nunexpected, and therefore no means of defense had been prodded. It is\r\nestimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the Indians,\r\nand a large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was\r\ninduced is not definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust,\r\nneed not to be stated. Information was received by the Indian Bureau\r\nfrom different sources about the time hostilities were commenced that a\r\nsimultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by all\r\nthe tribes between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. The\r\nState of Minnesota has suffered great injury from this Indian war. A\r\nlarge portion of her territory has been depopulated, and a severe loss\r\nhas been sustained by the destruction of property. The people of that\r\nState manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the\r\nlimits of the State as a guaranty against future hostilities. The\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs will furnish full details. I submit for\r\nyour especial consideration whether our Indian system shall not be\r\nremodeled. Many wise and good men have impressed me with the belief\r\nthat this can be profitably done.\r\n\r\nI submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which shows\r\nthe progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the\r\nPacific Railroad. And this suggests the earliest completion of this\r\nroad, and also the favorable action of Congress upon the projects now\r\npending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in\r\nNew York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly increasing\r\nimportance to the whole nation, and especially to the vast interior\r\nregion hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length. I purpose\r\nhaving prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting\r\nand valuable statistical information upon this subject. The military\r\nand commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan Canal\r\nand improving the Illinois River is presented in the report of Colonel\r\nWebster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress. I\r\nrespectfully ask attention to it.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May\r\nlast, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States\r\nto be organized.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this\r\nDepartment has established an extensive system of correspondence and\r\nexchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly\r\nbeneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent\r\nimprovements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and\r\nin the collection of the agricultural statistics of the different\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAlso, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds,\r\ncereals, plants, and cuttings, and has already published and liberally\r\ndiffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate\r\nreport, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable\r\ntests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe creation of this Department was for the more immediate benefit of a\r\nlarge class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the liberal\r\nbasis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your\r\napprobation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest\r\nanticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful\r\nsource of advantage to all our people.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of September last a proclamation was issued by the\r\nExecutive, a copy of which is herewith submitted. In accordance with\r\nthe purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper, I now\r\nrespectfully recall your attention to what may be called \"compensated\r\nemancipation.\"\r\n\r\nA nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its\r\nlaws. The territory is the only part which is of certain durability.\r\n\"One generation passeth away and another generation cometh, but the\r\nearth abideth forever.\" It is of the first importance to duly consider\r\nand estimate this ever-enduring part. That portion of the earth's\r\nsurface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States\r\nis well adapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not\r\nwell adapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of\r\nclimate and productions are of advantage in this age for one people,\r\nwhatever they might have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and\r\nintelligence have brought these to be an advantageous combination for\r\none united people.\r\n\r\nIn the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of\r\ndisunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two\r\nsections. I did so in language which I can not improve, and which,\r\ntherefore, I beg to repeat: One section of our country believes slavery\r\nis right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong\r\nand ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The\r\nfugitive-slave clause of the Constitution and the law for the\r\nsuppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced,\r\nperhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of\r\nthe people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the\r\npeople abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break\r\nover in each. This I think, can not be perfectly cured, and it would be\r\nworse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before.\r\nThe foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be\r\nultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive\r\nslaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all\r\nby the other. Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not\r\nremove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable\r\nwall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the\r\npresence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of\r\nour country can not do this. They can not but remain face to face, and\r\nintercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is\r\nit possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more\r\nsatisfactory after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties\r\neasier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully\r\nenforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to\r\nwar, you can not fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides\r\nand no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions,\r\nas to terms of intercourse, are again upon you. There is no line,\r\nstraight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to\r\ndivide. Trace through, from east to west, upon the line between the\r\nfree and slave country, and we shall find a little more than one-third\r\nof its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon to\r\nbe populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its remaining\r\nlength are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk back and\r\nforth without any consciousness of their presence. No part of this line\r\ncan be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or\r\nparchment as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it comes,\r\ngives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive-slave clause,\r\nalong with all other constitutional obligations upon the section\r\nseceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be\r\nmade to take its place.\r\n\r\nBut there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded east\r\nby the Alleghanies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky\r\nMountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and\r\ncotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee,\r\nall of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois,\r\nMissouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota,\r\nNebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above 10,000,000 people,\r\nand will have 50,000,000 within fifty years if not prevented by any\r\npolitical folly or mistake. It contains more than one-third of the\r\ncountry owned by the United States--certainly more than 1,000,000\r\nsquare miles. Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it\r\nwould have more than 75,000,000 people. A glance at the map shows that,\r\nterritorially speaking, it is the great body of the Republic. The other\r\nparts are but marginal borders to it. The magnificent region sloping\r\nwest from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific being the deepest and also\r\nthe richest in undeveloped resources. In the production of provisions\r\ngrains, grasses, and all which proceed from them this great interior\r\nregion is naturally one of the most important in the world. Ascertain\r\nfrom the statistics the small proportion of the region which has as yet\r\nbeen brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly\r\nincreasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the\r\nmagnitude of the prospect presented. And yet this region has no\r\nseacoast--touches no ocean anywhere. As part of one nation, its people\r\nnow find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York, to\r\nSouth America and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco;\r\nbut separate our common country into two nations, as designed by the\r\npresent rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is\r\nthereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not perhaps by\r\na physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.\r\n\r\nAnd this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed.\r\nPlace it between the now free and slave country, or place it south of\r\nKentucky or north of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none south\r\nof it can trade to any port or place north of it, and none north of it\r\ncan trade to any port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated\r\nby a government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west, and south,\r\nare indispensable to the well-being of the people inhabiting and to\r\ninhabit this vast interior region. Which of the three may be the best\r\nis no proper question. All are better than either, and all of right\r\nbelong to that people and to their successors forever. True to\r\nthemselves, they will not ask where a line of separation shall be, but\r\nwill vow rather that there shall be no such line. Nor are the marginal\r\nregions less interested in these communications to and through them to\r\nthe great outside world. They, too, and each of them, must have access\r\nto this Egypt of the West without paying toll at the crossing of any\r\nnational boundary.\r\n\r\nOur national strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the\r\nland we inhabit: not from our national homestead. There is no possible\r\nsevering of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In\r\nall its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors\r\nseparation. In fact, it would ere long force reunion, however much of\r\nblood and treasure the separation might have cost. Our strife pertains\r\nto ourselves--to the passing generations of men--and it can without\r\nconvulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one generation.\r\n\r\nIn this view I recommend the adoption of the following resolution and\r\narticles amendatory to the Constitution of the United States: Resolved\r\nby the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of\r\nAmerica in Congress assembled (two-thirds of both Houses concurring),\r\nThat the following articles be proposed to the legislatures (or\r\nconventions) of the several States as amendments to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, all or any of which articles, when ratified by\r\nthree-fourths of the said legislatures (or conventions ), to be valid\r\nas part or parts of the said Constitution, viz:\r\n\r\nART.--. Every State wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish the\r\nsame therein at any time or times before the 1st day of January, A. D.\r\n1900, shall receive compensation from the United States as follows, to\r\nwit:\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States shall deliver to every such State\r\nbonds of the United States bearing interest at the rate of per cent per\r\nannum to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of ____ for each slave\r\nshown to have been therein by the Eighth Census of the United States,\r\nsaid bonds to be delivered to such State by installments or in one\r\nparcel at the completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same\r\nshall have been gradual or at one time within such State; and interest\r\nshall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its\r\ndelivery as aforesaid. Any State having received bonds as aforesaid and\r\nafterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein shall refund to\r\nthe United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and all\r\ninterest paid thereon.\r\n\r\nART.--All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances\r\nof the war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever\r\nfree; but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall be\r\ncompensated for them at the same rates as is provided for States\r\nadopting abolishment of slavery, but in such way that no slave shall be\r\ntwice accounted for.\r\n\r\nART.--Congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for\r\ncolonizing free colored persons with their own consent at any place or\r\nplaces without the United States.\r\n\r\nI beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length.\r\nWithout slavery the rebellion could never have existed; without slavery\r\nit could not continue.\r\n\r\nAmong the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment\r\nand of policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst us.\r\nSome would perpetuate slavery; some would abolish it suddenly and\r\nwithout compensation; some would abolish it gradually and with\r\ncompensation: some would remove the freed people from us, and some\r\nwould retain them with us; and there are yet other minor diversities.\r\nBecause of these diversities we waste much strength in struggles among\r\nourselves. By mutual concession we should harmonize and act together.\r\nThis would be compromise, but it would be compromise among the friends\r\nand not with the enemies of the Union. These articles are intended to\r\nembody a plan of such mutual concessions. If the plan shall be adopted,\r\nit is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least in several of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAs to the first article, the main points are, first, the emancipation;\r\nsecondly, the length of time for consummating it (thirty-seven years);\r\nand, thirdly, the compensation.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual\r\nslavery, but the length of time should greatly mitigate their\r\ndissatisfaction. The time spares both races from the evils of sudden\r\nderangement--in fact, from the necessity of any derangement--while most\r\nof those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the\r\nmeasure will have passed away before its consummation. They will never\r\nsee it. Another class will hail the prospect of emancipation, but will\r\ndeprecate the length of time. They will feel that it gives too little\r\nto the now living slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them\r\nfrom the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate\r\nemancipation in localities where their numbers are very great, and it\r\ngives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free\r\nforever. The plan leaves to each State choosing to act under it to\r\nabolish slavery now or at the end of the century, or at any\r\nintermediate time, or by degrees extending over the whole or any part\r\nof the period, and it obliges no two States to proceed alike. It also\r\nprovides for compensation, and generally the mode of making it. This,\r\nit would seem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who\r\nfavor perpetual slavery, and especially of those who are to receive the\r\ncompensation. Doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive\r\nwill object. Yet the measure is both just and economical. In a certain\r\nsense the liberation of slaves is the destruction of property--property\r\nacquired by descent or by purchase, the same as any other property. It\r\nis no less true for having been often said that the people of the South\r\nare not more responsible for the original introduction of this property\r\nthan are the people of the North; and when it is remembered how\r\nunhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar and share the profits of\r\ndealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the South has\r\nbeen more responsible than the North for its continuance. If, then, for\r\na common object this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that\r\nit be done at a common charge?\r\n\r\nAnd if with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the\r\nbenefits of the Union by this means than we can by the war alone, is it\r\nnot also economical to do it? Let us consider it, then. Let us\r\nascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensated\r\nemancipation was proposed last March, and consider whether if that\r\nmeasure had been promptly accepted by even some of the slave States the\r\nsame sum would not have done more to close the war than has been\r\notherwise done. If so, the measure would save money, and in that view\r\nwould be a prudent and economical measure. Certainly it is not so easy\r\nto pay something as it is to pay nothing, but it is easier to pay a\r\nlarge sum than it is to pay a larger one. And it is easier to pay any\r\nsum when we are able than it is to pay it before we are able. The war\r\nrequires large sums, and requires them at once. The aggregate sum\r\nnecessary for compensated emancipation of course would be large. But it\r\nwould require no ready cash, nor the bonds even any faster than the\r\nemancipation progresses. This might not, and probably would not, close\r\nbefore the end of the thirty-seven years. At that time we shall\r\nprobably have a hundred millions of people to share the burden, instead\r\nof thirty-one millions as now. And not only so, but the increase of our\r\npopulation may be expected to continue for a long time after that\r\nperiod as rapidly as before, because our territory will not have become\r\nfull. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio of\r\nincrease which we have maintained, on an average, from our first\r\nnational census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should in 1900 have a\r\npopulation of 103,208,415. And why may we not continue that ratio far\r\nbeyond that period? Our abundant room, our broad national homestead, is\r\nour ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the British\r\nIsles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated.\r\nInstead of receiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled to\r\nsend part of the native born away. But such is not our condition. We\r\nhave 2,963,000 square miles. Europe has 3,800,000, with a population\r\naveraging 73 1/3 persons to the square mile. Why may not our country at\r\nsome time average as many? Is it less fertile? Has it more waste\r\nsurface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes? Is it\r\ninferior to Europe in any natural advantage? If, then, we are at some\r\ntime to be as populous as Europe, how soon? As to when this may be, we\r\ncan judge by the past and the present; as to when it will be, if ever,\r\ndepends much on whether we maintain the Union. Several of our States\r\nare already above the average of Europe 73 1/3 to the square mile.\r\nMassachusetts has 157; Rhode Island, 133; Connecticut, 99; New York and\r\nNew Jersey, each 80. Also two other great States, Pennsylvania and\r\nOhio, are not far below, the former having 63 and the latter 59. The\r\nStates already above the European average, except New York, have\r\nincreased in as rapid a ratio since passing that point as ever before,\r\nwhile no one of them is equal to some other parts of our country in\r\nnatural capacity for sustaining a dense population.\r\n\r\nTaking the nation in the aggregate, and we find its population and\r\nratio of increase for the several decennial periods to be as follows:\r\n\r\nYear - Population - Ratio of increase.\r\n\r\n- - Per cent.\r\n\r\n1790 - 3,929,827 - ..........\r\n\r\n1800 - 5,304,937 - 35.02\r\n\r\n1810 - 7,239,814 - 36.45\r\n\r\n1820 - 9,638,131 - 36.45\r\n\r\n1830 - 12,866,020 - 33.49\r\n\r\n1840 - 17,069,453 - 32.67\r\n\r\n1850 - 23,191,876 - 35.87\r\n\r\n1860 - 31,443,790 - 35.58\r\n\r\nThis shows an average decennial increase of 34.60 per cent in\r\npopulation through the seventy years from our first to our last census\r\nyet taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase at no one of these\r\nseven periods is either 2 per cent below or 2 per cent above the\r\naverage, thus showing how inflexible, and consequently how reliable,\r\nthe law of increase in our case is. Assuming that it will continue, it\r\ngives the following results:\r\n\r\nYear - Population\r\n\r\n1870 - 42,323,341\r\n\r\n1880 - 56,967,216\r\n\r\n1890 - 76,677,872\r\n\r\n1900 - 103,208,415\r\n\r\n1910 - 138,918,526\r\n\r\n1920 - 186,984,335\r\n\r\n1930 - 251,680,914\r\n\r\nThese figures show that our country may be as populous as Europe now is\r\nat some point between 1920 and 1930--say about 1925--our territory, at\r\n73 1/3 persons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain\r\n217,186,000.\r\n\r\nAnd we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the\r\nchance by the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war\r\nspringing from the only great element of national discord among us.\r\nWhile it can not be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of\r\nsecession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population,\r\ncivilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it\r\nwould be very great and injurious.\r\n\r\nThe proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace,\r\ninsure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of\r\nthe country. With these we should pay all the emancipation would cost,\r\ntogether with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt\r\nwithout it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at 6 per\r\ncent per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary\r\nstruggle until to-day, without paying anything on either principal or\r\ninterest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each\r\nman owed upon it then; and this because our increase of men through the\r\nwhole period has been greater than 6 per cent--has run faster than the\r\ninterest upon the debt. Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation, so\r\nlong as its population increases faster than unpaid interest\r\naccumulates on its debt.\r\n\r\nThis fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly\r\ndue, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection--the\r\ngreat advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we\r\nnumber 100,000,000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now,\r\nwhen we number but 31,000,000. In a word, it shows that a dollar will\r\nbe much harder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for\r\nemancipation on the proposed plan. And then the latter will cost no\r\nblood, no precious life. It will be a saving of both.\r\n\r\nAs to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return\r\nto bondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them,\r\ndoubtless, in the property sense belong to loyal owners, and hence\r\nprovision is made in this article for compensating such. The third\r\narticle relates to the future of the freed people. It does not oblige,\r\nbut merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may\r\nconsent. This ought not to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand\r\nor on the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual\r\nconsent of the people to be deported and the American voters, through\r\ntheir representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nI can not make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor\r\ncolonization; and yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against\r\nfree colored persons remaining in the country which is largely\r\nimaginary, if not sometimes malicious.\r\n\r\nIt is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white\r\nlabor and white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere\r\ncatch arguments, that time surely is not now. In times like the present\r\nmen should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be\r\nresponsible through time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that\r\ncolored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by\r\nremaining slaves? If they stay in their old places, they jostle no\r\nwhite laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them open to\r\nwhite laborers. Logically, there is neither more nor less of it.\r\nEmancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the\r\nwages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them. Thus the\r\ncustomary amount of labor would still have to be performed--the freed\r\npeople would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, and\r\nvery probably for a time would do less, leaving an increased part to\r\nwhite laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and\r\nconsequently enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a\r\nlimited extent, enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically\r\ncertain. Labor is like any other commodity in the market--increase the\r\ndemand for it and you increase the price of it. Reduce the supply of\r\nblack labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and by\r\nprecisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of white labor.\r\n\r\nBut it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the\r\nwhole land. Are they not already in the land? Will liberation make them\r\nany more numerous? Equally distributed among the whites of the whole\r\ncountry, and there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the\r\none in any way greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities\r\nnow having more than one free colored person to seven whites and this\r\nwithout any apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District of\r\nColumbia and the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this\r\ncondition. The District has more than one free colored to six whites,\r\nand yet in its frequent petitions to Congress I believe it has never\r\npresented the presence of free colored persons as one of its\r\ngrievances. But why should emancipation South send the free people\r\nNorth? People of any color seldom run unless there be something to run\r\nfrom. Heretofore colored people to some extent have fled North from\r\nbondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage and destitution. But if\r\ngradual emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither\r\nto flee from. Their old masters will give them wages at least until new\r\nlaborers can be procured, and the freedmen in turn will gladly give\r\ntheir labor for the wages till new homes can be found for them in\r\ncongenial climes and with people of their own blood and race. This\r\nproposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved. And in any\r\nevent, can not the North decide for itself whether to receive them?\r\n\r\nAgain, as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there been\r\nany irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of\r\nslavery in this District last spring?\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the\r\nwhites in the District is from the census of 1860, having no reference\r\nto persons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of\r\nCongress abolishing slavery here.\r\n\r\nThe plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a\r\nrestoration of the national authority would be accepted without its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nNor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of September\r\n22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. Its\r\ntimely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nAnd notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide\r\nby law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation before\r\nthis plan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. Such\r\nwould be only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply\r\nto both.\r\n\r\nThis plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but\r\nadditional to, all others for restoring and preserving the national\r\nauthority throughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in\r\nits economical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace\r\nmore speedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by\r\nforce alone, while all it would cost, considering amounts and manner of\r\npayment and times of payment, would be easier paid than will be the\r\nadditional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force. It is much,\r\nvery much, that it would cost no blood at all.\r\n\r\nThe plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It can not become\r\nsuch without the concurrence of, first, two-thirds of Congress, and\r\nafterwards three-fourths of the States. The requisite three-fourths of\r\nthe States will necessarily include seven of the slave States. Their\r\nconcurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally\r\nadopting emancipation at no very distant day upon the new\r\nconstitutional terms. This assurance would end the struggle now and\r\nsave the Union forever.\r\n\r\nI do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed\r\nto the Congress of the nation by the Chief Magistrate of the nation,\r\nnor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you\r\nhave more experience than I in the conduct of public affairs. Yet I\r\ntrust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will\r\nperceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I\r\nmay seem to display.\r\n\r\nIs it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten\r\nthe war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is it\r\ndoubted that it would restore the national authority and national\r\nprosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we\r\nhere--Congress and Executive can secure its adoption? Will not the good\r\npeople respond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can\r\nthey, by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital\r\nobjects? We can succeed only by concert. It is not \"Can any of us\r\nimagine better?\" but \"Can we all do better?\" Object whatsoever is\r\npossible, still the question recurs, \"Can we do better?\" The dogmas of\r\nthe quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is\r\npiled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our\r\ncase is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall\r\nourselves, and then we shall save our country.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, we can not escape history. We of this Congress and\r\nthis Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No\r\npersonal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us.\r\nThe fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or\r\ndishonor to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The\r\nworld will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union.\r\nThe world knows we do know how to save it. We, even we here, hold the\r\npower and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave we\r\nassure freedom to the free--honorable alike in what we give and what we\r\npreserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of\r\nearth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain,\r\npeaceful, generous, just--a way which if followed the world will\r\nforever applaud and God must forever bless.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAbraham Lincoln\r\nDecember 8, 1863\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nAnother year of health and of sufficiently abundant harvests has\r\npassed. For these, and especially for the improved condition of our\r\nnational affairs, our renewed and profoundest gratitude to God is due.\r\n\r\nWe remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us in\r\nforeign wars to aid an inexcusable insurrection have been unavailing.\r\nHer Britannic Majesty's Government, as was justly expected, have\r\nexercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile\r\nexpeditions from British ports. The Emperor of France has by a like\r\nproceeding promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at\r\nthe beginning of the contest. Questions of great intricacy and\r\nimportance have arisen out of the blockade and other belligerent\r\noperations between the Government and several of the maritime powers,\r\nbut they have been discussed and, as far as was possible, accommodated\r\nin a spirit of frankness, justice, and mutual good will. It is\r\nespecially gratifying that our prize courts, by the impartiality of\r\ntheir adjudications, have commanded the respect and confidence of\r\nmaritime powers.\r\n\r\nThe supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain for\r\nthe suppression of the African slave trade, made on the 17th day of\r\nFebruary last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution. It is\r\nbelieved that so far as American ports and American citizens are\r\nconcerned that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end.\r\n\r\nI shall submit for the consideration of the Senate a convention for the\r\nadjustment of possessory claims in Washington Territory arising out of\r\nthe treaty of the 15th June, 1846, between the United States and Great\r\nBritain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among the\r\ncitizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country.\r\n\r\nA novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime\r\njurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island of Cuba,\r\nhas been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed in\r\nan amicable spirit to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power.\r\nA convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the Senate, to\r\nconcur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the\r\nliquidation of the Scheldt dues, upon the principles which have been\r\nheretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the\r\nwaters of Denmark. The long-pending controversy between this\r\nGovernment and that of Chile touching the seizure at Sitana, in Peru,\r\nby Chilean officers, of a large amount in treasure belonging to\r\ncitizens of the United States has been brought to a close by the award\r\nof His Majesty the King of the Belgians, to whose arbitration the\r\nquestion was referred by the parties. The subject was thoroughly and\r\npatiently examined by that justly respected magistrate, and although\r\nthe sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as large as they\r\nexpected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of His Majesty's\r\ndecision. That decision was promptly complied with by Chile when\r\nintelligence in regard to it reached that country.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission under the act of the last session for carrying\r\ninto effect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims has been\r\norganized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it.\r\n\r\nDifficulties concerning interoceanic transit through Nicaragua are in\r\ncourse of amicable adjustment.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message, I\r\nhave received a representative from the United States of Colombia, and\r\nhave accredited a minister to that Republic.\r\n\r\nIncidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon\r\nmy attention the uncertain state of international questions touching\r\nthe rights of foreigners in this country and of United States citizens\r\nabroad. In regard to some governments these rights are at least\r\npartially, defined by treaties. In no instance, however, is it\r\nexpressly stipulated that in the event of civil war a foreigner\r\nresiding in this country within the lines of the insurgents is to be\r\nexempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent, in whose\r\nbehalf the Government or his country can not expect any privileges or\r\nimmunities distinct from that character. I regret to say, however, that\r\nsuch claims have been put forward, and in some instances in behalf of\r\nforeigners who have lived in the United States the greater part of\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries\r\nwho have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been\r\nfully naturalized, have evaded the military duty required of them by\r\ndenying the fact and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden of\r\nproof. It has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this\r\nproof, from the want of guides to the proper sources of information.\r\nThese might be supplied by requiring clerks of courts where\r\ndeclarations of intention may be made or naturalizations effected to\r\nsend periodically lists of the names of the persons naturalized or\r\ndeclaring their intention to become citizens to the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, in whose Department those names might be arranged and printed\r\nfor general information.\r\n\r\nThere is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become\r\ncitizens of the United States for the sole purpose of evading duties\r\nimposed by the laws of their native countries, to which on becoming\r\nnaturalized here they at once repair, and though never returning to the\r\nUnited States they still claim the interposition of this Government as\r\ncitizens. Many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisen\r\nout of this abuse. It is therefore submitted to your serious\r\nconsideration. It might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no\r\ncitizen of the United States residing abroad may claim the\r\ninterposition of his Government.\r\n\r\nThe right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens\r\nunder pretenses of naturalization, which they have disavowed when\r\ndrafted into the military service. I submit the expediency of such an\r\namendment of the law as will make the fact of voting an estoppel\r\nagainst any plea of exemption from military service or other civil\r\nobligation on the ground of alienage.\r\n\r\nIn common with other Western powers, our relations with Japan have been\r\nbrought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the\r\nhereditary aristocracy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberal\r\npolicy of the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society of\r\nnations. It is hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these\r\ndifficulties may be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to the\r\nclaim of the minister residing there for the damages he sustained in\r\nthe destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at Yedo.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia,\r\nwhich, it is believed, will result in effecting a continuous line of\r\ntelegraph through that Empire from our Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an\r\ninternational telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also of a\r\ntelegraph between this capital and the national forts along the\r\nAtlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. Such communications,\r\nestablished with any reasonable outlay, would be economical as well as\r\neffective aids to the diplomatic, military, and naval service.\r\n\r\nThe consular system of the United States, under the enactments of the\r\nlast Congress, begins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to\r\nhope that it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which\r\nwill ensue whenever peace is restored. Our ministers abroad have been\r\nfaithful in defending American rights. In protecting commercial\r\ninterests our consuls have necessarily had to encounter increased\r\nlabors and responsibilities growing out of the war. These they have for\r\nthe most part met and discharged with zeal and efficiency. This\r\nacknowledgment justly includes those consuls who, residing in Morocco,\r\nEgypt, Turkey, Japan, China, and other Oriental countries, are charged\r\nwith complex functions and extraordinary powers.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the several organized Territories is generally\r\nsatisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been\r\nentirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho,\r\nNew Mexico, and Arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore\r\nunderstood. I lay before you a communication on this subject from the\r\ngovernor of New Mexico. I again submit to your consideration the\r\nexpediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of\r\nimmigration. Although this source of national wealth and strength is\r\nagain flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the\r\ninsurrection occurred, there is still a great deficiency of laborers in\r\nevery field of industry, especially in agriculture and in our mines, as\r\nwell of iron and coal as of the precious metals. While the demand for\r\nlabor is much increased here, tens of thousands of persons, destitute\r\nof remunerative occupation, are thronging our foreign consulates and\r\noffering to emigrate to the United States if essential, but very cheap,\r\nassistance can be afforded them. It is easy to see that under the sharp\r\ndiscipline of civil war the nation is beginning a new life. This noble\r\neffort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\nInjuries unforeseen by the Government and unintended may in some cases\r\nhave been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries,\r\nboth at sea and on land, by persons in the service of the United\r\nStates. As this Government expects redress from other powers when\r\nsimilar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon\r\ncitizens of the United States, we must be prepared to do justice to\r\nforeigners. If the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to this\r\npurpose, a special court may be authorized, with power to hear and\r\ndecide such claims of the character referred to as may have arisen\r\nunder treaties and the public law. Conventions for adjusting the claims\r\nby joint commission have been proposed to some governments, but no\r\ndefinitive answer to the proposition has yet been received from any.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the session I shall probably have occasion to request\r\nyou to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of\r\nrestitution have been rendered and damages awarded by admiralty courts,\r\nand in other cases where this Government may be acknowledged to be\r\nliable in principle and where the amount of that liability has been\r\nascertained by an informal arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by\r\nthe law of the United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon the\r\nincomes of foreign consuls in this country. While such a demand may not\r\nin strictness be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any\r\nexisting treaty between the United States and a foreign country, the\r\nexpediency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income\r\nof such consuls as are not citizens of the United States, derived from\r\nthe emoluments of their office or from property not situated in the\r\nUnited States, is submitted to your serious consideration. I make this\r\nsuggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated\r\nexempts our consuls in all other countries from taxation to the extent\r\nthus indicated. The United States, I think, ought not to be\r\nexceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Treasury during the last year have been\r\nsuccessfully conducted. The enactment by Congress of a national banking\r\nlaw has proved a valuable support of the public credit and the general\r\nlegislation in relation to loans has fully answered the expectations of\r\nits favorers. Some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws,\r\nbut no change in their principles or general scope is believed to be\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nSince these measures have been in operation all demands on the\r\nTreasury, including the pay of the Army and Navy, have been promptly\r\nmet and fully satisfied. No considerable body of troops, it is\r\nbelieved, were ever more amply provided and more liberally and\r\npunctually paid, and it may be added that by no people were the burdens\r\nincident to a great war ever more cheerfully borne.\r\n\r\nThe receipts during the year from all sources, including loans and\r\nbalance in the Treasury at its commencement, were $901,125,674.86, and\r\nthe aggregate disbursements $895,796,630.65, leaving a balance on the\r\n1st of July, 1863, of $5,329,044.21. Of the receipts there were derived\r\nfrom customs $69,059,642.40, from internal revenue $37,640,787.95, from\r\ndirect tax $1,485,103.61, from lands $167,617.17, from miscellaneous\r\nsources $3,046,615.35, and from loans $776,682,361.57, making the\r\naggregate $901,125,674.86. Of the disbursements there were for the\r\ncivil service $23,253,922.08, for pensions and Indians $4,216,520.79,\r\nfor interest on public debt $24,729,846.51, for the War Department\r\n$599,298,600.83, for the Navy Department $63,211,105.27, for payment of\r\nfunded and temporary debt $181,086,635.07, making the aggregate\r\n$895,796,630.65 and leaving the balance of $5,329,044.21. But the\r\npayment of funded and temporary debt, having been made from moneys\r\nborrowed during the year, must be regarded as merely nominal payments\r\nand the moneys borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts, and\r\ntheir amount, $181,086,635.07, should therefore be deducted both from\r\nreceipts and disbursements. This being done there remains as actual\r\nreceipts $720,039,039.79 and the actual disbursements $714,709,995.58,\r\nleaving the balance as already stated.\r\n\r\nThe actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the\r\nestimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three quarters\r\nof the current fiscal year (1864) will be shown in detail by the report\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury, to which I invite your attention. It\r\nis sufficient to say here that it is not believed that actual results\r\nwill exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than\r\nthe estimates of that officer heretofore submitted, while it is\r\nconfidently expected that at the close of the year both disbursements\r\nand debt will be found very considerably less than has been\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War is a document of great interest. It\r\nconsists of--\r\n\r\n1. The military operations of the year, detailed in the report of the\r\nGeneral in Chief. 2. The organization of colored persons into the war\r\nservice. 3. The exchange of prisoners, fully set forth in the letter of\r\nGeneral Hitchcock. 4. The operations under the act for enrolling and\r\ncalling out the national forces, detailed in the report of the\r\nProvost-Marshal-General. 5. The organization of the invalid\r\ncorps, and 6. The operation of the several departments of the\r\nQuartermaster-General, Commissary-General, Paymaster-General, Chief of\r\nEngineers, Chief of Ordnance, and Surgeon-General.\r\n\r\nIt has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report,\r\nexcept such as would be too extended for this place, and hence I\r\ncontent myself by asking your careful attention to the report itself.\r\n\r\nThe duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year\r\nand throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have been discharged\r\nwith fidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been\r\nconstantly increasing in efficiency as the Navy has expanded, yet on so\r\nlong a line it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit\r\ntrade. From returns received at the Navy Department it appears that\r\nmore than 1,000 vessels have been captured since the blockade was\r\ninstituted, and that the value of prizes already sent in for\r\nadjudication amounts to over $13,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe naval force of the United States consists at this time of 588\r\nvessels completed and in the course of completion, and of these 75 are\r\nironclad or armored steamers. The events of the war give an increased\r\ninterest and importance to the Navy which will probably extend beyond\r\nthe war itself.\r\n\r\nThe armored vessels in our Navy completed and in service, or which are\r\nunder contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed in\r\nnumber those of any other power; but while these may be relied upon for\r\nharbor defense and coast service, others of greater strength and\r\ncapacity will be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain our\r\nrightful position on the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare\r\nsince the introduction of steam as a motive power for ships of war\r\ndemands either a corresponding change in some of our existing\r\nnavy-yards or the establishment of new ones for the construction and\r\nnecessary repair of modern naval vessels. No inconsiderable\r\nembarrassment, delay, and public injury have been experienced from the\r\nwant of such governmental establishments. The necessity of such a\r\nnavy-yard, so furnished, at some suitable place upon the Atlantic\r\nseaboard has on repeated occasions been brought to the attention of\r\nCongress by the Navy Department, and is again presented in the report\r\nof the Secretary which accompanies this communication. I think it my\r\nduty to invite your special attention to this subject, and also to that\r\nof establishing a yard and depot for naval purposes upon one of the\r\nWestern rivers. A naval force has been created on those interior\r\nwaters, and under many disadvantages, within little more than two\r\nyears, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the\r\ncommencement of the present Administration. Satisfactory and important\r\nas have been the performances of the heroic men of the Navy at this\r\ninteresting period, they are scarcely more wonderful than the success\r\nof our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels, which\r\nhas created a new form of naval power.\r\n\r\nOur country has advantages superior to any other nation in our\r\nresources of iron and timber, with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of both, and all available and in close\r\nproximity to navigable waters. Without the advantage of public works,\r\nthe resources of the nation have been developed and its power displayed\r\nin the construction of a Navy of such magnitude, which has at the very\r\nperiod of its creation rendered signal service to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7,500\r\nmen in the spring of 1861 to about 34,000 at the present time has been\r\naccomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties to\r\npromote that increase. It has been found, however, that the operation\r\nof the draft, with the high bounties paid for army recruits, is\r\nbeginning to affect injuriously the naval service, and will, if not\r\ncorrected, be likely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from\r\ntheir proper vocation and inducing them to enter the Army. I therefore\r\nrespectfully suggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval\r\nservices by a definite provision on this subject which would at the\r\nsame time be equitable to the communities more especially interested.\r\n\r\nI commend to your consideration the suggestions of the Secretary of the\r\nNavy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen and also\r\nthe education of officers and engineers for the naval service. The\r\nNaval Academy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen for\r\nthe highly responsible duties which in after life they will be required\r\nto perform. In order that the country should not be deprived of the\r\nproper quota of educated officers, for which legal provision has been\r\nmade at the naval school, the vacancies caused by the neglect or\r\nomission to make nominations from the States in insurrection have been\r\nfilled by the Secretary of the Navy. The school is now more full and\r\ncomplete than at any former period, and in every respect entitled to\r\nthe favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the past fiscal year the financial condition of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment has been one of increasing prosperity, and I am gratified in\r\nbeing able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaled\r\nthe entire expenditures, the latter amounting to $11,314,206.84 and the\r\nformer to $11,163,789.59, leaving a deficiency of but $150,417.25. In\r\n1860, the year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency\r\namounted to $5,656,705.49, the postal receipts of that year being\r\n$2,645,722.19 less than those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the\r\nannual amount of transportation has been only about 25 per cent, but\r\nthe annual expenditure on account of the same has been reduced 35 per\r\ncent. It is manifest, therefore, that the Post-Office Department may\r\nbecome self-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of the\r\nwhole service.\r\n\r\nThe international conference of postal delegates from the principal\r\ncountries of Europe and America, which was called at the suggestion of\r\nthe Postmaster-General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last and\r\nconcluded its deliberations on the 8th of June. The principles\r\nestablished by the conference as best adapted to facilitate postal\r\nintercourse between nations and as the basis of future postal\r\nconventions inaugurate a general system of uniform international\r\ncharges at reduced rates of postage, and can not fail to produce\r\nbeneficial results.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is\r\nherewith laid before you, for useful and varied information in relation\r\nto the public lands, Indian affairs, patents, pensions, and other\r\nmatters of public concern pertaining to his Department.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarter\r\nof the present fiscal years was 3,841,549 acres, of which 161,911 acres\r\nwere sold for cash, 1,456,514 acres were taken up under the homestead\r\nlaw, and the residue disposed of under laws granting lands for military\r\nbounties, for railroad and other purposes. It also appears that the\r\nsale of the public lands is largely on the increase.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmen\r\nthat the people of the United States had a higher and more enduring\r\ninterest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the\r\npublic lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from\r\nthe sale of them. This opinion has had a controlling influence in\r\nshaping legislation upon the subject of our national domain. I may cite\r\nas evidence of this the liberal measures adopted in reference to actual\r\nsettlers; the grant to the States of the overflowed lands within their\r\nlimits, in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for\r\ncultivation; the grants to railway companies of alternate sections of\r\nland upon the contemplated issues of their roads, which when completed\r\nwill so largely multiply the facilities for reaching our distant\r\npossessions. This policy has received its most signal and beneficent\r\nillustration in the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual\r\nsettlers. Since the 1st day of January last the before-mentioned\r\nquantity of 1,456,514 acres of land have been taken up under its\r\nprovisions. This fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying\r\nevidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands,\r\nnotwithstanding the great struggle in which the energies of the nation\r\nhave been engaged, and which has required so large a withdrawal of our\r\ncitizens from their accustomed pursuits. I cordially concur in the\r\nrecommendation of the Secretary of the Interior suggesting a\r\nmodification of the act in favor of those engaged in the military and\r\nnaval service of the United States. I doubt not that Congress will\r\ncheerfully adopt such measures as will, without essentially changing\r\nthe general features of the system, secure to the greatest practicable\r\nextent its benefits to those who have left their homes in the defense\r\nof the country in this arduous crisis.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the views of the Secretary as to the\r\npropriety of raising by appropriate legislation a revenue from the\r\nmineral lands of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe measures provided at your last session for the removal of certain\r\nIndian tribes have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been\r\nnegotiated, which will in due time be submitted for the constitutional\r\naction of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the\r\npossessory rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of lands.\r\nIt is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in the\r\nestablishment of permanent friendly relations with such of these tribes\r\nas have been brought into frequent and bloody collision with our\r\noutlying settlements and emigrants. Sound policy and our imperative\r\nduty to these wards of the Government demand our anxious and constant\r\nattention to their material well-being, to their progress in the arts\r\nof civilization, and, above all, to that moral training which under the\r\nblessing of Divine Providence will confer upon them the elevated and\r\nsanctifying influences, the hopes and consolations, of the Christian\r\nfaith. I suggested in my last annual message the propriety of\r\nremodeling our Indian system. Subsequent events have satisfied me of\r\nits necessity. The details set forth in the report of the Secretary\r\nevince the urgent need for immediate legislative action.\r\n\r\nI commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the\r\nGovernment in this District to your generous and fostering care. The\r\nattention of Congress during the last session was engaged to some\r\nextent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between\r\nthe Mississippi River and the northeastern seaboard, which proposition,\r\nhowever, failed for the time. Since then, upon a call of the greatest\r\nrespectability, a convention has been held at Chicago upon the same\r\nsubject, a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed\r\nto the President and Congress, and which I now have the honor to lay\r\nbefore you. That this interest is one which ere long will force its own\r\nway I do not entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your\r\nwisdom as to what can be done now. Augmented interest is given to this\r\nsubject by the actual commencement of work upon the Pacific Railroad,\r\nunder auspices so favorable to rapid progress and completion. The\r\nenlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road.\r\n\r\nI transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in\r\nthat vital interest of the nation. When Congress assembled a year ago,\r\nthe war had already lasted nearly twenty months, and there had been\r\nmany conflicts on both land and sea, with varying results; the\r\nrebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits; yet the tone of\r\npublic feeling and opinion, at home and abroad was not satisfactory.\r\nWith other signs, the popular elections then just past indicated\r\nuneasiness among ourselves, while, amid much that was cold and\r\nmenacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accents\r\nof pity that we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Our\r\ncommerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and\r\nfurnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened with such\r\nadditions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea\r\nand raise our blockade. We had failed to elicit from European\r\nGovernments anything hopeful upon this subject. The preliminary\r\nemancipation proclamation, issued in September, was running its\r\nassigned period to the beginning of the new year. A month later the\r\nfinal proclamation came, including the announcement that colored men of\r\nsuitable condition would be received into the war service. The policy\r\nof emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a\r\nnew aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain\r\nconflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil\r\nadministration, the General Government had no lawful power to effect\r\nemancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that\r\nthe rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military\r\nmeasure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it\r\nmight come, and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then\r\nbe presented. It came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark\r\nand doubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to\r\ntake another review. The rebel borders are pressed still farther back,\r\nand by the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated by\r\nthe rebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practical\r\ncommunication between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been\r\nsubstantially cleared of insurgent control, and influential citizens in\r\neach, owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the\r\nrebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respective\r\nStates. Of those States not included in the emancipation proclamation,\r\nMaryland and Missouri, neither of which three years ago would tolerate\r\nany restraint upon the extension of slavery into new Territories, only\r\ndispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits.\r\n\r\nOf those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100,000\r\nare now in the United States military service, about one-half of which\r\nnumber actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double\r\nadvantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and\r\nsupplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white\r\nmen. So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as good\r\nsoldiers as any. No servile insurrection or tendency to violence or\r\ncruelty has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks.\r\nThese measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and,\r\ncontemporary with such discussion, the tone of public sentiment there\r\nis much improved. At home the same measures have been fully discussed,\r\nsupported, criticised, and denounced, and the annual elections\r\nfollowing are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to\r\nbear the country through this great trial. Thus we have the new\r\nreckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the\r\nUnion is past.\r\n\r\nLooking now to the present and future, and with reference to a\r\nresumption of the national authority within the States wherein that\r\nauthority has been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a\r\nproclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. On examination\r\nof this proclamation it will appear, as is believed, that nothing will\r\nbe attempted beyond what is amply justified by the Constitution. True,\r\nthe form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. The man\r\nis only promised a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the oath. The\r\nConstitution authorizes the Executive to grant or withhold the pardon\r\nat his own absolute discretion, and this includes the power to grant on\r\nterms, as is fully established by judicial and other authorities.\r\n\r\nIt is also proffered that if in any of the States named a State\r\ngovernment shall be in the mode prescribed set up, such government\r\nshall be recognized and guaranteed by the United States, and that under\r\nit the State shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected\r\nagainst invasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation\r\nof the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a\r\nrepublican form of government and to protect the State in the cases\r\nstated is explicit and full. But why tender the benefits of this\r\nprovision only to a State government set up in this particular way?\r\nThis section of the Constitution contemplates a case wherein the\r\nelement within a State favorable to republican government in the Union\r\nmay be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to or\r\neven within the State, and such are precisely the cases with which we\r\nare now dealing.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State government,\r\nconstructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element\r\nagainst whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simply\r\nabsurd. There must be a test by which to separate the opposing\r\nelements, so as to build only from the sound; and that test is a\r\nsufficiently liberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a\r\nsworn recantation of his former unsoundness.\r\n\r\nBut if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political\r\nbody an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and\r\nto the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regard\r\nto slavery? Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for\r\nthe purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them\r\ntheir fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. In\r\nmy judgment, they have aided and will further aid the cause for which\r\nthey were intended. To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish\r\na lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of\r\nfaith. I may add at this point that while I remain in my present\r\nposition I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation\r\nproclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by\r\nthe terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress. For\r\nthese and other reasons it is thought best that support of these\r\nmeasures shall be included in the oath, and it is believed the\r\nExecutive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of\r\nforfeited rights, which he has clear constitutional power to withhold\r\naltogether or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the\r\npublic interest. It should be observed also that this part of the oath\r\nis subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and\r\nsupreme judicial decision.\r\n\r\nThe proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any reasonable\r\ntemporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the view\r\nof possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best\r\nattend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole\r\nStates. It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those\r\nStates may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their\r\naffliction if to this extent this vital matter be left to themselves,\r\nwhile no power of the National Executive to prevent an abuse is\r\nabridged by the proposition.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political\r\nframework of the States on what is called reconstruction is made in the\r\nhope that it may do good without danger of harm. It will save labor and\r\navoid great confusion.\r\n\r\nBut why any proclamation now upon this subject? This question is beset\r\nwith the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or\r\nbe taken too soon. In some States the elements for resumption seem\r\nready for action, but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying\r\npoint--a plan of action, Why shall A adopt the plan of B rather than B\r\nthat of A? And if A and B should agree, how can they know but that the\r\nGeneral Government here will reject their plan? By the proclamation a\r\nplan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point,\r\nand which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This\r\nmay bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would. The objections\r\nto a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive consist\r\nin the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left\r\nto further developments. Care has been taken to so shape the document\r\nas to avoid embarrassments from this source. Saying that on certain\r\nterms certain classes will be pardoned with rights restored, it is not\r\nsaid that other classes or other terms will never be in included.\r\nSaying specified way, it is said that reconstruction will be accepted\r\nif presented in a not said it will never be accepted in any other way.\r\n\r\nThe movements by State action for emancipation in several of the States\r\nnot included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profound\r\ngratulation. And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore\r\nso earnestly urged upon this subject, my general views and feelings\r\nremain unchanged; and I trust that Congress will omit no fair\r\nopportunity of aiding these important steps to a great consummation. In\r\nthe midst of other cares, however important, we must not lose sight of\r\nthe fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that power\r\nalone can we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in\r\nthe contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun\r\nthem. Until that confidence shall be established little can be done\r\nanywhere for what is called reconstruction. Hence our chiefest care\r\nmust still be directed to the Army and Navy, who have thus far borne\r\ntheir harder part so nobly and well; and it may be esteemed fortunate\r\nthat in giving the greatest efficiency to these indispensable arms we\r\ndo also honorably recognize the gallant men, from commander to\r\nsentinel, who compose them, and to whom more than to others the world\r\nmust stand indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled, regenerated,\r\nenlarged, and perpetuated.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAbraham Lincoln\r\nDecember 6, 1864\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nAgain the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our\r\nprofoundest gratitude to Almighty God.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory.\r\n\r\nMexico continues to be a theater of civil war. While our political\r\nrelations with that country have undergone no change, we have at the\r\nsame time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a competent\r\nengineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan and\r\nthe port of San Juan. It is a source of much satisfaction that the\r\ndifficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions\r\nand caused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have been\r\namicably adjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route\r\nwill soon be reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation. We\r\ncould not exaggerate either the commercial or the political importance\r\nof that great improvement.\r\n\r\nIt would be doing injustice to an important South American State not to\r\nacknowledge the directness, frankness, and cordiality with which the\r\nUnited States of Colombia have entered into intimate relations with\r\nthis Government. A claims convention has been constituted to complete\r\nthe unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861.\r\n\r\nThe new liberal constitution of Venezuela having gone into effect with\r\nthe universal acquiescence of the people, the Government under it has\r\nbeen recognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a\r\ncordial and friendly spirit. The long-deferred Aves Island claim has\r\nbeen satisfactorily paid and discharged.\r\n\r\nMutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint\r\ncommission for the settlement of claims between the United States and\r\nPeru. An earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the\r\ntwo countries, and such efforts as were in my power have been used to\r\nremove misunderstanding and avert a threatened war between Peru and\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nOur relations are of the most friendly nature with Chile, the Argentine\r\nRepublic, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Salvador, and Hayti.\r\nDuring the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of\r\nthose Republics, and, on the other hand, their sympathies with the\r\nUnited States are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness.\r\n\r\nThe claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macedonian\r\nin 1821 has been paid in full by the Government of Chile. Civil war\r\ncontinues in the Spanish part of San Domingo, apparently without\r\nprospect of an early close.\r\n\r\nOfficial correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it\r\ngives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that\r\nRepublic. It may be expected to derive new vigor from American\r\ninfluence, improved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI solicit your authority to furnish to the Republic a gunboat at\r\nmoderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by installments.\r\nSuch a vessel is needed for the safety of that State against the native\r\nAfrican races, and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in\r\narresting the African slave trade than a squadron in our own hands. The\r\npossession of the least organized naval force would stimulate a\r\ngenerous ambition in the Republic, and the confidence which we should\r\nmanifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor toward the\r\ncolony from all civilized nations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, by the way\r\nof Behrings Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by\r\nCongress at the last session, has been undertaken, under very favorable\r\ncircumstances, by an association of American citizens, with the cordial\r\ngood will and support as well of this Government as of those of Great\r\nBritain and Russia. Assurances have been received from most of the\r\nSouth American States of their high appreciation of the enterprise and\r\ntheir readiness to cooperate in constructing lines tributary to that\r\nworld-encircling communication. I learn with much satisfaction that the\r\nnoble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast\r\nof America and Great Britain has been renewed, with full expectation of\r\nits early accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country\r\nwill be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career\r\nof commerce and civilization.\r\n\r\nOur very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in April\r\nlast. An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary\r\nincumbent of the office and the Government of the Pasha resulted in a\r\nsuspension of intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on the\r\narrival of the successor in the consulate, and our relations with\r\nEgypt, as well as our relations with the Barbary Powers, are entirely\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China has at last been\r\nsuppressed, with the cooperating good offices of this Government and of\r\nthe other Western commercial States. The judicial consular\r\nestablishment there has become very difficult and onerous, and it will\r\nneed legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce\r\nand to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the\r\nGovernment and people of that vast Empire. China seems to be accepting\r\nwith hearty good will the conventional laws which regulate commercial\r\nand social intercourse among the Western nations.\r\n\r\nOwing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of its\r\nGovernment, the action of that Empire in performing treaty stipulations\r\nis inconstant and capricious. Nevertheless, good progress has been\r\neffected by the Western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our\r\nown pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement,\r\nand the inland sea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also\r\nto believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished\r\nthe friendship of Japan toward the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened by\r\nproclamation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider\r\nwhether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as\r\njust to the United States, to resort to these and other open ports than\r\nit is to pursue, through many hazards and at vast cost, a contraband\r\ntrade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual military\r\noccupation, at least by a lawful and effective blockade.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive,\r\nunder the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an\r\nasylum in the United States. If Congress should think that proceedings\r\nin such cases lack the authority of law, or ought to be further\r\nregulated by it, I recommend that provision be made for effectually\r\npreventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities\r\nfor their criminal occupation in our country.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that if it were new and open question the maritime\r\npowers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not concede the\r\nprivileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United\r\nStates, destitute, as they are, and always have been, equally of ships\r\nof war and of ports and harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither\r\nless assiduous nor more successful during the last year than they were\r\nbefore that time in their efforts under favor of that privilege, to\r\nembroil our country in foreign wars. The desire and determination of\r\nthe governments of the maritime states to defeat that design are\r\nbelieved to be as sincere as and can not be more earnest than our own.\r\nNevertheless, unforeseen political difficulties have arisen, especially\r\nin Brazilian and British ports and on the northern boundary of the\r\nUnited States, which have required, and are likely to continue to\r\nrequire, the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory\r\nspirit on the part of the United States, as well as of the nations\r\nconcerned and their governments.\r\n\r\nCommissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain\r\non the adjustment of the claims of the Hudsons Bay and Pugets Sound\r\nAgricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the\r\nexecution of the trust assigned to them.\r\n\r\nIn view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent\r\nto the Canadian border, by reason of recent assaults and depredations\r\ncommitted by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it\r\nhas been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six\r\nmonths, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement\r\nwith Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty\r\nto increase their naval armament upon the Lakes if they shall find that\r\nproceeding necessary. The condition of the border will necessarily come\r\ninto consideration in connection with the question of continuing or\r\nmodifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States,\r\nas well as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily\r\nestablished by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th June, 1854.\r\n\r\nI desire, however, to be understood while making this statement that\r\nthe colonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally\r\nunjust or unfriendly toward the United States, but, on the contrary,\r\nthere is every reason to expect that, with the approval of the Imperial\r\nGovernment, they will take the necessary measures to prevent new\r\nincursions across the border.\r\n\r\nThe act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration\r\nhas so far as was possible been put into operation. It seems to need\r\namendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent\r\nthe practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on\r\ntheir arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of\r\navocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition toward this\r\ngreat national policy is manifested by most of the European States, and\r\nought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective\r\nnational protection. I regard our immigrants as one of the principal\r\nreplenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the\r\nravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health.\r\nAll that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its\r\npresent fullness, and to that end the Government must in every way make\r\nit manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary\r\nmilitary service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot\r\nin our country.\r\n\r\nThe financial affairs of the Government have been successfully\r\nadministered during the last year. The legislation of the last session\r\nof Congress has beneficially affected the revenues, although sufficient\r\ntime has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of\r\nthe provisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation.\r\n\r\nThe receipts during the year from all sources, upon the basis of\r\nwarrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and\r\nthe balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were\r\n$1,394,796,007.62, and the aggregate disbursements, upon the same\r\nbasis, were $1,298,056,101.89, leaving a balance in the Treasury, as\r\nshown by warrants, of $96,739,905.73.\r\n\r\nDeduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public\r\ndebt redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, and\r\nthe actual cash operations of the Treasury were: Receipts,\r\n$884,076,646.57; disbursements, $865,234,087.86; which leaves a cash\r\nbalance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71.\r\n\r\nOf the receipts there were derived from customs $102,316,152.99, from\r\nlands $588,333.29, from direct taxes $475,648.96, from internal revenue\r\n$109,741,134.10, from miscellaneous sources $47,511,448.10, and from\r\nloans applied to actual expenditures, including former balance,\r\n$623,443,929.13.\r\n\r\nThere were disbursed for the civil service $27,505,599.46, for pensions\r\nand Indians $7,517,930.97, for the War Department $690,791,842.97, for\r\nthe Navy Department $85,733,292.77, for interest on the public debt\r\n$53,685,421.69, making an aggregate of $865,234,087.86 and leaving a\r\nbalance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71, as before stated.\r\n\r\nFor the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the\r\nestimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters\r\nof the current fiscal year, and the general operations of the Treasury\r\nin detail, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\nI concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required\r\nto meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation\r\nshould be still further increased; and I earnestly invite your\r\nattention to this subject, to the end that there may be such additional\r\nlegislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on the 1st day of July last, as appears by the books of\r\nthe Treasury, amounted to $1,740,690,489.49. Probably, should the war\r\ncontinue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from\r\nfive hundred millions. Held, as it is, for the most part by our own\r\npeople, it has become a substantial branch of national, though private,\r\nproperty. For obvious reasons the more nearly this property can be\r\ndistributed among all the people the better. To favor such general\r\ndistribution, greater inducements to become owners might, perhaps, with\r\ngood effect and without injury be presented to persons of limited\r\nmeans. With this view I suggest whether it might not be both competent\r\nand expedient for Congress to provide that a limited amount of some\r\nfuture issue of public securities might be held by any bona fide\r\npurchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under such\r\nrestrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard against\r\nabuse of so important a privilege. This would enable every prudent\r\nperson to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want.\r\n\r\nPrivileges like these would render the possession of such securities to\r\nthe amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who\r\nmight be able to save enough for the purpose. The great advantage of\r\ncitizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public\r\ndebt is obvious. Men readily perceive that they can not be much\r\noppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on the 1st day of July last, although somewhat\r\nexceeding the estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to\r\nCongress at the commencement of the last session, falls short of the\r\nestimate of that officer made in the preceding December as to its\r\nprobable amount at the beginning of this year by the sum of\r\n$3,995,097.31. This fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct\r\nof the operations of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists\r\nand to the people. On the 25th day of November 584 national banks had\r\nbeen organized, a considerable number of which were conversions from\r\nState banks. Changes from State systems to the national system are\r\nrapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon there will be in\r\nthe United States no banks of issue not authorized by Congress and no\r\nbank-note circulation not secured by the Government. That the\r\nGovernment and the people will derive great benefit from this change in\r\nthe banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned. The\r\nnational system will create a reliable and permanent influence in\r\nsupport of the national credit and protect the people against losses in\r\nthe use of paper money. Whether or not any further legislation is\r\nadvisable for the suppression of State-bank issues it will be for\r\nCongress to determine. It seems quite clear that the Treasury can not\r\nbe satisfactorily conducted unless the Government can exercise a\r\nrestraining power over the bank-note circulation of the country. The\r\nreport of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will\r\ndetail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the\r\nlast annual message, and also the operations of the several\r\nadministrative bureaus of the War Department during the last year. It\r\nwill also specify the measures deemed essential for the national\r\ndefense and to keep up and supply the requisite military force.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and\r\nsatisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the naval\r\nservice. It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our\r\ncountrymen that a Navy of such vast proportions has been organized in\r\nso brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success.\r\n\r\nThe general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under construction\r\non the 1st of December, 1864, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying\r\n4,610 guns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during the\r\nyear, over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83\r\nvessels, 167 guns, and 42,427 tons.\r\n\r\nThe total number of men at this time in the naval service, including\r\nofficers, is about 51,000.\r\n\r\nThere have been captured by the Navy during the year 324 vessels, and\r\nthe whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is\r\n1,379, of which 267 are steamers.\r\n\r\nThe gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property\r\nthus far reported amount to $14,396,250.51. A large amount of such\r\nproceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditure of the Navy Department of every description,\r\nincluding the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into\r\nexistence from the 4th of March, 1861, to the 1st of November, 1864, is\r\n$238,647,262.35.\r\n\r\nYour favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations\r\nof the Secretary of the Navy, especially in regard to a navy-yard and\r\nsuitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels\r\nand the machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference was\r\nmade in my last annual message.\r\n\r\nYour attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in\r\nrelation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respect\r\nto prize on our inland waters.\r\n\r\nI cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the\r\npropriety of creating the new rank of vice-admiral in our naval\r\nservice. Your attention is invited to the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General for a detailed account of the operations and\r\nfinancial condition of the Post-Office Department.\r\n\r\nThe postal revenues for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to\r\n$12,438,253.78 and the expenditures to $12,644,786.20, the excess of\r\nexpenditures over receipts being $206,652.42.\r\n\r\nThe views presented by the Postmaster-General on the subject of special\r\ngrants by the Government in aid of the establishment of new lines of\r\nocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development\r\nof increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring\r\ncountries should receive the careful consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population,\r\nimprovement, and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied\r\nportions of our country have scarcely been checked, much less impeded\r\nor destroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seem\r\nto have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been\r\ncompleted in conformity with law, and thus our excellent system is\r\nfirmly established in the mountains, which once seemed a barren and\r\nuninhabitable waste between the Atlantic States and those which have\r\ngrown up on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity\r\nand rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance\r\nand the interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities,\r\nhave been only partially organized; but it is understood that these\r\ndifficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their\r\ngovernments, like those of the others, to go into speedy and full\r\noperation. As intimately connected with and promotive of this material\r\ngrowth of the nation, I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable\r\ninformation and important recommendations relating to the public lands,\r\nIndian affairs, the Pacific Railroad, and mineral discoveries contained\r\nin the report of the Secretary of the Interior which is herewith\r\ntransmitted, and which report also embraces the subjects of patents,\r\npensions, and other topics of public interest pertaining to his\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending\r\non the 30th of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614\r\nacres were entered under the homestead law. The remainder was located\r\nwith military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States for\r\nrailroads, and sold for cash. The cash received from sales and location\r\nfees was $1,019,446.\r\n\r\nThe income from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, was\r\n$678,007.21, against $136,077.95 received during the preceding year.\r\nThe aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal\r\nto the quantity disposed of, and there is open to settlement about\r\n133,000,000 acres of surveyed land.\r\n\r\nThe great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific States\r\nby railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that\r\ngives assurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising\r\nfrom the prevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of\r\nthe main line of the road has been definitely located for 100 miles\r\nwestward from the initial point at Omaha City, Nebr., and a preliminary\r\nlocation of the Pacific Railroad of California has been made from\r\nSacramento eastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada.\r\nNumerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cinnabar mines have been\r\nadded to the many heretofore known, and the country occupied by the\r\nSierra Nevada and Rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems\r\nwith enterprising labor, which is richly remunerative. It is believed\r\nthat the product of the mines of precious metals in that region has\r\nduring the year reached, if not exceeded, one hundred millions in\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIt was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be\r\nremodeled. Congress at its last session, acting upon the\r\nrecommendation, did provide for reorganizing the system in California,\r\nand it is believed that under the present organization the management\r\nof the Indians there will be attended with reasonable success. Much yet\r\nremains to be done to provide for the proper government of the Indians\r\nin other parts of the country, to render it secure for the advancing\r\nset-tier, and to provide for the welfare of the Indian. The Secretary\r\nreiterates his recommendations, and to them the attention of Congress\r\nis invited.\r\n\r\nThe liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid\r\nsoldiers and sailors of the Republic and to the widows, orphans, and\r\ndependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease\r\ncontracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have\r\nbeen diligently administered. There have been added to the pension\r\nrolls during the year ending the 30th day of June last the names of\r\n16,770 invalid soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present\r\nnumber of army invalid pensioners 22,767 and of navy invalid pensioners\r\n712.\r\n\r\nOf widows, orphans, and mothers 22,198 have been placed on the army\r\npension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number of army\r\npensioners of this class is 25,433 and of navy pensioners 793. At the\r\nbeginning of the year the number of Revolutionary pensioners was 1,430.\r\nOnly 12 of them were soldiers, of whom 7 have since died. The remainder\r\nare those who under the law receive pensions because of relationship to\r\nRevolutionary soldiers. During the year ending the 30th of June, 1864,\r\n$4,504,616.92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes.\r\n\r\nI cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent\r\ninstitutions of the District of Columbia which have hitherto been\r\nestablished or fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer for\r\ninformation concerning them and in relation to the Washington Aqueduct,\r\nthe Capitol, and other matters of local interest to the report of the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Department, under the supervision of its present\r\nenergetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending itself to the great\r\nand vital interest it was created to advance It is peculiarly the\r\npeople's Department, in which they feel more directly concerned than in\r\nany other. I commend it to the continued attention and fostering care\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe war continues. Since the last annual message all the important\r\nlines and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained\r\nand our arms have steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions left\r\nin rear, so that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other\r\nStates have again produced reasonably fair crops.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is\r\nGeneral Sherman's attempted march of 300 miles directly through the\r\ninsurgent region. It tends to show a great increase of our relative\r\nstrength that our General in Chief should feel able to confront and\r\nhold in check every active force of the enemy, and yet to detach a\r\nwell-appointed large army to move on such an expedition. The result not\r\nyet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged.\r\n\r\nImportant movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of\r\nmolding society for durability in the Union. Although short of complete\r\nsuccess, it is much in the fight direction that 12,000 citizens in each\r\nof the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State\r\ngovernments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to\r\nmaintain and administer them. The movements in the same direction, more\r\nextensive though less definite, in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee\r\nshould not be overlooked. But Maryland presents the example of complete\r\nsuccess. Maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future.\r\nThe genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul\r\nspirit being driven out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo her\r\nno-more.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of the\r\nConstitution abolishing slavery throughout the United States passed the\r\nSenate, but failed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. Although the present is the same Congress and\r\nnearly the same members, and without questioning the wisdom or\r\npatriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the\r\nreconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session. Of\r\ncourse the abstract question is not changed; but in intervening\r\nelection shows almost certainly that the next Congress will pass the\r\nmeasure if this does not. Hence there is only a question of time as to\r\nwhen the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action. And\r\nas it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the\r\nbetter? It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on\r\nmembers to change their views or their votes any further than, as an\r\nadditional element to be considered, their judgment may be affected by\r\nit. It is the voice of the people now for the first time heard upon the\r\nquestion. In a great national crisis like ours unanimity of action\r\namong those seeking a common end is very desirable--almost\r\nindispensable. And yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable\r\nunless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority simply\r\nbecause it is the will of the majority. In this case the common end is\r\nthe maintenance of the Union, and among the means to secure that end\r\nsuch will, through the election, is most dearly declared in favor of\r\nsuch constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\nThe most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is\r\nderived through our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass\r\nand its result, the purpose of the people within the loyal States to\r\nmaintain the integrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearly\r\nunanimous than now. The extraordinary calmness and good order with\r\nwhich the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls give strong\r\nassurance of this. Not only all those who supported the Union ticket,\r\nso called, but a great majority of the opposing party also may be\r\nfairly claimed to entertain and to be actuated by the same purpose. It\r\nis an unanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any\r\noffice whatever, high or low, has ventured to seek votes on the avowal\r\nthat he was for giving up the Union. There have been much impugning of\r\nmotives and much heated controversy as to the proper means and best\r\nmode of advancing the Union cause, but on the distinct issue of Union\r\nor no Union the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that\r\nthere is no diversity among the people. In affording the people the\r\nfair opportunity of showing one to another and to the world this\r\nfirmness and unanimity of purpose, the election has been of vast value\r\nto the national cause.\r\n\r\nThe election has exhibited another tact not less valuable to be\r\nknown--the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most\r\nimportant branch of national resources, that of living men. While it is\r\nmelancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves and\r\ncarried mourning to so many hearts, it is some relief to know that,\r\ncompared with the surviving, the fallen have been so few. While corps\r\nand divisions and brigades and regiments have formed and fought and\r\ndwindled and gone out of existence, a great majority of the men who\r\ncomposed them are still living. The same is true of the naval service.\r\nThe election returns prove this. So many voters could not else be\r\nfound. The States regularly holding elections, both now and four years\r\nago, to wit, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana,\r\nIowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,\r\nMissouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon,\r\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, east\r\n3,982,011 votes now, against 3,870,222 cast then, showing an aggregate\r\nnow of 3,982,011. To this is to be added 33,762 cast now in the new\r\nStates of Kansas and Nevada, which States did not vote in 1860, thus\r\nswelling the aggregate to 4,015,773 and the net increase during the\r\nthree years and a half of war to 145,551. A table is appended showing\r\nparticulars. To this again should be added the number of all soldiers\r\nin the field from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, and California, who by the laws of those States\r\ncould not vote away from their homes, and which number can not be less\r\nthan 90,000. Nor yet is this all. The number in organized Territories\r\nis triple now what it was four years ago, while thousands, white and\r\nblack, join us as the national arms press back the insurgent lines. So\r\nmuch is shown, affirmatively and negatively, by the election. It is not\r\nmaterial to inquire how the increase has been produced or to show that\r\nit would have been greater but for the war, which is probably true. The\r\nimportant fact remains demonstrated that we have more men now than we\r\nhad when the war began; that we are not exhausted nor in process of\r\nexhaustion; that we are gaining strength and may if need be maintain\r\nthe contest indefinitely. This as to men. Material resources are now\r\nmore complete and abundant than ever.\r\n\r\nThe national resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as we believe,\r\ninexhaustible. The public purpose to reestablish and maintain the\r\nnational authority is unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable. The\r\nmanner of continuing the effort remains to choose. On careful\r\nconsideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no\r\nattempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any\r\ngood. He would accept nothing short of severance of the Union,\r\nprecisely what we will not and can not give. His declarations to this\r\neffect are explicit and oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive\r\nus. He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves. He can not\r\nvoluntarily reaccept the Union; we can not voluntarily yield it.\r\nBetween him and us the issue is distinct, simple, and inflexible. It is\r\nan issue which can only be tried by war and decided by victory. If we\r\nyield, we are beaten; if the Southern people fail him, he is beaten.\r\nEither way it would be the victory and defeat following war. What is\r\ntrue, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause is not necessarily\r\ntrue of those who follow. Although he can not reaccept the Union, they\r\ncan. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and reunion. The\r\nnumber of such may increase. They can at any moment have peace simply\r\nby laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority\r\nunder the Constitution. Alter so much the Government could not, if it\r\nwould, maintain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain or\r\nallow it. If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the\r\npeaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operating\r\nonly in constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain, and other\r\npossible, questions are and would be beyond the Executive power to\r\nadjust; as, for instance, the admission of members into Congress and\r\nwhatever might require the appropriation of money. The Executive power\r\nitself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war.\r\nPardons and remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be within\r\nExecutive control. In what spirit and temper this control would be\r\nexercised can be fairly judged of by the past.\r\n\r\nA year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were\r\noffered to all except certain designated classes, and it was at the\r\nsame time made known that the excepted classes were still within\r\ncontemplation of special clemency. During the year many availed\r\nthemselves of the general provision, and many more would, only that the\r\nsigns of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as\r\nrendered the practical process less easy and certain. During the same\r\ntime also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the\r\nexcepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied. Thus\r\npractically the door has been for a full year open to all except such\r\nas were not in condition to make free choice; that is, such as were in\r\ncustody or under constraint. It is still so open to all. But the time\r\nmay come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it be\r\nclosed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be\r\nadopted. In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the\r\nnational authority on the part of the insurgents as the only\r\nindispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the\r\nGovernment, I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat\r\nthe declaration made a year a ago, that \"while I remain in my present\r\nposition I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation\r\nproclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by\r\nthe terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress.\" If\r\nthe people should, by whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty\r\nto re-enslave such persons, another, and not I, must be their\r\ninstrument to perform it. In stating a single condition of peace I mean\r\nsimply to say that the war will cease on the part of the Government\r\nwhenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable showing the aggregate votes in the States named, at the presidential\r\nelection respectively in 1860 and 1864.\r\n\r\nState          1860       1864\r\n\r\nCalifornia    118,840    *110,000\r\n\r\nConnecticut    77,246      86,616\r\n\r\nDelaware       16,039      16,924\r\n\r\nIllinois       339,693    348,235\r\n\r\nIndiana        272,143    280,645\r\n\r\nIowa           128,331    143,331\r\n\r\nKentucky       146,216    *91,300\r\n\r\nMaine          97,918     115,141\r\n\r\nMaryland       92,502      72,703\r\n\r\nMassachusetts 169,533     175,487\r\n\r\nMichigan      154,747     162,413\r\n\r\nMinnesota      34,799      42,534\r\n\r\nMissouri      165,538     *90,000\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire  65,953      69,111\r\n\r\nNew Jersey    121,125     128,680\r\n\r\nNew York      675,156     730,664\r\n\r\nOhio           42,441     470,745\r\n\r\nOregon         14,410     +14,410\r\n\r\nPennsylvania  476,442     572,697\r\n\r\nRhode Island   19,931      22,187\r\n\r\nVermont        42,844      55,811\r\n\r\nWest Virginia  46,195      33,874\r\n\r\nWisconsin     152,180     148,513\r\n            ---------    --------\r\n            3,870,222    3,982,01\r\n                         --------\r\nKansas                     17,234\r\n\r\nNevada                     16,528\r\n                         --------\r\n                           33,762\r\n                        3,982,011\r\n                         --------\r\n    Total               4,015,773\r\n                        3,870,222\r\n                         --------\r\n    Net increase          145,551\r\n\r\n*Nearly.       +Estimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's State of the Union Addresses, by Abraham Lincoln",
