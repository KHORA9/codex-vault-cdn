BRANCH,\r\n\r\n       In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United\r\n             States for the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Life of Stephen H. Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Horace Greeley and myself were in conversation over our breakfast\r\nat the Graham House, Goss escorted Fred Douglas and lady to the table,\r\nwho took seats near us. I knew not who they were, nor do I know that\r\nGreeley did, but I think he did. They had arrived the previous night,\r\nand this was my first knowledge that Goss kept colored boarders, who\r\npolitely helped them, and took a seat beside them, and conversed on\r\ntheir favorite theme of anti-slavery. I stared at Goss and Fred and lady\r\nand at Greeley, who gave me a sly glance, and ate his bran mush and\r\nmolasses as though nothing unusual was transpiring. I finished my mush,\r\nand retired, and felt that Goss had perpetrated a gross impropriety. And\r\nalthough I was then teaching negroes in the kitchens of New York, amid\r\nslush and kettles and frying pans, and thus evinced my warm desire to\r\nelevate the whole African race, yet my feelings were so grossly outraged\r\nby this unnatural and disgusting amalgamation, that I went to Major\r\nMordecah M. Noah, (who published a daily evening paper,) and told him\r\nthe whole story, who opened a tremendous broadside on Greeley, who dared\r\nNoah to reveal the name of his informant, although he knew I must be the\r\nman. I besought Noah not to disclose my name, as I did not desire to\r\nhave a controversy with Greeley about Graham bread and Africans. Noah\r\npromised he would not, but he discharged such caustic and unceasing\r\nbroadsides, and poked so much fun at Greeley, for breakfasting with\r\nnegroes, that he again ferociously demanded Noah to disclose the name of\r\nhis cowardly informant. I again implored Noah to stand firmly, and not\r\nto divulge my name. Noah said that he did not see how he could avoid it,\r\nas Greeley had made such a savage demand. But I induced him, after long\r\nand plaintive importunity, not to expose me, and Noah soon withdrew his\r\nforces from Africa, and attacked Greeley on his native hills of America,\r\non the subject of the Tariff and other themes. And in their deluge of\r\nwords and detraction, I did not molest Noah, nor any of his descendants,\r\nsave to pawn some of my traps occasionally to pay Goss my weekly board.\r\nGreeley snarled and growled at me for weeks, but he had a conciliatory\r\nnature, and magnanimously forgave me, and, (as after the quarrels of two\r\nenthusiastic lovers,) we were better friends than ever. I admired the\r\nhumor and genial nature of Major Noah, and I respected the\r\ntranscendental talents of Horace Greeley, but I did not wish to be\r\ndevoured by their gladiatorial collisions, although I was the sole\r\norigin of their editorial combat. Rhode Island was now on the verge of\r\ncivil war. My father addressed the first assemblage at the old Town\r\nHouse, in Providence, against the revolutionary doctrines of Thomas\r\nWilson Dorr, and harangued the friend’s of Law and Order in various\r\nparts of the State. My brother Henry came to New York, and told me that\r\nmy father had received letters from the insurgents, warning him to\r\nprepare to meet his God, and was insulted by ruffians while crossing\r\nProvidence bridge, who threatened to destroy his property, if he did not\r\ncease his inflammatory speeches against them, and that father defied\r\nthem, and told them that they might burn his houses, but they could not\r\nburn his land. I went to Providence, and was saluted by father in tones\r\nof the purest affection. I slept at his house, for several nights, and\r\njoined the City Guards, and my company was assigned a position on the\r\nwest side of the bridge, to guard the city from sunset till sunrise.\r\nNews came that old General Green’s Kentish Guards, (cherished by\r\nWashington,) of East Greenwich, commanded by Captain Allen, had fired on\r\nthe insurgents at Pawtucket, five miles from Providence, and killed and\r\nwounded half a dozen of the rebels, and my Company was immediately sent\r\nto relieve the Kentish Guards. Just prior to entering Pawtucket, the\r\nDorr women belched from their doors and windows the most disgusting\r\nejaculations, and I heard one virago exclaim: “An’t you a precious gang\r\nof soldiers? You look as though Providence had taken a powerful emetic.”\r\nThis was a hard dose, but it came from one who bore the form and garb of\r\na lady, and we had to swallow it without a murmur. Ex-Governor Earle\r\ncame from Pawtucket on the wings of lightning, and told us it would be\r\ninstant death for us to enter Pawtucket without more men, but, much to\r\nmy regret, our Captain ordered us to follow him into the town, whose\r\nstreets were crowded with desperate outlaws, who were hooting and\r\nhurling stones and fragments of iron at the Kentish Guards, who were\r\nliterally surrounded by the mob. When Captain Allen saw our Company\r\napproach, he instantly arrayed us against the insurgents for fatal\r\naction, and, taking out his watch, told the beligerent thousands\r\npresent, that if they did not disperse in ten minutes, he would fire\r\nupon them. I suffered more in these ten minutes, than in all my life,\r\nbecause I feared the rascals wouldn’t go, and we would have to fire at\r\nthem. I had the dyspepsia most horribly, and had all my pockets stuffed\r\nwith chunks of Graham bread, for a warrior’s rations, and was reduced to\r\nan utter skeleton, and could hardly hold my heavy musket\r\nperpendicularly, and my bones fairly rattled when the bloody words of\r\nCaptain Allen fell upon my ears. I had never fired a gun but once, and\r\nthat was at a snake at Topsfield, Massachusetts, and although the muzzle\r\nwas within an inch of his head, the ball passed into the ground, and the\r\nsnake fled before I could reload my gun. And yet I feared I might shed\r\nhuman blood, and perhaps kill one or more, if Captain Allen ordered my\r\nCompany to fire at the Dorrites. And I was very sure I would fall like a\r\ndead man, from the effect upon my dyspeptic nerves of fright and\r\nthundering noise caused by the simultaneous discharge of one hundred\r\nmuskets. And I actually envied the rebels who could escape from peril,\r\nwhile I could not, as I had a gun, cap and knapsack, and was hemmed in\r\nby my comrades. I could not exchange my clothes, and was closely watched\r\nby the insurgents, and if I left the ranks, I might be shot by my own\r\ncompanions in arms, and if I escaped their fire, the insurgents\r\nthemselves might instantly dispatch me. The fatal ten minutes had nearly\r\nexpired, and I supposed my time had come, as I felt sure if we fired,\r\nthat two thousand ruffians would rush upon us, and hack us to bleeding\r\nfragments. I looked up to the brilliant stars, but with all their\r\ncheerfulness and fascination, I feared to have my soul approach their\r\nglittering realms. I looked down upon the green earth, and I desired not\r\nan eternal abode for my butchered carcase below its fragrant surface. To\r\nkill a man I thought would be horrible, and forever cause unpleasant\r\ndreams. But to be killed myself, by the enemy, seemed still more\r\nhorrible. And I resolved to put nothing but powder in my gun, so that I\r\ncould not kill or wound the Dorrites. I regretted that I could not slyly\r\ntell them of my humane resolves, so that they could evince similar\r\nclemency towards me, when we came together hand to hand, and foot to\r\nfoot, and nails to nails, and nose to nose, and belly to belly, and\r\nteeth to teeth. The ten minutes elapsed, and the rebels remained and\r\nyelled and stoned and defied us. Captain Allen passed along the line,\r\nand told us we had got bloody work before us, and besought us to be\r\nfirm, and reload our muskets quickly, and fire at the hearts of our\r\nadversaries, and we would conquer them, although they numbered\r\nthousands, and we only hundreds. I came near falling at this\r\nintelligence, and leaned very heavily against the soldiers on either\r\nside of me, who threatened to shoot me if I didn’t stand straighter,\r\nwhich straightened me mighty quick. Captain Allen spoke of American\r\npatriotism, and our duty to our native State, and to the United States,\r\nand of the valor of Green and Perry, but I scarcely heard what he said,\r\nas my terrified mind was contemplating the horrors of an instant and\r\nbloody doom, and my gloomy prospects beyond the grave. Captain Allen\r\ntakes out his watch, and draws his sword, and I look towards Heaven, and\r\nengage in a most solemn silent prayer, as I now expect to die in about\r\nfive minutes.\r\n\r\n                   (To be continued to my last gun.)\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A Primary Election at Peter Cooper’s Funny Little Grocery-Groggery, at\r\n       the corner of the Bowery and Stuyversant Street, in 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HALF AN HOUR BEFORE DAYLIGHT.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Well, Jack, where are all the boys you promised me?\r\n\r\n_Jack_—They are asleep in the market.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Zounds! Jack! Arouse them, or we are lost.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—They have one eye open, and the gilded stuff will soon open the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Jack, what do you mean? Have I not kept open house for three\r\ndays and nights, and swilled yourself and comrades with liquor for a\r\nweek, and haven’t you all been drunk at my expense for several days? By\r\nJupiter! Jack! you won’t desert me, after drinking so much of my best\r\nrum, will you?\r\n\r\n_Jack_—The boys won’t expose their eyes and nose, and teeth and skulls,\r\nand bellies to the sharp claws and big fists, and stones and clubs of\r\nyour political adversaries, without some money in advance, to tickle the\r\npalms of the surgeon and nurses at the Hospital. For doctors and nurses\r\nwon’t trust the poor, you know, and especially the boys who get their\r\nskulls cracked at the primary elections.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Well, Jack, tell the boys that I will fill them with good rum\r\nuntil the primary election is over, and then, if I am victorious in the\r\nNominating Convention, I’ll reward them liberally with money.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—(With his fingers whirling like a windmill over his nose)—The\r\nboys an’t so green as to trust the politicians until they have fought\r\ntheir bloody sieges, and elected them to offices where they can steal\r\nfortunes from the people, including many a chunk of choice grub from our\r\nown mouths. No, no, Peter. It won’t do. Down with the cash, and all will\r\ngo well.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Have I not often got yourself and friends out of the Watch\r\nHouse?\r\n\r\n_Jack_—And have we not long bought your grog, although you adulterated\r\nit more than other liquor dealers? And have we not fought your public\r\nbattles, and exposed ourselves to imprisonment, and periled our lives to\r\ngive you political influence to liberate us from the Watch House, when\r\nwe got into a bad scrape on your account?\r\n\r\n_Peter_—You lie, you thief and drunken vagabond, if you say I\r\nadulterated my liquor more than other rum sellers.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Have a care, Peter, have a care, for did I not catch you in the\r\nvery act of pouring water by the pailfull into a rum hogshead last week,\r\nthat was only about half full of spurious alcohol, when you began to\r\nadulterate it?\r\n\r\n_Peter_—I was afraid the boys would drink so much, that they would not\r\nbe sober enough to whip my political enemies to-day, if I did not\r\nadulterate my pure and strong rum, which came from Jamaica only last\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—That will do, Peter—that will do, for you always could tell a\r\nsmoother and bigger lie than me, and I give it up.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Come, come, Jack—this won’t do. The sun will soon be climbing\r\nthe eastern hills, and there’s no time to be lost. What’s to be done?\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Fork over, Peter, and we’ll die, if necessary, in our effort to\r\nstuff the ballot boxes, and keep them stuffed all day, and drive your\r\nfoes from the polls, and seize the boxes at sunset, and count the votes\r\nin favor of your delegates to the Convention.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Will you be true?\r\n\r\n_Jack_—As money to the poor man.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Then awake the boys, and let them all come quickly, and get some\r\nstuff.\r\n\r\n_Jack_ (Scampers to the market)—Get up, you lazy drunken thieves, and\r\nrun for your lives to Peter Cooper’s, and get some precious stuff. (They\r\nall spring from the butcher stalls, and run like bloodhounds for Peter’s\r\ngroggery.)\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Here we are, Peter.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—So I perceive. (They all slyly smile and wink, and screw their\r\nexpressive mouths.)\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Shall I help the boys to some grog, Peter, while you are counting\r\nout our primary wages?\r\n\r\n_Peter_—O yes, but don’t give them too stiff a horn, Jack, as I fear\r\nthey will all get dead drunk before sundown, and then I’ll surely be\r\ndefeated, as the hardest fighting will be after the poles are closed.\r\nSo, boys, please drink moderately until the election is over, and fight\r\nlike bull dogs till the result is declared, and then, if I am the\r\nconqueror, you can all get drunk on my toddy for a week or month.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—That’s the talk. Them’s our views, an’t they, boys?\r\n\r\n_All_ (drinking)—Well—they are.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—There, Jack, there’s your share, and now you divide the balance\r\namong your honest and noble companions.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Boys—do you hear the compliments of our candidate?\r\n\r\n_All_—Well—we do, and he is a man of his word, and we’ll put him\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—(Putting all the money in his pocket)—Scissors! boys! Look down\r\nthe Bowery! There come, on the full jump, about forty bullies with Ned,\r\nthe murderer, at their head, screaming and beckoning his bloody gang to\r\nfollow him.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—O God! Stand by me, friends, or I’ll be murdered before the\r\npolls open. For Ned threatened to kill me yesterday, if I didn’t\r\nwithdraw my name as a candidate. So, don’t let him and his desperate\r\nband murder me. For I’m sure they will, if you abandon me. O dear! Do\r\nstand by me, brave young gentlemen! Won’t you? Please do? (He begins to\r\ncry.)\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Here they come, and they are armed with clubs, knives and\r\npistols.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—O Lordy! (And he crawls under the counter, and gets behind a rum\r\ncask, and is as quiet as a young rat.)\r\n\r\n_Ned_ (bursting through the door, and his cronies smashing the\r\nwindows)—I understand you stuffed the ballot-box last night for Peter\r\nCooper, and intend to carry the election to-day, by spurious ballots\r\nalready deposited.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—You are a liar. (They close, and Ned throws Jack, and mauls him\r\nawfully.)\r\n\r\n_Ned_—Go in, boys, and give no quarter, and drag Peter Cooper from\r\nbehind the rum cask, under the bar, and give him a dreadful flogging,\r\nfor not withdrawing in favor of my candidate.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—O spare me, Ned, spare me, and I’ll withdraw from the field.\r\n\r\n_Ned_—Shut up, Snarlyow. Give it to him, boys, and knock his teeth down\r\nhis throat, and make his nose as red as his crimes, and his eyes as\r\nblack as his heart. Hit him again, and avenge his robbery of his poor\r\nold Aunt.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—O spare me, kind gentlemen, and I’ll give you all the rum I’ve\r\ngot in the bar, and down cellar, too.\r\n\r\n_Ned_—Close your jaws, Shylock. Your time is come. (Jack now rallies,\r\nand a bloody collision ensues, and two are stabbed, and one shot, and\r\nPeter is terribly beaten, and thrown into the cellar, but soon crawls up\r\nstairs, and Peter’s friends fly for their lives.)\r\n\r\n_Peter_—(sitting on a rum cask, with his nostrils blocked with\r\ncoagulated blood, and his face mashed to a jelly, and Ned and his\r\nbullies drinking, laughing, singing, and dancing)—O dear me, I wish\r\nsomebody would come and relieve me from the clutches of these awful men.\r\n\r\n_Ned_—(throwing a glass of rum in the face of Peter)—No impudence,\r\nPeter. Another insolent word, and I’ll skin you. (The Police now rush\r\nin, and, after a bloody struggle, arrest Ned and all his followers, and\r\ndrag them to prison.)\r\n\r\n                           (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Stephen H.

Tiemann, and was published in all the\r\nnewspapers of that memorable period:\r\n\r\n  “TO THE VOTERS IN THIS HOUSE.\r\n\r\n  The inclosed Ticket is presented by the American Republican Party,\r\n  for your suffrage—it is composed exclusively of Americans who have\r\n  withdrawn from the great contending parties of the day, for the sake\r\n  of the country and its institutions; their character and standing in\r\n  the community is well known to be unexceptionable and highly\r\n  honorable; they have pledged themselves, if elected, to support and\r\n  carry out the principles of this party, which are as follows, viz:—\r\n\r\n  1st. We maintain that the Naturalization Laws should be so altered\r\n  as to require of all Foreigners who may hereafter arrive in this\r\n  Country, a residence of twenty-one years, before granting them the\r\n  privilege of the Elective Franchise; but at the same time, we\r\n  distinctly declare, that it is not our intention to interfere with\r\n  the vested rights of any citizen, or lay any obstruction in the way\r\n  of Foreigners obtaining a livlihood or acquiring property in this\r\n  country; but on the contrary, we would grant them the right to\r\n  purchase, hold and transfer property, and to enjoy and participate\r\n  in all the benefits of our country, (except that of voting and\r\n  holding office,) as soon as they declare their intentions to become\r\n  citizens.\r\n\r\n  2d. We advocate the repeal of the present Common School Law, and the\r\n  re-establishment of the Law, known as the Public School Law.\r\n\r\n  3d. We maintain that the Bible, without note or comment, is not\r\n  sectarian—that it is the fountain-head of morality and all good\r\n  government, and should be used in our Public Schools as a reading\r\n  Book.\r\n\r\n  4th. We are opposed to a union of Church and State in any and every\r\n  form.\r\n\r\n  5th. We hold that native Americans, only, should be appointed to\r\n  office, to legislate, administer, or execute the Laws of their own\r\n  country.\r\n\r\n  These are our principles—if you like them, we ask your support for\r\n  the enclosed Ticket. We believe the time has come when we may, with\r\n  truth, exclaim, “Delay is dangerous.” The above principles aim at\r\n  _existing evils_, which have grown to such enormity as to threaten\r\n  seriously our dearest and most sacred rights. We have waited long\r\n  and anxiously for some movement from among other parties to check\r\n  these evils, and we have waited in vain. The only hope that remains,\r\n  is for Americans to organize a new party, to combat and counteract\r\n  them. This we have done. The Presidential question we have nothing\r\n  to do with.—We invite you to our Standard: it is raised in the cause\r\n  of Civil and Religious Liberty, and no true American can fight\r\n  against it. It is the same Banner that was raised by Americans in\r\n  ’76.\r\n\r\n                                       DANIEL F. TIEMANN, _President_.\r\n\r\n    J. B. DENNIS, _Secretary_.\r\n    New York, November 1, 1843.”\r\n\r\nThis will do pretty well for a man whose father is a Holland Dutchman,\r\nand cannot now speak the American language so as to be easily\r\nunderstood,—who is appointing the ejected garroters of European\r\nCapitals, to the most lucrative and honorable positions, while poor and\r\nhonest and intelligent Americans (for whom he professed such boundless\r\nlove in 1843,) are haughtily denied the humblest appointments in his\r\ngift,—who has toiled with sleepless vigilance,—since his recent election\r\nas Mayor by the Americans,—to reinstate the odious George W. Matsell,\r\nand who has, after an arduous struggle, succeeded in effecting the\r\nreappointment of Captain Leonard, a Canadian, and of Captain Dowling, an\r\nIrishman, (both of whose naturalization papers I would like to see, or\r\nthe man who has seen them,) who were smuggled back to their old quarters\r\nby Cooper, Gerard, Tiemann, Bowen, and Stranaham, to cut the throat of\r\nSeward, and to diffuse poison through the Police Department, and to\r\nre-create the perjured carcase of Matsell on the ruins of Tallmadge and\r\nWm. Curtis Noyes, his noble son-in-law. Tiemann aspires to the honors of\r\na Governor, and himself and his brother Edward Cooper, (the Street\r\nCommissioner, and the own son of Peter Cooper,) are appointing all the\r\nruffians of both hemispheres to office, to effect the nomination and\r\nelection of Tiemann as Governor of the Empire State. But Peter, and\r\nDaniel, and Edward will be foiled. No man can attain the distinguished\r\nhonors of America, who prostitutes his own integrity and that of his\r\nfellow citizens, to effect his ungodly designs. Aaron Burr and other\r\nambitious rogues tried that experiment, and they were resisted and\r\nfoiled by the God who loves and protects our beloved America, and they\r\nwent down to ignominious graves, whose ashes will be loathed and\r\ntrampled by a thousand generations. Mayor Tiemann is a ninny and a\r\nhypocrite—has basely disowned his native Holland skies—has never been\r\nnaturalized—bamboozled the Americans in 1843 and 1857—loves neither\r\nAmerican nor foreigner, nor his God—but adores himself and Peter Cooper,\r\nand fears George W. Matsell and his Matron Mistress on Randall’s Island,\r\nwhom he forced and nearly strangled, while he committed a deed of hell,\r\nin the violation of her person, for which, in any city of Europe, he\r\nwould be dragged to a dungeon or the block, and perhaps torn to pieces\r\nin the market place, by the indignant and phrensied populace.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Editorial Career of James Gordon Bennett.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOHN KELLY’S HOME.\r\n\r\n                         _Enter John in tears._\r\n\r\n_John’s Mother_—Well, dear Johnny, why do you cry so hard?

Speak, my darling boy, and speak\r\nquickly, so that your dear mother can sympathise with you.\r\n\r\n_John_—(still crying)—Dear mother, my heart is so full of woe, that I\r\ncannot speak.\r\n\r\n_Mother_—(begins to cry)—O, God! I fear something awful has happened to\r\nmy adored son, and that he is injured internally, and will soon die.\r\n(Falls on her knees, and clasps her hands, and wails in piteous tones,\r\nand implores God to spare her son.)\r\n\r\n_John_—(seizing her)—Don’t cry, dear mother, my heart, not my form, is\r\nbruised.\r\n\r\n_Mother_—And who bruised your big heart? Did a ruffian throw a stone, or\r\nkick you, or strike your heart with his fist? O tell me quickly, so that\r\nI can fell him to the earth.\r\n\r\n_John_—Neither, good mother, neither. I spoke figuratively, when I said\r\nmy heart was bruised.\r\n\r\n_Mother_—And an’t figures facts? How strangely you talk, dear Johnny.\r\nDid not your old mother go to school, and did she not cipher as far as\r\nDistraction? And when you say your poor heart is bruised figuratively,\r\nyou talk from the Rule of Distraction, don’t you? Mr. Daboll used to say\r\nso, before you was born. Go to, my son, go to, for your old mother is\r\nnot so far distracted as not to understand figures as far as\r\nDistraction.\r\n\r\n_Father_ (just emerging from a profound nap)—What is all this row about?\r\n\r\n_Mother_—Some rowdy has bruised Johnny’s heart.\r\n\r\n_Father_—Where is my hat? I’ll pursue the rascal.\r\n\r\n_John_—Hold, father, hold, and you, mother, please calm your nerves, and\r\nlisten to my brief but plaintive story.\r\n\r\n_Father_—Go on, dear son.\r\n\r\n_Mother_—And we will judge impartially.\r\n\r\n_John_—I have left Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n_Mother_—Good Lord! For what?\r\n\r\n_John_—Because he wanted me to tell lies.\r\n\r\n_Mother_—(falling)—O God! O God! We are hungry and nearly naked, and may\r\nsoon be houseless, but thou hast blessed us with an honest boy, which is\r\na far more precious boon than food and raiment and shelter. (And she\r\nutters a long and fervent and grateful prayer to God, for the unwavering\r\nintegrity of her beloved son, while Johnny and his father weep aloud on\r\ntheir bended knees.)\r\n\r\n_Father_ (the distracted mother still prostrate on the floor)—John: Did\r\nMr. Bennett pay you what he owed you?\r\n\r\n_John_—He offered to, but I would not take it.\r\n\r\n_Father_—Why?\r\n\r\n_John_—Because I thought he got it dishonestly, as he wanted me to tell\r\nlies.\r\n\r\n_Father_—My landlord was here to-day, and I told him I expected some\r\nmoney from Mr. Bennett for your services, and he will be here this\r\nevening, for his rent, and I fear he will turn us into the street, when\r\nI tell him that I cannot pay him.\r\n\r\n_John_—I am very sorry, father, that you will be cast into the street,\r\non my account. (The father weeps, and the mother springs to her feet,\r\nand kisses Johnny, and swears that if the landlord attempts to drive\r\nthem into the open air, she will dash his brains out.)\r\n\r\n_John_ (putting on his hat, and with one hand on the latch)—Don’t cry,\r\ndear father and mother, nor be excited and unhappy in my brief absence.\r\n\r\n_Mother_—Where are you going, Johnny?\r\n\r\n_John_—I am going round to the fire engine house, to see a noble young\r\nfireman, who is a warm friend of mine, and whose father is very rich,\r\nand I am sure he will cry when I tell him that my poor old father and\r\nmother are sick and hungry, and are about to be thrust into the street.\r\n\r\n_Mother_ (on the verge of despair)—Tell him our mournful story, Johnny,\r\nbut do not beg. No, my Johnny, for God’s sake, don’t beg. Let us all die\r\nbefore we implore alms. Your mother is too proud to have her son descend\r\nto that. Don’t beg, Johnny, don’t beg, I implore you. It is my last\r\nprayer to my dear son.\r\n\r\n_John_—I could not beg, mother. I would die before I would thus degrade\r\nmyself and noble parents, who have seen fairer days than these. Besides,\r\nmy friend is humane, and so are his parents, and I am sure I will not\r\nhave to beg him to relieve us. It will be sufficient for him to learn of\r\nour destitution, and that we became utterly poor, because I would not\r\ntell lies for James Gordon Bennett.\r\n\r\n_Father_—Go, my son, to your young fireman friend, and tell your story\r\nin your own way. I’m sure you will never degrade your father and mother,\r\nafter your refusal to lie for Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n_Mother_—Go, Johnny, and soon return to your distracted parents, and let\r\nthem know their fate.\r\n\r\n_John_ (kissing his mother, and warmly pressing his father’s hand)—Good\r\nbye, father and mother, and I’ll soon bring you pleasing news, and a\r\ndeliverance from abject penury. (He goes.)\r\n\r\n                       _Evening—Enter Landlord._\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—Well, Mr. Kelly, have you got my rent?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Kelly_—No, sir. My son has left Mr. Bennett, because he wanted him\r\nto tell lies.\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—For what?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Kelly_—Because he wanted him to lie.\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—What a fool your son must be.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Kelly_—Don’t you call my son a fool, sir. God loved George\r\nWashington because he would not lie, and made him the Liberator of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—That’s all gammon. Washington was an old Federalist, and an\r\nold knave and fool, and could swear and lie as hard as a delinquent\r\ntenant.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Kelly_ (throws the tea pot, full of scalding water, at his\r\nhead)—Take that, you miserable old tory and miser. (The landlord rushes\r\nupon Mrs. Kelly, when Mr. Kelly, forgetting his rheumatic leg, flies at\r\nhim like a tiger, and while they grapple, and level their deadly blows,\r\nwith Mrs. Kelly pouring hot water down the neck and back of the\r\nlandlord—in comes John, and his young fireman friend, who both seize the\r\nlandlord, and hurl him down stairs, and kick him into the street, amid\r\nthe frantic yells of all the neighbors. John then introduces the young\r\nNew York Fireman to his father and mother, who receive him with courtesy\r\nand fervor.)\r\n\r\n                           (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Fools.\r\n\r\n\r\nBennett and Hudson (through their influence with the wholesale news\r\ndealers,) supposed they could check the circulation of the “ALLIGATOR,”\r\namong the honest masses, who have been kicked and cuffed and sold by the\r\nBennett’s, and Greeley’s, and Raymond’s, since the immortal Pudding\r\nDinner of Benjamin Franklin, to the wicked aristocracy and tories of\r\nPhiladelphia, who threatened to crush Franklin’s bold and independent\r\nJournal, but who got egregiously mistaken.
