S. Hildesheimer & Co., Ltd._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThis short account of the rise of political democracy is necessarily but an\r\noutline of the matter, and while it is not easy to define the exact limits,\r\nthere is no difficulty in noting omissions. For instance, there is scarcely\r\nany reference to the work of poets or pamphleteers. John Ball's rhyming\r\nletters are quoted, but not the poems of Langland, and the political songs\r\nof the Middle Ages are hardly mentioned. The host of political pamphleteers\r\nin the seventeenth century are excluded, with the exception of Lilburne and\r\nWinstanley, whose work deserves better treatment from posterity than it\r\nreceived from contemporaries. Defoe's vigorous services for the Whigs are\r\nunnoticed, and the democratic note in much of the poetry of Burns, Blake,\r\nByron and Shelley is left unconsidered, and the influence of these poets\r\nundiscussed. The anti-Corn Law rhymes of Ebenezer Eliot, and the Chartist\r\nsongs of Ernest Jones were notable inspirations in their day, and in our\r\nown times Walt Whitman and Mr. Edward Carpenter have been the chief singers\r\nof democracy. But a whole volume at least might be written on the part the\r\npen has played in the struggle towards democracy.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is no mention of Ireland in this short sketch. A Nationalist\r\nmovement is not necessarily a democratic movement, and the Irish\r\nNationalist Party includes men of very various political opinions, whose\r\nsingle point of agreement is the demand for Home Rule. In India and Egypt\r\nthe agitation is for representative institutions. Ireland might, or might\r\nnot, become a democracy under Home Rule--who can say?\r\n\r\nThe aim of the present writer has been to trace the travelled road of the\r\nEnglish people towards democracy, and to point out certain landmarks on\r\nthat road, in the hope that readers may be turned to examine more closely\r\nfor themselves the journey taken. For the long march teems with adventure\r\nand spirited enterprise; and, noting mistakes and failures in the past, we\r\nmay surely and wisely, and yet with greater daring and finer courage,\r\npursue the road, not unmindful of the charge committed to us in the\r\ncenturies left behind.\r\n\r\n  J.C.\r\n\r\n  HAMPSTEAD,\r\n  _September, 1911._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe British Influence--\"Government of the People, by the People, for the\r\nPeople\"--The Foundations of Democracy--British Democracy Experimental not\r\nDoctrinaire--Education to Democracy\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY STRUGGLES AGAINST THE ABSOLUTISM OF THE CROWN\r\n\r\nThe Great Churchmen--Archbishop Anselm and Norman Autocracy--Thomas à\r\nBecket and Henry II.--Stephen Langton and John--The Great Charter\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nDemocracy and Representative Government--Representative Theory First found\r\nin Ecclesiastical Assemblies--The Misrule of Henry III.--Simon of Montfort,\r\nLeader of the National Party--Edward I.'s Model Parliament, 1295--The\r\nNobility Predominant in Parliament--The Medieval National Assemblies--The\r\nElectors of the Middle Ages--Payment of Parliamentary Representatives--The\r\nPolitical Position of Women in the Middle Ages--No Theory of Democracy in\r\nthe Middle Ages\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPOPULAR INSURRECTION IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nGeneral Results of Popular Risings--William FitzOsbert, 1196--The Peasant\r\nRevolt and its Leaders, 1381--Jack Cade, Captain of Kent, 1450--The Norfolk\r\nRising under Ket, 1549\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE RENEWED AGAINST THE CROWN\r\n\r\nParliament under the Tudors--Victory of Parliament over the Stuarts--The\r\nDemocratic Protest: Lilburne--Winstanley and \"The Diggers\"--The Restoration\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT--ARISTOCRACY TRIUMPHANT\r\n\r\nGovernment by Aristocrats--Civil and Religious Liberty--Growth of Cabinet\r\nRule--Walpole's rule--The Change in the House of Lords--\"Wilkes and\r\nLiberty\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC IDEA\r\n\r\nThe Witness of the Middle Ages--The \"Social Contract\" Theory--Thomas\r\nHobbes--John Locke--Rousseau and French Revolution--American\r\nIndependence--Thomas Paine--Major Cartwright and the \"Radical\r\nReformers\"--Thomas Spence--Practical Politics and Democratic Ideals\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY REFORM AND THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Revolution--The Need for Parliamentary Reform--Manufacturing\r\nCentres Unrepresented in Parliament--The Passage of the Great Reform\r\nBill--The Working Class still Unrepresented--Chartism--The Hyde Park\r\nRailings, 1866--Household Suffrage--Working-class Representation in\r\nParliament--Removal of Religious Disabilities: Catholics, Jews and\r\nFreethinkers--The Enfranchisement of Women\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY AT WORK\r\n\r\nLocal Government--The Workman in the House of Commons--Working-class\r\nLeaders in Parliament--The Present Position of the House of Lords--The\r\nPopularity of the Crown--The Democratic Ideals: Socialism and Social\r\nReform--Land Reform and the Single Tax\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD-WIDE MOVEMENT: ITS STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS\r\n\r\nEast and West--Tyranny under Democratic Forms--The Obvious Dangers--Party\r\nGovernment--Bureaucracy--Working-Class Ascendancy--On Behalf of Democracy\r\n\r\nLIST OF PLATES\r\n\r\n  KING JOHN GRANTING MAGNA CHARTA\r\n\r\n  MAGNA CHARTA--A FACSIMILE OF THE ORIGINAL IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM\r\n\r\n  SIR JOHN ELIOT\r\n\r\n  JOHN HAMPDEN\r\n\r\n  THE GORDON RIOTS\r\n\r\n  THE RIGHT HON.

Mainly through British influences the\r\nmovement has become world wide; and the desire for national\r\nself-government, and the adoption of the political instruments of\r\ndemocracy--popular enfranchisement and the rule of elected\r\nrepresentatives--are still the aspirations of civilised man in East and\r\nWest. The knowledge that these forms of democratic government have by no\r\nmeans at all times and in all places proved successful does not check the\r\nmovement. As the British Parliament and the British Constitution have in\r\nthe past been accepted as a model in countries seeking free political\r\ninstitutions, so to-day our Parliament and our Constitutional Government\r\nare still quoted with approval and admiration in those lands where these\r\ninstitutions are yet to be tried.\r\n\r\nThe rise of democracy, then, is a matter in which Britain is largely\r\nconcerned; and this in spite of the fact that in England little respect and\r\nless attention has been paid to the expounders of democracy and their\r\nconstructive theories of popular government. The notion that philosophers\r\nare the right persons to manage affairs of state and hold the reins of\r\nGovernment has always been repugnant to the English people, and, with us,\r\nto call a man \"a political theorist\" is to contemn him. The English have\r\nnot moved towards democracy with any conscious desire for that particular\r\nform of government, and no vision of a perfect State or an ideal\r\ncommonwealth has sustained them on the march. Our boast has been that we\r\nare a \"practical\" people, and so our politics are, as they ever have been,\r\nexperimental. Reforms have been accomplished not out of deference to some\r\nmoral or political principle, but because the abuse to be remedied had\r\nbecome intolerable. Dissatisfaction with the Government and the conviction\r\nthat only by enfranchisement and the free election of representatives can\r\nParliament remove the grounds of dissatisfaction, have carried us towards\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nWe have been brought to accept Abraham Lincoln's famous phrase, \"Government\r\nof the people, by the people, for the people,\" as a definition of\r\ndemocracy; but in that acceptance there is no harking back to the early\r\ndemocracies of Greece or Rome, so beloved by the French democrats of the\r\neighteenth century, who, however, knew very little about those ancient\r\nstates--or any vain notion of restoring primitive Teutonic democracy.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign assemblies of Greece--the Ecclesia of Athens, and the Apella\r\nof Sparta--the Comitia Centuriata of Rome, have no more resemblance to\r\ndemocracy in the twentieth century than the Witenagemot has to the British\r\nParliament; and the democracy which has arisen in modern times is neither\r\nto be traced for its origin to Greece or Rome, nor found to be evolved from\r\nAnglo-Saxon times. The early democracies of Athens and Sparta were confined\r\nto small states, and were based on a slave population without civic rights.\r\nThere was not even a conception that slaves might or should take part in\r\npolitics, and the slaves vastly outnumbered the citizens. Modern democracy\r\ndoes not tolerate slavery, it will not admit the permanent exclusion of any\r\nbody of people from enfranchisement; though it finds it hard to ignore\r\ndifferences of race and colour, it is always enlarging the borders of\r\ncitizenship. So that already in the Australian Commonwealth, in New\r\nZealand, in certain of the American States, in Norway, and in Finland, we\r\nhave the complete enfranchisement of all men and women who are of age to\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nApart from this vital difference between a slave-holding democracy and a\r\ndemocracy of free citizens--a difference that rent the United States in\r\ncivil war, and was only settled in America by democracy ending\r\nslavery--ancient democracy was government by popular assembly, and modern\r\ndemocracy is government through elected representatives. The former is only\r\npossible in small communities with very limited responsibilities--a parish\r\nmeeting can decide questions of no more than strictly local interest; for\r\nour huge empires of to-day nothing better than representative government\r\nhas been devised for carrying out the general will of the majority.\r\n\r\nAs for the early English Witenagemot, it was simply an assembly of the\r\nchiefs, and, though crowds sometimes attended, all but the great men were\r\nthe merest spectators. Doubtless the folk-moot of the tribe was democratic,\r\nfor all free men attended it, and the English were a nation of freeholders,\r\nand the slaves were few--except in the west--and might become free men.[1]\r\nThe shire-moot, too, with its delegates from the hundred-moots, was equally\r\ndemocratic. But with feudalism and the welding of the nation, tribal\r\ndemocracies passed away, leaving, however, in many places a valuable\r\ntradition of local self-government.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATIONS OF DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nA steady and invincible belief that those who maintain the defence of the\r\ncountry and pay for the cost of government should have a voice in the great\r\ncouncil of the nation, and the conviction that effective utterance can be\r\nfound for that voice in duly chosen representatives, are the foundations on\r\nwhich democracy has built. Democracy itself comes in (1) when it is seen\r\nthat all are being taxed for national purposes; and (2) the opinion finds\r\nacceptance that responsibilities of citizenship should be borne by all who\r\nhave reached the age of manhood and are of sound mind.\r\n\r\nTo sketch the rise of democracy in England is to trace the steady\r\nresistance to kings who would govern without the advice of counsellors, and\r\nto note the growing determination that these counsellors must be elected\r\nrepresentatives. Only when the absolutism of the Crown is ended and a\r\nParliament of elected members has become the real centre of government, is\r\nit possible, without a revolution, for democracy to be established.\r\n\r\nMuch of this book is given up, then, to the old stories of kingly rule\r\nchecked and slowly superseded by aristocracy. And all the old attempts at\r\nrevolution by popular insurrection are again retold, not only because of\r\nthe witness they bear to the impossibility in England of achieving\r\ndemocracy by the violent overthrow of government, but because they also\r\nbear witness to the heroic resolution of the English people to take up arms\r\nand plunge into a sea of troubles rather than bear patiently ills that were\r\nunseemly for men to endure in silence. Popular insurrection failed, but\r\nover and over again violence has been resorted to in the resistance to\r\ntyranny, and has been justified by its victory. If Wat Tyler, Jack Cade,\r\nand Robert Ket are known as beaten revolutionaries, Stephen Langton, Simon\r\nof Montfort, and John Hampden are acclaimed as patriots for not disdaining\r\nthe use of armed resistance.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that a democratic revolution was not to be accomplished\r\nin England by a rising of the people, but that forcible resistance even to\r\nthe point of civil war was necessary to guard liberties already won, or to\r\nsave the land from gross misgovernment. But always the forcible resistance,\r\nwhen successful, has been made not by revolutionaries but by the strong\r\nchampions of constitutional government. The fruit of the resistance to John\r\nwas the Great Charter; of Simon of Montfort's war against Henry III., the\r\nbeginning of a representative Parliament; of the war against Charles, the\r\nestablishment of Parliamentary government. Lilburne and his friends hoped\r\nthat the civil war and the abolition of monarchy would bring in democracy,\r\nthough democracy was never in the mind of men like Hampden, who made the\r\nwar, and was utterly uncongenial to Cromwell and the Commonwealth men. But\r\nthe sanctity of monarchy received its death-blow from Cromwell, and\r\nperished with the deposing of James II.; and there has been no\r\nresurrection. To the Whig rule we owe the transference of political power\r\nfrom the Crown to Parliament. Once it is manifest that Parliament is the\r\ninstrument of authority, that the Prime Minister and his colleagues rule\r\nonly by the permission and with the approval of the House of Commons, and\r\nthat the House of Commons itself is chosen by a certain number of electors\r\nto represent the nation, then it is plain that the real sovereignty is in\r\nthe electors who choose the House of Commons. As long as the electors are\r\nfew and consist of the great landowners and their satellites, then the\r\nconstitutional government is aristocracy, and democracy is still to come.\r\n\r\nAnd just as discontent with monarchy, and its obvious failure as a\r\nsatisfactory form of government, brought in aristocracy, so at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century discontent with aristocracy was rife,\r\nand a new industrial middle-class looked for \"Parliamentary reform,\" to\r\nimprove the condition of England.\r\n\r\nBRITISH DEMOCRACY EXPERIMENTAL, NOT DOCTRINAIRE\r\n\r\nResistance to royal absolutism, culminating in the acknowledged ascendancy\r\nof Parliament and the triumphant aristocracy of 1688, was never based on\r\nabstract principles of the rights of barons and landowners, but sprang from\r\nthe positive, definite conviction that those who furnished arms and men for\r\nthe king, or who paid certain moneys in taxation, were entitled to be heard\r\nin the councils of the king; and the charters given in the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries--from Henry I. to Henry III.--confirmed this\r\nconviction. The resistance to the Stuarts was still based on the conviction\r\nthat direct taxation conferred political privileges, but now the claim to\r\nspeak in the great council of the realm had become a request to be listened\r\nto by the king, and passed rapidly from that to a resolution that the king\r\nshould have no money from Parliament if he refused to listen. The practical\r\ninconvenience of a king altogether at variance with Parliament was held to\r\nbe sufficient justification for getting rid of James II., and for hobbling\r\nall future kings with the Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nThe dethronement of aristocracy in favour of democracy has proceeded on\r\nvery similar lines. The mass of English people were far too wretched and\r\nfar too ignorant at the end of the eighteenth century to care anything\r\nabout abstract \"rights of man,\" and only political philosophers and a few\r\nartisans hoped for improvement in their condition by Parliamentary reform.\r\nAgricultural England accepted the rule of landowners as an arrangement by\r\nprovidence. It was the industrial revolution that shattered the feudal\r\nnotions of society, and created a manufacturing population which knew\r\nnothing of lowly submission to pastors and masters. A middle-class emerged\r\nfrom the very ranks of the working people. The factory system brought\r\nfortunes to men who a few years earlier had been artisans, and to these new\r\ncapitalists in the nineteenth century the aristocracy in power was as\r\nirksome as the Stuarts had been to the Whigs. If, as the Whigs taught,\r\nthose who paid the taxes were entitled to a voice in the government, then\r\nthe manufacturing districts ought to send representatives to Parliament. It\r\nseemed monstrous that places like Manchester, Leeds, and Birmingham had no\r\none in the House of Commons to plead for the needs of their inhabitants.\r\nThe manufacturer wanted Parliamentary representation because he hoped\r\nthrough Parliament to secure the abolition of the political disabilities of\r\nNonconformists, and to get financial changes made that would make the\r\nconditions of trade more profitable. And he felt that it would be better\r\nfor the country if he and the class he represented could speak freely in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe workman wanted the vote because he had been brought to believe that,\r\npossessing the vote, he could make Parliament enact laws that would lighten\r\nthe hardships of his life. The whole of the manufacturing class--capitalist\r\nand workman alike--could see by 1820 that the House of Commons was the\r\ninstrument of the electorate, and that to get power they must become\r\nelectors. (Yet probably not one per cent. of them could express clearly any\r\ntheory of popular sovereignty.) The old Whig families, kept out of office\r\nby the Tories whom George III. had placed in power, and who now controlled\r\nthe House of Commons, supported reform and the enfranchisement of the\r\nmiddle class because they saw no way of getting back into power except by a\r\nnew electorate and a redistribution of Parliamentary seats. At the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century the landowner, still Whig, though now,\r\nas a general rule enrolled with the Unionist Party, has not been excluded\r\nfrom political power, but the representatives of the middle-class and of\r\nthe working people are predominant in the House of Commons. The claim of\r\nthe House of Lords to reject the bills of the Commons has been, in our\r\ntime, subjected to the criticism formerly extended to the royal\r\nprerogative, and an Act--the Parliament Act--has now been passed which\r\nformally requires the Lords to accept, without serious amendment, every\r\nBill sent up from the Commons in three successive sessions.\r\n\r\nThe transition from monarchy to aristocracy in England was brought about at\r\nthe price of civil war. In many countries democracy has been born in\r\nrevolution, and the birth pains have been hard and bitter. But in England\r\nin the nineteenth century democracy was allowed to come into being by\r\npermission of the aristocracy, and has not yet reached its full stature. It\r\nis true that violence, bloodshed, loss of life, and destruction of property\r\nmarked the passage of the great Reform Bill; that more than once riots and\r\ndefiance of law and order have been the expression of industrial\r\ndiscontent; but on the whole the average Englishman is content to wait for\r\nthe redress of wrongs by Parliamentary action. Women have quite recently\r\ndefied the law, refused to pay taxes, and made use of \"militant methods\" in\r\ntheir agitation for enfranchisement. But the women's plea has been that, as\r\nthey are voteless, these methods have been necessary to call attention to\r\ntheir demands. Democratic advance has often been hindered and delayed by\r\ngovernment, and by a national disinclination from rapid political change;\r\nbut as the character of government has changed with the changed character\r\nof the electorate and the House of Commons, so resistance to democracy has\r\nalways been abandoned when the advance was widely supported, and further\r\ndelay seemed dangerous to the public order.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords is thus seen to yield to the popular representatives in\r\nthe House of Commons, and the government, dependent on the House of\r\nCommons, to listen to the demand of women for enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nWhile the House of Commons completes its assertion of political supremacy,\r\nand insists on the absolute responsibility of the chosen representatives of\r\nthe electorate, the agitation for the enfranchisement of women is the\r\nreminder that democracy has yet to widen its borders. Progress to democracy\r\nin the last one hundred years is visible not only in the enlarged number of\r\nenfranchised citizens, but in the general admission that every extension of\r\nthe franchise has been to the public good; not only in the fact that men of\r\nall classes and trades now have their representatives in Parliament, but in\r\nthe very wide acknowledgment that women without votes cannot get that\r\nattention by members of the House of Commons that is given to male\r\nelectors. That the majority of electors have expressed a decided opinion\r\nthat the power of the House of Lords should be curtailed, as the power of\r\nthe monarchy has been curtailed, and that the decisions of the House of\r\nCommons are only to be corrected by the House of Commons, is evidence that\r\nunder our obviously imperfect Parliamentary system the will of the electors\r\ndoes get registered on the Statute Book.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION TO DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nApart from the direct political education to democracy, it is well to note\r\nthe other agencies that have been at work, preparing men and women for the\r\nresponsible task of national self-government.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the religious guilds and the trade guilds, managed by\r\ntheir own members, gave men and women a training in democratic government.\r\nThe parish, too, was a commune, and its affairs and finances were\r\nadministered by duly elected officers.[2]\r\n\r\nBut the guilds, with their numerous almshouses and hospitals, were all\r\nsuppressed early in Edward VI.'s reign, and their funds confiscated. As for\r\nthe parish, it was shorn of all its property, save the parish church, in\r\nthe same reign, and its old self-governing life dwindled away to the\r\nelection of churchwardens.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the beginning of the nineteenth century that the working\r\nclasses, by the formation of trade unions, once more took up the task of\r\neducation in self-government. From that time onward, through trade unions,\r\nco-operative societies, and friendly societies, with their annual\r\nconferences and congresses, a steady training in democracy has been\r\nachieved; and our Labour Party of to-day, with its Members of Parliament,\r\nits members of county and district councils, and its Justices of the Peace,\r\nwould hardly have been possible but for this training. Other agencies may\r\nbe mentioned. The temperance movement, the organisation of working-men's\r\nclubs, and the local preaching of the Nonconformist Churches--particularly\r\nthe Primitive Methodist denomination--have all helped to educate workmen in\r\nthe conduct of affairs, and to create that sense of personal responsibility\r\nwhich is the only guarantee of an honest democracy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY STRUGGLES AGAINST THE ABSOLUTISM OF THE CROWN\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT CHURCHMEN\r\n\r\nWe are far from any thoughts of democracy in the early struggles against\r\nthe absolutism of the Crown. The old love of personal liberty that is said\r\nto have characterised the Anglo-Saxon had no political outlet under Norman\r\nfeudalism. What we note is that three Archbishops of Canterbury were strong\r\nenough and brave enough to stand up against the unchecked rule of kings,\r\nand the names of these great Archbishops--Anselm, Thomas à Becket, and\r\nStephen Langton--are to be honoured for all time for the services they\r\nrendered in the making of English liberties. Not one of the three was in\r\nany sense a democrat. It is not till the latter part of the fourteenth\r\ncentury that we find John Ball, a wandering, revolutionary priest, uttering\r\nfor the first time in England a democratic doctrine. Anselm, Becket, and\r\nLangton did their work, as Simon of Montfort, and as Eliot and Hampden\r\nworked later, not for the sake of a democracy, but for the restriction of\r\nan intolerable autocracy. All along in English history liberties have been\r\ngained and enlarged by this process of restriction, and it was only when\r\nthe powers of the Crown had been made subject to Parliament that it was\r\npossible, at the close of the nineteenth century, for Parliament itself to\r\nbecome converted from an assembly of aristocrats to a governing body that\r\nreally represented the nation.\r\n\r\nBut in considering the rise of democracy we can no more omit the early\r\nstruggles against the absolutism of the Crown than we can pass over Simon\r\nof Montfort's Parliament, or the unsuccessful popular revolts, or the war\r\nwith Charles I., or the Whig revolution of 1688. They are all incidents of\r\npre-democratic days, but they are all events of significance. Democracy is\r\nno new order of society, conceived in the fertile mind of man; it has been\r\nslowly evolved and brought to birth after centuries of struggle, to be\r\ntried as a form of government only when other forms are outgrown, and cease\r\nto be acceptable.\r\n\r\nAll the great men--heroic and faulty--who withstood the tyranny of their\r\nday, not only wrested charters from kings, they left a tradition of\r\nresistance; and this tradition has been of incalculable service to a nation\r\nseeking self-government. It is easy to dismiss the work of Anselm and\r\nBecket as mere disputes between monarch and Churchman, to treat lightly the\r\nbattle for the Great Charter as a strife between king and barons. Just as\r\neasy is it to regard the Peasant Revolt of the fourteenth century and Jack\r\nCade's rebellion in the fifteenth century as the tumults of a riotous mob.\r\nThe great point is to see clearly in all these contests, successful and\r\nunsuccessful, the movement for liberty, for greater security and expansion\r\nof life in England, and to note that only by a stern endurance and a\r\nwillingness not to bear an irksome oppression have our liberties been won.\r\nIn the winning of these liberties we have proved our fitness for democracy,\r\nfor a government that will allow the fullest measure of self-development.\r\n\r\nNow, what was it that Anselm contended for, first with William II. and then\r\nwith Henry I.?\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOP ANSELM AND NORMAN AUTOCRACY\r\n\r\nAnselm was sixty when, in 1093, William II. named him for the Archbishopric\r\nof Canterbury. In vain Anselm, who was Abbot of the famous monastery of\r\nBec, in Normandy, protested that he was too old, and that his business was\r\nnot with high place and power in this world. The King seemed to be dying,\r\nand the bishops gathered round the sick bed would not hear of any refusal\r\non Anselm's part. They pushed the pastoral staff into his hands, and\r\ncarried him off to a neighbouring church, while the people shouted \"Long\r\nlive the bishop!\"\r\n\r\nWhat everybody felt was that with Anselm as Archbishop things might be\r\nbetter in England, for Anselm's reputation stood very high. He had been the\r\nfriend of Lanfranc, the late Archbishop; he had been an honoured guest at\r\nthe Court of William the Conqueror; and he was known for his deep learning,\r\nhis sanctity of life, and simple, disinterested devotion to duty. It was\r\nhoped that with a man of such holiness at Canterbury some restraint might\r\nbe placed on the lawless tyranny of the Red King. Lanfranc had been the\r\ntrusted counsellor and right hand of the Red King's father: why should not\r\nAnselm bring back the son to the paths of decency--at least? The Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury was the chief man in the realm next to the king, and for\r\nthree years since Lanfranc's death the see had been kept vacant that\r\nWilliam Rufus might enjoy its revenues for his own pleasure. It was not\r\nunreasonable that men should look to the appointment of Anselm as the\r\nbeginning of an amendment in Church and State. The trouble was that William\r\nstuck to his evil courses.\r\n\r\nThe rule of William the Conqueror had been stern and harsh, and his hand\r\nhad been heavy on the English people. But there had been law and justice in\r\nthe rule; religion and morality had been respected, and peace and security\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe rule of the Red King was not only grievous, it was arbitrary,\r\ncapricious, cruel, and without semblance of law. The austerity of the\r\nConqueror had been conspicuous; equally conspicuous was the debauchery of\r\nhis son. The Conqueror had been faithful and conscientious in seeing that\r\nvacancies in the Church were filled up quickly and wisely. The Red King\r\npreferred to leave bishoprics and churches empty so that he might annex the\r\nprofits. Lanfranc, a wise and just man, had been the Minister of the\r\nConqueror; the Red King made Ranulf (nicknamed the Torch or Firebrand)--a\r\nclever, unprincipled clerk--Bishop of Durham and Justiciar. It was Ranulf\r\nwho did the King's business in keeping churches and bishoprics vacant, in\r\nviolation of law and custom; it was Ranulf who plundered the King's vassals\r\nand the people at large by every kind of extortion, thwarted the protests\r\nof Anselm, and encouraged William in his savage profligacies.\r\n\r\nMeek and gentle as Anselm was, he had all the courage that comes of a lofty\r\nsense of responsibility to God, and he stood before kings as the Hebrew\r\nprophets of old had stood, calm and fearless. At Christmas, 1092, three\r\nmonths before his nomination to the See of Canterbury, Anselm was in\r\nEngland over the affairs of his monastery, and William invited him to Court\r\nand treated him with great display of honour. Then some private talk took\r\nplace between the two, and Anselm said plainly that \"Things were spoken\r\ndaily of the King, openly or secretly, by nearly all the men of his realm,\r\nwhich were not seemly for the King's dignity.\" From that time Anselm stayed\r\nin England, for William refused to give him leave to return to Normandy.\r\n\r\nThen in March, 1093 came the King's sickness, which most men expected to be\r\nmortal. Anselm was summoned, and on his arrival bade the King \"make a clean\r\nconfession of all that he knows that he has done against God, and promise\r\nthat, should he recover, he will without pretence amend in all things. The\r\nKing at once agreed to this, and with sorrow of heart engaged to do all\r\nthat Anselm required and to keep justice and mercy all his life long. To\r\nthis he pledged his faith, and made his bishops witness between himself and\r\nGod, sending persons in his stead to promise his word to God on the altar.\r\nAn edict was written and sealed with the King's seal that all prisoners\r\nshould be set free in all his dominions, all debts forgiven, all offences\r\nheretofore committed pardoned and forgotten for ever. Further, good and\r\nholy laws were promised to the whole people, and the sacred upholding of\r\nright and such solemn inquest into wrongdoing as may deter others.\"[3]\r\n\r\nWilliam did not die, and his repentance was short-lived; but the one act of\r\ngrace he did before leaving his sick bed was to fill up the empty throne at\r\nCanterbury by the appointment of Anselm--Anselm's protests of unfitness\r\nnotwithstanding. Then, on the King's recovery, as though to make up for the\r\npenitence displayed, all the royal promises of amendment were broken\r\nwithout shame, and \"all the evil which the King had wrought before he was\r\nsick seemed good by the side of the wrong which he did when he was returned\r\nto health.\" The prisoners who had been pardoned were sent back to prison,\r\nthe debts which had been cancelled were re-claimed, and all legal actions\r\nwhich had been dropped were resumed. Anselm was now enthroned at\r\nCanterbury, and his appointment could not be revoked; but the King was\r\nquick to show his displeasure at the new Archbishop.\r\n\r\nThe first point raised by William was that those lands belonging to the See\r\nof Canterbury, which had been made over to military vassals of the Crown\r\nwhile the archbishopric was vacant, should remain with their holders.\r\nAnselm said at once that this was impossible. He was responsible for the\r\nadministration of all the estates of Canterbury, and to allow these lands\r\nto be alienated to the Crown was to rob the poor and needy who, it was\r\nheld, had a just claim on the property of the Church. Besides, Anselm saw\r\nthat the lands would never be restored once an Archbishop confirmed their\r\nappropriation by the King's military tenants. There was no one in all\r\nEngland save Anselm who dared withstand the Crown, and had he yielded on\r\nthis matter resistance to the tyranny of the Red King would only have been\r\nharder on the next occasion.\r\n\r\nThen came the question of a present of money to the King, the customary\r\noffering. Anselm brought five hundred marks (£333), a very considerable sum\r\nin those days, and William, persuaded by some of his courtiers that twice\r\nthe amount ought to have been given, curtly declined the present. Anselm,\r\nwho disliked the whole business of these gifts to the Crown, for he knew\r\nthat many a Churchman bought his office by promising a \"free\" gift after\r\ninstitution, solemnly warned William that money given freely as his was\r\ngiven was better than a forced tribute, and to this William answered that\r\nhe wanted neither the Archbishop's money nor his preaching or company.\r\n\r\nThereupon Anselm retired and gave the money to the poor, determined that\r\nhe, for his part, would make no attempt to purchase William's goodwill.\r\nHenceforth William was equally determined that Anselm should have no peace\r\nin England. It was hateful to the King that there should be anyone in the\r\nrealm who acknowledged a higher authority than the Crown, and Anselm made\r\nit too plain that the Archbishop rested his authority not on the favour of\r\nthe Crown, but on the discipline of the Christian religion. William was\r\nKing of England indisputably, but there was a higher power than the King,\r\nand that was the Pope. William himself never dreamed of denying the divine\r\nauthority of the Pope in spiritual matters; no one in all Christendom in\r\nthe eleventh and twelfth centuries questioned that at Rome was a court of\r\nappeal higher than the courts of kings. Strong rulers like William the\r\nConqueror might decline to submit to Rome on a personal question of\r\nmarriage, but Rome was the recognised centre of religion, the headquarters\r\nof the Christian Church, and the supreme court of appeal. Apart from Rome\r\nthere was no power that could curb the fierce unbridled tyranny of the\r\nkings of the earth, and the power of Rome was a spiritual weapon, for the\r\nPope had no army to enforce his decisions. So Anselm, conscious of this\r\nspiritual authority, refused to bow to the lawless rule of the Red King;\r\nand his very attitude, while it encouraged men to lift up their hearts who\r\nerstwhile had felt that it was hopeless and useless to strive against\r\nWilliam,[4] enraged the Red King to fury.\r\n\r\nThe things he wanted to forget were that the chief representative of the\r\nChristian religion was a greater person than the King of England, and that\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury could be a Christian minister rather than a\r\nKing's man.[5] And Anselm was the constant witness to the Christian\r\nreligion, and, by his very presence, a rebuke to the crimes and cruelties\r\nof the Court of the Red King. William actually wrote to the Pope, naturally\r\nwithout any success, praying him to depose Anselm, and promising a large\r\nannual tribute to Rome if the request was granted.\r\n\r\nFor years the uneven contest was waged. The bishops generally avoided\r\nAnselm, and were only anxious to be accepted by the King as good servants\r\nof the Crown, with the result that William despised them for their\r\nservility. But the barons began to declare their respect for the brave old\r\nman at Canterbury.\r\n\r\nAt last, when Anselm was summoned to appear before the King's Court, to \"do\r\nthe King right,\" on a trumped-up charge of having failed to send an\r\nadequate supply of troops for the King's service, he felt the position was\r\nhopeless. Anselm's longing had been to labour with the King, as Lanfranc\r\nhad laboured, to promote religion in the country, and he had been\r\nfrustrated at every turn. The summons to the King's Court was the last\r\nstraw, for the defendant in this Court was entirely at the mercy of the\r\nCrown. \"When, in Anglo-Norman times you speak of the King's Court, it is\r\nonly a phrase for the King's despotism.\"[6] Anselm took no notice of the\r\nKing's summons, and decided to appeal to Rome. For a time William refused\r\npermission for any departure from England, but he yielded in 1097, and\r\nAnselm set out for Rome.\r\n\r\nHe stayed at Rome and at Lyons till William was dead, for the Pope would\r\nnot let him resign Canterbury, and could do nothing to bring the King to a\r\nbetter mind. Then, on the urgent request of Henry I., he returned to\r\nEngland, and for a time all went well. Henry was in earnest for the\r\nrestoration of law and religion in England, and his declaration, at the\r\nvery beginning of his reign--the oft-quoted \"charter\" of Henry I.--to stop\r\nthe old scandals of selling and farming out Church lands, and to put down\r\nall unrighteousness that had been in his brother's time, was hailed with\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\nAnselm stood loyally by Henry over the question of his marriage with Edith\r\n(who claimed release from vows taken under compulsion in a convent at\r\nRomsey), and his fidelity at the critical time when Robert of Normandy and\r\nthe discontented nobles threatened the safety of the Crown was invaluable.\r\nBut Henry was an absolutist, anxious for all the threads of power to be in\r\nhis own hands; and just when a great Church Council at the Lateran had\r\ndecided that bishops must not be invested by kings with the ring and staff\r\nof their office, because by such investiture they were the king's vassals,\r\nHenry decided to invite Anselm to receive the archbishopric afresh from the\r\nKing's hands by a new act of investiture. To Anselm the abject submission\r\nof the bishops to the Red King had been a painful spectacle; and now Henry\r\nwas making a demand that would emphasise the royal supremacy, and the\r\ndemand was intolerable and impossible. Again Anselm stood practically alone\r\nin his resistance to the royal will, and again the question in dispute was\r\nwhether there was any power in England higher than the Crown. The papal\r\nsupremacy was no more under discussion than it had been under William. All\r\nthat Henry wanted was that the archbishops and bishops should acknowledge\r\nthat their authority came from the Crown; and at Henry's request Anselm,\r\nthen 70 years old, again journeyed to Rome to lay the matter before the\r\nPope.\r\n\r\nPope Paschal was fully alive to the mischief of making the bishops and\r\nclergy mere officers of kings, and it was soon seen there could be no\r\ndispensations from Rome even for Henry. All that the Pope would allow was\r\nthat bishops might do homage to the Crown for their temporal rights, and\r\nwith this Henry had to be content.\r\n\r\nIt was three years later before Anselm returned, and his course was now\r\nnearly run. He died at peace on April 21st, 1109, having wrought to no\r\nsmall purpose for religious liberty and the independence of the clergy.\r\n(The demand for political and social independence always follows the\r\nstruggle for independence in religion.) Anselm spent the greater part of\r\nhis life after his enthronement at Canterbury in battling for independence\r\nof the Crown; a century later Archbishop Stephen was to carry the battle\r\nstill further, and win wider liberties for England from the Crown.\r\n\r\nOf Anselm's general love of liberty and hatred of all tyranny many stories\r\nare told. One fact may be recalled. The Church Synod, which met at\r\nWestminster in 1102, at Anselm's request, attacked the slave trade as a\r\n\"wicked trade used hitherto in England, by which men are sold like brute\r\nanimals,\" and framed a Church rule against its continuance.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this decree, serfdom lingered in England for centuries, but\r\nhiring superseded open buying and selling of men. (The African slave trade\r\nwas the work of the Elizabethan seamen, and was excused, as slavery in the\r\nUnited States was excused, by the Protestant Churches on the ground of the\r\nracial inferiority of the negro.)\r\n\r\nTHOMAS À BECKET AND HENRY II.\r\n\r\nResistance to autocracy is often more needed against a strong and just king\r\nthan it is against an unprincipled profligate. Henry II.'s love of order\r\nand peace, the strength and energy he spent in curtailing the power of the\r\nbarons, and in making firm the foundations of our national system of petty\r\nsessions and assize courts have made for him an enduring fame. Henry II.\r\nwas a great lawyer; he was \"the flower of the princes of his world,\" in\r\ncontemporary eyes; but it was as an autocrat he would rule. Against this\r\nautocracy Thomas à Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, protested, and the\r\nprotest cost him five years of exile, and finally his life. The manner of\r\nhis death earned for the Archbishop the title of martyr, and popular\r\nacclamation required him to be canonised as a saint,[7] and his name to be\r\nlong cherished with deep devotion by the English people. Both Henry and\r\nThomas stand out honourably, but the former would have brought all England\r\nunder one great centralised authority, with the Crown not only predominant\r\nbut absolute in its supremacy, and the Archbishop contended for the great\r\nmass of poor and needy people to mitigate the harshness of the law, and to\r\nmaintain the liberties of the Church against the encroachments of\r\nsovereignty. \"Nothing is more certain,\" as the old writer put it, \"than\r\nthat both strove earnestly to do the will of God, one for the sake of his\r\nrealm, the other on behalf of his Church. But whether of the two was\r\nzealous in wisdom is not plain to man, who is so easily mistaken, but to\r\nthe Lord, Who will judge between them at the last day.\"\r\n\r\nBecket was the first English-born Archbishop of Canterbury since the Norman\r\nConquest. Henry, on his accession, clove to him in friendship, made him\r\nLord Chancellor in 1155, and on Archbishop Theobald's death, the monks of\r\nCanterbury at once accepted Henry's advice and elected him to the vacant\r\nsee. Becket himself knew the King too well to desire the appointment, and\r\nwarned Henry not to press the matter, and prophesied that their friendship\r\nwould be turned to bitter enmity. But Henry's mind was made up. As\r\nChancellor, Becket had shown no ecclesiastical bias. He had taxed clergy\r\nand laity with due impartiality, and his legal decisions had been given\r\nwithout fear or favour. Henry counted on Becket to act with the same\r\nindifference as Archbishop, to be the King's vicegerent during the royal\r\nabsence in France. And here Henry, wise as he was in many things, mistook\r\nhis man. As Chancellor of England Becket conceived his business to be the\r\nadministration of the laws: as Archbishop he was first and foremost the\r\nchampion of the Christian religion, the protector of the poor, and the\r\ndefender of the liberties of the Church. All unwilling, like his great\r\npredecessor, St. Anselm, to become archbishop, from the hour of his\r\nconsecration to the See of Canterbury, in 1162, Becket was as firm as\r\nAnselm had been in resisting the absolutism of the King. To the King's\r\nextreme annoyance the Chancellorship was at once given up--the only\r\ninstance known of the voluntary resignation of the Chancellorship by layman\r\nor ecclesiastic,[8] and all the amusements of the Court and the business of\r\nthe world were laid aside by the new archbishop. The care of his diocese,\r\nthe relief of the poor and the sick, and attendance at the sacred offices\r\nof the Church were henceforth the work of the man who had been Henry's\r\nbest-loved companion, and within a year of his enthronement friendship with\r\nthe King was broken.\r\n\r\nThe first point at issue was whether there should be one common\r\njurisdiction in all the land, or whether the Church courts should still\r\nexist. These Church courts had been set up by William the Conqueror and\r\nLanfranc, in order that the clergy should not be mixed up in ordinary law\r\nmatters, and should be excluded strictly from the common courts. No penalty\r\ninvolving bloodshed could be inflicted in the Church courts, and all the\r\nsavage barbarities of mutilation, common enough as punishments in the\r\nKing's court, were forbidden. Henry II., apart from his strong desire for\r\ncentralisation in government, wanted these Church courts abolished, because\r\nevery clerk who offended against the law escaped ordinary punishment, no\r\nmatter what the charge might be. Archbishop Thomas saw that in the Church\r\ncourts there was some protection, not only for the clergy, but for all\r\nminor ecclesiastics, and for widows and orphans, against the horrible legal\r\ncruelties of the age. \"It must be held in mind that the Archbishop had on\r\nhis side the Church or _Canon Law_, which he had sworn to obey, and\r\ncertainly the law courts erred as much on the side of harshness and cruelty\r\nas those of the Church on that of foolish pity towards evil doers.\"[9]\r\n\r\nBefore this dispute had reached its climax Thomas had boldly taken measures\r\nagainst some of the King's courtiers who were defrauding the See of\r\nCanterbury; and he had successfully withstood Henry's plan for turning the\r\nold Dane-geld shire tax, which was paid to the sheriff for the defence of\r\nthe country and the up-keep of roads, into a tax to be collected by the\r\nCrown as part of the royal revenue. Thomas told the King plainly that this\r\ntax was a voluntary offering to be paid to the sheriffs only \"so long as\r\nthey shall serve as fitly and maintain and defend our defendants,\" and said\r\npoint blank that he would not suffer a penny to be taken off his lands for\r\nthe King's purposes. Henry was obliged to yield, and this is the first case\r\nknown of resistance to the royal will in the matter of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe case of clerical offenders, and the jurisdiction of the courts came\r\nbefore a great council at Westminster in 1163. Henry declared that\r\ncriminous clerks should be deprived of their office in the Church courts,\r\nand then handed over to the King's courts for punishment. Thomas replied\r\nthat the proposal was contrary to the religious liberties of the land, but\r\nhe met with little support from the rest of the bishops. \"Better the\r\nliberties of the Church perish than that we perish ourselves,\" they cried\r\nin fear of the King. Henry followed up his proposal by calling on the\r\nbishops to abide by the old customs of the realm, as settled by his\r\ngrandfather, Henry I., and to this they all agreed, adding \"saving the\r\nrights of our order.\"\r\n\r\nA list of the old customs was drawn up, and sixteen _Constitutions_, or\r\narticles, were presented to the bishops at the Great Council of Clarendon,\r\nin January, 1164. To many of these Constitutions Thomas objected; notably\r\n(1) That clerks were to be tried in the King's courts for offences of\r\ncommon law. (2) That neither archbishops, bishops, nor beneficed clerks\r\nwere to leave the kingdom without royal permission. (This would not only\r\nstop appeals to Rome, it would make pilgrimages or attendance at General\r\nCouncils impossible without the King's consent.) (3) That no member of the\r\nKing's household was to be excommunicated without the King's permission.\r\n(4) That no appeals should be taken beyond the Archbishop's court, except\r\nto be brought before the King. (This definite prohibition of appeals to\r\nRome left the King absolute master in England.) The last article declared\r\nthat neither serfs nor the sons of villeins were to be ordained without the\r\nconsent of the lord on whose land they were born. Against his own judgment\r\nThomas yielded to the entreaties of the bishops, and agreed to accept the\r\nConstitutions of Clarendon, but no sooner had he done so than he bitterly\r\nrepented, and wrote off to the Pope acknowledging his mistake. Pope\r\nAlexander III. was mainly anxious to prevent open hostilities between Henry\r\nand the Archbishop, and wrote calmly that he was absolved, without\r\nsuggesting any blame to the King.\r\n\r\nHenry now saw that the Archbishop, and only the Archbishop, stood in the\r\nway of the royal will, and when another Council met at Northampton, in\r\nOctober, 1164, the King was ready to drive Thomas out of office. Before\r\nthis Council Thomas was charged with having refused justice to John, the\r\nTreasury-Marshall, and with contempt of the King's court, and was heavily\r\nfined. It was difficult to get sentence pronounced, for the barons declined\r\nto sit as judges on an archbishop; but at length, Henry, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, on the King's order, declared the sentence. Henry followed up\r\nthe attack next day by calling upon Thomas to account for 30,000 marks\r\nspent by him while Chancellor. In vain he proved that the Justiciar had\r\ndeclared him free of all claims when he laid down the Chancellorship, that\r\nthe charge was totally unexpected; the King refused to stay the proceedings\r\nunless Thomas would sign the Constitutions of Clarendon.\r\n\r\nConsultation with the bishops brought no help. \"The King has declared, so\r\nit is said, that he and you cannot both remain in England as king and\r\narchbishop. It would be much safer to resign everything and submit to his\r\nmercy\"; thus spake Hilary, of Chichester, and his fellow-bishops all urged\r\nresignation or submission.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the Archbishop came into the Council in full robes with the\r\nCross in his hand. Earl Robert, of Leicester, rose to pass sentence upon\r\nhim and at once the Archbishop refused to hear him. \"Neither law nor reason\r\npermit children to pass sentence on their father,\" he declared. \"I will not\r\nhear this sentence of the King, or any judgment of yours. For, under God, I\r\nwill be judged by the Pope alone, to whom before you all here I appeal,\r\nplacing the Church of Canterbury under God's protection and the protection\r\nof the Pope.\"\r\n\r\nThere were shouts of anger at these words, and some tore rushes from the\r\nfloor and flung at him, but no one dared to stop the Archbishop's passage\r\nas he passed from the hall. It was useless to look for help or justice in\r\nEngland, and that very night Thomas left England for Flanders to appeal to\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nBut Pope Alexander could do no more for Thomas than his predecessor had\r\ndone for Anselm; only he would not allow any resignation from Canterbury.\r\nHenry himself appealed to the Pope in 1166, fearing excommunication by the\r\nArchbishop; \"thus by a strange fate it happened that the King, while\r\nstriving for those 'ancient customs' by which he endeavoured to prevent any\r\nright of appeal (to the Pope), was doomed to confirm the right of appeal\r\nfor his own safety.\" The Pope did what he could to arrange a\r\nreconciliation, but it was not till 1170 that the King, seriously alarmed\r\nthat Thomas would place England under an interdict, agreed to a\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\nOn December 1st the exile was over, and Thomas landed at Sandwich, and went\r\nat once to Canterbury. There were many who doubted whether there could be\r\nlasting peace between the King and the Archbishop, and while the bishops\r\ngenerally hated the Primate's return, the nobles spoke openly of him as a\r\ntraitor to the King.\r\n\r\nThe end was near. Thomas, asked to withdraw the sentence of excommunication\r\nhe had passed against the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of London and\r\nSalisbury for violating the privileges of Canterbury, answered that the\r\nmatter must go before the Pope. The bishops, instead of going to Rome,\r\nhastened to Henry, who was keeping his Court at Bur, in France.\r\n\r\nHenry, at the complaint of the bishops, broke out into one of those\r\nterrible fits of anger which overcame him from time to time, and four\r\nknights left the Court saying, \"All this trouble will be at an end when\r\nThomas is dead, and not before.\" On December 29th these knights were at\r\nCanterbury, and at nightfall, just when vespers had begun, they slew\r\nArchbishop Thomas by the great pillar in the Cathedral. So died this great\r\nArchbishop for the liberties of the Church, and, as it seemed to him, for\r\nthe welfare of the people.\r\n\r\nHenry was horrified at the news of the Archbishop's death, and hastened to\r\nbeg absolution from Rome for the rash words that had provoked the murder.\r\nIn the presence of the Papal legate he promised to give up the\r\nConstitutions of Clarendon, nor in the remaining eighteen years of his\r\nreign did Henry make any fresh attempt to bring the Church under the\r\nsubjection of the Crown.\r\n\r\nTo the great bulk of English people Thomas was a saint and martyr, and\r\nnumerous churches were dedicated in his name. More than three hundred years\r\nlater Henry VIII. decided that St. Thomas was an enemy of princes, that his\r\nshrine at Canterbury must be destroyed, and his festival unhallowed. But\r\nthe fame of Thomas à Becket has survived the censure of Henry VIII., and\r\nhis name shines clearly across the centuries. Democracy has been made\r\npossible by the willingness of brave men in earlier centuries to resist, to\r\nthe death, an absolutism that would have left England bound and chained to\r\nthe king's throne.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN LANGTON AND JOHN\r\n\r\nStephen Langton was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury in June, 1207, on\r\nthe nomination of Pope Innocent III.; the monks of Canterbury, who had\r\nproposed their own superior, consenting to the appointment, for Langton had\r\na high reputation for learning and was known to be of exalted character.\r\nBut King John, who had wanted a man of his own heart for the\r\narchbishopric--John of Gray, Bishop of Norwich, commonly spoken of as \"a\r\nservant of Mammon, and an evil shepherd that devoured his own sheep\"--was\r\nenraged, and refusing to acknowledge Langton, defied the Pope, drove the\r\nmonks out of the country, and declared that anyone who acknowledged Stephen\r\nLangton as archbishop should be accounted a public enemy. So it came about\r\nthat the great English statesman who broke down the foulest and worst\r\ntyranny the land had known, and won for England the Great Charter of its\r\nliberties, was a nominee of the Pope, and was to find himself under the\r\ndispleasure of the Papal legate when the Charter had been signed! For six\r\nyears John kept Stephen out of Canterbury, while England lay under an\r\ninterdict, with its King excommunicate and outside the pale of the Church.\r\nMost of the bishops fled abroad, \"fearing the King, but afraid to obey him\r\nfor dread of the Pope,\" and John laid hands on Church property and filled\r\nthe royal treasury with the spoils of churchmen and Jews. But in 1213\r\nJohn's position had become precarious, for the northern barons were\r\nplotting his overthrow, and the Pope had absolved all his subjects from\r\nallegiance, and given sentence that \"John should be thrust from his throne\r\nand another worthier than he should reign in his stead,\" naming Philip of\r\nFrance as his successor. John was aware that he could not count on the\r\nsupport of the barons in a war with France, and a prophecy of Peter, the\r\nWakefield Hermit, that the crown would be lost before Ascension Day, made\r\nhim afraid of dying excommunicate. Accordingly John decided to get the Pope\r\non his side. He agreed to receive Pandulf, the Papal legate; to acknowledge\r\nStephen; make good the damage done to the Church, and, in addition,\r\nvoluntarily (\"of our own good free will and by the common counsel of our\r\nbarons\") surrendered \"to God and to the Holy Mother Church of Rome, and to\r\nPope Innocent and his Catholic successors,\" the whole realm of England and\r\nIreland, \"with all rights thereunto appertaining, to receive them back and\r\nhold them thenceforth as a feudatory of God and the Roman Church.\" He swore\r\nfealty to the Pope for both realms, and promised a yearly tribute of 1,000\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\nThis abject submission to the Pope was a matter of policy. John cared\r\nnothing for any appearance of personal or national humiliation, and as he\r\nhad broken faith with all in England, so, if it should suit his purpose,\r\nwould he as readily break faith with Rome. But the immediate advantage of\r\nhaving the Pope for his protector seemed considerable. \"For when once he\r\nhad put himself under apostolical protection and made his realms a part of\r\nthe patrimony of St. Peter, there was not in the Roman world a sovereign\r\nwho durst attack him or would invade his lands, in such awe was Pope\r\nInnocent held above all his predecessors for many years past.\"[10]\r\n\r\nStephen landed in June, 1213, and at Winchester John was formally absolved\r\nand the coronation oaths were renewed. It was very soon seen what manner of\r\nman the Archbishop was. In August a great gathering of the barons took\r\nplace in St. Paul's, and there Langton recited the coronation charter of\r\nHenry I., and told all those assembled that these rights and liberties were\r\nto be recovered; and \"the barons swore they would fight for these\r\nliberties, even unto death if it were needful, and the Archbishop promised\r\nthat he would help with all his might.\" The weakness of the barons hitherto\r\nhad been their want of cohesion, their endless personal feuds, and the lack\r\nof any feeling of national responsibility. Langton laboured to create a\r\nnational party and to win recognition of law and justice for all in\r\nEngland; and the Great Charter was the issue of his work.\r\n\r\nThe state of things was intolerable. The whole administration of justice\r\nwas corrupt. The decisions of the King's courts were as arbitrary as the\r\nmethods employed to enforce sentence. Free men were arrested, evicted,\r\nexiled, and outlawed without even legal warrant or the semblance of a fair\r\ntrial. All the machinery of government set up by the Norman kings, and\r\ndeveloped under Henry II., had, in John's hands, become a mere instrument\r\nof despotic extortion, to be used against anybody and everybody, from earl\r\nto villein, who could be fleeced by the King's servants.\r\n\r\nJohn saw the tide rising against him, and endeavoured to divide barons from\r\nChurchmen by proclaiming that the latter should have free and undisturbed\r\nright of election when bishoprics and other ecclesiastical offices were\r\nvacant. But the attempt failed. Langton was too resolute a statesman, and\r\nhis conception of the primacy of Canterbury was too high for any turning\r\nback from the work he had set himself to accomplish. The rights of election\r\nin the Church were important, but the restoration of justice and order and\r\nthe ending of tyranny were, in his eyes, hardly less important. John, who\r\nhad been at war in France, returned defeated from his last attempt to\r\nrecover for the Crown the lost Angevin provinces, to face a discontent that\r\nwas both wide and general. The people, and in especial the barons and\r\nknights whom for fourteen years John had robbed, insulted, and spurned, and\r\nwhose liberties he had trampled upon, were ready at last under wise\r\nleadership to end the oppression.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1214, the Archbishop saw that the time was come for action,\r\nand again the barons met in council. Before the high altar in the Abbey\r\nChurch of St. Edmundsbury they swore that if the King sought to evade their\r\ndemand for the laws and liberties of Henry I.'s charter, they would make\r\nwar upon him until he pledged himself to confirm their rights in a charter\r\nunder royal seal. \"They also agreed that after Christmas they would go all\r\ntogether to the King and ask him for a confirmation of these liberties, and\r\nthat meanwhile they would so provide themselves with horses and arms that\r\nif the King should seek to break his oath, they might, by seizing his\r\ncastles, compel him to make satisfaction. And when these things were done\r\nevery man returned to his own home.\"[11]\r\n\r\nJohn now asked for time to consider these requests, and for the next six\r\nmonths worked hard to break up the barons' confederacy, to gain friends and\r\nsupporters, and to get mercenaries from Poitou. It was all to no purpose.\r\nAs a last resource he took the Cross, expecting to be saved as a crusader\r\nfrom attack, and at the same time he wrote to the Pope to help his faithful\r\nvassal. The Pope's letters rebuking the barons for conspiracy against the\r\nKing were unheeded, and the mercenaries were inadequate when John was\r\nconfronted by the whole baronage in arms.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT CHARTER\r\n\r\nIn May a list of articles to be signed was sent to John; and on his refusal\r\nthe barons formally renounced their homage and fealty and flew to arms.\r\nJohn was forced to surrender before this host. On June 15th he met the\r\nbarons at Runnymede, between Staines and Windsor, and there, in the\r\npresence of Archbishop Stephen and \"a multitude of most illustrious\r\nknights,\" sealed the Great Charter of the Liberties of England.\r\n\r\nThis Great Charter was in the main a renewal of the old rights and\r\nliberties promised by Henry I. It set up no new rights, conferred no new\r\nprivileges, and sanctioned no changes in the Constitution. Its real and\r\nlasting importance is due to its being a written document--for the first\r\ntime in England it was down in black and white, for all to read, what the\r\nseveral rights and duties of King and people were, and in what the chief\r\npoints of the Constitution consisted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGNA CHARTA\r\n\r\nA facsimile of the Original in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe Great Charter is a great table of laws. It marks the beginning of\r\nwritten legislation, and anticipates Acts of Parliament. Unwritten laws and\r\ntraditions were not abolished: they remain with us to this day; but the\r\nwritten law had become a necessity when \"the bonds of unwritten custom\"\r\nfailed to restrain kings and barons. The Great Charter also took into\r\naccount the rights of free men, and of the tenants of the King's vassals.\r\nIf the barons and knights had their grievances to be redressed, the commons\r\nand the freeholding peasants needed protection against the lawless\r\nexactions of their overlords.[12]\r\n\r\nSixty-three clauses make up Magna Charta, and we may summarise them as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n(1) The full rights and liberties of the Church are acknowledged; bishops\r\nshall be freely elected, so that the Church of England shall be free.[13]\r\n\r\n(2-8) The King's tenants are to have their feudal rights secured against\r\nabuse. Widows--in the wardship of the Crown--are to be protected against\r\nrobbery and against compulsion to a second marriage.\r\n\r\n(9-11) The harsh rules for securing the payment of debts to the Crown and\r\nto the Jews (in whose debts the Crown had an interest) are to be relaxed.\r\n\r\n(12-14) No scutage or aid (save for the three regular feudal aids--the\r\nransom of the King, the knighting of his eldest son, and the marriage of\r\nhis eldest daughter) is to be imposed except by the Common Council of the\r\nnation; and to this Council archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and\r\ngreater barons are to be called by special writ, while all who held their\r\nland directly from the King, and were of lesser rank, were to be summoned\r\nby a general writ addressed to the sheriff of the county. Forty days'\r\nnotice of the meeting was to be given, and also the cause of the assembly.\r\nThe action of those who obeyed the summons was to be taken to represent the\r\naction of all.[14] (This last clause is never repeated in later\r\nconfirmations of the Great Charter.)\r\n\r\n(15-16) The powers of lords over their tenants are limited and defined.\r\n\r\n(17-19) A Court of Common Pleas is to be held in some fixed place so that\r\nsuitors are not obliged to follow the King's Curia. Cases touching the\r\nownership of land are to be tried in the counties by visiting justices, and\r\nby four knights chosen by the county.\r\n\r\n(20-23) No freeman is to be fined beyond his offence, and the penalty is to\r\nbe fixed by a local jury. Earls and barons to be fined by their peers; and\r\nclerks only according to the amount of their lay property.\r\n\r\n(24-33) The powers of sheriffs, constables, coroners, and bailiffs of the\r\nKing are strictly defined. No sheriff is to be a justice in his own county.\r\nRoyal officers are to pay for all the goods taken by requisition; money is\r\nnot to be taken in lieu of service from those who are willing to perform\r\nthe service. The horses and carts of freemen are not to be seized for royal\r\nwork without consent. The weirs in the Thames, Medway, and other rivers in\r\nEngland are to be removed.\r\n\r\n(34-38) Uniformity of weights and measures is directed. Inquests are to be\r\ngranted freely. The sole wardship of minors who have other lords will not\r\nbe claimed by the King, except in special cases. No bailiff may force a man\r\nto ordeal without witnesses.\r\n\r\n(39-40) No free man is to be taken, imprisoned, ousted of his land,\r\noutlawed, banished, or hurt in any way save by the judgment of his peers,\r\nor the law of the land. The King is not to sell, delay, or deny right or\r\njustice to anyone.\r\n\r\n(41-42) Merchants may go out or come in without paying exorbitant customs.\r\nAll \"lawful\" men are to have a free right to pass in and out of England in\r\ntime of peace.\r\n\r\n(44-47) An inquiry into the Forest Laws and a reform of the forest abuses\r\nare promised. All forests made in present reign to be disforested, and all\r\nfences in rivers thrown down.\r\n\r\n(49-60) The foreign mercenaries of the King, all the detested gang that\r\ncame with horses and arms to the hurt of the realm, are to be sent out of\r\nthe country. The Welsh princes and the King of Scots (who had sided with\r\nthe barons) are to have justice done. A general amnesty for all political\r\noffences arising from the struggle is made.\r\n\r\nThe last three articles appointed twenty-five barons, chosen out of the\r\nwhole baronage, to watch over the keeping of the Charter. They were\r\nempowered to demand that any breach of the articles should at once be put\r\nright, and, in default to make war on the King till the matter was settled\r\nto their satisfaction. Finally there was the oath to be taken on the part\r\nof the King, and on the part of the barons that the articles of the Charter\r\nshould be observed in good faith according to their plain meaning.\r\n\r\nThe Great Charter was signed, and then in a wild burst of rage John shouted\r\nto his foreign supporters, \"They have given me five-and-twenty over-kings!\"\r\n\r\nWithin a week of Runnymede the Great Charter was published throughout\r\nEngland, but neither King nor barons looked for peace. John was ready to\r\nbreak all oaths, and while he set about increasing his army of mercenaries,\r\nhe also appealed to the Pope, as his overlord, protesting that the Charter\r\nhad been wrested from him by force.\r\n\r\nLangton and the bishops left for Rome to attend a general council. Pope\r\nInnocent declared the Charter annulled on the ground that both King and\r\nbarons had made the Pope overlord of England, and that consequently nothing\r\nin the government could be changed without his consent. But with Langton,\r\nthe bishops, and the Papal legate all away at Rome, there was no one to\r\npublish the Papal repudiation of the Charter, and the King and barons were\r\nalready at civil war. Pope Innocent III. was dead in the spring of 1216,\r\nand John's wretched reign was over when the King lay dying at Newark in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nStephen Langton was back again at Canterbury in 1217, and for eleven more\r\nyears worked with William the Marshall and Hubert of Burgh to maintain\r\npublic peace and order during Henry III.'s boyhood. At Oxford, in 1223, the\r\nCharter was confirmed afresh, and two years later it was solemnly\r\nproclaimed again when the King wanted a new subsidy. As long as the great\r\nstatesmen were in office Henry III. was saved from the weakness that cursed\r\nhis rule in England for nearly forty years. But William the Marshall died\r\nin 1219, Archbishop Stephen in 1228, and Hubert was dismissed from the\r\njusticiarship in 1234. A horde of greedy aliens from Poitou fed at the\r\nCourt of Henry and devoured the substance of England, until men arose, as\r\nLangton had arisen, to demand the enforcement of charters and a just\r\nadministration of the laws.\r\n\r\nAgain a national party arises under the leadership of Simon of Montfort,\r\nand in their victory over the King we get the beginnings of Parliamentary\r\ngovernment and popular representation. Every step forward is followed by\r\nreaction, but the ground lost is recovered, and the next step taken marks\r\nalways a steady advance. Over and over again it has seemed that all the\r\nliberties won in the past were lost, but looking back we can see that there\r\nhas been no lasting defeat of liberty. Only for a time have the forces of\r\noppression triumphed; it is soon found impossible in England to rest under\r\ntyranny, or to govern without the consent of the governed. And every fresh\r\ncampaign for the restriction of kingly power brings us nearer the day of\r\ndemocratic government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY AND REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nTo-day democracy takes the form of representative government in civilised\r\ncountries; and for representative government contend the nations and\r\npeoples seeking democracy.\r\n\r\nThe weak spots in all popular electoral systems are obvious, and the\r\nelection of representatives is always a subject for jokes and satire. It\r\ncould hardly be otherwise. For the best machinery in the world needs some\r\nsort of sympathetic intelligence in the person who manipulates it, and the\r\nmachinery of popular elections can only be worked successfully with a large\r\nmeasure of sincerity and good will. In the hands of the ambitious, the\r\nself-seeking, and the unscrupulous, democratic politics are a machine for\r\nfrustrating popular representation, and as this state of things is always\r\nprevalent somewhere, the humorist and the satirist naturally treat politics\r\nwithout respect.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all its faults and failings--glaring as these are--mankind\r\ncan at present devise nothing better than representative government, and\r\nthe abuse of power, the cunning, roguery, and corruption that too often\r\naccompany popular elections and democratic administration, rather stir\r\nhonest men to action than make them incline to dictatorship and absolutism.\r\n\r\nThe present notion about representative government is that it makes\r\npossible the expression of popular will, and can ensure the fulfilment of\r\nthat will. In the thirteenth century, when we get the beginnings of\r\nrepresentative government, there is no question of the people making\r\npositive proposals in legislation, but there is a distinct belief that the\r\nconsent of the governed ought to be obtained by the ruling power. The mere\r\nlegal maxim from the Code of Justinian, that \"that which touches all shall\r\nbe approved by all,\"[15] \"becomes transmuted by Edward I. into a great\r\npolitical and constitutional principle.\"[16]\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATIVE THEORY FIRST FOUND IN ECCLESIASTICAL ASSEMBLIES\r\n\r\nMore than a century earlier the first recorded appearances of town\r\nrepresentatives are found in the Spanish Cortes of Aragon and Castile.[17]\r\nSt. Dominic makes a representative form of government the rule in his Order\r\nof Preaching Friars, each priory sending two representatives to its\r\nprovincial chapter, and each province sending two representatives to the\r\ngeneral chapter of the Order.\r\n\r\nIn England, Simon of Montfort, the son of Simon, the great warrior of the\r\nAlbigensian wars and the warm friend of Dominic, was in close association\r\nwith the friars. Hence there was nothing so very remarkable in Earl Simon\r\nissuing writs for the Full Parliament of 1265 for the return of two\r\nburgesses from each city and borough. He had seen representative government\r\nat work among the friars in their chapters. Why should the plan be not\r\nequally useful in the government of the country?[18] There is no evidence\r\nthat the summons to the burgesses was regarded as a revolutionary\r\nproposal--so lightly comes political change in England.\r\n\r\nThe name of Simon of Montfort, Earl of Leicester, must always be associated\r\nwith the beginning of representative government in England. Let us recall\r\nhow it was the great Earl came to be in power in 1265.\r\n\r\nTHE MISRULE OF HENRY III.\r\n\r\nHenry III. was always in want of money, and his crew of royal parasites\r\nfrom Poitou drained the exchequer. Over and over again the barons called on\r\nthe King to get rid of his favourites, and to end the misrule that\r\nafflicted the country; and the King from time to time gave promises of\r\namendment. But the promises were always broken. As long as Henry could get\r\nmoney he was averse from all constitutional reform. In 1258 the barons were\r\ndetermined that a change must be made. \"If the King can't do without us in\r\nwar, he must listen to us in peace,\" they declared. \"And what sort of peace\r\nis this when the King is led astray by bad counsellors, and the land is\r\nfilled with foreign tyrants who grind down native-born Englishmen?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam of Rishanger, a contemporary writer, expressed the popular feeling\r\nin well-known verses:\r\n\r\n  \"The King that tries without advice to seek his country's weal\r\n  Must often fail; he cannot know the wants and woes they feel.\r\n  The Parliament must tell the King how he may serve them best,\r\n  And he must see their wants fulfilled and injuries redressed.\r\n  A King should seek his people's good and not his own sweet will.\r\n  Nor think himself a slave because men hold him back from ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"The King's mistakes call for special treatment,\" said Richard, Earl of\r\nGloucester.\r\n\r\nSIMON OF MONTFORT, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL PARTY\r\n\r\nSo that year a Parliament met in Oxford, in the Dominican Priory. It was\r\ncalled the \"Mad Parliament,\" because the barons all came to it fully armed,\r\nand civil war seemed imminent. But Earl Simon and Richard of Gloucester\r\ncarried the barons with them in demanding reform. Henry was left without\r\nsupporters, and civil war was put off for five years.\r\n\r\nThe work done at this Parliament of Oxford was an attempt to make the King\r\nabide loyally by the Great Charter; and the Provisions of Oxford, as they\r\nwere called, set up a standing council of fifteen, by whom the King was to\r\nbe guided, and ordered that Parliament was to meet three times a year: at\r\nCandlemas (February 2nd), on June 1st, and at Michaelmas. Four knights were\r\nto be chosen by the King's lesser freeholders in each county to attend this\r\nParliament, and the baronage was to be represented by twelve commissioners.\r\n\r\nIt was an oligarchy that the Provisions of Oxford established, \"intended\r\nrather to fetter the King than to extend or develop the action of the\r\ncommunity at large. The baronial council clearly regards itself as\r\ncompetent to act on behalf of all the estates of the realm, and the\r\nexpedient of reducing the national deliberations to three sessions of\r\nselect committees betrays a desire to abridge the frequent and somewhat\r\nirksome duty of attendance in Parliament rather than to share the central\r\nlegislative and deliberative power with the whole body of the people. It\r\nmust, however, be remembered that the scheme makes a very indistinct claim\r\nto the character of a final arrangement.\"[19]\r\n\r\nFor a time things went better in England. The aliens at Henry's Court fled\r\nover-seas, and their posts were filled by Englishmen. Parliament also\r\npromised that the vassals of the nobles should have better treatment, and\r\nthat the sheriffs should be chosen by the shire-moots, the county\r\nfreeholders.\r\n\r\nBut Henry's promises were quickly broken, and war broke out on the Welsh\r\nborders between Simon of Montfort's friend Llewellyn and Mortimer and the\r\nMarchers. Edward, Prince of Wales, stood by the Provisions of Oxford for a\r\nfew years, but supported his father when the latter refused to re-confirm\r\nthe Provisions in 1263. As a last resource to prevent civil war, Simon and\r\nHenry agreed to appeal to King Louis of France to arbitrate on the\r\nfulfilment of the Provisions. The Pope had already absolved Henry from\r\nobedience to the Provisions, and the Award of Louis, given at Amiens and\r\ncalled the _Mise of Amiens_, was entirely in Henry's favour. It annulled\r\nthe Provisions of Oxford, left the King free to appoint his own ministers,\r\ncouncil, and sheriffs, to employ aliens, and to enjoy power uncontrolled.\r\nBut the former charters of the realm were declared inviolate, and no\r\nreprisals were to take place.\r\n\r\nTo Simon and most of the barons the Award was intolerable, and when Henry\r\nreturned from France with a large force ready to take the vengeance which\r\nthe Award had forbidden, civil war could not be prevented. London rallied\r\nto Simon, and Oxford, the Cinque Ports, and the friars were all on the side\r\nof the barons against the King.\r\n\r\nOn May 14th, 1264, a pitched battle at Lewes ended in complete victory for\r\nSimon, and found the King, Prince Edward, and the kinsmen and chief\r\nsupporters of the Crown prisoners in his hands.\r\n\r\nPeace was made, and a treaty--the _Mise of Lewes_--drawn up and signed.\r\nOnce more the King promised to keep the Provisions and Charters, and to\r\ndismiss the aliens. He also agreed to live thriftily till his debts were\r\npaid, and to leave his sons as hostages with Earl Simon.\r\n\r\nSimon at once set about the work of reform. The King's Standing, or Privy,\r\nCouncil was reconstituted, and the Parliamentary Commissioners were\r\nabolished, \"for Simon held it as much a man's duty to think and work for\r\nhis country as to fight for it.\" A marked difference is seen between\r\nSimon's policy at Oxford and the policy after Lewes. The Provisions of 1258\r\nwere restrictive. The Constitution of 1264 deliberately extended the limits\r\nof Parliament. \"Either Simon's views of a Constitution had rapidly\r\ndeveloped, or the influences which had checked them in 1258 were removed.\r\nAnyhow, he had genius to interpret the mind of the nation, and to\r\nanticipate the line which was taken by later progress.\"[20] What Simon\r\nwanted was the approval of all classes of the community for his plans, and\r\nto that end he issued writs for the Parliament--the _Full Parliament_--of\r\n1265.\r\n\r\nThe great feature of this Parliament was that for the first time the\r\nburgesses of each city and borough were summoned to send two\r\nrepresentatives. In addition, two knights were to come from each shire, and\r\nclergy and barons as usual--though in the case of the earls and barons only\r\ntwenty-three were invited, for Simon had no desire for the presence of\r\nthose who were his enemies. The Full Parliament sat till March, and then\r\ntwo months later war had once more blazed out. Earl Gilbert of Gloucester\r\nbroke away from Simon, Prince Edward escaped from custody, and these two\r\njoined Lord Mortimer and the Welsh Marchers.\r\n\r\nOn August 4th Edward surprised and routed the army of the younger Simon\r\nnear Kenilworth, and then advanced to crush the great Earl, who was\r\nencamped at Evesham, waiting to join forces with his son. All hope of\r\nescape for Earl Simon was lost, and he was outnumbered by seven to two. But\r\nfly he would not. One by one the barons who stood by Simon were cut down,\r\nbut though wounded and dismounted, the great Earl \"fought on to the last\r\nlike a giant for the freedom of England, till a foot soldier stabbed him in\r\nthe back under the mail, and he was borne down and slain.\" For three hours\r\nthe unequal fight lasted in the midst of storm and darkness, and when it\r\nwas over the Grey Friars carried the mangled body of the dead Earl into the\r\npriory at Evesham, and laid it before the high altar, for the poorer clergy\r\nand the common people all counted Simon of Montfort for a saint.\r\n\r\n\"Those who knew Simon praise his piety, admire his learning, and extol his\r\nprowess as a knight and skill as a general. They tell of his simple fare\r\nand plain russet dress, bear witness to his kindly speech and firm\r\nfriendship to all good men, describe his angry scorn for liars and unjust\r\nmen, and marvel at his zeal for truth and right, which was such that\r\nneither pleasure nor threats nor promises could turn him aside from keeping\r\nthe oath he swore at Oxford; for he held up the good cause 'like a pillar\r\nthat cannot be moved, and, like a second Josiah, esteemed righteousness the\r\nvery healing of his soul.' As a statesman he wished to bind the King to\r\nrule according to law, and to make the King's Ministers responsible to a\r\nFull Parliament; and though he did not live to see the success of his\r\npolicy, he had pointed out the way by which future statesmen might bring it\r\nabout.\"[21]\r\n\r\nIn the hour of Simon's death it might seem that the cause of good\r\ngovernment was utterly lost, and for a time Henry triumphed with a fierce\r\nreaction. But the very barons who had turned against Simon were quite\r\ndetermined that the Charters should be observed, and Edward was to show, on\r\nhis coming to the throne, that he had grasped even more fully than Simon\r\nthe notion of a national representative assembly, and that he accepted the\r\nprinciple, \"that which touches all shall be approved by all.\"\r\n\r\nHenry III. died in 1272, and it was not till two years later that Edward I.\r\nwas back in England from the crusades to take up the crown. It was an age\r\nof great lawgivers; an age that saw St. Louis ruling in France, Alfonso the\r\nWise in Castile, the Emperor Frederick II.--the Wonder of the World--in\r\nSicily. In England Edward shaped the Constitution and settled for future\r\ntimes the lines of Parliamentary representative government.\r\n\r\nEDWARD I.'S MODEL PARLIAMENT, 1295\r\n\r\nFor the first twenty years Edward's Parliaments were great assemblies of\r\nbarons and knights, and it was not till 1295 that the famous Model\r\nParliament was summoned. \"It is very evident that common dangers must be\r\nmet by measures concerted in common,\" ran the writ to the bishops. Every\r\nsheriff was to cause two knights to be elected from each shire, two\r\ncitizens from each city, two burgesses from each borough. The clergy were\r\nto be fully represented from each cathedral and each diocese.\r\n\r\nHitherto Parliament, save in 1265, had been little else than a feudal\r\ncourt, a council of the King's tenants; it became, after 1295, a national\r\nassembly. Edward's plan was that the three estates--clergy, barons, and\r\ncommons: those who pray, those who fight, and those who work--should be\r\nrepresented. But the clergy always stood aloof, preferring to meet in their\r\nown houses of convocation; and the archbishops, bishops, and greater abbots\r\nonly attended because they were great holders of land and important feudal\r\nlords.\r\n\r\nAlthough the knights of the shire were of much the same class as the\r\nbarons, the latter received personal summons to attend, and the knights\r\njoined with the representatives of the cities and boroughs. So the two\r\nHouses of Parliament consisted of barons and bishops--lords spiritual and\r\nlords temporal--and knights and commons; and we have to-day the House of\r\nLords and the House of Commons; the former, as in the thirteenth century,\r\nlords spiritual and temporal, the latter, representatives from counties and\r\nboroughs.\r\n\r\nThe admission of elected representatives was to move, in course of time,\r\nthe centre of government from the Crown to the House of Commons; but in\r\nEdward I.'s reign Parliament was just a larger growth of the King's\r\nCouncil--the Council that Norman and Plantagenet kings relied on for\r\nassistance in the administration of justice and the collection of revenue.\r\nThe judges of the supreme court were always summoned to Parliament, as the\r\nlaw lords sit in the Upper House to-day.\r\n\r\nMoney, or rather the raising of money, was the main cause for calling a\r\nParliament. The clergy at first voted their own grants to the Crown in\r\nconvocation, but came to agree to pay the taxes voted by Lords and Commons,\r\nAnd Lords and Commons, instead of making separate grants, joined in a\r\ncommon grant.\r\n\r\n\"And, as the bulk of the burden fell upon the Commons, they adopted a\r\nformula which placed the Commons in the foreground. The grant was made by\r\nthe Commons, with the assent of the Lords spiritual and temporal. This\r\nformula appeared in 1395, and became the rule. In 1407, eight years after\r\nHenry IV. came to the throne, he assented to the important principle that\r\nmoney grants were to be initiated by the House of Commons, were not to be\r\nreported to the King until both Houses were agreed, and were to be reported\r\nby the Speaker of the Commons' House. This rule is strictly observed at the\r\npresent day. When a money bill, such as the Finance bill for the year or\r\nthe Appropriation bill, has been passed by the House of Commons and agreed\r\nto by the House of Lords, it is, unlike all other bills, returned to the\r\nHouse of Commons.\"[22] The Speaker, with his own hand, delivers all money\r\nbills to the Clerk of Parliaments, the officer whose business it is to\r\nsignify the royal assent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to voting money, the Commons, on the assembly of Parliament,\r\nwould petition for the redress of grievances. In the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries, they were not legislators, but petitioners for\r\nlegislation; and as it often happened that their petitions were not granted\r\nin the form they asked, it became a matter of bitter complaint that the\r\nlaws did not correspond with the petitions. Henry V. in 1414 granted the\r\nrequest that \"nothing should be enacted to the petition of the Commons\r\ncontrary to their asking, whereby they should be bound without their\r\nassent\"; and from that time it became customary for bills to be sent up to\r\nthe Crown instead of petitions, leaving the King the alternative of assent\r\nor reaction.\r\n\r\nTHE NOBILITY PREDOMINANT IN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the power of Parliament was\r\nstrong enough to force the abdication of two kings--Edward II. and Richard\r\nII.--but not strong enough to free the land of the turbulent authority of\r\nthe nobles. This authority went down in the struggles of the Lancastrians\r\nand Yorkists.\r\n\r\n\"The bloody faction fights known as the Wars of the Roses brought the\r\nPlantagenet dynasty to a close, weeded out the older nobility, and cleared\r\nthe way for a new form of monarchy.\"[23]\r\n\r\n\"The high nobility killed itself out. The great barons who adhered to the\r\n'Red Rose' or the 'White Rose,' or who fluctuated from one to the other,\r\nbecame poorer, fewer, and less potent every year. When the great struggle\r\nended at Bosworth, a large part of the greatest combatants were gone. The\r\nrestless, aspiring, rich barons, who made the civil war, were broken by it.\r\nHenry VII. attained a kingdom in which there was a Parliament to advise,\r\nbut scarcely a Parliament to control.\"[24]\r\n\r\nIt is important to note the ascendancy of the barons in the medieval\r\nParliaments, and their self-destruction in the Wars of the Roses. Unless we\r\nrealise how very largely the barons were the Parliament, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand how it came about that Parliament was so utterly impotent under\r\nthe Tudors. The Wars of the Roses killed off the mighty parliamentarians,\r\nand it took a hundred years to raise the country landowners into a party\r\nwhich, under Eliot, Hampden, and Pym, was to make the House of Commons\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\n\"The civil wars of many years killed out the old councils (if I might so\r\nsay): that is, destroyed three parts of the greater nobility, who were its\r\nmost potent members, tired the small nobility and gentry, and overthrew the\r\naristocratic organisation on which all previous effectual resistance to the\r\nsovereign had been based.\"[25]\r\n\r\nTo get an idea of the weakness of Parliament when the Tudors ruled, we have\r\nbut to suppose at the present day a Parliament deprived of all front-bench\r\nmen on both sides of the House, and of the leaders of the Irish and Labour\r\nparties, and a House of Lords deprived of all Ministers and ex-Ministers.\r\n\r\nTHE MEDIEVAL NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the Parliamentary revival of the seventeenth century,\r\nthere still remain one or two points to be considered relating to the early\r\nnational assemblies of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\r\n\r\n(1) _Who were the electors in the Middle Ages?_--In the counties, all who\r\nwere entitled to attend and take part in the proceedings of the county\r\ncourt had the right of electing the knight of the shire; and \"it is most\r\nprobable, on the evidence of records, on the analogies of representative\r\nusage, and on the testimony of later facts, that the knights of the shire\r\nwere elected by the full county court.\"[26]\r\n\r\nThe county court or shire-moot not only elected knights for Parliament; it\r\noften enough elected them for local purposes as well. The county coroner\r\nwas elected in similar fashion by the county. All the chief tenants and\r\nsmall freeholders were therefore the county electors; but the\r\ntenants-in-chief (who held their lands from the Crown) and the knights of\r\nthe county had naturally considerably more influence than the smaller men.\r\n\"The chief lord of a great manor would have authority with his tenants,\r\nfreeholders as they might be, which would make their theoretical equality a\r\nmere shadow, and would, moreover, be exercised all the more easily because\r\nthe right which it usurped was one which the tenant neither understood nor\r\ncared for.\"[27]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to decide to what extent the smaller freeholders could take\r\nan active interest in the affairs of the county. As for the office of\r\nknight of the shire, there was no competition in the thirteenth or\r\nfourteenth century for the honour of going to Parliament, and it is likely\r\nenough that the sheriff, upon whom rested the responsibility for the\r\nelections, would in some counties be obliged to nominate and compel the\r\nattendance of an unwilling candidate.\r\n\r\n(2) _Payment of Parliamentary Representatives._--The fact that Members of\r\nParliament were paid by their constituents in the thirteenth, fourteenth,\r\nand fifteenth centuries[28] made certain small freeholders as anxious not\r\nto be included in the electorate as others were anxious not to be elected\r\nto Parliament. It was recognised as \"fair that those persons who were\r\nexcluded from the election should be exempt from contribution to the wages.\r\nAnd to many of the smaller freeholders the exemption from payment would be\r\nfar more valuable than the privilege of voting.\"[29] But the Commons\r\ngenerally petitioned for payment to be made by all classes of freeholders,\r\nand when all allowance has been made for varying customs and for local\r\ndiversities and territorial influence, it is safe to take it that the\r\nfreeholders were the body of electors.\r\n\r\nIn 1430, the eighth year of Henry VI., an Act was passed ordering that\r\nelectors must be resident in the country, and must have free land or\r\ntenement to the value of 40s. a year at least; and this Act was in\r\noperation till 1831.\r\n\r\nThe county franchise was a simple and straightforward matter compared with\r\nthe methods of electing representatives from the boroughs. All that the\r\nsheriff was ordered to do by writ was to provide for the return of two\r\nmembers for each city or borough in his county; the places that were to be\r\nconsidered as boroughs were not named. In the Middle Ages a town might have\r\nno wish to be taxed for the wages of its Parliamentary representative, and\r\nin that case would do its best to come to an arrangement with the sheriff.\r\n(It was not till the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that a\r\nconsiderable increase of boroughs took place. The Tudors created \"pocket\"\r\nand \"rotten\" boroughs in order to have the nominees of the Crown in\r\nParliament.) The size of the borough bore no relation to its membership\r\ntill the Reform Act of the nineteenth century, and as the selection of\r\ntowns to be represented was arbitrary, so the franchise in the towns was\r\nequally unsettled. One or two places had a wide franchise, others confined\r\nthe vote to freemen and corporation members. But in spite of the\r\nextraordinary vagaries of the borough franchise, and the arbitrary\r\nselection of towns to be represented, these early medieval Parliaments\r\nreally did in an imperfect way represent the nation--all but the peasants\r\nand artisans.\r\n\r\n\"Our English Parliaments were _un_symmetrical realities. They were elected\r\nanyhow. The sheriff had a considerable licence in sending writs to\r\nboroughs, that is, he could in part pick its constituencies; and in each\r\nborough there was a rush and scramble for the franchise, so that the\r\nstrongest local party got it whether few or many. But in England at that\r\ntime there was a great and distinct desire to know the opinion of the\r\nnation, because there was a real and close necessity. The nation was wanted\r\nto do something--to assist the sovereign in some war, to pay some old debt,\r\nto contribute its force and aid in the critical juncture of the time. It\r\nwould not have suited the ante-Tudor kings to have had a fictitious\r\nassembly; they would have lost their sole _feeler_, their only instrument\r\nfor discovering national opinion. Nor could they have manufactured such an\r\nassembly if they wished. Looking at the mode of election, a theorist would\r\nsay that these Parliaments were but 'chance' collections of influential\r\nEnglishmen. There would be many corrections and limitations to add to that\r\nstatement if it were wanted to make it accurate, but the statement itself\r\nhits exactly the principal excellence of these Parliaments. If not 'chance'\r\ncollections of Englishmen, they were 'undesigned' collections; no\r\nadministrations made them, or could make them. They were bona fide\r\ncounsellors, whose opinion might be wise or unwise, but was anyhow of\r\nparamount importance, because their co-operation was wanted for what was in\r\nhand.\"[30]\r\n\r\n(3) _The political position of women in the Middle Ages._--Abbesses were\r\nsummoned to the convocations of clergy in Edward I.'s reign. Peeresses were\r\npermitted to be represented by proxy in Parliament. The offices of sheriff,\r\nhigh constable, governor of a royal castle, and justice of the peace have\r\nall been held by women. In fact, the lady of the manor had the same rights\r\nas the lord of the manor, and joined with men who were freeholders in\r\nelecting knights of the shire without question of sex disability.[31] (A\r\nsurvival of the medieval rights of women may be seen in the power of women\r\nto present clergy to benefices in the Church of England.)\r\n\r\nIn the towns women were members of various guilds and companies equally\r\nwith men, and were burgesses and freewomen. Not till 1832 was the word\r\n\"male\" inserted before \"persons\" in the charters of boroughs. \"Never before\r\nhas the phrase 'male persons' appeared in any statute of the realm. By this\r\nAct (the Reform Bill), therefore, women were technically disfranchised for\r\nthe first time in the history of the English Constitution. The privilege of\r\nabstention was converted into the penalty of exclusion.\"\r\n\r\nNO THEORY OF DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\nThe years of Simon of Montfort and Edward I., which saw the beginnings of a\r\nrepresentative national assembly, were not a time of theoretical discussion\r\non political rights. The English nation, indeed, has ever been averse from\r\npolitical theories. The notion of a carefully balanced constitution was\r\noutside the calculations of medieval statesmen, and the idea of political\r\ndemocracy was not included among their visions.\r\n\r\n\"Even the scholastic writers, amid their calculations of all possible\r\ncombinations of principles in theology and morals, well aware of the\r\ndifference between the 'rex politicus' who rules according to law, and the\r\ntyrant who rules without it, and of the characteristics of monarchy,\r\naristocracy, and democracy, with their respective corruptions, contented\r\nthemselves for the most part with balancing the spiritual and secular\r\npowers, and never broached the idea of a growth into political\r\nenfranchisement. Yet, in the long run, this has been the ideal towards\r\nwhich the healthy development of national life in Europe has constantly\r\ntended, only the steps towards it have not been taken to suit a\r\npreconceived theory.\"[32]\r\n\r\nEach step towards democracy has been taken \"to suit the convenience of\r\nparty or the necessities of kings, to induce the newly admitted classes to\r\ngive their money, to produce political contentment.\"\r\n\r\nThe only two principles that are apparent in the age-long struggles for\r\npolitical freedom in England, that are recognised and acknowledged, are:\r\n(1) That that which touches all shall be approved by all; (2) that\r\ngovernment rests on the consent of the governed. Over and over again these\r\ntwo principles may be seen at work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPOPULAR INSURRECTION IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nGENERAL RESULTS OF POPULAR RISINGS\r\n\r\nPopular insurrection has never been successful in England; a violent death\r\nand a traitor's doom have been the lot of every leader of the common people\r\nwho took up arms against the Government. The Civil War that brought Charles\r\nI. to the scaffold, and the Revolution that deposed James II. and set\r\nWilliam of Orange on the throne, were the work of country gentlemen and\r\nWhig statesmen, not of the labouring people.\r\n\r\nBut if England has never seen popular revolution triumphant and democracy\r\nset up by force of arms, the earlier centuries witnessed more than one\r\neffort to gain by open insurrection some measure of freedom for the working\r\npeople of the land.\r\n\r\nNo other way than violent resistance seemed possible to peasants and\r\nartisans in the twelfth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, if\r\ntheir wrongs were to be mitigated and their rulers to be called to account.\r\n\r\nLangton and Simon of Montfort had placed some check on the power of the\r\nCrown, had laid the foundations of political liberty, and marked the road\r\nto be travelled; but the lot of the labouring people remained unheeded and\r\nvoiceless in the councils of the nation. What could they do but take up\r\narms to end an intolerable oppression?\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FITZOSBERT, CALLED LONGBEARD, 1196\r\n\r\nThe first serious protest came from the London workmen in the reign of\r\nRichard I.; and FitzOsbert, known as Longbeard, was the spokesman of the\r\npopular discontent.\r\n\r\nThe King wanted money, chiefly for his crusades in Palestine. He had no\r\ninclination to personal government, and the business of ruling England was\r\nin the hands of Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, the justiciar or\r\nKing's lieutenant. Richard left England for Normandy in 1194, and returned\r\nno more. England to him was a country where money could be raised, a\r\nsubject-province to be bled by taxation. Archbishop Hubert did his best to\r\nsatisfy the royal demands; and though by his inquisitions \"England was\r\nreduced to poverty from one sea to the other\"--it is estimated that more\r\nthan £1,000,000 was sent to Richard in two years--the King was left\r\nunsatisfied. The nation generally came to hate the Archbishop's taxation,\r\nthe Church suffered by his neglect, and he was finally compelled to resign\r\nthe justiciarship.\r\n\r\nIt was the London rising, under FitzOsbert's leadership, that directly\r\ncaused Archbishop Hubert's retirement, and FitzOsbert is notable as the\r\nfirst of the long line of agitators.\r\n\r\nThe political importance of the capital was seen in the reigns of Cnut and\r\nWilliam the Conqueror. It was conspicuous on the arrival of Stephen in\r\n1135, and its influence on national politics lasted till the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century.[33]\r\n\r\nBy its charter London had the right of raising taxes for the Crown in its\r\nown way, and in 1196 the method proposed by the Corporation provoked the\r\noutbreak. \"When the aldermen assembled according to usage in full hustings\r\nfor the purpose of assessing the taxes, the rulers endeavoured to spare\r\ntheir own purses and to levy the whole from the poor\" (Hoveden).\r\n\r\nThe poorer citizens were voteless, and the plan of the aldermen was to levy\r\nthe tallages per head, and not in proportion to the property of the\r\ninhabitants. This meant, practically, that the whole, except a very small\r\nfraction of the sum to be raised, must be paid by the working people.\r\n\r\nThereupon FitzOsbert protested, and the people rose in arms against the\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nFitzOsbert was an old crusader, and he was something of a lawyer and a\r\npowerful speaker. Not a rich man by any means, FitzOsbert was yet a member\r\nof the city council when, \"burning with zeal for justice and fair play, he\r\nmade himself the champion of the poor.\" To his enemies he was a demagogue\r\nand disreputable--so Ralph de Diceto, Dean of St. Paul's at that time,\r\ndescribed him. To others of more popular sympathies he was heroic and died\r\na martyr's death. Across the centuries he is seen as \"an agitator\"--the\r\nfirst English agitator, the first man to stand up boldly against the\r\noppression of the common people. This palpably unjust taxation of the poor\r\nwas intolerable to FitzOsbert.\r\n\r\nFifteen thousand men banded themselves together in London under an oath\r\nthat they would stand by each other and by their leader; and FitzOsbert,\r\nafter a vain journey to Normandy to arouse Richard's attention to the\r\nwrongs of his subjects, bade open defiance to the justiciar and his\r\ntax-gatherers.\r\n\r\nFor a time the Archbishop's men were powerless, but weakness crept in\r\namongst the citizens, and the aldermen were naturally on the side of\r\nconstituted authority. FitzOsbert's success meant a readjustment of\r\ntaxation quite unpalatable to the City Fathers.\r\n\r\nIn the end FitzOsbert was deserted by all but a handful of his followers\r\nand fled with them for sanctuary to the church of St. Mary-le-Bow in\r\nCheapside. Pursued by the officers of the law, FitzOsbert climbed up into\r\nthe tower of the church, and to fetch him down orders were given to set the\r\nchurch on fire. This was done, and the only chance of life that now\r\nremained for the rebels was to get out of the church and cut their way\r\nthrough the ranks of their enemies.\r\n\r\nAt the church door FitzOsbert was struck down, and his little company\r\nquickly overpowered.\r\n\r\nHeavily chained, and badly wounded, FitzOsbert was carried off to the\r\nTower, to be tried and sentenced to a traitor's death without delay.\r\n\r\nA few days later--it was just before Easter--FitzOsbert was stripped naked,\r\nand dragged at the tail of a horse over the rough streets of London to\r\nTyburn. He was dead before the place of execution was reached, but the\r\nbody, broken and mangled, was hung up in chains under the gallows elm all\r\nthe same; and nine of his companions were hanged with him.\r\n\r\nThe very people who had fallen away from their leader in the day of his\r\nneed now counted FitzOsbert for a saint, and pieces of his gibbet and of\r\nthe bloodstained earth underneath the tree were carried away and treasured\r\nas sacred relics. It was alleged that miracles were performed when these\r\nrelics were touched--so wide was now the popular reverence for the dead\r\nchampion of the poor.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Hubert put a stop to this devotion by ordering sermons to be\r\npreached on FitzOsbert's iniquities; and an alleged death-bed confession,\r\ncontaining an account of many evil deeds, was published. It is likely\r\nenough that an old crusader had plenty of sins to answer for, but\r\nFitzOsbert's one crime before the law was that he had taught the people of\r\nLondon to stand up and resist by force of arms the payment of taxes--taxes\r\nlevied with gross unfairness in popular judgment.\r\n\r\nThe monks of Canterbury, to whom the church of St. Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside\r\nbelonged, had long had their own quarrels with Archbishop Hubert, and on\r\nthis firing of their church, and the violation of sanctuary, they appealed\r\nto the King and the Pope--Innocent III.--that Hubert should give up his\r\npolitical work and attend exclusively to his duties as Archbishop. Both the\r\nPope and the great barons were against him, and in 1198 Archbishop Hubert\r\nwas compelled to resign the judiciarship.\r\n\r\nTHE PEASANT REVOLT AND ITS LEADERS, 1381\r\n\r\nThe great uprising of the peasants in 1381 was a very different matter from\r\nthe local insurrection made by FitzOsbert. Two centuries had passed, and in\r\nthose centuries the beginnings of representative government had been set up\r\nand some recognition of the rights of the peasantry had been admitted in\r\nthe Great Charter.\r\n\r\nThe Peasant Revolt was national. It was carefully prepared and skilfully\r\norganised, and its leaders were men of power and ability--men of character.\r\nIt was not only a definite protest against positive evils, but a vigorous\r\nattempt to create a new social order--to substitute a social democracy for\r\nfeudal government.[34]\r\n\r\nThe old feudal order had been widely upset by the Black Death in 1349, and\r\nthe further ravages of pestilence in 1361 and 1369. The heavy mortality\r\nleft many country districts bereft of labour, and landowners were compelled\r\nto offer higher wages if agriculture was to go on. In vain Parliament\r\npassed Statutes of Labourers to prevent the peasant from securing an\r\nadvance. These Acts of Parliament expressly forbade a rise in wages; the\r\nlandless man or woman was \"to serve the employer who shall require him to\r\ndo so, and take only the wages which were accustomed to be taken in the\r\nneighbourhood two years before the pestilence.\" The scarcity of labour\r\ndrove landowners to compete for the services of the labourer, in spite of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nDiscontent was rife in those years of social change. The Statutes of\r\nLabourers were ineffectual; but they galled the labourers and kept serfdom\r\nalive. The tenants had their grievance because they were obliged to give\r\nlabour-service to their lords. Freehold yeomen, town workmen, and\r\nshopkeepers were irritated by heavy taxation, and vexed by excessive market\r\ntolls. All the materials were at hand for open rebellion, and leaders were\r\nfound as the days went by to kindle and direct the revolt.\r\n\r\nJohn Ball, an itinerant priest, who came from St. Mary's, at York, and then\r\nmade Colchester the centre of his wanderings, spent twenty years organising\r\nthe revolt, and three times was excommunicated and imprisoned by the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury for teaching social \"errors, schisms, and\r\nscandals,\" but was in no wise contrite or cast down.\r\n\r\nChief of Ball's fellow-agitators were John Wraw, in Suffolk, Jack Straw, in\r\nEssex--both priests these--William Grindcobbe, in Hertford, and Geoffrey\r\nLitster, in Norfolk. In Kent lived Wat Tyler, of whom nothing is told till\r\nthe revolt was actually afire, but who at once was acknowledged leader and\r\ncaptain by the rebel hosts.\r\n\r\nFrom village to village went John Ball in the years that preceded the\r\nrising, organising the peasants into clubs, and stirring the people with\r\nrevolutionary talk. It was the way of this vagrant priest to preach to the\r\npeople on village greens, and his discourses were all on the same text--\"In\r\nthe beginning of the world there were no bondmen, all men were created\r\nequal.\"[35] Inequalities of wealth and social position were to be ended:\r\n\r\n\"Good people, things will never go well in England, so long as goods be not\r\nkept in common, and so long as there be villeins and gentlemen. By what\r\nright are they whom men call lords greater folk than we? If all come from\r\nthe same father and mother, Adam and Eve, how can they say or prove that\r\nthey are better than we, if it be not that they make us gain for them by\r\nour toil what they spend in their pride?\r\n\r\n\"They are clothed in velvet, and are warm in their furs and ermines, while\r\nwe are covered in rags. They have wine and spices and fair bread, and we\r\noatcake and straw, and water to drink. They have leisure and fine houses;\r\nwe have pain and labour, the wind and rain in the fields. And yet it is of\r\nus and of our toil that these men hold their state.\r\n\r\n\"We are called slaves; and if we do not perform our services, we are\r\nbeaten, and we have not any sovereign to whom we can complain, or who\r\nwishes to hear us and do us justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet, William Langland, in \"Piers Plowman,\" dwelt on the social wrongs\r\nof the time; Ball was fond of quoting from Langland, and of harping on a\r\nfamiliar couplet:\r\n\r\n  \"When Adam delved and Eve span,\r\n  Who was then the gentleman?\"\r\n\r\nBesides the sermons, some of the rhymed letters that John Ball sent about\r\nthe country have been preserved:\r\n\r\n    \"John Ball, Priest of St. Mary's, greets well all manner of men, and\r\n    bids them in the name of the Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, to\r\n    stand together manfully in truth. Help truth and truth shall help you.\r\n\r\n  \"John Ball greeteth you all,\r\n    And doth to understand he hath rung your bell.\r\n  Now with right and might, will and skill,\r\n    God speed every dell.\r\n\r\n  John the Miller asketh help to turn his mill right:\r\n    He hath ground small, small:\r\n    The King's Son of Heaven will pay for it all.\r\n  Look thy mill go right, with its four sails dight.\r\n\r\n  With right and with might, with skill and with will,\r\n    And let the post stand in steadfastness.\r\n  Let right help might, and skill go before will,\r\n    Then shall our mill go aright;\r\n  But if might go before right, and will go before skill,\r\n    Then is our mill mis-a-dight.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes it is under the signature of John Trueman that John Ball writes:\r\n\r\n  \"Beware ere ye be woe;\r\n  Know your friend from your foe;\r\n  Take enough and cry \"Ho!\"\r\n  And do well and better and flee from sin,\r\n  And seek out peace and dwell therein--\r\n    So biddeth John Trueman and all his fellows.\"\r\n\r\nA more definite note was struck when it seemed to Ball and his colleagues\r\nthat the time was ripe for revolution, and the word was given that appeal\r\nmust be made to the boy-king--Richard was only eleven years old when he\r\ncame to the throne in 1377.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go to the King, and remonstrate with him, telling him we must have\r\nit otherwise, or we ourselves shall find the remedy. He is young. If we\r\nwait on him in a body, all those who come under the name of serf, or are\r\nheld in bondage, will follow us in the hope of being free. When the King\r\nshall see us we shall obtain a favourable answer, or we must then ourselves\r\nseek to amend our condition.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter John Ball greets John Nameless, John the Miller, and John\r\nCarter, and bids them stand together in God's name, and beware of guile: he\r\nbids Piers Plowman \"go to his work and chastise well Hob the Robber (Sir\r\nRobert Hales, the King's Treasurer); and take with you John Trueman and all\r\nhis fellows, and look that you choose one head and no more.\"\r\n\r\nThese letters and the preaching were accepted by willing minds. John Ball\r\nwas in prison--in the jail of Archbishop Sudbury at Maidstone--in the\r\nspring of 1381, but the peasants were organised and ready to revolt. If Wat\r\nTyler is the recognised leader of the rebel forces--\"the one head\"--John\r\nBall's was the work of preparing the uprising. The vagrant priest had rung\r\nhis bell to some purpose. In every county, from Somerset to York, the\r\npeasants flocked together, \"some armed with clubs, rusty swords, axes, with\r\nold bows reddened by the smoke of the chimney corner, and odd arrows with\r\nonly one feather.\"\r\n\r\nAt Whitsuntide, early in June, 1381, the great uprising began--the Hurling\r\ntime of the peasants--long to be remembered with horror by the governing\r\nclasses. A badly ordered poll-tax was the match that kindled the fire.\r\n\r\nThe poll-tax was first levied, in 1377, on all over fourteen years of age.\r\nTwo years later it was graduated, every man and woman of the working class\r\nbeing rated at 4d., and dukes and archbishops at £6 13s. 4d. More money was\r\nstill wanted by the Government, and early in 1381, John of Gaunt, the chief\r\nman in the realm, called Parliament together at Northampton, and demanded\r\n£160,000. Parliament agreed that £100,000 should be raised, and the\r\nclergy--owning a third of the land--promised £60,000. But the only way of\r\nraising the £100,000 that the Government could think of was by another\r\npoll-tax, and this time everybody over fifteen was required to pay 1s. Of\r\ncourse, the thing was impossible. In many parishes the mere returns of\r\npopulation were not filled in; numbers evaded payment--which spelt ruin--by\r\nleaving their homes. £22,000 was all that came to hand.\r\n\r\nThen a man named John Legge came to the assistance of the Government, and\r\nwas appointed chief commissioner, and empowered to collect the tax.\r\n\r\nThe methods of Legge and his assistants provoked hostility, and when the\r\nvillagers of Fobbing, Corringham, and Stanford-le-Hope, in Essex, were\r\nsummoned to meet the commissioner at Brentwood, their reply was to kill the\r\ncollectors.\r\n\r\nThe Government answered this by sending down Chief Justice Belknap to\r\npunish the offenders, but the people drove the chief justice out of the\r\nplace, and Belknap was glad to escape with his life.\r\n\r\nThis was on Whit-Sunday, June 2nd, and two days later the revolt had spread\r\nto Kent; Gravesend and Dartford were in tumult. In one place Sir Simon\r\nBurley, a friend of Richard II., seized a workman, claiming him as a\r\nbondservant, and refusing to let him go under a fine of £300; while at\r\nDartford a tax-collector had made trouble by gross indecency to the wife\r\nand daughter of one John Tyler.[36]\r\n\r\nThereupon this John Tyler, \"being at work in the same town tyling of an\r\nhouse, when he heard thereof, caught his lathing staff in his hand, and ran\r\nreaking home; where, reasoning with the collector, who made him so bold,\r\nthe collector answered with stout words, and strake at the tyler; whereupon\r\nthe tyler, avoiding the blow, smote the collector with his lathing staff,\r\nso that the brains flew out of his head. Wherethrough great noise arose in\r\nthe streets, and the poor people being glad, everyone prepared to support\r\nthe said John Tyler.\"\r\n\r\nNow, with the fire of revolt in swift blaze, it was for the men of Kent to\r\nsee that it burned under some direction. Authority and discipline were\r\nessential if the rising was not to become mob rule or mere anarchy, and if\r\npositive and intolerable wrongs were to find remedies.\r\n\r\nAt Maidstone, on June 7th--after Rochester Castle had been stormed, its\r\nprisoners set free and Sir John Newton its governor placed in safe\r\ncustody--Wat Tyler was chosen captain of the rebel hosts.\r\n\r\nHistory tells us nothing of the antecedents of this remarkable man. For\r\neight days, and eight days only, he plays his part on the stage of national\r\nevents: commands with authority a vast concourse of men; meets the King\r\nface to face, and wrests from sovereignty great promises of reform; orders\r\nthe execution of the chief ministers of the Crown, and then, in what seems\r\nto be the hour of triumph, is struck to the ground, and goes to his death.\r\n\r\nUnder the accredited leadership of Wat Tyler the revolt at once took form.\r\nFive days were spent in Kent before the peasant army marched on London. The\r\nmanor houses were attacked, and all rent rolls, legal documents, lists of\r\ntenants and serfs destroyed. The rising was not a ferocious massacre like\r\nthe rising of the Jacquerie in France; there was no general massacre of\r\nlandlords, or reign of terror. The lawyers who managed the landowners'\r\nestates were the enemy, and against them--against the instruments of\r\nlandlord tyranny--was the anger of the peasants directed. In the same way\r\nJohn of Gaunt, and not the youthful King, was recognised as the evil\r\ninfluence in government; and while a vow was taken by the men of Kent that\r\nno man named \"John\" should be King of England, the popular cry was \"King\r\nRichard and the Commons,\" and all who joined in this were accounted friends\r\nof the insurgent populace.\r\n\r\nBlackheath was reached on the evening of June 12th, and early the following\r\nmorning, which was Corpus Christi Day, John Ball--released by a thousand\r\nhands from his prison at Maidstone--preached to the multitude on the work\r\nbefore them:\r\n\r\n\"Now is the opportunity given to Englishmen, if they do but choose to take\r\nit, of casting off the yoke they have borne so long, of winning the freedom\r\nthey have always desired. Wherefore, let us take good courage and behave\r\nlike the wise husbandman of scripture, who gathered the wheat into his\r\nbarn, but uprooted and burned the tares that had half-choked the good\r\ngrain. The tares of England are her oppressive rulers, and the time of\r\nharvest has come. Ours it is to pluck up these tares and make away with\r\nthem all--the wicked lords, the unjust judges, the lawyers--every man,\r\nindeed, who is dangerous to the common good. Then shall we all have peace\r\nin our time and security for the future. For when the great ones have been\r\nrooted up and cast away, all will enjoy equal freedom and nobility, rank\r\nand power shall we have in common.\"\r\n\r\nThirty-thousand men--yeomen, craftsmen, villeins, and peasants, were at\r\nBlackheath, and these were soon joined by thousands more from Surrey.\r\n\r\nJohn Wraw and Grindcobbe came to consult with Wat Tyler, and then returned\r\nto Suffolk and Hertford to announce that the hour had come to strike.\r\n\r\nThe Marshalsea and King's Bench prisons, and the houses of ill-fame that\r\nclustered round London Bridge, were destroyed before Wat Tyler led his army\r\ninto the city. An attempt to meet the King in conference was frustrated by\r\nthe royal counsellors. Richard came down in the royal barge as far as\r\nRotherhithe, but was dissuaded by Sir Robert Hales, and the Earls of\r\nSuffolk, Salisbury, and Warwick, from \"holding speech with the shoeless\r\nruffians.\"\r\n\r\nRichard rowed back swiftly to the Tower, and Tyler and his army swept into\r\nLondon. The city was in the hands of the rebel captain, but the citizens\r\nwelcomed the invaders, and offered bread and ale when Tyler proclaimed that\r\ndeath would be the instant punishment for theft.\r\n\r\nJohn of Gaunt's palace at the Savoy, on the river strand, was the first\r\nplace to be burnt; but Henry, Earl of Derby, John of Gaunt's son (eighteen\r\nyears later to reign as Henry IV., in place of Richard), was allowed to\r\npass out uninjured, and a wretched man caught in the act of stealing off\r\nwith a silver cup was promptly executed.\r\n\r\nThe Savoy destroyed, the Temple--a hive of lawyers--was the next to be\r\nburnt, and before nightfall the Fleet Prison and Newgate had been\r\ndemolished.\r\n\r\nAgain Tyler demanded conference with the King, and Richard, lying in the\r\nTower with his counsellors, unable to prevent the work of conference,\r\nboldly decided to come out and meet the rebels. Mile End was appointed for\r\nthe conference, and to Mile End Richard came with a very modest retinue.\r\nThe King was only fifteen, but he was the son of the Black Prince, and he\r\nhad both courage and cunning. He was fully aware that the people did not\r\nlay on him responsibility for the sins of the Government. \"If we measure\r\nintellectual power by the greatest exertion it ever displays, rather than\r\nby its average results, Richard II. was a man of considerable talents. He\r\npossessed along with much dissimulation a decisive promptitude in seizing\r\nthe critical moment for action.\"[37]\r\n\r\nAt Mile End Tyler stated the grievances of the people. But first he asked\r\nthat all traitors should be put to death, and to this the King agreed.\r\n\r\nFour positive articles of reform were put forward, and were at once\r\nassented to by the King:--\r\n\r\n1. A free and general pardon to all concerned in the rising.\r\n\r\n2. The total abolition of all villeinage (forced labour) and serfdom.\r\n\r\n3. An end to all tolls and market dues--\"freedom to buy and sell in all\r\ncities, burghs, mercantile towns, and other places within our kingdom of\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\n4. All customary tenants to become leaseholders at a fixed rental of\r\nfourpence an acre for ever.\r\n\r\nThat all doubts might be removed, thirty clerks were set to work on the\r\nspot to draw up charters of manumission, and banners were presented to each\r\ncounty. At nightfall thousands returned home convinced that the old order\r\nwas ended, and that the Royal charters were genuine assurances of freedom.\r\n\r\nBut Tyler and the bulk of the men of Kent and Surrey remained in the city.\r\nIt seemed to Wat Tyler that better terms still were to be wrung from the\r\nKing. It looked that night as though the insurrection had triumphed\r\ncompletely. Not only were the charters signed and the royal promises given,\r\nbut several in high office, whom Tyler held to be \"traitors,\" had gone to\r\ntheir doom. Sir Robert Hales, the Treasurer, Archbishop Sudbury, the\r\nChancellor--a gentle and kindly old man, \"lenient to heretics\"--John Legge,\r\nthe hated poll-tax commissioner, with Appleton, John of Gaunt's chaplain,\r\nand Richard Lyons, a thoroughly corrupt contractor of Edward III.'s reign,\r\nwere all dragged out of the Tower and beheaded on Tower Hill on Friday,\r\nJune 15th.\r\n\r\nOn Tyler's request for another conference with Richard on the following\r\nday, the King saw he had no choice but to yield. For the second time Wat\r\nTyler and Richard met face to face. The conference was held at Smithfield,\r\nin the square outside St. Bartholomew's Priory. The King and two hundred\r\nretainers, with Walworth the mayor, were on the east side of the square.\r\nTyler and his army were on the west side, opposite the Priory.\r\n\r\nIn the open space Tyler, mounted on a little horse, presented his demands;\r\nmore sweeping were the reforms now asked for than those of the previous\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Let no law but the law of Winchester[38] prevail throughout the land, and\r\nlet no man be made an outlaw by the decree of judges and lawyers. Grant\r\nalso that no lord shall henceforth exercise lordship over the commons; and\r\nsince we are oppressed by so vast a horde of bishops and clerks, let there\r\nbe but one bishop in England; and let the property and goods of Holy Church\r\nbe divided fairly according to the needs of the people in each parish,\r\nafter in justice making suitable provision for the present clergy and\r\nmonks. Finally, let there be no more villeins in England, but grant us all\r\nto be free and of one condition.\"\r\n\r\nRichard answered that he promised readily all that was asked, \"if only it\r\nbe consistent with the regality of my Crown.\" He then bade the commons\r\nreturn home, since their requests had been granted.\r\n\r\nNobles and counsellors stood in sullen and silent anger at the King's\r\nwords, but were powerless to act. Tyler, conscious of victory, called for a\r\ndraught, and when his attendant brought him a mighty tankard of ale, the\r\nrebel leader drank good-humouredly to \"King Richard and the Commons.\" A\r\nknight in the royal service, a \"valet of Kent,\" was heard to mutter that\r\nWat Tyler was the greatest thief and robber in all the county, and Tyler\r\ncaught the abusive words, drew his dagger, and made for the man.\r\n\r\nMayor Walworth, as angry as the nobles at the King's surrender, shouted\r\nthat he would arrest all who drew weapons in the King's presence; and on\r\nTyler striking at him impatiently, the Mayor drew a cutlass and slashed\r\nback, wounding Tyler in the neck so that he fell from his horse. Before he\r\ncould recover a footing, two knights plunged their swords into him, and\r\nTyler, mortally wounded, could only scramble on to his little horse, ride a\r\nyard or two, call on the commons to avenge him, and then drop--a dead\r\nman.[39]\r\n\r\nAnd with Wat Tyler's death the whole rebellion collapsed. Confusion fell\r\nupon the people at Smithfield. Some were for immediate attack, but when\r\nRichard, riding out into the middle of the square, claimed that he and not\r\nTyler was their King, and bade them follow him into the fields towards\r\nIslington, the great mass, convinced that Richard was honestly their\r\nfriend, obeyed. At nightfall they were scattered.\r\n\r\nWat Tyler's body was taken into the Priory, and his head placed on London\r\nBridge.\r\n\r\nWalworth hastily gathered troops together, and the leader of the rebels\r\nbeing dead, the nobles recovered their courage.\r\n\r\nThe rising was over; the people without leaders were as sheep for the\r\nslaughter. Jack Straw was taken in London and hanged without the formality\r\nof a trial; and on June 22nd Tresilian, the new chief justice, went on a\r\nspecial assize to try the rebels, and \"showed mercy to none and made great\r\nhavock.\" The King's charters and promises were declared null and void when\r\nParliament met, and some hundreds of peasants were hanged in various parts\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nJohn Ball and Grindcobbe were hanged at St. Albans on July 15th, John Wraw\r\nand Geoffrey Litster suffered the same fate.\r\n\r\nAll that Wat Tyler and the peasants had striven for was lost; but the\r\nrising was not quite in vain. For one thing, the poll-tax was stopped, and\r\nthe end of villeinage was hastened.\r\n\r\nThe great uprising was the first serious demonstration of the English\r\npeople for personal liberty. \"It taught the King's officers and gentle\r\nfolks that they must treat the peasants like men if they wished them to\r\nbehave quietly, and it led most landlords to set free their bondsmen, and\r\nto take fixed money payments instead of uncertain services from their\r\ncustomary tenants, so that in a hundred years' time there were very few\r\nbondsmen left in England.\"[40]\r\n\r\nJACK CADE, CAPTAIN OF KENT, 1450\r\n\r\nTo understand the character and importance of the rising of the men of Kent\r\nunder Jack Cade in 1450, the first thing to be done is to clear the mind of\r\nShakespeare's travesty in _King Henry VI._, Part 2. In the play the name of\r\nCade has been handed down in obloquy, and all that he and his followers\r\naimed at caricatured out of recognition. The part that Jack Cade really\r\nplayed in national affairs has no likeness to the low comedy performance\r\nimagined by Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nIt was a popular rising in 1450, but it was not a peasant revolt. Men of\r\nsubstance in the county rallied to Cade's banner, and in many parishes in\r\nKent the village constable was employed to enrol willing recruits in the\r\narmy of disaffection.[41]\r\n\r\nThe peasant revolt was at bottom a social movement, fostered and fashioned\r\nby preachers of a social democracy. Cade's rising was provoked by\r\nmisgovernment and directed at political reform. It was far less\r\nrevolutionary in purpose than the revolt that preceded it, or the rising\r\nunder Ket a hundred years later.\r\n\r\nThe discontent was general when Cade encamped on Blackheath with the\r\ncommons of Kent at the end of May, 1450. Suffolk, the best hated of Henry\r\nVI.'s ministers, had already been put to death by the sailors of Dover, and\r\nLord Say-and-Sele, the Treasurer, was in the Tower under impeachment.\r\nAyscough, Bishop of Salisbury, another Minister, was hanged by his\r\ninfuriated flock in Wiltshire, and Bishop Moleyns, of Chichester, Keeper of\r\nthe Privy Seal, was executed in Portsmouth by a mob of sailors. Piracy\r\nprevailed unchecked in the English Channel, and the highways inland were\r\nhaunted by robbers--soldiers back from France and broken in the wars.\r\n\r\nThe ablest statesman of the day, the Duke of York, was banished from the\r\nroyal council, and there was a wide feeling that an improvement in\r\ngovernment was impossible until York was recalled.\r\n\r\nWhether Cade, who was known popularly as \"Mortimer,\" was related to the\r\nDuke of York, or was merely a country landowner, can never be decided. The\r\ncharges made against him after his death were not supported by a shred of\r\nevidence, but it was necessary then for the Government to blacken the\r\ncharacter of the Captain of Kent for the utter discouragement of his\r\nfollowers. All we _know_ of Cade is that by the Act of Attainder he must\r\nhave been a man of some property in Surrey--probably a squire or yeoman.\r\n\r\nThe army that encamped on Blackheath numbered over 40,000, and included\r\nsquires, yeomen, county gentlemen, and at least two notable ecclesiastics\r\nfrom Sussex, the Abbot of Battle and the Prior of Lewes. The testimony to\r\nCade's character is that he was the unquestioned and warmly respected\r\nleader of the host. The Cade depicted by his enemies--a dissolute,\r\ndisreputable ruffian--was not the kind of man to have had authority as a\r\nchosen captain over country gentlemen and clerical landowners in the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe \"Complaints\" of the commons of Kent, drawn up at Blackheath and\r\nforwarded to the King and his Parliament, then sitting at Westminster,\r\ncalled attention in fifteen articles to the evils that afflicted the land.\r\nThese articles dealt with a royal threat to lay waste Kent in revenge for\r\nthe death of the Duke of Suffolk; the wasting of the royal revenue raised\r\nby heavy taxation; the banishment of the Duke of York--\"to make room for\r\nunworthy ministers who would not do justice by law, but demanded bribes and\r\ngifts\"; purveyance of goods for the royal household without payment; arrest\r\nand imprisonment on false charges of treason by persons whose goods and\r\nlands were subsequently seized by the King's servants, who then \"either\r\ncompassed their deaths or kept them in prison while they got possession of\r\ntheir property by royal grant\"; interference by \"the great rulers of the\r\nland\" with the old right of free election of knights of the shire; the\r\nmismanagement of the war in France. A certain number of purely local\r\ngrievances, chiefly concerned with the maladministration of justice, were\r\nalso included in the \"Complaints,\" and five \"Requests\"--including the\r\nabolition of the Statutes of Labourers--were added.\r\n\r\nHenry and his counsellors dismissed these \"Complaints\" with contempt. \"Such\r\nproud rebels,\" it was said, \"should rather be suppressed and tamed with\r\nviolence and force than with fair words or amicable answer.\" But when the\r\nroyal troops moved into Kent to disperse the rising, Cade's army cut them\r\nto pieces at Sevenoaks. Henry returned to London; his nobles rode away to\r\ntheir country houses; and after a fruitless attempt at negotiations by the\r\nDuke of Buckingham and the Archbishop of Canterbury,[42] the King himself\r\nfled to Kenilworth--leaving London at the mercy of the Captain of Kent.\r\n\r\nOn July 2nd Cade crossed London Bridge on horseback, followed by all his\r\narmy. The Corporation had already decided to offer no opposition to his\r\nentry, and one of its members, Thomas Cocke, of the Drapers' Company--later\r\nsheriff and M.P.--had gone freely between the camp at Blackheath and the\r\ncity, acting as mutual friend to the rebels and the citizens. All that Cade\r\nrequired was that the foreign merchants in London should furnish him with a\r\ncertain number of arms and horses, \"and 1,000 marks of ready money\"; and\r\nthis was done. \"So that it was found that the Captain and Kentishmen at\r\ntheir being in the city did no hurt to any stranger.\"[43]\r\n\r\nOn the old London stone, in Cannon Street, Cade laid his sword, in the\r\npresence of the Mayor and a great multitude of people, and declared\r\nproudly: \"Now is Mortimer lord of this city.\" Then at nightfall he went\r\nback to his headquarters at the White Hart Inn in Southwark.\r\n\r\nThe following day Lord Say-and-Sele, and his son-in-law, Crowmer, Sheriff\r\nof Kent, were removed by Cade's orders from the Tower to the Guildhall,\r\ntried for \"divers treasons\" and \"certain extortions,\" and quickly beheaded.\r\nPopular hatred, not content with this, placed the heads of the fallen\r\nminister and his son-in-law on poles, made them kiss in horrible embrace,\r\nand then bore them off in triumph to London Bridge.\r\n\r\nA third man, one John Bailey, was also hanged for being a necromancer; and\r\nas Cade had promised death to all in his army convicted of theft, it fell\r\nout that certain \"lawless men\" paid the penalty for disobedience, and were\r\nhanged in Southwark--where the main body of the army lay.\r\n\r\nCade's difficulties began directly after Lord Say-and-Sele's execution.\r\nLondon assented willingly to the death of an unpopular statesman, but had\r\nno mind to provision an army of 50,000 men, and, indeed, had no liking for\r\nthe proximity of such a host. Plunder being forbidden, and strict\r\ndiscipline the rule, the urgent question for the Captain of Kent was how\r\nthe army was to be maintained.\r\n\r\nGetting no voluntary help from the city. Cade decided that he must help\r\nhimself. He supped with a worthy citizen named Curtis in Tower Street on\r\nJuly 4th, and insisted before he left that Curtis must contribute money for\r\nthe support of the Kentish men. Curtis complied--how much he gave we know\r\nnot--but he resented bitterly the demand, and he told the tale of his\r\nwrongs to his fellow-merchants.[44] The result was that while Cade slept in\r\npeace as usual at the White Hart, the Mayor and Corporation took counsel\r\nwith Lord Scales, the Governor of the Tower, and resolved that at all costs\r\nthe Captain of Kent and his forces must be kept out of the city. After the\r\ntreatment of Curtis the fear was that disorder and pillage might become\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Sunday, July 5th, and all through the night battle waged\r\nhotly on London Bridge, which had been seized and fortified before Cade was\r\nawake, and by the morning the rebels, unsuccessful in their attack, were\r\nglad to agree to a hasty truce.\r\n\r\nThe truce gave opportunity to Cardinal Kemp, Archbishop of York, the King's\r\nChancellor, to suggest a lasting peace to Cade. Messengers were sent\r\nspeedily from the Tower, where Kemp, with Archbishop Stafford, of\r\nCanterbury, had stayed in safety, to the White Hart, urging a conference\r\n\"to the end that the civil commotions and disturbances might cease and\r\ntranquillity be restored.\"\r\n\r\nCade consented, and when the two Archbishops, with William Waynfleet,\r\nBishop of Winchester, met the Captain of Kent in the Church of St.\r\nMargaret, Southwark, and promised that Parliament should give consideration\r\nto the \"Complaints\" and \"Requests\" of the commons, and that a full pardon\r\nshould be given to all who would straightway return home, the rising was at\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nCade hesitated, and asked for the endorsement of the pardons by Parliament;\r\nbut this was plainly impossible because Parliament was not sitting. The\r\nbulk of the commons were satisfied with their pardons, and with the promise\r\nthat Parliament would attend to their grievances. There was nothing to be\r\ngained, it seemed, by remaining in arms. On July 8th, the rebel army had\r\nbroken up, taking the road back to the towns and villages, farms and\r\ncottages in Kent, Sussex, and Surrey. Cade, with a small band of followers,\r\nretreated to Rochester, and attempted without success, the capture of\r\nQueenborough Castle. On the news that the commons had dispersed from\r\nSouthwark, the Government at once took the offensive. Alexander Iden was\r\nappointed Sheriff of Kent, and, marrying Crowmer's widow, subsequently\r\ngained considerable profit. Within a week John Cade was proclaimed by the\r\nKing's writ a false traitor throughout the countryside, and Sheriff Iden\r\nwas in eager pursuit--for a reward of 1,000 marks awaited the person who\r\nshould take Cade, alive or dead.\r\n\r\nNear Heathfield, in Sussex, Cade, broken and famished, was found by Iden,\r\nand fought his last fight on July 13th, preferring to die sword in hand\r\nthan to perish by the hangman. He fell before the overwhelming odds of the\r\nsheriff and his troops, and the body was immediately sent off to London for\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nThe landlady of the White Hart proved the identity of the dead captain, and\r\nall that remained was to stick the head on London Bridge, and dispatch the\r\nquartered body to Blackheath, Norwich, Salisbury and Gloucester for public\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\nIden got the 1,000 marks reward and, in addition, the governorship of\r\nRochester Castle at a salary of £36 a year.\r\n\r\nBy special Act of Attainder all Cade's goods, lands and tenements were made\r\nforfeit to the Crown, and statements were published for the discrediting of\r\nCade's life.\r\n\r\nNo allusion was made in Parliament to the \"Complaints\" and \"Requests,\" and,\r\nin spite of Cardinal Kemp's pardons, a number of men were hanged at\r\nCanterbury and Rochester for their share in the rising, when Henry VI. and\r\nhis justices visited Kent in January, 1451.\r\n\r\nThe revolt failed to amend the wretched misrule. It remained for civil war\r\nto drive Henry VI. from the throne, and make Edward IV. of York his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nTHE NORFOLK RISING UNDER ROBERT KET, 1549\r\n\r\nA century after the rising of the commons of Kent came the last great\r\npopular rebellion--the Norfolk Rising, led by Ket. This insurrection was\r\nagrarian and social, concerned neither with the fierce theological\r\ndifferences of the time, nor with the political rivalries of Protector\r\nSomerset and his enemies in Edward VI.'s Council.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century England was in the main a nation\r\nof small farmers, but radical changes were taking place, and these changes\r\nmeant ruin to thousands of yeomen and peasants.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure, by many large landowners, of the fields which for ages past\r\nhad been cultivated by the country people, the turning of arable land into\r\npasture, were the main causes of the distress.[45] Whole parishes were\r\nevicted in some places and dwelling houses destroyed, and contemporary\r\nwriters are full of the miseries caused by these clearances.\r\n\r\nActs of Parliament were passed in 1489 and 1515, prohibiting the \"pulling\r\ndown of towns,\" and ordering the reversion of pasture lands to tillage, but\r\nthe legislation was ignored. Sir Thomas More, in his \"Utopia\" (1516),\r\ndescribed very vividly what the enclosures were doing to rural England; and\r\na royal commission, appointed by Cardinal Wolsey, reported in the following\r\nyear that more than 36,000 acres had been enclosed in seven Midland\r\ncounties. In some cases, waste lands only were enclosed, but landowners\r\nwere ordered to make restitution within forty days where small occupiers\r\nhad been dispossessed. Royal commissions and royal proclamations were no\r\nmore effective than Acts of Parliament. Bad harvests drove the Norfolk\r\npeasantry to riot for food in 1527 and 1529. The dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries in 1536 and 1539 abolished a great source of charity for the\r\nneedy, and increased the social disorder. Finally, in 1547, came the\r\nconfiscation by the Crown of the property of the guilds and brotherhoods,\r\nand the result of this enactment can only be realised by supposing the\r\nfunds of friendly societies, trade unions, and co-operative societies taken\r\nby Government to-day without compensation.\r\n\r\nAll that Parliament would do in the face of the starvation and unemployment\r\nthat brooded over many parts of England, was to pass penal legislation for\r\nthe homeless and workless--so that it seemed to many that Government had\r\ngot rid of Papal authority only to bring back slavery. The agrarian misery,\r\nthe violent changes in the order of church services and social customs, the\r\nconfiscation of the funds of the guilds, and the wanton spoiling of the\r\nparish churches[46]--all these things drove the people to revolt.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1549 the men of Devon and Cornwall took up arms for \"the old\r\nreligion,\" and were hanged by scores. In Norfolk that same year the rising\r\nunder Ket was social, and unconcerned with religion. Lesser agrarian\r\ndisturbances took place in Somerset, Lincoln, Essex, Kent, Oxford, Wilts,\r\nand Buckingham. But there was no cohesion amongst the insurgents, and no\r\norganisation of the peasants such as England had seen under John Ball and\r\nhis companion in 1381.\r\n\r\nIn 1548 Somerset, the Lord Protector, made an honest attempt to check the\r\nrapacity of the landowners, but his proclamation and royal commission were\r\nno more successful than Wolsey's had been, and only earned for the\r\nProtector the hatred of the landowners.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk Rising was the one strong movement to turn the current that was\r\nsweeping the peasants into destitution. It failed, as all popular\r\ninsurrection in England has failed, and it brought its leaders to the\r\ngallows; but for six weeks hope lifted its head in the rebel camp outside\r\nNorwich, and many believed that oppression and misery were to end.\r\n\r\nThe rising began at Attleborough, on June 20th, when the people pulled down\r\nthe fences and hedges set up round the common fields. On July 7th, at the\r\nannual feast in honour of St. Thomas of Canterbury, at Wymondham, a mighty\r\nconcourse of people broke down the fences at Hetherset, and then appealed\r\nto Robert Ket and his brother to help them.\r\n\r\nBoth the Kets were well-known locally. They were men of old family,\r\ncraftsmen, and landowners. Robert was a tanner by trade, William a butcher.\r\nThree manors--valued at 1,000 marks, with a yearly income of £50--belonged\r\nto Robert Ket: church lands mostly, leased from the Earl of Warwick.\r\n\r\nKet saw that only under leadership and guidance could the revolt become a\r\nrevolution, and he threw himself into the cause of his poorer neighbours\r\nwith whole-hearted fervour. \"I am ready,\" he said, \"and will be ready at\r\nall times to do whatever, not only to repress, but to subdue the power of\r\ngreat men. Whatsoever lands I have enclosed shall again be made common unto\r\nye and all men, and my own hands shall first perform it. You shall have me,\r\nif you will, not only as a companion, but as a captain; and in the doing of\r\nthe so great a work before us, not only as a fellow, but for a leader,\r\nauthor, and principal.\"\r\n\r\nKet's leadership was at once acclaimed with enthusiasm by the thousand men\r\nwho formed the rebel band at the beginning of the rising. The news spread\r\nquickly that Ket was leading an army to Norwich, and on July 10th, when a\r\ncamp was made at Eaton Wood, every hour brought fresh recruits. It is clear\r\nfrom Ket's speeches, and from \"The Rebels' Complaint,\" issued by him at\r\nthis time, that the aim of the leaders of the Norfolk Rising was not merely\r\nto stop the enclosures, but to end the ascendancy of the landlord class for\r\nall time, and to set up a social democracy.\r\n\r\nKet's address at Eaton Wood was revolutionary:\r\n\r\n\"Now are ye overtopped and trodden down by gentlemen, and put out of\r\npossibility ever to recover foot. Rivers of riches run into the coffers of\r\nyour landlords, while you are par'd to the quick, and fed upon pease and\r\noats like beasts. You are fleeced by these landlords for their private\r\nbenefit, and as well kept under by the public burdens of State, wherein\r\nwhile the richer sort favour themselves, ye are gnawn to the very bones.\r\nYour tyrannous masters often implead, arrest, and cast you into prison, so\r\nthat they may the more terrify and torture you in your minds, and wind your\r\nnecks more surely under their arms.... Harmless counsels are fit for tame\r\nfools; for you who have already stirred, there is no hope but in\r\nadventuring boldly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Rebels' Complaint\" is equally definite and outspoken. It rehearsed the\r\nwrongs of a landless peasantry, and called on the people to end these\r\nwrongs by open rebellion. The note of social equality is struck by Ket\r\nthroughout the rising.\r\n\r\n\"The present condition of possessing land seemeth miserable and\r\nslavish--holding it all at the pleasure of great men; not freely, but by\r\nprescription, and, as it were, at the will and pleasure of the lord. For as\r\nsoon as any man offend any of these gorgeous gentlemen, he is put out,\r\ndeprived, and thrust from all his goods.\r\n\r\n\"The common pastures left by our predecessors for our relief and our\r\nchildren are taken away.\r\n\r\n\"The lands which in the memory of our fathers were common, those are\r\nditched and hedged in and made several; the pastures are enclosed, and we\r\nshut out.\r\n\r\n\"We can no longer bear so much, so great, and so cruel injury; neither can\r\nwe with quiet minds behold so great covetousness, excess, and pride of the\r\nnobility. We will rather take arms, and mix Heaven and earth together, than\r\nendure so great cruelty.\r\n\r\n\"Nature hath provided for us, as well as for them; hath given us a body and\r\na soul, and hath not envied us other things. While we have the same form,\r\nand the same condition of birth together with them, why should they have a\r\nlife so unlike unto ours, and differ so far from us in calling?\r\n\r\n\"We see that things have now come to extremities, and we will prove the\r\nextremity. We will rend down hedges, fill up ditches, and make a way for\r\nevery man into the common pasture. Finally, we will lay all even with the\r\nground, which they, no less wickedly than cruelly and covetously, have\r\nenclosed.\r\n\r\n\"We desire liberty and an indifferent (or equal) use of all things. This\r\nwill we have. Otherwise these tumults and our lives shall only be ended\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nBut though the method was revolution and the goal social democracy, Ket was\r\nno anarchist. He proved himself a strong, capable leader, able to enforce\r\ndiscipline and maintain law and order in the rebel camp. And with all his\r\npassionate hatred against the rule of the landlord, Ket would allow neither\r\nmassacre nor murder. There is no evidence that the life of a single\r\nlandowner was taken while the rising lasted, though many were brought\r\ncaptive to Ket's judgment seat.\r\n\r\nKet was equally averse from civil war between the citizens of Norwich and\r\nthe peasants. When the Mayor of Norwich, Thomas Cod, refused to allow Ket's\r\narmy to cross the city on its way to Mousehold Heath, where the permanent\r\ncamp was to be made, Ket simply led his forces round by Hailsdon and\r\nDrayton, and so reached Mousehold on July 12th without bloodshed. A week\r\nlater, and 20,000 was the number enrolled under the banner of revolt--for\r\nthe publication of \"The Rebels' Complaint\" and the ringing of bells and\r\nfiring of beacons roused all the countryside to action.\r\n\r\nOn Mousehold Heath, Robert Ket, with his brother William, gave directions\r\nand administered justice under a great tree, called the Oak of Reformation.\r\nMayor Cod, and two other respected Norwich citizens, Aldrich, an alderman,\r\nand Watson, a preacher, joined Ket's council, thinking their influence\r\nmight restrain the rebels from worse doings.\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine \"Requests and Demands,\" signed by Ket, Cod, and Aldrich, were\r\ndispatched to the King from Mousehold, and this document gave in full the\r\ngrievances of the rebels. The chief demands were the cessation of\r\nenclosures, the enactment of fair rents, the restoration of common fishing\r\nrights, the appointment of resident clergymen to preach and instruct the\r\nchildren, and the free election or appointment of local \"commissioners\" for\r\nthe enforcement of the laws. There was also a request \"that all bond men\r\nmay be made free, for God made all free with His precious bloodshedding.\"\r\n\r\nThe only answer to the \"Requests and Demands\" was the arrival of a herald\r\nwith a promise that Parliament would meet in October to consider the\r\ngrievances, if the people would in the meantime quietly return to their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nBut this Ket would by no means agree to, and for the next few weeks his\r\nauthority was supreme in that part of the country. He established a rough\r\nconstitution for the prevention of mere disorder, two men being chosen by\r\ntheir fellows from the various hundreds of the eastern half of the county.\r\nA royal messenger, bearing commissions of the peace to certain country\r\ngentlemen, falling into the hands of Ket, was relieved of his documents and\r\ndismissed. Ket then put in these commissions the names of men who had\r\njoined the rising, and declared them magistrates with authority to check\r\nall disobedience to orders.\r\n\r\nTo feed the army at Mousehold, men were sent out with a warrant from Ket\r\nfor obtaining cattle and corn from the country houses, and \"to beware of\r\nrobbing, spoiling, and other evil demeanours.\" No violence or injury was to\r\nbe done to \"any honest or poor man.\" Contributions came in from the smaller\r\nyeomen \"with much private good-will,\" but the landowners generally were\r\nstricken with panic, and let the rebels do what they liked. Those who could\r\nnot escape by flight were, for the most part, brought captive to the Oak of\r\nReformation, and thence sent to the prisons in Norwich and St. Leonard's\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nRelations between Ket and the Norwich authorities soon became strained to\r\nbreaking point. Mayor Cod was shocked at the imprisonment of county\r\ngentlemen, and refused permission for Ket's troops to pass through the city\r\non their foraging expeditions. Citizens and rebels were in conflict on July\r\n21st, but \"for lack of powder and want of skill in the gunners\" few lives\r\nwere lost, and Norwich was in the hands of Ket the following day. No\r\nreprisals followed; but a week later came William Parr, Marquis of\r\nNorthampton--Henry VIII.'s brother-in-law--with 1,500 Italian mercenaries\r\nand a body of country squires, to destroy the rebels. Northampton's forces\r\nwere routed utterly, and Lord Sheffield was slain, and many houses and\r\ngates were burnt in the city.\r\n\r\nThen for three weeks longer Robert Ket remained in power, still hoping\r\nagainst hope that some attention would be given by the Government to his\r\n\"Requests and Demands.\" Protector Somerset, beset by his own difficulties,\r\ncould do nothing for rebellious peasants, could not countenance in any way\r\nan armed revolt, however great the miseries that provoked insurrection.\r\nThe Earl of Warwick was dispatched with 14,000 troops to end the\r\nrebellion, and arrived on August 24th. For two days the issue seemed\r\nuncertain--half the city only was in Warwick's hands. The arrival of 1,400\r\nmercenaries--\"lanzknechts,\" Germans mostly--and a fatal decision of the\r\nrebels to leave their vantage ground at Mousehold Heath and do battle in\r\nthe open valley that stretched towards the city, gave complete victory to\r\nWarwick.\r\n\r\nThe peasants poured into the meadows beyond Magdalen and Pockthorpe gates,\r\nand were cut to pieces by the professional soldiers.\r\n\r\nWhen all seemed over Ket galloped away to the north, but was taken, worn\r\nout, at the village of Swannington, eight miles from Norwich.\r\n\r\nMore than 400 peasants were hanged by Warwick's orders, and their bodies\r\nleft to swing on Mousehold and in the city. Robert Ket and William Ket were\r\nsent to London, and after being tried and condemned for high treason, were\r\nreturned to Norwich in December for execution. Robert Ket was hanged in\r\nchains from Norwich Castle, and William suffered in similar fashion from\r\nthe parish church at Wymondham--to remind all people of the fate that\r\nbefall those who venture, unsuccessfully, to take up arms against the\r\ngovernment in power.\r\n\r\nSo the Norfolk Rising ended, and with it ended all serious popular\r\ninsurrection in England. Riots and mob violence have been seen even to our\r\nown time, but no great, well-organised movement to overthrow authority and\r\nestablish a social democracy by force of arms has been attempted since\r\n1549.\r\n\r\nThe characters of Robert Ket and his brother have been vindicated by time,\r\nand the rebel leader is now recognised as a disinterested, capable,\r\nhigh-minded man. Ket took what seemed to him the only possible course to\r\navert the doom of a ruined peasantry, and failed. But his courage and\r\nhumaneness are beyond question.[47]\r\n\r\nThe enclosures did not end with the sixteenth century, and for another one\r\nhundred years complaints are heard of the steady depopulation of rural\r\nEngland. In the eighteenth century came the second great series of\r\nenclosures--the enclosing of the commons and waste spaces, by Acts of\r\nParliament. Between 1710 and 1867 no less than 7,660,439 acres were thus\r\nenclosed.\r\n\r\nTo-day the questions of land tenure and land ownership are conspicuous\r\nitems in the discussion of the whole social question, for the relations of\r\na people to its land are of very first importance in a democratic state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE RENEWED AGAINST THE CROWN\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENT UNDER THE TUDORS\r\n\r\nThe English Parliament throughout the sixteenth century was but a servile\r\ninstrument of the Crown. The great barons were dead. Henry VIII. put to\r\ndeath Sir Thomas More and all who questioned the royal absolutism.\r\nElizabeth, equally despotic, had by good fortune the services of the first\r\ngeneration of professional statesmen that England produced. These\r\nstatesmen--Burleigh, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir Thomas\r\nSmith, and Sir Francis Walsingham--all died in office. Burleigh was\r\nminister for forty years, Bacon and Mildmay for more than twenty, and Smith\r\nand Walsingham for eighteen years.[48]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JOHN ELIOT]\r\n\r\nParliament was not only intimidated by Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, its\r\nmembership was recruited by nominees of the Crown.[49] And then it is also\r\nto be borne in mind that both Henry and Elizabeth made a point of getting\r\nParliament to do their will. They governed through Parliament, and ruled\r\ntriumphantly, for it is only in the later years of Elizabeth that any\r\ndiscontent is heard. The Stuarts, far less tyrannical, came to grief just\r\nbecause they never understood the importance of Parliament in the eyes of\r\nEnglishmen in the middle ranks, and attempted to rule while ignoring the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nElizabeth scolded her Parliaments, and more than once called the Speaker of\r\nthe House of Commons to account. The business of Tudor Parliaments was to\r\ndecree the proposals of the Crown. \"Liberty of speech was granted in\r\nrespect of the aye or no, but not that everybody should speak what he\r\nlisted.\" Bacon declared, \"the Queen hath both enlarging and restraining\r\npower; she may set at liberty things restrained by statute and may restrain\r\nthings which be at liberty.\"\r\n\r\nYet Elizabeth raised no objection to the theory that Parliament was the\r\nsovereign power, for her authority controlled Parliament; and so we have\r\nSir Thomas Smith writing in 1589 that \"the most high and absolute power of\r\nthe realm of England consisteth in the Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nIn his \"Ecclesiastical Polity,\" Book I. (1592-3), Hooker argues that \"Laws\r\nhuman, of what kind soever are available by consent,\" and that \"laws they\r\nare not which public approbation hath not made so\"; deciding explicitly\r\nthat sovereignty rests ultimately in the people.\r\n\r\nVICTORY OF PARLIAMENT OVER THE STUARTS\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the throne in 1603, James I. was prepared to govern with\r\nall the Tudor absolutism, but he had neither Elizabeth's Ministers--Cecil\r\nexcepted--nor her knowledge of the English mind. The English Parliament and\r\nthe English people had put up with Elizabeth's headstrong, capricious rule,\r\nbecause it had been a strong rule, and the nation had obviously thriven\r\nunder it.[50] But it was another matter altogether when James I. was king.\r\n\r\n\"By many steps the slavish Parliament of Henry VIII. grew into the\r\nmurmuring Parliament of Queen Elizabeth, the mutinous Parliament of James\r\nI., and the rebellious Parliament of Charles I.\"\r\n\r\nThe twenty years of James I.'s reign saw the preaching up of the doctrine\r\nof the divine right of kings by the bishops of the Established Church, and\r\nthe growing resolution of the Commons to revive their earlier rights and\r\nprivileges. If the Stuarts were as unfortunate in their choice of Ministers\r\nas Elizabeth had been successful, the House of Commons was equally happy in\r\nthe remarkable men who became its spokesmen and leaders. In the years that\r\npreceded the Civil War--1626-42--three men are conspicuous on the\r\nParliamentary side: Eliot, Hampden, and Pym. All three were country\r\ngentlemen, of good estate, high principle, and religious\r\nconvictions[51]--men of courage and resolution, and of blameless personal\r\ncharacter. Eliot died in prison, in the cause of good government, in 1632;\r\nHampden fell on Chalgrove Field in 1643.\r\n\r\nAs in earlier centuries the struggle in the seventeenth century between the\r\nKing and the Commons turned mainly on the questions of taxation. (At the\r\nsame time an additional cause of dispute can be found in the religious\r\ndifferences between Charles I. and the Parliamentarians. The latter were\r\nmainly Puritan, accepting the Protestantism of the Church of England, but\r\nhating Catholicism and the high-church views of Laud. The King was in full\r\nsympathy with high Anglicanism, and, like his father, willing to relax the\r\npenal laws against Catholics.)\r\n\r\n\"By the ancient laws and liberties of England it is the known birthright\r\nand inheritance of the subject that no tax, tallage, or other charge shall\r\nbe levied or imposed but by common consent in England, and that the\r\nsubsidies of tonnage and poundage are no way due or payable but by a free\r\ngift and special Act of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nIn these memorable words began the declaration moved by Sir John Eliot in\r\nthe House of Commons on March 2nd, 1629. A royal message ordering the\r\nadjournment of the House was disregarded, the Speaker was held down in his\r\nchair, and the key of the House of Commons was turned against intrusion,\r\nwhile Eliot's resolutions, declaring that the privileges of the Commons\r\nmust be preserved, were carried with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nCharles answered these resolutions by dissolving Parliament and sending\r\nEliot to the Tower.\r\n\r\nFor eleven years no Parliament was summoned. Eliot refused altogether to\r\nmake any defence for his Parliamentary conduct. \"I hold that it is against\r\nthe privilege of Parliament to speak of anything which is done in the\r\nHouse,\" was his reply to the Crown lawyers. So Sir John Eliot was left in\r\nprison, for nothing would induce this devoted believer in representative\r\ngovernment to yield to the royal pressure, and three years later, at the\r\nage of forty-two, he died in the Tower.\r\n\r\nIt was for the liberties of the House of Commons that Eliot gave his life.\r\nWasted with sickness, health and freedom were his if he would but\r\nacknowledge the right of the Crown to restrain the freedom of Parliamentary\r\ndebate; but such an acknowledgment was impossible from Sir John Eliot. For\r\nhim the privilege of the House of Commons in the matter of free speech was\r\na sacred cause, to be upheld by Members of Parliament, even to the death--a\r\ncause every whit as sacred to Eliot as the divine right of kings was to the\r\nStuart bishops.\r\n\r\nCharles hoped to govern England through his Ministers without interference\r\nfrom the Commons, and only the need of money compelled him to summon\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nJohn Hampden saw that if the King could raise money by forced loans and\r\nother exactions, the days of constitutional government were over. Hence his\r\nmemorable resistance to ship-money. London and the seaports were induced to\r\nprovide supplies for ships in 1634, on the pretext that piracy must be\r\nprevented. In the following year the demand was extended to the inland\r\ncounties, and Hampden refused point blank to pay--though the amount was\r\nonly a matter of 20s.--falling back, in justification of his refusal, on\r\nthe Petition of Right--acknowledged by Charles in 1628--which declared that\r\ntaxes were not to be levied without the consent of Parliament. The case was\r\ndecided in 1636, and five of the twelve judges held that Hampden's\r\nobjection was valid. The arguments in favour of non-payment were circulated\r\nfar and wide, so that, in spite of the adverse verdict, \"the judgment\r\nproved of more advantage and credit to the gentleman condemned than to the\r\nKing's service.\"[52]\r\n\r\nThe personal rule of Charles and his Ministers, Laud and Strafford, came to\r\nan end in the autumn of 1640, when there was no choice left to the King but\r\nto summon Parliament, if money was to be obtained. Earlier in the year the\r\n\"Short Parliament\" had met, only to be dissolved by the folly of the King\r\nafter a sitting of three weeks, because of its unwillingness to vote\r\nsupplies without the redress of grievances.\r\n\r\nThe disasters of the King's campaign against the Scots, an empty treasury,\r\nand a mutinous army, compelled the calling of Parliament. But the temper of\r\nthe men who came to the House of Commons in November was vastly different\r\nfrom the temper of the \"Short Parliament.\"[53] For this was the famous\r\n\"Long Parliament\" that assembled in the dark autumn days of 1640, and it\r\nwas to sit for thirteen years; to see the impeachment and execution of Laud\r\nand Strafford, the trial and execution of the King, the abolition of\r\nmonarchy and the House of Lords, the establishment of the Commonwealth; and\r\nwas itself to pass away finally only before Cromwell's military\r\ndictatorship.\r\n\r\nHampden was the great figure at the beginning of this Parliament. \"The eyes\r\nof all men were fixed upon him, as their _patriæ pater_, and the pilot that\r\nmust steer the vessel through the tempests and rocks which threatened it. I\r\nam persuaded (wrote Clarendon) his power and interest at that time were\r\ngreater to do good or hurt than any man's in the kingdom, or than any man\r\nof his rank hath had at any time; for his reputation of honesty was\r\nuniversal, and his affections seemed so publicly guided, that no corrupt or\r\nprivate ends could bias them.\"\r\n\r\nPolitically, neither Hampden nor Pym was Republican. Both believed in\r\ngovernment by King, Lords, and Commons; but both were determined that the\r\nKing's Ministers should be answerable to Parliament for the policy of the\r\nCrown, and that the Commons, who found the money for government, should\r\nhave a definite say in the spending of that money. As for the royal claim\r\nof \"Divine right,\" and the royal view that held passive obedience to be the\r\nduty of the King's subjects, and saw in Parliament merely a useful\r\ninstrument for the raising of funds to be spent by the royal pleasure\r\nwithout question or criticism--these things were intolerable to Hampden,\r\nPym, and the men of the House of Commons. The King would not govern through\r\nParliament; the House of Commons could govern without a King. It was left\r\nto the Civil War to decide the issue between the Crown and Parliament, and\r\nmake the House of Commons supreme.\r\n\r\nThings moved quickly in the first year of the Long Parliament. The Star\r\nChamber and High Commission Courts were abolished. Strafford was impeached\r\nfor high treason, and executed on Tower Hill. Archbishop Laud lay in\r\nprison, to be executed four years later. The Grand Remonstrance of the\r\nHouse of Commons was presented to Charles in December, 1641. The demands of\r\nthe Commons in the Remonstrance were not revolutionary, but they stated,\r\nquite frankly, the case for the Parliament. The main points were the need\r\nfor securities for the administration of justice, and an insistence on the\r\nresponsibility of the King's Ministers to the Houses of Parliament. The\r\nGrand Remonstrance was only carried by eleven votes in the House of\r\nCommons, 159 to 148, after wild scenes. \"Some waved their hats over their\r\nheads, and others took their swords in their scabbards out of their belts,\r\nand held them by the pummels in their hands, setting the lower part on the\r\nground.\" Actual violence was only prevented \"by the sagacity and great\r\ncalmness of Mr. Hampden, by a short speech.\"\r\n\r\nCharles promised an answer to the deputation of members who waited upon him\r\nwith the Grand Remonstrance, and early in the new year came the reply. The\r\nKing simply demanded the surrender of five members--Pym, Hampden, Holles,\r\nStrode, and Hazlerig--and their impeachment on the charge of high treason.\r\nAll constitutional law was set aside by a charge which proceeded personally\r\nfrom the King, which deprived the accused of their legal right to a trial\r\nby their peers, and summoned them before a tribunal which had no pretence\r\nto a justification over them. On the refusal of the Commons to surrender\r\ntheir members, Charles came in person to Westminster with 300 cavaliers to\r\ndemand their arrest. But the five members, warned of the King's venture,\r\nwere well out of the way, and rested safely within the City of London--for\r\nthe citizens were strongly for the Parliament. \"It was believed that if the\r\nKing had found them there (in the House of Commons), and called in his\r\nguards to have seized them, the members of the House would have endeavoured\r\nthe defence of them, which might have proved a very unhappy and sad\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\nAs it was, Charles could only retire \"in a more discontented and angry\r\npassion than he came in.\" The step was utterly ill-advised. Parliament was\r\nin no mood to favour royal encroachments, and the citizens of London were\r\nat hand, with their trained bands, to protect forcibly members of the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\nWar was now imminent. \"The attempt to seize the five members was\r\nundoubtedly the real cause of the war. From that moment, the loyal\r\nconfidence with which most of the popular party were beginning to regard\r\nthe King was turned into hatred and suspicion. From that moment, the\r\nParliament was compelled to surround itself with defensive arms. From that\r\nmoment, the city assumed the appearance of a garrison.\r\n\r\n\"The transaction was illegal from beginning to end. The impeachment was\r\nillegal. The process was illegal. The service was illegal. If Charles\r\nwished to prosecute the five members for treason, a bill against them\r\nshould have been sent to a grand jury. That a commoner cannot be tried for\r\nhigh treason by the Lords at the suit of the Crown, is part of the very\r\nalphabet of our law. That no man can be arrested by the King in person is\r\nequally clear. This was an established maxim of our jurisprudence even in\r\nthe time of Edward the Fourth. 'A subject,' said Chief Justice Markham to\r\nthat Prince, 'may arrest for treason; the King cannot; for, if the arrest\r\nbe illegal, the party has no remedy against the King.'\"[54]\r\n\r\nBoth King and Parliament broke rudely through all constitutional precedents\r\nin their preparations for hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe King levied troops by a royal commission, without any advice from\r\nParliament, and Pym got an ordinance passed, in both Houses, appointing the\r\nLords-Lieutenant of the counties to command the Militia without warrant\r\nfrom the Crown.\r\n\r\nA last attempt at negotiations was made at York, in April, when the\r\nproposals of Parliament--nineteen propositions for curtailing the power of\r\nthe Monarchy in favour of the Commons--were rejected by Charles with the\r\nwords: \"If I granted your demands, I should be no more than the mere\r\nphantom of a king.\"\r\n\r\nBy August, Charles had raised the royal standard at Nottingham, and war was\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nFive years later and Charles was a prisoner, to die in 1649 on the\r\nscaffold. That same year monarchy and the House of Lords were abolished by\r\nlaw; the Established Church had already fallen before the triumphant arms\r\nof the Puritans.\r\n\r\nThen, in 1653, the House of Commons itself fell--expelled by Cromwell; and\r\nthe task of the Lord Protector was to fashion a constitution that would\r\nwork.[55] What happened was the supremacy of the army. Parliament,\r\nattenuated and despised, contended in vain against the Protector. On\r\nCromwell's death, and the failure of his son, Richard, the army declared\r\nfor Charles II., and there was an end to the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PROTEST--LILBURNE\r\n\r\nIn all these changes the great mass of the people had neither part nor lot;\r\nand the famous leaders of the Parliamentary Party, resolute to curtail the\r\nabsolutism of the Crown, were no more concerned with the welfare of the\r\nlabouring people than the barons were in the time of John. The labouring\r\npeople--generally--were equally indifferent to the fortunes of Roundheads\r\nand Cavaliers, though the townsmen in many places held strong enough\r\nopinions on the matters of religion that were in dispute.[56]\r\n\r\nThat the common misery of the people was not in any way lightened by\r\nCromwell's rule we have abundant evidence, and it cannot be supposed that\r\nthe substitution of the Presbyterian discipline for episcopacy in the\r\nChurch, and the displacement of Presbyterians by Independents, was likely\r\nto alleviate this misery.\r\n\r\nTaxation was heavier than it had ever been before, and in Lancashire,\r\nWestmorland, and Cumberland the distress was appalling.\r\n\r\nWhitelocke, writing in 1649,[57] notes \"that many families in Lancashire\r\nwere starved.\" \"That many in Cumberland and Westmorland died in the\r\nhighways for want of bread, and divers left their habitations, travelling\r\nwith their wives and children to other parts to get relief, but could find\r\nnone. That the committees and Justices of the Peace of Cumberland signed a\r\ncertificate, that there were 30,000 families that had neither seed nor\r\nbread-corn, nor money to buy either, and they desired a collection for\r\nthem, which was made, but much too little to relieve so great a multitude.\"\r\n\r\nCromwell, occupied with high affairs of State, had neither time nor\r\ninclination to attend to social reform. Democracy had its witnesses;\r\nLilburne and the Levellers made their protest against military rule, and\r\nwere overpowered; Winstanley and his Diggers endeavoured to persuade the\r\ncountry that the common land should be occupied by dispossessed peasants,\r\nand were quickly suppressed.\r\n\r\nLilburne was concerned with the establishment of a political democracy,\r\nWinstanley with a social democracy, and in both cases the propaganda was\r\noffensive to the Protector.\r\n\r\nHad Cromwell listened to Lilburne, and made concessions towards democracy,\r\nthe reaction against Puritanism and the Commonwealth might have been\r\naverted.[58]\r\n\r\nJohn Lilburne had been a brave soldier in the army of the Parliament in the\r\nearly years of the Civil War, and he left the army in 1645 with the rank of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel (and with £880 arrears of pay due to him) rather than\r\ntake the covenant and subscribe to the requirements of the \"new model.\"\r\n\r\nThe monarchy having fallen, Lilburne saw the possibilities of tyranny in\r\nthe Parliamentary government, and at once spoke out. With considerable\r\nlegal knowledge, a passion for liberty, clear views on democracy, an\r\nenormous capacity for work, and great skill as a pamphleteer, Lilburne was\r\nnot to be ignored. The Government might have had him for a supporter; it\r\nunwisely decided to treat him as an enemy, and for ten years he was an\r\nunsparing critic, his popularity increasing with every fresh pamphlet he\r\nissued--and at every fresh imprisonment.\r\n\r\nLilburne urged a radical reform of Parliament and a general manhood\r\nsuffrage in 1647, and the \"Case for the Army,\" published by the Levellers\r\nin the same year, on the proposal of the Presbyterian majority in\r\nParliament that the army should be disbanded, demanded the abolition of\r\nmonopolies, freedom of trade and religion, restoration of enclosed common\r\nlands, and abolition of sinecures.\r\n\r\nBoth Cromwell and Ireton were strongly opposed to manhood suffrage, and\r\nCromwell--to whom the immediate danger was a royalist reaction--had no\r\npatience for men who would embark on democratic experiments at such a\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nLilburne and the Levellers were equally distrustful of Cromwell's new\r\nCouncil of State. \"We were ruled before by King, Lords, and Commons, now by\r\na General, Court-martial, and Commons; and, we pray you, what is the\r\ndifference?\" So they put the question in 1648.\r\n\r\nTo Cromwell the one safety for the Commonwealth was in the loyalty of the\r\narmy to the Government. To Lilburne the one guarantee for good government\r\nwas in the supremacy of a Parliament elected by manhood suffrage. He saw\r\nplainly that unless steps were taken to establish democratic institutions\r\nthere was no future for the Commonwealth; and he took no part in the trial\r\nof Charles I., saying openly that he doubted the wisdom of abolishing\r\nmonarchy before a new constitution had been drawn up.\r\n\r\nBut Lilburne overestimated the strength of the Leveller movement in the\r\narmy, and the corporals who revolted were shot by sentence of\r\ncourts-martial.[59]\r\n\r\nIn vain the democratic troopers argued, \"the old king's person and the old\r\nlords are but removed, and a new king and new lords with the commons are in\r\none House, and so we are under a more absolute arbitrary monarchy than\r\nbefore.\" The Government answered by clapping Lilburne in the Tower, where,\r\nin spite of a petition signed by 80,000 for his release, he remained for\r\nthree months without being brought to trial. Released on bail, Lilburne,\r\nwho from prison had issued an \"Agreement of the Free People,\" calling for\r\nannual parliaments elected by manhood suffrage and the free election of\r\nunendowed church ministers in every parish, now published an \"Impeachment\r\nfor High Treason against Oliver Cromwell and his son-in-law, James Ireton,\"\r\nand declared that monarchy was preferable to a military despotism. At last,\r\nbrought to trial on the charge of \"treason,\" Lilburne was acquitted with \"a\r\nloud and unanimous shout\" of popular approval.[60] \"In a revolution where\r\nothers argued about the respective rights of King and Parliament, he spoke\r\nalways of the rights of the people. His dauntless courage and his power of\r\nspeech made him the idol of the mob.\"[61]\r\n\r\nLilburne was again brought to trial, in 1653, and again acquitted, with\r\nundiminished enthusiasm. But \"for the peace of the nation,\" Cromwell\r\nrefused to allow the irrepressible agitator to be at large, and for two\r\nyears Lilburne, \"Free-born John,\" was kept in prison. During those years\r\nall power in the House of Commons was broken by the rule of the Army of the\r\nCommonwealth, and Parliament stood in abject submission before the Lord\r\nProtector. Only when his health was shattered, and he had embraced Quaker\r\nprinciples, was Lilburne released, and granted a pension of 40s. a week.\r\nThe following year, at the age of 40, Lilburne died of consumption--brought\r\non by the close confinement he had suffered. A year later, 1658, and\r\nCromwell, by whose side Lilburne had fought at Marston Moor, and against\r\nwhose rule he had contended for so many a year, was dead, and the\r\nCommonwealth Government was doomed.\r\n\r\nWINSTANLEY AND \"THE DIGGERS\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Digger\" movement was a shorter and much more obscure protest on behalf\r\nof the people than Lilburne's agitation for democracy; but it is notable\r\nfor its social significance.\r\n\r\nWhile Lilburne strove vigorously for political reforms that are still\r\nunaccomplished, Gerrard Winstanley preached a revolutionary gospel of\r\nsocial reform--as John Ball and Robert Ket had before him. But Winstanley's\r\nsocial doctrine allowed no room for violence, and included the\r\nnon-resistance principles that found exposition in the Society of Friends.\r\nHence the \"Diggers,\" preaching agrarian revolution; but denying all right\r\nto force of arms, never endangered the Commonwealth Government as Lilburne\r\nand the Levellers did.\r\n\r\nFree Communism was the creed of more than one Protestant sect in the\r\nsixteenth century, and the Anabaptists on the Continent had been\r\nconspicuous for their experiments in community of goods and anarchist\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nWinstanley confined his teaching and practice to common ownership of land,\r\npleading for the cultivation of the enclosed common lands, \"that all may\r\nfeed upon the crops of the earth, and the burden of poverty be removed.\"\r\nThere was to be no forcible expropriation of landlords.\r\n\r\n\"If the rich still hold fast to this propriety of Mine and Thine, let them\r\nlabour their own lands with their own hands. And let the common people,\r\nthat say the earth is _ours_, not _mine_, let them labour together, and eat\r\nbread together upon the commons, mountains, and hills.\r\n\r\n\"For as the enclosures are called such a man's land, and such a man's land,\r\nso the Commons and Heath are called the common people's. And let the world\r\nsee who labour the earth in righteousness, and those to whom the Lord gives\r\nthe blessing, let them be the people that shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\n\"None can say that their right is taken from them. For let the rich work\r\nalone by themselves; and let the poor work together by themselves.\"[62]\r\n\r\nWith the common ownership and cultivation of land, an end was to be made of\r\nall tyranny of man over his fellows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN HAMPDEN\r\n\r\n_After the Engraving by G. Houbraken._]\r\n\r\n\"Leave off dominion and lordship one over another; for the whole bulk of\r\nmankind are but one living earth. Leave off imprisoning, whipping, and\r\nkilling, which are but the actings of the curse. Let those that have\r\nhitherto had no land, and have been forced to rob and steal through\r\npoverty; henceforth let them quietly enjoy land to work upon, that everyone\r\nmay enjoy the benefit of his creation, and eat his own bread with the sweat\r\nof his own brow.\"\r\n\r\nWinstanley's argument was quite simple:\r\n\r\n\"If any man can say that he makes corn or cattle, he may say, _That is\r\nmine_. But if the Lord made these for the use of His creation, surely then\r\nthe earth was made by the Lord to be a Common Treasury for all, not a\r\nparticular treasury for some.\"\r\n\r\nTwo objections were urged against private property in land:\r\n\r\n\"First, it hath occasioned people to steal from one another. Secondly, it\r\nhath made laws to hang those that did steal. It tempts people to do an evil\r\naction, and then kills them for doing it.\" It was a prolific age for\r\npamphlets, the seventeenth century; the land teemed with preachers and\r\nvisionaries, and Winstanley's writings never attracted the sympathy that\r\nwas given to the fierce controversialists on theological and political\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nOnly when Winstanley and his Diggers set to work with spade and shovel on\r\nthe barren soil of St. George's Hill, in Surrey, in the spring of 1649, was\r\nthe attention of the Council of State called to the strange proceedings.\r\nThe matter was left to the local magistrates and landowners, and the\r\nDiggers were suppressed. A similar attempt to reclaim land near\r\nWellingboro' was stopped at once as \"seditious and tumultuous.\" It was\r\nquite useless for Winstanley to maintain that the English people were\r\ndispossessed of their lands by the Crown at the Norman Conquest, and that\r\nwith the execution of the King the ownership of the Crown lands ought to\r\nrevert to the people; Cromwell and the Council of State had no more\r\npatience with prophets of land nationalisation than with agitators of\r\nmanhood suffrage. Indeed, the Commonwealth Government never took the\r\ntrouble to distinguish between the different groups of disaffected people,\r\nbut set them all down as \"Levellers,\" to be punished as disturbers of the\r\npeace if they refused to obey authority.\r\n\r\nWinstanley's last pamphlet was \"True Magistracy Restored,\" an open letter\r\nto Oliver Cromwell, 1652, and after its publication Gerrard Winstanley and\r\nhis Diggers are heard of no more.\r\n\r\nTo-day both Lilburne and Winstanley are to be recalled because the\r\nagitation for political democracy is always with us, and the question of\r\nland tenure is seen to be of profound importance in the discussion of\r\nsocial reform. No democratic statesman in our time can propose an\r\nimprovement in the social condition of the people without reference to the\r\nland question, and no social reformer of the nineteenth century has had\r\nmore influence or been more widely read and discussed than Henry\r\nGeorge--the exponent of the Single Tax on Land Values.\r\n\r\nWinstanley was very little heeded in his own day, but two hundred and fifty\r\nyears later the civilised countries of the earth are found in deep debate\r\nover the respective rights of landowners and landless, and the relation of\r\npoverty to land ownership. State ownership, taxation of land values,\r\npeasant proprietorship, co-operative agriculture--all have their advocates\r\nto-day, but to Winstanley's question whether the earth was made \"for to\r\ngive ease to a few or health to all,\" only one answer is returned.\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION\r\n\r\nUnder the Commonwealth the landowners were as powerful as they had been\r\nunder the monarchy. Enclosures continued. Social reform was not\r\ncontemplated by Cromwell nor by Councils of State; democracy was equally\r\noutside the political vision of government. Church of England ministers\r\nwere dispossessed in favour of Nonconformists, Puritanism became the\r\nestablished faith, Catholicism remained proscribed.\r\n\r\nThe interest in ecclesiastical and theological disputes was considerable,\r\nand Puritanism was popular with large numbers of the middle-class. But to\r\nthe mass of the people Puritanism was merely the suppression of further\r\nliberties, the prohibition of old customs, the stern abolition of Christmas\r\nrevels and May-day games.\r\n\r\nLilburne did his best to get Cromwell to allow the people some\r\nresponsibility in the choice of its rulers. Winstanley proposed a remedy\r\nfor the social distress. To neither of these men was any concession made,\r\nand no consideration was given to their appeals.\r\n\r\nHence the bulk of the nation, ignored by the Commonwealth Government, and\r\nalienated by Puritanism, accepted quite amiably--indeed, with\r\nenthusiasm--the restoration of the monarchy on the return of Charles II.,\r\nand was unmoved by the royalist reaction against Parliamentary Government\r\nthat followed on the Restoration.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons itself, when Monk and his army had gone over to the\r\nside of Charles, voted, in the Convention Parliament of 1660, \"that\r\naccording to the ancient and fundamental laws of this Kingdom, the\r\ngovernment is, and ought to be, by King, Lords, and Commons,\" and Charles\r\nII. was received in London with uproarious enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe army was disbanded; a royalist House of Commons restored the Church of\r\nEngland and ordered general acceptance of its Prayer Book. Puritanism,\r\ndriven from rule, could only remain in power in the heart and conscience of\r\nits adherents.\r\n\r\nTo the old Commonwealth man it might seem, in the reaction against\r\nPuritanism, and in the popularity of the King, that all that had been\r\nstriven for in the civil war had been lost, in the same way as after the\r\ndeath of Simon of Montfort it might have appeared that \"the good cause\" had\r\nperished with its great leader. In reality the House of Commons stood on\r\nstronger ground than ever, and was to show its strength when James II.\r\nattempted to override its decisions. In the main the very forms of\r\nParliamentary procedure were settled in the seventeenth century, to remain\r\nundisturbed till the nineteenth century. \"The Parliamentary procedure of\r\n1844 was essentially the procedure on which the House of Commons conducted\r\nits business during the Long Parliament.\"[63]\r\n\r\nWith Charles II. on the throne the absolutism of the Crown over Parliament\r\npassed for ever from England. Cromwell had set up the supremacy of the army\r\nover the Commons: this, too, was gone, never to be restored.\r\n\r\nHenceforth government was to be by King, Lords, and Commons; but\r\nsovereignty was to reside in Parliament. Not till a century later would\r\ndemocracy again be heard of, and its merits urged, as Lilburne had urged\r\nthem under the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT--ARISTOCRACY TRIUMPHANT\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT BY ARISTOCRACY\r\n\r\nFor nearly two centuries--from 1660 to 1830--England was governed by an\r\naristocracy of landowners. Charles II. kept the throne for twenty-five\r\nyears, because he had wit enough to avoid an open collision with\r\nParliament. James II. fled the country after three years--understanding no\r\nmore than his father had understood that tyranny was not possible save by\r\nconsent of Parliament or by military prowess. At the Restoration the royal\r\nprerogative was dead, and nothing in Charles II.'s reign tended to diminish\r\nthe power of Parliament in favour of the throne. Charles was an astute\r\nmonarch who did not wish to be sent on his travels again, and consequently\r\ntook care not to outrage the nation by any attempt upon the liberties of\r\nParliament. Only by the Tudor method of using Parliament as the instrument\r\nof the royal will could James II. have accomplished the constitutional\r\nchanges he had set his heart upon. In attempting to set up toleration for\r\nthe Roman Catholic religion, and in openly appointing Roman Catholics to\r\npositions of importance, James II. set Parliament at defiance and ranged\r\nthe forces of the Established Church against himself. The method was doomed\r\nto failure. \"None have gone about to break Parliaments but in the end\r\nParliaments have broken them.\"[64] In any case the notion of restoring\r\npolitical liberty to Catholics was a bold endeavour in 1685. Against the\r\nwill of Parliament the project was folly. To overthrow the rights of\r\ncorporations and of the Universities, and to attempt to bully the Church of\r\nEngland, after Elizabeth's fashion, at the very beginning of a pro-Catholic\r\nmovement, was to provoke defeat.\r\n\r\nParliament decided that James II. had \"abdicated,\" when, deserted by\r\nChurchill, he fled to France, and William and Mary came to the throne at\r\nthe express invitation of Parliament. The Revolution completed the work of\r\nthe Long Parliament by defining the limits of monarchy, and establishing\r\nconstitutional government. It was not--this Revolution, of 1688--the first\r\ntime Parliament had sanctioned the deposing of the King of England and the\r\nappointment of his successor,[65] but it was the last. Never again since\r\nthe accession of William and Mary have the relations of the Crown and\r\nParliament been strained to breaking point; never has the supremacy of\r\nParliament been seriously threatened by the power of the throne.\r\n\r\nThe full effects of the Revolution of 1688 were seen in the course of the\r\nnext fifty years. Aristocracy, then mainly Whig, was triumphant, and under\r\nits rule, while large measures of civil and religious liberty were passed,\r\nthe condition of the mass of labouring people was generally wretched in the\r\nextreme. The rule of the aristocracy saw England become a great power among\r\nthe nations of the world, and the British Navy supreme over the navies of\r\nEurope; but it saw also an industrial population, untaught and uncared for,\r\nsink deeper and deeper into savagery and misery. For a time in the\r\neighteenth century the farmer and the peasant were prosperous, but by the\r\nclose of that century the small farmer was a ruined man, and with the\r\nlabourer was carried by the industrial revolution into the town. The worst\r\ntimes for the English labourer in town and country since the Norman\r\nConquest were the reign of Edward VI. and the first quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe development of our political institutions into their present form; the\r\nestablishment of our Party system of government by Cabinet, and of the\r\nauthority of the Prime Minister; the growth of the supreme power of the\r\nCommons, not only over the throne but over the Lords also: these were the\r\nwork of the aristocracy of the eighteenth century, and were attained by\r\nsteps so gradual as to be almost imperceptible. No idea of democracy guided\r\nthe process; yet our modern democratic system is firm-rooted upon the\r\nprinciples and privileges of the Constitution as thus established. Social\r\nmisery deepened, without check from the politicians; and the most\r\nenlightened statesmen of the Whig regime were very far from our present\r\nconceptions of the duties and possibilities of Parliament.\r\n\r\nCIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY\r\n\r\nJames II. was tumbled from the throne for his vain attempt to establish\r\ntoleration for Catholics and Nonconformists without consent of Parliament.\r\nYet the Whig aristocracy which followed, while it did nothing for\r\nCatholics, laid broad principles of civil and religious liberty for\r\ndemocracy to build upon.[66]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Right, presented by Parliament to William and Mary on\r\ntheir arrival in London, was turned into the Bill of Rights, and passed\r\ninto law in 1689. It stands as the last of the great charters of political\r\nliberty, and states clearly both what is not permitted to the Crown, and\r\nwhat privileges are allowed to the people.\r\n\r\nUnder the Bill of Rights the King was denied the power of suspending or\r\ndispensing, of levying money, or maintaining a standing army without\r\nconsent of Parliament. The people were assured of the right of the subject\r\nto petition the Crown, and of the free election of representatives in\r\nParliament, and of full and free debate in Parliament. Any profession of\r\nthe Catholic religion, or marriage with a Catholic, disqualified from\r\ninheritance to or possession of the throne.\r\n\r\nSo there was an end to the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings, and four\r\nhundred non-juring clergymen--including half-a-dozen bishops--of the Church\r\nof England were deprived of their ecclesiastical appointments for refusing\r\nto accept the accomplished fact, and acknowledge William III. as the lawful\r\nKing of England. By making William King, to the exclusion of the children\r\nof James II., Parliament destroyed for all future time in England the\r\nbelief in the sacred character of kingship. The King was henceforth a part\r\nof the constitution, and came to the throne by authority of Parliament, on\r\nconditions laid down by Parliament.\r\n\r\nWilliam resented the decision of Parliament not to allow the Crown a\r\nrevenue for life, but to vote an annual supply; but the decision was\r\nadhered to, and has remained in force ever since. The Mutiny Act, passed\r\nthe same year, placed the army under the control of Parliament, and the\r\nannual vote for military expenses has, in like manner, remained.\r\n\r\nThe Toleration Act (1689) gave Nonconformists a legal right to worship in\r\ntheir own chapels, but expressly excluded Unitarians and Roman Catholics\r\nfrom this liberty. Life was made still harder for Roman Catholics in\r\nEngland by the Act of 1700, which forbade a Catholic priest, under penalty\r\nof imprisonment for life, to say mass, hear confessions, or exercise any\r\nclerical function, and denied the right of the Catholic laity to hold, buy\r\nor inherit property, or to have their children educated abroad. The\r\nobjection to Roman Catholics was that their loyalty to the Pope was an\r\nallegiance to a \"foreign\" ruler which prevented their being good citizens\r\nat home. Against this prejudice it was useless to point to what had been\r\ndone by Englishmen for their country, when all the land was Catholic, and\r\nall accepted the supremacy of the Pope. It was not till 1778 that the first\r\nCatholic Relief Bill was carried, a Bill that \"shook the general prejudice\r\nagainst Catholics to the centre, and restored to them a thousand\r\nindescribable charities in the ordinary intercourse of social life which\r\nthey had seldom experienced.\"\r\n\r\nThe last Roman Catholic to die for conscience' sake was Oliver Plunket,\r\nArchbishop of Armagh, who was executed at Tyburn, when Charles II. was\r\nKing, in 1681. After the Revolution, Nonconformists and Catholics were no\r\nlonger hanged or tortured for declining the ministrations of the\r\nEstablished Church, but still were penalised in many lesser ways. But the\r\nspirit of the eighteenth century made for toleration, and the Whigs were as\r\nunostentatious in their own piety as they were indifferent to the piety of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe killing of \"witches,\" however, went on in Scotland and in England long\r\nafter toleration had been secured for Nonconformists. As late as 1712 a\r\nwoman was executed for witchcraft in England.[67]\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF CABINET RULE\r\n\r\nWilliam III. began with a mixed ministry of Whigs and Tories, which\r\nincluded men like Danby and Godolphin, who had served under James II. But\r\nthe fierce wrangling that went on over the war then being waged on the\r\nContinent was decidedly inconvenient, and by 1696 the Whigs had succeeded\r\nin driving all the Tories--who were against the war--out of office. Then\r\nfor the first time a united ministry was in power, and from a Cabinet of\r\nmen with common political opinions the next step was to secure that the\r\nCabinet should represent the party with a majority in the House of Commons.\r\nOur present system of Cabinet rule, dependent on the will of the majority\r\nof the Commons, is found in full operation by the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The fact that William III., George I., and George II. were all\r\nforeigners necessitated the King's ministers using considerable powers. But\r\nGeorge III. was English, and effected a revival in the personal power of\r\nthe King by his determination that the choice of ministers should rest with\r\nthe Crown, and not with the House of Commons. He succeeded in breaking up\r\nthe long Whig ascendancy, and so accustomed became the people to the King\r\nmaking and unmaking ministries, that on George IV.'s accession in 1820 it\r\nwas fully expected the new King would turn out the Tories and put in Whigs.\r\nWilliam IV. in 1835 did what no sovereign has done since--dissolved\r\nParliament against the wish of the government.\r\n\r\nFrom 1696 to 1701 the Whigs were in office. Then on the death of William\r\nand the accession of Anne, Tory ministers were included in the government,\r\nand for seven years the Cabinet was composite again. But Marlborough and\r\nGodolphin found that if they were to remain in power it must be by the\r\nsupport of the Whigs, who had made the support of the war against France a\r\nparty question; and from 1708 to 1710 the ministry was definitely Whig. By\r\n1710 the war had ceased to be popular, and the general election of that\r\nyear sent back a strong Tory majority to the House of Commons, with the\r\nresult that the Tory leaders, Harley (Earl of Oxford) and Henry St. John\r\n(Bolingbroke) took office. The Tories fell on the death of Anne, because\r\ntheir plot to place James (generally called the Chevalier or the old\r\nPretender), the Queen's half-brother, on the throne was defeated by the\r\nreadiness of the Whig Dukes of Somerset and Argyll to proclaim George,\r\nElector of Hanover, King of England. By the Act of Settlement, 1701,\r\nParliament had decided that the Crown should pass from Anne to the heirs of\r\nSophia, Electress of Hanover and daughter of James I.; and the fact that\r\nthe Chevalier was a Catholic made his accession impossible according to\r\nlaw, and the policy of Bolingbroke highly treasonable.\r\n\r\nGeorge I. could not speak English, and relied entirely on his Whig\r\nministers. Bolingbroke fled to the Continent, but was permitted to return\r\nfrom exile nine years later. Oxford was impeached and sent to the Tower.\r\nThe Whigs were left in triumph to rule the country for nearly fifty\r\nyears--until the restiveness of George III. broke up their dominion--and\r\nfor more than twenty years of that period Walpole was Prime Minister.\r\nCabinet government--that is, government by a small body of men, agreed upon\r\nmain questions of policy, and commanding the confidence of the majority of\r\nthe House of Commons--was now in full swing, and in spite of the monarchist\r\nrevival under George III., no King henceforth ever refused consent to a\r\nBill passed by Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs did nothing in those first sixty years of the eighteenth century\r\nto make the House of Commons more representative of the people. They were\r\ncontent to repeat the old cries of the Revolution, and to oppose all\r\nproposals of change. But they governed England without oppression, and\r\nWalpole's commercial and financial measures satisfied the trading classes\r\nand kept national credit sound.\r\n\r\nWALPOLE'S RULE\r\n\r\nWalpole remained in power from 1720 to 1742 by sheer corruption--there was\r\nno other way open to him. He laughed openly at all talk of honesty and\r\npurity, and his influence lowered the whole tone of public life.[68] But he\r\nkept in touch with the middle classes, was honest personally, and had a\r\nlarge amount of tact and good sense. His power in the House of Commons\r\nendured because he understood the management of parliamentary affairs, and\r\nhad a genius for discerning the men whose support he could buy, and whose\r\nsupport was valuable.\r\n\r\nGeorge III. went to work in much the same way as Walpole had done, and only\r\nsucceeded in breaking down the power of the Whig houses by using the same\r\ncorrupt methods that Walpole had employed. The \"King's friends,\" as they\r\nwere called, acted independently of the party leaders, and in the pay of\r\nthe King were the chief instrument of George III.'s will.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS\r\n\r\nBut George III. not only turned the Whigs out of office, he altered\r\npermanently the political complexion of the House of Lords. From the time\r\nof the Revolution of 1688 to the death of George II. in 1760, the Lords\r\nwere Whiggish, and the majority of English nobles held Whig principles.\r\nThey were, on the whole, men of better education than the average member of\r\nthe House of Commons, who was in most cases a fox-hunting squire, of the\r\nSquire Western type. The House of Lords stood in the way of the Commons\r\nwhen, in the Tory reaction of 1701, the Commons proposed to impeach Somers,\r\nthe Whig Chancellor, a high-minded and skilful lawyer, \"courteous and\r\ncomplaisant, humane and benevolent,\" for his share in the Second Partition\r\nTreaty of 1699, and this was the beginning of a bitter contest between the\r\nTory Commons and the Whig Lords. An attempt was made by the Commons to\r\nimpeach Walpole on his fall in 1742, but the Lords threw out a Bill\r\nproposing to remit the penalties to which his prosecutor might be liable,\r\nand the King made Walpole a peer. George III., by an unsparing use of his\r\nprerogative, changed the character and politics of the Upper House. His\r\ncreations were country gentlemen of sufficient wealth to own \"pocket\"\r\nboroughs in the House of Commons, and lawyers who supported the Royal\r\nprerogative.[69]\r\n\r\nFrom George III.'s time onward there has always been a standing and\r\never-increasing majority of Tory peers in the House of Lords. And while the\r\nactual number of members of the Upper House has been enlarged enormously,\r\nthis majority has became enlarged out of all proportion. Liberal and Tory\r\nPrime Ministers were busy throughout the nineteenth century adding to the\r\npeerage--no less than 376 new peers were created between 1800 and 1907; but\r\ncomparatively few Liberals retained their principles when they became\r\npeers, and two of the present chiefs of the Unionist Party in the House of\r\nLords--Lords Lansdowne and Selborne--are the sons of eminent Liberals.\r\n\r\nSo it has come about that while the House of Commons has been steadily\r\nopening its doors to men of all ranks and classes, and in our time has\r\nbecome increasingly democratic in character, the House of Lords, confined\r\nin the main to men of wealth and social importance, has become an enormous\r\nassembly of undistinguished persons, where only a small minority are active\r\npoliticians, and of this minority at least three-fourths are Conservatives.\r\n\r\nThis change in the House of Lords began, as we have seen, in the reign of\r\nGeorge III., when the Whig ascendancy in Parliament had passed. But the\r\nWhigs did nothing during their long lease of power to bring democracy\r\nnearer, and were entirely contemptuous of popular aspirations. At the very\r\ntime when the democratic idea was the theme of philosophers, and was to be\r\nseen expressed in the constitution of the revolted American colonies, and\r\nin the French Revolution, England remained under an aristocracy, governed\r\nfirst by Whigs, and then by Tories. It is true democracy was not without\r\nits spokesmen in England in the eighteenth century, but there was no\r\npopular movement in politics to stir the masses of the people, as the\r\npreaching of the Methodists stirred their hearts for religion. Democratic\r\nideas were as remote from popular discussion in the eighteenth century as\r\nthey had been made familiar by Lilburne for a brief season in the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\"WILKES AND LIBERTY\"\r\n\r\nA word must be said about John Wilkes, a man of disreputable character and\r\nconsiderable ability, who for some ten years--1763-73--contended for the\r\nrights of electors against the Whig Government. The battle began when\r\nGeorge Grenville, the Whig Prime Minister, had Wilkes arrested on a general\r\nwarrant for an article attacking the King's Speech in No. 45 of the _North\r\nBriton_, a scurrilous newspaper which belonged to Wilkes. Chief Justice\r\nPratt declared the arrest illegal on the ground that the warrant was bad,\r\nand that Wilkes, being at the time M.P. for Aylesbury, enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of Parliament. A jury awarded Wilkes heavy damages against the\r\nGovernment for false imprisonment, and the result of the trial made Wilkes\r\na popular hero. Then, in 1764, the Government brought a new charge of\r\nblasphemy and libel, and Wilkes, expelled from the House of Commons, and\r\ncondemned by the King's Bench, fled to France, and was promptly declared an\r\noutlaw. He returned, however, a year or two later, and while in prison was\r\nelected M.P. for Middlesex. The House of Commons, led by the Government,\r\nset the election aside, and riots for \"Wilkes and Liberty\" broke out in\r\nLondon. The question was: Had the House of Commons a right to exclude a\r\nmember duly elected for a constituency?--the same question that was raised\r\nover Charles Bradlaugh, a man of very different character, in the\r\nParliament of 1880. Again and again in 1768 and 1769 Wilkes was re-elected\r\nfor Middlesex, only to be expelled, and finally the House decided that\r\nWilkes' opponent, Colonel Luttrell, was to sit, although Luttrell was\r\nmanifestly not chosen by the majority of electors. The citizens of London\r\nreplied to this by choosing Wilkes for Sheriff and Alderman in 1770, and by\r\nmaking him Lord Mayor four years later. The Government gave up the contest\r\nat last, and Wilkes was allowed to take his seat. Besides vindicating the\r\nright of constituencies against the claim of Parliament to exclude\r\nundesirable persons, Wilkes did a good deal towards securing that right of\r\nParliamentary debating which was practically admitted after 1771.\r\n\r\nBut the \"Wilkes and Liberty\" movement was no more than a popular enthusiasm\r\nof the London mob for an enemy of the Government, and a determination of\r\nLondon citizens and Middlesex electors not to be brow-beaten by the\r\nGovernment. Wilkes himself always denied that he was a \"Wilkesite,\" and he\r\nhad no following in the country or in Parliament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC IDEA\r\n\r\nTHE WITNESS OF THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\nThe idea of constitutional government has its witnesses in the Middle Ages,\r\ndemocratic theories are common in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\r\nbut it is not till the eighteenth century that France, aflame to realise a\r\npolitical ideal, proves that democracy has passed from the books of\r\nschoolmen and philosophers, and is to be put in practice by a nation in\r\narms.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century the friars rallied to Simon of Montfort and\r\npreached, not democracy, but constitutional liberty.[70] Thomas Aquinas,\r\nthe great Dominican doctor, became the chief exponent of political theory,\r\nand maintained that sovereignty expressed in legislative power should be\r\nexercised for the common good, and that a mixed government of monarch,\r\nnobles, and people, with the Pope as a final Court of Appeal, would best\r\nattain that end.[71]\r\n\r\nA hundred years later, John Ball and his fellow agitators preached a gospel\r\nof social equality that inspired the Peasant Revolt. But communism was the\r\ngoal of the peasant leaders in 1381, and freedom from actual oppression the\r\ndesire of their followers. No conception of political democracy can be\r\nfound in the speeches and demands of Wat Tyler.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century Robert Ket in Norfolk renewed the old cries of\r\nsocial revolution, and roused the countryside to stop the enclosures by\r\narmed revolt. And again the popular rising is an agrarian war to end\r\nintolerable conditions, not a movement for popular government.\r\n\r\nTHE \"SOCIAL CONTRACT\" THEORY\r\n\r\nThe theory of a pact or contract between the Government and the people\r\nbecame the favourite assumption of political writers from the sixteenth\r\ncentury onward, and it was this theory that Rousseau popularised in his\r\n\"Social Contract,\" the theory, too, which triumphed for a season in the\r\nFrench Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe theory is, of course, pure assumption, without any basis in history,\r\nand resting on no foundation of fact. It assumes that primitive man was\r\nborn with enlightened views on civil government, and that for the greater\r\nwell-being of his tribe or nation he deposited the sovereign authority\r\nwhich belonged to himself, in a prince or king--or in some other form of\r\nexecutive government--retaining the right to withdraw his allegiance from\r\nthe government if the authority is abused, and the contract which conferred\r\nsovereignty violated. It was not maintained that the contract was an\r\nactually written document; it was supposed to be a tacit agreement. The\r\nwhole theory seems to have sprung from the study of Roman law and the\r\nconstitutions of Athens and Sparta. Nothing was known of primitive man or\r\nof the beginnings of civilisation till the nineteenth century. The Bible\r\nand the classical literature of Greece and Rome are all concerned with\r\ncivilised, not primitive, man, and with slaves and \"heathens\" who are\r\naccounted less than men. The \"sovereign people\" of Athens and Sparta became\r\nthe model of later republican writers, while the choosing of a king by the\r\nIsraelites recorded in the Old Testament sanctioned the idea, for early\r\nProtestant writers, that sovereignty was originally in the people.\r\n\r\nThe Huguenot Languet, in his _Vindiciae contra Tyrannos_ (1579), maintained\r\non scriptural grounds that kingly power was derived from the will of the\r\npeople, and that the violation by the king of the mutual compact of king\r\nand people to observe the laws absolved the people from all allegiance.[72]\r\nThe Jesuit writers, Bellarmine and Mariana, argued for the sovereignty of\r\nthe people as the basis of kingly rule; and when the English divines of the\r\nEstablished Church were upholding the doctrine of the divine right of\r\nkings, the Spanish Jesuit, Suarez, was amongst those who attacked that\r\ndoctrine, quoting a great body of legal opinion in support of the\r\ncontention that \"the prince has that power of law giving which the people\r\nhave given him.\" Suarez, too, insists that all men are born equal, and that\r\n\"no one has a political jurisdiction over another.\" Milton, in his \"Tenure\r\nof Kings and Magistrates\" (1649), had taken a similar line: the people had\r\nvested in kings and magistrates the authority and power of self-defence and\r\npreservation. \"The power of kings and magistrates is nothing else but what\r\nis only derivative, transferred, and committed to them in trust from the\r\npeople to the common good of all, in whom the power yet remains\r\nfundamentally, and cannot be taken from them without a violation of their\r\nnatural birthright.\" Hooker, fifty years earlier (1592-3), in his\r\n\"Ecclesiastical Polity,\" Book I., had affirmed the sovereignty or\r\nlegislative power of the people as the ultimate authority, and had also\r\ndeclared for an original social contract, \"all public regiment of what kind\r\nsoever seemeth evidently to have risen from deliberate advice,\r\nconsultation, and composition between men, judging it convenient and\r\nbehoveful.\" Hobbes made the social contract a justification for Royal\r\nabsolutism, and Locke, with a Whig ideal of constitutional government,\r\nenlarged on the right of a people to change its form of government, and\r\njustified the Revolution of 1688. The writings of Hobbes and Locke have had\r\na lasting influence, and Locke is really the source of the democratic\r\nstream of the eighteenth century. It rises in Locke to become the torrent\r\nof the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nBut Huguenots and Jesuits, Hooker and Milton--what influence had their\r\nwritings on the mass of English people? None whatever, as far as we can\r\nsee. Milton could write of \"the power\" of \"the people\" as a \"natural\r\nbirthright,\" but the power was plainly in Cromwell's army, and \"the people\"\r\nhad no means of expression concerning its will, and no opportunity for the\r\nassertion of sovereignty. Lilburne and the Levellers held that democracy\r\ncould be set up on the ruins of Charles I.'s Government, and the\r\nsovereignty of the people become a fact; and with a ready political\r\ninstinct Lilburne proposed the election of popular representatives on a\r\ndemocratic franchise. Cromwell rejected all Lilburne's proposals; for him\r\naffairs of State were too serious for experiments in democracy; and\r\nLilburne himself was cast into prison by the Commonwealth Government.\r\nLilburne's pamphlets were exceedingly numerous, and his popularity, in\r\nLondon particularly, enormous. He was the voice of the unrepresented,\r\npowerless citizens in whom the republican theorists saw the centre of\r\nauthority. The one effort to persuade the Commonwealth Republic to give\r\npower to the people was made by John Lilburne, and it was defeated. The\r\nWhig theory that an aristocratic House of Commons, elected by a handful of\r\npeople, and mainly at the dictation of the landowners, was \"the People,\"\r\ntriumphed. The bulk of the English people were left out of all account in\r\nthe political struggles of Whigs and Tories, and democracy was not dreamed\r\nof till America was free and France a republic. The industrial revolution\r\ncompelled the reform of the British House of Commons, and democracy has\r\nslowly superseded aristocracy, not from any enthusiasm for the \"sovereign\r\npeople,\" but from the traditional belief that representative government\r\nmeans the rule of the people.\r\n\r\nPrecedent, not theory, has been the argument for democracy in England.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HOBBES (1588-1679)\r\n\r\nThe writings of Hobbes are important, because they state the case for\r\nabsolute rule, or \"a strong government,\" as we call it to-day. Hobbes was\r\nfrankly rationalist and secular. Holding the great end of government to be\r\nhappiness, he made out that natural man lived in savage ill-will with his\r\nfellows. To secure some sort of decency and safety men combined together\r\nand surrendered all natural rights to a sovereign--either one man, or an\r\nassembly of men--and in return civil rights were guaranteed. But the\r\nsovereignty once established was supreme, and to injure it was to injure\r\noneself, since it was composed of \"every particular man.\" The sovereign\r\npower was unlimited, and was not to be questioned. Whether monarchy,\r\naristocracy, or democracy was the form of government was unimportant,\r\nthough Hobbes preferred monarchy, because popular assemblies were unstable\r\nand apt to need dictators. Civil laws were the standard of right and wrong,\r\nand obedience to autocracy was better than the resistance which led to\r\ncivil war or anarchy--the very things that induced men to establish\r\nsovereignty. Only when the safety of the state was threatened was rebellion\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\nAt bottom, the objection to the theories of Hobbes is the same objection\r\nthat must be taken to the theories of Locke and Rousseau. All these writers\r\nassume not only the fiction of a social contract, but a _static_ view of\r\nsociety. Society is the result of growth: it is not a fixed and settled\r\ncommunity. Mankind proceeds experimentally in forms of government. To\r\nHobbes and his followers, security of life and property was the one\r\nessential thing for mankind--disorder and social insecurity the things to\r\nbe prevented at all cost. Now, this might be all very well but for\r\nevolution. Mankind cannot rest quietly under the strongest and most stable\r\ngovernment in the world. It will insist on learning new tricks, on thinking\r\nnew thoughts, and if it is not allowed to teach itself fresh habits, it\r\nwill break out in revolt, and either the government will be broken or the\r\nsubjects will wither away under the rule of repression.\r\n\r\nHobbes may be quoted as a supporter of the rule of the Stuarts, and equally\r\nof the rule of Cromwell. Every kind of strong tyranny may be defended by\r\nhis principles.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth century Carlyle was the finest exponent of \"strong\"\r\ngovernment, and generally the leaders of the Tory party have been its\r\nadvocates, particularly in the attitude to be taken towards subject races.\r\n\r\nJOHN LOCKE (1632-1704)\r\n\r\nLocke, setting out to vindicate the Whig Revolution of 1688, rejects\r\nHobbes' view of the savagery of primitive man, and invents \"a state of\r\npeace, goodwill, mutual assistance and preservation\"--equally, as we know\r\nto-day, far from the truth. Locke's primitive men have a natural right to\r\npersonal property--\"as much land as a man tills, plants, improves,\r\ncultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his property\"--but they\r\nare as worried and as fearful as Hobbes' savages. So they, too, renounce\r\ntheir natural rights in favour of civil liberty, and are happy when they\r\nhave got \"a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society,\r\nand made by the legislative power erected on it.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Hobbes, once having set up a government, there was no possible\r\njustification for changing it--save national peril; and a bad government\r\nwas to be obeyed rather than the danger of civil war incurred.\r\n\r\nBut Locke never allows the government to be more than the trustee of the\r\npeople who placed it in power. It rules by consent of the community, and\r\nmay be removed or altered when it violates its trust. Hobbes saw in the\r\nbreak-up of a particular government the dissolution of society. Locke made\r\na great advance on this, for he saw that a change of government could be\r\naccomplished without any very serious disturbance in the order of society\r\nor the peace of a nation. Hobbes did not believe that the people could be\r\ntrusted to effect a change of government, while Locke had to justify the\r\nchange which had just taken place in 1688.\r\n\r\nOnly when we have dropped all Locke's theories of primitive man's\r\nhappiness, and the social-contract fiction, does the real value of his\r\ndemocratic teaching become clear, and the lasting influence of his work\r\nbecome visible.\r\n\r\nMankind is compelled to adopt some form of government if it is to sleep at\r\nnights without fear of being murdered in its bed, or if it wishes to have\r\nits letters delivered by the postman in the morning. As the only purpose of\r\ngovernment is to secure mutual protection, mankind must obey this\r\ngovernment, or the purpose for which government exists will be defeated.\r\nBut the powers of government must be strictly limited if this necessary\r\nconsent of the governed is to continue, and if the government has ceased to\r\nretain the confidence that gives consent, then its form may be changed to\r\nsome more appropriate shape.\r\n\r\nNow all this theory of Locke's has proved to be true in the progress of\r\nmodern democracy. It was pointed out that the danger of his doctrine--that\r\na nation had the right to choose its form of government, and to change or\r\nadapt its constitution--lay in the sanction it gave to revolution; but\r\nLocke answered that the natural inertia of man was a safeguard against\r\nfrequent and violent political changes, and as far as England was concerned\r\nLocke was right. The average Englishman grumbles, but only under great\r\nprovocation is he moved to violent political activity. As a nation, we have\r\nacknowledged the right of the majority to make the political changes that\r\nhave brought in democracy, and we have accepted the changes loyally.\r\nOccasionally, since Locke, the delay of the government in carrying out the\r\nwishes of the majority has induced impatience, but, generally, the\r\nprinciple has been acted upon that government is carried on with the\r\nconsent of the governed, and that the Parliamentary party which has\r\nreceived the largest number of votes has the authority from the people to\r\nchoose its ministry, and to make laws that all must obey.\r\n\r\nThe power of the people is demonstrated by the free election of members of\r\nParliament, and, therefore, democracy requires that its authority be obeyed\r\nby all who are represented in Parliament. There is no social contract\r\nbetween the voter and the government; but there is a general feeling that\r\nit is not so much participation in politics as the quiet enjoyment of the\r\nprivileges of citizenship that obliges submission to the laws. The\r\nextension of the franchise was necessary whenever a body of people excluded\r\nfrom the electorate was conscious of being unrepresented and desired\r\nrepresentation. Otherwise the consent of the voteless governed was\r\nobviously non-existent, and government was carried on in defiance of the\r\nabsence of that consent.\r\n\r\nIt is not Locke's theories that have guided politically the great masses of\r\nthe people, for Locke's writings have had no very considerable popularity\r\nin England. But it has happened that these theories have influenced the\r\nconduct of statesmen, and with reason, since they offer an explanation of\r\npolitical progress, and constrain politicians to act, experimentally\r\nindeed, but with some reasonable anticipation of safety to the nation.\r\nBritish statesmen and politicians have made no parade of Locke's opinions;\r\nthey have done nothing to incur the charge of \"theorist,\" but the influence\r\nof Locke can be seen all the same--chiefly in the loyal acceptance of\r\npolitical change, in the refusal to be shocked or alarmed at a \"leap in the\r\ndark,\" and by a willingness to adjust the machinery of government to the\r\nneeds of the time. In England Locke's influence has been less dynamic than\r\nstatic; it has helped us to preserve a moderation in politics; to be\r\ncontent with piecemeal legislation, because to attempt too much might be to\r\nalienate the sympathies of the majority; to keep our political eye, so to\r\nspeak, on the ebb and flow of public opinion--since it is public opinion\r\nthat is the final court of appeal; to tolerate abuses until it is quite\r\nplain a great number of people are anxious to have the abuse removed; and\r\nabove all to settle down in easy contentment under political defeat, and\r\nmake the best of accomplished reforms, not because we like them, but\r\nbecause a Parliamentary majority has decreed them.\r\n\r\nFor England, in fact, the essence of Locke's teaching has helped to produce\r\na deference almost servile to political majorities and to public opinion, a\r\nreluctance to make any reform until public opinion has pronounced loudly\r\nand often in favour of reform, and an emphatic assurance that every reform\r\nenacted by Parliament is the unmistakable expression of the will of the\r\npeople. Locke has discouraged us from hasty legislation and from political\r\npanics.\r\n\r\nROUSSEAU AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nLocke's influence in France and in America has been altogether different.\r\nVoltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot were all students and admirers of Locke,\r\nand his political theories were at the base of Rousseau's \"Social\r\nContract.\" A return to nature, a harking back to an imaginary primitive\r\nhappiness of mankind, the glorification of an ideal of simplicity and\r\ninnocence,--supposed to have been the ideal of early politics--the\r\nrestoration of a popular sovereignty built up on natural rights alleged to\r\nhave been lost: these were the articles of faith Rousseau preached with\r\npassionate conviction in his \"Discourses\" and in the \"Social Contract.\"\r\nIndividual man was born naturally \"free,\" and had become debased and\r\nenslaved by laws and civilisation. \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is\r\nin chains,\" is the opening sentence of the \"Social Contract.\" This liberty\r\nand equality of primitive man was acclaimed as a law of nature by\r\neighteenth century writers in France, and to some extent in England too.\r\nPope could write, \"The state of nature was the reign of God.\" Instead of a\r\nforward movement the business of man was to recover the lost happiness of\r\nthe childhood of the world, to bring back a golden age of liberty and\r\nequality. Locke's \"state of peace, goodwill, mutual assistance, and\r\npreservation\" is to be the desire of nations, and with wistful yearning\r\nRousseau's disciples gazed on the picture painted by their master.\r\n\r\nIt was all false, all a fiction, all mischievous and misleading, this\r\ndoctrine of a return to an ideal happiness of the past, and it was the most\r\nworthless portion of Locke's work. To-day it is easy for us to say this,\r\nwhen we have learnt something of the struggle for existence in nature,\r\nsomething of the habits and customs of primitive man, and something of\r\nman's upward growth. But Locke and Rousseau were born before our limited\r\nknowledge of the history of man and his institutions had been learnt;\r\nbefore science, with patient research, had revealed a few incidents in the\r\nlong story of man's ascent. Even the history of Greece and Rome, as\r\nRousseau read it, was hopelessly inaccurate and incomplete. Therefore,\r\nwhile we can see the fallacy in all the eighteenth century teaching\r\nconcerning the natural happiness of uncivilised man, we must at the same\r\ntime remember it as a doctrine belonging to a pre-scientific era. The\r\nexcuse in France, too, for its popularity was great. Civilisation weighed\r\nheavily on the nation. The whole country groaned under a misrule, and\r\ncommerce and agriculture were crippled by the system of taxation. It seemed\r\nthat France was impoverished to maintain a civilisation that only a few,\r\nand they not the most useful members of the community, could enjoy.\r\n\r\nHow mankind had passed from primitive freedom to civilised slavery neither\r\nLocke nor Rousseau inquired. \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in\r\nchains,\" cries Rousseau, in sublime disregard of facts. For man was not\r\nborn free in the ancient republics of Greece and Rome that Rousseau\r\nrevered; children were not born free in his day any more than they are in\r\nours; and any assembly or community of people necessarily involves mutual\r\nconsideration and forbearance which are at once restrictive.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, of course, that man is not born free, but is born with free\r\nwill to work out political freedom or to consent to servitude. He is not\r\nborn with \"natural\" political rights, but born to acquire by law political\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe fiction of primitive man's happiness and of the natural goodness and\r\nfreedom of man did little harm in England, for Locke was not a popular\r\nauthor, and Wesley's religious revival in the eighteenth century laid awful\r\nstress on man's imperfections. The sovereign people ruled in an unreformed\r\nHouse of Commons, and the \"contract\" theory was exhibited by ministers\r\nholding office on the strength of a majority in the Commons.\r\n\r\nRousseau's writings depicted, with a clearness that fascinated the reader,\r\nthe contrast between the ideal state that man had lost and the present\r\ncondition of society with its miseries and corruption; and by its\r\nexplanation of the doctrines of a contract and the sovereignty of the\r\npeople, suggested the way to end these miseries and corruptions. The\r\n\"Social Contract\" became the text-book of the men who made the French\r\nRevolution, and if the success of the Revolution is due to the teaching of\r\nRousseau more than to that of any other French philosopher, the crimes and\r\nmistakes of the Revolution are directly to be traced to his influence, and\r\nthis in spite of Rousseau's deprecation of violence.[73]\r\n\r\nAs there is a certain tendency in England to-day to attempt the\r\nresuscitation of Rousseau's theories of popular sovereignty and the natural\r\nrights of man, and as so distinguished a writer as Mr. Hilaire Belloc is at\r\npains to invite the English working class to seek illumination from\r\nRousseau and to proceed to democracy guided by the speculative political\r\ndoctrines of the eighteenth century rather than on the tried experimental\r\nlines of representative government and an extended franchise, it is\r\nnecessary to devote to Rousseau and his \"Social Contract\" more space than\r\nthe subject deserves.\r\n\r\nThe \"Social Contract\" is full of inaccuracies in its references to history;\r\nit is often self-contradictory, and it has not even the merit of\r\noriginality. From Hobbes Rousseau borrowed the notion of authority in the\r\nState; from Locke the seat of this authority; the nature of the original\r\npact and of citizenship from Spinoza; from the Huguenot Languet the\r\ndoctrine of fraternity; and from Althusius the doctrine of the\r\ninalienability of citizenship. Where Locke was content to maintain that the\r\npeople collectively had the right to change the form of government,\r\nRousseau would give the community continual exercise in sovereignty, while\r\nvoting and representation are signs of democratic decadence in Rousseau's\r\neyes. The sovereign people governing, not through elected representatives\r\nbut by public meeting, has only been found possible in small slave-ridden\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nAt the Revolution France had to elect its deputies. But the theory of the\r\nsovereignty of the people has over and over again, in France, upset the\r\nGovernment, and destroyed the authority of the deputies. In England we\r\naccept the rule of Parliament, and are satisfied that the election of\r\nrepresentatives by an enfranchised people is the most satisfactory form of\r\ndemocracy, though we retain a healthy instinct of criticism of the\r\nGovernment in power. In France has happened what Locke's critics foretold:\r\nthe sovereign people never wholeheartedly delegates its powers to its\r\ndeputies, and indulges in revolution when impatient of government. During\r\nthe Revolution the passionate clamour of the sovereign people overpowered\r\nthe votes and voices of elected representatives, and revolution and\r\nreaction were the rule in France from 1793 to 1871.\r\n\r\nWe may be frankly against the Government all the time in England; we may\r\nresist it actively and passively, for the purpose of calling attention to\r\nsome political grievance, some disability that needs removal. But we never\r\nforget that it is the Government, or believe that it can be overturned save\r\nby the votes of the electorate. At the time of the European revolutions of\r\n1848, when crowns were falling, and ministers flying before the rage of the\r\nsovereign people, Chartism never seriously threatened the stability of the\r\nBritish Government, and its great demonstrations were no real menace to the\r\nexisting order. Nothing seems able to shake the British confidence in its\r\nelected representatives, and in the Government that is supported by a\r\nmajority of those representatives. We have never accepted the gospel of\r\nJean Jacques Rousseau; Priestley and Price are almost the only names that\r\ncan be mentioned as disciples of Rousseau before the advent of Mr. H.\r\nBelloc.\r\n\r\nFrance, still following Rousseau, does not associate political sovereignty\r\nwith representation as England does. It never invests the doings of its\r\nCabinet with a sacred importance, and it readily transfers the reins of\r\ngovernment from Ministry to Ministry. France has submitted to the\r\nsovereignty of an Emperor and to the rule of kings since the great\r\nRevolution, and though its Republic is now forty years old, and at present\r\nthere are no signs of dictatorship on the horizon, the Government of the\r\nRepublic is never safe from a revolutionary rising of the sovereign people,\r\nand only by the strength of its army has revolution been kept at bay. If\r\nLouis XVI. had possessed the army of modern France he too might have kept\r\nthe revolution at bay. All this revolution and reaction, disbelief in the\r\nauthority of representative government, and lively conviction that\r\nsovereignty is with the citizens, and must be asserted from time to\r\ntime--to the confusion of deputies and delegates--is Rousseau's work, the\r\nreaping of the harvest sown by the \"Social Contract.\" Let us sum up the\r\ncharacter of Rousseau's work, and then leave him and his doctrines for ever\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\n\"Rousseau's scheme is that of a doctrinaire who is unconscious of the\r\ninfinite variety and complexity of life, and its apparent simplicity is\r\nmainly due to his inability to realise and appreciate the difficulties of\r\nhis task. He evinced no insight into the political complications of his\r\ntime; and his total ignorance of affairs, together with his contempt for\r\ncivilised life, prevented him from framing a theory of any practical\r\nutility. Indeed, the disastrous attempt of the Jacobins to apply his\r\nprinciples proved how valueless and impracticable most of his doctrines\r\nwere. He never attempted to trace social and political evils to their\r\ncauses, in order to suggest suitable modifications of existing conditions.\r\nHe could not see how impossible it was to sweep away all institutions and\r\nimpose a wholly new social order irrespective of the natures, faculties,\r\nand desires of those whom he wished to benefit; on the contrary, he\r\nexaggerates the passivity and plasticity of men and circumstances, and\r\ndreams that his model legislator, who apparently is to initiate the new\r\nsociety, will be able to repress all anti-social feelings. He aims at order\r\nand symmetry, oblivious that human nature does not easily and rapidly bend\r\nto such treatment. It is his inability to discover the true mode of\r\ninvestigation that accounts for much of Rousseau's sophistry. His truisms\r\nand verbal propositions, his dogmatic assertions and unreal demonstrations,\r\nsavour more of theology than of political science, while his\r\nquasi-mathematical method of reasoning from abstract formulæ, assumed to be\r\naxiomatic, gives a deceptive air of exactness and cogency which is apt to\r\nbe mistaken for sound logic. He supports glaring paradoxes with an array of\r\ningenious arguments, and with fatal facility and apparent precision he\r\ndeduces from his unfounded premises a series of inconsequent conclusions,\r\nwhich he regards as authoritative and universally applicable. At times he\r\nbecomes less rigid, as when (under the influence of Montesquieu) he studies\r\nthe relations between the physical constitution of a nation, its territory,\r\nits customs, its form of government, and its deep-rooted opinions, or avows\r\nthat there has been too much dispute about the forms of government. But\r\nsuch considerations are not prominent. In certain cases his inconsistencies\r\nmay be due to re-handling, but he is said to have observed that those who\r\nboasted of understanding the whole contract were more clever than he.\"[74]\r\n\r\nThis may sound very severe, but it is entirely just. The \"Social Contract\"\r\nconsists of four books: (1) The founding of the civilized state by a social\r\npact. (2) The theory of the sovereignty of the people. (3) and (4). The\r\ndifferent forms of government; the indestructible character of the general\r\nwill of the community; and civil religion.\r\n\r\nThe whole work teems with generalisations, mostly ill-founded, and the\r\ndetails are not in agreement. The one thing of permanent value is the\r\nconception that the State represents the \"general will\" of the community.\r\nHow that \"general will\" finds expression and gets its way is of great\r\nimportance to democracy. Even more important is the nature of that \"general\r\nwill.\" Individualist as Rousseau was in his views about personal property\r\n(following Locke in an apparent ideal of peasant proprietorship), he\r\ninsisted on the subjection of personal rights to the safety of the\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the American colonies to the British Government did not\r\ncommence with any spirit of independence. The tea incident at Boston took\r\nplace in 1773, and it was not till three years later that the Declaration\r\nof Independence was drawn up. The Whig principles of 1688 are at the\r\nfoundation of American liberties, and Locke's influence is to be seen both\r\nin the Declaration of Independence and in the American constitution. The\r\ncolonists from the first had in many states a Puritanism that was hostile\r\nto the prerogatives of governors, and appeals to the British Government\r\nagainst the misuse of the prerogative were generally successful. The\r\ncolonists wanted no more, and no less, than the constitutional rights\r\nenjoyed by Englishmen in Great Britain, and while the Whigs were in power\r\nthese rights were fairly secure. George III., attempting a reversion to\r\nmonarchist rule, drove the colonists to war and to seek independence; with\r\nthe aid of France this independence was won.\r\n\r\nIf the French officers who assisted the Americans brought the doctrines of\r\nRousseau to the revolted colonists, which is possible, it is quite certain\r\nthat the establishment of the American Republic, and the principles of La\r\nFayette and Paine, who had fought in the American War, were not without\r\neffect in France.\r\n\r\nThe American Constitution was the work of men who believed in democratic\r\ngovernment as Locke had defined it, and America has been the biggest\r\nexperiment in democracy the world has seen. The fact that the President and\r\nhis Cabinet are not members of Congress makes the great distinction between\r\nthe British and American Constitution. The College of Electors is elected\r\nonly to elect the President; that done, its work is over. Congress,\r\nconsisting of members elected from each state, and the Senate, consisting\r\nof representatives from each state, need not contain a majority of the\r\nPresident's party, and the President is in no way responsible to Congress\r\nas the British Prime Minister is to the House of Commons. The relation of\r\nthe State Governments to the Federal Government has presented the chief\r\ndifficulty to democracy in America.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, or Republicans, as they came to be called, stood for a strong\r\nFederal Government; the Democrats were jealous for the rights of State\r\nGovernments. The issue was not decided till the Civil War of 1861-1865,\r\nwhen the southern slave-holding States, seeing slavery threatened,\r\nannounced their secession from the United States. Abraham Lincoln, the\r\nnewly-elected President, declared that the Government could not allow\r\nsecession, and insisted that the war was to save the union. Slavery was\r\nabolished and the Union saved by the defeat of the Secessionists; but for a\r\ntime the fortunes of the Union were more desperate than they had been at\r\nany time since the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nHamilton was the real founder of the Republican party, as Jefferson was of\r\nthe Democrats. Both these men were prominent in the making of the American\r\nConstitution in 1787, and Jefferson was the responsible author of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. But Franklin and Paine made large\r\ncontributions to the democratic independence of America.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PAINE (1737-1809)\r\n\r\nEdmund Randolph, the first Attorney-General of the United States, was on\r\nWashington's staff at the beginning of the War, and he ascribed\r\nindependence in the first place to George III., but next to \"Thomas Paine,\r\nan Englishman by birth.\"[75]\r\n\r\nPaine's later controversies with theological opponents have obscured his\r\nvery considerable services to American Independence, to political democracy\r\nin England, and to constitutional government in the French Revolution; and\r\nas mankind is generally, and naturally, more interested in religion than in\r\npolitics, Paine is remembered rather as an \"infidel\"--though he was a\r\nstrong theist--than as a gifted writer on behalf of democracy and a\r\npolitical reformer of original powers.\r\n\r\nPaine--who came of a Suffolk Quaker family--reached America in 1774, on the\r\nvery threshold of the war. His Quaker principles made him attack negro\r\nslavery on his arrival, and he endeavoured, without success, to get an\r\nanti-slavery clause inserted in the \"Declaration of Independence.\" He\r\nserved in the American ranks during the war, and was the friend of\r\nWashington, who recognised the value of his writings. For Paine's \"Common\r\nSense\" pamphlet and his publication, \"The Crisis,\" had enormous\r\ncirculation, and were of the greatest value in keeping the spirit of\r\nindependence alive in the dark years of the war. They were fiercely\r\nRepublican; and though they were not entirely free from contemporary\r\nnotions of government established on the ruins of a lost innocence, they\r\nstruck a valiant note of self-reliance, and emphasised the importance of\r\nthe average honest man. \"Time makes more converts than reason,\" wrote\r\nPaine. Of monarchy he could say, \"The fate of Charles I. hath only made\r\nkings more subtle--not more just\"; and, \"Of more worth is one honest man to\r\nsociety, and in the sight of God, than all the crowned ruffians that ever\r\nlived.\"\r\n\r\nPaine was in England in 1787, busy with scientific inventions, popular in\r\nWhig circles and respected. The fall of the Bastille won his applause, as\r\nit did the applause of Fox and the Whigs, but it was not till the\r\npublication of Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France,\" in 1790,\r\nthat Paine again took up his pen on behalf of democracy.\r\n\r\nBurke had been the hero of Paine and the Americans in the War of\r\nIndependence, and his speeches and writings had justified the republic. And\r\nnow it was the political philosophy of Hobbes that Burke seemed to be\r\ncontending for when he insisted that the English people were bound for ever\r\nto royalty by the act of allegiance to William III.\r\n\r\nPaine replied to Burke the following year with the \"Rights of Man\" which he\r\nwrote in a country inn, the \"Angel,\" at Islington. It was not so much to\r\ndemolish Burke as to give the English nation a constitution that Paine\r\ndesired; for it seemed to the author of \"Common Sense\" that, America having\r\nrenounced monarchy and set up a republican form of government, safely\r\nguarded by a written constitution, England must be anxious to do the same\r\nthing, and was only in need of a constitution.\r\n\r\nThe flamboyant rhetoric of the American Declaration of Independence--\"We\r\nhold these truths to be self-evident--that all men are created equal; that\r\nthey are endowed by the Creator with inalienable rights; that among these\r\nare life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\"--was not the sort of\r\nlanguage that appealed to English Whigs (America itself cheerfully admitted\r\nthe falseness of the statement by keeping the negro in slavery), and the\r\nglittering generalities of the \"Rights of Man\" made no impression on the\r\nWhig leaders in Parliament. Paine was back in the old regions of a social\r\ncontract, and of a popular sovereignty antecedent to government. It was all\r\nbeside the mark, this talk of a popular right inherent in the nation, a\r\nright that gave the power to make constitutional changes not _through_\r\nelected representatives in Parliament, but by a general convention.\r\nParliament in the sight of the Whigs was the sovereign assembly holding its\r\nauthority from the people, and only by a majority in the House of Commons\r\ncould the people express its will. What made the \"Rights of Man\" popular\r\nwith the English democrats of the \"Constitutional Society\" and the\r\nsympathisers with the French Revolution was not so much the old\r\npre-historic popular \"sovereignty\" fiction--though it is true that there\r\nwere many Englishmen, of whom Godwin was one, who could see no hope of\r\nParliament reforming itself or of granting any measure of enfranchisement\r\nto the people, and therefore were willing to fall back on any theory for\r\ncompelling Parliament to move towards a more liberal constitution--as the\r\nprogramme of practical reforms that was unfolded in its pages and the\r\nhonest defence of the proceedings in Paris. That Parliament had no right to\r\nbind posterity, as Burke maintained, and that if the revolution of 1688 was\r\nauthoritative, why should a revolution in 1788 be less authoritative? were\r\nmatters of less interest than the clear statement of events in France, and\r\nthe proposals for a democratic constitution in England and for social\r\nreform. Fifty thousand copies of the \"Rights of Man\" were quickly sold, and\r\nit obtained a large number of readers in America, and was translated into\r\nFrench. The total sales were estimated at 200,000 in 1793. Paine followed\r\nit up with Part II. while he was an elected member of the National\r\nConvention in Paris, and in 1792, when a cheap edition of the \"Rights of\r\nMan\" was issued, its author was tried for high treason, and in his absence\r\nconvicted and outlawed.\r\n\r\nPart I. of the \"Rights of Man,\" while relying on the popular \"sovereignty\"\r\nfiction for getting a national convention, contained a careful definition\r\nof representative government. It showed that government by democracy--i.e.\r\nby popular meeting, suitable enough for small and primitive societies--must\r\ndegenerate into hopeless confusion in a large population; that monarchy and\r\naristocracy which sprang from the political confusion of the people must\r\ndegenerate into incapacity. A representative government was the control of\r\na nation by persons elected by the whole nation, and the Rights of Man were\r\nthe rights of all to this representation.\r\n\r\nAs a nation we have never admitted any \"natural\" political rights to man,\r\nbut we have steadily insisted on the constitutional right of representation\r\nin Parliament to those who possess a fixed abode and contribute by taxation\r\nto the national revenue.\r\n\r\nPaine attacked all hereditary authority and all titles, but approved a\r\ndouble chamber for Parliament. He claimed that the whole nation ought to\r\ndecide on the question of war with a foreign country, and urged that no\r\nmember of Parliament should be a government pensioner.\r\n\r\nIn Part II. there is a confident announcement that \"monarchy and\r\naristocracy will not continue seven years longer in any of the enlightened\r\ncountries of Europe,\" so sure was Paine that civilised mankind would hasten\r\nto follow the examples of France and America, and summon national\r\nconventions for the making of republican constitutions. As the old form of\r\ngovernment had been hereditary, the new form was to be elective and\r\nrepresentative. The money hitherto spent on the Crown was to be devoted to\r\na national system of elementary education--all children remaining at school\r\ntill the age of 14--and to old-age pensions for all over 60. It is in these\r\nfinancial proposals and the suggested social reforms that Paine is seen as\r\na pioneer of democracy. A progressive income tax is included in this Part\r\nII., the tax to be graduated from 3d. in the £ on incomes between £50 to\r\n£500; 6d. on incomes between £500 and £1,000; an additional 6d. up to\r\n£4,000; and then 1s. on every additional £1,000 until we get to an income\r\ntax of 20s. in the £ on an income of £22,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of Paine's proposals in England and the Reign of Terror in\r\nFrance frightened the British Government into a policy of fierce\r\npersecution against all who bought, sold, lent or borrowed the \"Rights of\r\nMan.\" \"Constitutional Societies\" were suppressed, and all who dared openly\r\nexpress sympathy with revolutions or republics were promptly arrested.\r\n\r\nPaine, outlawed by the British Government, contended in the National\r\nConvention for a republican constitution for France, did his best to\r\nprevent the execution of Louis XVI., fell with the Girondins, was thrown\r\ninto prison, and only escaped with his life by an accident. Then, under the\r\nvery shadow of the guillotine Paine wrote his \"Age of Reason,\" to recall\r\nFrance from atheism to a mild humanitarian theism. This book was fatal to\r\nPaine's reputation. Henceforth the violent denunciation of theological\r\nopponents pursued him to the grave, and left his name a byword to the\r\northodox. As Paine's contribution to the body of democratic belief in the\r\n\"Rights of Man\" was submerged in the discussion on his religious opinions,\r\nso was his early plea for what he called \"Agrarian Justice.\" On his release\r\nfrom a prison cell in the Luxembourg, in 1795, Paine published his \"Plan\r\nfor a National Fund.\" This plan was an anticipation of our modern proposals\r\nfor Land Reform. Paine urged the taxation of land values--the payment to\r\nthe community of a ground-rent--and argued for death duties as \"the least\r\ntroublesome method\" of raising revenue. It was in the preface to this\r\npamphlet on \"Agrarian Justice\" that Paine replied to Bishop Watson's sermon\r\non \"The Wisdom and Goodness of God in having made both Rich and Poor.\" \"It\r\nis wrong,\" wrote Paine, \"to say God made rich and poor; He made only male\r\nand female, and gave them the earth for their inheritance.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon organised the plebiscite, which conferred on him the Consulate for\r\nlife, in 1802, and the French Revolution and Constitution making having\r\nyielded to a military dictatorship, Paine returned to America, and died in\r\nNew York in 1809.\r\n\r\nMAJOR CARTWRIGHT AND THE \"RADICAL REFORMERS\"\r\n\r\nJohn Cartwright, the \"Father of Reform,\" is notable as the first of the\r\nEnglish \"Radical Reformers.\" His direct influence on politics was\r\nsmall--none of his writings had the success of the \"Rights of Man\"--but,\r\nlike Paine, he laboured to turn England by public opinion from aristocracy\r\nto democracy, and for more than forty years Cartwright was to the fore with\r\nhis programme of Radical reform. The problem for Cartwright and the Radical\r\nreformers was how to get the changes made which would give political power\r\nto the people--with whom was the sovereignty, as they had learnt from\r\nLocke--and make Parliament the instrument of democracy. A hundred years and\r\nmore have not sufficed to get this problem answered to everybody's\r\nsatisfaction, but in the latter part of the eighteenth century, to the\r\nminds of simple, honest men, it seemed enough that the argument should be\r\nstated plainly and reasonably; it would follow that all mankind would be\r\nspeedily convinced; so great was the faith in the power of reason.\r\n\r\nWhat neither Cartwright nor Paine understood was, that it was not the\r\nreasonableness of a proposed reform but the strength of the demand that\r\ncarried the day. The revolt and independence of the American Colonies were\r\nnot due to a political preference for a republic, but were the work of\r\npublic opinion driven by misgovernment to protest. The difficulty in\r\nEngland was that the mass of people might be in great wretchedness, badly\r\nhoused, ill-fed, and generally neglected, but they were not conscious of\r\nany desire for democracy. They were against the government, doubtless, and\r\nwilling enough, in London, to shout for \"Wilkes and Liberty,\" but the time\r\nhad not yet come for the working class to believe that enfranchisement was\r\na remedy for the ills they endured.\r\n\r\nMajor Cartwright was an exceedingly fine type of man; conscientious, public\r\nspirited, humane, and utterly without personal ambition. He resigned his\r\ncommission in the Navy because he believed it wrong to fight against the\r\nAmerican Colonies, and he organised a county militia for the sake of\r\nnational defence. On the pedestal beneath his statue in Cartwright Gardens,\r\njust south of Euston Road, in London, the virtues of the \"Father of Reform\"\r\nare described at length, and he is mentioned as \"the firm, consistent and\r\npersevering advocate of _universal suffrage_, equal representation, vote by\r\nballot, and annual Parliaments.\" It was in 1777 that Cartwright published\r\nhis first pamphlet entitled \"Legislative Rights Vindicated,\" and pleaded\r\nfor \"a return to the ancient and constitutional practice of Edward III.\"\r\nand the election of annual Parliaments. Long Parliaments were the root of\r\nall social political evil, Cartwright argued. War, national debt, distress,\r\ndepopulation, land out of cultivation, Parliamentary debate itself become a\r\nmockery--these calamities were all due to long Parliaments; and would be\r\ncured if once a year--on June 1st--a fresh Parliament was elected by the\r\nvotes of every man over eighteen--by ballot and without any plural\r\nvoting--and a payment of two guineas a day was made to members on their\r\nattendance. Of course, Cartwright could not help writing \"all are by nature\r\nfree, all are by nature equal\"--no political reformer in the eighteenth\r\ncentury could do otherwise--but, unlike his contemporaries, the Major was a\r\nstout Christian, and insisted that as the whole plan of Christianity was\r\nfounded on the equality of all mankind, political rights must have the same\r\nfoundation. By the political axiom that \"no man shall be taxed but with his\r\nown consent, given either by himself or his own representative in\r\nParliament,\" Cartwright may be quoted as one who had some perception of\r\nwhat democracy meant in England; but he is off the track again in arguing\r\nthat personality, and not the possession of property, was the sole\r\nfoundation of the right of being represented in Parliament. It was the\r\npossession of property that brought taxation, and with taxation the right\r\nto representation. We cannot repeat too often that in England the progress\r\nto democracy has never been made on assumptions of an abstract right to\r\nvote. We have come to democracy by experience, and this experience has\r\ntaught us that people who are taxed insist, sooner or later, on having a\r\nvoice in the administration of the national exchequer. But we have never\r\nadmitted \"personality\" as a title to enfranchisement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GORDON RIOTS\r\n\r\n_From the Painting by Seymour Lucas, R.A._]\r\n\r\nCartwright followed with the multitude of political writers of his time to\r\ndeduce a right to vote, and his deduction is as worthless as the rest of\r\nthe _a priori_ reasoning. But the brave old man--he was tried for\r\n\"sedition\" at the age of eighty in the Government panic of 1820--was an\r\nentirely disinterested champion of the poor and a real lover of liberty. He\r\nbelieved the affairs of government ought to be a matter of common concern,\r\nand that they were quite within the capacities of ordinary men.\r\nCartwright's life--much more than his writings--kept the democratic ideal\r\nunshaken in the handful of \"Radical Reformers\" who survived the Tory\r\nreaction on the war with the French Republic in 1793, and his glowing\r\nenthusiasm helped to kindle the fire for political enfranchisement that was\r\nburning in the hearts of the manufacturing population by 1818. But in 1777\r\nthe electorate was not anxious for reform, and the unenfranchised gave no\r\nthought to their political disabilities. On the very day in 1780 that the\r\nDuke of Richmond proposed, in the House of Lords, a resolution in favour of\r\nmanhood suffrage and annual Parliaments, the London mob, stirred up by the\r\nanti-Catholic fanaticism of Lord George Gordon, marched to Westminster with\r\na petition to repeal Savile's Act of 1778, which allowed Catholics to\r\nbequeath land and to educate their own children. There was a riot, and in\r\nthe course of the next six days the mob burnt Newgate, sacked Catholic\r\nchapels, and generally plundered and ravaged the City.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons Pitt made three attempts to get reform\r\nconsidered--in 1782, 1783 and 1785--and on each occasion his resolution was\r\ndefeated by an overwhelming majority. After that Pitt made no further\r\neffort for reform, and from 1793 to 1795 the Government he led passed the\r\nActs of repressive legislation which made all democratic propaganda\r\nillegal, and crushed all political agitation.\r\n\r\nBut \"the Cause\" was not dead.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Burdett, M.P. for Westminster, Henry Hunt, better known as\r\n\"Orator Hunt,\" and Cobbett with his \"Political Register,\" in various ways\r\nrenewed the campaign for manhood suffrage, and the growth of the\r\nmanufacturing districts made a change in the constitution of Parliament\r\nimperative.\r\n\r\nBurdett was sent to the Tower in 1810 for contempt of Parliament, but lived\r\nto see the Reform Bill of 1831 passed into law, and died a Tory. Cobbett\r\nspent two years in prison, and became M.P. for Oldham in 1832. What Cobbett\r\ndid with pen--and no man at that day wrote with greater ability for the\r\ncommon people, or with greater acceptance--Hunt did on the platform. Both\r\nstrove to arouse the working class to demand enfranchisement. Hunt presided\r\nat the mass meeting at Peterloo, by Manchester, in 1819--an entirely\r\npeaceful meeting which was broken up by the military with some loss of\r\nlife--and was sent to prison for two years for doing so. He also was\r\nelected M.P. (for Preston) in the first reformed Parliament.\r\n\r\nAgain the Government tried coercion, and after Peterloo, for the next few\r\nyears, intimidation and numerous arrests kept down all outward\r\nmanifestation of the reform movement.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, the movement could not be stayed. Each year saw political\r\nindifference changed to positive desire for enfranchisement, and the\r\nBritish public, which, in the main, had been left untouched by the vision\r\nof a democracy and the call for a national convention and a new\r\nconstitution, became impatient for the reform of Parliament and the\r\nrepresentation of the manufacturing interest.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SPENCE (1750-1814)\r\n\r\nThe name of Spence must be mentioned amongst those who preached the\r\ndemocratic idea at the close of the eighteenth century. A Newcastle\r\nschoolmaster, Spence, in 1775, expounded his \"Plan\" for land\r\nnationalisation on the following lines:--\r\n\r\n\"The land, with all that appertains to it, is in every parish made the\r\nproperty of the Corporation or parish, with as ample power to let, repair,\r\nor alter all or any part thereof, as a lord of the manor enjoys over his\r\nlands, houses, etc.; but the power of alienating the least morsel, in any\r\nmanner, from the parish, either at this or any time thereafter, is denied.\r\nFor it is solemnly agreed to, by the whole nation, that a parish that shall\r\neither sell or give away any part of its landed property shall be looked\r\nupon with as much horror and detestation as if they had sold all their\r\nchildren to be slaves, or massacred them with their own hands. Thus are\r\nthere no more or other landlords in the whole country than the parishes,\r\nand each of them is sovereign lord of its territories.\r\n\r\n\"Then you may behold the rent which the people have paid into the parish\r\ntreasuries employed by each parish in paying the Parliament or National\r\nCongress at any time grants; in maintaining and relieving its own poor\r\npeople out of work; in paying the necessary officers their salaries; in\r\nbuilding, repairing, and adorning its houses, bridges, and other\r\nstructures; in making and maintaining convenient and delightful streets,\r\nhighways, and passages both for foot and carriages; in making and\r\nmaintaining canals and other conveniences for trade and navigation; in\r\nplanting and taking in waste grounds; in providing and keeping up a\r\nmagazine of ammunition and all sorts of arms sufficient for all the\r\ninhabitants in case of danger from enemies; in premiums for the\r\nencouragement of agriculture, or anything else thought worthy of\r\nencouragement; and, in a word, doing whatever the people think proper, and\r\nnot as formerly, to support and spread luxury, pride, and all manner of\r\nvice.\"\r\n\r\nNo taxes of any kind were to be paid by native or foreigner \"but the\r\naforesaid rent, which every person pays to the parish according to the\r\nquantity, quality, and conveniences of the land, housing, etc., which he\r\noccupies in it. The Government, poor, roads, etc., are all maintained by\r\nthe parishes with the rent, on which account all wares, manufactures,\r\nallowable trade employments, or actions are entirely duty free.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Plan\" ends with the usual confidence of the idealist reformer of the\r\ntime in the speedy triumph of right, and in the world-wide acceptance of\r\nwhat seemed to its author so eminently reasonable a proposal.\r\n\r\n\"What makes this prospect yet more glowing is that after this empire of\r\nright and reason is thus established it will stand for ever. Force and\r\ncorruption attempting its downfall shall equally be baffled, and all other\r\nnations, struck with wonder and admiration at its happiness and stability,\r\nshall follow the example; and thus the whole earth shall at last be happy,\r\nand live like brethren.\"\r\n\r\nThe American War and the French Revolution hindered the consideration of\r\nSpence's \"empire of right and reason,\" but, in the course of nearly forty\r\nyears' advocacy of land nationalisation, Spence gathered round him a band\r\nof disciples in London, and the Spenceans were a recognised body of\r\nreformers in the early part of the nineteenth century. The attacks on\r\nprivate property in land, and the revolutionary proposals for giving the\r\nlandlords notice to quit, brought down the wrath of the Government on\r\nSpence, and he was constantly being arrested, fined and imprisoned for\r\n\"seditious libel,\" while his bookshop in Holborn was as frequently\r\nransacked by the authorities.\r\n\r\nSpence died in 1814, and the movement for abolishing the landlords in\r\nfavour of common ownership languished and stopped. The interesting thing\r\nabout Spence's \"Plan\" is its anticipation of Henry George's propaganda for\r\na Single Tax on Land Values, and the extinction of all other methods of\r\nraising national revenue, a propaganda that, in a modified form for the\r\ntaxation of land values, has already earned the approval of the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL POLITICS AND DEMOCRATIC IDEALS\r\n\r\nBecause we insist on the experimental character of our British political\r\nprogress, and the steady refusal to accept speculative ideas and _a priori_\r\ndeductions in politics, it does not follow that the services of the\r\nidealist are to be unrecognised.\r\n\r\nThe work of the idealist, whether he is a writer or a man of action--and\r\nsometimes, as in the case of Mazzini, he is both--is to stir the souls of\r\nmen and shake them out of sluggish torpor, or rouse them from gross\r\nabsorption in personal gain, and from dull, self-satisfied complacency. He\r\nis the prophet, the agitator, the pioneer, and after him follow the\r\nresponsible statesmen, who rarely see far ahead or venture on new paths.\r\nOnce or twice in the world's history the practical statesman is an\r\nidealist, as Abraham Lincoln was, but the combination of qualities is\r\nunusual. The political idealist gets his vision in solitary places, the\r\ndemocratic statesman gets his experience of men by rubbing shoulders with\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\nA democratic nation must have its seers and prophets, lest it forget its\r\nhigh calling to press forward, and so sink in the slough of contented ease.\r\nThe preacher of ideals is the architect of a nation's hopes and desires,\r\nand the fulfilment of these hopes and desires will depend on the wisdom of\r\nits political builders--the practical politicians. Often enough the\r\nstructural alterations are so extensive that the architect does not\r\nrecognise his plan; and that is probably as it should be; for it is quite\r\nlikely that the architect left out of account so simple a matter as the\r\nstaircase in his house beautiful, and the builder is bound to adapt the\r\nplan to ordinary human needs.\r\n\r\nThe idealist has a faith in the future of his cause that exceeds the\r\naverage faith, and in his sure confidence fails to understand why his\r\nneighbours will not follow at his call, or move more rapidly; and so he\r\nfails as a practical leader.\r\n\r\nHere the work of the statesman and politician comes in. They are nearer to\r\nthe mass of people, they hold their authority by election of the people,\r\nand they understand that the rate of speed must be slow. Under the guidance\r\nof their political leaders, the people are willing to move.\r\n\r\nSometimes the idealist is frankly revolutionary, is for beginning anew in\r\npolitics, and starting society all over again. If the state of things is\r\nbad enough, he may get into power, as he did in France at the Revolution,\r\nand for a time the world will stagger at his doings. But there is no\r\nbeginning _de novo_ in politics, and the revolutions wrought by men who\r\nwould give the world an entirely fresh start (to be distinguished from mere\r\nchanges of dynasty, such as our English Revolution was) have their sandy\r\nfoundations washed away by the floods of reaction.\r\n\r\nThere is no such absolute escape from the past for men or nations, and we\r\ncan only build our new social and political order on the foundations of\r\nexperience. But we may not be moved to build at all but for the prophet and\r\nthe agitator, and therefore the instinct that makes governments slay or\r\nimprison the political agitator and suppress the writings of political\r\nprophets can be understood. For the existence of every government is\r\nthreatened by prophets and agitators, and in self-defence it resists\r\ninnovation. A healthy democracy will allow too many opportunities for\r\npopular expression to fear innovation; yet even under a democracy the\r\nprophets have been stoned--their sepulchres to be subsequently erected by\r\npublic subscription and handsomely decorated.\r\n\r\nDemocracy owes too much to its prophets in the past not to rejoice at their\r\npresence in its midst. But it will prudently leave the direction of its\r\npublic affairs to men who, less gifted it may be in finding new paths, are\r\nmore experienced in making the roads that others have discovered fit for\r\nthe heavy tread of multitudes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY REFORM AND THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nTHE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nThe industrial revolution of the eighteenth century changed the face of\r\nEngland and brought to the manufacturing class wealth and prominence. The\r\npopulation of Lancashire was not more than 300,000 in 1760, the West Riding\r\nof Yorkshire about 360,000, and the total population of England 6,000,000.\r\nThe inventions of Arkwright, Hargreaves, Crompton, Watt, and Cartwright\r\nrevolutionised the cotton trade in the last twenty years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and increased enormously the production of woollen goods. England\r\nceased to be mainly a nation of farmers and merchants; domestic manufacture\r\ngave way to the factory system; the labouring people, unable to make a\r\nliving in the country, gathered into the towns. The long series of\r\nEnclosure Acts--1760-1843--turned seven million acres of common land into\r\nprivate property, and with this change in agrarian conditions and the\r\ngrowth of population England ceased to be a corn-exporting country, and\r\nbecame dependent on foreign nations for its food supply.\r\n\r\nWhile these industrial and agrarian changes meant a striking increase in\r\nwealth and population, they were accompanied by untold misery to the common\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of the small master working in his own home with his one or two\r\napprentices and journeymen, the rich capitalist-employer with his army of\r\nfactory hands grew up. Many of these masters were rough, illiterate and\r\nhard, though shrewd and far-seeing in business. The workmen were forced to\r\nwork for long hours in dark, dirty and unwholesome workshops. The State did\r\nnothing to protect them; the masters only thought of their profits; the\r\nnational conscience was dead, and unjust laws prevented them combining\r\ntogether in trade unions to help themselves. Women and children were made\r\nto work as long and as hard as the men. A regular system grew up of\r\ntransporting pauper and destitute children to weary factory work. There was\r\nno care for their health. There were few churches and chapels, though the\r\nMethodists often did something to prevent the people from falling back into\r\nheathendom. The workmen were ignorant, brutal, poor and oppressed. There\r\nwere no schools and plenty of public houses. In hard times distress was\r\nwidespread, and the workmen naturally listened to agitators and fanatics,\r\nor took to violent means of avenging their wrongs, for they had no\r\nconstitutional means of redress. Even the masters had no votes, as the new\r\ntowns sent no members to Parliament. The transfer of the balance of\r\npopulation and wealth from the south and east to the north and Midlands\r\nmade Parliamentary reform necessary.\"[76]\r\n\r\nWith this transfer of the balance of economic power came a good deal of\r\nrivalry between the manufacturers and the landed gentry, the latter\r\nbecoming more and more Tory, the former more and more Radical. As all\r\npolitical power, in the main, was in the landowner's hands, men anxious to\r\ntake part in politics eagerly bought up the small estates, and the old\r\nyeoman class disappeared, except in out-of-the-way places. These yeomen and\r\nsmall landowners had been the backbone of the Parliamentary Party in the\r\ndays of the Stuarts, but they were left hopelessly behind in an age of\r\nmechanical inventions and agrarian changes, and were in most cases glad to\r\nsell out and invest their property in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe story of the misery of rural depopulation in the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century repeats itself at the close of the eighteenth.\r\n\r\n\"A single farmer held as one farm the lands that once formed fourteen\r\nfarms, bringing up respectably fourteen families. The capitalist farmer\r\ncame in like the capitalist employer. His gangs of poor and ignorant\r\nlabourers were the counterpart of the swarm of factory hands. The business\r\nof farming was worked more scientifically, with better tools and greater\r\nsuccess; but after the middle of the eighteenth century the condition of\r\nthe agricultural labourer got no better, and now the great mass of the\r\nrural population were mere labourers.... Pauperism became more and more a\r\npressing evil, especially after 1782, when _Gilbert's Act_ abolished the\r\nworkhouse test (which compelled all who received relief from the rates to\r\ngo into the half-imprisonment of a poor-house), and the system of poor law\r\ndoles in aid of wages was encouraged by the high prices at the end of the\r\ncentury. In 1803 one-seventh of the people was in receipt of poor law\r\nrelief.\"[77]\r\n\r\nBut with all the considerable distress, in town and country alike amongst\r\nthe working people, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, swift\r\nprogress was taking place in agriculture and in manufactures. Only, the\r\naccumulated wealth fell into fewer hands, and the fluctuations in the\r\ndemand for goods, caused partly by the opening up of new markets, brought\r\nsuccessions of good times and bad times. \"The workmen shared but partially\r\nin the prosperity, and were the first to bear the brunt of hard times.\"[78]\r\n\r\nTHE NEED FOR PARLIAMENTARY REFORM\r\n\r\nThe point for us to note here is that the changed economic conditions made\r\nParliamentary reform a necessity, and brought the question of popular\r\nenfranchisement within sight. It was useless for Burke to maintain the\r\nincomparable beauty of the British constitution; English politicians might\r\nbe indifferent to political theories of democracy, and heartily dislike any\r\nnotion of radical change, but the abuses were too obvious to prevent\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nWhatever the size of the county it returned two members elected by\r\nfreeholders, and the cost of a county election was enormous. Some of the\r\nboroughs, especially in Cornwall, were tiny villages. Eighteen members were\r\nreturned from such boroughs in that part of Cornwall which now returns one\r\nmember for the Liskeard Division. The fields of Old Sarum belonged to seven\r\nelectors and returned two members. As there was no habitation whatever in\r\nthis \"borough\" of Old Sarum, a tent was put up for the convenience of the\r\nreturning officer at election times. No general law decided the borough\r\nfranchise. Local custom and various political and personal considerations\r\nsettled who should vote for members of Parliament. Places like Westminster\r\nand Preston had practically manhood suffrage. In most of the \"corporation\r\nboroughs\" the franchise was restricted exclusively to freemen of the\r\nborough, and to the self-elected non-resident persons who composed the\r\ngoverning body before the Municipal Corporation Act of 1835. A small number\r\nof rich and powerful men really worked nearly all the elections. Seats were\r\nopenly bought and sold, and a candidate had either to find a patron who\r\nwould provide him with a seat, or, failing a patron, to purchase a seat\r\nhimself. Fox first entered Parliament for the pocket borough of Midhurst,\r\nand Sir George Trevelyan has described how it took place. Midhurst was\r\nselected by the father of Charles James Fox as \"the most comfortable of\r\nconstituencies from the point of view of a representative; for the right of\r\nelection rested in a few small holdings, on which no human being resided,\r\ndistinguished among the pastures and the stubble that surrounded them by a\r\nlarge stone set up on end in the middle of each portion. These burbage\r\ntenures, as they were called, had all been bought up by a single\r\nproprietor, Viscount Montagu, who when an election was in prospect,\r\nassigned a few of them to his servants, with instructions to nominate the\r\nmembers and then make back the property to their employer. This ceremony\r\nwas performed in March, 1768, and the steward of the estate, who acted as\r\nthe returning officer, declared that Charles James Fox had been duly chosen\r\nas one of the burgesses for Midhurst, at a time when that young gentleman\r\nwas still amusing himself in Italy.\"\r\n\r\nThree years earlier Burke had entered Parliament as a nominee of Lord\r\nRockingham's. Gibbon sat in the House for some years under patronage.\r\nGladstone first became a member by presentation to a pocket borough, and\r\nlater spoke in praise of this method of bringing young men of promise into\r\nParliament. John Wilson Croker estimated that of six hundred and\r\nfifty-eight members of the House of Commons at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, two hundred and seventy-six were returned by patrons. Men of more\r\nindependence of mind who could afford to buy seats did so, and many of the\r\nreformers--including Burdett, Romilly and Hume--thus sat in the House.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING CENTRES UNREPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nIt was not so much that the landowning aristocracy were over-represented in\r\nParliament by their control of so many pocket boroughs, as that great\r\nmanufacturing centres were entirely unrepresented. The middle-class\r\nmanufacturers had no means of making their influence felt in the unreformed\r\nHouse of Commons, for towns of such importance as Leeds, Manchester and\r\nBirmingham sent no representatives to Parliament. This meant that\r\nParliament was out of touch with all the industrial life of the nation, and\r\nthat nothing was done till after the Reform Act in the way of serious\r\nindustrial legislation.\r\n\r\n35 constituencies with hardly any voters at all returned       75 members\r\n46 constituencies with less than 50 voters in each returned    90    \"\r\n19 constituencies with less than 100 voters in each returned   37    \"\r\n26 constituencies with less than 200 voters in each returned   52    \"\r\n84 male electors in other constituencies returned             157    \"\r\n\r\nThe Reform Act of 1832 changed all this. It disfranchised all boroughs with\r\nless than 2,000 inhabitants--fifty-six in all; allowed one member only to\r\nboroughs with between 2,000 and 4,000; gave representatives to Manchester,\r\nBirmingham, Leeds, and to several other large manufacturing towns and\r\nLondon boroughs; extended the county franchise to leaseholders and £50\r\ntenants at will; and settled the borough franchise on a uniform\r\nqualification of occupation in a house of £10 rateable value. It also fixed\r\ntwo days, instead of fifteen, as the limit for county elections, and one\r\nday for boroughs.\r\n\r\nTHE PASSAGE OF THE GREAT REFORM BILL\r\n\r\nThe Reform Bill was not carried without much rioting in the country, and\r\nsome loss of life.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington was at the head of the Tory Ministry in 1830; and\r\nthough he declared in face of an Opposition that was headed by the Whig\r\naristocrats, and included the middle-class manufacturers and the great bulk\r\nof the working class in the industrial districts of Lancashire, Yorkshire\r\nand the Midlands, that \"no better system (of Parliamentary representation)\r\ncould be devised by the wit of man\" than the unreformed House of Commons,\r\nand that he would never bring forward a reform measure himself, and should\r\nalways feel it his duty to resist such measure when proposed by others,\r\nyet, in less than two years after this speech Wellington's resistance had\r\nended, and the Reform Bill was carried into law.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in those two years was this: At the general election in the\r\nsummer of 1831, the popular cry was \"the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing\r\nbut the Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole countless multitude of reformers had laid hold of the principle\r\nthat the most secure and the shortest way of obtaining what they wanted was\r\nto obtain representation. The non-electors felt themselves called upon to\r\nput forth such power as they had as a means to obtaining the power which\r\nthey claimed.\" And the non-electors were enormously successful. For they\r\n\"combined their will, their knowledge, and their manifest force in\r\npolitical unions, whence they sent forth will, knowledge, and influence\r\nover wide districts of the land. And the electors, seeing the importance of\r\nthe crisis--the unspeakable importance that it should be well\r\nconducted--joined these unions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reformers carried the day at the elections, and the new House of\r\nCommons passed the second reading of the Bill on July 8th, by 136: 367-231.\r\nOn September 21st the third reading passed by 345 to 236. Then on the 8th\r\nof October the House of Lords threw out the Bill by 199 to 158, and at once\r\nfierce riots broke out all over the country, in especial at Derby,\r\nNottingham, and Bristol.\r\n\r\nAt Derby the jail was stormed. At Nottingham the castle was burned, and of\r\nnine men subsequently convicted of riot, three were hanged. At Bristol, the\r\njail, the Mansion House, the Customs House, the Excise Office, and the\r\nBishop's Palace were burned, and twelve lives were lost in three days.\r\n\r\nThe new session opened in December, and again the Bill was introduced, and\r\nthis time the second reading had a majority of 162: 324-162. The House of\r\nLords hesitated when the Bill came up to them at the end of March, 1832;\r\nallowed the second reading to pass by 184 to 175, and then in Committee\r\nstruck out those clauses which disfranchised the \"rotten\"\r\nboroughs--uninhabited constituencies like Old Sarum. Grey, the Whig Prime\r\nMinister, at once resigned, and the Duke of Wellington endeavoured to form\r\na Tory anti-reform Ministry. But the task was beyond him, the temper of the\r\ncountry was impatient of any further postponement of the Bill. Petitions\r\npoured in urging Parliament to vote no supplies, and resolutions were\r\npassed refusing to pay taxes till the Bill became law.\r\n\r\nOn Wellington's failure to make a Government, William IV. had to recall\r\nGrey, and the Whigs resumed office with an assurance that, if necessary,\r\nthe King would create sufficient peers favourable to reform, so that the\r\nBill should pass.\r\n\r\nThe battle was over, the anti-Reformers retired, and on June 4th, 1832, the\r\nReform Bill passed the Lords by 106 to 22, receiving the Royal Assent three\r\ndays later.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs protested that the Reform Bill was _a final measure_, and Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett, the veteran reformer, was content to vote with the Tories\r\nwhen the Act had become law. But there is no finality in politics, and the\r\nReform Bill was only the removal of a barrier on the road to democracy. The\r\nTories described the Bill as revolutionary, but as a matter of fact the Act\r\nof 1832 neither fulfilled the hopes of its friends nor the fears of its\r\nfoes. What the Act did was to transfer the balance of power from the landed\r\naristocracy, which had been in the main predominant since 1688, to the\r\nricher members of the middle class--the big farmers in the country, the\r\nprosperous shopkeepers in the towns. The working class was still voteless,\r\nand the old democratic franchise of Preston and Westminster was gone from\r\nthose boroughs.\r\n\r\nThe first reformed Parliament met early in 1833, and the change in the\r\ncharacter of the House of Commons was seen at once. Government accepted\r\nresponsibility for legislation in a way that had never been known before.\r\nThe New Poor Law, 1834, and the new Municipal Corporations Act, 1835, were\r\nthe beginning of our present system of local government. Slavery was\r\nabolished in all British Colonies in 1833.\r\n\r\nGreville, in his Memoirs, gives us an impression of the new regime in\r\nParliament as it appeared to one who belonged to the old dethroned\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing that strikes one is its inferiority to preceding Houses of\r\nCommons, and the presumption, impertinence, and self-sufficiency of the new\r\nmembers.... There exists no _party_ but that of the Government; the Irish\r\nact in a body under O'Connell to the number of about forty; the Radicals\r\nare scattered up and down without a leader, numerous, restless, turbulent,\r\nbold, and active; the Tories, without a head, frightened, angry, and\r\nsulky.\"\r\n\r\nTHE WORKING CLASS STILL UNREPRESENTED\r\n\r\nBut the working classes were the really disappointed people in the country.\r\nThey had worked for the reformers, and their energies--and their\r\nviolence--had been the driving force that had carried the Bill into law. If\r\ntheir expectations were extravagant and their hopes over-heated, the more\r\nbitter was their distress at the failure of the Reform Act to accomplish\r\nthe social improvements that had been predicted.\r\n\r\nCHARTISM\r\n\r\nSo the working class in despair of help from the Government, decided to get\r\nthe franchise for themselves, and for twelve years, 1838-1850, Chartism was\r\nthe great popular movement. The _Five Points of the People's Charter_ were\r\nproclaimed in 1838: (1) Universal Suffrage; (2) Vote by Ballot; (3) Annual\r\nParliaments; (4) Abolition of Property Qualification for Members of\r\nParliament; (5) Payment of Members. A Sixth Point--Equal Electoral\r\nDistricts--was left out in the National Petition.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Chartist demands were political, it was the social misery of\r\nthe time that drove men and women into the Chartist movement. The\r\nwretchedness of their lot--its hopeless outlook, and the horrible housing\r\nconditions in the big towns--these things seemed intolerable to the more\r\nintelligent of the working people, and thousands flocked to the monster\r\nChartist demonstrations, and found comfort in the orations of Feargus\r\nO'Connor, Bronterre O'Brien, and Ernest Jones.\r\n\r\nThe Charter promised political enfranchisement to the labouring people, and\r\nonce enfranchised they could work out by legislation their own social\r\nsalvation. So it seemed in the 'Forties--when one in every eleven of the\r\nindustrial population was a pauper.\r\n\r\nStephens, a \"hot-headed\" Chartist preacher, put the case as he, a typical\r\nagitator of the day, saw it in 1839: \"The principle of the People's Charter\r\nis the right of every man to have his home, his hearth, and his happiness.\r\nThe question of universal suffrage is, after all, a knife-and-fork\r\nquestion. It means that every workman has a right to have a good hat and\r\ncoat, a good roof, a good dinner, no more work than will keep him in\r\nhealth, and as much wages as will keep him in plenty.\"[79]\r\n\r\nThe lot of the labourer and the artisan was found to be worse than it was\r\nin the earlier years of the nineteenth century, before the great Reform Act\r\nhad been passed.[80] And while the Anti-Corn Law League, the Socialist\r\npropaganda of Robert Owen, and the agitation for factory legislation, all\r\npromised help and attracted large numbers of workmen, the Chartist movement\r\nwas by far the strongest and most revolutionary of all the post-reform\r\npopular agitations. Chartism went to pieces because the leaders could not\r\nwork together, and were, in fact, greatly divided as to the methods and\r\nobjects of the movement. By 1848 Bronterre O'Brien had retired from the\r\nChartist ranks, Feargus O'Connor was M.P. for Nottingham--to be led away\r\nfrom the House of Commons hopelessly insane, to die in 1855--and Ernest\r\nJones could only say when the Chartist Convention broke up in hopeless\r\ndisagreement, \"amid the desertion of friends, and the invasion of enemies,\r\nthe fusee has been trampled out, and elements of our energy are scattered\r\nto the winds of heaven.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of its failure, Chartism kept alive for many years the desire for\r\npolitical enfranchisement in the labouring classes. That desire never died\r\nout. Although Palmerston, the \"Tory chief of a Radical Cabinet\"--so\r\nDisraeli accurately enough described him--was Prime Minister from 1855 to\r\n1865 (with one short interval), and during that period gave no\r\nencouragement to political reform, the opinion in the country grew steadily\r\nin favour of working-class enfranchisement. Palmerston's very inactivity\r\ndrove Liberals and the younger Conservatives to look to the working classes\r\nfor support for the measures that were planned. The middle class was\r\nsatisfied that the artisans could be admitted to the franchise without\r\ndanger to the Constitution. Palmerston's death in 1865 left the Liberal\r\nParty to Earl Russell's premiership, with Gladstone as its leader in the\r\nCommons. Reform was now inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe Bill as first introduced in 1866 was a moderate measure, making a £7\r\nrental the qualification for a vote in the boroughs. It was too moderate to\r\nprovoke any enthusiasm, and it was hateful to the old Palmerstonian Whigs\r\nand most of the Conservatives, who objected to any enfranchisement of the\r\nworking class. By a combination of these opponents the Bill was defeated,\r\nthe Liberals retired from office, and a Conservative ministry under Lord\r\nDerby, with Disraeli leading the House of Commons, was formed.\r\n\r\nTHE HYDE PARK RAILINGS (1866)\r\n\r\nIt was seen quickly that there was a very real demand for the\r\nenfranchisement of the town workman--the agricultural districts remained\r\nunawakened--and Reform Leagues and Reform Unions sprang up as they had done\r\nin 1831. Then in London came the incident of the Hyde Park railings, which\r\ngave a distinct impetus to the Reform movement. What happened at Hyde Park\r\nwas this: the London Reform Union decided to hold a monster demonstration\r\nin Hyde Park on July 23rd, but the Chief Commissioner of Police had\r\ndeclared the meeting must not take place, and ordered the gates to be\r\nclosed at five o'clock. Mr. Edmund Beales, and other leaders of the London\r\nReform Union, on being refused admittance, drove away calmly to hold a\r\nmeeting in Trafalgar Square, but the great mass of people remained outside\r\nthe park, \"pressed and pressing round the railings.\" Some were clinging to\r\nthe railings; others deliberately weakened the supports of the railings.\r\nPark Lane was thronged, and all along the Bayswater Road there was a dense\r\ncrowd. The line was too long for the police to defend, and presently, when\r\nthe railings yielded to the pressure, the people poured in to the park.\r\n\r\n\"There was a simultaneous, impulsive rush, and some yards of railing were\r\ndown, and men in scores were tumbling and floundering and rushing over\r\nthem. The example was followed along Park Lane, and in a moment half a mile\r\nof iron railings was lying on the grass, and a tumultuous and delighted mob\r\nwas swarming over the park. The news ran wildly through the town. Some\r\nthought it a revolt; others were of opinion it was a revolution. The first\r\nday of liberty was proclaimed here--the breaking loose of anarchy was\r\nshrieked at there. The mob capered and jumped over the sward for half the\r\nnight through. Flower beds and shrubs suffered a good deal, not so much\r\nfrom wanton destruction, as from the pure boisterousness which came of an\r\nunexpected opportunity for horseplay. There were a good many little\r\nencounters with the police; stones were thrown on the one side, and\r\ntruncheons used on the other pretty freely. A few heads were broken on both\r\nsides, and a few prisoners were made by the police; but there was no\r\nrevolution, no revolt, no serious riot even.\"[81]\r\n\r\nThe Guards were called out, and a detachment arrived at the park, but the\r\npeople only cheered the soldiers good-humouredly. Not even a blank\r\ncartridge was fired that day.\r\n\r\nThe Government, however, took the Hyde Park disturbance with extreme\r\nseriousness. \"Nothing can well be more certain than the fact that the Hyde\r\nPark riot, as it was called, convinced Her Majesty's ministers of the\r\nnecessity of an immediate adoption of the reform principle.\"[82] Disraeli,\r\nwho in 1859 had proposed reform without getting any support, now saw that a\r\ngreat opportunity had come for a constructive Conservative policy, and\r\nboldly insisted to his party that Parliamentary Reform was a necessity.\r\n\"You cannot establish a party of mere resistance to change, for change is\r\ninevitable in a progressive country,\" he told his followers.\r\n\r\nAll through the autumn and winter great demonstrations took place in the\r\nlarge towns and cities of the country in support of the demand for the\r\nenfranchisement of the workman, and when Parliament met in February, 1867,\r\na Reform Bill was promised in the Queen's Speech. To Lord Derby the measure\r\nwas frankly a \"leap in the dark,\" and one or two Conservative ministers\r\n(including Cranborne, afterwards Lord Salisbury) left the Government in\r\ndisgust. But the Conservatives generally chuckled at \"dishing the Whigs,\"\r\nand the Bill, with considerable revision, was passed through both Houses of\r\nParliament by August.\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\nBy the Reform Bill of 1867 all male householders in boroughs were\r\nenfranchised, and all male lodgers who paid £10 a year for unfurnished\r\nrooms. The town workman was enfranchised by this Act as the middle-class\r\nman had been enfranchised by the Act of 1832, and the electorate was\r\nincreased from about 100,000 to 2,000,000. An amendment that women should\r\nnot be excluded from the franchise was moved by John Stuart Mill, and\r\ndefeated. Some redistribution of seats took place under the Act of 1867,\r\neleven boroughs were disfranchised, thirty-five with less than 10,000\r\ninhabitants were made single-member constituencies, and additional\r\nrepresentation was given to Chelsea, Hackney, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester,\r\nSalford, Glasgow, Birmingham, Dundee, and Merthyr. \"Thus was _Household\r\nSuffrage_ brought in in the boroughs, and a great step was made towards\r\ndemocracy, for it was plain that the middle-class county constituencies\r\ncould not last very much longer now that all workmen who happened to live\r\nin boroughs had their votes.\"[83]\r\n\r\nThe third Reform Act, giving household suffrage to the country districts,\r\nwas passed by Gladstone in 1884, and it was followed by a Redistribution of\r\nSeats Act in 1885. By these two Acts the agricultural labourer was\r\nenfranchised, a service franchise was created for those who were qualified\r\nneither as householders nor lodgers, and the principle of single-member\r\nequal electoral districts--on a basis of 54,000 inhabitants--was adopted.\r\nOnly twenty-three boroughs, the City of London and the Universities of\r\nOxford, Cambridge, and Dublin, retained double-member representation. The\r\nmembership of the House of Commons was increased from six hundred and\r\nfifty-eight to six hundred and seventy, the present total; and the\r\nfranchise remains as it was fixed in 1885--occupation and ownership giving\r\nthe right to vote.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, for more than a hundred years, a plea has been put\r\nforward for universal or adult suffrage for men on the ground of an\r\nabstract right to vote, but it has met with little encouragement.[84] There\r\nis, however, a wide feeling in favour of simplifying the registration laws,\r\nso that a three-months' residence, instead of, as at present, a year's\r\nresidence from one July to the next, should be sufficient to qualify for\r\nthe franchise. There is also a strong demand for \"one man, one vote.\" At\r\npresent, while no elector may give more than one vote in any constituency,\r\nhe may, if he has property in various places, give a vote in each of these\r\ndistricts, and some men thus give as many as a dozen votes at a general\r\nelection. This plural voting by property and residential qualifications in\r\ndifferent constituencies is not customary in other constitutional\r\ncountries, and a Bill for its abolition passed the House of Commons in\r\n1906, but was rejected by the Lords.\r\n\r\nWhile Liberals urge \"one man, one vote\" as the more democratic arrangement,\r\nConservatives reply by asking for \"one vote, one value\"--that is, a new\r\nredistribution of seats, for in the last twenty-five years there have been\r\ndeep and extensive changes in the distribution of populations, and Ireland\r\nin particular is over-represented, it is maintained. But then the\r\nrepresentation of Ireland in the House of Commons was really guaranteed by\r\nthe Act of Union, 1800.[85]\r\n\r\nWORKING-CLASS REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nWith the extension of the franchise the change in the _personnel_ of the\r\nHouse of Commons has become marked. The more wealthy of the middle class\r\nentered in considerable numbers after 1832; the Acts of 1867 and 1884 made\r\nthe entry of the workman inevitable. The miners were the first to send\r\nLabour representatives to Parliament, and to-day their members outnumber\r\nthose of any other trade. Since 1892 industrial constituencies, chiefly in\r\nYorkshire, Lancashire, South Wales, and the mining districts, have gone on\r\nsteadily electing and re-electing working-class representatives--trade\r\nunion secretaries and officers for the most part--and with the formation of\r\na National Labour Representation Committee in 1900, these representatives\r\nbecame a separate and distinct party--the Labour Party after 1906--in the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nEnfranchisement to secure representation for the redress of grievances has\r\nbeen the principle that has guided the English people towards democracy.\r\nBoth the middle class and the working class were convinced that\r\nenfranchisement was necessary if the House of Commons was to be in any real\r\nsense a representative assembly, and both have used enfranchisement for\r\nobtaining representation in Parliament. The return of forty Labour Members\r\nat recent general elections is evidence that a large electorate supports\r\nthe Labour Party in its desire to carry in Parliament legislation that will\r\nmake life a better thing for the labourer and his family; and in the House\r\nof Commons the Labour Members have won a general respect. As a matter of\r\nfact, the House of Commons to-day is in every way a more orderly, a more\r\nintelligent, more business-like, and better-mannered assembly than it was\r\nin the days before 1832.\r\n\r\nNo stronger evidence of the value of Parliamentary representation to the\r\nworking-class can be offered than the large output of what may be called\r\nlabour legislation in recent years. It is true that Lord Shaftesbury's\r\nbenevolent and entirely disinterested activities promoted Factory Acts in\r\nthe first half of the nineteenth century, but in the last twenty years\r\nmeasures for the amelioration of the lot of the workman have been\r\nconstantly before Parliament.\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF RELIGIOUS DISABILITIES--CATHOLICS, JEWS, AND FREETHINKERS\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century was not only the century of popular enfranchisement;\r\nit was the century that saw the removal of religious disabilities, and the\r\nfree admission to Parliament and to the Government of Roman Catholics,\r\nNonconformists, Jews, and Freethinkers.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800 Roman Catholics in England were excluded from Parliament,\r\nfrom the franchise, from the magistracy, the Bar, the Civil Service, from\r\nmunicipal corporations, and from commissions in the Army and Navy. Pitt was\r\nwilling to abolish these disabilities on the passing of the Act of Union,\r\nand the Irish people were bitterly disappointed that the disabilities\r\nremained. But George III. refused all assent to the proposals, and Pitt\r\nresigned. Several times the House of Commons passed Catholic Relief Bills,\r\nwhich were thrown out by the Lords, and it was not till 1829, when \"the\r\nEnglish ministry had to choose between concession and civil war,\" that Peel\r\nand the Duke of Wellington yielded and persuaded their party to admit\r\nCatholics to Parliament and to the Civil and Military Services.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Penal Laws against Roman Catholics--Acts of Elizabeth\r\nthat inflicted penalties on priests who said mass in England, and on Roman\r\nCatholics who attended mass--took place in 1844, and in 1866 the\r\nParliamentary Oath was amended and made unobjectionable to Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nA Roman Catholic is still excluded by law from the Crown, the Lord\r\nChancellorship, and the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland, but many Roman\r\nCatholics are members of Parliament--members of all parties--and the late\r\nLord Ripon, a Catholic, sat in a Liberal Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Rothschild was elected as a Liberal M.P. for the City of London,\r\nbut the law did not permit him to take his seat. Then for some years Jewish\r\nM.P.'s were allowed to take part in debates and sit on committees, but were\r\nnot allowed to vote. Finally, in 1858, the Lords, after rejecting the\r\nmeasure for ten years, passed the Jews' Disabilities Bill, which removed\r\nall restriction. The Right Hon. Herbert Samuel, M.P., is the first Jew to\r\nsit in the Cabinet, for though Disraeli was of the Jewish race, he was a\r\nChristian in belief.\r\n\r\nAlthough in 1800 various Acts on the Statute Book required Nonconformists\r\nto subscribe to the religion of the Church of England before taking part in\r\nmunicipal affairs, these Acts had long been a dead letter. All that was\r\ndone in the nineteenth century was to repeal these Acts, and to throw open\r\nthe universities and public offices to Nonconformists. It is only, however,\r\nin recent years that Nonconformists have filled posts of high importance in\r\nthe Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe last attempt at restriction on the religious beliefs of members of\r\nParliament was made in the House of Commons itself, when Charles Bradlaugh,\r\nafter being duly elected M.P. for Northampton, was by the action of the\r\nHouse excluded from his seat. Bradlaugh was a frank disbeliever in\r\nChristianity, and the House of Commons refused to allow him either to take\r\nthe oath or make an affirmation. For five years (1880-5) the struggle\r\nlasted--a Liberal Government being in power all the time--and three times\r\nduring that period the electors of Northampton triumphantly returned\r\nCharles Bradlaugh as their member, only to be answered by resolutions of\r\nrefusal and expulsion passed by the House of Commons against their\r\nrepresentative. It was a repetition of the battle Wilkes had fought one\r\nhundred and twenty years earlier, and it ended in the same way. A new\r\nParliament assembled in January, 1886 (after a general election in\r\nNovember), the new Speaker (Mr. Peel) permitted Bradlaugh to take the oath\r\nin the usual way, declined to allow any interference, and the battle was\r\nover. Two years later a general Affirmation Bill was carried on the motion\r\nof Bradlaugh, and became law. When Charles Bradlaugh lay dying in January,\r\n1891, the House of Commons passed, without dissent, a resolution expunging\r\nfrom the journals of the House the old resolutions of exclusion.\r\n\r\nTHE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF WOMEN\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century then will always be noted as the era of steady\r\nadvance towards democracy, especially in England. Enfranchisement of the\r\nworkman, and his representation in Parliament, have transferred the\r\ngovernment of the country from an aristocracy to the middle class and the\r\nworking class, for to-day, alike in Parliament and in the permanent Civil\r\nService, men of the middle class predominate, assisted by those who served\r\napprenticeship in mine or workshop. The removal of religious disabilities\r\nhas ended the old rule that confined the business of the legislature and\r\nthe administration of justice to members of the Established Church of\r\nEngland, and Roman Catholics, Jews, Nonconformists, and Freethinkers now\r\ntake their share in all public work.\r\n\r\nOne disability only remains--the sex disability that denies the\r\nparliamentary franchise to women. In the middle ages women were excused\r\nfrom parliamentary attendance, but there was no notion that their powers\r\nand privileges as landowners were shortened because, on account of their\r\nsex, they were granted exemption from Parliament and from juries. In 1868 a\r\ntest case--Chorlton _v._ Lings--was brought, and the judges decided that\r\nwomen householders were not to be registered as electors, and it was left\r\nto Parliament to pass a Women's Enfranchisement Bill. From the time of John\r\nStuart Mill's advocacy in 1867 there have always been supporters of Women's\r\nSuffrage in the House of Commons, and in the last five years these\r\nsupporters have been growing in numbers. Only the refusal of the Government\r\nto give time for the discussion of the Bill in Committee has prevented a\r\nWoman's Enfranchisement measure, which on several occasions has received a\r\nsecond reading, from passing the House of Commons; and the announcement by\r\nthe present (1911) Government that full facilities for such discussion are\r\nto be granted next year (1912) would indicate that the removal of political\r\nsex disabilities is close at hand. Women are not asking for adult suffrage,\r\nbut are willing to receive enfranchisement on the terms that qualify men as\r\nelectors, and the Conciliation Bill, as it is called--because members of\r\nevery political party have agreed to make it their Bill--would place on the\r\nroll of electors rather more than a million of women voters.\r\n\r\nMeantime, while waiting for the removal of the anti-democratic barrier that\r\nexcludes them from full political citizenship, women are admitted in the\r\nUnited Kingdom to an equal share with men in all local government. Since\r\n1869 women who are householders have enjoyed the municipal franchise, and\r\nas Poor Law guardians and members of school boards, they have been freely\r\nelected to sit side by side with men. In 1907 women were declared eligible\r\nby Parliament for membership on county and borough councils, and for the\r\nchairmanship of county councils and the mayoralty of boroughs. Since this\r\nAct was passed we have seen women elected to the councils of great\r\ncities--Manchester and Liverpool, for instance--and chosen as mayors in\r\nseveral towns. No political movement in recent years has been of greater\r\npublic interest or importance than the agitation for \"Votes for Women.\" The\r\ndemand for enfranchisement is based on the old constitutional ground of the\r\nParliamentarians of the seventeenth century--that those who are directly\r\ntaxed by Government must have some political control of the public\r\nexpenditure--and it is supported by the present leader of the Conservative\r\nParty[86] on the ground that government can only be carried on in England\r\nby consent of the governed.\r\n\r\nThe demand for the parliamentary franchise is with us the expression of\r\nthat deep dissatisfaction at the unequal relations of the sexes that is\r\nfelt by many men, and by far more women, all over the civilised world. As\r\nthe middle-class man and the workmen of Great Britain were sure that they\r\ncould not get from Parliament an understanding of popular grievances, still\r\nless fair treatment, until they possessed the right to choose their own\r\nparliamentary representatives, so women are convinced that there can be no\r\nadequate adjustment of these unequal relations until they too enjoy the\r\nsame privilege of citizenship; for enfranchisement and representation are\r\nthe two chosen instruments of democratic government in our day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY AT WORK\r\n\r\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nTo-day in Great Britain, in America, in the self-governing colonies, and in\r\nmany European countries, we can sec the principles of democracy in working\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe whole system of local government in Great Britain and Ireland is\r\nessentially democratic. The municipal councils of all the large cities are\r\nelected on household suffrage, and have enormous powers. There is now no\r\nsex disability to prevent the election of women to these bodies, and,\r\nexcept in the case of the clergy of the Established Church, who are\r\ndisqualified from sitting on town councils (but not on county or district\r\ncouncils), all ratepayers are eligible for nomination. The result is that\r\non nearly every city council, and on a great number of county councils,\r\nLondon borough councils, urban and rural district councils, boards of\r\nguardians, and parish councils, there are working-class representatives,\r\nwhile women members have been elected to the great councils of Liverpool\r\nand Manchester, and sit on many boards of guardians and parish councils.\r\n\r\nAll these councils are of recent creation. The Municipal Corporations Act\r\nof 1835 placed the election of town councils for the first time in the\r\nhands of the ratepayers, but the real reform of local government dates from\r\n1888. In that year the Conservative Government established county and\r\ndistrict councils and Lord Rosebery became the first chairman of the London\r\nCounty Council. Six years later the Liberals set up parish councils in the\r\nrural districts, with parish meetings where the population did not exceed\r\nthree hundred. In 1899 the Conservatives displaced the old London vestries\r\nby borough councils, and in 1902-3 abolished in England the school boards\r\ncreated in 1870, and made the county council the local authority for public\r\nelementary education. Scotland was allowed to retain its school boards, and\r\nstrong but unsuccessful opposition was made in London and the chief cities\r\nto the suppression of the specially elected education authority.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RIGHT HON. JOHN BURNS, M.P.\r\n\r\n_Photo: Moyse, Putney._]\r\n\r\nAs far as rural England is concerned, county councils, district councils,\r\nand parish councils are, generally speaking, very reluctant to put into\r\noperation the wide powers they possess. The average county council, though\r\npopularly elected, is composed in agricultural England of landowners and\r\nthe bigger farmers, who, as a common rule, do not favour a land programme\r\nfor labourers, and are anxious to keep down the rates. The rural district\r\ncouncil and board of guardians are equally averse from any display of\r\npublic enterprise, and the parish council, which often consists mainly of\r\nlabourers, rarely accomplishes anything except at the prompting, or with\r\nthe sanction, of the parochial landowner. The result is that allotments,\r\nrural housing, village baths and washhouses, an adequate water supply,\r\npublic halls and libraries, are not regarded as the concern of rural\r\nelected authorities, but are left to the private enterprise of landowners.\r\nCivic pride, which glories in the public proprietorship of lands and\r\nlibraries, tramways and lodging-houses, waterworks and workmen's dwellings,\r\nart galleries and swimming baths, and is a living influence in the\r\nmunicipalities of, let us say, London, Glasgow, Liverpool, Leeds, Bradford,\r\nManchester, Birmingham, West Ham, and many a smaller borough, does not\r\nexist in rural councils. To the farmer and the peasant public ownership is\r\na new and alien thing. The common lands and all the old village communal\r\nlife have gone out of the memory of rural England; but the feudal tradition\r\nthat the landowner is the real centre of authority has survived, and it is\r\nthe benevolent landowner who is expected to build cottages, grant\r\nallotments, and see to the water supply, as fifty years ago he built and\r\nmanaged the village school. Political organisation could break through this\r\ntradition, but farmers and agricultural labourers are without this\r\norganisation; and so the authority of the landowner remains, in spite of\r\nthe democratic constitution of local government. The people can allow their\r\npower to remain in the hands of others, just as a king can be content to\r\nreign without ruling, and the local government of rural England is an\r\noligarchy elected by a popular franchise.\r\n\r\nIn the factory towns and the mining districts it is a very different\r\nmatter. Here the people are organised, and take their share in local\r\ngovernment. In the county of Durham, for instance, the working class\r\npredominates on local councils, and the influence of trade unions prevails\r\nin these assemblies wherever a strong Labour party exists. Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain began his public career on the Birmingham Town Council, and his\r\nmunicipal services earned for him the enthusiastic support of Birmingham\r\nfor all his later political ventures. It would be difficult to mention the\r\nname of a great statesman who laid the foundations of his fame in rural\r\nlocal government.\r\n\r\nAs in local government, so in the Imperial Parliament. Rural England sends\r\nno Labour member to the House of Commons. Only in very exceptional cases\r\nhas a tenant farmer been elected. It is the social labour of the mine and\r\nthe mill that has produced the Labour member of Parliament.\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Arch made a valiant attempt to organise the agricultural\r\nlabourers of England, and from 1880 to 1890 a rural labourers' union, with\r\nsome thousands of members, was in existence. For a time this secured a rise\r\nin wages, and when Mr. Arch was in Parliament, as a Liberal M.P.\r\n(1885-1895), the rural labourer hoped for lasting improvement in the\r\nconditions of life. But the Union fell to pieces, and Mr. Arch was not\r\nstrong enough single-handed to force the claims of his constituents on the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nTHE WORKMAN IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\nTo-day there are more than forty workmen in the House of Commons, and the\r\ngreat majority of these have served an apprenticeship in municipal and\r\ntrade union offices. Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire, Lancashire,\r\nStafford, South Wales, Glasgow, Dundee, Leicester, Norwich and London, all\r\nhave their elected Labour members in Parliament, and a marked preference is\r\nshown for the man who has proved his honesty and capacity in the\r\nmunicipality, or as the leader of his trade union. All the miners'\r\nrepresentatives are tried and experienced men. Mr. G.N. Barnes, M.P., was\r\nfor ten years the general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of\r\nEngineers. Mr. Clynes, M.P., was elected to the office of district\r\nsecretary of the Gas Workers' and General Labourers' Union twenty years\r\nago; Mr. Will Thorne, M.P., has been general secretary of the same union\r\nsince 1889, and has sat on the West Ham Corporation for more than sixteen\r\nyears. Mr. George Lansbury, M.P., and Mr. Will Crooks, M.P., are well known\r\nfor their work on the London County Council and on their local borough\r\ncouncil and board of guardians. Similarly with other Labour members of\r\nParliament. Their lives are marked by a sense of public responsibility,\r\nwith the result that in the House of Commons they are grave, business-like,\r\nand undemonstrative. The Labour members do not make \"scenes\"; they respect\r\nthe rules of the House and the dignity of the National Assembly, partly\r\nbecause they are all in sober middle age, but more because they have learnt\r\nthat public business can only be carried on by due observance of order; and\r\nthey are in Parliament to get business done for their constituents, to\r\npromote legislation that will make life easier for the working class. When\r\nMr. Victor Grayson, in the exuberance of youth, and with a passion that\r\nblazed out against the misery of the poor, made a \"scene\" in the House of\r\nCommons, and was expelled, the Labour members were quite sincere in their\r\ndisapproval. They understood, with a wider knowledge than Mr. Grayson\r\npossessed, that \"scenes\" alienated sympathy in the House, were not helpful\r\nin debate, and were not popular with the electors.\r\n\r\nThe member who would succeed in the House of Commons must respect the\r\nusages of the House, and show himself loyal to its laws of debate. As long\r\nas this respect and loyalty are shown the Labour member is accepted by his\r\nfellow-members as one who has been elected to the greatest club in the\r\nworld, and is justly entitled to all the privileges of membership. For the\r\nBritish House of Commons is a democratic assembly, and in its collective\r\npride it cares nothing for the opinions or social rank of its members. All\r\nit asks is that the newly-elected member should be alive to the honour of\r\nmembership, should be modest in his bearing, and should as soon as possible\r\n\"catch the tone of the House.\" He may be a labourer, or the son of a belted\r\nearl; the House is indifferent so long as his parliamentary manners are\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons is a far more orderly assembly than it was a hundred\r\nyears ago; it is more sober and less noisy, and the arrival of Labour\r\nmembers has increased rather than diminished its good behaviour. It is also\r\na far more industrious assembly, and the influence of the Labour party\r\ncompels an amount of legislation that honourable members would have thought\r\nimpossible fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nWORKING-CLASS LEADERS IN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nThree representative working-class leaders in the House of Commons stand\r\nout pre-eminently in contemporary politics--the Right Hon. John Burns, Mr.\r\nJ. Keir Hardie, and Mr. J. Ramsay MacDonald. The Right Hon. D. Lloyd George\r\nis conspicuous rather as the representative of the industrious\r\nNonconformist middle class, but the success of his career is no less\r\nsignificant of the advance of democracy. The very Cabinet is now no longer\r\nan aristocratic committee, and the highest offices of executive government\r\nare held by men who are neither wealthy nor of distinguished family.\r\n\r\nTwo working-class leaders of an earlier generation--the Right Hon. T. Burt,\r\nM.P., and Mr. H. Broadhurst--held office as Under-Secretaries in the\r\nLiberal Government of 1892-5; but Mr. John Burns is the first trade\r\nunionist to sit in the Cabinet. He, too, might have been an Under-Secretary\r\nin the days of that short-lived Ministry, but decided, with characteristic\r\nvigour, that if he was fit to be an Under-Secretary he was fit for the\r\nCabinet. At the close of 1905 the opportunity came, and the offer of Sir H.\r\nCampbell-Bannerman to preside over the Local Government Board was promptly\r\naccepted. The workman first took his place in the Cabinet when Mr. John\r\nBurns, at the age of forty-seven, went to the Local Government Board--to\r\nthe complete satisfaction of Mr. Burns. For the robust egoism of Mr. Burns\r\nis largely a class pride. His invincible belief in himself is part of an\r\nequally invincible belief in the working class. His ambitions thrive on the\r\nconviction that whatever Mr. John Burns does, that the working class does\r\nin the person of their representative. Always does he identify himself with\r\nthe mechanics and labourers with whom his earlier years were spent, and by\r\nwhose support he has risen to office. The more honours for Mr. John Burns,\r\nthe more does it seem to this stalwart optimist that the working class is\r\nhonoured. He arrays himself in court dress at the palaces of kings,\r\nreceives honorary degrees at Universities, and is kept before the public by\r\nthe newspaper paragraphist, without wincing or pretending to dislike it.\r\nWhy should the workman not be esteemed by kings and universities? Mr. Burns\r\nasks. So great is his self-respect that the respect of others is taken as a\r\nmatter of course. Much of the criticism that has been directed against Mr.\r\nJohn Burns misses the mark, because it does not recognise that the motive\r\npower at work all the time in his career is the triumph of his class. It is\r\nthe triumph of a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, of a\r\nLondon workman, that Mr. John Burns beholds with unconcealed pleasure in\r\nhis own success.\r\n\r\nThere are drawbacks, of course, to this complete self-satisfaction. Since\r\nthe workman has triumphed in the person of Mr. John Burns, the working\r\nclass would do well to follow his example, and heed his advice on all\r\nmatters affecting its welfare, Mr. Burns argues. The failures of\r\nworking-class life and the misery of the poor are due to the lack of those\r\nvirtues that he possesses, he is apt to maintain. Hence Mr. Burns is hated\r\nas a Pharisee in certain quarters when he extols self-reliance and total\r\nabstinence as essential to working-class prosperity, and points to gambling\r\nand strong drink as the root of all evil in the State. It is sometimes\r\nurged that Mr. Burns over-praises his own merits; but the fault is really\r\nin the opposite direction; he does not appreciate sufficiently that the\r\ngifts he possesses--the gifts he has used so fully and so freely--are\r\nexceptional. These gifts are a powerful physique, a great voice, a\r\ntremendous energy, and a love of literature; and they are not the common\r\nequipment of the skilled mechanic and the labourer. True, they are often\r\nwasted and destroyed when they do exist; and in the case of Mr. Burns a\r\nstrongly disciplined will has made them abundantly fruitful. But from the\r\nfirst the physique, the voice, and the untiring energy were far above those\r\nthat fall to the lot of the average workman; and the love of books stored\r\nthe mind with rich supplies of language to be drawn upon when speeches were\r\nto be made. Not as an administrator at the Local Government Board has Mr.\r\nBurns become famous. His fame as a champion of the working class was\r\nestablished by popular ovations in Hyde Park and at dock gates. Battersea\r\nhas been won and held by the speeches of its member. It is not the mighty\r\nvoice alone, silencing interruption often enough by sheer volume of sound,\r\nbut the plainly pointed epigram, the ready jest and the quick repartee that\r\nendear Mr. John Burns' speeches to the multitude. His sayings and phrases\r\nare quoted. His wit is the wit of the Londoner--the wit that Dickens knew\r\nand studied, the wit of the older cabmen and 'bus drivers, the wit of the\r\nstreet boy. It is racy, it is understood, and the illustrations are always\r\nconcrete and massive, never vague or unsubstantial. Apt Shakespearian\r\nquotations, familiar and unfamiliar, embellish the speeches. Personality,\r\nvital personality, counts for so much in the orator of the market place.\r\nThe speaker must be alive to his audience, he must convince by his presence\r\nno less than by his arguments. And Mr. Burns is so obviously alive. He\r\nwarms the shrunken, anæmic vitality of followers, and overpowers the\r\nprotests of enemies by sheer force of character.\r\n\r\nMr. John Burns is at his real vocation when addressing a great multitude.\r\nHis energy finds an outlet in speech on those occasions, an outlet it can\r\nnever find in the necessary routine of office administration. He was made\r\nfor a life of action, and when once, in youth, he had thrown himself into\r\nthe active study of political and industrial questions, every opportunity\r\nwas seized for stating the results of that study. As a Social Democratic\r\ncandidate for Parliament, Mr. Burns polled 598 votes at West Nottingham in\r\n1885. In 1886 he was charged (with Messrs. Hyndman, Champion, and Williams)\r\nwith seditious conspiracy--after an unemployed riot in the West End--and\r\nacquitted. In 1887 he suffered six weeks imprisonment (with Mr. R.B.\r\nCunninghame Graham) for contesting the right of free speech in Trafalgar\r\nSquare. In 1889 came the great London dock strike, and, with Messrs. Mann\r\nand Tillett, Mr. Burns was a chief leader of the dockers. Battersea\r\nreturned him to the London County Council in 1889 and to the House of\r\nCommons in 1892. The Liberal Party promised a wider sphere of work than the\r\nSocialists could offer; political isolation was a barren business; and Mr.\r\nBurns gradually passed from the councils of the trade union movement to the\r\nTreasury Bench of a Liberal Ministry. But the Socialist convictions of\r\nearly manhood had a lasting influence on their owner. These convictions\r\nhave been mellowed by work; responsibility has checked and placed under\r\nsubjection the old revolutionary ardour; experience finds the road to a\r\nco-operative commonwealth by no means a quick or easy route, and admits the\r\nnecessity of compromise. But there is still a consciousness of the working\r\nclass as a class in the speeches of Mr. Burns; and there is still the\r\nbelief expressed that the working class must work out their own salvation,\r\nand that it is better the people should have the power to manage their own\r\nnational and municipal affairs, and the wisdom to use that power aright,\r\nrather than that a benevolent bureaucracy should manage things for them.\r\nMr. John Burns is an older man by twenty-five years than he was in the\r\nstormy days of the Trafalgar Square riots, and he is now a Privy Councillor\r\nand Cabinet Minister, but his character is little changed. His speeches on\r\nthe settlement of the great Dock Strike of August, 1911, are the speeches\r\nof the man of 1889. Parliamentary life made sharper changes in the minds of\r\nGladstone and Mr. Joseph Chamberlain than it has made in the mind of the\r\nRight Hon. John Burns. But Mr. Burns never admits that he possesses health\r\nand vigour beyond the average.\r\n\r\nA working class leader of vastly different qualities is Mr. J. Keir Hardie,\r\nM.P. He, too, no less significant of democracy, stands as the\r\nrepresentative of his class, claims always to be identified with it, to be\r\naccepted as its spokesman. A Lanarkshire miner and active trade unionist,\r\nMr. Hardie has striven to create a working-class party in politics\r\nindependent of Liberals and Conservatives; to him, more than to any other\r\nman, the existence of the Independent Labour Party and the Parliamentary\r\nLabour Party--the latter consisting of the Independent Labour Party and the\r\ntrade unions--may justly be said to be due. The political independence of\r\nan organised working class has been the one great idea of Mr. Hardie's\r\npublic life. Not by any means his only idea, for Mr. Hardie has been the\r\never-ready supporter of all democratic causes and the faithful advocate of\r\nsocial reforms; but the _great_ idea, the political pearl of great price,\r\nfor which, if necessary, all else must be sacrificed. Only by this\r\nindependence can democracy be achieved, and a more equal state of society\r\nbe accomplished--so Mr. Hardie has preached to the working people for the\r\nlast twenty-five years at public meetings and trade union congresses,\r\ntravelling the length and breadth of Great Britain in his mission.\r\n\r\nThere is something of the poet in Mr. Keir Hardie but much more of the\r\nprophet, and withal a good deal of shrewd political common sense. Where Mr.\r\nJohn Burns wants, humanly, the approval and goodwill of his friends and\r\nneighbours for his work, Mr. Keir Hardie is content with the assurance of\r\nhis own conscience; and in times of difficulty he chooses rather to walk\r\nalone, communing with his own heart, than to seek the consolations of\r\nsocial intercourse.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns is a citizen of London, a lover of its streets, at home in all\r\nits noise, a reveller in its festivities. Mr. Hardie belongs to his native\r\nland; he is happier on the hills of Lanarkshire than in the Parliament of\r\nWestminster; solitude has no terrors for him. Both men entered the House in\r\n1892. Personal integrity, blameless private life, and a doggedness that\r\nwill not acknowledge defeat, have had much to do with the success that both\r\nhave won. For if Mr. Hardie remains a private member of the House of\r\nCommons while Mr. Burns is a Cabinet Minister, Mr. Hardie has lived to see\r\nan independent Labour Party of forty members in Parliament, and has himself\r\nbeen its accredited leader.\r\n\r\nAgain, exceptional gifts may be noted. An eloquence of speech, a rugged\r\nsincerity that carries conviction, a love of nature and of literature--all\r\nthese things, controlled and tempered by will and refined by use, have won\r\nfor Mr. Hardie a high regard and an affection for the cause he champions.\r\nFor years Mr. Hardie was misrepresented in the Press, abused by political\r\nopponents and misunderstood by many of the working class. From 1895 to 1900\r\nhe was out of Parliament, rejected by the working-class electorate of South\r\nWest Ham. But nothing turned Mr. Hardie from his policy of independence, or\r\nshook his faith in the belief that only by forming a political party of\r\ntheir own could the working people establish a social democracy. Merthyr\r\nTydvil re-elected him to the House of Commons in 1900 at the very time when\r\nhe was braving a strong public opinion by denouncing the South African War;\r\nand for Merthyr Mr. Hardie will sit as long as he is in Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt may safely be said that Mr. Hardie will never take office in a Liberal\r\nMinistry. The sturdy republicanism that keeps him from court functions and\r\nfrom the dinner parties of the rich and the great, and the strong\r\nconviction that Labour members do well to retain simple habits of life, are\r\nnot qualities that impel men to join Governments.\r\n\r\nVisionary as he is--and no less a visionary because he has seen some\r\nfulfilment of his hopes--so indifferent to public opinion that many have\r\nexclaimed at his indiscretions, with a religious temperament that makes him\r\ntreat his political work as a solemn calling of God and gives prophetic\r\nfire to his public utterances, Mr. Keir Hardie may remain a private member\r\nof Parliament; but he also remains an outstanding figure in democratic\r\npolitics, conspicuous in an age that has seen the working class rising\r\ncautiously to power. Mr. Hardie's influence with the politically minded of\r\nthe working class has contributed in no small degree to the changes that\r\nare now at work. The ideal of a working class, educated and organised,\r\ntaking up the reins of government and using its power in sober\r\nrighteousness, has been preached by Mr. Hardie with a fervour that commands\r\nrespect. He has made an appeal that has moved the hearts of men and women\r\nby its religious note, and hence it is very considerably from the ranks of\r\nNonconformists with Puritan traditions that the Independent Labour Party\r\nhas been recruited. Mr. Hardie is now fifty-five years of age. He has never\r\nbeen afraid of making mistakes, and he has never sought the applause of\r\nmen. He has succeeded in arousing large numbers of people from a passive\r\nallegiance to the party governments of Liberals and Conservatives, and\r\nconstrained them to march under a Labour banner at political contests.\r\nWhether the Labour Party in Parliament will remain a separate organisation\r\nor will steadily become merged in the Liberal Party, forming perhaps a\r\ndefinite left wing of that party: whether a sufficiently large number of\r\nvoters will ever be found to make the Labour Party anything more than a\r\ngroup in Parliament: and whether the Independent Labour movement is not\r\npassing as Robert Owen's socialist movement and as the Chartist movement\r\npassed away in the middle of the nineteenth century, are questions that are\r\nyet to be answered. Democracy will go its own way in spite of the prophets.\r\nIn any case, the work of Mr. Keir Hardie has been fruitful and valuable.\r\nFor it has made for a quickened intelligence, and a more exalted view of\r\nhuman life amongst the working people; and it has increased the sense of\r\npersonal and civic responsibility. It has made for civilisation, in fact,\r\nand it has insisted on the importance of things that democracy can only\r\nforget to its own destruction.\r\n\r\nThe third distinguished working-class leader in Parliament is Mr. J. Ramsay\r\nMacDonald, the elected leader of the Labour Party, and its secretary since\r\nits formation. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald is for the working class, but, though\r\nborn of labouring people, and educated in a Scotch board school, has long\r\nceased to be of them. Never a workman, and never associated with the\r\nworkman's trade union, Mr. MacDonald went from school teaching to\r\njournalism and to a political private secretaryship, and so settled down\r\nquickly into the habits and customs of the ruling middle class. Marriage\r\nunited him still more closely with the middle class, and strengthened his\r\nposition by removing all fear of poverty, and providing opportunities for\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nFrom the first Mr. MacDonald's political life has been directed clearly to\r\none end--the assumption of power to be used for the social improvement of\r\nthe people. And this ambition has carried him far, and may carry him\r\nfarther. With the industry and persistence that are common to his race, Mr.\r\nMacDonald has taken every means available to educate himself on all\r\npolitical questions; with the result that he is accepted to-day as one of\r\nthe best informed members of the House of Commons. He taught himself to\r\nspeak, and his speeches are appreciated. He taught himself to write, and\r\nhis articles on political questions have long been welcome in the monthly\r\nreviews, and his books on Socialism are widely read. Twenty years ago the\r\nLiberal Party promised no political career to earnest men like Mr.\r\nMacDonald, men anxious for social reform. The future seemed to be with the\r\nSocialists, and with the Independent Labour Party. When the Liberal\r\ndownfall came in 1895, it was thought that the fortunes of Liberalism were\r\nended. Native prudence has restrained Mr. Ramsay MacDonald from pioneering,\r\nbut once the Independent Labour Party, of Mr. Keir Hardie's desire, was set\r\ngoing, and promised an effectual means for political work, Mr. MacDonald\r\njoined it, and did well to do so. As an ordinary Liberal or Radical Member\r\nof Parliament, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald would never have had the opportunities\r\nthe Labour Party has given him. He only entered the House of Commons in\r\n1906--at the age of forty--and already as leader of the Labour Party he is\r\na distinguished Parliamentary figure, of whose future great things are\r\nforetold.\r\n\r\nMr. MacDonald has studied politics as other people study art or science. He\r\nhas trained himself to become a statesman as men and women train themselves\r\nto become painters and musicians. He has learnt the rules of the game,\r\nmarked the way of failure and the road to success, and his career may be\r\npondered as an example to the young. No generous outburst of wrath\r\ndisfigures Mr. MacDonald's speeches, no rash utterance is ever to be\r\napologised for, no hasty impulse to be regretted. In the Labour movement\r\nMr. MacDonald won success over older men by an indefatigable industry, a\r\nmarked aptitude for politics, and by an obvious prosperity. Other things\r\nbeing equal, it is inevitable that in politics, as in commerce, the needy,\r\nimpecunious man will be rejected in favour of the man with an assured\r\nbalance at the bank, and the man of regular habits preferred before a\r\ngifted but uncertain genius. The Socialist and Labour movements of our time\r\nhave claimed the services of many gifted men and women, and the annals of\r\nthese movements are full of heroic self-sacrifice. But an aptitude for\r\npolitics was not a distinguishing mark of Socialists, and therefore Mr.\r\nMacDonald's experience and abilities gave him at once a prominent place in\r\nthe council of the Independent Labour Party, and soon made him the\r\ncontrolling power in that organisation. With the formation of the National\r\nLabour Party a very much wider realm was to be conquered, and Mr. MacDonald\r\nhas been as successful here as in the earlier Independent Labour Party. But\r\nnow the Labour Party having made Mr. MacDonald its chairman, it can do no\r\nmore for him. He is but forty-five years old, his health is good, his\r\ntalents are recognised; by his aversion from everything eccentric or\r\nexplosive, the public have understood that he is trustworthy. We may expect\r\nto see Mr. Ramsay MacDonald a Cabinet Minister in a Liberal-Labour\r\nGovernment. It may even happen that he will become Prime Minister in such a\r\nGovernment. He is a \"safe\" man, without taint of fanaticism. His sincerity\r\nfor the improvement of the lot of the poor does not compel him to\r\nextravagant speech on the subject, and his imagination is sufficient to\r\nexclude dullness of view. He has proved that the application of Socialist\r\nprinciples does not require any violent disturbance of the existing order,\r\nand is compatible with social respectability and political authority. A\r\npublic opinion that would revolt against the notion of an ex-workman\r\nbecoming Prime Minister would not be outraged in any way by Mr. MacDonald\r\nholding that office. Mr. Burns and Mr. Hardie have remained in their own\r\nand in the public eye representatives of the working class, all education\r\nnotwithstanding. Mr. MacDonald has long cut himself off from the labouring\r\nclass of his boyhood. He has adapted himself easily and naturally to the\r\nlife and manners of the wealthier professional classes, and he moves\r\nwithout constraint in the social world of high politics, as one born to the\r\nbusiness. No recognition of the workman is possible in Mr. Ramsay\r\nMacDonald's case, and this fact is greatly in his favour with the\r\nmultitudes who still hold that England should be ruled by \"gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. D. Lloyd George is a striking figure in our new democracy,\r\nand his character and position are to be noted. It was not as a labour\r\nrepresentative but as the chosen mouthpiece of the working middle class,\r\nenthusiastic for Welsh nationalism, that Mr. Lloyd George entered\r\nParliament in 1890, at the age of twenty-seven. With his entry into the\r\nCabinet, in company with Mr. John Burns, at the Liberal revival in 1905,\r\ngovernment by aristocracy was ended; and when Mr. Lloyd George went from\r\nthe Board of Trade to the Chancellorship of the Exchequer, startling\r\nchanges were predicted in national finance. These predictions were held to\r\nhave been fulfilled in the Budget of 1909. The House of Lords considered\r\nthe financial proposals of the Budget so revolutionary that it took the\r\nunprecedented course of rejecting the Bill, and thus precipitated the\r\ndispute between the two Houses of Parliament, which was brought to a\r\nsatisfactory end by the Parliament Act of 1911. Romantic and idealist from\r\nthe first, and with unconcealed ambition and considerable courage, Mr.\r\nLloyd George, with the strong backing of his Welsh compatriots, fought his\r\nway into the front rank of the Liberal Party during the ten years\r\n(1895-1905) of opposition. More than once Mr. George pitted himself against\r\nMr. Joseph Chamberlain in the days of the Conservative ascendancy and the\r\nSouth African War, and his powers as a Parliamentary debater won general\r\nacknowledgment. In youth Mr. Lloyd George, full of the fervour of Mazzini's\r\ndemocratic teaching, dreamed of Wales as a nation, a republic, with\r\nhimself, perhaps, as its first president. Welsh nationalism could not breed\r\na Home Rule Party as Irish nationalism has done, and Mr. Lloyd George has\r\nfound greater scope for his talents in the Liberal Party. The Welsh\r\n\"question\" has dwindled into a campaign for the Disestablishment of the\r\nChurch in Wales, a warfare of Dissenters and Churchmen, and to Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge there were bigger issues at stake than the position of the Welsh\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RIGHT HON. D. LLOYD GEORGE, M.P.\r\n\r\n_Photo: Reginald Haines, Southampton Row, W.C._]\r\n\r\nAlready Mr. Lloyd George's Budget and his speeches in support of the Budget\r\nhave made the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer familiar to the\r\npeople of Great Britain; and now, in the eager discussion on his Bill for\r\nNational Insurance, that name is still more loudly spoken. Hated by\r\nopponents and praised by admirers, denounced and extolled, Mr. Lloyd George\r\nenjoys the tumult he arouses. His passionate speeches for the poor provoke\r\nthe sympathy of the working class; his denunciations of the rich stir the\r\nanger of all who fear social revolution. Hostile critics deny any\r\nconstructive statesmanship in Mr. Lloyd George's plans and orations, and\r\nprophesy a short-lived tenure of office. Radical supporters hail him as a\r\nsaviour of society, and are confident that under his leadership democracy\r\nwill enter the promised land of peace and prosperity for all. Neutral minds\r\ndoubt whether Mr. Lloyd George is sufficiently well-balanced for the\r\nresponsibilities of high office, and express misgivings lest the era of\r\nsocial reform be inaugurated too rapidly. The obvious danger of a fall\r\nalways confronts ambition in politics, but the danger is only obvious to\r\nthe onlooker. Pressing forward the legislative measures he has set his\r\nheart upon, and impatient to carry out the policy that seems to him of\r\nfirst importance to the State, Mr. Lloyd George pays little heed to the\r\ncriticism of friends or foes. A supreme self-confidence carries him along,\r\nand the spur of ambition is constantly pricking. Political co-operation is\r\ndifficult for such a man, and an indifference to reforms that are not of\r\nhis initiation, and a willingness to wreck legislation that cannot bear his\r\nname, are a weakness in Mr. Lloyd George that may easily produce a fall.\r\nOnly a very strong man can afford to say that a reform shall be carried in\r\nhis way, or not at all, in cheerful disregard of the wishes of colleagues\r\nand followers. Mr. Lloyd George's attitude on the question of Women's\r\nSuffrage is characteristic. Professing a strong belief in the justice of\r\nwomen's enfranchisement, he assumes that he can safely oppose all Women's\r\nSuffrage Bills that are not of his framing, even when these Bills are the\r\nwork of ardent Liberals. He would have the measure postponed until he\r\nhimself can bring in a Reform Bill, to the end that the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen may be associated with his name for all time.\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous to the statesman, the ambition that finds satisfaction less\r\nin the success of a party or the triumph of a cause, than in the personal\r\nvictory. Dangerous, because it brings with it an isolation from friends and\r\ncolleagues. These come to stand coldly aloof, and then, if a slip occurs or\r\na mistake is made, and there comes a fall, no hands are stretched out to\r\nrepair the damage or restore the fallen. The statesman who is suspected of\r\n\"playing for his own hand\" may laugh at the murmurs of discontent amongst\r\nhis followers while all goes well for him, but when he falls he falls\r\nbeyond recovery. No one can foretell the end of Mr. Lloyd George's career,\r\nbut his popularity with the multitude will not make up to him for the want\r\nof support in Parliament should an error of judgment undo him. The pages of\r\npolitical history are strewn with the stories of high careers wrecked in a\r\nfeverish haste for fame, that overlooked dangers close at hand; of eminent\r\npoliticians broken in the full course of active life by the mere\r\nforgetfulness of the existence of other persons. A simple miscalculation of\r\nforces, and from lofty station a minister tumbles into the void.\r\n\r\nThe stability of the working-class leaders makes their future a matter of\r\nfairly safe conjecture. Mr. Lloyd George, romantic in temperament, covetous\r\nof honour, confident of popularity, but heedless of good-will alienated and\r\nof positive ill-will created, has reached the Chancellorship of the\r\nExchequer. Will he climb still higher in office, or will he pass to the\r\nlimbo peopled by those who were and are not? Time alone can tell. But in\r\nthis year of grace 1911 Mr. Lloyd George, incarnation of the hard-working\r\nmiddle class, is a very distinct personality in the government of the\r\ncountry, and his presence in the Cabinet a fact in the history of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT POSITION OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS\r\n\r\nMore than once since 1831 the House of Lords has come into conflict with\r\nthe House of Commons when a Liberal Government has been in power. A\r\ncompromise was effected between the two Houses over the Disestablishment of\r\nthe Irish Church in 1869, the Lords, on the whole, giving way. When the\r\nLords proposed to \"amend\" the Army Reform Bill (for abolishing the purchase\r\nof commissions) in 1871, Gladstone overpowered their opposition by advising\r\nthe Crown to cancel the Royal Warrant which made purchase legal, and to\r\nissue a new warrant ending the sale of commissions. This device completely\r\nworsted the House of Lords, for a refusal to pass the Bill under the\r\ncircumstances merely deprived the holders of commissions of the\r\ncompensation awarded in the Bill. The Army Reform Bill became law, but\r\nstrong objection was taken by many Liberals to the sudden exercise of the\r\nRoyal Prerogative. In 1884 the Lords refused to pass the Bill for the\r\nenfranchisement of the rural labourer unless a Bill was brought in at the\r\nsame time for a redistribution of seats. After some discussion Gladstone\r\nyielded, the Redistribution Bill was drawn up, and passed the Commons\r\nsimultaneously with the Franchise Bill in the Lords.\r\n\r\nSeveral Bills have been rejected or \"amended\" by the Lords since the\r\nLiberals came into power in 1906, and the crisis came when the Budget was\r\nrejected in 1909. In June, 1907, the following resolution was passed by the\r\nHouse of Commons by 432 to 147 votes: \"That in order to give effect to the\r\nwill of the people, as expressed by their elected representatives, it is\r\nnecessary that the power of the other House to alter or reject Bills passed\r\nby this House should be so restricted by law as to secure that within the\r\nlimits of a single Parliament the final decision of the Commons shall\r\nprevail.\" This resolution was embodied in the Parliament Bill of 1911.\r\nBetween 1907 and 1911 came (1) the rejection of the Budget, November, 1909;\r\n(2) the General Election of January, 1910, and the return of a majority of\r\n124 (Liberal, Labour, and Irish Nationalist) in support of the Government;\r\n(3) the passing of resolutions (majority, 105) for limiting the Veto of the\r\nLords; (4) the failure of a joint Conference between leading Liberals and\r\nConservatives on the Veto question, followed by (5) the General Election of\r\nDecember, 1910, and the return of the Liberals with a united majority of\r\n126.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament Bill declared that every Money Bill sent up by the Commons,\r\nif not passed unamended by the Lords within a month, should receive the\r\nRoyal assent and become an Act of Parliament notwithstanding, and that\r\nevery Bill sent up for three successive sessions shall in the third session\r\nbecome an Act of Parliament without the assent of the Lords.\r\n\r\nThe Lords passed this Bill with amendments which the Commons refused to\r\naccept, and the Parliament Bill was returned to the Lords in August. But,\r\nas in 1832, the Prime Minister announced that he had received guarantees\r\nfrom the Crown that peers should be created to secure the passage of the\r\nBill if it was again rejected; and to avoid the making of some three or\r\nfour hundred Liberal peers, Lord Lansdowne--following the example of the\r\nDuke of Wellington--advised the Conservatives in the House of Lords to\r\nrefrain from opposition. The result of this abstention was that the Lords'\r\namendments were not persisted in, and the Bill passed the Lords on August\r\n10th, 1911, by 131 to 114 votes.\r\n\r\nBy this Parliament Act the Lords' veto is now strictly limited. The Lords\r\nmay reject a Bill for two sessions, but if the Commons persist, then the\r\nBill passes into law, whether the Lords approve or disapprove.\r\n\r\nThe real grievance against the House of Lords, from the democratic\r\nstandpoint, has been that its veto was only used when a Liberal government\r\nwas in power. There is not even a pretence by the Upper House of revising\r\nthe measures sent from the Commons by a Conservative ministry; yet over and\r\nover again, and especially in the last five years, Liberal measures have\r\nbeen rejected, or \"amended\" against the will of the Commons, by the Lords\r\nafter the electors have returned the Liberals to power. The permanent and\r\noverwhelming Conservative majority in the Lords acts on the assumption that\r\na Liberal ministry does not represent the will of the people, an assumption\r\nat variance with the present theory of democratic government, and in\r\ncontradiction to the constitutional practice of the Crown. The great size\r\nof the House of Lords makes the difficulty of dealing with this majority so\r\nacute. In 1831 the creation of forty peerages would have been sufficient to\r\nmeet the Tory opposition to the Reform Bill; to-day it is said that about\r\nfour hundred are required to give the Liberals a working majority in the\r\nLords. The rapid making of peers began under George III., but from 1830 to\r\nthe present day Prime Minister after Prime Minister has added to the\r\nmembership of the House of Lords with generous hand. Satire, savage and\r\ncontemptuous, has been directed against the new peers by critics of various\r\nopinions, but still the work of adding to the House of hereditary\r\nlegislators goes gaily on, and Liberal Prime Ministers have been as active\r\nas their Tory opponents in adding to the permanent Conservative majority in\r\nthe Lords; for only a small minority of Liberal peers retain their\r\nallegiance to the Liberal Party.\r\n\r\nThackeray gave us his view of the making of peers in the years when Lord\r\nMelbourne and his Whig successors were steadily adding to the Upper House.\r\n(Between 1835 and 1841 Melbourne made forty-four new peers, and\r\ntwenty-eight more were added by 1856.)\r\n\r\n\"A man becomes enormously rich, or he jobs successfully in the aid of a\r\nMinister, or he wins a great battle, or executes a treaty, or is a clever\r\nlawyer who makes a multitude of fees and ascends the bench; and the country\r\nrewards him for ever with a gold coronet (with more or less balls or\r\nleaves) and a title, and a rank as legislator. 'Your merits are so great,'\r\nsays the nation, 'that your children shall be allowed to reign over us, in\r\na manner. It does not in the least matter that your eldest son is a fool;\r\nwe think your services so remarkable that he shall have the reversion of\r\nyour honours when death vacates your noble shoes.'\"\r\n\r\nJ.H. Bernard, in his \"Theory of the Constitution\" (1835), was no less\r\nemphatic:--\r\n\r\n\"As the affair is managed now, the peerage, though sometimes bestowed as\r\nthe reward of merit, on men who have adorned particular professions, is yet\r\nmuch more frequently--nine times out of ten--employed by the minister of\r\nthe day as his instrument to serve particular views of public policy; and\r\nis often given to actual demerit--to men who hire themselves out to do his\r\ncommands through thick and thin. The peerage is now full of persons who\r\nhave obtained possession of it by disreputable means.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of satire and hostile criticism members of the House of Lords\r\nhave always enjoyed a considerable social popularity. They are widely\r\nesteemed for their titles, even by those who denounce hereditary\r\nlegislators and desire to abolish the Second Chamber.\r\n\r\nDisraeli created six new peers in 1867-8, and seventeen more from 1875 to\r\n1880, in addition to conferring the earldom of Beaconsfield on himself. Yet\r\nDisraeli had written in \"Coningsby\" (1844):--\r\n\r\n\"We owe the English peerage to three sources: the spoliation of the Church,\r\nthe open and flagrant sale of its honours by the elder Stuarts, and the\r\nborough-mongering of our own times. Those are the three main sources of the\r\nexisting peerage of England, and, in my opinion, disgraceful ones.\"\r\n\r\nGladstone made fifty peers in his four premierships, and Mr. Herbert Paul,\r\nthe Liberal historian of \"Modern England,\" makes the following comments:--\r\n\r\n\"No minister since Pitt had done so much as Mr. Gladstone to enlarge and\r\nthereby to strengthen the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone was lavish in his distribution of peerages, and rich men who\r\nwere politically active, either in the House of Commons or behind the\r\nscenes, might hope to be rewarded with safe seats elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PASSING OF THE PARLIAMENT BILL IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS\r\n\r\n_From the Drawing by S. Begg._]\r\n\r\nSir Henry Campbell-Bannerman exceeded all previous records of the last\r\ncentury by making twenty new peers in less than two years--1905 to\r\n1907--and Mr. Asquith maintained this vigorous policy by thirteen new\r\ncreations in the first year of his premiership. Already many of these\r\npeers, whose titles are not more than six years old, vote with the\r\nConservatives. Great Britain is now the only country in the world that\r\ncombines a democratic form of government with a second chamber of\r\nhereditary legislators, and many proposals are on foot for the reform of\r\nthe House of Lords. While the Conservatives are more anxious to change the\r\nconstitution of the Upper House, and to make it a stronger and more\r\nrepresentative assembly, the Liberals prefer that its power of veto should\r\nbe abolished. No Act of Parliament was required to abolish the veto of the\r\nCrown on Acts of Parliament, but the growth of a democratic public opinion\r\ndid not prove strong enough to end the veto of the Lords on the Bills\r\npassed by a Liberal majority in the Commons, and therefore the Parliament\r\nAct was passed.\r\n\r\nTHE POPULARITY OF THE CROWN\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the Crown has become increasingly wider and more general\r\nin the years that have seen the British people steadily taking up the work\r\nof self-government. The fear of a hostile demonstration by the inhabitants\r\nof London kept William IV. from visiting the Mansion House in 1830, and the\r\ndeath of that monarch in 1837 evoked no national mourning. Queen Victoria,\r\nunknown to the people on her accession, had the very great advantage of\r\nLord Melbourne's political advice in the early years of her reign. Her\r\nmarriage, in 1840, with the Prince Consort--who himself learnt much from\r\nMelbourne--brought a wise counsellor to the assistance of the throne. \"I\r\nstudy the politics of the day with great industry,\" wrote the Prince\r\nConsort. \"I speak quite openly to the Ministers on all subjects, and\r\nendeavour quietly to be of as much use to Victoria as I can.\" The Prince\r\nConsort saw quickly that \"if monarchy was to rise in popularity, it could\r\nonly be by the sovereign leading a good life, and keeping quite aloof from\r\nparty.\" The days of a profligate court and of \"the King's friends\" in\r\npolitics were past and gone; the royal _influence_ was to succeed the royal\r\n_prerogative_.[87]\r\n\r\nThe aloofness from political partisanship has been faithfully maintained by\r\nthe successors of Queen Victoria, and great as the royal influence may be\r\nin the social life of the wealthier classes, it is certain that no such\r\ninfluence operates in the casting of votes by the people at Parliamentary\r\nelections. No one suspects the King of desiring the return of Liberals over\r\nTories, or of favouring the Tory programme rather than the Liberal; and\r\nthis neutrality is the surest guarantee of the continued popularity of the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\nFor some years in the late 'seventies and early 'eighties of the nineteenth\r\ncentury Republicanism was the creed of many ardent working-class Radicals\r\nin England. Charles Bradlaugh was its chief exponent, and both Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain and the late Sir Charles Dilke were regarded as Republicans\r\nbefore they entered Gladstone's Ministry in 1880. The Republican movement\r\nwaned before Bradlaugh's death. He himself was \"led to feel that agitation\r\nfor an ideal form of government was less directly fruitful than agitation\r\nagainst the abuses of class privilege; and in the last dozen years of his\r\nlife, his political work went mainly to reforms within the lines of the\r\nConstitution.\"[88]\r\n\r\nWith the rise of the Socialist movement in England in 1884-5, and the\r\ncelebration of the Queen's Jubilee in 1887, Republicanism became utterly\r\nmoribund, and nothing save an attempt on the part of the sovereign to take\r\na definite side in party politics, or a notorious lapse from the morals\r\nrequired of persons in office of State, could revive it.\r\n\r\nThe interest in Socialism was fatal to the Republican movement, because it\r\nturned the enthusiasm of the active spirits in democratic politics from the\r\ndesire for radical changes in the _form_ of government, to the crusade for\r\neconomic changes, and the belief in a coming social revolution. The\r\nexistence of monarchy seemed a small and comparatively unimportant affair\r\nto men and women who were hoping to get poverty abolished, and the\r\nlandlords and capitalists expropriated either by direct revolution, or by\r\nthe act of a House of Commons, dominated by working men with Socialist\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nThe national celebrations at the Queen's Jubilee in 1887 marked the\r\nbeginning of the popular revival in pageantry and official ceremonial. In\r\nthe Church of England this revival began some forty years earlier, and it\r\nhas, in our day, changed the whole conduct of public worship. The revival\r\nof Roman Catholicism in England with its processions and solemn ritual has\r\nbeen equally significant. By gratifying the common human instinct for\r\nspectacle and drama the monarchy has gained the popular affections.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs scoffed at pageants and symbols; the earlier Puritans had\r\nproscribed ceremonial as savouring of idolatry, and feared any\r\nmanifestation of beauty as a snare of the devil. In the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century, England began to throw off the shackles of Puritanism,\r\nand to lose all interest in Whiggery. The new democracy was neither coldly\r\nDeist, nor austerely Republican. It has shown no inclination to inaugurate\r\na reign of \"pure reason\" in religion or politics, but has boldly and\r\ncheerfully adopted symbolism and pageantry. Friendly societies and trade\r\nunions have their badges, banners, and buttons. The Roman Catholic Church\r\ngrows in popularity with the working class, and in many towns and cities\r\nthe Church of England and the Salvation Army are distinctly popular. On the\r\nother hand, the Nonconformist churches confess annually to a decreasing\r\nmembership, and Secularist and Ethical societies have but the smallest\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nThe royal processions and the pageantry of monarchy have provided a\r\nspectacular display that average human nature enjoys. The symbols and\r\ntrappings of monarchy must be shown if the sovereign is to be popular; they\r\nadd to the gaiety of life, and people are grateful for the warmth of colour\r\nthey impart to our grey streets. The sovereign in encouraging the renewed\r\nand growing love for pageants and ceremonial has discerned the signs of the\r\ntimes. Modern democracy does not desire that kings or priests shall rule;\r\nbut it does require that they shall on State occasions and in the\r\nperformance of their office, be clad in kingly and priestly robes, and by\r\ntheir proceedings enrich the dignity of public life, and the beauty of\r\npublic worship.\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOCRATIC IDEALS: SOCIALISM AND SOCIAL REFORM\r\n\r\nThe rise of Socialism in the 'eighties not only diverted the attention of\r\nworking-class leaders from political reform, but it substituted for the\r\ndestruction of monarchy and the House of Lords a reconstruction of society\r\nas the goal of democracy; and the Socialist teaching has been of enduring\r\nand penetrating influence.\r\n\r\nFifty years earlier in the nineteenth century, Robert Owen had preached a\r\nSocialist crusade with strenuous persuasion--but, ignoring politics, he\r\noutlived the temporary success of his cause. The utopian Socialism of Owen\r\nflourished and died, as Chartism, under different treatment, flourished and\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nThe \"scientific\" Socialism of Karl Marx was planned on stronger\r\nfoundations. It brought a message of hope; it revealed how the change was\r\nto be wrought that would \"emancipate the workers of the world from the\r\nslavery of wage service\"; and it insisted that this change was inevitable.\r\nOn the Continent, and more particularly in Germany, the Social Democratic\r\nParty has gained an enormous working-class support, and every election adds\r\nto its strength.\r\n\r\nIn England the Social Democratic Federation--now the Social Democratic\r\nParty--was founded in 1884 by Mr. H.M. Hyndman; but in spite of its\r\nuntiring efforts, it has never won the sympathy of the trade unions, nor\r\nthe confidence of the working-class electorate. Its Parliamentary\r\ncandidatures rarely attract attention, and it is not a force in Labour\r\npolitics. Nevertheless, indirectly, the influence of the Social Democratic\r\nParty has been very considerable. Mr. John Burns, and many another Labour\r\nleader, have passed through its ranks, and a social conscience has been\r\nmade sensitive to the miseries of the poor, largely by the voices--that\r\nwill not be silenced--of this comparatively small company.\r\n\r\nThe Fabian Society also began its work of educating public opinion to\r\nSocialism in 1884, but, unlike the Social Democratic Federation, it made no\r\nproposals for the creation of a Socialist Party or the organisation of the\r\nworking class into a separate political party. Mainly, its influence can be\r\nseen in the increase of statistical knowledge and of State interference in\r\nthe conditions of life and labour in the working class.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Labour Party was not formed till 1892, and while professing\r\nSocialism, it has aimed rather at securing the return of labour members to\r\nParliament, and to local governing councils than at the conversion of the\r\nworking class to a dogmatic social democracy. Often frankly opportunist and\r\nexperimental, the Independent Labour Party and its offspring, the Labour\r\nParty in the House of Commons, have followed the national custom in\r\npolitics of attacking and redressing evident evils, and have done this with\r\nconsiderable success.\r\n\r\nBut while the Socialists have compelled the attention of all classes to\r\nexisting social ills, and have made social reform the chief concern of all\r\npoliticians, the idea of a social democracy steadily recedes from the\r\npolitical vision, and the conscious movement to Socialism falters.\r\nSocialist workmen in Parliament or on city councils soon find themselves\r\nabsorbed in the practical work of legislation or administration, and learn\r\nthat there is neither leisure nor outlet for revolutionary propaganda. The\r\nengrossing character of public work destroys the old inclination to break\r\nup the existing order, for the Socialist member of Parliament, or city\r\ncouncillor interested in his work, has become part of the machinery\r\nresponsible for the existing order, and without losing his sympathy for the\r\nlabouring people is content that the amelioration of society shall come, as\r\nit now seems to him it must come, by slow and orderly stages and without\r\nviolence. The very return of so many Labour members to Parliament and to\r\nlocal councils has damped down the fires of Socialism, by placing in\r\npositions of authority and responsibility, and thereby withdrawing them\r\nfrom the army of disaffection, the ablest leaders of the working-class\r\nmovement. The Labour member who cannot settle down to legislative or\r\nadministrative work, but attempts to play the agitator's part in the House\r\nof Commons or the council chamber, is generally doomed to banishment from\r\nofficial public life, and is allowed to remain an agitator.\r\n\r\nMr. John Burns may be denounced as a renegade by Socialist critics, but a\r\nworking-class electorate returns him to Parliament. Mr. Cunninghame Graham\r\nand Mr. Victor Grayson may be applauded for their consistency by Socialist\r\naudiences, but working-class constituencies are loth to return such\r\nrepresentatives to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nAs Socialism quietly passes out of the vision of the political world, and\r\nfrom a definite inspiration to democracy becomes a dim and remote\r\npossibility of the future, Social Reform takes its place. Not only in Great\r\nBritain, but throughout Europe, the social reformers or \"revisionists\" are\r\ngaining the mastery over the scientific Marxian Socialists in democratic\r\npolitics. In Great Britain where \"practical,\" or experimental, politics\r\nhave always prevailed over political theory, the passing of positive\r\nSocialist dogma is naturally more obvious. Social Reform is now the cry of\r\nLiberals and Conservatives alike. The old Liberal doctrines of _laissez\r\nfaire_, unrestricted competition, and the personal liberty of the subject\r\nare as dead as the Stuart doctrine of the divine right of kings. The old\r\nLiberal hostility to State interference in trade or commerce, and to\r\ncompulsory social legislation has melted away at the awakened social\r\nconscience. It still has its adherents--Lord Cromer and Mr. Harold Cox\r\nrepeat the ancient watch-words of Victorian Liberalism, and they are\r\nregarded with a respect mingled with curiosity, as strange survivals of a\r\nfar-off age--but no popular echo follows their utterances. Pensions for the\r\naged, better provision for the sick and the infirm, a more careful\r\nattention to the well-being of children, national health, some cure for\r\ndestitution, and some remedy for unemployment--these are the matters that a\r\nLiberal Government is concerned about to-day. And the Conservatives are no\r\nless sincere in their willingness to help in these matters. Legislative\r\nproposals for social reform are treated as non-party questions, and the\r\nchief item in the Conservative programme, Tariff Reform, was adopted and is\r\nadvocated mainly as a social reform, a cure for industrial evils, and the\r\nmisery of unemployment.\r\n\r\nSocialism proposed the abolition of poverty, and the common ownership and\r\ncontrol of the land and the means of production, distribution, and exchange\r\nas the solution of economic questions.\r\n\r\nSocial Reform proposes to mitigate the hardships of life for the multitude,\r\nand, while leaving land and capital in private hands, to compel by taxation\r\nprovision for the wants of the people. Its aim is the abolition of\r\ndestitution by State assistance to voluntary effort, and the gradual\r\nraising of the standard of life. It does not propose to remove the cause of\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nSocialism would place the democracy in possession of the means of wealth.\r\nSocial Reform requires the State to tax wealth and provide for the people.\r\nIt promises a living wage, decent housing accommodation, an insurance\r\nagainst unemployment, and security in old age, and leaves the question of\r\nnational ownership or private ownership to be settled by posterity.\r\n\r\nLAND REFORM AND THE SINGLE TAX\r\n\r\nApart from the ideals of Socialism, the democratic ideal of a community\r\nowning the full value of its land was presented by Henry George, an\r\nAmerican economist, in 1879, and his book \"Progress and Poverty,\" was at\r\nonce received with enthusiasm by certain reformers in England and America.\r\nGeorge visited England in 1881, 1884, and 1889, and his visits resulted in\r\na strong movement for the taxation of land values. This movement has been\r\ninspired by an ideal of a democratic community as definite as the Socialist\r\nideal, and it has grown steadily in popular favour as the justice of a tax\r\non land values has been recognised. \"Progress and Poverty\" is the bible of\r\nthe Land Reformers, as Marx's \"Capital\" is (or was) the bible of\r\nSocialists. It is claimed that a tax on land values is the true remedy of\r\nsocial and economic ills, and that democracy can eradicate the root-cause\r\nof poverty by such a tax. In this belief the followers of Henry George have\r\npreached the Single Tax, as it is called, with unquenchable fervour, and\r\nthe Liberal Party has been gradually won over--if not to the Single Tax, at\r\nleast to a tax on land values. Many Conservatives, too, favour the taxation\r\nof land values in cities, and all the principal municipalities have\r\npetitioned Parliament in favour of this method of taxation. But it is the\r\ndemocratic ideals of Henry George that have been the life of the movement\r\nfor the Single Tax, and but for these ideals the movement would never have\r\nbecome a living influence towards democracy, or inspired a social\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe charm about the Single Tax propaganda is that its ideals of democracy\r\ndo not discourage the practical politician and the average citizen from\r\nsupporting what seems a necessary and reasonable proposal. Without\r\ncommitting themselves at all to Henry George's full scheme for the total\r\nabolition of land monopoly by a tax of twenty shillings in the pound on all\r\nland values, and without abandoning the common British suspicion of the\r\ndoctrinaire and the political idealist, the ordinary shopkeeper and\r\nhouseholder are quite of opinion that urban values in land can be taxed\r\nlegitimately for the benefit of the community, and that democracy would do\r\nwell to decree some moderate tax on land values for the relief of the\r\novertaxed non-landowner.\r\n\r\nSo the taxation of land values is presented by its advocates as a social\r\nreform more radical and democratic than all other social reforms, as a\r\nreform that in fact would make democracy master of its own land, and the\r\npeople free from the curse of poverty; and it is accepted by the great mass\r\nof working people as a just and useful method of raising revenue for local\r\nand imperial needs.\r\n\r\nSocialism, social reform, the Single Tax--various are the ideals of a\r\ndemocratic people at work at the business of government, and various are\r\nthe means proposed to establish the democracy in economic freedom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD-WIDE MOVEMENT: ITS STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS\r\n\r\nEAST AND WEST\r\n\r\nThe movement towards democracy is world-wide to-day, and the political\r\nconstitutions of the West are desired with fervour in the East.\r\n\r\nFor generations there has been agitation in Russia for representative\r\ngovernment, and men and women--in countless numbers--have sacrificed\r\nwealth, reputation, liberty, and life itself in the cause of political\r\nfreedom. On the establishment in 1906 of the Duma, a national chamber of\r\nelected members, there was general rejoicing, because it seemed that, at\r\nlength, autocracy was to give place to representative government. But the\r\nhopes of the political reformers were short lived. The Duma still exists,\r\nbut its powers were closely restricted in 1907, and the franchise has been\r\nnarrowed, to secure an overwhelming preponderance of the wealthy, so that\r\nit is altogether misleading to regard it as a popular assembly.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt and in India the Nationalist movements are directed to\r\nself-government, and are led by men who have, in most cases, spent some\r\nyears at an English University, or have been trained at the English Bar.\r\nResidence in England, and a close study of British politics make the\r\neducated Indian anxious for political rights in his own country, similar to\r\nthose that are given to him in Great Britain. In England the Indian has all\r\nthe political rights of a British subject. He can vote for a member of\r\nParliament, he can even be a member of the House of Commons. On two\r\noccasions in recent years, an Indian has been elected to Parliament: Mr.\r\nDadabhai Naoroji sat as Liberal M.P. for Finsbury, 1892-5; Sir M.M.\r\nBhownagree as a Conservative for Bethnal Green, 1895-1906. Back in his\r\nnative land, the Indian finds that he belongs to a subject race, and that\r\nthe British garrison will neither admit him to social equality, nor permit\r\nhim the right of legislation. Hence with eyes directed to Western forms of\r\ngovernment, the Indian is discontented with the bureaucracy that rules his\r\nland, and disaffected from the Imperial power. But so many are the nations\r\nin India, and so poverty-stricken is the great multitude of its peasantry\r\nthat the Nationalist movement can touch but the fringe of the population,\r\nand the millions of India live patiently and contentedly under the British\r\nCrown. Nevertheless, the national movement grows steadily in numbers and in\r\ninfluence, for it is difficult for those who, politically minded, have once\r\nknown political freedom, to resign themselves to political subjection.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt the Nationalist movement is naturally smaller and more\r\nconcentrated than in India and the racial divisions hinder its unity. Egypt\r\nis nominally under the suzerainty of Turkey, though occupied by Great\r\nBritain, and now that Turkey has set up a Constitution and a Parliament,\r\npatriotic Egyptian politicians are impatient at the blocking out by the\r\nBritish authorities of every proposal for self-government.\r\n\r\nAs in India, so in Egypt: it is the men of education who are responsible\r\nfor the Nationalist movement. And in both countries it is the desire to\r\nexperiment in representative government, to test the constitutional forms\r\nin common use in the West, and to practise the responsibilities of\r\ncitizenship, that stimulates the movement. The unwillingness of the British\r\nGovernment to gratify this desire explains the hostility to British rule in\r\nIndia and Egypt.\r\n\r\nJapan received a Constitution from the Emperor in 1890, and in 1891 its\r\nDiet was formally opened with great national enthusiasm. It is a\r\ntwo-chamber Parliament--a Council of nobles, and a popularly elected\r\nassembly--and only in the last few years have the business men given their\r\nattention to it. Although the Cabinet is influenced by Japanese public\r\nopinion, it is not directly responsible to the Diet, but is the Ministry of\r\nthe Mikado. The resolution of the Japanese statesmen of forty years ago to\r\nmake Japan a world-power made Constitutional Government, in their eyes, a\r\nnecessity for the nation.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark all possess democratic\r\nconstitutions, and only the removal of sex disabilities in the latter two\r\nis needed to achieve complete adult suffrage. Finland established complete\r\ndemocracy nine years ago, and, with equal electoral districts, complete\r\nadult suffrage, and the free election of women equally with men to its\r\nDiet, is a model democratic state. But the liberties of Finland are gravely\r\nthreatened by the Russian Government, and there is no security for the\r\nFinns that their excellent self-government will be preserved. In Germany,\r\nwith universal manhood suffrage, the struggle is to make the Government\r\nresponsible to the elected Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThe British self-governing Colonies show a tendency of democracy to\r\nfederate. The Australian Colonies are federated into a Commonwealth, and\r\ntheir example has been followed by the South African Colonies. New Zealand\r\nand Australia are at one in their franchise, which allows no barrier of\r\nsex; but South Africa still restricts the vote to males. In Australia the\r\nworking class are in power, and the Commonwealth Prime Minister is a Labour\r\nrepresentative. There is no willingness to grant political rights to those\r\nwho are not of European race, either in South Africa or in Australia; and\r\nthe universal republic dreamed of by eighteenth century democrats, a\r\nrepublic which should know no racial or \"colour\" bar, is not in the vision\r\nof the modern colonial statesmen of democracy, who are frankly exclusive.\r\nOnly in New Zealand does a native race elect its own members to\r\nParliament--and four Maori M.P.'s are returned.\r\n\r\nTYRANNY UNDER DEMOCRATIC FORMS\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that democratic and republican forms of government\r\nare no guarantee that the nation possesses political liberty.\r\n\r\nMexico, nominally a republic under President Diaz, was in reality a\r\nmilitary autocracy of the severest kind. The South American Republics are\r\nmerely unstable monarchies, at the mercy of men who can manipulate the\r\npolitical machinery and get control of the army.\r\n\r\nIt is too early yet to decide whether the constitutional form of government\r\nset up in Turkey in 1908, or the republic created on the abolition of\r\nmonarchy in Portugal in 1910, mark national movements to democracy. In\r\nneither country is there evidence that general political freedom has been\r\nthe goal of the successful revolutionist, or that the people have obtained\r\nany considerable measure of political power or civil liberty. Ambitious and\r\nunscrupulous men can make full use of republican and democratic forms to\r\ngain political mastery over their less cunning fellows, and no machinery of\r\ngovernment has ever yet been devised that will safeguard the weak and the\r\nfoolish from the authority of the strong and the capable.\r\n\r\nThose who put their trust in theories of popular sovereignty, and urge the\r\nreferendum and initiative as the surer instruments of democracy than\r\nParliamentary representation, may recall that a popular plebiscite\r\norganised by Napoleon in 1802 conferred on him the Consulate for life; that\r\nLouis Napoleon was made President of the French Republic in 1848 by a\r\npopular vote, obtained a new constitution by a plebiscite in 1851, and a\r\nyear later arranged another plebiscite which declared him hereditary\r\nEmperor, Napoleon III. France, where naturally Rousseau's theories have\r\nmade the deepest impression, has since the Revolution gloried in the right\r\nof the \"sovereign people\" to overthrow the government, and its elected\r\nrepresentatives have been alternately at the mercy of dictators and social\r\nrevolutionists.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the stability of the British Government, rooted in the main\r\non the traditional belief in the representation of the electorate, would\r\nseem to make more surely for national progress and wider political liberty\r\nthan the alternation of revolution and reaction which France has known in\r\nthe last hundred and twenty years.\r\n\r\nEngland has not been without its popular outbursts against what the\r\nAmerican poet called \"the never-ending audacity of elected persons,\" but\r\nthese outbursts are commonly accepted as manifestations of intolerable\r\nconditions; and while the outbursts are repressed means are taken by\r\nGovernment to amend the conditions. When the Government fails to amend\r\nthings, the House of Commons takes the matter up; and if the Commons\r\nneglect to do so, then the electors make it plain that amendment and reform\r\nare necessary by returning men to Parliament pledged to change matters, and\r\nby rejecting those who have failed to meet the situation.\r\n\r\nTHE OBVIOUS DANGERS\r\n\r\nThe dangers that threaten democracy are obvious. Universal adult suffrage,\r\nshort Parliaments, proportional representation, equal electoral districts,\r\nsecond ballots--none of these things can insure democracy against\r\ncorruption. For a government which rests on the will of a people--a will\r\nexpressed by the election of representatives--is inevitably exposed to all\r\nthe evils attendant on the unruly wills and affections of the average man.\r\n\r\nThe orator can play upon the feelings of the crowd, and sway multitudes\r\nagainst a better judgment; and he has greater chance of working mischief\r\nwhen a referendum or other direct instrument of democracy is in vogue than\r\nhe has when government is by elected representatives. For the party system,\r\nitself open to plenty of criticism, constantly defeats the orator by the\r\nsuperior power of organisation. Hence it frequently happens at\r\nParliamentary elections that a candidate whose meetings are enthusiastic\r\nand well attended fails lamentably at the poll. His followers are a crowd;\r\nthey are not a party. They do not know each other, and they have not the\r\nconfidence that comes of membership in a large society.\r\n\r\nPARTY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nIf the orator is a menace to the wise decisions of the people by a\r\nreferendum, the party organiser and political \"boss\" can easily be a curse\r\nto representative government on party lines. By all manner of unholy\r\ndevices he can secure votes for his candidate and his party, and he has\r\nraised (or lowered) the simple business of getting the people to choose\r\ntheir representative into the art of electioneering. The triumph of\r\npolitical principles by the election of persons to carry out those\r\nprinciples becomes of less importance than the successful working of the\r\nparty machine, when the boss and the organiser are conspicuous. Patronage\r\nbecomes the method for keeping the party in power, and the promise of\r\nrewards and spoils enables an opposition to defeat the Government and\r\nobtain office. To be outside the party is to lose all chance of sharing in\r\nthe spoils, and to take an interest in politics means, under these\r\ncircumstances, to expect some consideration in the distribution of honours.\r\n\r\nThe \"spoils system\" is notorious in America, but in England it has become\r\npractically impossible for a man to take any serious part in politics\r\nexcept by becoming part of the machine. An independent attitude means\r\nisolation. To belong to a party--Liberal, Unionist, or Labour--and to\r\ncriticise its policy, or differ from its leaders, is resented as\r\nimpertinence. The machine is master of the man. A troublesome and dangerous\r\ncritic is commonly bought or silenced. He is given office in the\r\nGovernment, or rewarded with a legal appointment; perhaps made a peer if\r\nhis tastes are in that direction. A critic who cannot command a\r\nconsiderable backing among the electorate will probably be driven out of\r\npublic life. The disinterested activity in politics that puts the\r\ncommonwealth before party gain is naturally discouraged by the party\r\norganisers.\r\n\r\nYet when public interest in national affairs sinks to the merely sporting\r\ninstinct of \"backing your candidate\" at elections as a horse is backed at\r\nrace meetings, and of \"shouting for your party\" as men shout for their\r\nfavourite football team, or sinks still lower to the mercenary speculation\r\nof personal gain or loss on election results, then another danger comes\r\nin--the indifference of the average honest citizen to all politics, and the\r\ncynical disbelief in political honesty.\r\n\r\nThe warnings of John Stuart Mill against leaving politics to the\r\npoliticians and against the professional position may be quoted:\r\n\r\n\"Representative institutions are of little value, and may be a mere\r\ninstrument of tyranny or intrigue when the generality of electors are not\r\nsufficiently interested in their own government to give their vote; or, if\r\nthey vote at all, do not bestow their suffrages on public grounds, but sell\r\nthem for money, or vote at the beck of some one who has control over them,\r\nor whom for private reasons they desire to propitiate. Popular elections as\r\nthus practised, instead of a security against misgovernment, are but an\r\nadditional wheel in its machinery.\"\r\n\r\nMill himself was a striking example of the entirely disinterested\r\npolitician, who, caring a great deal more for principles than for party,\r\nfinds little favour with the electors, and less with the party managers,\r\nand retires from politics to the relief of his fellows.\r\n\r\nA general lack of interest in politics can prove fatal to democracy. The\r\nparty managers, without the fear of the electorate before their eyes, will\r\nincrease the number of salaried officials and strengthen their position by\r\njudicious appointments. Nominally, these inspectors and officers will be\r\nrequired for the public service, and the appointments will be justified on\r\npatriotic grounds. There will be little criticism in Parliament, because\r\nthe party not in power will be anxious to create similar \"jobs\" when its\r\nown turn comes. Besides, as the public pays for these officials, there is\r\nno drain on the party funds; and this is a matter of congratulation to\r\nparty managers, who are always anxious not to spend more than they can help\r\non the political machinery.\r\n\r\nBUREAUCRACY\r\n\r\nBut the horde of officials and inspectors will change democracy into\r\nbureaucracy, and the discovery is sometimes made too late that a land is\r\nruled by permanent officials, and not by elected representatives. The\r\nelected representatives may sit and pass laws, but the bureaucracy which\r\nadministers them will be the real authority.\r\n\r\nIt may be an entirely honest and efficient bureaucracy, as free from\r\npolitical partisanship as our British Civil Service and police-court\r\nmagistracy are, but if it is admitted to be outside the jurisdiction of the\r\nHouse of Commons, and to be under no obedience to local councils, and if\r\nits powers involve a close inquisition into the lives of the people, and\r\ninclude the right to interfere daily with these lives, then bureaucracy and\r\nnot democracy is the actual government.\r\n\r\nA host of salaried political workers--agents, organisers, secretaries,\r\netc.--will make popular representative government a mere matter of\r\npolitical rivalry, an affair of \"ins and outs,\" and by this development of\r\nthe party system will exclude from active politics all who are not loyal to\r\nthe \"machine,\" and are not strong enough to break it. But a host of public\r\nofficers--inspectors, clerks, etc.--paid out of the public funds will do\r\nmore than pervert representative government: they will make it subordinate\r\nto the permanent official class; and bureaucracy, once firmly in the\r\nsaddle, is harder to get rid of than the absolutism of kings, or the rule\r\nof an aristocracy.\r\n\r\nYet a permanent Civil Service is better in every way in a democracy than a\r\nCivil Service which lives and dies with a political party, and is changed\r\nwith the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the best thing for democracy is that the paid workers in\r\npolitics should be as few as possible, and the number of salaried state\r\nofficials strictly limited. The fewer the paid political workers, the fewer\r\npeople will be concerned to maintain the efficiency of the political\r\nmachine, and the more freely will the electorate act in the choice of its\r\nrepresentatives. The fewer the salaried officials of State, the less\r\ninspection and restriction, and the less encouragement to habits of\r\nsubmission in the people. Democracy must depend on a healthy, robust sense\r\nof personal responsibility in its citizens, and every increase in the\r\ninspectorate tends to diminish this personal responsibility, and to breed a\r\n\"servile state\" that will fall a willing prey to tyranny and bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whilst in self-defence democracy will avoid increasing its\r\nofficials, it will distinguish between officials and employees. It is bound\r\nto add to the number of its employees every year, as its municipal and\r\nimperial responsibilities grow steadily larger, and these employees,\r\nrightly regarded as public servants, cannot threaten to become our masters.\r\n\r\nWORKING-CLASS ASCENDANCY\r\n\r\nStill one more danger to democracy may be mentioned, and that is the notion\r\nthat from the working class must necessarily come our best rulers.\r\n\r\n\"Rulers are not wise by reason of their number or their poverty, or their\r\nreception of a weekly wage instead of a monthly salary or yearly income. It\r\nis worse and more unpleasant and more dangerous to be ruled by many fools\r\nthan by one fool, or a few fools. The tyranny of an ignorant and cowardly\r\nmob is a worse tyranny than the tyranny of an ignorant and cowardly clique\r\nor individual.\r\n\r\n\"Workers are not respectable or to be considered because they work more\r\nwith their hands or feet than with their brains, but because the work they\r\ndo is good. If it is not good work they do, they are as unprofitable as any\r\nother wasters. A plumber is not a useful or admirable creature because he\r\nplumbs (if he plumbs ignorantly or dishonestly, he is often either a\r\nmanslayer or a murderer), but because he plumbs well, and saves the\r\ncommunity from danger and damp, disease, and fire and water. Makers of\r\nuseless machine-made ornaments are, however 'horny-handed,' really\r\n'anti-social persons,' baneful to the community as far as their bad work\r\ngoes; more baneful, possibly, than the consumers of these bad articles,\r\nquite as baneful as the _entrepreneurs_ who employ them.\r\n\r\n\"The only good institutions are those that do good work; the only good work\r\ndone is that which produces good results, whether they be direct, as the\r\nplough-man's, or navvy's, or sailor's; or indirect, as the policeman, or\r\nthe schoolmaster, or the teacher of good art, or the writer of books that\r\nare worth reading. A man is no better or wiser than others by reason of his\r\nposition or lack of position, but by reason of his stronger body, wiser\r\nhead, better skill, greater endurance, keener courage.\"[89]\r\n\r\nThere it is. Democracy needs for its counsellors, legislators and\r\nministers, strength, wisdom, skill, endurance and courage, and must get\r\nthese qualities in whomsoever they are to be found. Democracy can afford\r\nthe widest range of choice in the election of popular representatives, or\r\nit will never reach its full stature.\r\n\r\nIn the choice of its representatives, a democracy will do well to elect\r\nthose who know the life of the working people, and who share its toils;\r\njust as it will do well to shun the mere talker, and to seek out for itself\r\ncandidates for election rather than have candidates thrust upon its\r\nattention by some caucus in London. But the main thing is that it should\r\nfirst discern men and women of ability and of character and then elect them\r\nfor its representatives, rejecting those, it may be of more dazzling\r\nqualities, who are unstable in mind and consumed with vanity. It would be\r\nwell if the elected representative were always an inhabitant of the county\r\nor the borough, known to his neighbours, and of tested worth. True, the\r\nprophet is often without honour in his own country, and a constituency acts\r\nwisely in electing a representative of national repute. But to search for a\r\nman of wealth who will subsidise every club and charitable institution in\r\nthe constituency, and to rejoice when such a candidate is procured from\r\nsome political headquarters, is a wretched proceeding in a democratic\r\nstate. The member who buys a constituency by his gifts will always feel\r\nentitled to sell his constituents should occasion arise.\r\n\r\nAgain, the delegate theory of representation can be a danger to democracy.\r\n\r\nA Parliamentary representative is something better than a mechanical\r\ncontrivance for registering the opinions of electors on certain subjects.\r\nOtherwise all Parliamentary debate is a mockery. A representative he is of\r\nthe majority of electors, but he must act freely and with initiative. Often\r\nenough he may be constrained to vote, not as many of his constituents would\r\nprefer, but using his own judgment. Of course when the choice is between\r\nobedience to the party whip and the wishes of his constituents, and\r\npersonal conviction is with the latter, then at all costs the decision\r\nshould be to stand by his constituents, or popular representation is a\r\ndelusion.\r\n\r\nTo-day the pressure is far greater from the party whips than from the\r\nconstituents, especially when in so many cases election expenses are paid,\r\nin part at least, from the party funds. And to overcome this constant\r\ndanger to popular representation a sure plan would be the payment of all\r\nnecessary election expenses out of the local rates, and the prohibition by\r\nlaw of all payments by the candidate or by political associations. When\r\nmembers are paid for their attendance in Parliament, far better would it\r\nbe, too, if such payment were made by the constituents in each case, and\r\nnot from the national exchequer.[90] Worse than the delegate theory is the\r\nopinion that a representative of the people is in Parliament chiefly to\r\nkeep his party in power. Political parties are inevitable, and they are\r\neffective and convenient when principles divide people. But popular\r\nrepresentation is older than a party system of government, and when it\r\nbecomes utterly subordinate to the welfare of parties it is time for a\r\ndemocratic people to realise the possible loss of their instrument of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain is not partial to groups, it has always broadly been divided\r\npolitically into two camps, but a few men of strong independent judgment\r\nare invaluable in a popular assembly. There need be no fear lest\r\ngovernments totter and fall at the presence of men who dare to take a line\r\nof their own, and to speak out boldly on occasion. The bulk of members of\r\nParliament will always cleave to their party, as the bulk of electors do,\r\nand the dread of being thought singular is a potent influence on the\r\naverage man, in or out of Parliament. Democracy is in danger of losing the\r\ncounsel of its best men when it insists that its representatives must be\r\nmerely delegates of the electors, without minds or wills of their own; but\r\nit is in greater danger if it allows its representatives to be nothing but\r\nthe tools of the party in power or in opposition. For when Parliamentary\r\nrepresentation is confined to those who are willing to be the mechanical\r\nimplements of party leaders and managers, the House of Commons becomes an\r\nassembly of place-hunters and self-seekers, for whom the profession of\r\npolitics affords the gratification of vanity or enrichment at the public\r\nexpense. In such an assembly the self-respecting man with a laudable\r\nwillingness to serve the State is conspicuous by his absence.\r\n\r\nWith a Press in the hands of party politicians, and with editors and\r\njournalists engaged to write up their party through thick and thin, and to\r\nwrite down every honest effort at political independence of mind, the\r\ndanger of losing from all political service the few rare minds that can ill\r\nbe spared is a very real and present danger.\r\n\r\nON BEHALF OF DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\"The price of liberty is eternal vigilance,\" and often enough we sleep at\r\nour vigils. But when all the dangers and difficulties that beset democracy\r\nare enumerated, and all its weak spots are laid bare, we can still hold\r\ndemocracy to be the only suitable form of government for persons possessing\r\nfree will, and the representation of the people the most satisfactory\r\nexpression of democracy.\r\n\r\nGovernment by autocrat, by despotism, benevolent or otherwise, by expert\r\nofficials, or by an oligarchy of superior intelligences is irksome to the\r\naverage man or woman of reasonable education, and in each case has been\r\nintolerable to the British people. They have all been tried and found\r\nwanting--royal absolutism, aristocracy, military dictatorship, and only of\r\nlate have we been threatened by an expert bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nParliamentary representation adapted, by the removal of disabilities of\r\ncreed and rank and income, to meet the demands of the nation, has been\r\nproved by experience a clumsy but useful weapon for checking oppression.\r\nNowadays, we are using it less for defence against oppression, or as an\r\ninstrument for removing political grievances, and are testing its worth for\r\nthe provision of positive social reform. More and more it is required of\r\nParliament that means be found for getting rid of the ills around us, for\r\npreventing disease and destitution, for promoting health and decency.\r\n\r\nAnd just because legislation is, at the prompting of a social conscience,\r\ninvading our homes and workshops, penetrating into prisons, workhouses, and\r\nhospitals, touching the lives of all of us from the cradle to the grave,\r\nthe more imperative is it that our legislators should be chosen freely by\r\nthe widest electorate of men and women. We fall back on the old maxim:\r\n\"That which touches all shall be approved by all,\" and can perceive no\r\nother way of obtaining that general approbation for the laws than by the\r\npopular election of our representatives.\r\n\r\nDemagogues may exploit the popular will, the cunning and unscrupulous in\r\npower may have us at their mercy, in our folly and indifference the nation\r\nmay be brought to grave losses; but still there is always the means of\r\nrecovery for the well-disposed while the vote remains in their hands.\r\n\r\nSo it is that, in spite of obvious failings and shortcomings, democracy by\r\nrepresentative government remains for nations throughout the world that\r\nhave not yet tried it the goal of their political striving. We are alive to\r\nthe imperfections of democracy. It is no automatic machine for conferring\r\nbenefits in return for taxes. It is the creation of mankind, not a\r\nrevelation from heaven; and it needs, like all good human things, constant\r\nattention and can bear many improvements. It has to be adjusted from time\r\nto time to suit the growing capacities of mankind--as the popular assembly\r\ngave way to the representative assembly--and only on the failure to make\r\nthe adjustment does it get rusty and out of order. It has to meet the\r\nrequirements of vast empires and mighty confederations of states, and to\r\nfulfil the wants of small republics and parish councils.\r\n\r\nWhat but democracy can answer to the call for political liberty that sounds\r\nfrom so many lands and in so many varying tongues? Did any other form of\r\ngovernment devised by the wit of man make such universal appeal?\r\n\r\nAnd when all is said and done--what does this democracy, this government by\r\npopular representatives, mean, but government by the consent of the\r\ngoverned--the only form of government tolerable to civilised mankind in the\r\ntwentieth century?\r\n\r\nGiven a fairly good standard of common honesty in the ordinary dealings of\r\nlife, and the honesty of our public life, whether in Parliament or in the\r\nCivil Service, in executive or administration, will serve. If the private\r\nand commercial life is corroded with dishonesty, then democracy will be\r\nbitten by knaves and rascals. For our chosen rulers have a way of\r\nfaithfully reflecting the morality of their electors, and are not free to\r\nindulge their fancies, as kings of old were.\r\n\r\nPolitics are not, and never will be, or ought to be, the chief interest and\r\nconcern of the mass of people in a healthy community where slavery is\r\nextinct. And democracy makes no demand that would involve such interest and\r\nconcern. The choice of honest representatives, persons of goodwill, and\r\nreasonable intelligence, is no tremendous task in a community where\r\nhonesty, goodwill, and intelligence prevail. And if these things do not\r\nprevail, if honesty is contemned in business, and goodwill between man and\r\nman despised, and intelligence frowned upon, then it is of small importance\r\nwhat the government of such a nation is, for that nation is doomed, and it\r\nis well for the world that it should be doomed.\r\n\r\nBut, on the whole, it seems indisputable that the common people of the\r\ngreat nations do cleave to honesty and goodwill, and that the desire for\r\nintelligence is being widely fostered. As long, then, as we can count on\r\nhonesty, goodwill, and intelligence in our streets and market-places, as we\r\ncan to-day, mankind does well to elect its representatives to council and\r\nParliament and proclaim democracy--\"Government of the people, by the\r\npeople, for the people\"--as the proper government for mankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes.\r\n\r\n[1] We cannot be sure about the constitution of the Witenagemot.

It was left for the 'glorious Revolution' of 1688, and for\r\nthe Hanoverian dynasty, to develop the ingenious system of adjustments and\r\ncompromises which is now known, sometimes as cabinet government, sometimes\r\nas parliamentary government.\"--ILBERT, _Parliament_.\r\n\r\n[67] G.P. Gooch, _Annals of Politics and Culture_.\r\n\r\n[68] Palmerston's influence in the House of Commons was about as bad in the\r\nnineteenth century.--_See_ BAGEHOT, _The English Constitution_.\r\n\r\n[69] \"Here and there we find an eminent man, whose public services were so\r\nnotorious that it was impossible to avoid rewarding them; but putting aside\r\nthose who were in a manner forced upon the Sovereign, it would be idle to\r\ndeny that the remainder and, of course, the overwhelming majority, were\r\nmarked by a narrowness and illiberality of sentiment, which, more than\r\nanything else, brought the whole order into contempt. No great thinkers, no\r\ngreat writers, no great orators, no great statesman, none of the true\r\nnobility of the land, were to be found among those spurious nobles created\r\nby George III. Nor were the material interests of the country better\r\nrepresented. Among the most important men in England those engaged in\r\nbanking and commerce held a high place; since the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury their influence had rapidly increased.... But in the reign of\r\nGeorge III. claims of this sort were little heeded.\"--BUCKLE, _History of\r\nCivilisation_.\r\n\r\n[70] \"They, the friars, and especially the Franciscans, largely influenced\r\npolitics. The conception of individual freedom, upon which the life of St.\r\nFrancis was built, went far to instil the idea of civic freedom into men's\r\nminds.... It was the ideas of the friars that found expression in the\r\nBaron's War.\" The Song of the Battle of Lewes \"set forth unmistakably the\r\nconception of the official position of the King, and affirmed the right of\r\nhis subjects to remove evil counsellors from his neighbourhood, and to\r\nremind him of his duty--ideas due to the political influence of the\r\nFranciscans.\"--CREIGHTON, _Historical Lectures and Addresses_.\r\n\r\n[71] The late Lord Acton pointed out that St. Thomas Aquinas was really the\r\nfirst Whig.\r\n\r\n[72] See Introduction to Rousseau's _Social Contract_, by H. J. Tozer.\r\n\r\n[73] \"That which distinguishes the French Revolution from other political\r\nmovements is that it was directed by men who had adopted certain\r\nspeculative a priori conceptions with the fanaticism and proselytising\r\nfervour of a religious belief, and the Bible of their Creed was the\r\n_Contrat Social_ of Rousseau.\"--LECKY, _England in Eighteenth Century_,\r\nVol. V.\r\n\r\n\"The original contract seized on as a watchword by Rousseau's enthusiasm\r\ngrew from an arid fiction into a great and dangerous deceit of\r\nnations.\"--Sir F.

Gammage, _History of the Chartist Movement_.\r\n\r\n[80] \"The condition of the labouring classes was the least satisfactory\r\nfeature of English life in 1846. Politically they were dumb, for they had\r\nno parliamentary votes. Socially they were depressed, though their lot had\r\nbeen considerably improved by an increased demand for labour and by the\r\nremoval of taxes in Peel's great Budget of 1842. That was the year in which\r\nthe misery of the English proletariat reached its lowest depth.\"--HERBERT\r\nPAUL, _History of Modern England_.\r\n\r\n[81] Justin McCarthy, _Short History of Our Own Times_.\r\n\r\n[82] McCarthy, _Ibid_.\r\n\r\n[83] Tout, _England since 1689_.\r\n\r\n[84] \"For a general extension of the franchise, an extension from the\r\noccupation franchise to the adult franchise, there does not appear to be\r\nany demand, except in connection with the burning question of the franchise\r\nfor women.\"--ILBERT, _Parliament_.\r\n\r\n[85] \"On the mere numerical basis Ireland is much over-represented, but\r\nIreland claims to be treated as a separate entity, and her claims cannot be\r\ndisregarded.\"--ILBERT, _Parliament_.\r\n\r\n[86] Rt. Hon. A.J. Balfour, M.P., House of Commons, 1910.\r\n\r\n[87] \"With great tact, and without very much friction, he brought the\r\nmonarchy into touch with the state of things brought about by the Reform\r\nBill. He did for the Crown what Wellington did for the House of Lords. Just\r\nas the Duke saw that the Lords must give up setting themselves against the\r\nnational will strongly expressed, so did the Prince see that the Crown\r\ncould no longer exercise those _legal_ rights for which George III. had\r\nfought so manfully. Like the Lords, the Crown now became a checking and\r\nregulating, rather than a moving, force. It remained as the pledge and\r\nsymbol of the unity and continuity of the national life, and could do good\r\nwork in tempering the evils of absolute party government. Such of the royal\r\n_prerogatives_ as were not dead must be carried out by ministers. The royal\r\n_influence_ continued to run through every branch of the State.\"--Professor\r\nT.F. TOUT, _England from 1689._\r\n\r\n[88] Mr. J.M. Robertson, M.P., _Charles Bradlaugh--A Record of His Life and\r\nWork_.\r\n\r\n[89] F. York Powell, _Thoughts on Democracy_.\r\n\r\n[90] Unfortunately the present House of Commons has just decided, August,\r\n1911, to pay its members a salary of £400 a year from the national revenue.\r\nIt is to be regretted that the cost has not been laid directly on the\r\nelectors, and that the time is not more appropriate. With the country torn\r\nwith strikes of workmen seeking a few extra shillings a week, it was hardly\r\nthe opportune moment for a House of Commons to vote itself some £250,000 a\r\nyear. The proposal would have been more palatable to the nation if the\r\nCommons had decided that payment should begin with the _next_ Parliament.",
