None has\r\nbetter claim to it than Mme. Adam, _La Grande Française_, as she has\r\nbeen happily called, the story of whose life, which is now running\r\ninto its eighty-first year, is told in the following pages.\r\n\r\nTo write Mme. Adam’s biography is also to write one of the most\r\nmomentous chapters of French history. For this remarkable woman has\r\nlived through the Revolution of 1848, the _coup d’état_ of 1851, the\r\nagony of the siege of Paris, the civil war of the Commune, and two\r\ninvasions of her beloved _patrie_.\r\n\r\nAs the mistress of a leading political salon, as the founder and\r\neditor for twenty years of an influential fortnightly magazine, _La\r\nNouvelle Revue_, as for many years the intimate friend of Gambetta, of\r\nThiers, of other French ministers, of the representatives of foreign\r\npowers and of such eminent French writers as George Sand, Flaubert,\r\nVictor Hugo, Alphonse Daudet, Pierre Loti, Paul Bourget and Maurice\r\nBarrès, she has not only kept her finger on the pulse of her great\r\nnation, but she has to some extent modulated its heart-beats.\r\n\r\nThe key to Mme. Adam’s temperament and to all the varied phases of\r\nher career is her passionate belief in self-government, in that cause\r\nof national independence for which the powers of L’Entente are now\r\nengaging in this world-embracing conflict. We may call it a belief,\r\nbut originally in Mme. Adam’s case it was an instinct born in her and\r\ninherited from her father, one of the most ardent of revolutionaries.\r\nMme. Adam is a _revoltée_ to the core. _Toujours hors des rangs_,\r\nGambetta said of her. In numerous incidents of her childhood\r\nher rebelliousness revealed itself. The growth of her reasoning\r\npowers, however, led her to submit to discipline, to embrace with\r\nfervour—she can never do anything by halves—the republican creed, and\r\nto become the irreconcilable adversary of the Second Empire. Then\r\nthe national defeat of 1871, acting upon what she has described as\r\nher _combativité rentrée_ (her suppressed combativeness), turned her\r\npassion for self-government into an ardent advocacy of the principle\r\nof nationality, into a vehement protest against everything which could\r\nin even the remotest manner be suspected of undermining that principle.\r\n\r\nConsequently we shall find Mme. Adam loudly lifting up her voice,\r\nvigorously wielding her pen most frequently against Prussian\r\naggressiveness, but also against imperialistic ideas, no matter in\r\nwhat shape or form, no matter in what part of the world she can detect\r\nthem. We shall find her opposing alike the French tendency to colonial\r\nexpansion and the Austrian _Drang nach Osten_, Mr. Gladstone’s later\r\npolicy in Egypt and the Conservative coercion of Ireland, the Magyar\r\ndomination over the Slav peoples and our war with the Boer Republic in\r\nSouth Africa. We shall find her also ever glorifying the army and navy\r\nas the most effective guarantee of national independence.\r\n\r\nNationalism is Mme. Adam’s creed, patriotism her religion. French\r\nNationalists, like Léon Daudet, regard her as having been the strong\r\ntower of the French idea (_la forteresse de l’idée française_)\r\nthroughout the forty-four years separating the war of 1914 from the\r\nwar of 1870. If in later years Mme. Adam has renounced her father’s\r\nagnosticism and returned to the bosom of the Church, it is primarily\r\nbecause she considers that only by submitting to the Roman obedience\r\ncan she best continue the traditions of her country.\r\n\r\nI am very fortunate, for Mme. Adam has throughout taken a deep\r\ninterest in this biography. We have discussed it together at length.\r\nDespite her multifarious war activities she has found time to write\r\nme some forty letters in response to my questions. She has also\r\nintroduced me to her friend and collaborator in _La Nouvelle Revue_,\r\nMme. Jeanne Krompholtz, who has kindly furnished me with valuable\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nFor the greater part of Mme. Adam’s life, however, from her birth in\r\n1836 down to 1880, my main authority has been her seven volumes of\r\n_Souvenirs_. These living documents, written, many of them, under\r\nthe immediate impression of the events they record, I have carefully\r\ncompared with contemporary and more recent writings, indicated by\r\nfoot-notes throughout these pages. For the quarter of a century and\r\nmore which has elapsed since the close of Mme. Adam’s _Souvenirs_\r\nI have consulted her numerous other autobiographical works, her\r\ncontributions to _La Nouvelle Revue_ and to other periodical\r\nliterature, and also the frequent references to her personally, and to\r\nher books, which have appeared from time to time in the French press\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI have to thank Sir Sidney Colvin, who frequently visited Mme. Adam at\r\nher salon’s most brilliant moment, in the seventies, for generously\r\nbringing forth from the rich treasure-house of his remembrance and for\r\npermitting me to incorporate in this book valuable recollections which\r\nenhance, confirm and complement impressions derived from other sources.\r\n\r\nHad he lived to see this work completed I should have gladly taken\r\nthis opportunity to thank another of Mme. Adam’s acquaintances and\r\nadmirers, M. Elie Mercadier, Director in London of L’Agence Havas. For\r\nto his lively talk about _La Grande Française_ and her circle I am\r\nindebted for many a striking trait and useful suggestion.\r\n\r\n                                        WINIFRED STEPHENS.\r\n\r\n  _London, 1917._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] “_Celui qui l’a baptisée ‛la Grande Française’ a bien dit._”—Léon\r\nDaudet, _L’Entre-Deux-Guerres_, 231 (1915).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

Adam, Souvenirs._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the opening pages of her _Recollections_ Mme. Adam has told,\r\nwith more vivid detail than is unhappily here possible, the story\r\nof two generations of her ancestors. Her own career has not lacked\r\nromance; but many of its most thrilling incidents pale beside the\r\nexperiences of her forbears. Tracing them back to the Napoleonic Wars,\r\nshe presents us with a lively picture of domestic history, which\r\nis as far from being commonplace as it is possible to imagine. For\r\nit embraces moving scenes of rapturous love affairs, extraordinary\r\nmarriages, a startling infidelity, quarrels about dowries, and the\r\nstory of a son who had a rare precocious experience. At the age of\r\nnine, he found himself already disinherited and sent forth in the\r\nworld, cast upon the mercy of the family milkman, with whom he took\r\nrefuge. This juvenile outcast was Mme. Adam’s maternal grandfather,\r\nof whom, under the name of Dr. Seron, we shall hear much more anon.\r\nOnly by unwavering persistence, and stern resolution did this unhappy\r\nboy escape from his benefactor’s vocation. Tramping to Paris,\r\nboots in hand, to save shoe-leather, he educated himself into the\r\nmedical profession and ultimately married Mme. Adam’s grandmother,\r\nPélagie Raincourt. Pélagie also was a highly romantic person, no\r\nless remarkable than her husband. For on her wedding morning, as the\r\nresult of a family broil, by no means rare among Mme. Adam’s forbears,\r\nshe escaped in a pet from her mother’s house, and was found sitting\r\nby the roadside, clad only in a nightcap and dressing-gown, by her\r\nbridegroom, who had pursued her on horseback. Swinging her into the\r\nsaddle, in order to avoid further escapades, he carried her off to the\r\nchurch and there married her out of hand. Her sole bridal adornment\r\nwas a white carnation, which a woman of the people pinned into her cap.\r\n\r\nJuliette in later years was shown the cap and the carnation to\r\nillustrate the story, which she heard from the runaway’s own lips.\r\n\r\nMme. Seron continued all her life addicted to romance. When it became\r\na question of marrying her daughter, Olympe, Mme. Adam’s mother, Mme.\r\nSeron, a catholic, chose a son-in-law who was an agnostic, because she\r\nwas attracted by his appearance and his history. Jean Louis Lambert,\r\nMme. Adam’s father, had for the sake of his opinions sacrificed\r\nbrilliant ecclesiastical prospects, and from the prospective secretary\r\nof the Archbishop of Beauvais had become an usher in the boys’\r\nschool opposite Mme. Seron’s house. This heroic youth was taken by\r\nMme. Adam’s grandmother, educated as a doctor, and married to the\r\nreluctantly quiescent Olympe, who from that time forward adopted that\r\nattitude of injured passivity which was expressed by her favourite\r\nphrase “where you have tethered the goat there it will graze.”\r\n\r\nAll this happened in Picardy, a province where people lived well and\r\nwashed sparingly. The very name of Mme. Adam’s birthplace, Verberie,\r\nwith its suggestion of oyster patties and sauterne, made Robert Louis\r\nStevenson’s mouth water, as he paddled towards it in his canoe.\r\nJuliette remembers how on Fridays at ten in the morning the oyster\r\ncart from Boulogne would arrive, bringing twelve dozen oysters for\r\nher family, how they would all sit round the table, the oyster barrel\r\nin the centre, and how each with his or her knife would open his or\r\nher oysters. Juliette’s grandfather and father would consume four\r\ndozen each, her grandmother and mother two dozen each, while sometimes\r\nthere would be a friend who would abstract as many as possible from\r\nhis hosts’ respective shares. Wine flowed freely at these feasts. Dr.\r\nSeron was a twelve-bottle man. But fortunately his beverage was only\r\nlight Macon; and this, happily for his patients, was not consumed\r\nuntil he had performed his operations at the hospital. Operations!\r\nOne trembles at the very word when associated with Dr. Seron. For,\r\naccording to his granddaughter, that country surgeon was a most\r\ndiligent cultivator of microbes. Ablutions, as we have said, were rare\r\nin Picard households. A bath was unheard of. Dr. Seron held that the\r\nface should be washed as little as possible for fear of bringing out a\r\nrash. Soap was only used on Sundays. The windows, of course, were kept\r\ntightly shut. Physical exercise was carefully avoided. The women of\r\nMme. Adam’s family, like old-fashioned Frenchwomen down to the present\r\nday, seldom went beyond their own house and garden, declining even the\r\nattractions of the provincial theatre, for they agreed with Mme. de\r\nSévigné that _une grande dame ne doit pas remuer les os_ (a true lady\r\nshould not move about her bones).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though their bodies were cribbed, cabined and confined,\r\nthese Frenchwomen’s minds moved in the great world of romance, their\r\nfancies glowed with all the fervent imaginings of that effervescent\r\nage. Mme. Adam’s grandmother lived, moved and had her being in the\r\n“Human Comedy” of Balzac. Turning over the pages of his ninety-seven\r\nnovels, or sitting over her embroidery frame, she lived the lives of\r\nhis five thousand characters. Her unfortunate choice of a husband for\r\nher granddaughter, Juliette, was largely dictated by the suitor’s\r\nresemblance to one of her favourite novelist’s heroes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMme. Adam, as we have said, was born at the little Picard town\r\nof Verberie, a famous place in mediæval times, the residence of\r\nFrankish kings, whither in the ninth century had come Ethelbald,\r\nKing of Wessex, to wed his thirteen-year-old bride, Charles the\r\nBald’s daughter, Judith. Verberie in the last century was a favourite\r\nplace of call for tourists, who in pre-motor-car days used to drive\r\nleisurely from Senlis to Compiègne. Our English poetess, Mary Robinson\r\n(Mme. Duclaux)[2], tells how from the steep brow of a down, known as\r\n“la Montagne de Verberie,” she saw through “the poplar screens of the\r\nprecipitous hill-side, a lovely blue expanse of country with the Oise\r\nlying across it like a scimitar of silver”; how her carriage dashed\r\ndown the hill “and clattered along the sleepy, pebbly ... street, past\r\nthe inn, full of blouses and billiards.”\r\n\r\nIt was in that very inn, “Les Trois Monarques,” at Verberie that Mme.\r\nAdam was born, at half-past five on the 4th of October, 1836.\r\n\r\nWas it a glimpse into their daughter’s future that made her parents\r\nname her “Juliette” after that most seductive of all the queens of\r\nFrench salons, Mme. Récamier?\r\n\r\nNo gold or even silver spoon was in our Juliette’s mouth when she made\r\nher first appearance on this world’s stage. At the time of her birth,\r\nher parents’ fortunes had reached a low ebb. Dr. Lambert had been in\r\npractice with his great-uncle in a village not far from Verberie,\r\nand thither to his uncle’s house he had brought home his girl wife.\r\nFor the first years of their marriage everything had gone well with\r\nthe young couple. Then had come a deluge of misfortunes. Their first\r\nbaby, a boy, died in convulsions. Then the uncle died, and his estate\r\nwas divided among numerous legatees. Finally, a fire broke out which\r\nnearly consumed the whole village, and, despite Mme. Lambert’s heroic\r\nefforts, burned her husband’s house to the ground.\r\n\r\nThus were Juliette’s parents driven to seek harbourage in the inn at\r\nVerberie, where Juliette was born.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after this event, her father, one of the most unpractical\r\nbut at the same time most attractive of scientists, was fascinated by\r\nthe report of some marvellous scientific experiments, which were being\r\nmade in the neighbouring town of Compiègne, by a well-known chemist,\r\na Dr. Bernhardt. Leaving his wife and daughter to the tender mercies\r\nof mine host of “The Three Monarchs,” Dr. Lambert went off to join\r\nhis _confrère_. This Dr. Bernhardt came to be regarded by Juliette’s\r\nfamily as a veritable German Mephistopheles; for the only result of\r\nhis experiments was the consumption of Mme. Lambert’s dowry.\r\n\r\nDuring her husband’s scientific adventures Mme. Lambert and her baby\r\ngirl in the Verberie inn were suffering serious privations. And they\r\nmight have come near starvation had it not been for the assistance\r\nthey received from Mme. Lambert’s parents. But this timely aid could\r\nonly be given surreptitiously; for Juliette had had the misfortune\r\nto be born, not into poverty merely, but into one of the numerous\r\nfamily feuds which were to chequer all her childhood. Between her\r\nparents and her grandparents at the time of the first baby’s death\r\nthere had arisen a misunderstanding. For some time there had been\r\nno communication between the Lamberts at Verberie and the Serons,\r\nwho lived not far away at Chauny, then a flourishing manufacturing\r\ntown, now converted by German vandalism into a heap of ruins. It was\r\nonly by the curtest of notes that Dr. Lambert had announced to Dr.\r\nand Mme. Seron their granddaughter’s advent. Had it not been for the\r\nreport, brought by one of Dr. Seron’s patients, a friendly commercial\r\ntraveller, Juliette’s grandmother would never have known of the sorry\r\nplight to which her son-in-law’s scientific vagaries had reduced his\r\nwife and child.\r\n\r\nOn hearing the commercial traveller’s news, Mme. Seron, with\r\ncharacteristic impetuousness, flew into a passion and declared that\r\nshe would set off at once for Verberie to rescue her granddaughter\r\nfrom the parents who were obviously incapable of taking care of her.\r\nDr. Seron, however, succeeded in convincing his wife that a family\r\nscene would be injurious for the infant, whom her mother was nursing.\r\nHe reminded Mme. Seron that the first Lambert baby had died in\r\nconvulsions; and finally he induced her to postpone her intervention\r\nuntil the child was nine months old and might leave her mother without\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the landlord of “The Three Monarchs” was secretly given to\r\nunderstand that Mme. and Mlle. Lambert must be made comfortable, and\r\nthat Dr. Seron might be held responsible for the reckoning.\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty during those interminable nine months did the\r\nardent grandmother possess her soul in patience. She occupied the\r\ntime, however, in working out the details of the cleverly devised plot\r\nby which she ultimately succeeded in carrying off her grandchild.\r\n\r\nJuliette in after years used to delight to hear her grandmother\r\ndescribe all the stages of that famous _coup_: how the landlord of\r\nthe inn was made privy to the plot; how there stood ready a coach,\r\nnothing less than a _berline_, recalling another flight, more famous\r\nbut less successful; how in the coach had been placed a warm shawl and\r\na bottle of hot milk; how, while Mme. Lambert was haggling over the\r\nbill with the landlord, Mme. Seron, bearing a certain precious bundle,\r\nwas stealthily stealing to the _berline_ and then speeding away with\r\nbaby Juliette to join the diligence outside the town; how ultimately\r\nthe stolen jewel was deposited safely at Chauny, whither not long\r\nafterwards her mother followed her.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Dr. Lambert, penniless and disillusioned, plead for the\r\nreturn of his wife and daughter. “Not until you have proved yourself\r\nable to support them,” was Mme. Seron’s stern reply; and, she added\r\nrelentlessly, “I adopt the child whom you abandoned, whom you left a\r\nprey to the direst poverty. She is mine, and shall be as long as I\r\nlive.”\r\n\r\nThus ended the first of those kidnappings which were to recur at\r\nintervals through the first sixteen years of Juliette’s life, until\r\nher first marriage. They arose not merely from the rival claims of\r\nparents and grandparents to possess the child, but from the fact that\r\neach of these four persons held pronounced and divergent opinions as\r\nto the upbringing of their adored one. In the quarrels which ensued,\r\nMme. Seron and Dr. Lambert were the protagonists; Dr. Seron and Mme.\r\nLambert played the parts of supers, or supported one side or the other.\r\n\r\nWe are all, even the most obstinate and strong-minded, moulded, though\r\noften unconsciously, by various intellectual influences. To this rule\r\nJuliette, despite her indomitable will and personal idiosyncrasy,\r\nwas no exception. And a study of her mental development shows her\r\npassing through three distinct phases: her childhood and youth, when\r\nher grandmother’s or her father’s influence dominated alternately:\r\nmiddle life, when broadly speaking she sympathised with her father’s\r\nopinions: her later years, after the war of 1870, when more or less\r\nshe was returning to her grandmother’s point of view.\r\n\r\nWith these two formative forces, with these two remarkable persons,\r\nMme. Seron and her son-in-law, Dr. Lambert, we must become intimately\r\nacquainted if we would understand Juliette’s character and career.\r\nWe must also remember that the time of Juliette’s upbringing was\r\nthe hey-day of the romantic period, a time when individualism ran\r\nrampant, when the most Utopian of dreamers believed they were about\r\nto realise their wildest hopes. It was true that after half a century\r\nof experiments in government France had practically settled down for\r\na while into the jog-trot of Louis Philippe’s reign. But beneath the\r\nveil of the moderate and the commonplace which this compromise of\r\nconstitutional monarchy had cast over the country, there bubbled and\r\nboiled a welter of effervescence which twelve years after Juliette’s\r\nbirth exploded in the Revolution of 1848.\r\n\r\nThe national temperament of France during the first half of the last\r\ncentury partly accounts for the temperament of Juliette’s family,\r\nand for the atmosphere of intellectual and emotional feverishness in\r\nwhich she was brought up. Looking back from the vantage point of old\r\nage on the stormy scenes of her childhood, she asked: “Were we more\r\nsensitive then, more susceptible, more dramatic than to-day? I believe\r\nwe were.”[3] It is not improbable also that Mme. Adam, regarding her\r\nchildhood through the long vista of years, may have unconsciously\r\nexaggerated the violence of her sentiments and experiences. One of\r\nher charms is that feeling for the dramatic, with which Gambetta once\r\nreproached her, saying, “_Vous dramatisez trop, madame!_”\r\n\r\n“My love for my grandmother and for my daughter,” said Mme. Adam to\r\nme shortly before her eightieth birthday, “have been the two great\r\npassions of my life.”\r\n\r\nOf her grandmother, she announces in the beginning of her _Souvenirs_:\r\n“I shall write of her often, but shall I ever ... be able to make her\r\nlive with that originality, that passion for the romantic which she\r\ninfused into us all, lifting on to the plane of high romance the whole\r\nof our family life and each one of our daily actions?”\r\n\r\nThough Mme. Seron hardly ever went outside her own domestic domain\r\nexcept to attend mass on Sunday, her granddaughter could say that\r\nnever had she met a mind “more avid of adventure, more scornful of the\r\nevery-day and the commonplace, more eager for the romantic in life and\r\nin literature.”\r\n\r\nIn no point, save in their passionate adoration of Juliette, did\r\nMme. Seron and her son-in-law agree. Yet in temperament they were\r\nnot altogether unlike; for they were both dreamers. But Juliette’s\r\ngrandmother, if she did not possess it, at least respected that\r\nworldly wisdom which Dr. Lambert regarded with the utmost contempt.\r\nHe was an idealist pure and simple. We have seen him sacrificing a\r\nbrilliant ecclesiastical career to conscientious scruples. We have\r\nseen him risking the happiness of his wife and child in his pursuit of\r\nscience. We shall see him again, more than once risking not only his\r\nfamily’s happiness but his own life in the cause of political reform.\r\n\r\n“I am the daughter,” writes Mme. Adam, “of a sincere sectary ... of\r\none who dreamed of absolute liberty, absolute equality.... Only for a\r\nmoment, during the Commune, did he believe his dream realised.”\r\n\r\nJean Louis Lambert was one of those rare persons with tastes both\r\nscientific and literary. But it was only classical literature that\r\nappealed to him. He was a passionate Grecian and an ardent admirer\r\nof the French masterpieces of _le grand siècle_. In the remarkable\r\nliterary works which his own day was producing, in the novels of\r\nBalzac and George Sand, which were his mother-in-law’s meat and drink,\r\nhe took not the slightest interest. His Homer, on the other hand, he\r\nalmost knew by heart; and he made his little daughter as familiar with\r\ntales from the _Iliad_ as are most children with “Red Riding Hood” or\r\n“Cinderella.” Dr. Lambert himself wrote verses in the classic style,\r\nwhich he would recite to his mother-in-law; but there were others\r\nwhich were red republican, and which he would have kept from her\r\nhearing had not that _enfant terrible_ of a Juliette caught them up\r\nand repeated them parrot-like to her grandparents. Dr. Seron, an old\r\nsoldier of _la grande armée_, was infuriated by poems in which his\r\nson-in-law dared to attack his idol, the Emperor.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the family tendency to wrangle was considerably accentuated by\r\nthe fact that three of its members (Juliette’s mother took no interest\r\nin public affairs) held directly divergent political opinions. Mme.\r\nSeron was a liberal monarchist, Dr. Seron a Buonapartist, and Dr.\r\nLambert a social democrat. None of these fervent partisans had the\r\nremotest idea of keeping their opinions to themselves. Consequently,\r\nwhenever Dr. Lambert and his wife drove over from Blérancourt, a\r\nvillage nine miles from Chauny, where Juliette’s father had set up in\r\npractice, the voice of controversy rose high. These debates generally\r\noccurred at meal time. And baby Juliette, accustomed to have the\r\nattention of her doting elders fixed upon herself, strongly objected\r\nto these diversions. She tells how to restore herself to the limelight\r\nshe would clamber into the middle of the table and begin to upset the\r\nplates and glasses. The device never failed. Discussion ceased; the\r\nthree controversialists would be overcome with laughter, while the\r\nsilent member of the group, Juliette’s mother, would suddenly become\r\nactive. Snatching her daughter from the wreck on the table, she would\r\nbe administering a sound smacking when three pairs of hands would be\r\neagerly outstretched to rescue the culprit. Thus Juliette learnt\r\ntwo lessons: first, not to fear her mother’s severity, from which\r\nshe might always count upon the indulgence of her other relatives\r\nto deliver her; second, to appreciate “that first born of common\r\nsense,” the comic spirit. In her earliest years it was her inestimable\r\nprivilege to have “laughter for nurse, pure fun for friend.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Meredith, it will be remembered, divides humanity[4] into three\r\nclasses: the non-laughers, the excessive laughers and those who stand\r\nwhere the comic spirit places them, “at middle distance between the\r\ninveterate opponents and the drum and fife supporters of comedy.”\r\n\r\nIn the table scene just described, each of these three classes is\r\nrepresented. Juliette’s mother was a non-laugher, a morbid person\r\nwhose lack of fun, as is inevitable with women, degraded her to\r\nbe a mere household drudge. Juliette’s grandfather, the jovial\r\ndoctor, whose funny stories, nicknamed _Seronnades_, enlivened the\r\ncountryside, was of the drum and fife order, an apostle of _le gros\r\nrire_. Juliette’s grandmother and father, though differing in so many\r\nrespects, were alike endowed with the true comic spirit. Long years\r\nlater, looking back on her turbulent childhood, Mme. Adam wrote: “I\r\nshould probably have been intolerable, had not the gay and merry\r\ntemperaments of my grandparents ... introduced into our relationship\r\na jocular spirit which did not admit of solemnity, even in our\r\ngrievances. Whenever I succeeded in reconciling them after one of\r\ntheir disputes, it was because I had made them laugh.”[5] “Certainly,”\r\nexclaimed a character in one of Pierre Mille’s stories, “he was no\r\nLatin, for he took everything seriously.”[6] Juliette Adam, Gallic by\r\nbirth, Græco-Latin by education, as she likes to describe herself,\r\nhas always been ready to see a joke, even when it was at her own\r\nexpense. Thus she is proud to relate, how when at one of George Sand’s\r\ndinner-parties, Flaubert, in Dumas’ presence, pointed out that in one\r\nof her books she had made a man who had lost an arm take a box in both\r\nhands, she joined in the laugh, saying gaily, “_Merci, Maître_.”[7]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] _Fields of France_, 163.\r\n\r\n[3] _Souvenirs_, I. 350.\r\n\r\n[4] _An Essay on Comedy, and the uses of the Comedy Spirit._ 62, 1903.\r\n\r\n[5] _Souvenirs_, I. 127.\r\n\r\n[6] _Le Monarque_, 169.\r\n\r\n[7] _Souvenirs_, III. 163.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCHILDHOOD\r\n\r\n1839-1848\r\n\r\n     “_De l’amour et de l’indignation furent les aliments dont on\r\n     nourrit notre jeune cœur._”—Juliette Adam, Preface to her\r\n     _Souvenirs_, I. v.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite his intense desire to have his adored child in his own home,\r\nDr. Lambert constrained himself to permit Juliette to remain with\r\nher grandparents until she was three. But on his daughter’s fourth\r\nanniversary her father put in his paternal claim.\r\n\r\nLooking back over more than three score years and ten Mme. Adam still\r\nsees that day as the first which stands out clearly in her memory. She\r\nremembers it for several reasons—because of the new white frock she\r\nwore, embroidered by her grandmother; because the _bonne_ Arthémise\r\non that day called her “Mademoiselle” for the first time; because\r\nher grown-up friend Charles, professor at the boys’ school opposite,\r\nembraced her; because when her parents arrived late as usual from\r\nBlérancourt, on account of the bad roads, her father took her up in\r\nhis arms, kissed her, and with tears in his eyes said, “Juliette, how\r\nyou have grown, it is so long since I have seen you—three months.”\r\n\r\nBut above all that day stands engraved on Juliette’s recollection\r\nbecause in the midst of the birthday feast, there fell like a\r\nbombshell descending on the hitherto harmonious family party, her\r\nfather’s words: “This time we shall take Juliette home with us.”\r\nThen there ensued one of those impassioned family scenes which were\r\nso frequent in Juliette’s childhood. Mme. Seron refused to give up\r\nher granddaughter, Dr. Lambert protested vehemently that he would\r\nhave his child. The little girl, hardly out of babyhood, was herself\r\nappealed to: whom did she love most—her parents or her grandparents?\r\nWhere would she like to live—at Chauny or at Blérancourt? But in the\r\nend Mme. Seron won the day, as she usually did, and probably for the\r\nexcellent reason that it was she who held the family purse-strings.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, in this vehement, romantic, impulsive lady a\r\nstrain of consistency and logic. Because during that dinner-table\r\nwrangle with her son-in-law she had based her claim to Juliette’s\r\nremaining with her on the fact that there were better educational\r\nfacilities at Chauny than at Blérancourt, she felt compelled to act on\r\nthat assertion. Consequently, she lost no time in sending Juliette,\r\ntiny as she was, to school.\r\n\r\nBut this important crisis in Juliette’s career could not pass without\r\nyet another _drame de famille_. To send so young a child to the\r\n_pension_, to “prison,” as they called it, seemed to the easygoing Dr.\r\nSeron and to the _bonne_ Arthémise, who doted on her little charge,\r\nas nothing short of cruelty. Like a servant out of one of Molière’s\r\ncomedies, Arthémise rated her mistress soundly, whereupon she received\r\nan entirely disregarded notice to pack up her baggage and be off.\r\n\r\nOf this scene the little victim was herself a spectator. And it was as\r\na captive, therefore, that she regarded herself, when her grandmother\r\nled her off and delivered her up to her schoolmistress, the grim,\r\nmoustached Mme. Dufey, who, with what appeared to Juliette a veritable\r\nturnkey’s smile, received her with the announcement: “I had the\r\nmother, now I have the daughter.”\r\n\r\nThen followed a hurricane of a day. Cries, sobs and physical\r\nprotestations landed the new pupil in the school garret, wherefrom she\r\nwas extricated in the afternoon by Arthémise, who had come to take her\r\nhome. But home to her cruel grandmother this wilful child absolutely\r\nrefused to go. No sooner was she outside the school gates than she\r\nset off running in the direction of the village where Arthémise\r\nlived. There Arthémise weakly followed her. And it was only late in\r\nthe evening that the runaway, having been put to sleep in another and\r\npleasanter garret, was driven back to Chauny by her grandfather in his\r\ngig.\r\n\r\nJuliette felt that she had won a victory. Her grandmother had\r\ncertainly learnt a lesson. She now realised that her granddaughter\r\nwas the kind of child she herself had been—one of those who must be\r\nled and not driven. Henceforth Juliette was brought up on what we\r\nnow call the Montessori system. And the time came when she herself\r\nelected to go with one of her playmates to that same school, which she\r\nnow found quite amusing.\r\n\r\nIndeed, considering the strongly pronounced and utterly divergent\r\nopinions held as to her upbringing by the four persons who desired to\r\ncontrol her, the only possible course was for the child, as soon as\r\nshe was able, to train herself as far as possible.\r\n\r\nBut there were certain questions which even this head-strong little\r\ngirl found settled without her participation. There was notably\r\nthe religious question. Dr. Lambert, as we have seen, was a bitter\r\nanti-clerical, an aggressive agnostic of the old-fashioned Voltairean\r\nstamp. Mme. Lambert, Dr. and Mme. Seron were all catholics. And there\r\ngnawed at Mme. Lambert’s heart the painful secret that Juliette\r\nwas still a little heathen, for, as the result of her father’s\r\nanti-clericalism, she had never been baptized. To remedy this\r\nomission, without confessing it to her parents, Juliette’s mother\r\ndevised a clever and effectual stratagem. Under the pretext of being\r\npresent at the wedding of one of her mother’s friends, the little\r\ngirl was brought over to Blérancourt by her grandfather. Then at the\r\nend of the wedding ceremony, she was hurried into one corner of the\r\nchurch and held over what seemed to her a yawning gulf of a basin,\r\nwhere, amidst her violent protestations, she was transformed, as her\r\ngrandfather afterwards told her, from “a poor little unbaptized girl”\r\ninto “a big, happy baptized girl.” But this blessed conversion she was\r\ncarefully enjoined not to mention to her father, because he did not\r\nlike churches.\r\n\r\nWhether the youthful convert would have kept the secret is doubtful.\r\nBut the opportunity of doing so was reft from her by one of her\r\nplaymates, who during the wedding festivities called her, in her\r\nfather’s presence, by her baptismal names of “Camille Ambrosine.” This\r\nled to inquiries and to a disclosure, followed, of course, by the\r\ninevitable _drame de famille_. Fortunately for the conspirators an\r\naccident to one of Dr. Lambert’s patients put an end to this extremely\r\nunpleasant situation. And while the Blérancourt doctor was at the\r\ninjured man’s bedside his father-in-law seized the occasion to drive\r\nthe “little bone of contention” back to Chauny.\r\n\r\nJuliette, having been once captured by her catholic relatives, Dr.\r\nLambert agreed to surrender her mind to their keeping until she had\r\ntaken her first communion. And he must have been pleased that Mme.\r\nSeron, with her usual ambitious desire to force the pace in Juliette’s\r\neducation, persuaded the Dean to admit her clever little granddaughter\r\ninto the Church one year earlier than was customary, at ten instead of\r\neleven.\r\n\r\n“We must furnish the little brain,” was Mme. Seron’s favourite\r\nexpression. She herself had never acquired much book learning. But, in\r\norder to educate her grandchild, she for a while put on one side her\r\nadored novels and studied French history, of which she was most eager\r\nthat Juliette should take a correct view. That correct view was, of\r\ncourse, Mme. Seron’s own, and was the contradiction of her husband’s\r\nand son-in-law’s opinions. Juliette’s grandmother taught her to regard\r\nthe French middle-class, the _bourgeoisie_, as the salt of the earth,\r\nand the government of Louis Philippe as the only possible government,\r\ninfinitely superior to the Buonapartism which Dr. Seron and to the\r\nJacobinism which Dr. Lambert would have liked to restore.\r\n\r\nSo Juliette, surrounded by piles of lesson-books, was kept hard at\r\nwork till late in the evening, while her grandfather laughed at her\r\nfor being a blue-stocking, and dubbed her “Mlle. Phénomène.”\r\n\r\nBut even the jocular Dr. Seron could sometimes be serious: and he\r\ngravely warned his wife that if she continued thus to press the little\r\ngirl beyond her years misfortune would follow.\r\n\r\nHis warning being unheeded, the prognostication came true. Its\r\nfulfilment was hastened by three weeks at Blérancourt, where Dr.\r\nLambert talked to his little daughter as if she were grown up, and\r\nby a tempestuous journey home with her mother, followed by an even\r\nstormier _drame de famille_ on her arrival at Chauny.\r\n\r\nJuliette fell seriously ill. On her recovery, Dr. Seron, who seems to\r\nhave been the only member of the family endowed with common sense,\r\ninsisted on his granddaughter being removed from the atmosphere of\r\nschool-books and _drames de famille_ to a serener and healthier air.\r\n\r\nThe child was sent to visit her grandmother’s three step-sisters,\r\nthree maiden ladies who lived with their mother, in the heart of the\r\ncountry, at a village called Chivres, not far from Soissons.\r\n\r\n“My aunts! Ah! you must love my aunts!” exclaimed Mme. Adam, as one\r\nday, in the salon at Gif, we talked of these delectable virgins.\r\nAnd indeed one could not help loving the charming, though eccentric\r\nladies, _les demoiselles_ Sophie, Constance and Anastasie Raincourt.\r\nThey represent a type totally unknown in Great Britain, though I\r\nsuspect it might not at that time have been altogether impossible to\r\ndiscover their counterparts in other French country districts, or\r\nperhaps in remote corners of New England.\r\n\r\nThe aunts were a bundle of contradictions and surprises. In their\r\nshort gathered print skirts, aprons and kerchiefs, they looked like\r\npeasant women, and they worked like peasant women too, at hay-making,\r\npoultry-keeping and fruit-farming. But so distinguished was their\r\nbearing that in their humble attire they had the air of great ladies\r\nin disguise, while their discussion during hay-making of Sismondi’s\r\n_Italian Republics_ showed them to be veritable _femmes savantes_.\r\nThough living in the heart of the country, these original spinsters\r\ntook a deep interest in all the literary and political movements of\r\nthe town. Though, with their step-sister, Mme. Seron, they were firmly\r\nconvinced that a constitutional monarchy was the only ideal form of\r\ngovernment, they did not altogether share Mme. Seron’s admiration\r\nfor Louis Philippe. They criticised his policy and approved of the\r\nopposition led by M. Odillon Barot.\r\n\r\nIn almost every respect Juliette’s life at Chivres was a complete\r\ncontrast to her life at Chauny or Blérancourt. Instead of, as at\r\nChauny, sitting up late over her books and then going to bed in her\r\ngrandmother’s stuffy chamber, with the windows tightly closed and the\r\natmosphere infested by the midnight oil burnt to enable Mme. Seron to\r\nread her romances, Juliette at Chivres, after a day spent in healthy\r\nopen-air exercise, lay down with the lamb and rose with the lark,\r\nhaving slept by herself in a large airy room with the windows wide\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nWhereas at Chauny no interest was taken in house arrangement, while\r\npicturesque old family heirlooms were regarded as lumber and relegated\r\nto the attic, and any artistic feeling found its only expression in\r\npersonal adornment, at Chivres it was just the opposite: Juliette’s\r\nfine clothes were all folded away, and she was dressed like her\r\naunts in peasant costume; but her natural love of the beautiful\r\nwas gratified by the daintiness and artistry of all the household\r\narrangements, by the handsome old chests and commodes, the embroidered\r\ndraperies, the nosegays of fresh wild flowers, and the beautifully\r\nbound books ranged trimly on their shelves.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual atmosphere of Chivres was likewise entirely different\r\nfrom that of Chauny and Blérancourt. Dr. Lambert’s heroes, Louis Blanc\r\nand Proudhon, were anathema to such worshippers of the established\r\norder as the aunts. In the light of her aunts’ wide interest in all\r\nmanifestations of nature, her grandmother’s concentration on the\r\nmerely human aspect of life suddenly appeared to Juliette as intensely\r\nnarrow. It was at Chivres that Juliette first acquired that passionate\r\nlove of nature which she was later to express so eloquently in her\r\nbooks. It was at Chivres that Juliette learnt to take an interest in\r\nbirds and beasts and flowers, and also in inanimate things, to find—\r\n\r\n    “... tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,\r\n    Sermons in stones and good in everything.”\r\n\r\nIn her aunts’ company the simplest actions of rural life acquired\r\nfor the little girl some deep significance: watering flowers in the\r\ngarden she seemed to be quenching their thirst, gathering fruit in the\r\norchard she was easing the burden of overladen trees, cutting clover\r\nin the paddock she was receiving a gift from bountiful earth.\r\n\r\nFor Aunt Sophie even stones and metals had a voice or resonance. She\r\nwould place upon a crystal tray various substances differing in form,\r\nsome round, some flat, and with a little hammer would play upon them\r\ncurious melodies.\r\n\r\nWhile Juliette’s father had brought her up on tales from the _Iliad_,\r\nAunt Sophie, who was an accomplished Latin scholar, told her stories\r\nfrom the _Æneid_, which seemed to her strangely like an echo of her\r\nbeloved Homer. While her grandmother’s favourite novelist had been\r\nBalzac, the aunts talked to her admiringly of George Sand’s peasant\r\nromances, and vaguely hinted at longer novels by the same author,\r\nwhich they did not altogether like, but which Juliette would read when\r\nshe grew up.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest contrast of all was the atmosphere of calm which\r\npervaded Chivres, the harmony in which the aunts and their mother\r\nlived, so different from the perpetual wrangling of Chauny and\r\nBlérancourt. No wonder that Juliette after two months of this\r\nserenity returned to her grandmother a new creature, _in mens sana in\r\ncorpore sano_. No wonder that the perfect success of this first visit\r\ncaused it to be repeated annually throughout Juliette’s childhood.\r\nIndeed, as time went on, as Juliette grew in years, as the feverish\r\nintellectuality of Chauny and Blérancourt intensified, the summer\r\nvisit to Chivres became more and more necessary.\r\n\r\nHaving done his best to keep his word to his mother-in-law and to\r\npermit her to dominate Juliette’s mind until her first communion, once\r\nthat event was consummated Dr. Lambert felt at liberty to educate\r\nhis little girl in his own way, in his own ideas, and to make her,\r\nas he expressed it, “his daughter according to the spirit as well as\r\naccording to the flesh.”\r\n\r\nIn his earlier talks with Juliette he had endeavoured to impose\r\na certain reserve upon his expansive nature. Though finding it\r\nimpossible to exclude his beliefs, his hopes and enthusiasms\r\naltogether from their conversation, he had but alluded to them\r\nvaguely, saying, “when you are older I will explain to you such and\r\nsuch, when you are older you will understand this or that.”\r\n\r\nThis seed, though sown in an almost infantile mind, had not fallen on\r\nbarren ground. Not one of these remarks had been lost on Juliette’s\r\nprecocious and naturally speculative intelligence. She was therefore\r\nwell prepared to receive with enthusiasm those hopeful doctrines\r\nof liberty, fraternity and equality with which her father now set\r\nseriously to work to inculcate his eleven-year-old little daughter.\r\n\r\nOn Juliette’s return from Chivres in the autumn of 1847, she paid a\r\nvisit to her parents at Blérancourt. And it was then that her father\r\nsaid to her: “Now that you have discharged your obligations to your\r\ngrandmother’s religion, I can speak to you frankly of mine.”\r\n\r\nThe chief articles of Dr. Lambert’s creed were a belief in human\r\nsolidarity and a conviction in the inherent goodness of nature. With\r\nthe great Jean Jacques he held society, not nature, responsible for\r\nall the evils which have befallen mankind. His “great negation,” as\r\nhis daughter was later to call it, consisted in the denial that the\r\nfinite can ever be capable of comprehending the infinite. Nature, he\r\nheld, was rich enough and vast enough to satisfy all man’s craving for\r\nknowledge, sociability and love. “If you must worship something,” he\r\nwould say to Juliette, “then worship the sun which lightens and warms\r\nyou, in whose rays all things germinate, breathe and blossom.” While\r\nfor the Christian religion Dr. Lambert had little respect, its Founder\r\nhe held in the greatest veneration. While Christ came to obliterate\r\nall distinctions of race and caste, Christianity seemed to Juliette’s\r\nfather ever raising barriers between man and man. “Christ,” he used to\r\nsay, “came to save what he called ‛souls,’ we [the social democrats]\r\ncome to save society (_la personne sociale_) by establishing equality,\r\nfraternity, liberty.”\r\n\r\nIn days when trade unionism was beginning in Great Britain, and\r\nwhen Proudhon’s teaching was laying the foundations of future\r\nsyndicalism in France, Dr. Lambert was a firm believer in the right\r\nof all men to work, and to insist on receiving for that work a just\r\nwage. “Juliette,” he would say, “I rejoice to see you talking to\r\na working-man ... as if he were your brother. I want you to be an\r\napostle of human happiness and universal good. I love the weak and\r\nhelpless more than myself. To see struggle and suffering tortures me.\r\nTo those who have nothing one must give oneself up entirely, keeping\r\nnothing back.”\r\n\r\nAt such words the little girl’s heart glowed within her. With all\r\nher passionate little soul she responded to her father’s pity for\r\nthe unfortunate, with all the determination of her strong will she\r\nresolved to spend her life helping them.\r\n\r\nThough in years to come some of her father’s notions were to appear to\r\nher quixotic, though even then she and her grandmother laughed at his\r\naffecting the workman’s blouse, for example, though as time went on\r\nhis extravagance and lack of common sense were frequently to make her\r\ntremble for his safety, she never—not even when intellectually they\r\nhad drifted apart—ceased to reverence the breadth of his knowledge,\r\nthe range of his charity and his unfailing good nature. The words\r\n_apostle_ and _charity_ ever conjured up before her a vision of her\r\nfather. In spite of their perpetual disagreement, even Juliette’s\r\ngrandmother would say of her son-in-law: “He is a dreamer, but he is\r\nsincere, and he has a heart of gold.”\r\n\r\nDr. Lambert was indeed one of those intellectual enthusiasts who were\r\nlargely responsible for the Revolution of 1848. For these men of 1848\r\nMme. Adam has always cherished the most profound respect. Though\r\nin after life she came to regard them as childishly ingenuous and\r\nheedless of the possibility of realising their dreams, she has ever\r\nvenerated their “passionate altruism,” their “craving to sacrifice\r\nthemselves in the people’s cause,” their revolt against that famous\r\nformula ascribed to M. Guizot, “enrich yourselves.” “The men of 1848,”\r\nwrites Mme. Adam, “were apostles and saints. Never have there been\r\nmore honesty, more virtue, a nobler simplicity. They were no mere\r\npoliticians. They were souls in love with the ideal. All those whom\r\nI have known were as sincere as my father ... and to have associated\r\nwith them is to honour and cherish their memory.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHER FIRST REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n1848\r\n\r\n(_From a Schoolgirl’s Point of View_)\r\n\r\n     “_Les hommes de 1848 étaient des apôtres, des saints._”—Mme. Adam,\r\n     _Souvenirs_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMme. Adam has lived through four Revolutions. The first, that of 1848,\r\noccurred when she was eleven. In the previous year, when she paid her\r\nusual summer visit to Chivres, she found her aunts perturbed by the\r\npolitical situation. They were eagerly devouring the columns of the\r\n_National_. They were talking of politics from morn till night. Much\r\nto their mother’s disapproval, they brought their eleven-year-old\r\nniece into their discussions. “You are tiring the poor little thing to\r\ndeath!” remonstrated Juliette’s great-grandmother.\r\n\r\n“No,” rejoined her daughters, “the child is quite old enough to listen\r\nand to understand.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” continued Aunt Constance, who was the ironist of the three,\r\n“it will not be unprofitable to you, mademoiselle, to learn, if not\r\nwith your ears, at least with your mouth as you yawn, the views on\r\npublic affairs held by such highly intelligent persons as your aunts.”\r\n\r\n“But,” writes Juliette, “I did not yawn, for my mind was interested in\r\nall matters political and literary.”[8]\r\n\r\nFrom her aunts’ point of view the child saw those surging political\r\nmovements of the day at an angle quite different from that at which,\r\nunder her father’s direction, she had been accustomed to regard them.\r\n\r\nAt Chivres her father’s heroes, Louis Blanc, Ledru-Rollin, Proudhon,\r\nwere held in horror. As utterly subversive of all public order the\r\naunts regarded Ledru-Rollin’s famous speech, when, pleading before\r\nthe Court of Cassation, the republican barrister had challenged the\r\nProcureur Général, crying: “Procureur Général, who appointed you?”\r\n“The Ministry.” “I, being an elector, may dismiss ministries. In whose\r\nname do you speak?” “In the king’s name.” “I, being an elector—history\r\nproves it—can make and unmake kings. Procureur Général, on your knees,\r\non your knees before my sovereignty.” While as for Proudhon’s famous\r\nmaxim, “Property is theft,” the aunts exclaimed: “Why, it’s the end of\r\nthe world.” Social reform had no place in these good ladies’ political\r\nprogramme. They were content with the existing order. They had no\r\nsympathy with Dr. Lambert’s doctrine of the right to work, nor with\r\nLedru-Rollin when he declared: “The workers have been slaves; they\r\nhave been serfs; to-day they are wage-earners; we must strive to make\r\nthem partners.”[9] The reforms which the aunts advocated in their\r\ntalks with their niece were merely administrative. What they desired\r\nabove all was to see Paris dethroned from her seat as the one centre\r\nof influence in the kingdom. They wanted decentralisation, the revival\r\nof the old provincialism. “Remember,” said Aunt Sophie to Juliette,\r\n“a time will come, I am sure of it, when, after various Jacobin and\r\nBuonapartist experiments, after a series of revolutions, you will\r\nremember how wise, how essentially French, how truly national, were\r\nthe opinions of your old aunts.”[10]\r\n\r\nThe last months of 1847 Juliette was permitted to spend with her\r\nparents. Blérancourt in those days was becoming, under Dr. Lambert’s\r\ninfluence, a centre of violent political agitation. The number of Dr.\r\nLambert’s disciples was increasing daily, and his socialistic ideas\r\nwere being promulgated in the neighbouring villages. Mme. Seron wrote\r\nconstantly demanding her granddaughter’s return. She feared that from\r\nbeing a Republican, which was bad enough, Juliette would be made into\r\na socialist, converted from a pagan _naturiste_, as she called it,\r\ninto an atheist. Finally, such remonstrances passing unheeded, she\r\nthreatened that if her granddaughter were not immediately restored she\r\nwould disinherit her, and Juliette would be reduced to depend for her\r\ndowry on such savings as her father might accumulate. This practically\r\nmeant that Juliette would have no dowry at all. For Dr. Lambert, far\r\nfrom saving, could never keep any money in his pocket. In face of\r\npoverty and distress he was a veritable St. Martin of Tours, and would\r\ngive away the very clothes from his back. But to one whose mind was\r\nset so far above filthy lucre Mme. Seron’s threat was meaningless. And\r\nto his mother-in-law’s letter he replied that Juliette would not need\r\na dowry as he had decided to marry her to a working-man. But such a\r\ndestiny did not suit Mlle. Juliette at all. She had often dreamed of\r\na cottage, of a farm, but always with a gentleman (_un monsieur_) for\r\nhusband. And when her father told her of this letter, she exclaimed:\r\n“Of course you are joking.” “But no,” he replied; “that really is\r\nmy idea.” “Then it is not mine,”[11] retorted this eleven-year-old\r\nsocialist, to whom her father’s design seemed utterly preposterous and\r\ncruel to the last degree.\r\n\r\nTrue, she loved the people more and more every day. True, it seemed to\r\nher in moments of exaltation that she was ready to sacrifice herself\r\nin their service; but that she, whom generations had raised above\r\nthem, should become one of them, no. Father and daughter were equally\r\nviolent. This, their first disagreement, was, to say the least of it,\r\ntempestuous. And it was well that Mme. Seron arrived the next day to\r\ntake her granddaughter back to the less exalted atmosphere of Chauny.\r\n\r\nThough Dr. Lambert continued to cherish his dream of a working-class\r\nmarriage for Juliette, for the time being he ceased to urge its\r\nfulfilment; and for the time being Juliette found it not impossible to\r\nreconcile her socialism with filial devotion.\r\n\r\nAt Chauny she found that her grandmother’s political principles, like\r\nthose of the aunts at Chivres, had undergone a change. Mme. Seron\r\nhad lost her passion for the citizen king. She had come to realise\r\nthe necessity for reform. Juliette was delighted, and she expected\r\nher father to be equally pleased by his mother-in-law’s partial\r\nconversion. But she did not then know human nature. It was not until\r\nmuch later that she understood how a partisan is far more distrustful\r\nof opinions differing slightly from his own than of those which are\r\nmore remote. Dr. Lambert mistrusted a reform movement led by M.\r\nOdillon Barot as strongly as the aunts at Chivres mistrusted any\r\nreform advocated by that extreme liberal, M. Ledru-Rollin.\r\n\r\nJuliette’s schooling had been interrupted by her three months at\r\nChauny, and also by a visit to Boulogne, to which we shall refer\r\nlater, paid in company with her father in the summer of 1847.\r\n\r\nAfter Christmas she returned to the _pensionnat_. Many changes had\r\ntaken place in the school during the five years which had elapsed\r\nsince that eventful day when she made her _début_ as a scholar. The\r\nogress, Mme. Dufey, had been succeeded by two friends of Juliette’s\r\nmother, the Mlles. André. The school had expanded, and a new building\r\nhad been erected on the site, alas! of Mme. Seron’s garden, in which\r\nJuliette had spent some of her most entrancing hours. On the occasion\r\nof the destruction of this her land of delight, her “temple of\r\nverdure,” as she called it, there had been a long and violent battle\r\nbetween this little devotee of nature and her grandmother. The excuse\r\nthat the garden had been sold in order to provide Juliette with a\r\ndowry did not appeal to her in the least. Money had never loomed\r\nlarge in the child’s imagination. She loathed the mention of it; for\r\nit always seemed to her to lead to family quarrels. The only use she\r\nhad for it personally was for the purchase of sugar-drops, which she\r\ndistributed among her schoolfellows.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the little girl could be persuaded to enter the\r\nbuilding which seemed to her the grave of her brightest dreams and her\r\nmost cherished joys.\r\n\r\nNow, in the early weeks of 1848, Juliette found her school seething\r\nwith a political excitement, which she, with her violent views, was\r\nthe last person to allay.\r\n\r\nWith an important air the young politicians of the Pensionnat André\r\nwent about announcing “_l’heure des réformes a sonné_.” The playground\r\nechoed with cries of “Vive la Réforme!” “A bas Guizot!” The sympathies\r\nof the youthful reformers were entirely with the people, _le grand\r\npeuple_. They were transported into a veritable fury on the day when\r\nthey heard that “the people” had been massacred, the inoffensive\r\npeople, engaged in a manifestation strictly within the bounds of the\r\nlaw! Upon the heels of these tidings, however, followed quickly the\r\nnews that “the people” were revenged. Louis Philippe, after having\r\ntwice failed to form a ministry, the Duchess of Orléans, after a\r\nvain attempt to establish a regency, were in flight. “The people”\r\nhad raised barricades, “the people” had proclaimed the Republic.\r\n“The people,” read Juliette and her schoolfellows in the columns of\r\n_La Démocratie Pacifique_, had behaved magnificently, they had shown\r\nthemselves worthy of every kind of liberty. Not a theft, not a single\r\nviolation of property, had been committed. “The people,” in rags\r\n(_loqueteux_) put up notices, “Death to Thieves,” in the corridors of\r\nthe Tuileries. “The people,” themselves penniless, had protected the\r\ntreasures in the Bank.\r\n\r\nOn the great day of the Revolution, the 26th of February, Dr. Lambert\r\ncame over to Chauny. He was in the seventh heaven of delight. Even\r\nMme. Seron did not seem alarmed at the monarchy’s collapse. Her\r\nhusband, however, was less pleased. He had thought that the Revolution\r\nwould be made on behalf of his hero, Louis Buonaparte. And this\r\nsoldier of _la grande armée_ vented his spleen on the first republican\r\nwho came to his hand. This unhappy republican[12] chanced to be his\r\nson-in-law. “Your Republic,” he jeered, “your stupidly democratic\r\nRepublic!”\r\n\r\n“But,” writes Juliette, “father only laughed, grandmother smiled, and\r\nI said—\r\n\r\n“‛Ah! my poor grandfather, your Buonaparte must be very sick at our\r\nRepublic, however socialist he has pretended to be.’”\r\n\r\nJuliette remembers that, towards the end of dinner on that fateful\r\n26th of February, her grandfather, having, by way of consolation for\r\nhis disappointment, drunk an extra bottle or so of his _petit Macon_,\r\nopening his eyes very wide, addressed his family, and said: “Well! I\r\nsee the future as clear as day!... I see your Republic, do you hear\r\nme, Lambert? Do you hear me, Juliette? I see it trampled under foot by\r\nmy Buonaparte. I tell you, I scream it at you: revolutions, don’t you\r\nknow, always end in empires.”[13]\r\n\r\nAt school next day Juliette found all her friends in a state of great\r\nagitation. Half of the scholars had stayed away. Their parents had\r\nbeen afraid to let them leave home. The Revolution might spread into\r\nthe provinces. There was a glass factory in the town, and all the\r\nworkmen were in favour of the Republic. Might they not proclaim it at\r\nChauny, and revolt and perhaps plunder?\r\n\r\nHardly had Juliette arrived at school than she was summoned to the\r\nstudy of the Mlles. André. There she was questioned as to what her\r\nfather thought of the situation.\r\n\r\n“‛Well, Juliette, your father must be highly pleased, he who has\r\nalways been a republican. Have you seen him?’\r\n\r\n“‛Yes, mesdemoiselles, he came yesterday, and he is delighted. He says\r\nthat at last France will show herself worthy of her history, that she\r\nwill govern herself, that all the European nations will admire us and\r\nperhaps follow our example, that it is the coming of the people, the\r\nreal people, which is not corrupt like the middle-class, and which ...’\r\n\r\n“‛That is enough,’ interrupted the eldest Mlle. André drily. ‛I hope,\r\nJuliette, that you will keep your father’s fine notions to yourself. I\r\nforbid you to speak of them here.’\r\n\r\n“‛In the schoolroom, mademoiselle?’\r\n\r\n“‛In the schoolroom and in the playground.’\r\n\r\n“I looked Mlle. André in the face,” writes Juliette. I was almost as\r\ntall as she; and I replied—\r\n\r\n“‛That, mademoiselle, I can’t promise you; for there are a great many\r\nof us republicans in the school, and no one can prevent our talking\r\nabout the Republic and loving it.’\r\n\r\n“‛But France has not accepted your Republic,’ replied the youngest\r\nMlle. André, Mlle. Sophie.\r\n\r\n“‛It will accept it, mademoiselle, because this time the people will\r\nvote.’”\r\n\r\nThe Mlles. André were perplexed. They hesitated between their desire\r\nto shut the mouth of their precocious and self-assertive pupil, and\r\ntheir reluctance to be hard on their friend’s daughter, and also to\r\nannoy the republican parents of the other scholars.\r\n\r\nFinally they decided to bring the interview to a close by the\r\nfollowing judicious remark: “When you see your father, Juliette, you\r\nmay tell him from us that we hope his Republic will bring peace to\r\nFrance and not agitate it further.”\r\n\r\nOn coming forth from the mistresses’ presence, Juliette was, of\r\ncourse, the object of universal interest among the scholars. They\r\nwere burning to know what had passed in the principals’ sanctum. But\r\nthey could not satisfy their curiosity until school was over. The\r\nlessons that morning were not well known, and the general excuse was\r\nthe Republic. “Mademoiselle, I have not had time to do my lessons\r\nbecause of the Republic.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle, I couldn’t work because of the Republic.”\r\n\r\n“I fail to understand,” was the icy retort, “how the Republic can be\r\nany concern of yours.”\r\n\r\nThere was a deep silence, and then a voice—it was Juliette’s—made\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n“But, mademoiselle, it interests us passionately.”\r\n\r\nThe end of morning school was a regular riot. The pupils rushed out\r\ninto the playground, where they surrounded Juliette, in a crowd,\r\nclamouring to receive a full account of her famous interview. She,\r\non her part, was only too eager to relate it in every detail, and to\r\nfollow it by an appeal to her comrades to bear themselves like true\r\nand worthy republicans, not to be insolent towards their teachers, but\r\nto make them realise that, although younger than they, the Republic\r\nregarded them as their elders’ equals. Then followed a babel of\r\nconversation. Each schoolgirl had her own idea of what the Republic\r\nshould do. But all were agreed that the first reform must be the\r\nestablishment of universal suffrage. No mere tax-payers’ franchise\r\nwould satisfy these ardent suffragettes. Every one must vote, men,\r\nwomen, and, of course, schoolgirls. Only thus could the Mlles. André’s\r\npupils conceive of a really universal suffrage, and later they prided\r\nthemselves on having invented it.\r\n\r\nNothing in the Revolution pleased Juliette’s father better than the\r\nopening of the National Workshops. An ardent believer in the right to\r\nwork, he, with his idol, Louis Blanc, had always advocated them. And\r\nthough Louis Blanc did not appear to be directly concerned with those\r\nthat the Government was establishing, Dr. Lambert, like most people,\r\nbelieved that he was secretly connected with them. They had not been\r\nrunning more than a few weeks, however, when he began to suspect that\r\nhe had been mistaken. As time went on he grew less and less satisfied\r\nwith the Republic. There were too many reactionaries in the National\r\nAssembly. This Republic, from which he had hoped so much, was too\r\npleasing to comfortable middle-class people like his mother-in-law.\r\n\r\n“Jean Louis,” she would say, “I find that I agree very well with your\r\nRepublic.” “Wait a little,” her son-in-law would reply at first. By\r\nand by he would answer: “You agree with it better than I do.” And\r\nfinally there came a day when he exclaimed: “No wonder you approve of\r\nthe Republic, for it is constituted for your advantage! The Orléans\r\nmay come back and they will not need to alter anything as far as their\r\n_bourgeois_ supporters are concerned.”[14]\r\n\r\nSeeing his dream of a Christian, classical, social, scientific\r\nRepublic vanish, Dr. Lambert resumed his old part of malcontent,\r\nand, of course, Juliette followed suit. She filled the house with\r\nher recriminations. She made herself excessively disagreeable to her\r\ngrandparents. Her grandfather infuriated her by chuckling with delight\r\nand repeating: “All this augurs well for the Empire.”\r\n\r\nThat which most distressed Juliette and her father was the failure of\r\nthe National Workshops. It had become obvious that, far from being\r\norganised by Louis Blanc, they had been initiated by his enemies.\r\nÉmile Thomas, who directed them, was suspected of being Louis\r\nNapoléon’s agent. Far from constituting, as Dr. Lambert had fondly\r\ndreamed, a national benefit and a model for the whole civilised\r\nworld, they proved useless and costly. They grew like an ulcer;\r\nas many as 119,000 men were on the pay-roll. They were a club of\r\nloafers, a reserve army of insurrection, a perpetual strike supported\r\nout of public money. No wonder there was talk of suppressing them.\r\nBut Dr. Lambert, though bitterly disappointed with the way they\r\nwere conducted, was horrified at the idea of suddenly depriving of\r\noccupation and turning adrift these thousands of workmen. It would\r\nmean, he thought, nothing short of a sanguinary revolution. Juliette,\r\nof course, shared her father’s horror. What had “the people,” “the\r\npeople” who had behaved so admirably on the 26th of February, done to\r\ndeserve such treacherous treatment? She could think of nothing else.\r\nHer rage and disappointment were such that she became absolutely\r\ninsupportable. And when her grandmother remonstrated with her, she\r\nimplored to be allowed to go to Blérancourt to her father, who shared\r\nher disappointment. But Mme. Seron was still living in dread of her\r\nson-in-law’s threat of a working-class marriage for his daughter.\r\nShe had other ideas for Juliette. “Already,” she told her little\r\ngranddaughter, “you have pleased young X——, who is seventeen; and\r\nhis father, half in jest, half in earnest, because of your age, has\r\nsuggested that in a few years’ time there might be an alliance between\r\nthe families.” Moreover, Mme. Seron did not wish again to interrupt\r\nher daughter’s studies. So she proposed a compromise. Instead of going\r\nto Blérancourt, Juliette might become a boarder at the _pension_.[15]\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was a terrible blow to Juliette. That such a proposal\r\nshould come from her grandmother, that she, who generally complained\r\nof the length of the school hours which deprived her of her idolised\r\ngranddaughter’s company, should now of her own free will suggest a\r\nfar longer separation, seemed incredible. The child was quick to see\r\nthat her own behaviour had brought her grandmother to such a pass. By\r\nher ravings and recriminations she had made herself intolerable. Her\r\ngrandmother was glad to get rid of her.\r\n\r\n“I was thunderstruck,” she writes. “Nothing but wicked pride kept me\r\nfrom throwing myself on my grandmother’s neck and asking pardon for my\r\nfolly; for I realised how wild and extravagant I had been. But what\r\ngrandmother had told me about X——, a tall youth, whom I thought both\r\nhandsome and clever, had so puffed me up that I could not see a young\r\nperson like myself, close upon twelve, kneeling to ask forgiveness\r\nlike a little girl. So, though my heart was in my mouth all the while,\r\nI merely said—\r\n\r\n“‛Very well, grandmother, it is understood, I will be a boarder as\r\nsoon as you like.’\r\n\r\n“‛To-morrow,’ she replied.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from these reflections that her father’s and\r\ngrandmother’s adoration had not, as it might well have done,\r\ncompletely warped their idolised Juliette’s disposition. They had made\r\nher absurdly vain, but they had not stifled a certain critical sense\r\nwhich even at that early age the little girl was beginning to turn\r\nupon herself. In this wholesome exercise she was encouraged by her\r\nmother’s severity. Whenever her father praised, her mother scolded.\r\n\r\n“When father,” she writes, “spoke of my intelligence and my good\r\nlooks, mother declared that I was as stupid as I was plain. It seemed\r\nto me that both of them exaggerated. And I began to judge myself,\r\nas I have done ever since, with a certain detachment. At heart I am\r\nreally grateful to my mother for having preserved me from complete\r\nself-satisfaction.”[16]\r\n\r\nJuliette’s career as a boarding-school miss, which resulted from her\r\nenthusiasm for and her disappointment with the scheme of National\r\nWorkshops, was destined to be as short-lived as that great national\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nIt was bad enough to be _un enfant gâté_ removed from her fond\r\nrelatives and subjected to all the rules of an institution. But her\r\npersonal sorrows were intensified by the thought of hundreds of\r\nthousands of workpeople about to be threatened with starvation. By\r\nthis apprehension Juliette’s schoolfellows were likewise depressed. An\r\natmosphere of gloom pervaded the playground. Instead of playing games,\r\nthe girls gathered together to discuss the fate of their unfortunate\r\ncompatriots. “There was not one of us,” Juliette writes, “who did\r\nnot deny herself goodies in order to save a few pence with which to\r\nhelp these poor people. We were always counting up our resources. We\r\nthought we might just be able to feed one of them. I decided that we\r\nwould address an elegant epistle to the minister Trélat,[17] whom\r\nwe abhorred. For him we held responsible for everything. We would\r\npropose to him to undertake the support of one of the workmen from\r\nthe National Workshops. Certainly one out of a hundred thousand\r\n(_sic_)[18] was not much; but if every _pension_ did the same, some\r\nwould be saved in any case.”[19]\r\n\r\nThe composition of such a letter was not easy. In order to bring\r\nto bear upon it as much intelligence as possible, the republican\r\nscholars classified themselves in groups, eleven in all. Each group\r\ndrew up a draft of the letter. These drafts were compared, the best\r\npassages selected from each, and finally the letter was dispatched to\r\na friend of Juliette in Paris, that same Professor Charles who had\r\nembraced her on her fourth birthday. He was now a public functionary,\r\nand he was requested to deliver to the minister the all-important\r\nmissive.\r\n\r\n“Daily,” records Juliette, “we expected the arrival of our _protégée_,\r\nour _atelier national_, as we called him.” He had been instructed by\r\nthe famous letter to present himself at the Pensionnat André, and to\r\nannounce himself as Juliette Lambert’s _protégée_. His benefactresses\r\nmeanwhile were busily preparing for his arrival. Cakes and sweetmeats\r\nwere tabooed. “_Nous économisions avec frénésie_,” writes Juliette.\r\nThey also, under every imaginable pretext, begged from their friends\r\nand relatives.\r\n\r\nOne of them had been so fortunate as to obtain a suit of clothes\r\nbelonging to her brother. Having cleaned and mended it with the\r\ngreatest care, she kept it in readiness for the _atelier national_,\r\nwho would doubtless arrive in rags.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the plot was kept a dead secret; for the conspirators\r\nwere well aware that their sympathy for _ces monstres des ateliers\r\nnationaux_ would meet with no encouragement at home.\r\n\r\nWhile at Chauny the Mlles. André’s pupils were eagerly awaiting the\r\narrival of their expected _monstre_, at Paris affairs were moving\r\nquickly. The men who had been paid forty cents a day for digging\r\ntrenches in the Champs de Mars and filling them up again were sticking\r\nto their job in defiance of the Government’s orders to disband. The\r\nSocialists sympathised with them and organised street manifestations\r\nin their favour. Finally, on the 23rd of June, the capital broke\r\nout into open insurrection. It was at this juncture that Juliette\r\nreceived, not the eagerly expected _atelier national_, but a letter\r\nfrom Professor Charles which dashed all her hopes to the ground. He,\r\nto whom had been entrusted that elegant epistle to the minister, had\r\nbasely deserted the young friends who had confided in him. Professor\r\nCharles had no sympathy with the State-employed workmen; he described\r\nthem in his letter to Juliette as _ces misérables qui t’intéressent_.\r\nCharles was immediately banished from Juliette’s heart. Her _ex-ami\r\nCharles_, she called him, severely, when she announced to her comrades\r\nthis terrible disappointment.\r\n\r\nThen there followed much secret confabulation among the Republican\r\ngroups of the _pension_. The pupils agreed that while blood was\r\nflowing in the streets of Paris, they at Chauny could not remain\r\ninactive. Already the revolution in the capital was finding an echo in\r\nthe provincial town. Bands of rebels were marching down the streets.\r\nWhy should not _les demoiselles de la pension André_ join them?\r\nJuliette counted among her treasures a large handkerchief given her\r\nby her father and emblazoned with the words: _Vive la République,\r\nDémocratique et Sociale_. Attaching this emblem to a pole abstracted\r\nfrom the wood-shed, the girls, under Juliette’s leadership, organised\r\nthemselves into a procession and marched round the playground, crying:\r\n“Long live the Democratic and Social Republic. Long live the rebels.\r\nWe will not disband. We will not disband.”\r\n\r\nThis manifestation, the tumultuous scenes to which it led, the defiant\r\nwords which she addressed to her governesses, resulted in Juliette’s\r\nexpulsion from school. For the Mlles. André rightly regarded her as\r\nthe leader of the revolution.\r\n\r\nMlle. Sophie conducted her back to her grandmother’s house. Mme.\r\nSeron was already regretting having sent her granddaughter away.\r\nShe would, therefore, have been glad to see her back under almost\r\nany circumstances. But to find her distinguishing herself as the\r\noriginator and ringleader of a rebellion gratified the pride and\r\nambition of her own rebellious heart. So, after listening to Mlle.\r\nSophie’s story, Mme. Seron said with dignity: “If you regard her\r\nbehaviour as a defiance of your authority, then you are quite right\r\nto dismiss her.... But this episode shows me Juliette as I like to\r\nsee her, displaying a determination and a courage such as are not\r\ngiven to every one. Since, without my seeking her, the child has been\r\nbrought back to me, neither she nor I will be distressed. I have\r\nrather, mademoiselle, to thank you than to ask you to reconsider your\r\ndecision.”\r\n\r\nThus after a few weeks terminated Juliette’s career as a boarder, and,\r\nindeed, her schooldays, for she never returned to the _pension_.\r\n\r\nAt Chivres, whither, on the 1st of July, Juliette went for a three\r\nmonths’ visit, she found herself promptly deposed from the pedestal on\r\nto which, as a reward for her defiance of authority, her grandmother\r\nand her father, too, had elevated her. The aunts had never heard of\r\nsuch nonsense; they scolded her roundly for her conduct. They had\r\nno sympathy whatever with the _ateliers nationaux_. And, during the\r\nviolent suppression of the rising which followed, their sympathies\r\nwere entirely with the _bourgeoisie_. Juliette was condemned to keep\r\nher opinions to herself, and even to read the newspaper by stealth.\r\nInstead of arguing about things she did not understand, she worked\r\nhard at her Latin. And in the serenity of her aunts’ presence,\r\ncontrasting with their educated minds her own empty little head, she\r\ncame to see herself as she really was: a pretentious young person,\r\nvery ignorant, and fond of airing opinions she had borrowed from other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nConsequently it was in a chastened frame of mind that Juliette\r\nreturned in the autumn to Chauny. And her grandmother found her quite\r\nwilling to fall in with the new scheme of life which she suggested.\r\nThe storms of the past had strengthened Mme. Seron’s conviction that\r\nJuliette was a child to be led and not driven. In broaching the\r\nsubject of her future studies, therefore, Mme. Seron began with this\r\ntactful observation—\r\n\r\n“Now, my Juliette, you will do exactly as you like. You will learn\r\nwhat you wish, or you will, if you prefer it, learn nothing at all.\r\nBut there is one thing in which I do ask you to take an interest:\r\nthat is housekeeping. I will give you complete charge of our house\r\nfor six months. You shall be its mistress to order and to spend.\r\nI shall merely advise you. As you are fond of the appointing, the\r\narrangement, the decoration of a home, you will have full scope for\r\nthe development of your taste. If you would like lessons in cooking\r\nand sewing, you have only to say so. I want to persuade you, too, that\r\nan art, and above all arts, music, embellishes life. The new organist\r\nis a remarkably good teacher. The piano bores you, but I wish you to\r\ncultivate your voice. And then I have another wish: I want you to try\r\nthe violin. But, I repeat, you shall do as you like in everything.”[20]\r\n\r\nTo these diplomatic suggestions Juliette was graciously pleased to\r\nreply—\r\n\r\n“Grandmother, I shall be delighted to keep house; it will be very\r\ninteresting. I will certainly learn the violin. That will be quite out\r\nof the common: and I will cultivate my voice.”\r\n\r\nHow the Seron household fared during the _régime_ of this young\r\nlady of twelve Juliette has not told us. But that her grandmother’s\r\nsomewhat bold experiment was in the end eminently successful is\r\nattested by the fact that throughout her long life Mme. Adam has\r\nbeen renowned as a first-rate _maîtresse de maison_; and that this\r\nreputation is fully justified is the experience of all those who, like\r\nthe present writer, have partaken of her lavish hospitality.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of her studies, Mme. Seron had been well advised\r\nto leave it to her granddaughter to decide as to whether she would\r\ncontinue them. Juliette was far too ambitious to be content with her\r\nvery meagre knowledge. And it was at her own suggestion that her\r\nfather was asked to draw up a time-table for his daughter.\r\n\r\nA professor from the boys’ school opposite was engaged to give\r\nher lessons; and Dr. Lambert himself, when he came to Chauny,\r\nsuperintended her studies. He read her Racine, and persuaded her to\r\ncopy daily five pages from the pen of that great French classic. The\r\ndoctor, as we have said, was himself a pure classicist. He used to say\r\nto his daughter, “Be a Grecian, Juliette, if you desire initiation\r\ninto the worship of the eternally beautiful, into all that raises man\r\nabove the age in which he lives.”[21]\r\n\r\nIn order to accustom his daughter to what he called the admirable\r\nsonority of _notre langue initiatrice_ he read her passages from Homer\r\nin the Greek original. He dictated to her word by word translations\r\nof whole chapters of the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_. In these lessons,\r\nin his own reading and in his talks with Juliette, Dr. Lambert found\r\nconsolation for his bitter political disillusionment. “Books,” he\r\nwould say, “are our greatest solace, when everything else is taken\r\nfrom us they remain.”[22]\r\n\r\nHe refused to talk of politics. The collapse of the June insurrection,\r\nits brutal suppression by General Cavaignac, and, finally, the\r\nelection on the 10th of December, 1848, of his enemy, Louis Napoléon,\r\nas President of the Republic had disappointed all his hopes.\r\n\r\nIn the glorious days of the Republic’s dawn Dr. Lambert had consented\r\nto be Mayor of Blérancourt. His daughter describes how she and her\r\ngrandmother came over from Chauny to see the Mayor, attired in a\r\nworkman’s blue blouse and wearing the tricolour scarf tied with red,\r\nplant the Tree of Liberty, a young poplar, in the village square.\r\nIn his delight at what seemed to promise the realisation of all his\r\ndreams, this agnostic had become reconciled even to the curé. The\r\nvillage priest was present to bless the Tree of Liberty. And in his\r\nspeech this broad-minded cleric declared that the Republic, if it\r\npractised its doctrines of liberty, fraternity and equality, would\r\nrealise the gospel ideal, but that it could only rise to such a height\r\nprovided that all republicans in spirit, if not in form, were as\r\nChristian as the new Mayor. Then, much to his daughter’s astonishment,\r\nDr. Lambert replied that the Republic, with its principles of liberty,\r\nequality and fraternity, had without doubt originated in Christianity;\r\nthat Jesus Christ was the first Socialist and the first Republican;\r\nthat republicans had much to learn from the Church, but that the\r\nChurch on its side had to learn from republicans to adore nature\r\nand to follow science. “My dear Mayor,” said M. le Curé after the\r\nceremony, “you would accept the Christian religion blindfold if only\r\nit would consent to become pagan.” “Yes,” replied the Mayor, laughing,\r\n“but I want you in return to accept my paganism, which is founded on a\r\nlove of nature, on condition that it is inspired by Christian virtues.”\r\n\r\nAlas! only a few months later that roseate dawn of optimistic idealism\r\nhad faded into the night of grim reaction. One by one the socialistic\r\nexperiments of 1848 had failed. The socialist leader, Louis Blanc,\r\nhad been discredited and driven into exile. The more moderate\r\nLedru-Rollin, having, like most moderates, failed to please any party,\r\nhad been excluded from the Government. And by the end of the year,\r\nafter all her bright dreams of liberty, the one cry which went up from\r\nFrance was for a strong government. The cry was answered by Louis\r\nNapoléon’s election to the presidency. Old Dr. Seron’s prophecy had\r\ncome true. Encouraged by the success of his divinations, Juliette’s\r\ngrandfather continued to prognosticate. “Sure as my name is Seron,”\r\nhe declared, “Louis Napoléon Buonaparte, from simple Prince Louis,\r\nfrom simple Buonaparte, will, before the expiration of his presidency,\r\nbecome Emperor Napoléon III.”[23]\r\n\r\n“Alas! he is right,” said Dr. Lambert[24].... “All my beautiful\r\nfabric has fallen, stone by stone; and I am crushed beneath its\r\nruins.... Juliette, I shall never again talk or write to you of\r\npolitics.” But, though abstaining from political talk, Dr. Lambert\r\ncould not withdraw from interest in political affairs. Though he had\r\nresigned his mayoralty, though he had severed all official connection\r\nwith this sad travesty of a Republic, though the Tree of Liberty\r\nwhich he had planted had been dug up, he still clung to the vestige\r\nof his political dreams. And he continued to try to carve out a\r\nnew destiny for France. If he could not work for her in the open,\r\nhe would plot and plan in secret. Dr. Lambert, like many another\r\ndisillusioned French republican, joined one of those secret societies\r\nwhich were being formed all over France. Juliette, when she next\r\nvisited Blérancourt, found her parents’ home the centre of mysterious\r\nmeetings, her father the recipient of mysterious correspondence which\r\nhis wife urged him to destroy. One day, rummaging in the attic,\r\nJuliette chanced upon a hoard of papers, lists of names and letters,\r\nthe import of which, enlightened by her parents’ conversation, she was\r\nquick to guess; and instantly there flashed on her vivid imagination\r\nthe whole danger of the situation. With Juliette Adam action has\r\nnever failed to follow swiftly upon the heels of thought. An hour\r\nor two after that discovery Juliette was busy making herself a big\r\npocket, which she tied round her waist and wore beneath her frock. In\r\na day or two that which she dreaded happened. Dr. Lambert’s house was\r\nvisited by the Procureur de la République, accompanied by an escort of\r\ngendarmes. To the dismay of Juliette’s parents the Procureur produced\r\na document entitling him to search the house. He began with the\r\ndoctor’s desk in the room where the family was then sitting at lunch.\r\n\r\n“What you are doing is not at all nice. It is even indiscreet,”\r\nsaid Juliette, much to the functionary’s amusement. It was a sultry\r\nmidsummer day. Said Juliette to her terrified mother: “May I not go\r\nand tell Blatier” (the gardener, who, with a scared look, was peeping\r\nthrough the window) “to cool some cider for these gentlemen?” Mme.\r\nLambert made a sign of assent. A minute before, when she had wished to\r\ngo into another room, a gendarme had prevented her. But no objection\r\nwas offered to her little girl’s departure. All the while, however,\r\nthat she was telling Blatier to draw water from the well she felt a\r\ngendarme’s eyes fixed upon her through the window. While the gardener\r\nwas drawing the water, she went down into the cellar, brought up\r\nsome bottles, placed them in a pail. Intentionally prolonging the\r\noperation, she went down to fetch another pail, then, turning round,\r\nmade as if she would return slowly to the room. But no sooner was\r\nshe out of the gendarme’s sight than with one bound, having taken\r\noff her shoes, she flew upstairs to the attic, seized the papers,\r\nslipped them into her pocket, and in a trice had put on her shoes\r\nagain, was back in the sitting-room, having apparently come straight\r\nfrom her cider-cooling in the courtyard. M. le Procureur was still\r\nbusily searching. Having examined the living-rooms, he and his escort\r\nsearched the stable, the coach-house, the cellar. Then, leaving one\r\ngendarme below, he went up into the attic.\r\n\r\n“When father heard them go upstairs,” writes Juliette, “he rose, he\r\nlooked very agitated, and I saw mother, saying to herself: ‛The papers\r\nmust be there; we are lost.’\r\n\r\n“Then, taking a glass of cider, I went up to father, whom the gendarme\r\nwas closely observing. He put away the glass I offered him, but I,\r\nas if persuading him to drink, bent towards him and whispered: ‛Be\r\ncalm. I have the papers.’ Father drank the glass of cider at one gulp.\r\nI embraced him. The gendarme was touched by our affection. Father\r\nclasped[25] me in his arms so tight that I thought I should have been\r\nstifled!...”\r\n\r\nThe Procureur de la République came downstairs. Before leaving he\r\nsaid to Juliette: “Mademoiselle, I am glad to tell you that we have\r\nfound nothing to compromise your father. Had we discovered proofs of\r\nthe matters of which he stands accused it would have been serious.\r\nFor your father’s name figures on the list of those liable to\r\narrest, imprisonment, or even deportation. He is reputed a dangerous\r\nrevolutionary and propagandist to boot.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” replied Juliette. “As you are so fatherly to me,\r\nyou, too, must have a daughter.” The Procureur smiled, but did not\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nFor the time, this child of thirteen had saved her father’s liberty,\r\nperhaps his life. But she had not placed him out of danger, because\r\nshe had not cured him of plotting against the Government. Henceforth,\r\nindeed, until Dr. Lambert’s death, his daughter was to live in\r\nconstant dread of her father’s so embroiling himself with the\r\nauthorities as to be clapped into prison or even deported. The episode\r\nwe have just related was only the first of many times when he narrowly\r\nescaped arrest. When, years later, Juliette was living with her father\r\nin Paris and he was late in returning to meals, she always expected to\r\nhear that he was in prison.\r\n\r\nNot long after this domiciliary visit, in the spring of 1850, Dr.\r\nLambert entertained the idea of giving up his practice at Blérancourt,\r\nand joining one of the phalansteries or socialistic communities then\r\nin vogue. However, he listened to the entreaties of his family and\r\nrenounced this project.\r\n\r\n“Juliette,” said Mme. Seron to her granddaughter, “how can you wish a\r\ncountry to be led by persons so wild as your father?” “And, for the\r\nmoment,” writes Juliette, “I agreed with her.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] _Souvenirs_, I. 247.\r\n\r\n[9] _Biographie Générale_ under “Ledru-Rollin.”\r\n\r\n[10] See _post_, 243.\r\n\r\n[11] _Souvenirs_, I. 272.\r\n\r\n[12] _Souvenirs_, I. 280.\r\n\r\n[13] _Ibid._, 281.\r\n\r\n[14] _Souvenirs_, I. 295.\r\n\r\n[15] _Souvenirs_, I. 300.\r\n\r\n[16] _Souvenirs_, I. 348.\r\n\r\n[17] Trélat, Minister of Education, so Dr. Lambert had told\r\nJuliette, had been one of the bitterest opponents of the National\r\nWorkshops.

J’irai à Paris._”—Mme. Adam, _Roman\r\n     de mon Enfance_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the events recorded in the last chapter that\r\nJuliette at thirteen was both mentally and morally much more developed\r\nthan a young English girl of eighteen or even twenty. Children in\r\nFrance, largely because they associate constantly with their elders\r\ninstead of being relegated to the nursery, grow up more quickly than\r\nin England. A little French girl often is quite a little woman. She\r\nwill go with her mother to pay calls, and at home help her mother to\r\nentertain visitors. The system in vogue in Juliette’s childhood of\r\nmarrying girls at fifteen or sixteen naturally favoured their early\r\ndevelopment. The early marriage was the outcome of the _mariage de\r\nconvenance_, which was more general in Juliette’s youth than now. When\r\nmarriages were arranged by the family it was unnecessary to wait until\r\nthe young people, the bride at any rate, was old enough to choose\r\nwisely for herself. Though it would not have been admitted that girls\r\nwere married against their will, though their consent to the marriage\r\nwas generally asked, not by the aspirant, usually, but by the girls’\r\nparents, it was a mere matter of form, everything having been settled\r\nbeforehand. Moreover, the girl in question, when appealed to in this\r\nperfunctory manner, was not encouraged to consult her heart. Indeed,\r\nthat very uncertain and awkward factor is not supposed to intervene\r\nin what is known as the real French marriage. It is essentially a\r\nbusiness affair, a matter of social position and of pounds, shillings\r\nand pence. We shall find, for instance, that in arranging a marriage\r\nfor her granddaughter, Mme. Seron’s chief concern was that Juliette\r\nshould have an establishment in Paris. This, in the first place,\r\nwould give her an opportunity of displaying to full advantage her many\r\ngifts, and, secondly, would enable her fond grandmother to shine in\r\nmetropolitan circles, for Mme. Seron hoped to make some arrangement\r\nwhereby she could for a considerable part of the year reside with her\r\ngranddaughter.\r\n\r\nJuliette was not married until she was sixteen. But, as we have\r\nseen, no sooner had she entered her teens than her grandmother and\r\nfather began—in divergent directions, of course—to make plans for her\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, that the parents of young X——, a youth of\r\nseventeen, proposed to Mme. Seron that in a few years he should marry\r\nJuliette. The following year brought a renewal of this proposal and\r\nalso a second offer of marriage from another quarter. Dr. Lambert\r\nrefused to listen to either of these requests for his daughter’s\r\nhand. His persistence in his idea of a working-class marriage for his\r\ndaughter drove his mother-in-law into a frenzy and produced another\r\n_drame de famille_. Mme. Seron threatened her son-in-law with the\r\ngendarmes if he attempted to carry out his nefarious scheme. Dr.\r\nLambert threatened to take Juliette abroad out of her grandmother’s\r\nreach. But in the end Mme. Seron conquered, and Dr. Lambert went off\r\nin a towering rage. For several months he ceased to visit Chauny.\r\n\r\nJuliette, who had now grown into a handsome girl, had already\r\nattracted considerable attention at Chauny. Those who are privileged\r\nto know her now, in her declining years, can see how lovely she must\r\nhave been in her youth. “She has had that singular good fortune ...,”\r\nwrites one of her friends to-day, “to have been adorably beautiful\r\n(_adorablement belle_).”[26] The delicately moulded features, the\r\nanimated expression, the satirical glance, the dignified bearing,\r\nthe vivacious manner, which at eighty never fail to charm, must have\r\nindeed been dazzling in her far-off girlhood. In a word, Juliette\r\nLambert was as gifted physically as mentally. No wonder that when,\r\nwearing a pretty blonde cap with pink roses, and escorted by her\r\ngrandfather and an old friend, Blondeau, who lived in the same house,\r\nshe made her first appearance at the Chauny theatre, there was quite a\r\nsensation, although when she returned her grandmother had to scold her\r\nfor having marred her beauty by weeping over the play.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between Mme. Seron and her son-in-law having died down,\r\nJuliette was permitted to spend the Christmas of 1850, and to stay on\r\ninto the New Year, at Blérancourt.\r\n\r\nIt was during this visit that she made the acquaintance of the man\r\nwho was to be her first husband. She was told one day that her father\r\nexpected a friend to lunch, that the guest was an advanced republican\r\nand a Comtist to boot. This was the first time that Juliette had heard\r\nthat name of Comte, which she was to learn to know only too well\r\nlater. The guest came. He was a barrister (_avocat_) at the Paris\r\nCourt of Appeal. But he lived at Soissons, where he was conducting a\r\nseries of law-suits on behalf of an aunt. His name was Lamessine. He\r\nwas of the south Italian type, with dark eyes, olive skin and shining\r\nblack hair, for his grandfather had been a Sicilian who had settled\r\nin France and been naturalised during the Revolution. Dr. Lambert’s\r\nvisitor was reputed a man of talent. His brilliant conversation\r\npleased Juliette; but she detested the scepticism which led him to\r\nmaintain that good is merely the necessary balance to evil, and\r\nthat society must grow increasingly corrupt until it produces a new\r\n“vegetation.” Against such doctrines Juliette could not refrain from\r\nprotesting. There was an animated discussion between the Sicilian,\r\nwho believed in nothing, and his host’s idealist daughter, who was\r\nready to believe in everything that was good. The guest departed\r\nwith the words, “And I hope you bear me no grudge, Mademoiselle _la\r\nBatailleuse_.” “I only pray,” she replied, “that Heaven may reveal to\r\nyou some knowledge, however slight, of the good and the beautiful.”[27]\r\n\r\nIn the spring, while Juliette was visiting her aunts, M. Lamessine\r\ncame to Chivres. There, though he found _La Batailleuse_ more charming\r\nthan ever in her peasant’s costume, which by clever contrivances and\r\nadaptations she had learnt to make extremely becoming, he met with\r\na cold welcome from the aunts and was not encouraged to return. In\r\nJune, however, while Juliette was at Blérancourt, he came to see her\r\nagain. Political affairs were moving towards Napoléon’s December\r\n_coup d’état_ and the empire which Dr. Seron had so persistently\r\nprophesied. There was a mysterious meeting at Dr. Lambert’s. And the\r\nnext day Juliette’s father said to her, “The crisis is grave; but we\r\nhave with us a man in whose veins flows the blood of the carbonari. He\r\nwill do something.” That man was M. Lamessine.\r\n\r\nIn December the barrister came to plead at Chauny. He presented\r\na letter of introduction to Dr. and Mme. Seron. They, unlike the\r\naunts, received him most cordially. Having been invited to dinner, he\r\ntold Juliette that, influenced by her arguments he had become less\r\nsceptical. She did not believe him. She was vaguely conscious of some\r\nulterior motive in his words. She felt ill at ease and left the salon\r\nearly. On the morrow her grandmother announced that M. Lamessine had\r\nasked for her hand in marriage, that his treatment of the important\r\nmatter of settlements was satisfactory, and that he was willing for\r\nMme. Seron to spend every winter with her granddaughter and her\r\nhusband when they should go to live in Paris.\r\n\r\nBut Juliette was not the kind of young person thus to be married out\r\nof hand and merely to please her grandmother. She was thunderstruck\r\nat such an announcement. She would not dream, she protested, of\r\nmarrying a man who was twice her age. In vain did Mme. Seron plead\r\nthat M. Lamessine was _très bien_, that his coming was providential,\r\nthat resembling feature for feature one of the heroes of her\r\nfavourite novelist Balzac, he could not fail to be the most suitable\r\nof husbands. “You must admit that I am right, Juliette,” she said,\r\nand forthwith she took down the volume in question and read the\r\ndescription. But even this striking likeness failed to reconcile\r\nher recalcitrant granddaughter to the match. Juliette appealed to\r\nher grandfather and to her old friend Blondeau, to save her from so\r\nuncongenial a mating, but to no purpose, for Mme. Seron had already\r\nwon them over to her side. There was, however, one member of the\r\nfamily who would be less easy to convince. And Juliette, as was her\r\ncustom, called in Blérancourt to redress the balance at Chauny.\r\nDr. Lambert, knowing more about the proposed bridegroom than his\r\nmother-in-law, was horrified at the idea of his marrying his daughter.\r\nA few days later when he and his wife came over to Chauny, he was\r\naghast to find how far things had gone. He would, he declared, never\r\ngive his consent to the marriage.\r\n\r\nThroughout the succeeding months there followed a long-drawn-out war\r\nof words, enlivened by perpetual _drames de famille_. At one time\r\nJuliette was forcibly carried off by her father to Blérancourt, then\r\nbrought back to Chauny by her mother, who desired the match and kept\r\nher at Chauny out of her father’s influence. He, unhappy man, worn out\r\nby domestic grief and political disappointment, fell ill, and during\r\nhis illness once again narrowly escaped arrest. Finally, his wife and\r\nmother-in-law broke down his resistance. By their importunity they had\r\nrendered his life unbearable. In a moment of passion he seems to have\r\nsaid: “Very well, do what you will,” then to have given his formal\r\nconsent, without which they could do nothing, and to have signed the\r\nfatal document which sealed Juliette’s unhappiness. Almost immediately\r\nDr. Lambert repented; but it was too late, and all he could do was to\r\nsignify his disapproval by absenting himself from the wedding.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy subject of so much dissension had been reduced almost to\r\nwelcome marriage even with so uncongenial a mate as M. Lamessine as\r\none way of escape from perpetual family quarrels.\r\n\r\nBut alas! experience proved that Dr. Lambert’s objections to the union\r\nhad been only too well founded. “The man whom they have chosen for\r\nyour husband,” her father had written to her, “is not one whom you can\r\never love or who will ever love you.”\r\n\r\nWith a delicate hand and in a few poignant phrases Mme. Adam in her\r\n_Souvenirs_ passes lightly over her married misery. Until after her\r\ndaughter was born, in September 1854, she kept her sufferings to\r\nherself, dreading the anguish which a revelation of them would inflict\r\non her loved ones. It was during her confinement at Blérancourt that\r\nDr. Lambert discovered her unhappiness. Some months later, while she\r\nwas visiting her granddaughter, it was borne in on Mme. Seron that she\r\nhad committed the gravest of blunders in marrying Juliette against her\r\nwill. Now that the last instalment of his wife’s dowry had been paid,\r\nM. Lamessine shamelessly avowed that he had never intended to keep his\r\npromise of receiving his wife’s grandmother as an inmate of his home\r\nevery winter.\r\n\r\n“You imagine Juliette happy,” he said. “She is not. Our\r\nmisunderstandings are perpetual. If we had you as a third, what would\r\nthey be like?”\r\n\r\n“Is it true, Juliette, that you are unhappy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she replied, “as unhappy as it is possible to be.”\r\n\r\nMme. Seron rose. She leant against a piece of furniture to avoid\r\nfalling, for she shook like a tree which has been uprooted.\r\n\r\nShe reminded her son-in-law of his promises. “They were only\r\nnecessary,” he remarked cynically, “as long as you had not completely\r\nfulfilled yours.”\r\n\r\nMme. Seron left the house abruptly. Juliette never saw her again. She\r\nwent home to Chauny to die. In eleven months she was followed by her\r\nhusband, Dr. Seron, for, as he said, he could not live without “his\r\ndear scold” (_sa chère grondeuse_).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the first three years of their married life the Lamessines\r\nresided at Soissons. But during that time they paid a visit to Paris;\r\nand Juliette had her first unforgettable impression of that brilliant\r\ncity which had figured so large in the dreams of herself and her\r\ngrandmother.\r\n\r\nWhen Lamessine first proposed to her that she should wean her baby,\r\nAlice, and come with him to Paris, she trembled. For in Paris, she\r\nfelt, her lot would be cast. Paris held her destiny. Her grandmother’s\r\nspirit seemed to dominate hers as soon as Paris entered into her life.\r\n\r\n“Bah,” said her father, when she told him of her hesitation. “Don’t be\r\nafraid of it. Set foot in it bravely. Look it in the face, this Paris.\r\nOne of two things will happen: either you will make your name there,\r\nas your poor grandmother desired, and then the trials of your unhappy\r\nmarriage will not have been in vain; or you will break your bonds and\r\ncome back to your father. With us you will lead a life, if not happy,\r\nat least free from those marital responsibilities which fill me with\r\nfear for your future.”[28]\r\n\r\nThe Paris which Juliette visited in 1855 was Paris of the early Second\r\nEmpire, “still in the freshness of its hopes and enthusiasm.” It was\r\nParis of the first universal exhibition, which was visited by Queen\r\nVictoria and Prince Albert, Paris at the close of the Crimean War.\r\n\r\nThis Paris fully came up to Juliette’s expectations. Never had she\r\nbeen so impressed save when as a little girl she had caught her first\r\nglimpse of the sea at Boulogne.[29]\r\n\r\n“It is impossible,” she writes, “to imagine the complete amazement of\r\na young provincial beholding Paris for the first time, overwhelmed by\r\nmyriads of sights never dreamed of.” From that moment Juliette adored\r\nParis with all the enthusiasm of her passionate soul. At a closer\r\nacquaintance, during a residence in the heart of Paris extending\r\nthrough several decades, it has never loosened its hold on her vivid\r\nimagination. We shall find her friend, Gambetta, in future years,\r\nspeaking to her of _votre_ Paris.\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight spent with her husband in an hotel on the Place\r\nLouvois, she still found herself, “uninitiated into the hundredth\r\npart of what she wanted to know.”[30] Herein lies the secret of the\r\noverpowering impression which Paris made upon her: “What she wanted\r\nto know!” Paris was to her the master-key to all knowledge. In Paris\r\nlived the great leaders of thought, with whose ideas her father had\r\nmade her familiar, the idealist politicians, whose Utopian dreams she\r\nhad made her own. In the streets of Paris had ebbed and flowed the\r\ntide of that wonderful revolution which had found an echo in Chauny\r\nstreets, and even in Mlle. André’s _pension_. In Paris might be seen\r\nthose exquisite masterpieces of Greek art, the living symbols of her\r\ndivine Homer.\r\n\r\nNevertheless a shadow fell even over the radiant exultation of those\r\nfirst weeks in Paris. From infancy to old age Juliette Adam has always\r\nbeen ambitious. It was no mere obscure existence in the great city\r\nthat she had pictured in her youthful dreams. Hers was to be no diary\r\nof a nobody. Encouraged by her grandmother, she longed for fame. But\r\nalas! her hopes were dashed when she found herself lost in the vast\r\ncrowds which thronged the boulevards, when she regarded the miles of\r\nwell-filled shelves in the immense halls of the Imperial Library. It\r\nseemed as if the only homage Paris would ever render her would be\r\nthe admiring glances of street arabs, who distinguished her as they\r\nhad done another Juliette. The young Mme. Lamessine despaired of\r\never emerging from the mass, of ever carving for herself even the\r\ntiniest niche in the temple of literary renown. For it was to be a\r\ndistinguished writer that she aspired. Already she had quite a hoard\r\nof youthful scribblings, infantile verses which her grandparents\r\nthought wonderful, romances over whose patriotic incidents the\r\nyouthful authoress had wept bitter tears, a prize essay, written in\r\ncompetition with the pupils of the boys’ school opposite her Chauny\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nDuring her life at Soissons, it was in study and in literary\r\ncomposition that Juliette had sought distraction from domestic\r\nunhappiness. Some of her verses, a poem entitled _Myosotis_, had\r\nactually been published and set to music by the cathedral organist.\r\n\r\nBut it was after her return from Paris that she achieved a success\r\nwhich encouraged her to hope that, perhaps, after all she might not\r\npass her life unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe popular novelist, Alphonse Karr, was then contributing to the\r\n_Siècle_ weekly articles on social subjects, entitled “Buzzings”\r\n(_Bourdonnements_). A girl friend of Juliette’s, Pauline Barbereux,\r\nused to bring her the _Siècle_ and together they read Karr’s articles.\r\nOne of these was on the crinoline, then at the height of its vogue.\r\nAfter having thoroughly enjoyed himself at the expense of all its\r\nabsurdities, Karr declared that there was not a single young and\r\npretty woman in France with sufficient independence of mind not to\r\nwear it. “There is I,” cried Juliette. “And what if I wrote and told\r\nhim so?” For though affecting the full skirt, pretty Mme. Lamessine\r\nhad always stopped short of the crinoline. Pauline was delighted with\r\nthe idea. So together they set to work to concoct the letter, which\r\nshould, of course, be anonymous. The writer, therefore, was able to\r\nenlarge on the charms of this independent young female who refused to\r\nanswer to the beck and call of fashion.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” wrote Juliette, “there is a pretty woman of twenty who\r\ndoes not wear the crinoline, who has never worn it, there is one in\r\nFrance, in the provinces, and that one is I, Juliette.”[31]\r\n\r\nMme. Adam, throughout her long life, has ever been a fervent feminist,\r\npassionately interested in woman’s rôle and position in society. In\r\nher childhood’s desultory reading she had eagerly devoured a volume\r\non the Fronde. It interested her because women played the principal\r\npart in it. And she was thinking of those _frondeuses_ when she led\r\nher schoolfellows round the playground behind the banner of the social\r\ndemocratic handkerchief.\r\n\r\nIt was not unnatural, therefore, that Juliette should insinuate into\r\nthis, her first contribution to the press, her own views on feminism,\r\nthough they were expressed as far as possible in the style of Alphonse\r\nKarr. To the accompaniment of little Alice’s baby gurglings, she read\r\nthe rough draft to Pauline, who, having declared it superb, dictated\r\nit solemnly while Juliette copied it on to magnificent paper. Then the\r\nwonderful document, “_the_ article,” as Pauline christened it, was\r\nre-read, folded carefully, put into an imposing envelope, signed with\r\na beautiful seal, which was engraved with the writer’s Christian name.\r\nThereupon, writes Juliette, we _repaired_ (no word less ceremonious\r\ncould express such an act) with our precious packet to the post.\r\n\r\nOh, that week, how interminable it seemed! Could it be possible that\r\nAlphonse Karr would reply to the letter? On the night before the\r\n_Siècle’s_ appearance Juliette dreamed of her poem, _Myosotis_. She\r\ninterpreted that dream as a good sign. The 20th of February, 1856,\r\ndawned. Would Paris read that letter signed Juliette?... Pauline comes\r\nin breathless, pale with excitement. The _Siècle_ flutters in her\r\nhand. “Juliette,” she cries, “it is all there.” “All.” “And then,”\r\nwrites Juliette,[32] “we take two chairs and we draw them close to one\r\nanother. We unfold the paper, and each holding one corner, we read.\r\nYes, the whole of my letter is there. I read it. Pauline reads it.\r\nNot a word has been changed. I burst into tears. Pauline weeps too.\r\nBaby Alice, playing on the carpet, when she sees us crying, begins to\r\nhowl. Her godmother, Pauline, soothes and consoles her. I think of my\r\ngrandmother ... and I cry: ‛Grandmother, I shall be a writer.’\r\n\r\n“I send father my article and tell him how I came to write it.”\r\n\r\nThis somewhat severe critic replied at length, and for the first time,\r\nit appeared, discerned in his daughter a promise of literary talent.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of her time at Soissons Juliette read voraciously,\r\ndesiring to prepare herself for Paris. Whirled suddenly into the great\r\nvortex of metropolitan life, as she expected to be, she could not hope\r\nto have any time for study. She must, therefore, work hard to fill\r\nup the gaps in her desultory education and to equip herself for the\r\nbrilliant career awaiting her.\r\n\r\nFinally her hopes were realised. She found herself the mistress of a\r\nflat in Paris in the Rue de Rivoli, with a balcony looking on to the\r\nLouvre and close to the Museum of Antiquities, the temple of her gods.\r\nHer grandmother’s faith in her seemed to be justified.\r\n\r\nBut alas! as the weeks went on, Juliette herself suffered\r\ndisappointment. The society in which she moved was utterly\r\nuncongenial. Her husband’s friends bored and revolted her; they talked\r\nof nothing but business; and her husband himself, when not discussing\r\naffairs, was for ever extolling the doctrines of Auguste Comte, whose\r\npositivism seemed to Juliette the negation of all her idealism. This\r\ndisappointment, and the unhappiness of her home life, brought on an\r\nattack of neuralgia. She consulted the doctor of her _quartier_, a\r\ncertain Dr. Bonnard, who had already corresponded with her father\r\nabout a medical pamphlet, of which Dr. Lambert was the author. The\r\ndoctor was quick to see that what Juliette needed was the physic of\r\ncongenial society. He himself fortunately was in touch with literary\r\npeople. He introduced her to two circles, one poetical, the other\r\nphilosophical, where his young patient speedily felt herself at home.\r\nIt was through Dr. Bonnard that the charming young Mme. Lamessine\r\nbecame a member of _L’Union des Poètes_. And it was a member of the\r\nUnion, who, on a certain memorable day, took Juliette to see her first\r\ngreat Paris celebrity. This was the aged Béranger, a poet, whose name\r\nhad been one of the household words of her childhood, whose songs\r\nexalting his adored Emperor her grandfather had known by heart.\r\n\r\nNever had Juliette seen “a simpler, more charming, more paternal, more\r\nkindly satirical old man.”[33] The poet had read some of his young\r\nvisitor’s compositions. And the verdict he passed on them was frank\r\nand somewhat brutal.\r\n\r\n“My child,” he said, “you will never be a poet, but you may one day be\r\na writer.”\r\n\r\nJuliette’s reception of this crushing dictum, while showing her\r\nsensitiveness to criticism, proves that her reason had not been warped\r\nby all the extravagant adulation she had received in childhood. For\r\nshe bore the veteran poet no grudge for his disappointment of her\r\nhopes. But, from that day, she ceased to write poetry and withdrew\r\nfrom the Poet’s Union.\r\n\r\nAs she was leaving, Béranger said to her, “Good-bye, my child. You\r\nwill soon forgive me.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye?” said Juliette, “why not _au revoir_? Don’t you like me?\r\nDon’t you wish ever to see me again?”\r\n\r\nShrugging his shoulders and looking through the open windows, he\r\nsaid, “I think that I shall soon be going up there to see the\r\n_Dieu des bonnes gens_.” He died shortly afterwards at the age of\r\nseven-and-seventy, in July 1857.\r\n\r\nBefore her reluctant resignation from the Poet’s Union Juliette\r\nhad begun to frequent a philosophical circle to which Dr. Bonnard\r\nintroduced her. We have seen how from her tenderest childhood her\r\nfather had made her acquainted with most of the numerous philosophical\r\nsystems—the ideas of Cousin, Fourier, Comte, Proudhon, and\r\nothers—which were at that time revolutionising human thought. With her\r\nnatural quickness and keenness of intuition Juliette had comprehended\r\ntheir main principles. Consequently she was not the least confused\r\nby the learned discussions which took place in the salon of her new\r\nfriends, M. and Mme. Fauvety.\r\n\r\nM. Charles Fauvety was founder and editor of a well-known publication,\r\n_La Revue Philosophique_. Among the chief contributors to this erudite\r\nmagazine was the philosopher, M. Charles Renouvier, the author of a\r\nlearned work, _Essais de Critique Générale_, in four volumes, which he\r\nwas then preparing, and which was not completed until 1864.\r\n\r\nM. Renouvier possessed that inestimable gift of lucid exposition,\r\nwhich is so essentially French. Listening to, engaging in, and noting\r\ndown his conversations with his editor, Juliette continued and carried\r\nto a point far advanced for one of her age and sex that philosophical\r\neducation which her father had begun. It had long been her habit to\r\nkeep a diary and to insert in it accounts of any discussion which\r\ninterested her. And it is to this habit that we owe the reproduction\r\nin her _Souvenirs_ of those entrancing conversations which give us so\r\nvivid a picture of the intellectual life of the period.\r\n\r\nThroughout Juliette’s early womanhood and maturity there was no one\r\nwho exercised a greater influence on French thought than Hippolyte\r\nTaine. His influence was at its zenith in the sixties; but already in\r\nthis year, 1857, those who like Fauvety and Renouvier were gifted with\r\nprophetic insight could discern his coming greatness.\r\n\r\nThe publication of Taine’s _Essais de Critique et d’Histoire_ was a\r\ngreat event in the circle of _La Revue Philosophique_.\r\n\r\n“These young men[34] are admirable,” cried Renouvier.[35] “And seldom\r\nhas it been given to forerunners, such as I, to take so great a\r\ndelight in their disciples. For I, in a way, hatched Taine.”\r\n\r\n“Taine,” said the editor of _La Revue Philosophique_, “will remain\r\nthe hope or the anxiety of every philosophical system. He has taken\r\na scourge in his hands. For the next half-century, he will enthrone\r\nhimself on the judgment seat, and he will scathe every idea which\r\nwears out with use. I, as a philosopher, fear him and rely upon him\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\nMme. Lamessine was not the only woman member of that erudite circle.\r\nThere was Mme. Fauvety, a clever woman, who had been an actress,\r\nand for a time the rival of Rachel. She mingled intelligently in\r\nthe philosophical discussions of her husband and his friends. There\r\nwas also a certain Mme. Jenny d’Héricourt, the only member of the\r\ncircle whom Juliette disliked. She too contributed to _La Revue\r\nPhilosophique_; and she was tainted with that narrow bigotry and\r\ndogmatism which were characteristic of the publication, but from\r\nwhich the broad-minded Renouvier was entirely free. A blue-stocking\r\nof the most objectionable type, _une vertu farouche_, as Juliette\r\ncalled her, _la forte_ Jenny was conceited, censorious, pedantic and\r\nan inveterate scandalmonger. Such a person would naturally refuse to\r\nbelieve that any one so young and pretty as Juliette could have the\r\nslightest comprehension of philosophy. Nevertheless, on one subject\r\nat least the feminine Juliette and the Amazonian Jenny were agreed:\r\nthey both detested Proudhon. Jenny had attacked his doctrines in an\r\nextremely able book, which Juliette had read and appreciated; for\r\nthe materialistic and purely economic ideas of the father of modern\r\nsyndicalism had never appealed to her, and she had fought many a\r\nbattle of words on that subject with Dr. Lambert, who admired him.\r\nBut, when Juliette ventured to discuss the economist with his female\r\ncritic, Mme. d’Héricourt was furious. “Would you believe it,” she\r\nexclaimed to Fauvety, “that young lady actually dares to take upon\r\nherself to underline Proudhon!” It was bold, doubtless, in one so\r\nyoung and so charming. But Mme. Lamessine, nothing daunted by Jenny’s\r\ngibes, was to be bolder still, as we shall see in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nWe should convey a very wrong impression of Juliette’s early womanhood\r\nif we represented her as entirely absorbed in abstruse studies and\r\nfrequenting only philosophers and blue-stockings. The lighter sides\r\nof life have always appealed to her. As a schoolgirl she excelled\r\nin games, and she has ever loved play as well as work. Now she was\r\neagerly grasping the opportunities of amusement which Paris of the\r\nEmpire knew so well how to offer, especially to one as attractive as\r\nMme. Lamessine.\r\n\r\nMme. Fauvety took her to the theatre—not to first nights, this wise\r\nex-actress preferred to wait until the players had perfected their\r\nparts, and it was not until the last performances were announced that\r\nshe considered a play really worth seeing. Alexandre Dumas _fils_\r\nwas then at the height of his popularity. _La Dame aux Camélias_,\r\n_Diane de Lys_, _La Question d’Argent_, were the talk of the town.\r\nThough Juliette had ceased to write poetry, she had not ceased to\r\nassociate with poets. And it was a member of the Poet’s Union who\r\ntook her to her first fancy-dress ball, where her escort appeared as\r\nVercingetorix, and she herself was disguised as the Gallic Cassandra,\r\nVellèda. She wore a long white robe, confined by a golden girdle from\r\nwhich hung a gilded scythe. Her arms were bare to the shoulder, and it\r\nwas for the first time in her life, she writes, “for even at dances\r\nin those days we wore sleeves.” Her light brown hair with its gleam\r\nof gold hung over her shoulders, crowned with a wreath of mistletoe.\r\nMeyerbeer, the musical idol of the early Empire, happened to be\r\npresent. Vellèda made a great impression on this queer little old man.\r\n“Why! she will make me forget my Selika!” (the composition on which\r\nhe was then engaged), he is said to have exclaimed. “I am too old to\r\nfall in love with a new face,” and he left the ball-room abruptly.\r\nFor months afterwards every morning Juliette received a bunch of\r\nviolets with the words, _Souvenir ému à Vellèda_—and one day came a\r\nticket for a box for the first night of the _Pardon de Ploërmel_. But\r\nshe never saw her aged admirer again. Some years after his death,\r\non the occasion of the first performance of his _L’Africaine_,\r\nJuliette received a ticket for a box in a little casket with a bunch\r\nof violets, tied with a ribbon on which was written _le dernier_.\r\n“She will come to the first night of _L’Africaine_ wherever she is,”\r\nMeyerbeer had said.\r\n\r\nAlready the Lamessines were in the whirl of political life. On the\r\n14th of January, 1858, the evening of Orsini’s attempted assassination\r\nof the Emperor, while they were shopping in the Palais Royal, a\r\nSicilian friend, who was with them, was arrested. On the next morning\r\ntheir flat was searched. But this time there were no compromising\r\ndocuments for Juliette to conceal. M. Lamessine had no difficulty in\r\nproving his friend’s innocence and obtaining his speedy release.\r\n\r\nThose were the days when the long conflict between _sermentistes_ and\r\n_abstentionistes_, which later was to rage high in Juliette’s salon,\r\nwas just beginning. The _sermentistes_ were those who consented to\r\ntake the oath of allegiance to the Empire, the _abstentionistes_ those\r\nwho held themselves completely aloof.\r\n\r\nJuliette and her friends at Mme. Fauvety’s were all ardent\r\n_abstentionistes_. They were disgusted when, in June 1857, the first\r\nso-called republican, Émile Ollivier, took the oath, on his election\r\nto the Corps Legislatif. Ollivier’s betrayal of the republican cause,\r\nthey regarded as all the more inexcusable because his father, one\r\nof the stalwarts of 1848, was then in exile through his loyalty to\r\nthe principles his son had sacrificed. But Ollivier and many others,\r\nwho speedily followed his example, had on their side no less a\r\ndemocrat than Proudhon. That unflinching advocate of the people’s\r\ncause maintained that to take the oath to the Emperor was merely\r\nto recognise the people’s sovereignty embodied in the chief of the\r\nState. Such an argument did not raise Proudhon in the esteem of so\r\nuncompromising a person as Juliette.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] Léon Daudet, _L’Entre-Deux-Guerres_, 235 (1915).\r\n\r\n[27] _Souvenirs_, I. 353.\r\n\r\n[28] _Souvenirs_, II. 13.\r\n\r\n[29] _Souvenirs_, I. 214.\r\n\r\n[30] _Ibid._, 16.\r\n\r\n[31] _Souvenirs_, II. 25.\r\n\r\n[32] _Souvenirs_, II. 26.\r\n\r\n[33] _Souvenirs_, II. 30.\r\n\r\n[34] Taine, born in 1828, was then twenty-nine.\r\n\r\n[35] _Souvenirs_, II. 39.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nHER FIRST BOOK\r\n\r\n1858\r\n\r\n     “_L’œuvre de Mme. Juliette Lambert n’est que l’hymne triomphante\r\n     des sentiments humains les plus nobles et les plus joyeux._”—Jules\r\n     Lemaître.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn and bred in an atmosphere of controversy, inheriting from\r\nher grandmother and father an argumentative disposition, it is\r\nnot surprising that in the field of polemics Juliette won her\r\nfirst literary laurels. Neither was it inconsistent with her\r\nambitious nature that she should have chosen for adversary the most\r\ndistinguished controversialist of the day. The socialist Proudhon\r\nwas regarded not only as an eminent economist but as a master of\r\ndialectics.\r\n\r\nProudhon’s masterpiece appeared on the 22nd of April, 1858. It was a\r\nwork in three volumes, entitled _La Justice dans la Révolution et dans\r\nl’Eglise_. Announced in 1854, this book had been eagerly awaited by\r\nphilosophic readers, among whom was Juliette’s father.\r\n\r\nDr. Lambert wrote to his daughter that she must buy _La Justice_ at\r\nonce, and that, as she finished each volume, she must send it down\r\nto him at Chauny. It was well that Juliette carried out her father’s\r\nrecommendation, for in a few days the book was suppressed[36] and\r\nits author, who had fled to Belgium, condemned to three years’\r\nimprisonment and a fine of 4000 francs.\r\n\r\nJuliette, as she read these pages, was compelled to recognise the\r\nexcellence of the writer’s style and the skill of his dialectics.\r\nBut the so-called “justice” which Proudhon here metes out to women\r\ncould not but infuriate so fervent a feminist. For even a cursory\r\nsurvey of this book will serve to reveal that the writer here carries\r\nthe anti-feminist argument to its extreme verge. No self-respecting\r\nwoman could possibly read these pages without being moved to\r\nindignation, unless she resolve to treat the matter as a huge joke;\r\nbut unfortunately Proudhon, like most pure economists, had no sense\r\nof humour: he only stumbled into being funny. A breath of the blessed\r\nilluminating comic spirit would have saved him from many a ludicrous\r\nabsurdity.\r\n\r\nJuliette’s resentment of the philosopher’s sweeping indictment of her\r\nsex was aggravated by his singling out for special condemnation the\r\ntwo women whom among her contemporaries she admired most. “_J’ai la\r\nfolie d’admirer_,” she has said of herself; and with all the ardour\r\nof her passionate soul she admired George Sand and Daniel Stern (la\r\nComtesse d’Agoult). It was precisely against these two distinguished\r\nwriters that Proudhon directed all the vitriol of his invective.\r\nIn George Sand’s work he would see nothing but _une orgueilleuse\r\nimpuissance_.[37] Daniel Stern,[38] because in her _Esquisses Morales_\r\nshe had ventured to maintain that woman need not necessarily be\r\ninferior to man, he decried as _une femme savante qui parle sans\r\nraison ni conscience_.[39]\r\n\r\nWrithing under these insults, Juliette went one evening to Mme.\r\nFauvety’s. There she said to Jenny d’Héricourt, “You ought to defend\r\nthe women who are thus insulted, you who know so well how to wield a\r\npen against the terrible Proudhon. It would be disgraceful to leave\r\nunanswered such abominable charges.”\r\n\r\n“George Sand and Daniel Stern,” replied this _vertu farouche_, “have\r\nonly what they deserve. I insist upon virtue and I practise it.\r\nProudhon has not dared to insult me, I am certain of it, though I have\r\nnot yet read his book.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Juliette. “I am nobody, it is true, although I am\r\nas virtuous as you, and I will reply to Proudhon. Women, they must be\r\ndefended by women.”\r\n\r\nThis esprit de corps, this loyalty not to her sex alone, but to\r\nany cause or party, political, social or religious with which she\r\nhas chosen to identify herself, has ever characterised Mme. Adam,\r\nand the conflict of her sense of solidarity with her innate Celtic\r\nrebelliousness is one of the most interesting traits in her psychology.\r\n\r\nThus bravely did this young woman of twenty-two take up the glove\r\nthrown down by the most eminent and the most skilful dialectician\r\nof the day. For two months she was absorbed in the writing of this,\r\nher first book. Most of the work was done at night. She would shut\r\nherself up in her room, where she was alone with little Alice.\r\nWhenever she found time to go to the Fauvety’s, M. Fauvety and M.\r\nRenouvier inquired eagerly after the progress of the great work. Mme.\r\nd’Héricourt continued scornful.\r\n\r\n“Well, and this defence of your famous friends, how is it getting on?”\r\nshe would inquire derisively. “If you succeed in carrying it through,\r\nGod send those great ladies be grateful to you, seeing all the pains\r\nyou seem to be taking.”[40]\r\n\r\n“Madame,” replied Juliette, “I am taking great pains. But then you\r\nmust remember I am but a novice; and you can’t expect one of my age to\r\nhave the experience of veterans.”\r\n\r\n“Veterans! Veterans!” cried the irate lady. “You mean me, doubtless.\r\nWell, if you defend some of us you are very impertinent to others.”\r\n\r\nFinally the book was finished, and entitled _Idées\r\nAnti-Proudhoniennes_. It was read to M. Fauvety, who approved and gave\r\nuseful advice. But to Juliette’s dismay he expressed a doubt whether a\r\nreply to so powerful an adversary, so acrimonious a controversialist,\r\nso consummate a master of dialectics would ever find a publisher.\r\n\r\nIn her passionate enthusiasm for her task, such a horrid fear had\r\nnever once entered Juliette’s mind.\r\n\r\n“What!” she cried, “my poor book which has devoured my nights will\r\nnever see day?”\r\n\r\n“You have made a _mot_,” replied the editor of _La Revue\r\nPhilosophique_, laughing. “But now you must captivate some great\r\npublisher. Don’t write, but offer your manuscript in person. Who\r\nknows? However, I doubt whether you will succeed when your book has\r\nbeen read.”\r\n\r\nSuch an opinion from so competent a critic would have discouraged most\r\nwriters. But Juliette, with a buoyant hopefulness which has ever\r\nsupported her throughout all the trials of her long career, was not\r\ndeterred. She merely concluded that such difficulties in the way of\r\npublication would involve her having to defray the expenses of the\r\nbook’s appearance. Consequently she went down to Chauny to demand her\r\nfather’s fulfilment of a rash promise that should she ever give birth\r\nto a volume he would pay for its publication.\r\n\r\n“I told him,” writes Juliette, “that I had written a book.” “What is\r\nit?” he asked, not unnaturally. But the subject of her book was the\r\nlast thing Juliette meant to reveal to this disciple of Proudhon. It\r\nwould seem a thing unheard of that Dr. Lambert should be asked to pay\r\nfor the publication of a book when he was ignorant of its contents.\r\nBut this was Juliette’s request; and she knew her father could refuse\r\nher nothing. She was encouraged, moreover, when she heard him express\r\nhis annoyance with the philosopher for his gross attacks on such\r\ndevoted republicans as George Sand and Daniel Stern. “You must have\r\nbeen sadly wounded, Juliette?” he inquired. “Yes, I was heart-broken,”\r\nshe replied. Yet she did not enlighten him any further. Nevertheless\r\nshe returned to Paris with the thousand francs, which her doting\r\nparent calculated would suffice for the publication of her literary\r\nfirst-born.\r\n\r\nThen followed the search for a publisher. Always ambitious, Juliette\r\napplied to one of the greatest publishing houses in the world. She\r\naddressed herself to M. Michel Lévy,[41] the publisher of Victor Hugo,\r\nof Sainte-Beuve, of Alexandre Dumas, who had recently discovered Renan\r\nin his garret. That famous master used to declare that Michel Lévy\r\nhad been ordained by a special decree of Providence to become his\r\npublisher. Such was not Juliette’s experience; for M. Lévy’s reception\r\nof her was, to put it mildly, not encouraging.[42]\r\n\r\n“Here is a young lady,” said his clerk, and in what a tone! “who\r\nhas come about a book she has written, which she wants the firm to\r\npublish.”\r\n\r\nSmiling, M. Lévy looked at his visitor and asked: “The subject of the\r\nbook?”\r\n\r\n“A reply to the attacks made on George Sand and Daniel Stern in _La\r\nJustice dans la Révolution_.”\r\n\r\n“And this reply is by you, mademoiselle?”\r\n\r\n“Madame, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And you think that a book like _this_ will be published by the house\r\nof Michel Lévy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir, I quite realise that I must bear the expense of the\r\npublication of my first book. If you would be so kind as to read it.”\r\n\r\n“Useless, madame.”\r\n\r\n“What! Do you decide without having looked at it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I can see perfectly what your ... work is like merely by looking\r\nat you. What do you think, my good Scholl?”[43] said he, addressing\r\nsome one who had just come in.\r\n\r\n“It would be a pity,” said Scholl, “for madame to become a commonplace\r\nblue-stocking. You are quite right to discourage her, my dear Lévy.\r\nShe has something better to do.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Aurélien Scholl,” replied Juliette proudly, “M. Huegel, near\r\nby, has published a poem[44] by me which may not be as good as your\r\n_Denise_, but my prose may quite well be equal to yours.”[45]\r\n\r\nAnd with her heart in her mouth, her literary personality, as she puts\r\nit, thoroughly humiliated, she left Michel Lévy’s office. Scholl, with\r\nwhom she was often to discuss that scene in after years, told her he\r\nhad advised Lévy to call her back.\r\n\r\nThough for the moment her hopes were all dashed to the ground,\r\nJuliette was unconquered. Her courage has ever been roused by\r\nopposition. And M. Lévy’s impertinence had provided her with a further\r\nincentive to succeed: she desired ardently to prove him in the wrong.\r\nSo she continued her search for a publisher; and always it was the\r\nleaders of the publishing world whom she visited. No less than eight\r\ndid she approach, not omitting even Proudhon’s own publisher. He\r\nwas extremely polite, but he said: “You will understand, madame,\r\nthat such things are not done.” At that time Hetzel, one of the most\r\nliterary of Paris publishers, was in exile at Brussels. Juliette wrote\r\nto him. He replied:[46] “Either your book is very bad or you use a\r\ncoloured handkerchief, and possibly you take snuff. I can’t believe\r\na woman, who is probably ugly and certainly middle-aged, can have\r\nany right to defend against Proudhon the youth of George Sand and\r\nDaniel Stern or their position in the world. You would expose them to\r\nridicule, and they would never forgive you. For doubtless Proudhon\r\nwould reply to you.”\r\n\r\nHere was a dilemma. What was Juliette to do? Evidently none of the\r\nrecognised publishers would even read her MS., for they all either\r\nfound her too pretty or suspected her of being plain.\r\n\r\nOn the ground floor of her house in the Rue de Rivoli was a\r\nbookseller, Taride by name, of whom Juliette was an excellent\r\ncustomer. She took him into her confidence. Would he publish her book\r\nif she stood all the expense? “Why not, madame?” he replied. “We\r\nneither of us run any risk, for we are both unknown, and if we fail,\r\nno one will hear of it.”\r\n\r\nConsequently, Juliette put down eight hundred francs, and the book\r\nappeared, in defiance of the bookseller’s advice, in the summer, on\r\nthe 15th of August, when, as the saying went, there was not “a cat in\r\nParis.” But the impatient young authoress, whose hopes had been so\r\nlong delayed, refused to wait until the autumn.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of the month Juliette installed herself in the\r\nbookseller’s back shop, and inscribed on the fly-leaves of fifty\r\ncopies suitable dedications to the most important figures in the world\r\nof journalism and letters: George Sand, Daniel Stern, Littré, Émile de\r\nGirardin, Prosper Mérimée, Edmond About, Octave Feuillet, Jules Grévy,\r\nHippolyte Carnot and others. Then dispatching an errand-boy with the\r\ncelebrities’ copies, she herself took a cab and delivered the books at\r\nthe newspaper offices.\r\n\r\nThis done, her next concern was to go down to Chauny and put a volume\r\ninto her father’s hands. What would he say to her impudence in\r\nattacking so great a philosopher, to her _Idées Anti-Proudhoniennes_?\r\nAnd, indeed, the title was a shock to him. He took the little volume\r\nin his hand, turned it round and round. “What if it’s bad?” he began.\r\n“But if it’s good?” interposed Juliette. “Ah, at your age, even if you\r\nhave half a success, you are distinguished for life.”[47]\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, finding her very agitated, he sent her to bed. “_Va te\r\ncoucher, Basile_,” he said. “I will read your book to-night, and tell\r\nyou what I think of it in the morning.”\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock in the morning he came into his daughter’s room\r\nand awakened her with the words:[48] “It is good, it is good.\r\nBut it is mine. I sowed the seed in your mind of these _Idées\r\nAnti-Proudhoniennes_. My dear child, this means your success, your\r\nsalvation,[49] influential friendships, your grandmother’s wishes\r\nrealised. Why is she not here at this moment?”\r\n\r\nThe next morning at breakfast even the usually despondent Mme. Lambert\r\nwas gay, although she could not help her customary gloom breaking out\r\nin the exclamation, “I tremble to think what a life of work and worry\r\nthis will mean for you.”\r\n\r\nDr. Lambert was eager for his daughter to be off to Paris, there to\r\nreceive the congratulations which he was convinced were awaiting\r\nher. And he was not mistaken. Every day brought some new proof of\r\nthe attention this little volume had attracted. The book was widely\r\nnoticed in the press. The review which pleased her most, even to the\r\npoint, she confesses, of for the moment making her lose her head (_cet\r\narticle me monta un peu à la tête_),[50] was by Eugène Pelletan, in\r\n_La Presse_. The writer came to see her the day after the article’s\r\nappearance: and from that moment he became one of her most faithful\r\nand devoted friends. The _Siècle_, the periodical which had published\r\nher first prose effort,[51] in the following terms noticed her volume\r\nonly a few days after its publication—\r\n\r\n“We received yesterday a book destined to produce a profound\r\nsensation. It is a reply to Proudhon and to the insulting attack upon\r\nGeorge Sand and Daniel Stern contained in his last work. This book,\r\ndespite its virility, is said to be by a very young woman. The title\r\nof the volume is _Idées Anti-Proudhoniennes_. It is signed ‛Juliette\r\nLamessine.’”\r\n\r\nVirility is, indeed, the dominating feature of this, Juliette’s first\r\nproduction, as it was to be of all her work. She writes as one having\r\nauthority. Her style is crisp, terse, dramatic, vivid and, above\r\nall, forcible. It is essentially the style of a woman of action as\r\nwell as of thought. In controversy she has always been at her best.\r\nAnd she could not possibly have found a subject better suited to her\r\ntemperament and training than this answer to Proudhon’s attack on\r\nwomen. That in this year, 1858, three years before John Stuart Mill\r\nbegan to write his _Subjection of Women_, three years before our first\r\nwoman doctor, Mrs. Garrett Anderson, began to study medicine, a young\r\nwoman of twenty-two should have been able to present a bird’s-eye\r\nview of the whole field of feminist reform; that she should, in such\r\nforcible terms, have enunciated feminist principles and contended for\r\nthose rights which it has required half a century of conflict to win,\r\nwas a very remarkable achievement.\r\n\r\nThis little book of one hundred and ninety-six pages, polished off in\r\ntwo months, naturally makes no pretence at being an adequate answer to\r\nProudhon’s great work, the result of years of laborious effort. It is,\r\nindeed, only with the last part of the book, that treating of women\r\nand of marriage, that the authoress of _Idées Anti-Proudhoniennes_ is\r\nconcerned. “Therein,” she writes, “are things which every woman who\r\nknows how to hold a pen has the right to regard as personal insults,\r\nand it is to these personalities that I intend to reply.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in her first chapter, entitled “Generalities,” she\r\npermits herself a few remarks on the main trend of her adversary’s\r\nbook. She blames the narrow dogmatism which blinds him to the\r\ncomplexity of the social problem. A pure economist, this founder of\r\nthe People’s Bank had attempted to solve the social problem in terms\r\nof pounds, shillings and pence. This Proudhon was the J. A. Hobson\r\nof that day. His absorption in the idea of justice caused him to\r\nforget what is equally important, passion, affection, solidarity and\r\nmercy. “There is no heart in your dialectics,” writes Juliette. “Now\r\nto understand life, you must be yourself alive. Had you the most\r\npowerful brain in the universe, you would never comprehend man and\r\nhumanity.”\r\n\r\n“Justice,” wrote Proudhon, “had been nothing, it must be everything.”\r\nBut for this hide-bound economist justice could exist only between man\r\nand man, for all men should be equal; but between man and woman, who\r\nmust ever be unequal, justice need not be considered, for man must\r\never dominate woman. And why? Because man regarded as a working member\r\nof the community is more productive than woman, who is physically,\r\nintellectually and morally man’s inferior. Such an argument gives us\r\npause in these days of the Great War, when manufacturers are telling\r\nus that the average output of women in factories is twenty per cent.\r\nhigher than that of men.\r\n\r\nWoman, man’s inferior physically, maintains Proudhon, must necessarily\r\nbe mentally his inferior also. For physical strength is no less\r\nnecessary to the work of the mind than to the work of the body. Here\r\nthe retort was obvious; and we may be sure Proudhon’s young opponent\r\ndid not miss it. “What, M. Proudhon,” she rejoins; “then a porter will\r\nbe a better thinker than a philosopher. M. Proudhon’s God is obviously\r\nthe dynamometer.... Force, always force. In force lies the millennium.\r\nThat was the opinion of the Prætorian Guard when they chose for\r\nemperor the great Maximin, because he was stronger than a horse.”\r\n\r\nInstead of the subjection of woman to man, which Proudhon maintains\r\nto be inevitable, his young adversary contends that the progress of\r\nsociety requires that men and women shall work together as equals.\r\n“A mere glance at the history of mankind,” she argues, “will suffice\r\nto show that among nations civilisation is in proportion to the\r\npart played by woman, to her influence, to her moral worth; and, as\r\ncivilisation increases, the greater will be the value set upon the\r\nposition accorded to woman.” This is an argument which no profound\r\nobserver of human nature could deny. Unless men and women laugh\r\ntogether you cannot have that true comedy which is the very salt of\r\nthe intellectual life, was the opinion of George Meredith.[52] “Where\r\nthe veil is over women’s faces,” he wrote, referring to the silence\r\nof comedy among Eastern peoples, “you cannot have society, without\r\nwhich the senses are barbarous, and the comic spirit is driven to the\r\ngutters of grossness to slake its thirst.” _Nous avons débrutalisé la\r\nsociété française_ was the proudest boast of Juliette’s forerunner, La\r\nMarquise de Rambouillet, foundress of the first great French salon.\r\n\r\nMme. Lamessine was one of the earliest French women writers to divine\r\nthat which this war is proving: woman’s capacity for work, for which\r\nher asserted inferiority to man had been held to unfit her.\r\n\r\nAnticipating John Stuart Mill, Mme. Lamessine demanded that all\r\nthe liberal professions should be thrown open to women, and that\r\nwomen should be admitted to a share, if not in the legislation at\r\nleast in the administration, of their country. The rôle of mayoress\r\nshe considered particularly appropriate to women. She demanded the\r\nadmission of women to those _conseils de prud’hommes_ which in France\r\nregulate disputes between employers and employed.\r\n\r\n“_O Nazaréen incorrigible!_” she exclaims, when her adversary falls\r\na prey to the ancient myth that woman is ever the source of evil and\r\nthe mother of impurity. “Men who, like M. Proudhon,” she continues,\r\n“desire to restore the patriarchate by imprisoning women in the family\r\nare _des abstractions de quintessence_ who are blind to all that is\r\ngoing on around them, who misjudge the collective life which is daily\r\ndeveloping new needs, engendering new forces, and giving rise to\r\nsocial institutions responding to these needs and organising these\r\nforces. They mean well, doubtless, and they think they are serving\r\nthe cause of progress, or at least of morality, which always comes to\r\nbe that of progress. By compelling woman to shut herself up in her\r\nfamily, by limiting her to the rôle of wife and mother, they hope to\r\nput an end to her growing passion for luxury and dissipation.... But\r\nthey are mistaken. It is not by limiting the scope of her activity\r\nthat they will arrest this disorder, but rather by opening up new\r\nchannels for the wholesome play of her energy. Women must be educated\r\nthoroughly, and, wherever it is possible, professionally. They must\r\nbe made productive. Work alone has emancipated man. Work alone can\r\nemancipate woman. Let woman provide herself by honest work with\r\nclothes which will adorn and become her. Then, instead of dragging in\r\nthe dust of the pavement her lace shawls and her silk skirts, she\r\nwill walk free and proud in the modesty of clothes which will reveal\r\nher beauty, without tarnishing her virtue or selling her honour....\r\n\r\n“But do not let me be accused of undervaluing woman’s rôle in the\r\nfamily: I, like Proudhon, believe that a woman’s first duty is to be\r\nwife and mother. But I maintain that family life need not absorb all\r\nwoman’s activities, physical, moral and intellectual. The part of a\r\nbroody hen is honourable without doubt, but it is not suited to every\r\none, neither is it so absorbing as it is represented.”\r\n\r\nIn Juliette’s childhood her father had given her a catechism embodying\r\nthe principles of democratic socialism. Now in the last pages of this\r\nbook she expressed in another catechism her views of society and of\r\nwomen’s rôle in it.\r\n\r\nThe question of the parliamentary franchise Mme. Lamessine did not\r\ndiscuss in this volume. It is obvious that so ardent an advocate of\r\nsex equality must have believed in woman’s right to vote. Woman’s\r\nsuffrage, we remember, was one of the reforms demanded by the\r\nMlles. André’s pupils when, in 1848, Juliette marshalled them in\r\nthe playground at Chauny beneath the banner of her father’s social\r\ndemocratic handkerchief. But the so-called universal, in reality\r\nmanhood, suffrage of 1851 had led to the Empire, and Mme. Lamessine\r\nabhorred the Empire: henceforth therefore she placed no great faith\r\nin the people’s vote, not even if, as she believed, in all justice it\r\nshould do, the people included women.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] The edition from which I quote is that of 1870 in four volumes.\r\nThe suppressed edition of 1858, according to Mme.

Juliette’s book brought her influential\r\nfriendships and distinguished acquaintances. It flung her right into\r\nthe whirl of Parisian literary and political society.\r\n\r\nThe two women writers, whom _Idées Anti-Proudhoniennes_ had defended,\r\nboth wrote to thank their young champion. Of George Sand’s letter\r\nand of the friendship which some years later ensued between her and\r\nJuliette we shall hear much in another chapter. La Comtesse d’Agoult\r\n(Daniel Stern), after having read Juliette’s book, wrote to her—\r\n\r\n“It is surprising, sir, that you should have assumed a woman’s name,\r\nwhile we women write under masculine pseudonyms.”[53]\r\n\r\n“I replied to her,” writes Juliette, “that I was a woman, and very\r\nmuch a woman.”\r\n\r\nThen there followed an invitation to one of the great lady’s evenings.\r\nThis was a high honour. For Mme. d’Agoult’s salon in the Rue Presbourg\r\nwas not only the centre of the Republican opposition to the Empire, it\r\nwas a brilliant and cosmopolitan assembly, a meeting-place for many\r\nof the most distinguished men of the day. Renan, Littré and Émile de\r\nGirardin, here foregathered with Emerson, Heine and Kossuth. The life\r\nof Mme. d’Agoult herself had been as eventful as that of any of her\r\nguests. Born at Frankfort in 1805, she was the daughter of a German\r\nbanker’s daughter and the Comte de Flavigny, a French _emigré_, who\r\nhad been page to Marie Antoinette. When the Revolution had subsided,\r\nthe Comte de Flavigny brought his wife and his daughter, Marie, back\r\nto France. Marie soon grew into an intelligent and beautiful girl\r\nof Germanic type—tall, golden-haired and blue-eyed. Having set her\r\nheart upon a man who married some one else, she refused offer after\r\noffer until well on in what was then regarded as spinsterhood. At the\r\nage of twenty-two she submitted to a _mariage de convenance_ with\r\nthe Comte d’Agoult. In a loveless life she found consolation in that\r\njoy of every clever Parisienne’s heart, the creation of a salon. She\r\ndelighted to gather the élite of the aristocracy round her in her town\r\nhouse on the Quai Malaquais, facing the Louvre, or in her country\r\nchâteau of Croissy, fifteen miles out of Paris. Soon this “Corinne\r\nof the Quai Malaquais,” as she was called, became one of the most\r\nattractive of Parisian hostesses. She aspired even to emulate the\r\nseductive Mme. Récamier, whose salon at L’Abbaye-aux-Bois was then\r\nat the height of its glory. But the Comtesse realised that without\r\n_le grand homme_, in other words, without a literary lion, a salon is\r\nnothing. Mme. Récamier had her Chateaubriand. Mme. d’Agoult selected\r\nfor her “great man” the poet, Alfred de Vigny. So, while Chateaubriand\r\nwas entrancing Mme. Récamier’s guests by the reading of his _Mémoires\r\nd’Outre Tombe_, the Countess invited her friend, Alfred de Vigny, to\r\nread his new poem, _La Frégate_, to an assembly of ambassadresses,\r\nduchesses, and countesses at Croissy. But alas! de Vigny, though a\r\ngifted poet, was no reader. And the chilling silence at the end of\r\nthe reading was broken by the freezing question: “Is your friend an\r\namateur, madame?” “Decidedly,” said de Vigny to his hostess, “my\r\nfrigate has been shipwrecked in your salon.”\r\n\r\nBut a worse shipwreck than that of _La Frégate_ was to attend the fair\r\nchâtelaine of Croissy. Some one had described this statuesque beauty\r\nin terms she herself found _not_ inaccurate as “six inches of snow on\r\ntwenty feet of lava.” And the lava was soon to melt the snow. Mme.\r\nd’Agoult’s apparent coldness vanished before the noontide heat of an\r\nirresistible attraction, that of the most fatal Don Juan of Europe,\r\nnone other than the musician, Franz Liszt, who had already melted many\r\na distinguished feminine heart.\r\n\r\nCasting to the winds her social reputation, her marriage vows, and her\r\nmaternal affection (she had borne the Comte d’Agoult two children),\r\nshe suffered herself to be carried off from a ball, and spent the next\r\nyears of her life wandering over Europe with her lover.\r\n\r\nThen, having quarrelled with Liszt, she returned to Paris in 1846, and\r\nsettled down, in the Rue Presbourg, to write under the pseudonym of\r\n“Daniel Stern.”\r\n\r\nOf course all the doors of her aristocratic friends in the Faubourg\r\nSt. Germain were closed against her. But even before her flight she\r\nhad made some friends in the _bourgeoisie_; and among them were M. and\r\nMme. Émile de Girardin. Mme. de Girardin, the Countess had known when,\r\nas the clever and beautiful Delphine Gay, she was the poetess laureate\r\nof the Restoration. Now, married to Émile de Girardin, the Lord\r\nNorthcliffe of that day, Delphine was one of the most successful of\r\nParisian hostesses. While her mysterious husband, that Napoléon of the\r\nPress, that _homme fatal_, of whose origin no one was sure, muffled\r\nhimself in a shawl and slumbered in a corner of the salon until such\r\ntime as he should go to his newspaper,[54] the vivacious Mme. de\r\nGirardin gathered round her all the great literary celebrities of the\r\nhour, Lamartine, Victor Hugo, Balzac, Théophile Gautier and Eugène\r\nSue. And in this brilliant circle, the Countess, ostracised elsewhere,\r\nwas made warmly welcome. Here she formed her Republican opinions, here\r\nshe came into contact with the leading figures of that Revolution of\r\n1848, of which she was to become the historian.[55] Here, in Mme. de\r\nGirardin’s salon in the Rue Lafitte, the Countess replenished her\r\nemptied visiting-list and gathered material for her second salon.\r\n\r\nWith most of this story Juliette had become acquainted through the\r\ngossip of Mme. Fauvety’s drawing-room. And what she did not already\r\nknow was told her by Mme. d’Agoult’s friend, de Ronchaud, whom the\r\nCountess had sent to escort the young Mme. Lamessine to the Rue\r\nPresbourg. Mme. d’Agoult could not have assigned Juliette a more\r\ncongenial cavalier. De Ronchaud was a fervent classicist, one of the\r\nfounders of that new Hellenic school which was just then coming into\r\nprominence. His delightful talk about Greek art in the book-shop\r\nof Père France on the Quai Voltaire had seduced young Anatole into\r\nplaying truant from the Collège Stanislas in order to spend a whole\r\nday wandering through the Galerie des Antiques in the Louvre. Juliette\r\nfound de Ronchaud’s conversation equally entrancing. “Our first talk,”\r\nshe writes, “was one long hymn to Greece.” De Ronchaud promised to\r\nintroduce his young friend to other Hellenists, and he foretold that\r\ntogether they would bring about a second Renaissance.\r\n\r\nWhat an all-important event was Juliette’s first evening in Mme.\r\nd’Agoult’s salon may easily be imagined. She found the Countess,\r\nlike many other distinguished Frenchwomen, anticipating her age, for\r\nalthough she was only fifty-three, she wore over her silver hair a\r\nlight black lace mantilla. At the first glance she gave Juliette\r\nthe impression of strength, almost virile, and yet of femininity.\r\n“_J’ai atteint l’âge d’homme_,” she used to say, echoing Catherine of\r\nRussia’s sentiment when she welcomed Diderot with the words: “As man\r\nto man we can discuss anything.” Tall and superbly graceful, it seemed\r\nto Juliette that she had never seen a more complete great lady. When\r\nMme. d’Agoult described herself as a Democrat, it was difficult to\r\nsuppress a smile, so anomalous on her lips sounded such a word. Her\r\nbearing, the pose of her head, her features, the lines of her face\r\nwhich betrayed no trace of the tempestuous passion that had swept over\r\nher in youth; everything about Mme. d’Agoult was aristocratic.\r\n\r\nIn the general conversation of her salon the Countess took little\r\npart, but, seated on the right of the fireplace, she would carry on\r\na _tête-à-tête_ with some single person. Unlike many another salon\r\nlady, Mme. du Deffand or Mme. de Staël or Juliette herself, she was no\r\nmaker of _mots_; nor was she ready with repartee. She herself could\r\nnever understand how she came by her reputation of a wit;[56] for she\r\nknew that she never appeared at her best in conversation. She was too\r\nreserved, too self-conscious to be a vivacious talker, and she could\r\nonly be eloquent when intense feeling took her out of herself.[57]\r\n\r\nGrave and a trifle solemn, her salon was frequented by serious\r\nstudents, such as Littré, who rarely went anywhere else, as well as\r\nby more sociable philosophers like Renan. The subjects discussed were\r\npolitics, philosophy, art (music especially), serious literature, but\r\nseldom plays or novels. The guests were too addicted to monologue; and\r\ntoo often some weighty personage, leaning against the mantel-piece\r\nwould discourse at such length that his talk became a veritable\r\nlecture. Sometimes Mme. d’Agoult would read a letter from some foreign\r\ncorrespondent, a famous revolutionary like Mazzini or Kossuth; for she\r\nhad relations with the whole of Europe, including those illustrious\r\nFrenchmen whom Louis Napoléon’s _coup d’état_ of December 1851 had\r\ndriven into exile.\r\n\r\nThough all Mme. d’Agoult’s friends were republicans and therefore\r\nopposed to the Empire, they were not all agreed as to the best way of\r\nconducting the opposition. About this year, 1858, two distinct parties\r\nwere beginning to define themselves: the extreme republicans who,\r\nlike Juliette and her father, believed in keeping entirely aloof from\r\nimperial politics, and who regarded as traitors to Republicanism any\r\nwho should, no matter for what purpose, consent to swear allegiance\r\nto the Emperor. These uncompromising anti-imperialists went by the\r\nname of _abstentionistes_. But there was also coming into existence\r\na more moderate party led by Mme. d’Agoult’s son-in-law, Émile\r\nOllivier.[58] They held that opposition to the Empire could be most\r\neffectively carried out by entering the Corps Legislatif, for which\r\nit was necessary to take the oath of allegiance. This party, known as\r\n_sermentistes_, was to grow in strength until it succeeded in forcing\r\nits so-called Liberalism on the Emperor, and establishing what is\r\nknown as _L’Empire Libéral_.\r\n\r\nJuliette’s uncompromising nature, as we have seen, made it impossible\r\nfor her to approve of the _Sermentistes_. And she loses no opportunity\r\nof ridiculing _les petits Olliviers_, as Ollivier’s followers were\r\ncalled, when they appeared in Mme. d’Agoult’s salon. Indeed, the\r\nCountess herself opposed her son-in-law’s policy; and, after her\r\ndaughter’s death, there was an open breach between them.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first the pretty, vivacious Mme. Lamessine made a highly\r\nfavourable impression on Mme. d’Agoult. “She took the trouble,” writes\r\nJuliette, “to convert a little provincial into a society lady.[59]\r\nShe encouraged me to talk of my work. When you are perplexed, come and\r\ntell me,” she would say. “I shall be delighted to give you the benefit\r\nof my observation of mankind and of all I have learnt in the hard\r\nschool of experience.”\r\n\r\nSoon Juliette’s invitation to the Countess’s evenings was extended to\r\nthose smaller intimate parties, which met around the luncheon or the\r\ndinner-table. On these occasions the Hellenist, Louis de Ronchaud, was\r\nalmost invariably her fellow-guest.\r\n\r\nMme. d’Agoult laughed at Juliette’s passion for antiquity. “My\r\ndear child,” she would say, “you must be of your time. At your age\r\nyou ought not to be so _antique_.... I shall take you to the Opéra\r\nBouffes” (the Italian theatre). “That will modernise you a little.”\r\n\r\n“For the love of Greece, remain Greek,” pleaded de Ronchaud. But,\r\nindeed, there was no fear of the Opéra Bouffes perverting Juliette\r\nfrom Hellenism; for Offenbach’s caricaturing of her Homeric deities\r\nin _Orphée aux Enfers_ so outraged her Grecian sympathies that\r\nMme. d’Agoult was constrained to make amends by inviting her to a\r\nneo-Grecian dinner. “It will be a pagan party,” the Countess said.\r\n“De Ronchaud has arranged it.” The other guests were two brilliant\r\nHellenists, Ménard and Saint Victor. They began by discussing the now\r\nmuch-disputed importance of a classical education. These neo-Grecians\r\nwere firmly persuaded that the classics alone can inculcate those\r\nsuperior ideas of justice and heroism, which are all the more salutary\r\nbecause for ages they have permeated the race. Naturally they lamented\r\nover what seemed to them the decadence of French society under the\r\nEmpire. Ménard maintained that periods of intellectual decadence are\r\ninvariably periods of mechanical progress and of political despotism.\r\n\r\nThen the worshippers of ancient Hellas fell with equal zest and\r\nvivacity to discussing the antiquity of the Orphic mysteries.\r\n\r\nHow intensely alive for Juliette was this Hellenic past she has proved\r\nover and over again in her literary work, and most notably in three\r\nnovels she was to produce some years later, _Laide_ (1878), _Grecque_\r\n(1879), and _Païenne_ (1883).[60]\r\n\r\nThat great wave of philosophic speculation which was sweeping through\r\nFrance could not fail to affect so intellectual a salon as Mme.\r\nd’Agoult’s. An earlier dinner-party, Juliette’s first at the Rue\r\nPresbourg, had been a veritable symposium of philosophers. The great\r\nLittré,[61] the eloquent exponent of Comte’s philosophy, was the lion\r\nof the evening. His famous _Etymological Dictionary of the French\r\nLanguage_ was then going through the Press.\r\n\r\n“Littré,” writes Juliette, “inspired me with a sentiment which was\r\nalmost worship.” When they had met before they had talked of Greece.\r\nThe editor of Hippocrates and Pliny, though laughing at his young\r\nfriend’s fervent passion for ancient Hellas, had been able to reveal\r\nto her things in the _Iliad_ which neither she nor her father had\r\ndreamed of.\r\n\r\nAmong the other guests were De Ronchaud, of course; Hippolyte\r\nCarnot, son of the “Organiser of Victory,” and editor of one of\r\nthe leading magazines of the day, _La Revue Encyclopédique_;[62]\r\nDupont-White, the friend of John Stuart Mill, a bold thinker and an\r\nardent apologist of centralisation in government. In the presence\r\nof such an august philosophic trio Juliette for the first part of\r\nthe dinner was content to listen; and we may be sure that, like her\r\nillustrious namesake, Mme. Récamier, she listened “with seduction.”\r\nBut towards the end of the evening we find her warmed to take part in\r\nthe discussion. Although she admired, almost worshipped Littré, she\r\ncould not tolerate his positivism. Positivism suggested Comte, and\r\nComte suggested the husband whose conduct was rendering her domestic\r\nlife unbearable. But Littré seemed to her to out-Comte even Comte;\r\nfor Littré would stifle the slightest breath of idealism. While Comte\r\nadmitted that there are as many arguments for as against the existence\r\nof an unknowable, Littré seemed to Juliette absolutely to deny it.\r\nThis may have been so at that time; but surely Littré must later have\r\nbecome less dogmatic. For we remember Paul Bourget’s description of\r\n“Old Littré” as a saint who spoke eloquently of that ocean of mystery\r\nwashing our very shores, but over the waters of which we have no\r\nbarque to carry us.[63]\r\n\r\nWhen Littré maintained that as “light cannot exist without a luminous\r\nbody, neither can life without organs nor spirit without matter,”\r\nJuliette protested that vehicles are not essences. “The Homeric past,”\r\nshe added, “presents us with a poetic conception of things which\r\nencourages the belief that the future has something better in store\r\nthan your immutable law and its brutality.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I agree,” replied Littré, “the immutable law is brutal in its\r\npartial manifestations, but its general action, based on the unvarying\r\nconditions of proportion and order, inspires us with the idea of\r\nabsolute justice.”\r\n\r\nAgainst such determinism Juliette revolted with all the fervour of her\r\nrebellious and romantic soul.\r\n\r\n“I protest,” she said. “If I feel myself a mere atom of dust swept\r\nabout by the wind and not an intelligence dominating matter, why\r\nshould I make any effort?”\r\n\r\n“Because action is the law of humanity.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! but for me belief in man led by the spirit and nature by the\r\ndivine is a necessity.” Here, in these words indicating so plainly the\r\nwish to believe, lies the key to Juliette’s whole mental and spiritual\r\nevolution. It was a key which her philosopher friends were quick to\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\n“We shall see this pagan turning Christian,” said Littré.\r\n\r\n“And I should not be at all sorry,” remarked Mme. d’Agoult, “if it\r\nwere only for the pleasure of exasperating that Hellenising Ronchaud.”\r\n\r\nJuliette and her hostess would appear to have been the only women\r\nat these dinner-parties. There may have been others, whom Juliette\r\ndoes not mention. But Mme. d’Agoult was essentially a man’s woman.\r\nThe wives of her guests, with very few exceptions, did not interest\r\nher. There were, however, a few clever and distinguished women who\r\nfrequented her salon. There was the masculine Mme. Royer, who was\r\nas much of a blue-stocking as her friend Jenny d’Héricourt, and\r\nwhom Juliette equally detested; there was the heroic Mme. Hippolyte\r\nCarnot, the Cornelia of French republicans, who, when her husband was\r\nresisting Louis Napoléon in December 1851, said, “If you die you will\r\nbequeath to your sons the example you inherited from your father.”\r\nThen there was that queen of _raconteuses_, the witty but rather\r\nRabelaisian Comtesse de Pierreclos, the poet Lamartine’s niece. This\r\ntall and powerfully-built lady, with large prominent features, was\r\none of the most striking figures in salon society. She was pleased to\r\njoke about her own appearance. Being asked what part she would take\r\nin a play, she replied, “I think mine should be the part of the bust\r\nof Louis Philippe.” But if other people attempted to make fun of her\r\nshe resented it strongly. Thus when she said she had met a certain\r\nperson face to face, which in French is “nose to nose,” and some one\r\nejaculated, “Then it must have been yours that conquered,” she was on\r\nthe point of bursting into tears.[64] But Mme. de Pierreclos passed\r\nas quick as lightning from tears to laughter. She and Juliette were\r\nequally exuberant and impulsive. Perhaps it was this that made them\r\nsworn friends. They corresponded regularly, and during Juliette’s\r\nfrequent absences from Paris she depended on her friend to keep her\r\n_au courant_ with all the doings of the metropolis, with the latest\r\n_mot_, the last scandal, the newest play and the best music.\r\n\r\nFor Juliette’s interests were far from being concentrated on\r\nphilosophy or even on neo-Hellenism. Plays, picture-shows, fancy-dress\r\nballs and the opera crowded her days, leaving her, one might have\r\nthought, no time for literary work. Nevertheless, she had contrived\r\nbefore 1863 to produce a novel, _Le Mandarin_, three volumes of short\r\nstories, _Mon Village_, _Récits d’une Paysanne_, _Voyage autour du\r\nGrand Pin_, besides pamphlets on public questions and newspaper\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JULIETTE LAMBERT\r\n\r\nFrom a portrait by Léopold Flameng, 1860]\r\n\r\nAmong all these various pleasures and duties one wonders what became\r\nof Juliette’s little daughter Alice. The child was now old enough to\r\nnotice the strained relations between her parents, and in order to\r\nremove her from the unedifying disputes between her mother and father,\r\nAlice had been sent to her grandparents at Chauny.\r\n\r\nAs far as her literary and social life was concerned Juliette’s most\r\nambitious dreams were about to be realised. She was on the way to\r\nbecome a queen of society. True, she had enemies, chiefly pedants\r\nlike Mme. d’Héricourt and Mlle. Royer, or the friends of Proudhon.\r\nNo one so convinced, so outspoken as Juliette could avoid arousing\r\nopposition. But, with the exception of that little coterie, all\r\nhearts were hers, won by her good nature, her charm, her genius for\r\nfriendship, her vivacity, her intelligence and her loveliness.\r\n\r\nA leading French journalist, now no longer living, who followed Mme.\r\nAdam’s career with interest and admiration, told me that in her youth\r\nshe was entrancingly beautiful. Referring to the salon she was shortly\r\nto establish, to the princes, ambassadors, writers and artists who\r\ncrowded round the brilliant young hostess, that journalist said: “We\r\nwere all in love with her.”\r\n\r\nMoreover Juliette, though an advocate of the rights of woman in\r\ndays when feminists tended to affect masculine attire, discarded\r\nnone of her femininity. It has always been her opinion that _Pour\r\nune femme, c’est une infériorité que se deféminiser_. She who had\r\nbeen independent enough to abstain from the crinoline, knew how to\r\ndress. One of her gowns, velvet _gorge de tourterelle_, with large\r\nsteel buttons, worn at Alphonse Daudet’s dinner-party, made such an\r\nimpression on Edmond de Goncourt that he described it in detail, in\r\nthe pages of that Journal which has now become a classic.[65]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that more than one distinguished artist—Flameng,\r\nCharpentier, for example—painted Mme. Lamessine’s portrait.\r\nCharpentier’s picture was exhibited in the salon. Mme. d’Agoult’s\r\nfriend, the famous sculptor, Adam Salomon, photographed her in a\r\nCharlotte Corday costume, which she had worn at a fancy-dress ball,\r\nand wished to model her bust. The photograph was a success, not so\r\nthe bust. After having made many attempts in clay, the sculptor gave\r\nit up. Some time later, however, when Mme. Lamessine was in his\r\nstudio, he persuaded her to let him take a caste of her face. “It was\r\nhorrible,” she writes.[66] “I thought I should have been suffocated;\r\nand I felt as if my eyebrows and eyelashes were being torn off. The\r\nagony of those few seconds when Adam Salomon was piercing holes for\r\nmy nostrils and making slits for my lips, when I could hardly breath,\r\npursued me for months.” “I quite understand,” she adds, “that a cast\r\nof the head and face is not usually taken until after death.”\r\n\r\nIt was at the Adam Salomons’ that Juliette met Lamartine. He came\r\nthere every day: and it saddened her to see this great poet worried\r\nby financial embarrassments and attempting to retrieve his fallen\r\nfortunes by soliciting subscriptions to his _Cours Familier de\r\nLittérature. Ce pauvre Lamartine_, wrote the witty Mme. Mohl, _ce\r\nn’est plus une lyre, c’est une tire-lire_ (a sealed earthen pot with a\r\nslit into which a peasant puts his money). The poet’s fine, handsome\r\ncountenance still lit up when he spoke of art, letters or politics,\r\nbut that unhappily was but seldom.[67]\r\n\r\nThere are those for whom socially the Second Empire signifies\r\nlittle more than hollow splendour, ostentatious display and vulgar\r\nluxury. No doubt these tendencies were strongly marked; but at the\r\nsame time there flourished a rich and original development of art,\r\nmusic and literature. When Juliette was making her _début_ in Paris\r\ndrawing-rooms, Alexandre Dumas’ _La Dame aux Camélias_ and his _Fils\r\nNaturel_ were being played at Le Théâtre Français, Millet and Puvis\r\nde Chavannes were exhibiting their first pictures in the Salon, Renan\r\nwas writing his _Vie de Jésus_, Erckmann and Chatrian their Napoleonic\r\nromances, and Victor Hugo, in exile, his _Légende des Siècles_.\r\nThose were the days when two of the greatest composers of the modern\r\nworld, Berlioz and Wagner, were rivalling one another on the Parisian\r\noperatic stage.\r\n\r\nJuliette first met Berlioz at the representation of _Orpheo_ at the\r\nThéâtre Lyrique. Mme. Viardot’s sublime rendering of the part of\r\nOrpheo avenged Juliette and her neo-Grecian friends, Ménard and de\r\nRonchaud, who accompanied her, for the insults Offenbach had offered\r\nto their Greek gods. During the song “I have lost my Eurydice,”\r\nJuliette, overcome by emotion, paid the singer the superb compliment\r\nof momentarily losing consciousness. When Berlioz himself came round\r\nto their box at the end of the act, Ménard did not neglect to tell him\r\nof the beautiful Mme. Lamessine’s little swoon. Highly flattered the\r\ncomposer took her hand in his and kept it there.[68]\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “it is quite beautiful.... Orpheo is near enough to\r\nthe real Orpheo for the expression of grief rendered as we have just\r\nheard it to overwhelm the senses.”\r\n\r\nJuliette appreciated Wagner’s art, though she was far too much of a\r\nLatin to prefer this Teuton to Berlioz. “Berlioz,” she wrote, “is the\r\ninitiator, he stands above all others. He can well afford to let the\r\nWagnerian fanatics assert that Wagner’s is the music of the future.”\r\n\r\nJuliette first met Wagner and heard him play at the Comtesse de\r\nCharnacé’s. The Comtesse was Mme. d’Agoult’s daughter by her husband,\r\nthe Comte d’Agoult, and, strangely enough it may seem to us, she was\r\nin the habit of receiving her half-sister, daughter of Liszt and Mme.\r\nd’Agoult, and wife of the celebrated pianist, Hans von Bülow. Von\r\nBülow was Wagner’s shadow; and it was Von Bülow who brought Wagner to\r\nthe Rue Vaugirard. About twenty-five people were present. Juliette\r\nthought Wagner’s enormous head not lacking in character, at least the\r\nupper part of it. His forehead was broad and high. His questioning\r\neyes were now tender, now hard; but his ugly mouth, with its sarcastic\r\nexpression, seemed to press back his cheeks and like nut-crackers to\r\nbring together an authoritative chin and an arrogant nose. She found\r\nhim caustic and witty as he talked of everything and seemed to know\r\neverything. Then suddenly he would become vulgar, personal, conceited.\r\n\r\nHe played the Prelude to _Lohengrin_. “Never has anything been written\r\nto equal it,” exclaimed Von Bülow.\r\n\r\n“I alone,” said Wagner ..., “can do these things. No one else in the\r\nworld would dare to attempt them.”\r\n\r\nThen laughing, and, with a strong Germanic accent, he added: “People\r\ncan never tell whether I am hydrocephalous or a man of genius.”\r\n\r\n“Something of the first,” whispered Juliette to Mme. d’Agoult.\r\n\r\n“A great deal of the second,” rejoined the Countess, rather severely.\r\n\r\nWagner, who was extremely quick of hearing, had caught this whispered\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“He gave to each of us,” writes Juliette, “the ‛thank you’ we\r\ndeserved.” Then he talked well of Parisians and their mocking spirit.\r\nHe said how it grieved him not to be understood in France, and to have\r\nfor a rival any one so eminent as Berlioz.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible for you ever to understand one another,” said Mme.\r\nd’Agoult.\r\n\r\nDespite the personal antipathy with which Wagner inspired her,\r\nJuliette made enormous efforts to sell tickets for the three concerts\r\nhe was to give at Paris. And she disposed of so many that the musician\r\nactually sent de Ronchaud to her with a message of thanks from “the\r\nHydrocephalous.”\r\n\r\nThe first two concerts at least were a distinct success. At the second\r\neven Berlioz applauded.\r\n\r\nMme. d’Agoult, unlike most aristocratic Frenchwomen of her day, was\r\na brave pedestrian. That was what kept her such a good figure, said\r\nJuliette; and her young friend often accompanied her on her walks.\r\nIn May 1859, after having visited the Salon, they walked through the\r\nBois. Juliette seldom refers to her own _toilettes_. But on that\r\nday, she tells us, she was wearing a specially becoming costume, a\r\nfrock of black taffetas with no trimming, but wide sleeves of white\r\nlace, a fichu of black chantilly and a Leghorn hat with a cluster\r\nof cornflowers and strings of black velvet. It was a glorious May\r\nday. All Paris seemed to be out enjoying itself. As the Countess and\r\nJuliette walked past the Arc de Triomphe, Mme. d’Agoult said—\r\n\r\n“The war is imminent. Perhaps it will be declared to-morrow. God send\r\nwe may see France victorious and Italy delivered.”[69]\r\n\r\nFor months Mme. d’Agoult and her friends had been eagerly following\r\nItaly’s struggle for liberty. With the whole of France they ardently\r\ndesired their Latin sister’s liberation from the Austrian yoke.\r\nThe Countess herself had Italian connections. She was related to a\r\nwell-known Florentine family, the Peruzzi.\r\n\r\nJuliette, before she came to Paris, had known little of foreign\r\npolitics. Save for a vague prejudice against England, the legacy\r\nof the Napoleonic Wars, a mistrust of Prussia and a liking for the\r\nRussians because Russian soldiers, billeted in the house of Chauny,\r\nhad been kind to her grandmother, Juliette had no very decided\r\nsympathies or antipathies towards countries not her own. But in Mme.\r\nd’Agoult’s salon such indifference speedily vanished. On the very\r\nfirst evening in the Rue Presbourg she met the Alsatian, Nefftzer, who\r\nhad been editor of _La Presse_ and was later to direct _Le Temps_.\r\n“By him,” she writes, “for the first time in my life I heard foreign\r\npolitics lucidly discussed, and it was then that I began to take an\r\ninterest in them.”[70]\r\n\r\nAmong the European nations outside France, Italy was Juliette’s first\r\nlove and Garibaldi her greatest hero. Next to Italy, as one might\r\nexpect from so ardent a Hellenist, came Greece. She and her Grecian\r\nfriends were highly delighted when the Ionian Isles were reunited to\r\nGreece. She was in the South of France at the time, but de Ronchaud\r\nwrote announcing the good news and exclaiming “_Vive l’indépendence_.”\r\n\r\nBut that was in 1862. To return to 1859 and to the cause of Italian\r\nunity as it appealed to Mme. d’Agoult’s salon. Napoléon’s declaration\r\nof war against Austria so delighted Juliette and her friends that\r\nfor a moment they almost forgot their opposition to the Empire. The\r\nnews of the victories which followed increased their rejoicing,\r\nbut their joy was short-lived; for in a few weeks came a bitter\r\ndisillusionment. In July the Peace of Villafranca was signed. Instead\r\nof fulfilling Napoléon’s proud boast and freeing Italy from the Alps\r\nto the Adriatic, it delivered her tied hand and foot into the power of\r\nAustria. Francis Joseph remained master of Italy, the most powerful\r\nmember of the Italian Confederation, over which the Pope, Pio-Nono,\r\npresided.\r\n\r\n“Ah! we felt that Napoléon’s promises had been too good to be true,”\r\nexclaimed Juliette and her Republican friends. And, with more reason,\r\n“I told you so,” exclaimed M. Thiers. For the ex-Minister had advised\r\nthe Emperor not to engage in war against Austria. Italian unity, he\r\nforetold, would be followed by Prussian unity. And now he pointed\r\nout that France had not only made an enemy of Austria, but she had\r\noffended Italy, who saw that she had been duped. Italy was still\r\nfurther offended when Napoléon in direct violation of the Treaty of\r\nVillafranca insisted on annexing Savoy and Nice. Then, not content\r\nwith ranging against him Italy and Austria, the Emperor proceeded to\r\nalienate the Pope, whom he was pledged to support.\r\n\r\nOut of that mind which, as Lord Palmerston said, “was as full of\r\nschemes as a warren of rabbits,” Napoléon III produced at this\r\njuncture one of his numerous pamphlets. In this one he attacked\r\nnothing more nor less than the Pope’s temporal power, urging him to\r\nacquiesce in the independence of Romagna. This dangerous policy of\r\nplaying first with one party then with another made Juliette and her\r\nfriends tremble for France, despite their anti-clericalism.\r\n\r\nThey were kept closely in touch with Italian affairs by a friend of\r\nMme. d’Agoult’s, a man equally remarkable in the three fields of\r\nscience, literature, and politics, Alessandro Bixio, the founder\r\nwith Buloz of the _Revue des deux Mondes_. Born in 1808, Bixio was\r\na Genoese by birth, but had been educated in France. A moderate\r\nRepublican, during the terrible insurrection of July 1848, in an\r\nattempt to keep order in Paris streets, he had been severely wounded.\r\nHaving lost consciousness he was taken for dead, and left lying near\r\none of the barricades. Not having been heard of afterwards, his death\r\nwas announced, a memorial service was arranged, mourning was ordered,\r\nwhen suddenly his friend Hetzel, the publisher, received a letter\r\nfrom him. A concierge had found the wounded man lying in the street,\r\nhad taken him into the house, and there, after some days of coma, he\r\nhad returned to consciousness. He wrote to Hetzel entreating him to\r\nannounce his resurrection as delicately as possible.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the year, Bixio had been French Ambassador at Turin, later,\r\nduring Prince Louis Napoléon’s presidency, he was French Minister of\r\nAgriculture. After the _coup d’état_ he had retired into private life.\r\nBut he remained in close touch with Turin, which he visited every\r\nfortnight, never failing on his return to bring to the Rue Presbourg\r\nthe latest news from the Piedmontese capital. On one occasion, when\r\nMme. d’Agoult was going to Turin to see the performance of one of her\r\nplays, Bixio was her escort. The Countess’s story on her return of her\r\nreception by Victor Emmanuel and of her having seen Cavour, fanned\r\ninto yet greater ardour her guests’ passion for Italian unity.\r\n\r\nAlessandro’s brother, Nino Bixio, played a prominent part in\r\nGaribaldi’s Sicilian expedition, having commanded one of the two\r\nships which sailed from Genoa. This adventure he related in detail to\r\nJuliette some time later. Nino Bixio was one of the most fearless of\r\nmen; he was said to have plucked a bullet out of his own flesh, saying\r\nto his men, “See, such things are quite harmless.” When Juliette in\r\nconversation with his brother, referred to Nino’s intrepidity, “Yes,\r\nby my faith,” exclaimed Alessandro. “Did I not bring him up not to\r\nknow fear? Did I not, when he was a boy, hold him by one foot and let\r\nhim dangle from the balcony over the street?”\r\n\r\nJuliette eagerly and sympathetically followed Garibaldi’s adventures.\r\nShe collected all the details she could glean about her hero, and, in\r\n1859, published a pamphlet[71] which caused her to be regarded as an\r\nauthority on the Italian liberator.\r\n\r\nHer admiration for Garibaldi did not prevent her from appreciating\r\nthe services rendered to Italian liberty by the more judicious\r\nCavour. The tidings of Cavour’s illness, broken to Mme. d’Agoult in a\r\nletter from Turin, cast a gloom over the salon of the Rue Presbourg.\r\n“Cavour,” wrote the Countess’s correspondent, “is _in extremis_, the\r\nItalian doctors are killing him. They are butchers. They have bled him\r\nfourteen times.”[72] “Alas,” adds Juliette, “they bled him once more,\r\nand he died on the 6th of June” (1861).\r\n\r\nAlmost as fruitless as the Italian War was Napoléon III’s expedition\r\nto Syria on behalf of the Christians of Mt. Lebanon, threatened\r\nwith extermination by a neighbouring Mussulman tribe, the Druses.\r\nThis expedition, which was much discussed in Mme. d’Agoult’s salon,\r\nhad ended in the French, as the result largely of Lord Palmerston’s\r\nintervention, evacuating Syria and leaving the cause of the persecuted\r\nChristians to the Sultan’s somewhat uncertain championship. Renan,\r\nappointed to an archæological mission in Syria by the French\r\nGovernment, had chanced to sail with the expedition. As soon as\r\nhe came back, and returned to the Rue Presbourg, he was eagerly\r\nquestioned by Juliette and her friends as to his opinion of the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of it?” inquired Dupont-White, referring to the\r\nSultan’s protectorate and the French evacuation of Syria.\r\n\r\n“I think well of it,” replied Renan. “It will put an end to the\r\nmassacres.”\r\n\r\n“What,” exclaimed Dupont-White, “then do I understand that you were\r\nsent there to stir up religious fanaticism? I knew you received your\r\nmission through Prince Napoléon, so I thought your object would be\r\nrather to come to an understanding with the infidels. For I regard\r\nyour prince and you as being two of the finest specimens of infidelity\r\nin the world.”\r\n\r\n“But Prince Napoléon is a deist,” said Renan.\r\n\r\n“Very well. And you?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“I have no objection to saying _Mon Dieu_,” replied Renan. “But ...”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see Renan going to preach a crusade in Syria or anywhere\r\nelse,” said Littré, who had seemed to be dreaming.[73]\r\n\r\nTwo years later, on the 23rd of June, 1863, after Juliette had\r\nseparated from her first husband and was living with her parents at\r\nChauny, appeared Renan’s _Vie de Jésus_. From the point of view of\r\nits influence on free thought Dr. Lambert considered the publication\r\nof this book the most significant event of the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century. Juliette received twenty letters from her friends,\r\nsome extolling, others attacking the book. Mme. de Pierreclos thought\r\nit abominable and pernicious, all the more because of the perfection\r\nof its style. Ronchaud wrote admiring its poetry. “Even those,” he\r\nadded, “who disbelieve in the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth must\r\nhenceforth worship him.”\r\n\r\n“Renan,” said Dr. Lambert, “was like myself, a simple-minded, sincere\r\nand pious student of theology. But when he found the sacred text\r\ndistorted by those to whom it had been entrusted, he lost faith as I\r\ndid.”\r\n\r\nDr. Lambert on hearing that Renan had been deprived of his chair of\r\nHebrew at the Collège de France, exclaimed, “You see, imperialism,\r\nby treating Renan as an enemy, is pointing him out to us as our\r\nfriend.”[74]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] _Souvenirs_, II. 83. _Idées Anti-Proudhoniennes_ was signed\r\n“Juliette Lamessine.”\r\n\r\n[54] See Daniel Stern, _Mes Souvenirs_, 311.\r\n\r\n[55] Daniel Stern, _Histoire de la Révolution de 1848_, 2 vols.,\r\nParis, Charpentier, 1862.\r\n\r\n[56] Daniel Stern, _Mes Souvenirs_, 346.\r\n\r\n[57] _Ibid._, 349.\r\n\r\n[58] He had married Blandine, daughter of Mme. d’Agoult and Liszt.\r\n\r\n[59] Mme.

Adam, _Souvenirs_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuliette’s energy was crowding her life with a variety of interests\r\nand occupations: literary work, plays, parties, picture shows and two\r\ndistinct sets of acquaintances: Mme. d’Agoult’s rather aristocratic\r\nand elegant republican friends, and a much less fashionable circle.\r\nWhile Mme. d’Agoult and her associates concentrated on political\r\nreform, coming more and more into prominence in Parisian society was\r\nanother group of reformers, the collectivists, who were followers\r\nof Fourier and Saint-Simon. They, placing little faith in politics,\r\nwere working for a social revolution. With the latter’s schemes for\r\nhumanity’s regeneration, her father’s enthusiasm had already made\r\nJuliette familiar. But we, too, if we would enter into her life at\r\nthis time, must take note of these somewhat Bohemian reformers and of\r\ntheir Utopian aspirations, which, stimulating many of Juliette’s most\r\nintimate friends, could not fail to affect her own mind and character.\r\n\r\nAfter extreme individualism had permeated the thought of the first\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century, a tendency towards solidarity began to\r\ndeclare itself among certain bold thinkers. A feeling for association\r\nwas in the air. Association of whom and with whom was perhaps not\r\nquite clear. But, however defined, association, or, as we should\r\nto-day describe it, human solidarity, seemed in many enlightened\r\ncircles to offer the only possible remedy for the ills of society.\r\nEven such an ardent idealist as George Sand had been converted to this\r\ncomparatively new point of view. “Are there not misfortunes that\r\ncall more urgently for relief than the boredom of this or the whims\r\nof that individual?” she writes.[75] Louis Napoléon himself, before\r\nhe became Emperor, had shown in certain of those pamphlets, for which\r\nhe was famous, that he was not unaffected by this new current of\r\nopinion. The feeling of solidarity had declared itself definitely in\r\nthe early months of the 1848 Revolution. But its germs must be sought\r\nmuch earlier. We must go back fifty years to the time when the French\r\nRevolution was shaking society to its foundations. Then there appeared\r\na man, who, standing apart, aloof from the great scuffle of parties,\r\nentertained the daring thought of reconciling them all and making them\r\nall pull together in a new system. That man was François Marie Charles\r\nFourier. Born at Besançon in 1772, the son of a tradesman from whom he\r\ninherited a small fortune, Fourier became a commercial traveller in\r\nthe grocery line. Then he served for a while in Napoléon’s campaigns.\r\nBut, returning to his original occupation, he found employment in a\r\nwholesale house at Marseilles. There his employers instructed him\r\nsecretly to throw into the sea a whole cargo of rice which that\r\nfirm, in order to send up the price, had stored until it had become\r\nuseless.[76] This commission opened Fourier’s eyes to the iniquitous\r\nwaste proceeding in modern industry. Henceforth one of the most wildly\r\nimaginative minds that has ever existed outside a lunatic asylum was\r\nconcentrated on social problems. To the ideas that resulted Fourier\r\ngave expression in a whole library of voluminous works, of which the\r\nbest known is his _Théorie des Quatre Mouvements_. In this welter of\r\nelaborate theorising, wild schemes and absurd prophecies, such as\r\nthat the ocean may one day be replaced by a sea of lemonade, and that\r\nhumanity may once more develop a tail, it is possible to discover\r\ncertain sane and essentially practical suggestions for social reform.\r\n\r\nIt seems incredible that this commercial traveller, who on one side\r\nof his brain was so completely unreasonable, should have produced\r\na scheme which has in many respects now come to be regarded as\r\nfundamentally right. Fourierism, divested of its absurd extravagance,\r\ncontains the germ of much modern socialism. For Fourier was one\r\nof the first to realise “that social organisation should rest on\r\na comprehensive conception of human nature.” The first task of a\r\nreformer, he held, is to analyse human passions and to study their\r\ncombinations. But Fourier’s psychology, as one might expect, is\r\nextremely fanciful. He discovered twelve major passions which can\r\nbe combined into eight hundred and ten characteristic types. No one\r\nof these types can be fully himself, nor reap the greatest benefit\r\nfrom his labour in a state of isolation or in the state of permanent\r\nwarfare, which we call competition. In our present inorganic\r\ncondition, legitimate desires clash and may often be called vices.\r\nIn the free and communistic _régime_ of the future they will all\r\nbe harmonised. Production will be increased a thousandfold by the\r\nassociation of efforts. Labour will be no longer a curse, for it will\r\nbecome attractive through the free choice and constant change of\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nThe part of Fourier’s scheme which most appealed to his contemporaries\r\nwas his ideal community, in which he hoped to embody his ideas in\r\nconcrete form. This community he called the Phalanstery.\r\n\r\nJuliette well remembered how, when she was a child, a fervent\r\nFourierist had visited her father at Blérancourt. He had talked in\r\nsuch glowing terms of this ideal community that she forthwith resolved\r\nthat on her return to Chauny she and her schoolfellows would lose no\r\ntime in establishing a phalanstery. She was, however, reluctantly\r\ncompelled to admit the justice of her father’s remark that at the\r\nage of nine and a half she was rather young to launch out on so\r\ncomplicated an experiment. For, indeed, simplicity was no part of the\r\nroot idea of the phalanstery. This may be seen from the following\r\nenunciation of his principle by the master himself.\r\n\r\n“Since there are only eight hundred and ten characters,” argued\r\nFourier, “a phalanx of that number (or rather one thousand eight\r\nhundred with old men over one hundred and twenty and children under\r\nfour) will be sufficient to realise Harmony on about a square league\r\nof ground. This phalanx would live in a handsome and comfortable\r\nbuilding—farm, workshop and palace combined—called the Phalanstery. In\r\nthis association capital and talent as well as labour would have their\r\nproper reward.”\r\n\r\nFew of the various attempts to establish phalansteries met with any\r\nsuccess. Fourier himself, aided by one of his most eminent disciples,\r\nVictor Considérant, and financed by a French Député, endeavoured in\r\nvain to apply his theories at Condé sur Vesgres.[77] After Fourier’s\r\ndeath in 1837, another vain attempt at a phalanstery was made at\r\nCiteaux.\r\n\r\nBut it was on the virgin soil of America, in the light of the New\r\nWorld’s sanguine hopefulness and fervent enthusiasm for social\r\nprogress that the phalansterians were most confident of success. In\r\nAmerica Fourierism had aroused intense interest. There it had met with\r\nits most ardent advocates and its bitterest opponents.[78] Victor\r\nConsidérant, who after Fourier’s death became the chief apostle of\r\nFourierism, had founded a newspaper _La Démocratie Pacifique_ for the\r\nadvocacy of his doctrines. In the columns of this paper in the year\r\n1853, he sketched the outline of an ideal community, La Réunion, to be\r\nfounded in Texas on the banks of the Red River. Subscriptions to the\r\nexperiment flowed in from all parts of the world. The chief subscriber\r\nwas a rich American, Albert Brisbane. He had sat at Fourier’s feet\r\nin Paris. Fascinated by this new gospel, he was spending his life\r\ntranslating the reformer’s colossal and for the most part incoherent\r\nworks, vainly endeavouring to introduce into them something like order.\r\n\r\nBut, despite its brilliant prospects, La Réunion too was a failure.\r\nVictor Considérant, though a clever organiser, possessed neither\r\nlegislative nor administrative gifts. He was an apostle, nothing\r\nmore. And when adherents from all parts of the world flocked to the\r\nRed River, they found this anticipated ideal community, not, as they\r\nhad fondly hoped, the embodiment of perfect harmony, but a chaos of\r\nhopeless confusion.\r\n\r\nWarned by Brisbane’s experience and much to his disappointment, George\r\nRipley, Nathaniel Hawthorne and others, when they were organising the\r\ncomparatively successful socialist community of Brook Farm, at West\r\nRoxbury (Mass.), carefully kept off phalansterian lines.[79]\r\n\r\nThus by the time Juliette came to live in Paris the Phalansterian\r\nMovement had been tried and found wanting. Nevertheless it was\r\nnot dead. Its spirit still breathed in the numerous co-operative\r\nexperiments, which were being tried on every hand; and one of\r\nthese, the famous foundry at Guise, run on something approaching\r\nphalansterian lines, met with considerable success, owing to the\r\norganising genius of the founder, the Fourierist Godin. It endured\r\nuntil shortly before the Great War.\r\n\r\nFourier’s disciples, when in 1858 Juliette first came into personal\r\ncontact with them, had grouped themselves into what was called l’École\r\nSociétaire, which numbered some four thousand adherents. The school\r\nhad its headquarters in the Rue de Beaune, in a shop for the sale of\r\nFourierist literature, kept by a certain Mlle. Aimé Beuque.\r\n\r\nIt was to this shop that Juliette, soon after the publication of\r\n_Idées Anti-Proudhoniennes_, was taken by her good friend Dr. Bonnard.\r\nShe found Mlle. Beuque an odd creature. A quaint birth-marked,\r\nshrivelled-up little old maid, wearing a rough black serge gown, a big\r\nblack poke bonnet tied with broad strings, she had invariably hanging\r\nover her arm, a capacious bag, half satchel, half basket. Aimé Beuque\r\nhad known Fourier when he was a grocer at Lyons. Sitting at his feet\r\nshe had imbibed his doctrine and become one of its most convincing\r\nadvocates, winning for the new philosophy many a distinguished\r\nadherent. For in that poor little wizened unattractive body there\r\nburned a great soul passionately convinced that perfect harmony would\r\none day evolve out of all our apparently hopeless social chaos.\r\n\r\nThis little woman so charmed Juliette that she came away from the\r\nFourier shop feeling that in _la chère petite vieille Beuque_, she\r\nhad made a life-long friend. And for many a year whenever she\r\nwas downhearted, depressed by the domestic trials which were now\r\nthickening around her, Juliette’s due feet would not fail to cross the\r\nbridge to Mlle. Beuque’s shop, in search of that encouragement and\r\nconsolation which the “adorable” little spinster never failed to give\r\nher.\r\n\r\nOne of the most delightful features of Paris literary society has ever\r\nbeen the habit of writers and readers to foregather for leisurely\r\nafternoon talk in some well-known book-shop—at Anatole France’s\r\nfather’s, for example, on the Quai Voltaire; at his successor’s,\r\nHonoré Champion’s, on the Quai Malaquais, or at Charles Péguy’s at the\r\noffice of “Les Cahiers de la Quinzaine,” in the Rue de la Sorbonne.\r\n\r\nMlle. Beuque, too, had her afternoons; _le Jour des amis de notre\r\nvieille Beuque_ was an institution highly valued by Juliette and her\r\nFourierist friends.\r\n\r\nThe great and shining light, _le grand homme_ of _Tante Beuque’s_ shop\r\nparlour, was the eminent writer on natural history, Alphonse Toussenel.\r\n\r\nHis name had been a household word for Juliette in her childhood. Out\r\nof Toussenel’s book _L’Esprit des Bêtes_, Dr. Lambert had told his\r\nlittle girl many a thrilling tale about the habits of insects. And\r\nwhen, in their walks, they came to an ant-hill, father and daughter\r\nwould both lie down flat while the red republican parent showed the\r\nants at their work, designating the fighters, the layers of eggs and\r\nso forth, and declaiming loudly against the laziness of the queen ant\r\nas against that of all other royalties.\r\n\r\nNow that Juliette made the acquaintance of Toussenel in the flesh she\r\nfound him no less delightful than in his books. Though in certain\r\nrespects wildly extravagant and greatly given to paradox, in others\r\nhe appeared abundantly gifted with common sense. Some of his theories\r\nwere almost as curious as those of his master, Fourier. In his manner\r\nof life he was as eccentric as his devoted comrade, Mlle. Beuque.\r\nIn appearance, however, he presented a striking contrast to his\r\nmeagre little companion. For Toussenel was a fine figure of a man, an\r\nathlete, whose face was tanned by life in the open air, a sportsman in\r\nspite of his love for animals, and also a bitter anti-semite[80] in\r\nspite of his aspirations after social harmony. Toussenel’s attractive\r\npersonality and eloquent talk brought into the Rue de Beaune\r\nbook-shop an atmosphere of the most brilliant salon.\r\n\r\nToussenel was an enthusiastic feminist; so, of course, he had read and\r\nappreciated _Idées Anti-Prudhoniennes_; and for its charming author he\r\nspeedily developed a rapturous adoration. One of his eccentricities\r\nwas to illustrate human intelligence by that of animals. He likened\r\nJuliette to the falcon, because in that species of birds apparently\r\nthe intelligence of the female is superior to that of the male bird.\r\nTo his “falcon,” or _gerfaut_, he wrote ecstatic love-letters. Though\r\nshe laughed at her elderly _amoureux_, she kept his letters; and one\r\nof them, she quotes in her _Souvenirs_.[81] It closes pathetically\r\nwith this sentence—\r\n\r\n     “It is not your fault if you hold a larger place in my life than\r\n     I in yours. I do not write to complain, but to tell you that,\r\n     whenever any happiness comes to you, you may know that one of my\r\n     wishes has been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n                              “Yours in heart, mind and soul,\r\n\r\n                                                      “TOUSSENEL.”\r\n\r\nAs well as in the shop in the Rue de Beaune, Fourierists used to\r\ngather in the salon of Mme. Charles Reybaud. She was a novelist of\r\ndistinction, whom Juliette thought the only contemporary woman of\r\nletters worthy to be compared with George Sand.\r\n\r\nAt Mme. Reybaud’s Juliette met many prominent socialists, belonging\r\nto various groups. Some were Saint-Simonians, the followers of that\r\nextraordinary person Claude Henri, Comte de Saint-Simon (1760-1825).\r\nThis philosopher, realising, like Fourier, the disastrously chaotic\r\ncondition of society, had propounded various comprehensive schemes\r\nfor its reformation. Saint-Simon’s life had been one long series\r\nof romantic experiences, wild adventures and hair-breadth escapes.\r\nBorn of a noble family, priding himself on being descended from\r\nCharlemagne, at sixteen he was a volunteer under Washington. Returning\r\nto Europe, he grew rich on land speculations and stock jobbing under\r\nthe Revolution, but was imprisoned at the time of the Terror. In\r\nprison his ancestor Charlemagne, appearing in a vision, revealed to\r\nhis descendant that he was destined to be a second Messiah. On his\r\nrelease, to prepare for the accomplishment of this high mission,\r\nSaint-Simon entered on a course of scientific study and European\r\ntravel. He had married; but he divorced his wife in order to marry\r\nMme. de Stäel, who had recently become a widow. Journeying to Geneva,\r\nhe asked the author of _Corinne_ to unite her life to his, for he\r\npleaded: “You are, madame, the most extraordinary woman in the world.\r\nI am the most extraordinary man. Our offspring ought therefore to be\r\nstill more extraordinary.” To such an argument, however, unfortunately\r\nfor the human race, this otherwise public-spirited lady turned a deaf\r\near.\r\n\r\nHaving wasted his substance in wild schemes and extravagant living,\r\nSaint-Simon was reduced to poverty. At one time he attempted to blow\r\nout his brains, but only succeeded in disfiguring himself for life\r\nand in blinding one eye. He died in 1825, leaving behind him the\r\nreputation of a crack-brained Bohemian.\r\n\r\nSaint-Simon had been fortunate, however, in meeting with clever\r\ncollaborators, Augustin Thierry and Auguste Comte. These two eminent\r\nwriters helped him to formulate his somewhat incoherent notions, and\r\nto express them in a series of works[82] which exercised no little\r\ninfluence. Some of Saint-Simon’s ideas discussed in these works,\r\nnotably the piercing by a canal of the Isthmus of Panama, have already\r\nbeen carried out; others, like the institution of a parliament of\r\nnations for the regulation of international affairs, are still in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe dominant aim of all Saint-Simon’s schemes was the moral and\r\nphysical well-being of the least favoured and most numerous class\r\nof humanity. His doctrines had at once a practical and a mystical\r\ntendency. This dreamer, at a time when French industry was still in\r\nits infancy, “had a prophetic vision of modern production, with its\r\nscientific management and its unlimited capacity. He communicated his\r\nenthusiasm to his disciples, most of whom never saw him in the flesh.”\r\n\r\nFor it was not until after the apostle’s death that the Saint-Simonian\r\nschool of philosophy was formed. Its rapid success, its acceptance by\r\n“all the superior and even all the exceptional young men of the day,”\r\nwas largely due to the proselytising vigour and organising faculty of\r\nBarthélemy Prosper Enfantin, a man whom Lord Morley describes as “the\r\nmost wonderful and impressive figure of modern enthusiasm.”[83]\r\n\r\nFather Enfantin, as he was called, had only been introduced to\r\nSaint-Simon as he lay on his death-bed.\r\n\r\nBarely initiated (_à peine catéchisé_), writes Mme. Adam, this Elisha\r\nof Saint-Simonianism went forth to preach throughout the towns and\r\nvillages of France the golden age of the future. Signal success\r\nattended his crusade. There was much in the Saint-Simonian doctrine\r\nwhich accorded with the romantic humanitarianism of the age. “Its\r\nkey-note was love—love and pity for the oppressed, for the poor, for\r\nthe fallen woman, for the sinner, for Satan himself.” The service of\r\nmankind was the essence of this religion. For Saint-Simonianism was a\r\nreligion. As such, its founder and many of its disciples regarded it.\r\n_Le Nouveau Christianisme_ is the title of Saint-Simon’s last book,\r\npublished in the year of his death.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have said, this new philosophy had also its extremely\r\npractical side. Its adherents preached “the gospel of great public\r\nworks, railroads, maritime canals, free trade.” Here again they were\r\nresponding to one of the great needs of the age.\r\n\r\nA striking characteristic of society under the Empire was the\r\nintensity of its material activity. Industry on a large scale had\r\nbegun to develop under Louis Philippe. It had received a powerful\r\nimpetus from railroad construction.\r\n\r\nOne of the most wonderful experiences of Juliette’s childhood was her\r\nfirst railway journey. When she was ten and a half, her father took\r\nher by train from Amiens to Boulogne. This line, the first in France,\r\nhad recently been opened. Juliette was horribly frightened. Everything\r\nterrified her: the snorting of the engine, the diabolical air of the\r\nengine-driver and fireman, the piercing shriek of the whistle, and,\r\nabove all, the darkness of the tunnel, in which, she was told, a poor\r\nlady, who had put her head out of the window, had only that morning\r\nbeen guillotined by a passing train. When Juliette returned to Chauny,\r\nquite a heroine, because she had been in a train, this story told to\r\nher schoolfellows had a brilliant success. That unhappy passenger’s\r\ntragic fate remained for many a long day an object of intense\r\ninterest to the Mlles. André’s pupils, to whose inquisitiveness it\r\nsuggested all manner of questions.\r\n\r\n“Why did she lean out of window?” asked the elder girls. “People who\r\ngo on journeys ought to take care.”\r\n\r\n“Had she any children?” asked the juniors, “and, if so, were they\r\npresent?”\r\n\r\nAnd when Juliette replied that they were, the horror was indescribable.\r\n\r\nJuliette’s fame as a train traveller, however, soon faded, for so\r\nrapid was the spread of railway construction throughout France\r\nthat train journeys soon became every-day occurrences. Chauny was\r\nbefore long united by a railway line to Paris, which Haussman was\r\nrapidly rendering almost unrecognisable. And in all this mechanical\r\nactivity the Saint-Simonians were playing a prominent part. With them\r\noriginated many industrial enterprises: the Saint-Simonian Pereires\r\nfounded the _Magasin du Louvre_ and the General Transatlantic Company.\r\nFather Enfantin himself, a capable railroad administrator, was the\r\nfirst to conceive the project of the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam inclines to the opinion that as employers the\r\nSaint-Simonians were inferior to the Fourierists; for the latter\r\npractised division of profits among employers and employed, whereas\r\nthe Saint-Simonians showed a tendency to exploit their workers. They\r\nencouraged trusts. Their system Benjamin Constant described as _le\r\npapisme industriel_.\r\n\r\nBy the time that Juliette came to Paris the Saint-Simonians had split\r\nup into two sects. The scission had first declared itself during the\r\nRevolution of 1830, when Enfantin insisted on standing aloof from\r\npolitics, while his colleagues, Bazard and Rodrigues, declared that\r\nthe Master’s teaching rendered it incumbent upon them to take an\r\nactive part in political affairs. Further contention occurred over the\r\nrelations of the sexes. Enfantin declared himself the apostle of free\r\nlove, Bazard and Rodrigues upheld marriage; and it was on this point\r\nthat the Saint-Simonians finally separated into a school which was\r\nentirely political and philosophical—that of Bazard and Rodrigues—and\r\nthe so-called church of Enfantin, which represented the mystic and\r\nindividualist side of the Saint-Simonian doctrine.\r\n\r\nEnfantin and such followers as remained to him, only forty in number,\r\nleft the Rue Taitbout, which had been the Saint-Simonian headquarters,\r\nand went off to the suburb Menilmontant, where they established a\r\nsettlement. Singing songs especially composed for them, and attired in\r\ntam-o’shanters and light blue dalmaticas, the brethren, most of whom\r\nwere university students, cultivated the ground under the supervision\r\nof Father Enfantin, who wore a scarlet robe with a violet girdle and\r\na large metal necklace, each link of which represented one of his\r\ndisciples.\r\n\r\nFather Enfantin and his followers lived in the hope of the coming\r\nof a feminine Messiah, who, in conjunction with the Father, was to\r\nredeem the world. But their labours were interrupted and their hopes\r\ndashed to the ground by the intervention of justice. In the columns of\r\nthe Saint-Simonian newspaper, _Le Globe_, the Father had enunciated\r\nhis views of marriage and sexual morality, with the result that he\r\nfound his settlement at Menilmontant broken up, and himself (in 1832)\r\ncondemned to a year’s imprisonment. It was on his release that he went\r\nto Egypt and studied the feasibility of cutting a canal through the\r\nIsthmus of Suez.\r\n\r\nWhen Juliette published her _Idées Anti-Proudhoniennes_ Father\r\nEnfantin was back again in Paris acting as director of the Paris-Lyons\r\nMediterranée Railway. Struck by the cleverness of Juliette’s first\r\nbook, he sent two of his followers to invite the young authoress to\r\na Saint-Simonian banquet. But she thought it prudent to refuse the\r\ninvitation, having heard that the Father regarded her in the same\r\nlight as his Master had regarded Mme. de Staël, viz. as a possible\r\nfeminine Messiah, who with the Father should make all things new.\r\n“Enfantin,” remarks Juliette, “at the age of sixty-two, was somewhat\r\nlate in discovering his fellow-saviour,” though for her at twenty-two\r\nthe discovery was premature, for she did not feel herself ripe for so\r\nexalted a mission. “Just think what I was expected to bring to the\r\nworld!” she exclaims. “Nothing less than the golden age!”\r\n\r\nThough Juliette had refused the invitation to the banquet, she\r\npermitted her friend Arlès Dufour to take her to one of Enfantin’s\r\nevening receptions, where she found him assisted by a stout and comely\r\nlady. Arlès Dufour had been one of those who had brought her the\r\ninvitation to the Father’s banquet. From the first he had taken a\r\nfatherly interest in the young Mme. Lamessine; and she felt drawn to\r\nhim by a sentiment of filial devotion which never left her. He must\r\nindeed have been an attractive character. An ardent Saint-Simonian, a\r\npacifist, an advocate of women’s rights and an Anglophil, he was the\r\nfriend of John Stuart Mill and Richard Cobden. “It is charming to see\r\nhim, at sixty-five, with his heart still running off with his head,”\r\nwrites Cobden in 1860.[84] “He would not allow the word ‛obey’ to be\r\nused by women in the marriage ceremony, and has other very rebellious\r\nnotions.”\r\n\r\nThough in practice a staid citizen of Lyons, a devoted husband and\r\nfather of a family, theoretically Dufour, like his master, Enfantin,\r\nbelieved in free love. This was the only point on which he and his\r\nyoung friend Juliette disagreed. “Woman needs a certain dignity,”\r\nshe argued, “which can never be hers if she violates convention and\r\nneglects her duty to society.”\r\n\r\nArlès Dufour, a convinced free trader, was deeply interested in\r\nhis friend Cobden’s mission to Paris, for the purpose of arranging\r\na commercial treaty between France and England. During these\r\nnegotiations, Arlès, who was regarded as an authority on free trade,\r\nwas more than once consulted by the Emperor, and at a restaurant\r\ndinner in the autumn of 1860 he entertained Juliette, Mme. Reybaud,\r\nGirardin and some Saint-Simonian friends with the story of his\r\nimperial audiences. Unlike most of Juliette’s acquaintances, Dufour\r\nwas an Imperialist. But he had spoken rather freely to Napoléon on the\r\nsubject of his Saint-Simonian faith and his dreams for the future.\r\nThereupon the Emperor had remarked, “Don’t you think, M. Arlès, that\r\npeople may not be far wrong when they call you a crank?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” replied Arlès Dufour, “I am a crank, but your Majesty\r\nknows it is only the cranks who succeed.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor laughed loudly; then he rose and said: “Go, you bold man,\r\nand don’t return until to-morrow at two o’clock.”\r\n\r\nAt the same restaurant dinner the talk fell on the Suez Canal, which\r\nhad been begun two years earlier. The Saint-Simonians were aggrieved\r\nby Ferdinand de Lesseps’ appropriation of an idea which they regarded\r\nas the property of their sect. Girardin argued that de Lesseps had\r\nconceived the idea independently; that it was he who had communicated\r\nit to Saïd Pasha, who had received it with enthusiasm, and that de\r\nLesseps alone could carry the project through, particularly in the\r\nface of England’s opposition. Lord Palmerston, always suspicious of\r\nNapoléon’s designs, was, as Girardin remarked, conducting a veritable\r\ncampaign against the making of the canal.\r\n\r\n“Come, Arlès,” said Girardin. “You know how malicious Palmerston can\r\nbe when it is a question of any French enterprise. Your friend Cobden\r\nhas suffered enough from that. Palmerston’s campaign against the canal\r\nought to make you support de Lesseps instead of attacking him.... When\r\nde Lesseps comes to Paris I will take you to him, and you are too much\r\nof a Frenchman not to say, ‛Succeed, and you will have deserved well\r\nof the Saint-Simonian School in France.’”\r\n\r\nThus did this wily journalist of a Girardin win Arlès Dufour to\r\nhis side. But with the other Saint-Simonians present he was not so\r\nsuccessful; and one of them, who had a prophetic soul, was heard to\r\nmutter: “We shall see. But if the canal is a failure it will remain\r\nFrench; if it succeeds the English will buy it, as they buy everything\r\nthat is worth buying.”\r\n\r\nIt was in this year, 1860, that Mme. Lamessine published her second\r\nvolume, _Mon Village_,[85] a series of charming rural sketches,\r\nstories, dialogues, quaint old country ballads put into the mouth of\r\na village weaver. From the beginning to the end of this little book,\r\none breathes the atmosphere of the Picard countryside, when it was\r\nstill remote, before railways and motor-cars had brought it within\r\nreach of the capital. Juliette had written the book at the suggestion\r\nof George Sand, who, replying to a letter in which Juliette had said\r\nthat the days spent at her village of Blérancourt were the happiest of\r\nher life, enjoined her to write her memories while they were fresh.\r\n“Your title is found,” she added, “Mon Village.” The publishers\r\nwere, by a curious irony of fate, Hetzel and Lévy, the very two who\r\nhad most emphatically refused her first book. M. Lamessine, having\r\ntaken advantage of the power given him by the Code Napoléon, had\r\nappropriated the profits of her earlier publications. Juliette now, at\r\nHetzel’s suggestion, by dropping the last letter of her maiden name,\r\nmade use of the pseudonym “Juliette Lamber.” “It is a clever trick,”\r\nsaid her husband. “But I will make you pay for it.”\r\n\r\nJuliette’s domestic life was growing steadily more and more unhappy.\r\nArlès Dufour, her _bon père_, as she called him, advised her to\r\nseparate from her husband. But to such a course Dr. Lambert was\r\nstrongly opposed. However, the two fathers—the adopted and the natural\r\none—met at Chauny. There Arlès, “the white-haired old gentleman,” whom\r\nlittle Alice described as _un bon génie_, arranged everything, and for\r\na time Juliette gave up her life in Paris and returned to her parents’\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nMme. d’Agoult approved of the course her young friend had taken. And\r\nJuliette for some months devoted herself entirely to her literary\r\nwork. She was writing her third volume, a study of a Chinaman,\r\nwho visits Europe and somewhat in the manner of the travellers\r\nin Montesquieu’s _Persian Letters_ compares Eastern with Western\r\ncivilisation. Under the title of _Un Mandarin_ this book appeared in\r\nthe same series as _Mon Village_, before the end of the year 1860.\r\n\r\nJuliette at Chauny, now that the railway line had been opened, was\r\nnot altogether isolated from her beloved Paris. Her friends were able\r\nto come and visit her on Sundays. Hetzel on his way to Brussels made\r\na point of calling at Chauny; and Juliette herself sometimes went to\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion she went to Paris to visit her friend Eugène\r\nPelletan,[86] who was in Sainte Pélagie prison. The Imperial\r\nGovernment always kept a watchful eye on the press; and Pelletan had\r\nbeen sentenced to three months imprisonment for an article attacking\r\nthe Government, entitled _La Liberté comme en Autriche_, which had\r\nappeared in the _Courier du Dimanche_.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that Juliette had been in a prison. The visit\r\nleft an impression of horror on her mind, which obsessed her for\r\nmany weeks. Pelletan took her to see one of his fellow-prisoners,\r\nthat famous “monomaniac of conspiracy, Blanqui, who spent half his\r\npolitical life in the prisons of four different _régimes_.” Juliette\r\nrespected and pitied Blanqui as a martyr to Republicanism and the only\r\nkind of martyr with whom she could ever sympathise, the kind that\r\nreturns blow for blow. Passive resistance never appealed to Juliette’s\r\nrebellious spirit. Not even now, when she has become a Christian, does\r\nshe believe in the doctrine of turning the other cheek. In Blanqui she\r\nfound all the bitterness and disillusionment of the defeated rebel.\r\nWhen she offered him Daniel Stern’s _History of_ that _Revolution of\r\n1848_, in the first months of which he had played a prominent part, he\r\nseemed to regard it as an insult and refused even to touch the volume.\r\n\r\nJuliette returned to Chauny depressed and ill. She had contracted a\r\nsevere cold, which speedily developed into hæmorrhage of the lungs.\r\nShe concealed this alarming symptom from her parents, however, and\r\nmade an excuse to return to Paris, where she saw her doctor, not Dr.\r\nBonnard, but a throat specialist, a Dr. Cabarrus, whom she had lately\r\nbeen in the habit of consulting. He thought so seriously of her case\r\nthat he hurried her off to the South of France at once. From Paris\r\nto Cannes in those days was a long journey. The train took a day and\r\nnight to reach Toulon, which was the terminus. Then before Cannes was\r\nreached there were two days of driving.\r\n\r\nThe much-vaunted Riviera seemed to this young Picarde at first\r\nextremely dull. In her _Voyage autour du Grand Pin_, a book published\r\nin 1863, she writes: “I loathe travelling. I love the things I know,\r\nold books, old friends, familiar landscapes, familiar melodies,\r\nfamiliar enthusiasms.... I feel much worse at Cannes than I did at\r\nParis, and I can’t forgive the people who are for ever praising\r\nProvence.... What has happened to the sun? I have been asking. I am\r\ntold that it will soon come out. I wait. If you have heard any news\r\nof Phœbus do be kind enough to send me a telegram. I fear that some\r\naccident may have befallen him. Perhaps a seal may have devoured him\r\nover there at the back of the sea, where he is said to set in this\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nBut it was as she had been told, she had not long to wait, Phœbus\r\nApollo soon rose radiant from the sea; and with the glorious sun of\r\nProvence returned Juliette’s health and spirits.\r\n\r\nIntroductions from the north speedily surrounded her with interesting\r\nacquaintances: her physician, Dr. Maure, the friend of Thiers; Dr.\r\nMaure’s friends, Prosper Mérimée and Victor Cousin; Jean Reynaud,\r\nan eminent Saint-Simonian, but not of Enfantin’s group. At Jean\r\nReynaud’s villa, la Bocca, she met Lord Brougham. Mme. Reynaud, one of\r\nChopin’s most accomplished pupils, entranced Juliette by her rendering\r\nof Beethoven. Jean Reynaud took her long rambles. In one of these he\r\nrelated how he had come to leave Enfantin, having found his views on\r\nsexual morality quite impossible.\r\n\r\nNext winter, when Juliette returned to Cannes, her little Alice, now\r\nseven and a half, came with her and joined in these rambles at her\r\nmother’s side. Jean Reynaud was amused by Juliette’s respect for her\r\ndaughter’s personality. For Mme. Lamessine, mindful of the suffering\r\nendured in her own childhood through the proselytising ardour of her\r\ngrandmother and father, was careful not to impose on Alice any of her\r\nown ideas. With regard to fundamental things Juliette would say to the\r\nchild: “Grandfather thinks so and so, my view is such and such. You\r\nmust form your own opinion.”\r\n\r\nThe first time Jean Reynaud heard this kind of conversation he burst\r\nout laughing, and was about to repeat the phrase in jest, when\r\nJuliette stopped him with a look, and sending her little girl away to\r\npick some flowers, said: “Joke with me as much as you like, but not\r\nbefore her. Remember she has only me to respect.”\r\n\r\nSo charmed was the young author with her life at Cannes, so beneficial\r\nfor her own health and her daughter’s did she find the climate of\r\nProvence, that, before the end of her second winter there, she had\r\npersuaded her father to buy a building site on the Golfe Juan; and\r\nbefore her return to the north in the spring of 1862, the walls of her\r\nvilla of Bruyères were already rising.\r\n\r\nDr. and Mme. Lambert were thinking of selling their house at Chauny,\r\nin order to spend the summer months with their daughter in a Paris\r\nflat and their winters on the shore of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1862-3 found Juliette and Alice installed in their villa\r\nof Bruyères. Mme. de Pierreclos was their first visitor. Dr. Maure\r\ncalled frequently, always bringing with him his last letter from his\r\nfriend Thiers, which he was proud to read to his friends at Bruyères.\r\nBut, alas! he by whose advice Juliette had settled on the Golfe Juan,\r\nJean Reynaud, her “third father,” as she called him, was no more. He\r\nhad died in Paris, during the summer, after a surgical operation.\r\nHis loss left his adopted daughter disconsolate. Her book _Mon Voyage\r\nautour du Grand Pin_ she dedicated to his memory; for every one of\r\nits pages, she writes, had been inspired by their walks and talks at\r\nCannes.\r\n\r\nDr. Lambert, when he came to Bruyères, was as charmed as his daughter\r\nand granddaughter with the villa and its surroundings. He was\r\ndelighted with the garden which Juliette had planned. But, above all,\r\nhe was enraptured by the Mediterranean, which he saw for the first\r\ntime, and by the view of the island of Corsica in the distance.\r\n\r\nGazing upon this lovely prospect, the fervent classicist cried: “Ah!\r\nthis is Greece. And to think that I could ever have imagined that I\r\nunderstood Homer and all he described! Why, I must read him again,\r\nin the light of this new experience. And I will begin this very day.\r\nJuliette, have you our old Homer here? If not, I must go and buy a\r\ncopy at Cannes, at Nice, or even in Corsica, if need be.”\r\n\r\nHenceforth Dr. Lambert had no hesitation as to leaving Chauny. He\r\nwrote to his wife that the house must be sold. Juliette, as soon as\r\nthe winter months were past, returned to Paris to look for a flat.\r\n\r\nDr. Lambert, _le vieil étudiant_, as his daughter called him, would\r\nhave liked to settle in the Latin quarter, but Alice was bent on the\r\nRue de Rivoli, opposite the Tuileries Gardens, where she loved to\r\nplay. And it was Alice who had her way. Besides, as Juliette explained\r\nto her father, all Revolutions began in the Rue de Rivoli, and a flat\r\nin that street would be like a place in the stalls at the theatre.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] _Lettres à Marcie_, III. (1837).\r\n\r\n[76] _Biographie Générale_ under “F. M. C. Fourier.”\r\n\r\n[77] With regard to this phalanstery there is a slight discrepancy in\r\nMme. Adam’s _Souvenirs_. According to vol. i. p. 342, Condé was the\r\nphalanstery which her father, during her childhood, wished to join,\r\nwhereas according to vol. ii. p. 136, that phalanstery was Guise.\r\nProbably Guise is correct. For the Condé movement had been abandoned\r\nbefore Juliette was born.\r\n\r\n[78] Among the latter was Donald McLaren, author of a virulent\r\ndiatribe against Fourierism, published at Caledonia, Livingstone\r\nCounty, in 1844, entitled _The Boa Constrictor_, in which Fourier’s\r\ngospel is denounced “for the licentiousness of its principles, its\r\nhypocrisy and sinister aims.” In this connection it should be noticed\r\nthat, as a concession to the prejudices of the times, Fourier never\r\nattempted to give practical application to his theories as to the\r\nrelations between the sexes, to that “Phanerogamy” which is but\r\nanother name for promiscuity.\r\n\r\n[79] Founded in 1841, the Brook Farm Community broke up in 1847.

Adam’s gifts. It declared itself\r\nin her childhood. At school she was always the centre of a band,\r\ngrouping, organising her schoolfellows. When she came to live in\r\nParis, to create a salon became her dominating ambition. And it was\r\nno less a personage than that most distinguished and aristocratic of\r\n_salonnières_, Mme. d’Agoult, who first suggested to her young friend\r\nthe possibility of realising her aspiration.\r\n\r\n“Mine will remain the great salon of the winter,” said Mme. d’Agoult,\r\nwho frequently left Paris during the summer months, “and yours shall\r\nbe the little summer salon.” For Juliette, as we have seen, had begun\r\nto spend her winters in the south.\r\n\r\nThen the Countess proceeded to draw up a code of rules for Juliette’s\r\nguidance in the execution of her great social enterprise. “Mme.\r\nd’Agoult,” writes Juliette, “sent me _la très belle page suivante_.[87]\r\n\r\n“‘Happiness depends on renunciation and wisdom. If you would gather\r\naround you a number of men and a few intelligent women you must appear\r\nserene or happy.\r\n\r\n“‘Your life, though in reality it may be agitated, must appear to\r\nothers to be without complications and not lacking in unity.\r\n\r\n“‘Friendships can only be retained in an atmosphere which is\r\nimpersonal and restful.\r\n\r\n“‘In order that the founders of your salon may regard themselves as\r\nsuch you must consult them before you introduce any new-comers.\r\n\r\n“‘You should avoid exchanging confidences; for they create too close\r\nan intimacy; and they may lead you to give advice with which some day\r\nyou may be reproached.\r\n\r\n“‘Be modest, but not self-effacing. Be simple, but distinguished.\r\nExpress your opinions with a certain confidence. Appear firm, but also\r\ntolerant.\r\n\r\n“‘If you would preserve your salon your first duty should be to\r\nstimulate the intellectual curiosity of those whom you have gathered\r\nround you.\r\n\r\n“‘Be careful to make them feel that you are more occupied with them\r\nthan with yourself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“‘Twenty men friends and five women will suffice to found a salon. You\r\nhave them already.’”\r\n\r\nJuliette had not only the requisite number of friends, but now, in\r\nthe spring of 1864, she had also a home in the very heart of Paris,\r\nwhere she could receive them. And the dinner-party which, by way\r\nof house-warming, she gave in the flat in the Rue de Rivoli may be\r\nregarded as inaugurating her salon, that _salon minuscule_, as she\r\ncalled it, which was to be the summer ante-chamber to Mme. d’Agoult’s\r\n_grand salon d’Hiver_.\r\n\r\nSeven out of her twenty men friends were invited to dinner. They\r\nall accepted, and hence may be regarded as the pious founders of\r\nJuliette’s first salon. They were Edmond Adam, a wealthy financier,\r\nan ardent republican, one of the men of 1848, of whom we shall hear\r\nmuch later; Edmond Texier, a distinguished writer and a brilliant\r\nwit; the amorous Toussenel, of course; Peyrat, the most bigoted of\r\nanti-clericals; Nefftzer, now editor of the _Temps_; that polished\r\nJacobin, Challemel-Lacour; and the ever-faithful Ronchaud.\r\n\r\nFollowing Mme. d’Agoult’s instructions, and preserving, roughly, the\r\nfeminine proportion of one quarter which she had indicated, Juliette\r\nhad invited two women guests—Mme. d’Agoult herself and Mme. de\r\nPierreclos. But neither was able to come. The Countess, who seldom\r\nwent out anywhere, considered herself excused from accepting her\r\nyoung friend’s invitation by the recent death of her daughter, Mme.\r\nOllivier. Mme. de Pierreclos was away at Macon, staying with her\r\nuncle, Alphonse de Lamartine.\r\n\r\nThe conversation that evening gave the tone for the conversations in\r\nall Juliette’s salons: of the little salon in the Rue de Rivoli, of\r\nthe greater salon in the Boulevard Poissonnière, of the pre-war and\r\nthe post-war salon, of that extension of her salons which was _La\r\nNouvelle Revue_, and likewise of those latter-day assemblies which,\r\nsince her retirement from _La Nouvelle Revue_, seventeen years ago,\r\nMme. Adam has gathered round her on the terrace or in the spacious\r\ndrawing-room of her beautiful country home in the Abbey of Gif.\r\n\r\nWhether the late M. Émile Faguet ever visited either of these salons,\r\nI do not know. But if he did, he must have been ill at ease, for he\r\nwas one of those who found the political salon “uninhabitable.”[88]\r\nAnd at Mme. Adam’s, though literature, art, philosophy, and other\r\nsubjects were by no means excluded, politics held the first place.\r\nThroughout the Empire Juliette’s salon, first in the Rue de Rivoli,\r\nlater on the Boulevard Poissonnière, was a centre of energetic\r\nrepublican opposition to the Empire. The hostess’s chief desire was\r\nto reconcile the diverse currents of republican sentiment, to blend\r\nin the broad stream of freedom the various and too often conflicting\r\nstrands of progress.\r\n\r\nAlready on that initial evening we find three shades of republican\r\nopposition represented in the Rue de Rivoli salon. There was Peyrat,\r\nthe most rabid of reformers, who cared not what the Government might\r\nbe so long as it was a Republic. “_Qu’elle soit d’abord la République!\r\non verra après_,” he exclaimed.[89] There was the more moderate Edmond\r\nAdam, who feared what he called a pseudo-Republic; and there was the\r\nnationalist Nefftzer, the Alsatian, who steadily refused to avert\r\nhis gaze from the peril lowering across the north-eastern frontier.\r\nNefftzer, though calling himself a republican, would have supported\r\nthe Emperor had he shown himself capable of inaugurating a vigorous\r\nforeign policy. The editor of the _Temps_ was one of the few who in\r\nthose days perceived Bismarck’s true aims and character. “_Il est plus\r\nque dangereux, il est effrayant_,” exclaimed Nefftzer that evening.\r\nBut the editor’s lugubrious prognostications were jeered at by most\r\nof his fellow-guests. “Here comes to life again the illustrious\r\nJeremiah,” said Peyrat. Only Juliette and her _amoureux_ Toussenel\r\nexperienced any consternation at Nefftzer’s warnings. “I have long\r\nfelt,” said Toussenel, “that some one was undermining our race, our\r\ncharacter, our heroism.... You, Nefftzer, declare this some one to be\r\nPrussia. You have not wasted your time here this evening. You have\r\nwarned a patriot, and one who is not stoney-hearted. Thank you.”[90]\r\n\r\nIn Juliette’s salon at this time everything was an open question; for\r\nin these years, though she was swayed by strong preferences, she had\r\nno exclusions. Different shades of religious as well as of political\r\nopinion were represented. Anti-clericalism, though it dominated, did\r\nnot have everything its own way.\r\n\r\nWhen Juliette’s physician, Dr. Clavel, announced that the Masonic\r\nLodges were intending to drive Catholicism from France, Peyrat\r\napplauded, but Saint-Victor put in a plea for liberty.[91]\r\n\r\n“Whether one believes or disbelieves,” said Saint-Victor, “freedom is\r\nessential.”\r\n\r\nEugène Pelletan agreed with him; not so Peyrat, who uttered his usual\r\ncry: “The Republic before everything. And then....”\r\n\r\n“And then what?” inquired Duclerc,[92] who was one of the 1848\r\nrevolutionists.\r\n\r\n“After we have extirpated all error, then...”\r\n\r\n“But who shall decide what is error?”\r\n\r\n“We shall.”\r\n\r\n“Then you consider yourselves infallible?”\r\n\r\n“Is it or is it not a question of overthrowing the adversary?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but I should like to know in favour of whom and of what the\r\nadversary is to be overthrown.”\r\n\r\n“In favour of the principles of the Great Revolution.”\r\n\r\n“The principles of ’92 or ’93?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Peyrat; “not the Revolution as understood by Quinet, the\r\nRevolution emasculated of all that was most powerful in it. Michelet\r\n... has accepted the Revolution, including the Terror.”[93]\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Duclerc, “the French Revolution may not be\r\nconsidered apart from its ferocity?”\r\n\r\n“Ferocity which was necessary.”\r\n\r\n“And which may again become necessary.”\r\n\r\n“That may be.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“When Peyrat and Duclerc were discussing,” comments their hostess,\r\n“arguments flew so rapidly from side to side that we listened without\r\ninterrupting. Moreover, there was not the slightest chance of getting\r\nin a phrase or even a word edgeways.”\r\n\r\nThough politics held the first place in Juliette’s salon, as we have\r\nsaid, literature and art were by no means neglected.\r\n\r\nThe hostess herself, an ardent romanticist and idealist, if ever there\r\nwere one, had no sympathy with the realism which in the middle sixties\r\nwas beginning to invade French art and literature. Manet’s “Olympia,”\r\nwhen it was exhibited in the Salon, filled her with loathing. When she\r\nfirst saw it, she knew not whether to laugh or to cry.\r\n\r\n“_Quelle horreur et aussi quels rires_,” she exclaims. “_Voici\r\nl’Olympia de Manet. Nue, étendue, accoudée sur un drap blanc. Derrière\r\nelle une negresse tient un bouquet. Sur le drap blanc un chat noir\r\ndéteint et laisse la trace de ses pattes sales. Germinie Lacerteux en\r\nlittérature, le chat noir aux pattes sales en peinture, c’est complet!\r\nO idéal, idéal! Je vais revoir Picardia._”\r\n\r\nThe de Goncourts’ novel, _Germinie Lacerteux_, on its recent\r\nappearance, had been vehemently discussed in the Rue de Rivoli. “It\r\nis Lucrèce Borgia _graillonnante_,” exclaimed Lamartine’s niece, Mme.\r\nde Pierreclos. And most of her fellow-guests as well as her hostess\r\nwere up in arms at once when some one described the de Goncourts and\r\nFlaubert as the leaders of the realistic school. Flaubert, they\r\ncontended, would never have condescended to wallow in the mud which\r\nseemed as much the de Goncourts’ natural element as it was to be that\r\nof their disciple Zola. For the author of _La Terre_ and for all his\r\ntribe Juliette has ever manifested an extreme aversion.\r\n\r\nFrom the de Goncourts’ realism our passionate idealist turned\r\nwith relief to the classicism of her Grecian friends, Ronchaud,\r\nSaint-Victor, Ménard, and to those poets of the new Parnassian school\r\nwho shared her enthusiasm for the gods and ideals of antiquity.[94]\r\n\r\nJuliette’s _Salon Minuscule_, as she modestly called it, had now\r\nbecome a regular institution in Parisian intellectual society.\r\nPossibly it had been a greater success than its originator, Mme.\r\nd’Agoult, had ever anticipated. Possibly this may have accounted for\r\nthe clouds which now began to appear on the horizon of Juliette’s\r\nfriendship with that great lady, clouds which threatened to repeat\r\nin the nineteenth century that earlier story of the jealous Mme. du\r\nDeffand and her gifted young _protégée_, Mlle. de Lespinasse. Certain\r\nof Mme. d’Agoult’s friends were thought to be too often in the Rue de\r\nRivoli. Consequently, Juliette began to be coldly received in the Rue\r\nPresbourg. Mischief-makers were not lacking: they told the Countess\r\nthat in the Rue de Rivoli her works were somewhat severely criticised.\r\nWhile Juliette was at Bruyères in the winter of 1866-67 she received\r\na letter from Mme. de Pierreclos[95] warning her that somehow she was\r\nnot in the Countess’s good books.\r\n\r\n“_Attention, petite Juliette!_” wrote Lamartine’s niece. “_Vous n’êtes\r\npas en faveur. Je ne jurerais qu’à votre retour vous ne subissiez une\r\nbourrasque qui vous écarte à tout jamais de la Rue de Presbourg._”\r\n\r\nIn the crisis now approaching, one of the most momentous of Juliette’s\r\nlife, Mme. d’Agoult vouchsafed her young friend no sympathy whatever.\r\n\r\nFor some years, as we have seen, Juliette had been living apart from\r\nher husband. M. Lamessine had used to the full the powers, which\r\nuntil a few years ago the French law gave a husband, of appropriating\r\nhis wife’s earnings. Little Alice lived in terror that one day her\r\nfather might even claim that house and garden on the Golfe Juan, the\r\nbeloved Bruyères, where she and her mother spent happy winter months.\r\n“You must make haste and grow up,” Dr. Lambert used to say to his\r\ngranddaughter, “and then you will marry and Bruyères shall be your\r\ndowry.”\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of 1867 that Juliette received from her lawyer,\r\nM. Matthieu, a letter asking her to come and see him on a certain\r\nevening about a communication he had received from her husband.[96]\r\nM. Lamessine, in return for 15,000 francs, consented to relinquish\r\nhis claim to the royalties on his wife’s books published before their\r\nseparation. Distressed by the exorbitance of this demand, Juliette\r\nand Alice, who had accompanied her, on leaving the lawyer, tried\r\nto divert themselves by watching the crowds of merry-makers in the\r\nChamps Elysées. All Paris seemed _en fête_, for it was the summer\r\nof the Great Exhibition. But these gay sights afforded Juliette no\r\nsolace. Tired and sad, she and Alice returned home. On the table lay\r\na letter marked _urgent_. “Never mind,” said Juliette to herself,\r\n“I have enough worries for one evening. I will not open the letter\r\ntill morning.” It was late. Her father and mother had gone to bed.\r\nShe wished her daughter a sad good-night and followed her parents’\r\nexample. But she could not sleep, neither could she forget that letter\r\nmarked _urgent_. The writing seemed familiar. She rose and read it.\r\nThe letter was from her lawyer.\r\n\r\n     “DEAR MADAM,” it ran, “among the papers which I had set aside to\r\n     finish examining to-night is a letter from Algeria, which tells me\r\n     that your husband, M. Lamessine, died six weeks ago.... Thus the\r\n     question of your royalties is decided.[97]—Yours, etc....”\r\n\r\nJuliette has never been one of those who feign sentiments they do\r\nnot feel. About her first husband’s death she is in her _Souvenirs_\r\nperfectly frank: she makes no attempt to conceal the feeling of\r\nintense relief which the news brought to her. Dr. Lambert, when he\r\nheard it, exclaimed: “I know some one who will be glad to have me for\r\na father-in-law.”\r\n\r\nThat “some one” was Edmond Adam. One of the pious founders of\r\nJuliette’s salon, he had also been a member of Mme. d’Agoult’s\r\ncircle. Originally a journalist on the staff of the famous _National_,\r\nhe had made a considerable fortune and had become one of the mainstays\r\nof the Comptoir d’Escompte, a republican bank founded by his friend\r\nAlessandro Bixio and others. But that which had above all things\r\nattracted Juliette to the man who was to be her second husband—for\r\nhe was considerably Juliette’s senior—was his uncompromising\r\nrepublicanism, dating back to the Revolution of 1848, in which he had\r\nplayed a prominent part. Edmond Adam united to high principles and\r\nfervent idealism a distinguished appearance and ingratiating manners.\r\nAmong his friends he passed for a pleasant fellow. “A fine old\r\nSenator” he appeared some years later to a foreigner who visited Mine.\r\nAdam’s salon. “The chivalrous Adam,” she herself used to call him.\r\n\r\nShe noticed him first at a Wagner concert, standing opposite to her by\r\na mirror in which their eyes met. “Who is that tall gentleman?” she\r\ninquired of Mme. d’Agoult, who sat next to her.\r\n\r\n“Edmond Adam,” replied the Countess. “We are great friends. You\r\ndon’t see him at my receptions because of Girardin, whom he is\r\nalways wishing to fight. He will fight for anything or nothing.\r\nAfter Carrel’s death,[98] when Adam was editor of an Angers\r\nnewspaper, Armand Marrast invited him to join the staff of the\r\n_National_. His friends are Duclerc,[99] Grévy,[100] Carnot,[101] all\r\n_abstentionistes_, and so is Adam, though he is essentially a man of\r\naction.... On the 2nd of December[102] he was a Councillor of State.\r\nBut he refused to serve the Empire.... I don’t know any man who is\r\nmore highly esteemed, and I like him very much.... He is fidelity and\r\ndevotion itself.”\r\n\r\nDuring the insurrection of June 1848, Adam with his friend Bixio,[103]\r\nboth of them unarmed, had gone up on to the Paris barricades to\r\nendeavour to restore order. Afterwards, when the National Assembly\r\nwished to decorate the hero with the Cross of the Legion of Honour,\r\nAdam refused it on the ground that he could not wear a decoration\r\nwon in a civil war, and, moreover, that he had merely done his duty.\r\n“Ronchaud,” added the Countess, “has just told me that he [Adam] has\r\nread your book,[104] and that he would like me to introduce him to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nBut Juliette, moved by a sentiment not uncommon in women of deep\r\nfeelings, a kind of subconscious fear of a man who has profoundly\r\nimpressed them, refused that evening to make her new admirer’s\r\nacquaintance. Later, on the publication of her book _Mon Village_,\r\nhe wrote his congratulations. She replied somewhat curtly. But her\r\ncorrespondent was not discouraged. Some time afterwards, when she\r\nwas at the theatre with her friend, Mme. Fauvety,[105] whom he knew,\r\nhe joined their party. Mme. Fauvety admired him no less than Mme.\r\nd’Agoult. Dr. Lambert, too, had a high opinion of his daughter’s new\r\nacquaintance. “He is pure gold,” said Juliette’s father, “and when\r\nyou see him next you can tell him your father would like to shake\r\nhands with him; for he is one of those—and they are few—of whom an old\r\nrepublican may be proud.”[106]\r\n\r\nJuliette’s betrothal to Edmond Adam took place on the day after she\r\nreceived her lawyer’s letter. Congratulations poured in from all her\r\nfriends, with the one exception of Mme. d’Agoult. Yet she was aware\r\nof her young friend’s happiness. Ronchaud had told her. Since Mme. de\r\nPierreclos’ warning letter,[107] Juliette and her old friend had not\r\nmet. Now, with some misgiving, Juliette determined to go and see her.\r\nShe received her kindly. But in a few minutes the discordant note was\r\nstruck.[108] “The misfortune of being a widow,” said the Countess, “is\r\nthat one is seized by a foolish desire to remarry. But I don’t think\r\nyou capable of such folly. An intelligent woman should remain free and\r\nmistress of her own thoughts.”\r\n\r\n“I have greater need of happiness than of freedom,” replied Juliette.\r\n\r\nThen followed a distressing scene. Mme. d’Agoult completely lost her\r\ntemper. She told Juliette she hoped never to see her again. They\r\nparted; and the Countess’s wish was fulfilled. But when, some time\r\nlater, Juliette heard that her former friend had entered as a patient\r\nthe house of the famous nerve specialist, Dr. Blanche, she felt\r\nthat Mme. d’Agoult’s lack of self-control on that sorrowful day was\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the following year Juliette Lambert and Edmond Adam\r\nwere married. The intervening winter had been spent on the Golfe\r\nJuan, where Adam, like other friends of Juliette, the Texiers, for\r\nexample, had built himself a villa, Le Grand Pin. There had been a\r\nsomewhat heated discussion as to whether after marriage the Adams\r\nshould spend their winters at Le Grand Pin or at Bruyères. Juliette\r\ncould not tolerate the idea of leaving the house which she had built\r\nand the garden she had planned. Though, as she had told Mme. d’Agoult,\r\nshe longed more for happiness than for freedom, she was determined to\r\nhold her own in her new life. Already she had consented to abandon\r\nher flat in the Rue de Rivoli for one in a famous house, la Maison\r\nSallandrouze,[109] on the Boulevard Poissonnière, opposite Adam’s\r\nfavourite restaurant, the Café Brébant. She was making no small\r\nsacrifice by consenting to leave what seemed to her the hub of the\r\nuniverse, that Rue de Rivoli with its delightful proximity to the\r\nLouvre, to the Corps Legislatif, the doings of which this ardent young\r\npolitician followed feverishly, and to those Tuileries Gardens, where,\r\nwhile Alice was at play, her mother, in conversation with members of\r\nParliament on their way from the Assembly, could glean all the latest\r\npolitical news. Not unnaturally, therefore, Juliette’s keen sense of\r\njustice was outraged when Adam asked her to make the further sacrifice\r\nand give up her beloved Bruyères in favour of Le Grand Pin, although\r\nthis villa was much more spacious and imposing than her own dear home.\r\n\r\n“I entreat you,” pleaded Adam,[110] “do consent to live at Le Grand\r\nPin for at least two or three years after our marriage. I really\r\ncannot run the risk of being called M. Lamber in a district where you\r\nare so well known.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you need not fear; I can assure you I shall be called Mme. Adam.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think so,” persisted Adam.... “And however I may love\r\nyour name when borne by you, it would humiliate me.”\r\n\r\n“Very well then, I will keep it,” retorted Juliette.\r\n\r\nThey parted, and did not meet for several days. They were both\r\nmiserable. Then that kind physician, the good Dr. Maure, Thiers’\r\nfriend, effected a reconciliation.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you fools,” he cried, “at your age to lay down conditions and\r\nto be obstinate. When happiness runs to meet you, you turn away. Be\r\nreconciled at once.”\r\n\r\nAdam holds out his arms. Juliette hesitates. Dr. Maure makes a\r\ngrimace. “He will live at Bruyères. Embrace him. But it costs him\r\ndear. It is the greatest sacrifice he can make.”\r\n\r\nThe quarrel was at an end. Juliette threw herself into her lover’s\r\narms. He asked her pardon.\r\n\r\n“I ought to have understood, Juliette,” he said. “I was mad. I ought\r\nto have realised that your beloved Bruyères, which you had made with\r\nyour own hands, you could not leave for another house so close. It was\r\nwith money only that I created Le Grand Pin. To-morrow I will summon\r\nthe builders. I will enlarge Bruyères, and next year, when we return,\r\nwe shall be at home in your own house.”\r\n\r\nThe year 1868, the year of her second marriage, opened well for\r\nJuliette. “_Tellement riante_,” she writes, “_que j’y vois tout en\r\nbeau. Je suis heureuse autant qu’on peut imaginer...._”[111] As she\r\nawoke on New Year’s Day, Alice whispered, “Dear mother, I wish you\r\nwhat you already possess.”\r\n\r\nHer father, who had not come to Bruyères that year, wrote that he,\r\ntoo, was the happiest of men. For _cet étudiant rive gauche, ce\r\nfanatique de science_, as Juliette called him, was now at liberty to\r\nquit _cette rue impériale_, as he called the Rue de Rivoli, _infestée\r\npar les allées et venues de l’empereur et de l’impératrice_, and\r\nto inhabit the quarter of his dreams, to take a flat in the Rue S.\r\nJacques close to the lecture-rooms and laboratories of those eminent\r\nscientists, Paul Bert and Claude Bernard.\r\n\r\nIn every respect it was well that the two families should separate.\r\nThe discordant temperaments of Juliette and her mother rendered it\r\nimpossible for them to agree long together. Neither their summers in\r\nParis nor their winters on the Riviera had been very happy. And as for\r\nJuliette, the bliss of life with a husband who adored her and shared\r\nall her interests soon compensated her for the loss of her favourite\r\nstreet. “_Nous sommes heureux à rendre jaloux_,” she wrote soon after\r\nher marriage.[112] “But, on the contrary, our friends enjoy our\r\nhappiness. Their assiduity in visiting us grows. They love our home,\r\nand they cannot pass along the Boulevard Poissonnière without coming\r\nup to see us, especially in the evening.”\r\n\r\nThus the _minuscule_ salon of the Rue de Rivoli was transformed into\r\nthe Great Salon of the Boulevard Poissonnière.\r\n\r\nIn the two troubled years which were to elapse before the outbreak\r\nof war, the Adams’ salon was to serve, as we have said, as a\r\nmeeting-place for representatives of all parties in opposition: for\r\n_abstentionistes_ and for _sermentistes_, for the elder republicans\r\nwho followed M. Thiers, and for _les Jeunes_ who followed Gambetta.\r\n\r\n“_Bientôt_,” writes Juliette, “_notre salon réunit toutes les\r\nopinions, depuis les orléanistes jusqu’aux irréconciliables_.”[113]\r\n\r\nMme. Adam’s own attitude remained irreconcilably _abstentioniste_.\r\nShe had no sympathy whatever with those who, like her husband’s\r\nfriend, Jules Grévy, took the oath to the Empire in order to upset\r\nit. “_Prêter un serment qu’on est résolu à ne pas tenir_,” she\r\nwrites, “_c’est être déloyal et coupable_.”[114] Imagine her horror,\r\ntherefore, when she found her own husband wavering—first inclined to\r\nlisten to the arguments of his friend Thiers, and then, on the eve of\r\nthe 1869 election, announcing that he is going to his native Normandy,\r\nthere to stand as candidate for the village of Brionne.[115]\r\n\r\n“And _you_ will take the oath—you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I have thought it well over. Whatever objection you may have to\r\noffer has been considered and rejected.”\r\n\r\n“It seemed,” writes Juliette, “as if a gulf had opened between us.\r\nWhat I could not say to him when he started, I wrote to him.” With her\r\nletter she enclosed others from friends who had written expressing\r\ntheir astonishment at his decision. One was from Louis Blanc.\r\n\r\n“That the young who never witnessed the crime of December should swear\r\nallegiance to the murderer I can understand,” he wrote. “But how can\r\none who saw the blood flow, who heard the oath broken, forget, if his\r\nheart be kind and loyal?”\r\n\r\nOne morning, shortly after this packet had been dispatched, Mme. Adam\r\nreceived a telegram from Brionne containing one word: “Come.” She\r\nand Alice obeyed. They arrived at Brionne on the very day when Adam\r\nwas to take the oath. “I could not take it,” he said, “without being\r\nsure that you approve and that you realise its significance. Have you\r\nbecome any less narrow, any less bigoted, Juliette?”[116]\r\n\r\nBut no, Mme. Adam was as resolute as ever. And her husband, yielding\r\nto her arguments, or unwilling to create between himself and his\r\nwife an impassable breach, told his electors that he found himself\r\nincapable of taking the oath. “The candidate who replaced him,” adds\r\nJuliette, “did so well that the electors bore him no grudge. As for\r\nme, I am prouder than ever to bear his name.”\r\n\r\nLéon Gambetta was now, as the acknowledged leader of that wing of\r\nthe republican party known as _les Jeunes_, attracting considerable\r\nattention. He was a complete meridional, for his parents were a\r\nProvençal mother and a father of Genoese origin. He was born in 1837\r\nat Cahors, where his father kept a small grocer’s shop. Léon and one\r\nsister were their only children. It having been prophesied to Mme.\r\nGambetta, before her son’s birth, that he would one day be a great\r\nman, she denied herself in every way in order to give him the best\r\nof educations. He entered the legal profession and went to Paris.\r\nThere, among the students of the Latin quarter, he rapidly made his\r\nmark. No students’ manifestation was complete without him, neither\r\nwas any fête. He showed a marvellous capacity for repeating verses\r\nand drinking beer. He hated the Empire with exuberance, but not\r\nwith fanaticism. He was well read. Montaigne and Rabelais were his\r\nfavourite authors, and he was seldom seen without a tattered copy of\r\nthe latter protruding from his slovenly coat pocket. Passionately\r\ninterested in public affairs, he hardly missed a sitting of the Corps\r\nLegislatif. He was equally assiduous at the Café Voltaire and the Café\r\nProcope. There, no matter what subject was under discussion—books,\r\nplays, women, or politics—he never failed to monopolise the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nGambetta first appears in Mme. Adam’s _Souvenirs_ when Eugène Pelletan\r\ndescribes him to her as one of the riff-raff of the party (_les voyous\r\ndu parti_).[117] Later Girardin in Mme. d’Agoult’s salon had praised\r\nhis exuberance tempered by common sense.\r\n\r\n“_Vous n’imaginez pas la vitalité de ce gaillard-là_,” said\r\nGirardin.[118] “If only he were better put on, I would introduce him\r\nto you. But it is impossible. Nevertheless, he is a man of letters.”\r\n\r\nBut soon Juliette began to feel that without _ce gaillard-là, ce jeune\r\nmonstre, ce dompteur des foules_, as Gambetta was beginning to be\r\ncalled, her _Grand Salon_ was incomplete. Adam was meeting Gambetta\r\nconstantly at Laurent Pichat’s, and was ever quoting to his wife this\r\nrising young demagogue’s astute sayings.\r\n\r\n“We must introduce him into our circle; you must bring him to me,”\r\nsaid Juliette.[119]\r\n\r\n“But,” objected Adam, “he is very unfledged. Neither in manner nor\r\nin words does he know any restraint. His accent is impossible. He is\r\ninsolent in discussion. Moreover, I do not wish you to hear him talk\r\nof the men of 1848.”\r\n\r\nFor the idealists of 1848, for their lack of worldly wisdom, for their\r\nfailure to take advantage of the situation they had created, Gambetta\r\ndid not scruple to express his profound contempt.\r\n\r\n“But,” interjected Juliette, “is he really out of the common? Is he\r\nworth knowing? Yes or no?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is out of the common. He is worth knowing. But he is\r\nBohemian, vulgar, brutal. His manner of life is extraordinary. He is a\r\ntypical man of the masses, as Danton, _plus retors_. He has an air of\r\nauthority and dominates the conversation, no matter where he is.”\r\n\r\n“We will invite him,” said Juliette. Nevertheless, before making the\r\nfinal plunge, she took the precaution of consulting her old friend,\r\nHetzel, the publisher, who knew about Gambetta through a mutual\r\nfriend, Alphonse Daudet, another brilliant young Provençal, who was at\r\nthat time making his mark in Paris.\r\n\r\nHetzel pronounced the _jeune monstre_ to be quite impossible. “You\r\nshould hear Alphonse Daudet describe Gambetta’s southern clan, the\r\nclan of the _bas-midi_, composed of howling Gascons, of blatant\r\nwindbags of Provençals. He himself a kind of political commercial\r\ntraveller ... provincial to the marrow of his bones, a provincial\r\ngrocer withal, one-eyed and _chemisé et cravaté et pantalonné en\r\ndégringolade_.”\r\n\r\nSuch a picture gave Mme. Adam pause. But her husband pronounced it a\r\ncaricature. Alphonse Daudet had only seen Gambetta at restaurants. In\r\nLaurent Pichat’s salon he was better. Certainly he was too vehement,\r\nbut he was not a windbag. So he was invited to one of the Adams’\r\nfamous Friday dinner-parties to meet a number of distinguished\r\nguests, with most of whom he was previously acquainted: his friend\r\nLaurent Pichat, Eugène Pelletan, Jules Ferry,[120] Hetzel, who\r\ncame to form his own opinion of _le monstre_, those two faithful\r\nfriends Challemel-Lacour and de Ronchaud, d’Artigues, Duclerc, the\r\nOrleanist de Reims. _L’hôte exceptionnel_,[121] as Mme. Adam puts\r\nit, was another Orleanist, no less a personage than the grandson of\r\nGeneral La Fayette, the Marquis Jules de Lasteyrie. He had fought in\r\nPortugal for Don Pedro in 1832; he had sat on the left centre in the\r\nChambre des Députés under Louis Philippe; he had been exiled in 1852,\r\nbut had returned after the amnesty. Now, backed by Thiers, he was\r\nendeavouring, as candidate for Seine et Marne, to re-enter political\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAdam had told the Marquis that he was to meet Gambetta, and full of\r\ncuriosity, congratulating his hostess on her boldness, Lasteyrie\r\narrived early. “I shall tell Thiers about this party,” he said, “for\r\nhe is deeply interested in _le jeune monstre_.”\r\n\r\nGambetta, imagining that he was going to dine with a blue-stocking,\r\ndressed anyhow. He arrived wearing a nondescript kind of coat, with\r\na suggestion of a flannel shirt appearing between his high-buttoned\r\nwaistcoat and collar.[122] He looked thunderstruck when he saw every\r\none else in evening dress. Eugène Pelletan, who knew him well,\r\npresented him to his hostess. Adam was talking in another salon.\r\nGambetta begged Mme. Adam to excuse his not having dressed.\r\n\r\n“If I had known,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You would not have come,” she replied, laughing. “That is not nice of\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nM. de Lasteyrie, who was generally most tolerant, whispered in her\r\near.... “If he had come in a workman’s blouse, I might have passed him\r\n... but ... that!”\r\n\r\nJules Lasteyrie was to have taken Mme. Adam in to dinner.\r\n\r\n“The only way to rehabilitate him, my dear friend,” she said, “is to\r\ngive him the first place. I deprive you of it. But I am sure you will\r\nagree with me.”\r\n\r\nThe Marquis assumed his fine lordly air and replied: “You are right,\r\nthe servants might neglect him. Besides, we shall see whether he\r\nunderstands _le grand_.”\r\n\r\nThe hostess took Gambetta’s arm. He was overwhelmed at being placed on\r\nher right. Lasteyrie sat on her left. Adam could not believe his eyes.\r\n\r\nHardly had they sat down at table when Gambetta, leaning towards Mme.\r\nAdam whispered—\r\n\r\n“Madame, I shall never forget the lesson you have taught me.”\r\nEvidently he understood _le grand_.\r\n\r\nMany another lesson was Juliette to teach her illustrious friend. In\r\nmatters sartorial and social she was to find him an apt pupil. As Mme.\r\nd’Agoult had transformed the provincial young person into _une grande\r\ndame_, so Juliette was to turn the Provençal grocer, the political\r\ncommercial traveller, into a man of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen some ten years later she saw him at the opera faultlessly\r\nattired, with light gloves, a hat slightly tipped over one ear, a\r\ngardenia in his buttonhole, she felt proud of her handiwork.\r\n\r\nWhile Gambetta was ready enough to employ Adam’s tailor, he was not\r\nready to adopt all his or his wife’s political opinions. At that first\r\ndinner-party Mme. Adam and her guest, as Adam had foreseen, disagreed\r\non the question of the oath of allegiance to the Empire and on their\r\nestimate of the republicans of 1848.\r\n\r\nDespite these differences, however, for the next seven years, at\r\nleast, bonds of mutual admiration united Mme. Adam and Gambetta.\r\nDuring the national disasters now approaching her esteem for him\r\nsteadily increased;[123] she admired not his patriotism only, but his\r\nwisdom, his moderation; she came to regard him as the one hope of _la\r\npatrie_, the _cariatide_ of her beloved France.[124]\r\n\r\nIt was by his speech at the famous trial of Delescluze that Gambetta\r\nfirst established his fame as an orator. The days that proceeded that\r\ntrial, writes the historian Pierre de la Gorce,[125] in his vivid\r\naccount of these incidents, were _les derniers de sa vie obscure_.\r\nThat trial and the incidents leading up to it thrilled with excitement\r\nMme. Adam’s salon. They originated in a manifestation which had taken\r\nplace on the 2nd of November, 1868, round the grave of the republican\r\nleader Baudin. After Louis Napoléon’s _coup d’état_ of December 1851,\r\nBaudin, an ardent republican deputy, had endeavoured to incite the\r\nParisian populace to resist. They taunted him with caring chiefly to\r\nsecure the daily sum of twenty-five francs, which he received as a\r\nMember of Parliament. “Why should we be killed for your twenty-five\r\nfrancs?” they cried. “You will see how one can die for twenty-five\r\nfrancs,” cried Baudin, and he climbed on to the barricade, expecting\r\nthe crowd to follow him. But troops were coming up the street.\r\nBaudin was seen to wave a flag, and then to fall dead after having\r\ncalled to the people to come on. The republicans, who gathered\r\nround Baudin’s grave in the Montmartre Cemetery, did not lose this\r\nopportunity of expressing their opinions of the Imperial Government\r\nand of prophesying its speedy dissolution. They took themselves very\r\nseriously, and rather expected their little group of some sixty\r\npersons to be dispersed by the authorities. But what they thought to\r\nbe the roll of the guns of approaching troops turned out to be nothing\r\nmore than an announcement that it was time to close the cemetery.\r\nAfterwards, however, it occurred to certain Republican journalists,\r\nfirst to Delescluze of _Le Reveil_, later to Peyrat of _L’Avenir\r\nNational_ and to Challemel-Lacour of _La Revue Politique_ to open a\r\nsubscription for a monument to be erected to Baudin. The Imperial\r\nGovernment, ever with its eye on the press, determined to nip in the\r\nbud this project of honouring one of its arch enemies. Delescluze,\r\nPeyrat and Challemel, with certain of the manifestants, were summoned\r\nbefore the Sixth Chamber _Correctionelle_. It was Edmond Adam who\r\nhad urged Peyrat to bring _L’Avenir National_ into the movement. His\r\nfriend Thiers had rated him soundly for so doing. “_Cette affaire\r\nest insensée_,” said _le grand petit homme_,[126] always the soul\r\nof moderation. “_C’est de la faction! Ces choses-là conduisent aux\r\némeutes et aux révolutions._”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken,” replied Adam calmly. “We are placing an instrument\r\nin the hands of the opposition. You will soon recognise it. The\r\nEmpire’s enemies figure in the subscribers’ lists, and those lists\r\nwill one day furnish a basis for a coalition, which you will find\r\nuseful.”\r\n\r\nA few days later M. Thiers admitted that Adam was right. This eventful\r\nyear was now drawing to a close. The late autumn had come, and it was\r\ntime for the Adams to shut up their salon and go to Bruyères for the\r\nwinter. “But how,” writes Juliette, “could we discontinue our evenings\r\nin the midst of so much agitation, when our friends passing along the\r\nboulevard like to come up and talk in our salon?”\r\n\r\nThere was considerable discussion as to the advocate to defend\r\nDelescluze, who was regarded as the most important among the accused.\r\nFinally the choice fell on Gambetta.\r\n\r\nThe trial took place on the 13th of November. “_La surexcitation\r\nest extrême parmi nos amis. Les plus calmes s’emportent_,” wrote\r\nJuliette.[127]\r\n\r\nThe speeches for the defence were numerous and eloquent. But one alone\r\nhas survived. Needless to say it was Gambetta’s. With consummate skill\r\nhe converted his defence of his client into an attack upon the Empire.\r\nPosing that difficult question which has of late so often presented\r\nitself in French political life, Gambetta asked, “Can there ever be a\r\nmoment, when for the sake of the public weal it is right to violate\r\nthe law, to overthrow the constitution, to treat as criminal those who\r\ndefend the right at the risk of their lives? Louis Napoléon, when in\r\nDecember 1851 he effected his _coup d’état_, considered that such a\r\nmoment had arrived. But surely,” exclaimed this fearless republican,\r\n“this is not the time to justify such an act, for here we are in the\r\nprætorium of the judge, here the voice of the law alone should make\r\nitself heard.”\r\n\r\nThese words, as it may well be imagined, created an enormous effect\r\nin the court. There was absolute silence. The audience seemed to hold\r\nits breath. The parts were transposed: the defender had become the\r\naccuser. Several times the President endeavoured to interrupt. But\r\nsuch remonstrances as “Really, Maître Gambetta, you ought to reserve\r\nthat for your peroration,” as well as the objections of the opposing\r\ncounsel, passed unobserved amidst the thunder of that tremendous\r\nvoice. Gambetta merely redoubled his vehemence. He walked up and down,\r\nhe struck with his hand on the bar in front of him. His attitude no\r\nlonger was one of defence, but rather of rebellion. His disordered\r\nhair, his floating gown, his collar thrown open, his crumpled cap,\r\nwhich he was constantly putting on and taking off—everything betrayed\r\nthe intensity of an avenging wrath indifferent to everything save the\r\none matter which kindled it.\r\n\r\n“On the 2nd of December,” cried Gambetta, “they tried to deceive Paris\r\nwith the provinces, the provinces with Paris. Steam and telegraphy\r\nwere instruments in the hands of the new _régime_. Throughout the\r\ndepartments ran the announcement, Paris submits. Paris submits? Why,\r\nParis was assassinated, shot down, cannonaded.”\r\n\r\nThen like a defiance resounded the concluding ironical appeal to the\r\nEmpire—\r\n\r\n“Listen; for seventeen years you have been absolute masters, you have\r\nheld France in your power.... Yet you have never dared to place among\r\nthe national festivals that 2nd of December!... Well, we claim it,\r\nthat anniversary of the 2nd of December. We claim it for ourselves.\r\nWe shall never cease to celebrate it. Every year it will be the\r\nanniversary of our dead, until the day when the country, once more\r\nhaving become the master, shall exact from you the great expiation in\r\nthe name of liberty, equality and fraternity.”[128]\r\n\r\nAfter a long deliberation the court pronounced sentence, and all the\r\naccused were condemned. But few thought of them. Gambetta, though he\r\nhad failed to obtain his client’s acquittal, was the hero of the hour,\r\nfor he had brought a more serious indictment against a far greater\r\ncriminal. Fêted and congratulated on every hand, he was conducted to\r\nthe famous Restaurant Magny. No false modesty was his. He knew he had\r\ndealt faithfully with the tyrants, and he was not ashamed to own it.\r\n“_Comme je leur ai dit leur quatre vérités_,” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nIn Juliette’s salon that night there was wild enthusiasm. Adam and\r\nhis friends had heard the speech. They repeated passages of it. “You\r\nmust read it,” Adam said to his wife. “But it will not be the same as\r\nhaving heard it.”\r\n\r\n“The 13th of November,” writes Juliette, “was a fatal day for the\r\nEmpire.[129] ... The imperial tree had been sapped by the little\r\nCahors lawyer. It was not that Gambetta’s oratory was so very\r\nexceptional. His power lay in making his ardent soul vibrate to the\r\nemotion of the crowd.”\r\n\r\nThe Adams had found it well worth their while to postpone their\r\ndeparture for Bruyères in order to be in Paris at such a time.\r\n\r\nJuliette, on her arrival at her villa, was overwhelmed by the\r\ntransformation which Adam had worked in it. “_Mon Bruyères_,” she\r\nwrites, “_est embelli, transformé joliment à l’intérieur, sans avoir\r\nperdu quoi que ce soit de sa gracieuse et modeste physionomie_.”[130]\r\n\r\nNow that in her glorified Bruyères Juliette had three guest-chambers\r\ninstead of one, she could receive numerous friends from Paris. During\r\nthis winter Garnier-Pagès, one of her husband’s old friends, a man\r\nof “1848,” one of the founders of the Comptoir d’Escompte, came with\r\nhis family, and Juliette’s publisher Hetzel. On the Golfe Juan, as at\r\nParis, Mme. Adam gathered her friends round her; and Bruyères became\r\na veritable salon, with Prosper Mérimée for its _grand homme_. Of\r\nthis illustrious writer, in the evening of his days, Mme. Adam in her\r\n_Souvenirs_[131] paints a striking picture. She draws to the life\r\nhis elegant figure, always well put on. He affected grey trousers,\r\nwhite waistcoats, large soft blue cravats tied in an artistic bow.\r\nShe describes his eyeglasses, well posed on _un nez qu’on ne voyait\r\nqu’à lui tant la forme en était particulière_, his wrinkled, careworn\r\nforehead, his thick eyebrows, which gave him a cold, haughty and\r\nsomewhat severe air. There was something English about his appearance.\r\nHis mother was an Englishwoman, and he loved England. It was an\r\nadmirable country, he used to say, where reforms proposed by liberals\r\nare executed by conservatives. This statement, which like most\r\ngeneralisations is more striking than accurate, was natural to an\r\nobserver of British politics so soon after the Reform Bill of 1867.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VILLA BRUYÈRES, ON THE GOLFE JUAN, MADAME ADAM’S\r\nRIVIERA HOME]\r\n\r\nEach winter Mérimée and Juliette Adam became better friends. He paid\r\nher one of the compliments she appreciated most when he told Dr. Maure\r\nthat she had made him understand fraternity.[132]\r\n\r\nShe enjoyed his conversation immensely. “A talk with Mérimée,” she\r\nwrites, “is always full of surprises,[133] so wide is his knowledge\r\nand of a quality so superior.” His eclecticism delighted her. He\r\nbelonged to no school, but was ready to appreciate anything that\r\nappealed to him, modern or ancient, idealist or realist, romantic\r\nor classical. His _bête noir_ was exaggeration. He was artistic to\r\nthe finger-tips. He detested the photographic method of treating\r\nlife and nature. “Every artist at the beginning of his life,” he\r\nwould say, “must, I admit, be carried away by passion, by rapture,\r\nbut before long he must deny himself any ecstasy which might cloud\r\nhis imagination and dim his vision of reality; he must retain of his\r\npassion only so much as is necessary for its description.”\r\n\r\nMérimée, like Juliette’s friend Flaubert, was a heroic worker. He\r\nwould not hesitate to rewrite a page ten times. A term erased seemed\r\nto him but “a jumping-off place from which to reach _le mot juste_.”\r\nMme. Adam highly prized the lessons he gave her on style.\r\n\r\nIn general conversation he was not at his best. However interesting\r\nthe subject might be, he was ill at ease if the speaker did not appeal\r\nto him. He would assume a frigid manner. On the other hand, if the\r\nspeaker pleased him, he would hasten to pour forth all the treasures\r\nof his accumulated reflections.\r\n\r\nThe events of the summer of 1868, and the troubles of _L’Avenir\r\nNational_, an opposition newspaper founded in 1865, edited by Peyrat,\r\nand in which Adam had a large financial interest, had prevented\r\nJuliette and her husband from taking any honeymoon immediately after\r\ntheir marriage. Now, in the spring of 1869, accompanied by Alice, they\r\ntook their postponed wedding-tour to Italy. They visited Florence,\r\nthen the capital of the Italian kingdom, Milan, Turin and Genoa.\r\nFurnished with useful introductions by Thiers and other friends, they\r\nmet many interesting people, Cairoli, the Marquis Alfieri, Nino Bixio,\r\nthe Garibaldian soldier, whose brother Alessandro had been so intimate\r\na friend of Adam. At Florence they rejoiced to meet again the Italian\r\nexiles whom they had known in Paris. Mme. Adam, while admiring\r\nthe intense patriotism of the Italians, was grieved to perceive\r\nhow Napoléon’s papal policy had alienated them from France. At the\r\nmeetings of the Italian Chamber, the opposition’s violent attacks on\r\nFrance cut her to the heart.\r\n\r\n“_C’est pour Adam et moi une grande tristesse_,” she writes. “_Quoi!\r\ntout le sang versé, nos sacrifices, notre amitié, notre dévouement,\r\nnotre enthousiasme, à nous, républicains, qui nous à fait accepter\r\nun armistice dans notre lutte contre l’Empire, n’ont servi qu’à nous\r\nfaire une ennemi violente de l’Italie._”[134]\r\n\r\nJuliette was glad to see her last novel, _L’Education de Laure_,\r\ndisplayed in the book-shops of Milan. Driving home, along the Corniche\r\nRoad, in company with Nino Bixio, they had a memorable journey, to\r\nwhich we shall refer later.\r\n\r\nArriving in Paris in April, they found the capital in the throes of\r\npreparing for the general election, fixed for the 23rd and 24th of\r\nMay—the third election held since the establishment of the Empire,\r\nthe two previous had been in 1857 and 1863. But this, remarks Mme.\r\nAdam, was the first election which had been held since the granting\r\nof liberty of public meetings and of the Press, two reforms which had\r\nresulted from Ollivier’s establishment of what is known as l’Empire\r\nLibérale.\r\n\r\nJuliette in her salon on the Boulevard Poissonnière found herself\r\nquite as much in the movement as she would have been in the Rue\r\nde Rivoli. From her windows she saw, or imagined she saw, all\r\nmanner of wonderful happenings: strange meetings and consultations\r\nafter midnight between policemen and _les blouses blanches_, those\r\nsocialists, the mistrusted tail of the radical party, whom Gambetta,\r\nin his famous Belleville speech, was accused of humouring. His more\r\nmoderate friends thought he had promised too much: tariff and tax\r\nreform, election of all Government functionaries, suppression of\r\nstanding armies. “You must cut off this tail of yours,” remonstrated\r\nhis anti-socialist supporters. “Cut off my tail,” said Gambetta gaily,\r\n“not as long as I live. I will tie a white sash round it and lead it\r\ninto society.”[135]\r\n\r\nGambetta, at the head of _les Jeunes_ was opposing at Belleville\r\nHippolyte Carnot, that _vieille barbe_ as the heroes of 1848 were\r\ncalled. Baucel, another of _les Jeunes_ in another Paris constituency,\r\nwas successfully opposing Ollivier himself; and the founder of\r\nl’Empire Libérale was driven to a provincial constituency in the\r\nDepartment of Var. So unpopular was the minister in the capital\r\nthat his public meeting at Le Châtelet became a riot, during which\r\nthe famous beer-house Dréher was sacked before the police could\r\neffectually intervene.\r\n\r\nThe election cries of the opposition were “Away with personal\r\ngovernment,” “Away with a standing army and substitute a national\r\nmilitia.” With the latter neither Juliette nor her husband were in\r\nagreement. Jules Simon in their salon represented this party. And\r\nwhen Adam argued against him, upholding a standing army, maintaining\r\nthat without it a nation is lost, Nefftzer intervened saying, “You\r\nare right both of you. We must have a standing army and a national\r\nmilitia to defend the country against the German invasion which is\r\napproaching.”[136]\r\n\r\nThough many of her friends were standing as candidates, Madame Adam’s\r\nsalon continued to be well frequented all through the election. The\r\nguests, however, came later and went away earlier. Occasionally some\r\none would disappoint her. Jules Ferry, for instance, in one of the\r\nmost adroit of notes excused himself at the last moment.\r\n\r\n“_Madame_,” he wrote,[137] “_je n’appartiens plus ni à mes amis, ni\r\nà moi-même, ni aux choses gracieuses de la vie.... Or voici qu’une\r\nréunion d’électeurs apparaît à l’horizon, un peu plus farouche que\r\nvotre salon. L’électeur est un maître, vous le savez, et nous ne\r\nsommes pas sur un lit de roses; vous m’excuserez donc et vous me\r\npermettrez si ce mercredi soir m’est enlevé, de vous porter mes\r\nexcuses un matin._”\r\n\r\nAt the request of their friends the Adams, as will be seen, had\r\nchanged their day from Friday to Wednesday. Throughout the election\r\nJuliette had been full of hope. And the result did not disappoint\r\nher. For, although the Government maintained a majority in the House,\r\nthe opposition had won a striking moral victory. The forces of the\r\nopposition now led by Gambetta in the Chamber, had shown their\r\ngrowing power. Many of its candidates, Rochefort, for example, though\r\ndefeated, had obtained a large number of votes. The Empire was visibly\r\ntottering. Napoléon, ill and irresolute, was driven to grant the\r\nreformers concession after concession.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[87] _Souvenirs_, II. 462-3.\r\n\r\n[88] _Propos Littéraires_, 5ième série, 285.\r\n\r\n[89] _Souvenirs_, II. 450.\r\n\r\n[90] _Souvenirs_, II. 453.\r\n\r\n[91] _Ibid._, III. 29.\r\n\r\n[92] He had held office in the Provisional Government, had attempted\r\nto stem the tide of insurrection in the summer of 1848, and, having\r\nfailed, had retired into private life, occupying himself with the\r\nwriting of books and articles on political and economic subjects.\r\nAfter the war he returned to politics, and was Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs in 1883.\r\n\r\n[93] Quinet and Michelet had both recently published histories of\r\nthe Revolution.

Adam, _Souvenirs_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have been intimately associated with George Sand during the last\r\nfifteen years of that distinguished woman’s life, Mme. Adam regards as\r\none of her greatest privileges.\r\n\r\nEach of Mme. Adam’s seven volumes of _Souvenirs_ has its hero and\r\nheroine: her grandmother, Mme. Seron, dominates the first, Mme.\r\nd’Agoult the second, Gambetta the four last. George Sand, while\r\nintervening in several volumes, figures most prominently in the third,\r\n_Mes Sentiments et Nos Idées avant 1870_. Here we find a striking\r\nportrait of that celebrated novelist whom her English critic, W.\r\nH. Myers, considers “the most noteworthy woman, with perhaps one\r\nexception, who has appeared since Sappho.”[138] Mme. Adam knew George\r\nSand in the evening of her days, when she had lived down her enemies,\r\npartisanships, scandals, loves. They had passed away and left her “in\r\ngrand old age sitting beneath the roof that sheltered her earliest\r\nyears, and writing for her grandchildren stories in which her own\r\nchildhood lives anew.”\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Juliette Adam and George Sand should have\r\nbeen attracted to one another; for they had many natural affinities.\r\nThey were both passionately romantic and idealist. “_Je suis restée\r\ntroubadour_,” writes Mme. Sand in January 1867,[139] “_c’est à dire\r\ncroyant à l’amour, à l’art, à l’idéal_.” They were both incurable\r\noptimists, ardent adorers of nature, lovers of humble folk, and of\r\npeasants especially; delighting in simple things, in the joys of\r\nfriendship, in the pleasures of family life, though both had known\r\nmarital miseries. Their upbringing had not been unlike, penetrated in\r\neach case with a strong strain of paganism. Neither was a rationalist,\r\nfor surging up from the subconsciousness of them both was a keen sense\r\nof the unseen and a lively curiosity in the occult.\r\n\r\nTheir creeds differed: George Sand was a deist, Juliette in those days\r\na pantheist. But Mme. Sand was not mistaken when she prophesied that\r\none day her young friend’s faith would approximate more nearly to her\r\nown. “_Essayez donc de vous convertir à mon Dieu unique_,” she said.\r\n“_Il y’a en votre âme un grand vide de spiritualité dont vous ne vous\r\napercevez pas a cette heure, parce que vous avez la vie la plus pleine\r\nque se puisse imaginer, mais un beau jour vous sentirez l’insufficence\r\nque vous apporte votre croyance en l’incroyance._”[140]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1858, on the publication of her first book, _Idées\r\nAnti-Proudhoniennes_, written as we have seen partly in defence of\r\nGeorge Sand, that Juliette first came into personal relationship with\r\nthe writer whom she had long admired. “_George Sand me remercia par\r\nune fort belle lettre pleine de gratitude_,” she writes.[141] Later\r\nthe young authoress received a visit from one of Mme. Sand’s friends,\r\na certain Captain d’Arpentigny, who explained to her that, as she\r\nwas the friend of the Comtesse d’Agoult, with whom Mme. Sand had\r\nquarrelled,[142] the latter deemed it prudent that she and her young\r\nchampion should not meet. If some day Juliette should break off her\r\nrelations with Mme. d’Agoult, then she might come to see George Sand.\r\n\r\nSuch a condition was neither petty nor vindictive, though such at\r\nfirst it might seem. Considering the temperaments of these two\r\ndistinguished women—one endowed with the passionate vehemence and\r\nfrankness of the Celt, the other not lacking in a certain Teutonic\r\nvindictiveness—for Juliette to have been a loyal friend to them both\r\nat the same time would have been impossible.[143]\r\n\r\nThere was no reason, however, why Juliette and George Sand should\r\nnot correspond. Mme. Sand never failed to take an interest in her\r\ncorrespondent’s literary career.\r\n\r\nShe read all her books and gave the young author the invaluable\r\nbenefit of her criticism. Though her book _Mon Village_ was dedicated\r\nto Mme. d’Agoult, it was, as we have seen, written at the suggestion\r\nof George Sand.\r\n\r\nFor nine years Juliette and her unknown friend, her _amie éloignée_,\r\nas Mme. Sand called herself, continued to correspond. And it was not\r\nuntil Juliette’s final breach with Mme. d’Agoult, in 1867, that the\r\nformer considered herself at liberty to see in the flesh her whose\r\nspirit and whose writings she had admired so long.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam’s graphic description of the memorable meeting in the third\r\nvolume of her _Souvenirs_[144] has become almost a classic.\r\n\r\nWith her whole being throbbing with emotion, Juliette went by\r\nappointment to Mme. Sand’s flat, No. 97, Rue des Feuillantines. In a\r\nlarge arm-chair, which made her appear quite a little woman, Mme. Sand\r\nsat with both arms on a table in front of her, rolling a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“I approached,” writes Juliette; “she did not rise, but she pointed to\r\na seat, which I was to take, quite near the table. Her large kind eyes\r\nenveloped, attracted me. My pulse beat violently.\r\n\r\n“I made a great effort to greet her with a word. I found nothing to\r\nsay. My heart came into my mouth.\r\n\r\n“She lit her cigarette and began to smoke. She also seemed searching\r\nfor a word to address to me; but she no more than I could find\r\nanything to say.\r\n\r\n“Later I knew how reserved she felt in the presence of any one whom\r\nshe saw for the first time.\r\n\r\n“Then, realising that I must appear idiotic, my feelings overcame me,\r\nand I burst into tears.\r\n\r\n“George Sand threw away her cigarette and held out her arms to me. I\r\nthrew myself into them, possessed by that filial tenderness which I\r\nhad longed to experience, and which has remained with me to this hour.”\r\n\r\nNaturally they could not avoid talking of that disagreement with Mme.\r\nd’Agoult which had rendered the meeting possible.\r\n\r\nThen they discussed a theme constantly recurring in the conversation\r\nof serious persons in that day: the frivolity and corruption of\r\nParisian society under the Empire, and the reign of opportunism.\r\n\r\nThey rejoiced at the boldness of the manager of the Théâtre français,\r\nwho had dared to represent a play by Victor Hugo, then a political\r\nexile, and they delighted to think of the consolation it must bring to\r\nthe author in his banishment.\r\n\r\n“I left Mme. Sand,” writes Juliette, “after two hours of confidences,\r\nconfirmed in my adoration of her and in our friendship.\r\n\r\n“Would that I could tell and tell again all her delicacy of feeling,\r\nher nobility of heart, her moral elevation, her wide comprehension of\r\nlife, her serenity learnt in so hard a school, won at the price of\r\nsuch cruel experiences.”\r\n\r\nThat Juliette on her part had favourably impressed her new\r\nacquaintance may be seen by the terms in which Mme. Sand refers to\r\nher in her correspondence. Writing to Flaubert in September 1867, she\r\ncalls Juliette _une charmante jeune femme de lettres_,[145] and again\r\nto the same correspondent she exclaims later, _Mme. Juliette Lamber\r\nest vraiment charmante_. George Sand took a deep interest in all the\r\nmembers of her young friend’s family. At her invitation Juliette’s\r\nbetrothed, Edmond Adam, went to see her. They talked of 1848. Speaking\r\nof Juliette, Mme. Sand said to Adam, “I have waited long for _cette\r\nfille adoptive_”; of Adam to his bride, “He has a loyal hand:[146]\r\nyou must be proud to give him yours.”[147] Henceforth nothing would\r\nsatisfy Juliette and her affianced but that Mme. Sand should visit\r\nthem on the Golfe Juan. Juliette described her Bruyères as modest\r\nbut gay, Adam’s villa, Le Grand Pin, as fine and equipped with every\r\npossible comfort and convenience. George decided for Bruyères.\r\n\r\n“_Et me voilà_,” writes Juliette, “_aussi joyeuse qu’Edmond Adam va\r\ndevenir jaloux_.”[148] Mme. Sand, who adored children and was never\r\ntired of talking of her own little granddaughter Aurora, insisted on\r\nseeing Alice. With Juliette’s daughter it was a case of love at first\r\nsight. For Mme. Sand, who had a nickname for every one she loved,\r\nAlice was henceforth Topaz, because of the dark olive complexion she\r\nhad inherited from her Sicilian father, Lamessine.\r\n\r\nHenceforth Juliette lived in the hope of that promised winter visit\r\nto Bruyères. But before her southern flight in November, she was\r\nto see a great deal of her friend in Paris. In September they went\r\ntogether to Rouen and Jumièges.[149] They dined together in town. Once\r\nat Mme. Sand’s favourite restaurant, the famous Magny’s, on the left\r\nbank,[150] Juliette met for the first time an illustrious quartette\r\nof whom she was to see much later: Edmond and Jules de Goncourt,\r\nGustave Flaubert and Dumas _fils_. The friendship between Juliette and\r\nFlaubert, which dates from that evening, endured until the novelist’s\r\ndeath. With Flaubert’s family Mme. Adam has continued intimate, and\r\nthe opening weeks of this year (1917) she spent with Flaubert’s niece\r\nat her country house in the department of Var. The talk, _chez_ Magny,\r\nthat evening[151] was lively and frank, to say the least of it. The\r\nyouth, the beauty, the charm of Mme. Sand’s new friend, provoked Dumas\r\nto scoff at the idea of her becoming a writer and a _bas bleu_. He,\r\nlike Michel Lévy of old,[152] believed, as he put it, that she had\r\nsomething better to do. “_Il faut aimer, aimer, aimer_,” he cried. And\r\nFlaubert and the de Goncourts repeated, “_Il faut aimer_.” “To learn\r\nthat, gentlemen, I have not waited for your words of wisdom,” replied\r\nJuliette. “I love to love whom I love, and he, whom I love, loves to\r\nsee me write.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“The fool,” cried Dumas.\r\n\r\n“What an extraordinary idea,” exclaimed Mme. Sand, “to attempt to\r\nprove in my presence that a woman who is a writer cannot love.”\r\n\r\n“There is truth in it all the same,” said Edmond de Goncourt.\r\n\r\n“Never,” protested George Sand. “The reproach which may be brought\r\nagainst women writers is precisely that they have loved too much. _Et\r\nla preuve, dedans moi-même, je la treuve_,” she added, relapsing into\r\n_patois_.\r\n\r\n“You,” cried Dumas, “why you have never loved anything but the\r\nprefigurings of the heroes of your future novels, something like the\r\nmarionettes,[153] whom you have rigged out to repeat your play. Can\r\nthat be called loving?”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Flaubert. “Now, we four are writers of some standing. Can\r\nwe be called great lovers?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care,” replied Mme. Sand. “But, to confine\r\noneself to recent examples, it is absurd to maintain that Mme. de\r\nStaël, Mme. d’Agoult, Mme. de Girardin and I have not been passionate\r\nlovers. Indeed, on the contrary, what remains to be proved is the\r\npossibility of a pretty woman writer, who is really gifted, continuing\r\na simple, loving, faithful wife like any other woman.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is an interesting problem,” said Jules de Goncourt.\r\n\r\nThat evening Mme. Sand talked more than usual. Generally she preferred\r\nto listen, delighting to emphasise some witty remark, which she\r\nrelished more than any one by a frank outburst of laughter or a brief\r\nexclamation.\r\n\r\nIn conversation Mme. Sand was best in _tête-à-tête_. Some of the most\r\nmemorable of her confidential talks with her friend, Mme. Adam has\r\nreproduced in her _Souvenirs_.\r\n\r\nOne evening in Paris, when they were to have gone to the Odéon\r\ntogether, the play having been suddenly changed through an actor’s\r\nillness, “Let us stay at home and talk, dear Juliette,” said George.\r\n\r\nThat conversation marked the beginning of George Sand’s ascendancy\r\nover her young friend’s mind. “_A partir de cette heure_,” writes\r\nJuliette, “_ma grande amie maternelle a été mon guide”_.[154]\r\n\r\nAt the end of a long silence, during which she had been smoking\r\ncigarettes, throwing them into a bowl of water after a few whiffs,\r\nGeorge said, as if resuming the thoughts that had been occupying her—\r\n\r\n“I want my life to be useful to another, to the daughter whom I choose\r\nto adopt, to you, my child. As we learn to know one another better, as\r\nwe talk more and more to one another, I will tell you by what paths,\r\nalways roughest when I most sought to find them smooth, I have climbed\r\nthe hill of existence.”\r\n\r\nThrough all that she has written of George Sand, we find Juliette ever\r\nattempting to excuse, or at least to account for, the irregularities,\r\nthe ebullience, the wild passions of her friend’s exuberant and\r\nturbulent youth. She attributes them to the extravagance and\r\neffervescence of that romantic movement, in the hey-day of which Mme.\r\nSand lived the first half of her life. For this view of her friend’s\r\ncareer Juliette had the authority of George herself.\r\n\r\n“In my young days,” said Mme. Sand on this memorable evening, “I moved\r\nin a purely artificial world, in which we were all resolved to feel,\r\nto experience, to love, to think, differently from the vulgar herd.\r\nDetermined to avoid the bank, to swim out into the open, we were\r\nconstantly losing our foothold and floundering in unfathomable depths.\r\nRemote from the crowd, remote from the shore, always more and more\r\nremote. How many of us have not perished body and soul!\r\n\r\n“And those who would not be drowned, who struggled, who were thrown\r\nback on to the bank, they recovered their footing, they became like\r\nother people, through contact with the earth, and especially with the\r\ncommon sense of humble folk. How often have I not become myself again\r\nin the midst of peasants! How often has not Nohant cured me of and\r\nsaved me from Paris!”\r\n\r\nFor George Sand, as for Joan of Arc four centuries ago, as for\r\nAnatole France to-day, the most adorable, the most salutary, the most\r\nindispensable of all human sentiments is pity. Looking back from the\r\nvantage point of old age on the mad, passionate adventures of her\r\nyouth, Mme. Sand saw herself ever swayed from the bottom of her heart\r\nby _une grand pitié_. It was often that pity which caused her to\r\nquarrel with her lovers. She loved them as a mother loves her child.\r\nBut they demanded from her the love of a mistress.\r\n\r\n“_Quand je m’examine_,” she said to Juliette, “_je vois que les deux\r\nseules passions de ma vie ont été la maternité et l’amitié_.”[155]\r\n\r\nAfter numerous delays and postponements Mme. Sand, accompanied by\r\nher son Maurice and her friend Planet, at length, in February 1868,\r\narrived at Bruyères. The date of the visit had been so frequently\r\nchanged that Juliette and Alice had begun to fear that it might never\r\ntake place at all. “Cold outside, comfort within, and especially the\r\nhappiness of living surrounded by one’s family,” writes Mme. Sand to\r\na friend in Paris,[156] “have delayed my journey.” But on the 22nd\r\nof February she was able to write to a friend at Toulon from “Golfe\r\nJuan, Villa Bruyères.” “We are very comfortably installed, very much\r\nspoilt, very energetic, very happy. The day after to-morrow we are\r\ngoing to Nice, Monaco and Mentone. We shall be away three or four\r\ndays. Consequently you must try not to let your business bring you\r\nhere before the end of the week. Friday, for example, we are always at\r\nhome. For on that day Mme. Lamber receives. But if you come on another\r\nday you must let us know; for we generally spend the whole day out of\r\ndoors, and sometimes go a considerable distance.”[157]\r\n\r\nIn picnics, in visits to Monte Carlo and other scenes of gaiety,\r\nin sailing in _La Petite Fadette_, the yacht which had been Edmond\r\nAdam’s New Year’s gift to his affianced bride, the time passed very\r\npleasantly. George Sand was a fervent geologist and botanist. “Give\r\nme a piece of stone,” she would say, “and I will tell you the kind of\r\nflora it will produce.” By such means and without visiting the country\r\nshe is said to have given a background to some of her novels. On one\r\nof their picnics Mme. Sand suggested that they should found a new\r\nAbbey of Thelema, in which Juliette was to be housekeeper and caterer.\r\nAnd she could not have made a better choice, as will testify all who\r\nhave tasted of Mme. Adam’s hospitality.\r\n\r\nThe fortnight which Mme. Sand passed on the Golfe Juan was for\r\nJuliette one of the happiest in that happy year, 1868, the year of her\r\nmarriage with Edmond Adam. Bruyères was a home of delight to those\r\nwho enjoyed its charming hospitality and had the good fortune to stay\r\nthere. _La Villa du Bon Repos_ some of them christened it, and later\r\nit was known as “the Adam’s earthly Paradise.” During the February of\r\n1868 it was the gayest house on the Riviera.\r\n\r\nMme. Sand was a delightful person to entertain, so simple, so\r\ncontented, so entirely occupied with other people, never permitting\r\nher hosts to perceive in her the slightest suggestion of care,\r\nanxiety, or fatigue. Perfectly regular and orderly in her manner of\r\nlife, every day she made her first appearance at the twelve-o’clock\r\nlunch, and from that hour until ten her friends had her to themselves.\r\nAt ten in the evening she bade them good-night and retired to her\r\nroom to work, frequently until the small hours of the morning.\r\nJuliette, whose room was beneath Mme. Sand’s and who also went to bed\r\nlate, used to hear her moving about. Her cigarettes and a glass of\r\nwater were all she required for her long vigils.\r\n\r\nMaurice Sand, her son, himself a gifted writer, one of the wittiest\r\nand gayest of companions, the inventor and manager of the celebrated\r\nmarionette theatre at Nohant, entertained the company with his\r\njokes—no one could long be serious in his presence.\r\n\r\nMme. Sand’s friend Planet had been brought up to laugh at Nohant\r\n(_élevé à rire_), for Mme. Sand believed in mirth as the most\r\neffectual of sanitives. _La gaieté est la meilleure hygiène de\r\nl’esprit._ “Consequently,” writes Juliette, “I assure you we are not\r\nsad.”[158]\r\n\r\nGeorge Sand used to say that she was never sure of her friends until\r\nshe had stayed with them and lived some days of their life. Her visit\r\nto Bruyères drew more closely the cords of her intimacy with Juliette,\r\nand sealed their friendship.\r\n\r\nOn their return to Paris, and after their marriage, which took place\r\nin the spring, the Adams were constantly being urged by Mme. Sand to\r\nvisit her at Nohant. “_Chers enfants_,” wrote George, “_quand vous\r\nverra t’on? On vous attend maintenant tout l’été, sans aucun projet\r\nque le bonheur de vous embrasser tous trois_”[159] (Edmond Adam,\r\nJuliette and Alice). Adam had a horror of country visits. But in this\r\ncase he was willing to set aside his prejudice, and to accept the\r\ngreat George’s invitation. The Adams only waited until Juliette’s\r\nfather, Dr. Lambert, had recovered from an operation for stone.\r\nFinally, on the 4th of July, in time for their hostess’s sixty-fifth\r\nbirthday, _jour de bouquets et d’embrassades_, they arrived at Mme.\r\nSand’s picturesque home at Nohant, in the heart of that beloved Berry,\r\nwhich readers of her novels know so well.\r\n\r\nThe birthday of the mistress of Nohant was a fête for the\r\nneighbourhood. Maurice had spent the previous night decorating the\r\nhall and reception-rooms with garlands woven by the peasants. In\r\nthe art of decoration, the creator of the Marionette Theatre was a\r\npast master; and the whole house appeared a bower of flowers and\r\nverdure.[160]\r\n\r\nThe firing of a gun announced the luncheon hour. Marshalled by\r\nMaurice, the entire household, guests, servants and even the tiny\r\ngranddaughter Aurora, holding Alice’s hand, assembled in _grande\r\ntoilette_. Alice and her mother had been early out in the fields\r\ngathering wild flowers for the birthday nosegays, which they were\r\nto present to their hostess. Then she appeared. The servants cried:\r\n“_Vive la bonne dame._” Maurice read an address which he had prepared\r\nfor the occasion. “_Ce que tu es adorablement stupide_,” cried his\r\nmother, embracing him. Then all the guests in turn expressed their\r\ngood wishes. Luncheon passed gaily, the afternoon was spent out of\r\ndoors. But the great event of the day was the evening performance in\r\nthe marionette theatre.\r\n\r\nTo the description of this highly ingenious, perfectly artistic and\r\nmost entrancing of entertainments Mme. Adam devotes six pages of her\r\n_Souvenirs_. The spectators were encouraged to express their opinions\r\naudibly as the play went on. Each had his favourite actor or actress.\r\nMme. Adam, having declared her preference for a certain Coq-en-Bois,\r\nhe from the stage invited her to dine with him in a _cabinet\r\nparticulier_ at the Café Brébant. “Ah! no, I protest!” cried Adam; and\r\nled by the queen of the festival, the whole audience was convulsed\r\nwith laughter.\r\n\r\nIn theory, and in practice during her early days, always a rebel\r\nagainst order and discipline, in her home George Sand had ever been\r\nthe personification of orderliness. Perfect tidiness reigned in her\r\nsimply furnished study. In her desk and her large cupboards, every\r\ndrawer and shelf was furnished with a label indicating the contents.\r\nEqually precise was the arrangement of her bedroom, opening out of the\r\nstudy, with its fine old furniture and its hangings of blue—the colour\r\nof the Golfe Juan, as she said to Juliette. In her gardens, where she\r\nhad acclimatised an immense variety of plants, collected during her\r\ntravels, Mme. Sand took great delight. But no one was allowed to cut\r\nthe flowers. Those used for house decoration were all gathered in the\r\nwoods and fields.\r\n\r\nSerious conversation, profound discussions, Mme. Sand reserved for her\r\n_tête-à-têtes_. The general talk at Nohant was of the mirth-provoking\r\norder, that intelligent nonsense which clears the brain and\r\nsharpens the wits. If any one was inclined to be too serious, he was\r\nimmediately prodded into liveliness by one of those practical jokes in\r\nwhich the mistress of Nohant revelled. The unhappy Edmond Adam had all\r\nhis worst prejudices against country-house parties confirmed when he\r\nwas roused from his slumbers by the crowing of a cock, which Maurice\r\nhad hidden in the wood-chest of his bedroom. The wretched victim’s\r\nvociferations, mingling with the voice of chanticleer, as in night\r\nattire this much-tried guest searched for his tormentor, afforded\r\nintense amusement to the household assembled in the passage, as well\r\nas to Juliette, who, being in the secret, was cowering beneath the\r\nsheets, trying to suppress her laughter, and to Alice in the adjoining\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nSeveral days of the Nohant visit were occupied in excursions to places\r\nof interest in the neighbourhood, to the Druidical monuments of\r\nCrevant and to La Mare au Diable.\r\n\r\nAfter they had left Nohant the Adams continued to see a great deal of\r\nGeorge Sand. In the autumn of 1868 they accompanied her on a tour to\r\nthe Meuse Valley, which she intended to make the scene of her next\r\nnovel, _Malgré Tout_. The great George was a valiant traveller. None\r\nof the discomforts of country tours in days when inns were close\r\nand filthy disturbed her. With what she called the _poltronnerie_\r\nof Juliette and Alice, who complained of sleepless nights spent in\r\nhunting vermin, their friend had no sympathy. She only jeered at them\r\nfor not following her example and keeping the pests away by smoking\r\ncigars and cigarettes.\r\n\r\nMme. Sand returned with her friends to Paris. There she established\r\nherself in a flat in the Rue Gay-Lussac, from the windows of which she\r\ncould see her beloved Luxembourg. Her chambermaid, who had not the\r\nremotest idea of her mistress’s distinction, always addressed her as\r\n“Madame de Cendre,” and George forbade any one to enlighten her.\r\n\r\nMme. Sand had come to Paris to assist at the rehearsals at the\r\nPorte-Saint-Martin of her play _Cadio_. This indefatigable old lady of\r\nthreescore years and more, went every evening to the theatre, where\r\nshe stayed from six till two. In her company Juliette for the first\r\ntime penetrated “behind.” She was also present on the first night. But\r\nthe play was a failure. According to the author, this was chiefly\r\nbecause the principal actor, one Roger, persisted in wearing a hat\r\nwith a white feather instead of a battered and weather-stained cap.\r\nAs the curtain was about to rise Mme. Sand tore out the feather and\r\nbroke it. But swift as lightning Mme. Roger, an ex-milliner, sewed it\r\ntogether again. The actor entered beplumed. “_La pièce est perdu!_”\r\ncried the authoress.\r\n\r\nThe next year the Adams were staying at Pierrefonds. There George Sand\r\njoined them, and they spent together a delightful fortnight there.\r\nIn all that concerned her young friend, in Juliette’s spiritual,\r\nprofessional, domestic and physical welfare, Mme. Sand took the\r\ndeepest interest. She marvelled at the numerous activities Juliette\r\ncontinued to crowd into her life.\r\n\r\n“_J’admire q’étant ‛mondaine’ et toujours par monts et par vaux,”\r\nshe writes, “et très occupée de la famille et du ménage, vous ayez\r\nle temps d’écrire et de penser. Au reste, cette activité est bonne à\r\nl’esprit, mais n’usez pas trop le corps._”[161]\r\n\r\nSometimes George Sand feared for her friend the consequences of\r\nher excitable temperament and her untiring energy. She would have\r\nliked to have seen in her something of the serenity which the great\r\nGeorge had herself acquired. But she realised that with Juliette, as\r\nwith herself, this calm, this aloofness from life’s petty worries,\r\nwould come with old age. “We must not ask youth to anticipate age,”\r\nshe wrote. “And youth’s charm is in its impressionability.”[162]\r\nNevertheless, she adjures her friend to cultivate moderation in all\r\nthings, not to strive after violent sensations. “You are passionate\r\nand exalted,” she wrote to Juliette; “that is good and beautiful, and\r\nwe love you for it.” “But,” she adds, “do not, in your craving for\r\nemotion, afflict yourself unnecessarily. Spend yourself, but do not\r\nwaste yourself.... Your sleeplessness is not natural to youth.” It\r\nindicated, thought Mme. Sand, that something was wrong in Juliette’s\r\nordering of her life. She advised her not to work at night, but to go\r\nto bed at eleven, to rise at six and to write then, before the time\r\ncame for her daughter’s morning lessons. The writer of this letter\r\ndid not herself follow these precepts. But she had long passed out\r\nof Juliette’s condition of nervous excitability. “Work,” she added,\r\n“is an act of lucidity. Now, perfect lucidity is impossible without\r\npreliminary rest.”\r\n\r\nAlas! the course of international affairs was rapidly rendering\r\nimpossible that calm restfulness to which George Sand was so wisely\r\nexhorting Juliette.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1870 the Adams repeated their visit to Nohant. On\r\nthe 15th of July diplomatic relations between France and Prussia\r\nwere severed. On the 25th, M. Émile Ollivier read before the Corps\r\nLegislatif the French Government’s declaration of war.\r\n\r\nThe house-party at Nohant immediately broke up, and the Adams returned\r\nto Paris.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[138] W.

Il n’y a qu’à voir le désordre, l’impossibilité\r\ndes armements._”—George Sand to Mme. Adam, August 18, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor years a few clear-sighted Frenchmen had seen the German Peril\r\napproaching. Now it was at the gates of France. George Sand and Edmond\r\nAdam had been more afraid of the “Anglo-Saxon Contagion.” They had\r\nbeen inclined to scoff at Nefftzer’s jeremiads;[163] but now, alas!\r\nthey proved to be only too well founded.\r\n\r\nThe Adams in the anguish of their souls recalled their memorable\r\ndrive,[164] in the spring of 1869, along the Corniche Road, in\r\nthe company of Nino Bixio, the Garibaldian hero, who was then\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Italian army. Bixio had just returned from\r\nGermany, whither he had gone at Victor Emmanuel’s command in order to\r\nascertain the precise condition of the Prussian army. Bixio had come\r\nback firmly convinced that Bismarck was preparing war against France.\r\n\r\n“And you are not ready,” he had said to the Adams; “you will be\r\nthoroughly beaten.”[165]\r\n\r\nThen Adam, ghastly pale and half rising from his seat, had cried:\r\n“Silence, Nino, or I will throw you into the sea. France, beaten by\r\nthe Prussians! Never, do you hear? Never.”\r\n\r\n“And do you think it would give me pleasure?” the Italian had\r\nretorted. “But understand, if you don’t wish to be beaten ... then\r\nmake an end of your opposition’s foolish, wicked, criminal campaign\r\nagainst militarism. It is militarism which, entering into the very\r\nmarrow of Prussian bones, has for half a century been preparing her to\r\ntake her revenge for Jena. Ah! my poor Adam! How blind is France....\r\nYour Napoléon III is a provoker of invasion, and you republicans, you\r\nwill be ready to eat your hearts out for having been party men before\r\nFrenchmen. When you refuse him soldiers, you are idiotic.”\r\n\r\nThen Bixio had spoken of the negotiations for a triple alliance\r\nbetween France, Italy and Austria against Germany. According to the\r\nItalian General, it was Napoléon’s support of the papacy, in which he\r\nwas encouraged by his ultramontane Empress, that had rendered these\r\nnegotiations fruitless.\r\n\r\nIn order to pass on to their political friends Bixio’s warnings,\r\nthe Adams had hastened their return to Paris. But they might have\r\nspared themselves the trouble. For, with the exceptions of Thiers and\r\nNefftzer, no one had paid any heed whatever to the Italian General’s\r\nprognostications. French politicians were then absorbed in domestic\r\naffairs. But in a few weeks international matters forced themselves\r\nupon their attention. For a new cloud appeared on the horizon. This\r\nwas General Prim’s offer of the Spanish crown to a prince of the House\r\nof Hohenzollern. With feverish eagerness Juliette and her friends had\r\nfollowed these negotiations. Instead of the usual weekly dinner-party,\r\nfollowed by a reception, in Mme. Adam’s salon there had been an\r\nassembly every evening. Juliette and her husband were full of alarm.\r\nTheir German friend, Louis Bamberger, said: “This time, my children,\r\nyou will have to give in.”[166] One evening Adam, who had been to\r\nsee Thiers in the afternoon, related how the _petit grand homme_ had\r\nentreated him to supplicate his friends not to play with fire. “It is\r\npure folly,” he exclaimed, “we are on a volcano.”\r\n\r\nThen had come the news that Prince Anthony of Hohenzollern had on his\r\nson’s behalf renounced the candidature. “The incident is closed,” said\r\nthe chief minister, Émile Ollivier. “We were on the eve of war,” said\r\nThiers, “but now everything is arranged.”\r\n\r\nWith immense relief, believing peace to be assured, the Adams, who\r\nhad postponed their visit to George Sand on account of the national\r\ncrisis, now left Paris for Nohant.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! their equanimity had soon been disturbed. The French\r\nGovernment, not content with Prince Anthony’s undertaking, had\r\nrequired from the King of Prussia a promise that henceforth no\r\nHohenzollern should ascend the Spanish throne. King William’s refusal\r\nof this demand, and the events of the following fortnight, had\r\nculminated in the French Government’s declaration of war on July 20th.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of that day George Sand and her guests were sitting\r\nin the park at Nohant. Conversation languished, for the menace of war\r\nwas in the air. Suddenly the sound of a drum was heard. Every member\r\nof the company trembled.... Maurice came towards them, girded with\r\na drum, and crying, _Vive la France!_ George Sand and Juliette Adam\r\nburst into tears, while all echoed that cry _Vive la France_, which\r\nhenceforth was to be the motive power of all Mme. Adam’s being.[167]\r\n\r\nOn their return to Paris the Adams found awaiting them numerous\r\nletters from their friends, containing various opinions as to\r\nthe declaration of war. France in those days was not without her\r\nconscientious objectors. The pacifist Arlès Dufour would have\r\npreferred civil to international war. “The former would have cost\r\nless in men and in money,” he wrote. M. Adam’s German friend, Louis\r\nBamberger, took his leave of him, saying, “Love your country, Adam, as\r\nI love mine. I send you a last remembrance before the shock of arms.”\r\nBamberger, desiring with all his heart German unity, was the fervent\r\nadmirer of Bismarck, whom he regarded as alone able to achieve it.\r\n\r\nHetzel reported in Juliette’s salon how he had just seen Mérimée.\r\nIn the previous winter, at Bruyères, Juliette had found her friend\r\nobsessed by the impending calamity.[168] “You republicans,” he had\r\nsaid, “you have disarmed France; and we imperialists, asleep in our\r\nfalse security, have abandoned her.” “Now,” said Hetzel, “Mérimée is\r\ndeploring his country’s unpreparedness.” “We have soldiers, but we\r\nhave no generals,” he lamented.... “_Je supplie le grand Mécanicien,\r\nsi nous devons être vaincus, de faire cesser mes tours de roue._”[169]\r\nMérimée’s prayer was granted: dying on the 24th of September, 1870, he\r\ndid not live to see the consummation of his country’s defeat.[170]\r\n\r\nPaul de Saint-Victor, Juliette’s Catholic friend, was furious against\r\nRenan, whom he accused of being pro-German. It was true that Renan had\r\nadmired much that was German, and that he had often despaired of the\r\nfuture of France. He believed that the Germans would be the teachers\r\nof the world.[171]\r\n\r\n“Several of the University professors,” remarks Mme. Adam, “have not\r\nyet been able to bring themselves to love France as much as they have\r\nadmired Germany.”[172]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, despite these differences of opinion, a great wave\r\nof patriotism swept through the country. _“Il n’y a plus de petits\r\ncrevés,”_ writes Juliette, _“ils ont disparu comme par miracle et sont\r\ndevenus les soldats de notre France.”_[173]\r\n\r\n“People are beginning once more to use the word _patrie_.[174] It had\r\nbeen forgotten, buried beneath humanitarianism. Now it returns. It is\r\nuttered with reverence and devotion. Adam and I, when we pronounce it,\r\nfeel that to us both it is equally sacred.”\r\n\r\nMérimée had deplored the lack of generals in France. Bixio had said,\r\n“You have neither a Moltke, nor a Bismarck, nor a William.” When\r\nBazaine was appointed to command the Lorraine army, Mme. Adam went to\r\nsee her old friend Toussenel, who had known Bazaine at the time of the\r\nMexican expedition. “He is no soldier,” said Toussenel; “I am more of\r\none than he. He may be a politician. He is probably not lacking in\r\ndiplomacy, neither will he be above intrigue.”[175]\r\n\r\nThe hesitations and inactivity of the French army during the first\r\ndays of the war filled with misgiving the Adams and their friends. “We\r\nhad thought,” writes Juliette,[176] “that we could arrest the Prussian\r\nadvance by throwing ourselves before the enemy with all our _furia\r\nfrancese_ and our united forces. But already our troops are scattered.\r\nThere are marches and countermarches, but no advance. As during the\r\nItalian war, so now, there is no unity of command.” In those days\r\nParisians, like ourselves during the present war, were troubled by the\r\nlack of news. Silence, suspense, were harder to bear than anything.\r\n“A frightful silence fills the boulevard,” writes Edmond de Goncourt.\r\n“There is not a carriage to be heard, not a child’s cry of joy, and\r\non the horizon is a Paris where sound itself seems dead.” When it\r\ndid arrive the news was as bad as could be. All through August came\r\ntidings of defeat after defeat: Wissembourg on the 4th; Forbach and\r\nWoerth on one day, the 6th; then, on the 9th, the fall of Ollivier\r\nand the Ministry; finally, on the 1st of September, the rout of Sedan.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 3rd, when about six o’clock the terrible tidings\r\nbegan to spread like wild-fire through Paris, people came out into\r\nthe streets, crowds thronged the boulevards, growing every hour. By\r\nten o’clock, Paris between the Rue Montmartre and the Grand Opéra\r\npresented the appearance of one immense forum. Juliette went down and\r\nmingled with the people, listening to their conversation.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the humiliation and disgrace of France were described as\r\nunbearable. All manner of charges were brought against the Emperor.\r\nNapoléon was said to have surrendered, not himself alone, but the\r\nmunitions of the army. His own personal baggage, however, that long\r\ntrain of wagons encumbering the march of his soldiers, which had won\r\nfor him the nickname of _Empereur Colis_ (Luggage Emperor), he had\r\nsaved from the hands of the enemy.[177]\r\n\r\n“The Prussians will be at Laon to-morrow, and in three days before\r\nParis,” murmured one. “Wherever you look it is ruin. Our last army has\r\ncapitulated. We are a nation no longer. We are nothing but a troop of\r\nprisoners.”\r\n\r\n“Down with the Empire!” shouted hundreds of voices. All the hatred of\r\nthe crowd at first focussed on Buonaparte, then it turned against the\r\nCorps Legislatif, the Parliament, which had voted this accursed war,\r\nand by its baseness had consummated the national disaster. The Chamber\r\nhad been hastily convoked, and at midnight it was still sitting. “We\r\nmust march against it and turn it out,” howled the crowd. But on the\r\npoint of falling in for this purpose there was a hesitation. “What\r\nshould be the rallying cry?” Parisians more than any other people in\r\nthe world have ever been dominated by fine and appropriate words.\r\nAnd it was perfectly characteristic of the Paris mob that it found\r\nitself incapable of proceeding until it should have discovered _le mot\r\njuste_, the rallying cry, which should lead it like a banner.\r\n\r\n“Down with the Corps Legislatif?” was suggested.\r\n\r\n“No! No!”\r\n\r\n“Long live the Republic?”\r\n\r\n“No, it is too soon for that.”\r\n\r\n_“Vive la France?”_\r\n\r\n“No, that is too well known.”\r\n\r\n“Death to the Prussians?”\r\n\r\n“Better wait for that.”\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the crowd found the word, a word which indicated the\r\ntenor of the Revolution which was to follow: a word which like a ray\r\nof light was to conciliate a hundred opinions, to gather into one\r\ncollective act a hundred individual energies, a simple, powerful,\r\nirresistible, sonorous word, the voice of the people pronouncing the\r\npeople’s sentence upon that imperial _régime_, which, for close on\r\na score of years, had been preparing the ruin of France; the word\r\nwas _déchéance_ (dethronement). To the refrain of that word scanned\r\nthus—_Dé—ché—ance_, and sung to the refrain of _Les Lampions_, the\r\ncrowd thronged westward on to the Place de la Bastille, to awake\r\nthat revolutionary quarter, the Faubourg Saint Antoine, asleep for\r\ntwenty years. Then back again it surged on to the boulevards, there to\r\ndeliberate and to postpone the attack on the Corps Legislatif until\r\nthe morrow, Sunday.\r\n\r\nIn the small hours of that Sabbath morning Juliette from her window\r\nwatched the boulevards emptying, the people going home, but not to\r\nsleep. Lights in the windows announced a vigil—_la veillée des larmes_.\r\n\r\n_“Il semble”_, writes Mme. Adam, _“que sous chaque toit un malade est\r\nà toute extrêmité et qu’on passe la nuit à son chevet. Ce malade c’est\r\nLa France à l’agonie.”_[178]\r\n\r\nThe 4th of September dawned resplendent, an ideal autumn day. “The sun\r\nshines to-day,” writes Juliette in her diary.[179] “It is the people’s\r\nsun. There is no fear of rain damping our patriotism.”[180]\r\n\r\nIn this diary, which she kept for her daughter, who was away in\r\nNormandy, staying near Granville with her grandparents, Mme. Adam, as\r\nthey passed, described the events of those memorable hours. By ten\r\no’clock all Paris was in the streets, thronging towards the Place\r\nde la Concorde and the bridge leading to the Chambre des Députés,\r\nwhere the members of the Corps Legislatif were to meet at twelve\r\no’clock. Meanwhile, as the surging crowd outside grew larger and\r\nlarger and more and more clamant, in the smoking-room of the House\r\nof Representatives perplexed deputies were vainly seeking some new\r\nform of government to replace the Empire. They were hurriedly turning\r\nover pages describing those numerous constitutional experiments which\r\nFrance had been trying since the Great Revolution; between the Palais\r\nLegislatif and the Palais des Tuileries, where the Empress was on the\r\npoint of flight, all the time despairing ministers were hurrying to\r\nand fro. To Thiers’ house on the Place St. Georges the dying Mérimée\r\nwas dragging himself to entreat, on behalf of a woman and her son,\r\nthe intervention of _le petit grand homme_ on whose wisdom every one\r\ncounted.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam, from her place of vantage in a corner of the bridge close\r\nto the balustrade and the great lamps, listened to the talk which\r\nsurged around her. Some wanted a republic, others feared that a\r\nrepublic would mean a revolution. With the fire of republicanism\r\nburning in her own heart like a religion, Juliette felt moved to\r\nintervene in what she describes as her first public speech.\r\n\r\n“The Republic,” she exclaimed, “is not decreed, it is made, it is\r\nborn of yourselves. It represents the highest degree of courage, of\r\nintelligence, of activity, of expansion to which a nation can attain.\r\nIf society be a magnified edition of individuals, then the Republic is\r\nthe result of our noblest actions, a living assemblage of our broadest\r\nand most progressive duties, rights and interests. Henceforth no\r\nsocial malady, no monarchical canker shall kill it. Then long live the\r\nRepublic.”[181]\r\n\r\n“My pathos,” writes Mme. Adam, “was not without its success. But my\r\nchief delight was to hear repeated around me by thousands of voices:\r\n_Vive la République._”\r\n\r\nFrom twelve till three, while ministers were deliberating and Eugénie\r\nde Montijo was escaping from her Palace, the mob continued to surge\r\nround the Chambre des Députés.\r\n\r\nAt half-past three the deputies heard the crashing noise of doors\r\nbeing broken open: the crowd had invaded the Chamber. But, like\r\nCharles I, the Parisians found that the birds had flown; no ministers\r\nwere present, there were only a few deputies of the left. Among them\r\nwas Gambetta. He vainly tried to address the mob. But even that\r\nresonant voice could not obtain a hearing. Amidst cries of “Where are\r\nthe ministers?” he was howled down. And it was not until the ministers\r\nhad reappeared, and the President of the Chamber, M. Schneider, from\r\nhis official seat, had reminded the people of the danger threatening\r\nthem, with the enemy barely one hundred miles away, that there was\r\nsomething like order. The ministers, fearing the violence of the\r\nmob, stayed but a brief space in the Chamber. After their departure,\r\nGambetta entered the tribune and declared that Louis Napoléon\r\nBuonaparte and his dynasty had for ever ceased to reign in France.\r\n\r\nForthwith, at the invitation of another deputy of the left, Jules\r\nFavre, the crowd followed Favre himself and Gambetta to the Hôtel de\r\nVille. There at half-past four the Republic was proclaimed and the\r\nGovernment of National Defence declared. Its President was General\r\nTrochu, Governor of Paris and Minister of War. Of the fourteen\r\nmembers, all deputies either for Paris or the department of Seine,\r\nnine were the Adams’ personal friends. Gambetta was Minister of the\r\nInterior, Ernest Picard of Finance, Jules Simon of Education, Jules\r\nFavre of Foreign Affairs, Dorian of Public Works. Garnier-Pagès,\r\nPelletan, Emmanuel Arago and Rochefort were all ministers without\r\nportfolios.[182] When the Revolution broke out Rochefort was in prison\r\non a charge of high treason, based on his attacks on the Empire in his\r\npaper _La Lanterne_. On the afternoon of the 4th, he was liberated by\r\nthe crowd and brought in triumph to the Hôtel de Ville.\r\n\r\n“The end of that day was splendid,” writes Juliette.[183] “A fresh\r\nbreeze blew from the old river of Paris on to the assembled multitude.\r\nOnce again the Hôtel de Ville had become _le Louvre superbe des\r\nrévolutions_. The last rays of the setting sun gilded that people’s\r\npalace, played upon its windows, causing them to sparkle with a\r\nbrilliance far surpassing the glitter of all the diamonds in the\r\nimperial crown.”\r\n\r\nThe Revolution had passed without the shedding of a drop of blood,\r\nwithout a single deed of violent disorder. The forecast of a working\r\nman, whom Juliette had overheard that afternoon, had come true.\r\n“Ah, well!” he had exclaimed, looking round on the crowd,[184] “we\r\nare all here—we, the robbers, _les partageux_, the assassins! Here\r\nwe are on this fine Sunday. And there will be no robbery and no\r\nassassination.... Every one is pleased, even the omnibus company; for\r\nnot one of their ‛buses has been held up and they have not lost a\r\nthreepence.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was universal rejoicing. Confidence and determination\r\nshone on all faces. Old friends met in the street and embraced\r\none another. The fall of that oppressive _régime_ established on\r\nthe 2nd of December brought intense relief. On the day after the\r\nRevolution, George Sand wrote to Mme. Adam from Nohant a letter of\r\nfervent rejoicing: _“Quelle grande chose,”_ she exclaims, _“quelle\r\nbelle journée au milieu de tant de désastres! Je n’espérais pas cette\r\nvictoire de la liberté sans résistance.”_[185] Even with the enemy\r\nadvancing to their gates Parisians breathed again, realising that\r\nhenceforth it was for _la patrie_ and not for a dynasty that they\r\nwould fight.\r\n\r\nSearch as we will among the numerous records of those memorable hours,\r\npenned by those who lived through them, we shall find none describing\r\nmore vividly than these forty pages of Mme. Adam’s _Souvenirs_, the\r\ntalk, the incidents and the movements of that vast crowd, thronging\r\nthe Paris streets, all swayed by the excitement of a revolution. For\r\n_la grande Française_, as Mme. Adam was later to be called, never\r\nlives more intensely than when in a crowd. _“Je vis d’une autre\r\nexistence dès que je me mèle à la foule,”_ she writes.[186]\r\n\r\nThe gladness of that September evening, however, was but a rift in\r\nthe clouds now rapidly enveloping Paris. The Prussians were expected\r\nto reach the capital on Thursday, the 8th of September. They did not\r\narrive until the 19th. In the interval, Mme. Adam took a hasty night\r\njourney to Granville, in order that Alice might have a glimpse of her\r\nmother before she was shut up in the besieged city. After waiting five\r\nhours in a queue at the Gare Montparnasse, she obtained tickets for\r\nherself and her maid, and caught one of the few trains running. Adam\r\nfeared that she might not be able to return. But after spending a few\r\nhours with her family, whom she was not to see again for many months,\r\nshe tore herself away and entered the Paris train, which was said to\r\nbe the last. Indeed, whether it would continue as far as Paris seemed\r\ndoubtful. Juliette and her maid, who, with three fellow-travellers\r\nand a dog, were the only passengers bound for that destination,\r\nwere, however, promised by the driver that, if compelled to abandon\r\nhis train, he would take them on his engine into Paris. This was\r\nunnecessary, for, to the immense joy of Adam, who had almost ceased\r\nto hope for his wife’s return, the whole train steamed into the Gare\r\nMontparnasse.\r\n\r\nThis was on the 11th of September. During the following days Juliette\r\nwas busy stocking her larder ready for the siege.\r\n\r\n_“Je vais, je trotte, pour compléter mes provisions,”_ she writes.\r\n_“Il faut tant de choses! Tout peut manquer a un moment donné,\r\njusqu’au sel, jusqu’au poivre, jusqu’à la moutarde. Je déploie dans\r\nmes recherches tout mon génie domestique. Je ne rève que mouton\r\nd’Australie, Liebig, jambon, légumes Chollet, épicerie, comestibles.\r\nMes poches, ma robe, mes bas, mes mains, sont toujours encombrés\r\nquand je rentre. Si je découvre une conserve nouvelle, je rève à\r\nl’étonnement qu’elle causera dans trois mois, aux amis que j’inviterai\r\nà la manger! Verrai-je des héros surgir dans mon entourage: au lieu de\r\nleur tresser des, d’orner leur maison de guirlandes, je leur offrirai\r\nune bouteille de jeunes carottes confites, un sac de choux frisés: il\r\nfaut qu mon héros ait accompli les plus grands exploits pour que je\r\nlui présente un fromage tête de mort de Hollande.”_[187]\r\n\r\nAll Juliette’s friends were similarly employed. _“Le fanatisme de la\r\nprovision nous possède tous!”_ she exclaims, on meeting a Member of\r\nParliament loaded with boxes of sardines.\r\n\r\nHaving furnished her larder, Mme. Adam next volunteered to nurse the\r\nwounded, who were pouring into Paris. Her father’s lessons in anatomy,\r\nher grandfather’s lessons in the dressing of wounds, now stood her\r\nin good stead. She was appointed to install in the Conservatoire\r\nde Musique a private hospital with fifty beds. Henceforth the\r\nprovisioning and equipping of this hospital and the others which she\r\norganised later became her chief concern. “I hold out my hand to every\r\none; I beg, I write, I do everything to get money,” she says. It was a\r\ngrand day when the hospital workers, well provided with bags, bottles\r\nand baskets, were permitted to penetrate into the Tuileries, now given\r\nback to the nation, and to replenish their stores from the imperial\r\nlarder. Lists had been made out of the viands to which each hospital\r\nwas entitled: macaroni for the Conservatoire de Musique, sausages for\r\nthe Picpus Hospital, kidney beans for the Théâtre français, oil for\r\nthe Grand Orient, jam for all.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Conservatoire Hospital, Mme. Adam organised a\r\nworkroom where the wives, mothers and daughters of the men who were\r\nfighting, instead of staying at home and eating their hearts out with\r\nanxiety, could meet together, and, while sewing for the wounded,\r\nencourage one another and sympathise with one another’s sufferings.\r\n\r\nEdmond Adam was a member of the Government Committee appointed to\r\ninvestigate the condition of the general hospitals. This he found so\r\nlamentable, that in many instances, owing to the infection of wards\r\nand operating theatres, amputation cases had no chance of recovery.\r\n\r\nDespite the difficulties and dangers which beset her on every hand,\r\nMme. Adam’s heart burned with a courage and a hope, which her friend,\r\nGeorge Sand, appreciated to the full, when she wrote to her from\r\nNohant on the 15th of September.[188] _“Vous êtes généreusement\r\nexaltée par un peril prochain et défini.”_ This was one of the last\r\nletters Mme. Adam received before the gates of Paris were closed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163] See _ante_, 99.\r\n\r\n[164] _Ibid._, 118.\r\n\r\n[165] _Souvenirs_, III. 349 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[166] _Souvenirs_, III. 448.\r\n\r\n[167] _Souvenirs_, III. 464.\r\n\r\n[168] _Ibid._, 409.\r\n\r\n[169] _Ibid._, 470.\r\n\r\n[170] For Mme.

Adam, _Souvenirs_, December 7, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n“At present,” said Mme. Adam to a friend on the 27th of September,\r\n1870, “we have barely endured ten days of siege. And I will wager that\r\nin three months I shall not be any more disgusted with it than I am at\r\npresent.”[189]\r\n\r\nJuliette won her bet, for during the first three months of the siege\r\nshe bore her sufferings cheerfully and without flinching. And even\r\nduring the fourth month, though her health broke down, her courage did\r\nnot fail.\r\n\r\nDuring those interminable four months the two million souls cooped up\r\nin Paris knew every misery which has ever fallen to the lot of the\r\nbesieged: internal discontent and disorder, resulting in the abortive\r\nrevolution of the 31st of October; extreme scarcity of food and\r\nmunitions of war for nearly three weeks, the 20th of December until\r\nthe 8th of January; complete isolation from the rest of France and\r\nfrom the whole outer world.[190] To these sufferings, which Juliette\r\nshared with her fellow-citizens, was added her personal anxiety for\r\nher daughter’s safety. She did not even know where her daughter\r\nwas. She hoped that Alice, with her grandparents, had succeeded in\r\ncrossing to Jersey; for the Prussians were said to have invaded\r\nNormandy. But for many a long week, from the 19th of September until\r\nthe 20th of December, no news came. Juliette endured this agony of\r\nsuspense with fortitude. Then at length, through Mme. de Pierreclos,\r\ncame tidings that Alice was well and with her grandparents at St.\r\nHelier. Straightway Juliette’s motherly mind flies at once to\r\nother anxious parents in the besieged city who are still without\r\nnews of their children. For all through those days of horror Mme.\r\nAdam’s heart never ceased to beat in unison with the hearts of her\r\nfellow-sufferers, to bleed with their sorrows, to throb with their\r\nanxieties and their fears. Living thus in constant communion with\r\nher neighbours, she was able to depict graphically in her journal\r\nthe perpetual ebb and flow of public feeling and opinion: now it was\r\nconfident and hopeful, now foreboding and doubtful, but never, not\r\neven in the ghastly days of the end, completely conquered by despair.\r\nThroughout, with the exception of the actual days of bombardment, the\r\ncomic spirit, Juliette’s inseparable friend, never forsook her; and,\r\nwhile feeling to the tragic point the sufferings of others, she was\r\nable to joke about her own sorrows and privations.\r\n\r\nNext to her separation from Alice, the hardest to bear of her personal\r\ntrials during the siege was being compelled to leave her flat in the\r\nBoulevard Poissonnière. On the 11th of October, Adam having been\r\nappointed Prefect of Police, he and his wife had to take up their\r\nabode in the Préfecture.\r\n\r\nIn the halls and corridors of that gloomy building, what hours of\r\nweary waiting for a passport’s stamping have not many of us endured\r\nduring this war-time! We can well sympathise, therefore, with Mme.\r\nAdam’s horror at the idea of spending not hours only, but days,\r\nweeks and months within the Préfecture’s lugubrious portals. We can\r\nunderstand her grief at being obliged to exchange her cheerful flat,\r\nher “dovecot” on the Boulevard Poissonnière, for _l’affreuse prison_\r\nin the Rue de Jérusalem.\r\n\r\nTo any one with her vivid imagination it was a perfect nightmare\r\nmerely to watch the going and coming of the prison-vans, lumbering\r\ninto the courtyard of La Sainte Chapelle, and to hear the cries of\r\n“No. 1 for Mazas, No. 2 for Ste. Pélagie.”[191]\r\n\r\nIt was during her residence in the Préfecture that occurred that\r\ninsurrection of the 31st of October which proved a premonition of the\r\nCommune. The popular discontent with the Government, and especially\r\nwith its President, General Trochu, who was also Governor of Paris,\r\nhad been growing for some weeks. It was brought to a head by the news\r\nthat Le Bourget, one of the forts outside the capital, which had been\r\ncaptured from the Prussians on the 28th of October, had been retaken\r\non the 29th. On the 30th, Mme. Adam, on her way to her hospital from\r\na concert in the Cirque Pas de Loup, found the boulevard in an almost\r\nrevolutionary ferment. The people were exclaiming: “We do not demand\r\nsuccesses, but we will not have defeats resulting from our general’s\r\nfrivolity, carelessness and incapacity.”[192] Later in the evening,\r\nwhen the time came for Juliette to return home, she found the tumult\r\nhad increased. As she pressed her way through the crowd she felt its\r\nsentiments possessing her. “My sorrows mingled with theirs,” she\r\nwrites, “my patriotism with their patriotism.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as she saw Adam she warned him of the state of Paris. But\r\nhe knew it better than she, and her warning was unnecessary. There\r\nwas a dinner-party at the Préfecture that evening. Both at table\r\nand afterwards in her salon, the guests, among whom was Rochefort,\r\ncomplained as loudly as the crowd of the Government’s incapacity.\r\nEvery one found fault with the mismanagement which had resulted in\r\nthe loss of Le Bourget. Rochefort and Adam were obliged to leave to\r\nattend a Cabinet meeting,[193] held to receive the report of Thiers,\r\nwho had just returned from an official visit to the Great Powers on\r\nthe subject of an armistice. Adam did not come back to the Préfecture\r\nuntil three o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe news that he brought was of the gravest. The Prefect of the Police\r\nplaced no reliance whatever on the repeated assurances of the Governor\r\nof Paris that he would maintain order. Juliette had long since lost\r\nall faith in that polished, placid person, of whom every one said,\r\n_c’est un homme très distingué_. She would have preferred an energetic\r\ncorporal.[194] She had no faith in the famous “plan.” It had never\r\nbeen confided to any one; but already it was being ridiculed by the\r\nbesieged in the following couplets, sung up and down Paris streets—\r\n\r\n    “Je sais le plan de Trochu,\r\n    Plan, plan, plan, plan, plan.\r\n    Mon Dieu! quel beau plan!\r\n    Je sais le plan de Trochu;\r\n    Grâce à lui rien n’est perdu!\r\n    Quand sur du beau papier blanc,\r\n    Il eut écrit son affaire,\r\n    Il alla porter son plan\r\n    Chez maître Ducloux, notaire—\r\n    C’est là, qu’est l’plan de Trochu,\r\n    Plan, plan, plan, plan, plan.\r\n    Mon Dieu! quel beau plan!\r\n    C’est là, qu’est l’plan de Trochu;\r\n    Grâce à lui rien n’est perdu!”\r\n\r\nMost happily, as it turned out, Adam had resolved on taking his own\r\nmeasures in order to guard peaceful citizens from the forces of\r\nviolence and disorder. He depended on the Gardes Mobiles, recruited\r\nin the provinces. The Garde Nationale could not be trusted. It would\r\nprobably side with the populace. And a parade of regular troops would\r\nonly irritate the malcontents.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers, after the Cabinet meeting, had taken Adam apart and\r\nconfided to him his fear that the mob, furious against Thiers for his\r\nattempt to negotiate an armistice, might attack his house on the Place\r\nSt. Georges and endanger the lives of his old, faithful servants. Adam\r\npromised to have the house guarded. And he now requested Juliette in\r\ncase of danger to bring his friend’s servants into the Préfecture.\r\n\r\nNeither sleep nor rest was possible for the Préfet de Police that\r\nnight: reports from various parts of Paris were coming in every moment.\r\n\r\nBetween seven and eight in the morning Adam brought his wife the\r\nofficial newspaper _L’Officiel_. It contained three items of news,\r\nas little calculated as might be to calm the effervescence of the\r\nParisian populace. It announced the capitulation of Metz and the\r\npossibility of an armistice, and it confirmed what had only been\r\nrumoured the day before, the Prussian capture of Le Bourget.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect went off at once to consult Trochu as to the measures for\r\ncontrolling the manifestation of popular fury which would be sure to\r\ngreet these disastrous announcements. He found the general, as usual,\r\nirresolute—one moment proclaiming that the Government nominated by\r\npublic opinion must find therein its only support, the next declaring\r\nthat a hostile manifestation must be met by a deployment of all the\r\nforces at the Government’s disposition. Determining to give his own\r\ninterpretation to such contradictory instructions, Adam assembled\r\ntwenty battalions of the Garde Nationale to defend the Hôtel de Ville.\r\nThither he himself went about one o’clock. Juliette did not see him\r\nagain until six. Overcome with restlessness and apprehension, Mme.\r\nAdam spent the afternoon with some friends at Romainville Fort, whence\r\ncould be seen the lost Le Bourget. Returning through Belleville about\r\nfour o’clock, they found the suburb in a state of extreme agitation.\r\nAngry crowds thronged the streets, vociferating loudly: “We won’t\r\nhave an armistice. All our men must engage. Rather blow up Paris than\r\nsurrender.”[195]\r\n\r\nRound the Hôtel de Ville the crowd was so dense that it was impossible\r\nfor the carriage to pass. Alighting, Juliette mingled with the people\r\nand asked, “What was happening?” The replies she received were so\r\ncontradictory that she could learn nothing. From the windows of the\r\nHôtel de Ville lists were being thrown out, containing the names,\r\ncuriously assorted, of those who were being proposed for the new\r\nGovernment: on one list were Victor Hugo, Louis Blanc, Ledru-Rollin,\r\nDelescluze; on another, Blanqui, Delescluze, Flourens, Félix Peyrat.\r\nEvery list contained the name of Dorian, an intimate friend of the\r\nAdams, the highly popular and capable Minister of Public Works. On one\r\npaper was written merely _Commune décrétée, Dorian président_.[196]\r\nMingling in that self-same crowd were other distinguished diarists\r\nof the siege: Labouchère, then Paris correspondent for the _Daily\r\nNews_, and Edmond de Goncourt, both of whom observed that list-making.\r\nDe Goncourt saw workmen in round hats inscribing in pencil on thick\r\nwriting-pads a list which was being dictated to them.[197] He caught\r\nthe names of Blanqui, Flourens, Ledru-Rollin and Motte. “That will do\r\nnow,” cried a workman in a blouse. And de Goncourt next found himself\r\nin a group of women timorously talking of the distribution of goods.\r\n\r\nUp in the Hôtel de Ville, already invaded by the mob, were\r\ndeliberating, in one room, the mayors of Paris, and in another the\r\nGovernment of National Defence.[198]\r\n\r\nWhere was her husband? was naturally Mme. Adam’s chief concern.\r\nFollowing a company of Gardes Nationaux, she penetrated through a\r\nlittle side door into the courtyard of the Hôtel de Ville. There she\r\nsaw Gustave Flourens on horseback. He was a Revolutionist designated\r\nby one of the lists as leader of the Commune.\r\n\r\n_“Ce pauvre Gustave, brave garçon, mais un enfant,”_ murmured at her\r\nside a man who, perspiring freely and breathing deeply, like one who\r\nhad been hustled in a crowd, seemed just to have escaped from the riot\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n“You come from above, sir?” asked Mme. Adam. “What is going on there?”\r\n\r\n“Everything is for the best, my little lady,” he replied. “Blanqui is\r\nproclaimed Dictator of the Commune.”\r\n\r\nJuliette longed to ask about her husband. But she was afraid. She only\r\ndared to inquire—\r\n\r\n“How about Dorian?”\r\n\r\n“What would you have, madame? He himself replied to us, saying, ‛I\r\nrefuse to preside over the Commune. I am no politician. I found\r\ncannon, and, in my opinion, this is a time when the country stands\r\nmore in need of cannons than of insurrections!’”\r\n\r\n“Fine words,” exclaimed Juliette.\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame; take them away with you,” was the rejoinder.\r\n\r\nHoping that Adam had returned to the Préfecture, Juliette made her way\r\nhome, but only to find her husband still absent. He returned, however,\r\nat half-past six. Only a few minutes before, his wife had heard from\r\nthe lips of a friendly National Guard the news of her husband’s\r\narrest and of his escape, which he owed to the good offices of the\r\nnews-bearer. The Prefect had only a few minutes to stay. His wife\r\nspoke of dinner. He would not hear of it. He had come to take measures\r\nfor the defence of the Préfecture. Those measures the events of that\r\nblack, starless night proved to be only too necessary.[199]\r\n\r\nBut they must be read in Mme. Adam’s _Souvenirs_; for the limits of\r\nthis volume require us to pass over them and to hasten on to record\r\nbriefly the agreement which, by the intervention of Adam and his\r\nfriend Dorian, was arrived at in the small hours of the morning.\r\nStanding in a narrow staircase of the Hôtel de Ville, with the angry\r\nriflemen of the Commune above him, and the treacherous National Guards\r\nbelow, the Prefect conducted a parley. This intervention, seconded by\r\nthe negotiations which Dorian in an upper room was carrying on between\r\nthe Government and the Revolutionists, resulted in the signing of a\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nBy this agreement[200] the Government promised three things: first,\r\nto hold municipal elections on the following day; second, political\r\nelections on the day after; third, not to prosecute the leaders of the\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nAfter the signing of this agreement, Adam, having, with considerable\r\ndifficulty, secured the evacuation of the Hôtel de Ville by the\r\ninvaders and the re-establishment of order, returned to the Préfecture\r\nat half-past five on the morning of November 1st.\r\n\r\nBarely had the Prefect thrown himself on his bed and begun to\r\nenjoy the sleep which for two nights had been denied him, when his\r\nwife, who was writing in the adjoining room, heard her husband’s\r\nbedroom door violently opened. This early morning visitor was a\r\nmember of the Government, M. Picard, who came to demand the arrest\r\nof the rebel leaders. Picard and certain of his colleagues, who\r\nhad contrived to escape from the besieged Hôtel de Ville, and who\r\nwere, therefore, absent at the time of the Convention’s signing,\r\nrefused to hold themselves responsible for it. Adam, however, rather\r\nthan break his pledged word, sent in his resignation. Negotiations\r\ncontinued throughout the day. The Prefect was implored to reconsider\r\nhis decision; but he was deaf to all entreaties. His wife, who was\r\nlunching with Mme. Dorian when she first heard the news of her\r\nhusband’s resignation, thoroughly approved of his action, deploring\r\nthe treachery of the Government and its inevitably disastrous effect\r\nupon the people.\r\n\r\nThe question arose as to what should be the attitude of Dorian\r\nhimself. He, as well as Adam, had undertaken that the leaders of the\r\ninsurrection should go free. He, like Adam, was a man of unimpeachable\r\nhonour. But his position was somewhat different. As Minister of Public\r\nWorks he was entrusted with the all-important task of providing with\r\nmunitions the army defending Paris. In his exercise of this function\r\nhe had displayed marvellous ingenuity, energy and organising power.\r\nHe had transformed the goldsmiths of Paris into engineers. He had\r\ncommandeered every possible assistance. He had seemed to create guns\r\nout of nothing.[201]\r\n\r\n“Twenty thousand shells are to-day being turned out,” wrote Mme. Adam,\r\n“in a city where, according to the Ministry of War, all the materials\r\nfor munitions were exhausted.”\r\n\r\nHere was Dorian, the right man in the right place: a minister who, if\r\nhis colleagues had only possessed half his brains and energy, might\r\npossibly have saved Paris. What was he to do? His dignity dictated\r\nresignation. But though modesty itself, he was not blind to his own\r\nworth. He knew what he and he alone could do for his country, and for\r\nthe country he cared far more than for his personal dignity. That day\r\nat lunch his wife, his son, and his beautiful daughter, Aline Dorian,\r\none of the most ardent of patriots, and his daughter’s husband, Paul\r\nMénard, all entreated him to resign.[202] With tears in his eyes and\r\nwithout the slightest hesitation, he replied: “When I left my home and\r\nmy foundries to come to Paris, I was prepared for every sacrifice.\r\nWhen I consented to enter the Government of Defence, I vowed to\r\nthe Republic’s service my fortune, my life, and yours, Ménard, and\r\nyours, Charles. You tell me that I ought to reserve my honour. I do\r\nnot consider that my honour is in question. Rather it is the honour\r\nof others which is at stake. It is my dignity that is attacked. I\r\nfeel it. Nevertheless I will go so far as to make that sacrifice. I\r\nhave carved out my own part in the national task which we are all\r\nperforming. I found cannon. If I ceased to do so, then I am persuaded\r\nnot another cannon, not a single bullet more would be manufactured.”\r\n\r\nDorian continued in office. Adam, as we have said, resigned; and\r\nafter three weeks’ residence in her prison house, Juliette awoke on\r\nthe morning of the 3rd of November to find herself back again in her\r\n“dovecot” of the Boulevard Poissonnière.\r\n\r\nOne of the privations of her sojourn across the water had been that\r\nshe saw less of her friends. The Rue de Jérusalem was too far out of\r\ntheir beat. Now, sauntering along the boulevard, coming away from\r\ndinner at Brébant’s opposite, the Adams’ friends had only to climb\r\ntheir staircase on Wednesday or Friday evenings to find them at home\r\nand surrounded by interesting friends. Of this restored privilege\r\nthe former frequenters of Mme. Adam’s salon were not slow to avail\r\nthemselves. “_Ah! que le salon du Boulevard Poissonnière est autrement\r\nfréquenté que celui de la Préfecture_,” exclaims Juliette. On the 8th\r\nof November she writes: “This evening we have the whole Dorian family,\r\nfor whom our friendship increases every day, also Eugène Pelletan,\r\nRochefort, who had resigned after the 31st of October, Chenevard and\r\nLouis Blanc.”\r\n\r\nAs the siege dragged on and viands grew scarcer and scarcer, Mme. Adam\r\nwas often hard put to it to provide dinners for her guests. They were\r\n_dîners de guerre_, which, of course, means _guère de dîner_.\r\n\r\n“I invited our friends to dinner,” writes Mme. Adam on the 23rd of\r\nDecember. “But our dinners are now veritable picnics.” Jourdan, a\r\nwell-known journalist, provided the butter, Peyrat the last box of\r\nAlbert plums in Paris, another guest a little box of kidney beans, yet\r\nanother had sent the joint—it was part of an interesting cow which\r\nfor two months had been stabled in a salon. A few weeks later such\r\na luxury as beef became quite unknown. Juliette for her New Year’s\r\ndinner-party considered herself lucky to be able to put before her\r\nfriends a joint of elephant. It was part of the famous Castor from\r\nthe Jardins d’Acclimation. The trunk of Castor’s twin, Pollux, which\r\nan English butcher of the Boulevard Haussman had temptingly displayed\r\nin a setting of camel kidneys, helped to furnish forth the war\r\ndinner-tables of Labouchère and Edmond de Goncourt. The _Daily News_\r\ncorrespondent found it tough and oily, _une pièce de résistance_, but\r\nnot in the usual sense of the term.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the rich, however, were as nothing compared with\r\nthose of the poor. They were aggravated by the severity of the winter\r\nand the scarcity of fuel. Guards on the Paris ramparts were found\r\nfrozen stiff.[203] Well-dressed women were to be seen carrying bundles\r\nof faggots along the street, or bearing home in triumph the hoop of a\r\ncask.\r\n\r\nWalking along the Rue St. Honoré, Juliette was terrified to see a\r\nman fall down before her; he had fainted, and was on the point of\r\ndying of starvation. Mme. Adam learned that he was a whipmaker, whose\r\noccupation had forsaken him at a time when carriage-horses fetched a\r\nhigh price as a table delicacy. That day Juliette became possessed of\r\na stock of whips large enough to furnish forth all the chariots of the\r\nOlympic Festival.\r\n\r\n“When my portion of horseflesh is tough,” she writes,[204] “I try to\r\nconsole myself with the thought that it is part of one of those poor\r\nskeletons I used to see beaten almost to death along the streets.\r\nWhen the meat is fat and tender I am always afraid it comes from one\r\nof those fine dapple greys belonging to the Western Railway Line,\r\nwhich you, Alice, loved to watch ascending the slight incline of the\r\nBoulevard Poissonnière.”\r\n\r\nThe fortitude with which all classes in Paris endured the hardships\r\nof the siege Juliette is never tired of extolling. “Not a woman\r\ncomplains,” she writes. “The prevailing idea is devotion to _la\r\npatrie_. _C’est une si grande chose que la patrie quand on y pense_,”\r\nexclaimed a working man whom she met in the street.\r\n\r\nOf course there were ugly scenes: ferocity resulting from the pangs\r\nof hunger, wild lawlessness arising from the relaxation of the\r\nbonds of family discipline in a time of so much distress. Juliette,\r\nwith an idealist’s determination in an hour of heroic struggle to\r\nsee only what is best in her fellow-men, passes lightly over such\r\nincidents, leaving them for de Goncourt’s more realistic pen. She was\r\neven prepared to condone drunkenness, because it frequently arose\r\nfrom scarcity of food.[205] Nevertheless, she cannot refrain from\r\nremonstrating with an intoxicated National Guard. “I cannot bear to\r\nsee a citizen of the Republic drunk,” she exclaimed. “The Republic!\r\n... a citizen! ... no, I will never get tipsy again,” hiccuped the\r\ndrunkard.[206]\r\n\r\nThe artists, the actors and actresses of Paris were among those who\r\nlaboured hardest at doing their bit. “You would expect it of them,”\r\nwrites Mme. Adam. They had been so far from becoming Buonapartiste.\r\nAnd she relates how Mme. Sarah Bernhardt, who had organised a hospital\r\nin the Odéon Theatre, _se conduit en femme de grand cœur_.\r\n\r\nJuliette herself, by her untiring efforts to alleviate distress, won\r\nfor herself the title of _Notre Dame de Bon Secours_. Besides having\r\nbilleted on her three recruits from Auvergne, she nursed back to\r\nhealth in her flat a wounded convalescent soldier, and later, during\r\nthe bombardment, she gave harbourage to a poor girl who had fled in\r\npanic from the outskirts of the city.\r\n\r\nMuch of Mme. Adam’s time was occupied in organising and directing two\r\nsocieties, _L’Œuvre des Fourneaux_, which provided the poor with cheap\r\nmeals, and _L’Œuvre du Travail des Femmes_, destined to help poor\r\nsempstresses by enabling them to possess sewing-machines of their own.\r\n\r\nWith amazing endurance, though racked by her old enemies neuralgia\r\nand rheumatism, Mme. Adam kept up her energy and her spirits. For\r\nnine years she had been accustomed to spend the winter in the south.\r\nIn November 1870 she had written: “In normal days we should now be\r\npreparing to go to Bruyères.” But, alas! for her there was to be\r\nno southern sunshine that winter. Such a deprivation alone could\r\nnaturally not fail to tell upon her health. Then came, on the 2nd of\r\nDecember, the terrible disappointment of Champigny, the sortie which\r\nhad raised so many hopes only to dash them to the ground. But it was\r\nnot until January that Juliette was driven to admit to herself that\r\nshe was ill and must stay in bed. The bombardment of Paris had begun\r\non the 6th of January. It continued for a nightmare of three weeks.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 7th of November, Nefftzer, at no time a prophet of\r\nsmooth things, had foretold the bombardment. He predicted that bombs\r\nmight fall even on the centre of Paris, probably on the Institute.\r\n\r\n“Am I afraid?” Juliette had written in her diary under that date.\r\n\r\n“Well, no. Why should I fear a bombardment? The quarters not struck\r\nand not likely to be must receive the unfortunate inhabitants of those\r\nthat are. As for the houses! By my faith! so much the worse for them!\r\nI would willingly sacrifice my own and a hundred others if it would\r\nenable us to hold out two days longer.”[207]\r\n\r\nThe bombardment was less imminent than the editor of the _Temps_ had\r\nthought. When it began on the 6th of January, it took the Parisians\r\nby surprise. The invaders, with a disregard of international law to\r\nwhich we in these latter days have grown accustomed, omitted to give\r\nthe usual warning. “Oh, the barbarians,” cries Juliette. “More than\r\nthree thousand bombs have fallen round the Jardin des Plantes and the\r\nLuxembourg.... Several persons have been killed in their beds.... Many\r\nflew into a panic, and, instead of seeking refuge in cellars, rushed\r\nout into the streets, where they were killed.”[208]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the courage of the Parisians did not waver.... “If the\r\nEuropean capitals,” writes Mme. Adam, “ask how Paris, the gay, the\r\nlight-hearted, the witty, takes this bombardment, let them know Paris\r\nis proud to be bombarded! Let them look at her, let them behold her\r\ncalm, courageous, and let them try to emulate her.”[209]\r\n\r\nExperts pronounced the bombardment to be unheard-of in its violence\r\nand fury. The Prussians appeared to be using up all their siege\r\nammunitions in this final coup. Forty thousand kilogrammes of powder\r\nwere said to have been fired on the plateau of Avron alone. The\r\nnoise was infernal. The tumult and the cold together were maddening.\r\n“Impossible,” wrote Mme. Adam after an interval of a week, “to sleep,\r\nto rest even for a moment. Parisians have not slept for ten days. The\r\nbombardment is fearful. How glad I am that I sent my daughter away!”\r\n\r\nA gleam of hope came to the besieged when, on the 18th of January,\r\nanother attempt was made at a sortie, and when, on the following day,\r\ncame the news that all was going well, that Montretout had been taken,\r\nthat the Prussians had been everywhere repulsed.\r\n\r\n“All Paris at three o’clock in the afternoon was out on the boulevards\r\nand in the Champs Elysées. The Garde Nationale was said to be fighting\r\nmagnificently, and already to have entered the Buzenval Park. Then\r\nsuddenly the appearance of a startling placard cast down from the\r\nheights of sanguine anticipation into the depths of black despair the\r\nspirits of that hopeful and expectant crowd. Trochu announced that the\r\nattack had been abandoned. Instead of declaring a victory he referred\r\nto an armistice, and demanded that every cab remaining in Paris should\r\nbe sent out to bring in the wounded. Groans escaped from every breast.\r\n\r\n“Another enterprise, elaborately prepared, inefficiently executed,\r\nmiserably terminated,” exclaims Mme. Adam. Indeed, an identical\r\ndescription might be given of every sortie since the opening of the\r\nsiege.\r\n\r\nThe talk of capitulation which now began to circulate was unendurable\r\nto Juliette and to those who, like her, had come to be nicknamed _les\r\nà l’Outrance_ (to the bitter end). “Never,” she writes, “during all\r\nthe cruellest trials of these last months, have I suffered more than\r\nat this moment.”[210]\r\n\r\nAll Paris and the twenty mayors of Paris and the Garde Nationale were\r\nof Mme. Adam’s way of thinking: they also were _les à l’Outrance_;\r\nthey preferred death to surrender. “If the Prussians dare to defile\r\ndown our boulevards,” writes Juliette, “I believe we shall do as the\r\nRussians did in Moscow.... Death is twenty times less cruel than the\r\ndegradation of _la patrie_.”[211]\r\n\r\nThe Paris mayors, convoked by the Government to receive the\r\nannouncement that further resistance was impossible, declared they\r\nwere ready to die. They preferred the horrors of famine to the\r\nhumiliation of surrender.[212]\r\n\r\nMany of the terrors of famine the Parisians had already endured. They\r\nhad already suffered the pangs of hunger. But those that awaited them,\r\nshould this heroic recommendation be adopted, would be unspeakably\r\nmore horrible. “The men who speak thus,” wrote Favre in his last\r\ndispatch to Gambetta,[213] “still eat. They endure misery; but they do\r\njust contrive to maintain life. On the day, and that day is imminent,\r\nwhen they have nothing but horseflesh, not even bread, the death-rate,\r\nnow terribly high, will become too horrible.”\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of January one of the Adams’ friends announced in their\r\nsalon that the food in Paris could not hold out for longer than two\r\ndays. That was an exaggeration. Juliette maintained that it could last\r\nfor fifteen. Jules Favre informed Gambetta that it might be made to\r\nsuffice for ten.[214]\r\n\r\nHad there been any chance of the capital’s deliverance by one of the\r\narmies which Gambetta had been organising in the provinces, then the\r\nGovernment might have been justified in holding out a few days longer,\r\nbut the last hope of such a deliverance had faded when General Chanzy\r\nhad been defeated on the 11th.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Juliette, dragging herself from her sick-bed out into the\r\nbitter January cold, spent the 21st visiting first one, than another,\r\nin the forlorn hope of inspiring some concerted anti-surrender\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n“I have passed a horrible night,” she wrote on the 24th, “obsessed by\r\nhallucinations. The Republic, our France, taking to itself form and\r\nvisage, appeared and spoke to me, called me....”[215]\r\n\r\n“The _Officiel_ this morning insults our grief. What! Our hearts\r\nare bleeding! ... the whole population of Paris is in despair, in\r\ntears!... And yet not a word, not a groan, not a cry escapes from\r\nthe breasts of those who govern us. Would not M. Picard[216] and M.\r\nVinoy[217] permit it?”\r\n\r\nThe armistice involving the surrender of Paris was signed on the 28th\r\nof January. The bombardment had ceased on the 26th. “Would that I\r\ncould die at this hour,” wrote Mme. Adam.[218]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[189] _Souvenirs_, IV. 88.\r\n\r\n[190] Sarcey, _Le Siège de Paris_, Eng. trans., 250.\r\n\r\n[191] _Souvenirs_, IV. 143.\r\n\r\n[192] _Souvenirs_, IV. 150.\r\n\r\n[193] The Government usually met in the evening at nine o’clock, and\r\nthe sessions always continued until after midnight, sometimes till two\r\nor three in the morning. “From the 4th of September till the 8th of\r\nFebruary we never missed a day, and often we had additional meetings,”\r\nwrites Jules Favre (_Gouvernement de la Défense Nationale_, I. 215).\r\n\r\n[194] _Souvenirs_, IV. 89.\r\n\r\n[195] _Souvenirs_, IV. 161.\r\n\r\n[196] Labouchère, _A Resident besieged in Paris_, 161.\r\n\r\n[197] See de Goncourt, _Journal_ under October 31, 1870.\r\n\r\n[198] A vivid description of the proceedings inside the Hôtel de Ville\r\nis given by Labouchère, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n[199] _Souvenirs_, IV. 167-87.\r\n\r\n[200] The Revolutionists were discontented with the Provisional\r\nGovernment’s regulation of municipal affairs.

But by an arrangement between Favre and\r\nBismarck the bombardment closed two days before the signing of the\r\ncapitulation. See Jules Favre, _Gouvernement de la Défense Nationale_,\r\nII. 403.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNE\r\n\r\n1871\r\n\r\n     “_Cette Commune qui venait de faire sombrer le Paris héroique dans\r\n     le Paris sanglant et incendiaire._”—Mme. Adam, _Souvenirs_.\r\n\r\n        “In each human heart terror survives\r\n  The ravin it has gorged.”—Shelley, _Prometheus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor five months France had been ruled by an oligarchy. The ministers\r\nwho took office on the 4th of September were responsible to no\r\nparliament. No legislative body had succeeded the Corps Legislatif,\r\nthe members of which, as we have seen, had unceremoniously quitted\r\nthe Palais Bourbon on that autumn Sunday which saw the birth of the\r\nGovernment of National Defence.\r\n\r\nBut now at the conqueror’s bidding there was to be a National\r\nAssembly. A clause in the Capitulation of Paris stipulated for its\r\nelection. Accordingly, throughout France, even in the departments\r\noccupied by the enemy, elections were held on the 8th of February.\r\nThey resulted in the return to “Bismarck’s Parliament,” as Mme.\r\nAdam called the National Assembly which on the 12th of February met\r\nat Bordeaux, of about one hundred and eighty republicans—radicals\r\nand moderates being almost equal—of about four hundred and fifty\r\nmonarchical conservatives, legitimists and Orleanists being about\r\nequal, and finally of thirty Buonapartists.[219]\r\n\r\n“The final result of the elections,” writes Mme. Adam,[220] “is\r\nheartrending. The majority is reactionary, nominated in order to make\r\npeace. Country gentlemen and _capitulards_ will vote it. It is the\r\nchamber Bismarck desired. He assisted at its nomination. He presided\r\nover the elections. In certain towns did not the Prussians themselves\r\ndistribute the voting papers on behalf of the reactionary candidates?\r\nBismarck is determined that the war shall end. Germany has had enough\r\nof it.... Coblentz has returned under another form. Only now it is at\r\nhome and not abroad that Frenchmen have made a compact with the enemy.\r\nOld valiant France is dying, is dead.”\r\n\r\nMme. Adam was now at Bruyères. Her husband had been nominated as\r\ncandidate for a Paris constituency and for Les Alpes Maritimes.\r\nContrary to his wife’s advice he had insisted on leaving his Paris\r\nelection to look after itself while he went to Nice. He had started on\r\nthe 2nd of February, leaving Juliette, as she pathetically puts it,\r\n_en tête-à-tête, avec la pensée de ma pauvre chère France vaincue,\r\nmutilée, broyée_.[221]\r\n\r\nA few days after her husband’s departure, to her grief and loneliness\r\nwas suddenly added the most agonising apprehension. She read in the\r\nnewspaper that her husband’s train carrying twenty thousand kilos\r\nof gunpowder had been blown up. Hastily gathering together a few\r\nvaluables, which, considering the disordered state of the capital,\r\nshe dare not leave in Paris, she was about to start for the south,\r\nwhen a friend arrived with the welcome news that her husband was alive\r\nthough seriously injured. A few hours later, accompanied by her dear\r\nlittle friend Bibi, Rochfort’s eight-year-old son, who was staying\r\nwith her at the time, Mme. Adam was in the train. The journey was\r\nterrible. Constantly she was confronted with Prussian soldiers, who\r\ninsisted on seeing her papers. “_Ils me demandent d’un ton rude mon\r\nlaissez-passer. Celui qui me le rend touche ma main. Je frissonne\r\ncomme au contact d’une bête venimeuse_,”[222] she writes.\r\n\r\nArrived at Cannes, she is disappointed to find instead of Adam at the\r\nstation a note brought by the coachman, explaining that her husband’s\r\nelectoral duties detained him at Nice, but that he will be home for\r\ndinner. This disappointment, at the end of a long, fatiguing journey,\r\nexasperated her. “I would have gone back to Paris at once if I could,”\r\nshe writes.\r\n\r\nAnd Adam, when he returned, was treated to one of those _drames de\r\nfamille_ which Juliette herself had so often witnessed in her youth.\r\nThe scene, as Mme. Adam describes it in her _Souvenirs_, might strike\r\nthe reader as somewhat brutal. But one must read between the lines,\r\nand remember Juliette’s overwrought condition. Then it is easy to see\r\nhow it came about; how at that moment the sight of Adam’s poor scarred\r\nface, recalling how he had been on the brink of death, would make\r\nhis wife furious to think of his disregard of her entreaties and his\r\npersistence in undertaking that disastrous journey.\r\n\r\n“How could you have gone off like that, leaving me the sole guardian\r\nof our fortune?” she cried. “Why must you insist on pursuing this\r\nvisionary Nice candidature, risking failure in Paris, where, but for\r\nme and Rochefort, you would never have been elected?” Fortunately Adam\r\nthoroughly understood his wife. Realising the strain already put upon\r\nher nerves, he indulged in no self-justification, but assumed the\r\nonly possible attitude—one of lamb-like submission. Nevertheless, her\r\nagitation distressed him, and two big tears coursed slowly down his\r\nlacerated face.\r\n\r\n“I am in favour of his being pardoned,” sententiously pronounced\r\nthe comical little Bibi. Bibi’s advice was taken; and “_nous dînons\r\nappaisés_,” writes Mme. Adam. After dinner her husband told the story\r\nof his miraculous escape.[223]\r\n\r\n“In a few days when his wounds had somewhat healed he left for\r\nBordeaux. There the Assembly had already held its first meeting. Its\r\ninitial act had been to nominate Thiers President of the Republic,\r\nor, to be more exact, _chef du pouvoir executif de la République\r\nFrançaise_. In spite of his three-and-seventy years _le petit\r\nbourgeois_ was still in the perfection of health and vigour. He could\r\nstill say to the friends who gathered round him: _C’est nous qui\r\nsommes encore les jeunes aujourd’hui_.” Chateaubriand used to call\r\nThiers the “heir of the future” (_l’héritier de l’avenir_). That\r\nfuture had now arrived. During his retirement from public affairs in\r\nthe early days of the Empire it had been prophesied of him that only\r\na great national disaster would draw him from his obscurity. Now that\r\nthe disaster had occurred, everyone turned to _le petit grand homme_\r\nas the only man in France capable of confronting Bismarck and facing\r\nall the growing difficulties of an almost desperate situation. It was\r\nto those difficulties that the third Republic owed its proclamation.\r\nFor at first sight it seems incredible that an assembly in which\r\nmonarchists had a substantial majority should decree a Republic. But\r\nneither legitimists nor Orleanists desired to assume the terrible\r\nresponsibilities which would obviously devolve on the new ministers:\r\nto restore the monarchy under such circumstances, when the new king’s\r\nfirst act would be to sign the dismemberment of France, would be to\r\ndiscredit for ever the monarchical _régime_.\r\n\r\nThiers, though holding himself aloof from all parties and adopting no\r\nlabel save one, “_La France_,” was said to have Orleanist leanings.\r\nThat is probable. Nevertheless, he realised that only a republic was\r\nfeasible, because, as he said, “it is the form of government which\r\ndivides us least.”[224]\r\n\r\nMme. Adam, although at this time of her life she was no admirer\r\nof Thiers, refrains from inveighing against the presidency of her\r\nhusband’s friend. She felt under no such constraint, however, with\r\nregard to the chief ministers of his cabinet: Jules Favre, who\r\ncontinued Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Ernest Picard, Minister\r\nof the Interior. “_Deux clairvoyances, deux compétences rares ...\r\ncomme insuffisance_,”[225] she writes. She knew them both well. They\r\nwere both habitués of her salon. She could never forgive Favre for\r\nhaving negotiated the capitulation of Paris. And she is not alone\r\nin censoring the terms of that surrender. Neither our Ambassador in\r\nParis, Lord Lyons, nor Labouchère,[226] had a high opinion of Favre’s\r\ndiplomatic gifts. “He is too much led away by his feelings,” wrote\r\nLord Lyons to Lord Granville.[227] “He is essentially an orator rather\r\nthan a statesman,” was Labouchère’s opinion. “When he went to meet\r\nBismarck at Ferrières he was fully prepared to agree to the fortresses\r\nin Alsace and Lorraine being rased; but, when he returned, the phrase\r\n_ni un pouce du territoire, ni une pierre des fortresses_ occurred\r\nto him, and he could not refrain from complicating the situation by\r\npublishing it.”[228] M. Gabriel Hanotaux[229] marvels to think how a\r\nman whose intelligence was so mediocre, whose character was so weak,\r\ncould ever have risen to a position of such authority.\r\n\r\nThe historian of contemporary France also shares Mme. Adam’s opinion\r\nof the Minister of the Interior, Picard. “_Bourgeois de Paris, homme\r\ngras et de teint fleuri, orateur élégant et fin, esprit sceptique\r\net dépris, il savait trouver de mots heureux_,” is M. Hanotaux’s\r\ndescription of the new Home Secretary.[230] “_Il ne vise qu’aux mots\r\nd’esprit_,”[231] writes Mme. Adam.\r\n\r\nJules Grévy, the eminent lawyer, who was now President of the New\r\nChamber, had in the days of her matrimonial difficulties been\r\nJuliette’s guide, counsellor and friend, placing at her disposal all\r\nthat _sagesse pondérée_, that _finesse matoise_,[232] with which this\r\nideal _bourgeois_ was so plentifully endowed. When she had first met\r\nhim in Mme. d’Agoult’s salon, Grévy, like herself, was a republican\r\n_abstentioniste_, detached from any participation in the hated\r\nimperial _régime_. Mme. Adam had never forgiven him for abandoning\r\nthat position, for yielding to Ollivier’s persuasions and entering the\r\nCorps Legislatif as one of the famous “five,” the first republicans\r\nto take the oath of allegiance to the Empire. “For me, henceforth,”\r\nshe said to Adam, “Grévy is no longer a man whose political honour is\r\nintact.”[233]\r\n\r\nThese various appointments and other news sent by Adam from Bordeaux,\r\nhis wife at Bruyères discussed at length with Thiers’ old friend, her\r\nneighbour, Dr. Maure, and with M. and Mme. Arlès Dufour, who had come\r\nto cheer her loneliness. Her mornings were spent in teaching her young\r\nfriend Bibi. But all the while her heart was rent by maternal as well\r\nas national anxiety. For weeks she had had no news of Alice.\r\n\r\n“All my friends speak of my daughter,” she writes; “she will soon\r\nbe with you, they assure me. And the days and the hours pass, and\r\nsilence, horrible silence, weighs upon me, broken only by the wailings\r\nof my patriotic grief.”\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 26th of February, Thiers and Jules Favre had signed the\r\npreliminaries of peace at Versailles. The next morning, as Mme. Adam\r\nwas giving Bibi his geography lesson, she wept to see lying before\r\nher the map of France, the tangible image of her adored and mutilated\r\n_patrie_.\r\n\r\n“Why are you crying?” asked Bibi. He also cried when he heard the\r\nreason, and said: “They are taking from us the heart of France.”\r\n\r\nAdam wrote briefly announcing the terms of the treaty. “_Vae victis!_\r\nI send you the text of the treaty which M. de Bismarck has dictated.\r\n‛Session of the whole of Alsace, except Belfort. Session of a part\r\nof Lorraine with Metz. Five milliards indemnity. Entrance into Paris\r\non the 1st of March of 30,000 Prussians through the Arc de Triomphe\r\nand as far as the Place de la Concorde, until the ratification of the\r\ntreaty.’\r\n\r\n“Such is our fate, Juliette. It is horrible. The stories of Bismarck’s\r\ninsolence are ghastly. Indignation is universal. Nevertheless, the\r\nmajority will vote for peace. Will the minority be large enough to\r\nshow the Prussians that their victory might have been disputed?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Every one is afraid of what may happen in Paris when the Prussians\r\nenter. Chanzy[234] said just now in my presence: ‘I have thought it\r\nover well. It will be better to resume hostilities. There is still a\r\nchance of our being able to pull ourselves together. I shall certainly\r\nfeel justified in voting against the treaty of peace.’”[235]\r\n\r\nAdam interrupted his letter to go and vote. The poor little minority\r\nwas miserable—only 107 against 546 votes in favour of peace. Then in\r\nheartrending terms Adam proceeds to describe the famous protest of\r\nthe twenty-five deputies of Alsace-Lorraine, and Grosjean’s sorrowful\r\nleave-taking uttered on their behalf and terminating with the words:\r\n“We shall ever cherish with a filial affection France absent from our\r\nhearths until the day when she returns to her place there.”\r\n\r\n“I have always foreseen it,” writes Mme. Adam. “From the day of\r\nsurrender I had grieved over that shameful, cowardly peace. The France\r\nI idolize! Now she sees torn from her those provinces which our\r\nhusbands and our sons might have preserved.... The days may pass and\r\nyears be added unto them, but never, until the hour strikes for the\r\ndeliverance of our brethren now handed over to Prussia, will the wound\r\nI receive to-day be healed.”[236]\r\n\r\nThe Treaty signed by Thiers and Jules Favre at Versailles was ratified\r\nby the Bordeaux Assembly on the 1st of March. Henceforth there was no\r\nreason why the Parliament should not return northwards.\r\n\r\n“Just now,” wrote Adam to his wife,[237] “Thiers opened the question\r\nof the town in which the Assembly shall deliberate. He is resolved to\r\nleave Bordeaux immediately. This is foolish, unless he is prepared to\r\nreturn at once to Paris.”\r\n\r\nBut the conservative majority of the Assembly was averse to carrying\r\non their deliberations in the capital. Paris they regarded as the\r\nhot-bed of revolution, creating a new government and imposing it by\r\ntelegraph[238] on the rest of France every fifteen years. For the\r\nfirst time in French history a great gulf had opened between Paris\r\nand the provinces. Bourges and Fontainebleau were both suggested as\r\nsuitable meeting-places. But the choice finally fell on Versailles,\r\nwhose monarchical associations harmonised so well with the hopes\r\ncherished by the party in majority at Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nLouis Blanc, one of the deputies for Paris, loudly protested against\r\nthis decision. Thus to abandon Paris, he argued, would be to drive the\r\nmetropolis to create a government of its own. Alas! _cette vieille\r\nbarbe_ of 1848 proved only too true a prophet. This slight put upon\r\nParis was partly responsible for the institution of the Commune and\r\nall the horrors of civil war which followed. For the Government to\r\nturn its back upon Paris was not a measure likely to placate the\r\ndiscontent with which the city was seething, or to soothe the nerves\r\nof the heroic town all unstrung by the horrors of the siege.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly held its last meeting at Bordeaux on the 11th of\r\nMarch. The Versailles session was to open on the 20th. By that time\r\nParis was in open insurrection; and the President, who on leaving\r\nBordeaux had with his ministers taken up his residence within the\r\ncapital, deemed it expedient to decamp to Versailles. The declaration\r\nthat the Commune _est le pouvoir unique, son autorité est absolu_\r\nappeared in the _Officiel_ on the 26th.\r\n\r\n“Between Paris and Versailles,” wrote Adam to his wife, “there is\r\nsomething more than the Great Wall of China, there is something\r\nmore than a hundred leagues, there is a hundred years, a whole\r\ncentury.”[239] Nevertheless, throughout those hideous two months from\r\nthe outbreak of insurrection to the fall of the Commune at the end of\r\nMay, Edmond Adam, deputy of Paris, braving the dangers of arrest and\r\nexecution, continued to pass to and fro, between the revolted city\r\nand Versailles, ever hoping that he might be able to facilitate some\r\ncompromise between the rival authorities. From an interview with his\r\nold friend Thiers, however, he derived no encouragement. He feared\r\nthat the President’s chief desire was to appear in the eyes of the\r\nworld as conqueror of provincial France and of the Revolution at\r\nParis.[240]\r\n\r\nOf her husband’s attitude Mme. Adam strongly approved. “You owe it to\r\nParis,” she wrote. “For to Paris you are indebted for everything since\r\nthe day when you first joined the staff of the _National_. Paris has\r\nchosen you for its representative. Paris, though misguided, is well\r\nworth the risk you are running for her.”[241]\r\n\r\nBut Juliette longed to share her husband’s dangers. Alice, after weeks\r\nof agonising suspense, had been restored to her. “Alice and Bibi might\r\nwell,” she wrote to Adam, “be left in the care of M. and Mme. Arlès\r\nDufour,” _le père_ and _la mère_, as Juliette called them, who were\r\nstill at Bruyères. For was it not the place of a deputy’s wife to be\r\nat his side in the city which had elected him? Banished from Adam and\r\nfrom her friends her exile was intolerable. But her husband replied\r\nthat he could not endure the anxiety of her presence in Paris; that\r\nwhile he was obliged to be at Versailles the thought of her in the\r\nrevolted city, a prey to the horrors of that terrific insurrection,\r\nwould drive him mad. “My only strength,” he continued, “arises from\r\nthe thought that you are far from the terrible events which threaten\r\nus. Our friends think it is the end of the world. But I am resolved,\r\neven in this cataclysm, not entirely to despair. In all the darkness\r\nand chaos, I seem to discern a ray of hope. As for us, deputies of a\r\ncapital in insurrection, our situation becomes terrifically difficult.\r\nI am on the boulevard this evening. But shall I be to-morrow? Every\r\none is trying to persuade me to abandon my daily journey, which is so\r\nlikely to be interrupted either at Paris or at Versailles.”\r\n\r\nWhile feeling that no reproach was too bitter to bring against the\r\nleaders of the Commune, against those who, under the conqueror’s very\r\neye, had let loose the rabid hounds of civil war, with Paris and the\r\nrank and file of Parisians Mme. Adam never ceased to sympathise. “Most\r\nof the Communards,” she writes, “... are possessed by the madness\r\nof defeat, a madness which I understand, for I have suffered from\r\nit myself at the close of the siege. In that madness there is no\r\ncowardice. It consists rather in a passionate desire to assert, no\r\nmatter where and how, the courage one has acquired, the courage which\r\ntraitors have neglected to utilise.”[242]\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the Adams throughout these weeks shows\r\nhusband and wife in complete agreement. It also reveals great\r\nmoderation and a desire to see both sides of many difficult questions.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the last days of May, as we have said, that Mme.\r\nAdam returned to Paris, to a Paris desolated by two bombardments, by\r\nferocious street-fighting and by the madness of a defeated mob, raging\r\nthroughout the days and nights of a hideous week of explosions and\r\nincendiarism. Mme. Adam returned to find the blackened ruins of the\r\nTuileries, the smoking ashes of the Hôtel de Ville, a heap of stones\r\nin the square where the Vendôme Column had stood.\r\n\r\nIn the lives of many strong personalities there comes a crisis, a\r\nparting of the ways, when in a convulsion of the whole being character\r\nand disposition receive a new orientation. For how many is not such\r\na crisis presented by the present war! In the religious world such\r\na revolution is described as conversion. This crisis came to Mme.\r\nAdam through national humiliation and the civil strife which followed\r\nthe catastrophe of 1870. _La patrie’s_ defeat had planted deep in\r\nher nature an antagonism which will doubtless endure to the end.\r\nHenceforth we shall find accentuated more and more strongly in her\r\ncharacter and disposition the irreconcilable note. She had always been\r\nemphatic. She was born to be as fervent a hater as she was an ardent\r\nlover. For her there had never been many open questions. Now in every\r\ncause she espouses she holds the position of _à l’outrance_. The iron\r\nof national defeat and civil war had entered into her soul. On the\r\n30th of October, 1870, on learning the loss of Le Bourget Fort, she\r\nhad written:[243] “I cannot describe the vexation, the discouragement,\r\nthe wrath, the moral perturbation which possess me.” On so patriotic\r\nand fervent a nature as hers these experiences could not fail to\r\nimprint an indelible mark. Her patriotism, as we have repeatedly seen,\r\nhad always been ardent. _Je prétends être Français plus que personne_\r\nwas her own sentiment put into the mouth of the Picard weaver in her\r\nfirst novel, _Mon Village_. After the war, growing with national\r\ndisaster,[244] her patriotism became a consuming fire. Of herself she\r\nmight have written the words she penned of Edmond About: “_il s’est\r\nreveillé de l’horrible cauchemar patriote fanatique_.”[245] “_Votre\r\npatriotisme_,” wrote her friend General Gallifet,[246] “_est peint sur\r\nvos traits et pétille dans votre conversation_.”\r\n\r\nThe Commune had taught her to regard socialism and internationalism\r\nas, after Germany, her country’s most formidable enemies. Her horror\r\nwhen her father proposed to marry her to a working man had shown that\r\nin those early days she was not free from a certain class prejudice.\r\nAn ardent republican, she had believed in fraternity but not in\r\nequality. For her as for Plato the ideal state would be governed by\r\nthe _élite_. Socialism she had ever abhorred. And as the years went\r\non, she came to have less and less faith in the masses. During those\r\ndisturbed months which preceded the war, when, looking down from her\r\nwindow on the Boulevard Poissonnière, she saw Paris workmen (_les\r\nblouses blanches_) holding nightly conferences with policemen, she\r\nhad no doubt of their being _agents provocateurs_. That the Commune’s\r\nexcesses should confirm and aggravate this suspiciousness was\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nHer father’s sympathy with the revolutionists caused her unspeakable\r\ngrief. Dr. Lambert, after sending Alice to Bruyères, had returned to\r\nParis, where he remained to witness and to approve the insurrection.\r\nNothing could ever induce him to blame the communards. He had welcomed\r\nthe movement as the dawn of social regeneration. And for the crimes of\r\nthe rebels he held Thiers and his government responsible. How painful\r\nfor Mme. Adam was all conversation with her father at this time will\r\nreadily be imagined.\r\n\r\nClosely associated with the communards throughout had been members\r\nof “the Internationale,”[247] that vast cosmopolitan organisation,\r\ninspired by Karl Marx and instituted in London in 1862. “The\r\nInternationale” had given its support to the Central Committee which\r\nruled Paris, and it had fully approved of the message sent to the\r\nGerman commander assuring him that the German army had nothing to\r\nfear from the insurrection.[248] Indeed, it seemed to Mme. Adam that\r\nthe Germans had everything to gain from the civil strife then rending\r\nFrance, and that the Communards were simply playing Bismarck’s game.\r\nHad they not purged of danger and disorder other European capitals by\r\ngathering into Paris from London, Rome, Vienna, and Berlin, anarchists\r\nwhose railway fares “seemed to fall like manna from heaven!”[249]\r\n\r\nFor some years, while she had been gradually coming to perceive the\r\ndanger which threatened from German aggression, Mme. Adam had been\r\ngrowing more and more suspicious of the internationalist movement.\r\nWith the Germanising tendencies of Renan, Gaston Paris and other\r\nmembers of her circle she had no sympathy whatever. After the war she\r\ncould not refrain from regarding all internationalists as traitors\r\nto their country.[250] Any sympathy with Germany appeared to her as\r\nnothing short of treason, and treason of the deepest dye. The bonds\r\nof friendship which united her to George Sand were strained almost to\r\nbreaking-point when her friend wrote that she desired peace “not for\r\nthe sake of France alone but for the sake of Germany, and in order to\r\navert the ruin of two civilisations.”\r\n\r\n“This is one of my most cruel sorrows,” wrote Mme. Adam. “A gulf\r\nhas opened between me and the friend whom I adored. Never shall\r\nwe understand one another again. She ... has reverted to the old\r\nhumanitarianism of 1848. She, like my friend Arlès Dufour, permits\r\nherself to be moved by pity for the Germans.”\r\n\r\nHad Mme. Sand witnessed with Juliette all the horrors of the siege,\r\ncould she have maintained that serenity which from henceforth she\r\nnever wearied of preaching to her young friend? “Do not let us be\r\nnervous and agitated,” she writes, “but reasonable, for in that\r\ndirection alone lies the path of duty.”[251] In those days it seemed\r\nto Mme. Adam that this sweet reasonableness was only possible for\r\nthose who had remained aloof from the struggle; and between them and\r\nherself who had lived in the heart of the inferno there was a wide\r\ngulf fixed. How wide she realised painfully when, worn and wan, after\r\nthat terrible railway journey from Paris, she was greeted by her\r\nfriends at Cannes with the words, “Are you not glad to be at Bruyères\r\nonce more?” “Glad!” She was aghast at that word. Yet it accorded\r\nwell with their smiling faces and their perfect health. “But are you\r\npleased that the war is over?” they persisted. “And our defeat?” she\r\ncried. “Do you not realise that it is going to tear out our very\r\nflesh?” And she dismissed them abruptly, horrified to find “French\r\npeople so detached from France.”[252] Later she wrote: “The pure\r\nsouthern sky has never been defiled by the smoke of German bivouacs.\r\nFor the people of Provence the war has been a blood-stained book, but\r\none the pages of which they have hardly turned over.”[253]\r\n\r\nWith Mme. Adam it was very different. For _la grande Française_ “the\r\nterrible year” stands out as the one ineffaceable landmark, dominating\r\nthe whole of her subsequent career.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[219] M.

Il est pour nous la personnification même de la\r\n     France, l’expression vivante et agissante de notre relèvement, de\r\n     nos certitudes républicaines et nationales._”—Juliette Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\nMme. Adam’s attitude towards Gambetta passed through three phases.\r\nDuring the war she regarded him as the incarnation of national\r\ndefence, after the defeat of 1871 as _l’Homme de la Revanche_;\r\nfinally, when _la Revanche_ was delayed she grew first impatient and\r\nthen disappointed with her former hero. It is with the two first of\r\nthese phases that we shall deal in this chapter.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Gambetta had already been admitted to Mme. Adam’s\r\nsalon before the war. But from the opening of the siege until a year\r\nafter the peace they met but seldom if at all. After Gambetta’s\r\ncourageous balloon ascent from Paris, and his safe, if hazardous,\r\nlanding in a wood near Montdidier, all through those darkest days of\r\n_l’Année Terrible_, Juliette Adam derived almost her only consolation\r\nand hope from Gambetta’s dispatches. The energy he was deploying\r\nin his country’s service made her pulse throb with confidence and\r\ncourage. The news brought by carrier pigeon into the besieged capital\r\nof the armies he was creating—Faidherbe’s in the north, Chanzy’s on\r\nthe Loire, Bourbaki’s in the east—seemed almost to compensate for the\r\nindecision and inaction of the defenders of Paris.\r\n\r\n“On the 24th of November,” she wrote,[254] “this morning, I am mad\r\nwith joy, mad with hope. I read and read again Gambetta’s dispatch\r\nto Jules Favre. I bless the great patriot who sends it to us. If\r\nGambetta, a republican, were to save our France! When others doubt him\r\nand his valour, I do not doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Why, we have an army on the Loire two hundred thousand men strong! In\r\na week we shall have another hundred thousand: two hundred thousand\r\nrecruits are clamouring to be on the march. At last!... Long live\r\nFrance! ... and she will live, our _patrie française_. It will not be\r\nso easy to tread upon her. Frenchmen will be found to defend her, to\r\nprevent the invader from pillaging, from defiling her from one end\r\nof the land to the other. It seems to me that all Paris should thank\r\nGambetta. I write to him.”\r\n\r\nAnd when the superb movement of French energy, with which Gambetta\r\nalone had been able to inspire the provinces, seemed to Juliette Adam\r\nto have been nullified by the capital’s submission, she followed her\r\nhero more fervently than ever in his advocacy of war to the bitter\r\nend. She deplored the mistrust and suspicion with which the other\r\nmembers of the September Government regarded _ce fou furieux_, as they\r\ncalled him. She deplored his resignation on the 5th of February, 1871,\r\nof the office of Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nGambetta’s colleagues accused him of ruling France by terror, and\r\nendeavouring to make himself a dictator. To the statesman whom\r\nBismarck regarded as the most superb organiser in Europe, no portfolio\r\nwas assigned in the government Thiers was forming at Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nSo completely out of sympathy with the National Assembly and its\r\nmonarchical majority did Gambetta find himself that, after the signing\r\nof the preliminaries of peace and after he had taken part in that\r\nmemorable protest of the Alsace-Lorraine deputies against the session\r\nof those provinces, he resigned his seat and for some months withdrew\r\nfrom political life.\r\n\r\nOn his return to it, in the summer of 1871, he found his friends, the\r\nAdams, in Paris, and Juliette once more the mistress of a brilliant\r\nand influential political salon. No sooner had she re-established\r\nherself in the Maison Sallandrouze than her friends began to gather\r\nround her once more.\r\n\r\nThe social life of the metropolis was gradually being resumed. But it\r\ntook at least a year before anything like the old brilliance revived.\r\nThe first sign of that revival was when Parisian women began to care\r\nabout clothes. “_Les femmes du siège_,” writes Mme. Adam, “_qui ne\r\nsavaient plus ce que c’était que s’habiller, s’occupaient à nouveau de\r\nleurs robes_,” of course she adds, “_moi la première_.”[255]\r\n\r\nNow once again her Wednesday dinner-parties afforded an occasion for\r\n_grande toilette_. On other evenings any of the Adams’ friends, who\r\nhappened to be passing along the boulevard, were welcome to come\r\nup just as they were. Among those evening callers was more than\r\none well-known Englishman. Mr. Richard Whiteing, in his book _My\r\nHarvest_,[256] paints a vivid picture of Mme. Adam’s salon. He signals\r\nher out as one of those republican women who were reconstructing the\r\nsalon on a Republican basis.\r\n\r\nThe great subjects of discussion on those Wednesday and Friday\r\nevenings were Gambetta’s speeches. Long passages from them were\r\nrecited[257] by Spuller, the deputy who led the most moderate section\r\nof Gambetta’s supporters.[258]\r\n\r\nThen one day in June the orator himself arrived. He had asked to spend\r\nthe evening alone with his hosts. Adam had not seen him since the eve\r\nof his departure from Bordeaux.\r\n\r\n“_Cette soirée_,” writes Juliette,[259] “_a été longue et d’un interêt\r\npassionant_.” While not entirely approving of their friend’s attitude,\r\nof his sympathy with the Commune, for example, the Adams congratulated\r\nhim on his recent speech at Bordeaux.\r\n\r\n“The level-headedness, the wisdom of that speech,” Adam told Gambetta,\r\n“confounded your enemies. You may now group around you a party\r\nrecruited from the left and including a few members of the left\r\ncentre. Juliette and I will be able to contrive for you a certain\r\nunderstanding with the left centre on the great questions of national\r\npolicy.”\r\n\r\nThese words foretold what was to be the rôle of Mme. Adam’s salon in\r\nthe days of its greatest brilliance. As the rallying ground for the\r\nvarious parties of republican opposition to the reactionary majority\r\nin the Assembly, it rendered important service, not only to Gambetta,\r\nbut also to the President (Thiers) in his difficult task of keeping\r\nthe peace between the discordant elements of his nondescript and\r\nessentially provisional Government. Later, after Thiers’ resignation,\r\nduring the days of the _République Militante_ between 1873 and 1876,\r\nMme. Adam’s salon continued to hold together various sections of the\r\nrepublican party: the left centre, the extreme left and the republican\r\nunion, which consisted entirely of Gambetta’s friends. “Our house,”\r\nwrites Mme. Adam, “became very useful to Gambetta. There he met\r\nartists whom he charmed, financiers whom he reassured, political\r\nadversaries whom he enrolled.”[260] Sir Sidney Colvin, who[261] in\r\nthose years was often in Paris for two or three weeks at a time,\r\nused generally to go to her evening receptions, of which he has a\r\nvery distinct recollection. He remembers Mme. Adam as the recognised\r\nEgeria of Gambetta, as very cultivated and intelligent. Obviously she\r\nhad been very beautiful; she was still extremely handsome, and above\r\nall things full of graciousness and tact and good-will—the grace and\r\nthe good-will of a cultivated _bourgeoise_ accustomed to charm and\r\ndetermined to exercise her charm for a cause she had at heart. Sir\r\nSidney used to find it interesting to watch her moving about, the only\r\nlady at her receptions, from some old dry doctrinaire of the Dufaure\r\ngroup to some fiery municipal Radical from the south; among deputies\r\nof all shades, wide asunder as the poles in tradition and feeling\r\nand temperament, and to see her throwing one after another into good\r\nhumour by sheer womanly cordiality and grace.\r\n\r\nIndeed, all who have seen Mme. Adam entertaining her guests will agree\r\nthat she possesses the true salon manner, and that she is mistress of\r\nthat enviable art of talking so as to make others talk.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for his admiration of Gambetta, Edmond Adam would have\r\nthrown in his lot entirely with that section of the republican party\r\nknown as the left centre. “As it was,” writes his wife, “he was to\r\nserve as a hyphen (_à trait d’union_) between the left centre, the\r\nrepublican union and the extreme left. There were those who thought\r\nthat Juliette was chiefly responsible for her husband’s sympathies\r\nwith the extreme wing of the republican party. But this she will not\r\nadmit,[262] though she does not deny that her special friends were\r\nradicals, while Adam’s were moderates. Thiers himself said to Adam one\r\nday, “_Quand votre femme rougit, bleuissez”_. And it is obvious that\r\nJuliette with her impulsive nature not infrequently lost patience with\r\nthe _grandes ombres élyséennes_, as she dubbed Laurent Pichat, Victor\r\nHugo, Louis Blanc, and those other _vieilles barbes_ of 1848 who were\r\nthe mainstay of the left centre. “For them,” she writes, “_République_\r\nis a solemn and pompous word. The young, with Gambetta at their\r\nhead, are more practical and utilitarian.” They desired a government\r\nadapted to the phase of democracy to which France had then attained.\r\nNevertheless, there was nothing commonplace or even opportunist in\r\nthose bright visions of the future Republic which Gambetta painted\r\nin his speeches. “Half smiling,” writes Mme. Adam, “he came straight\r\nto my Athenian Republic.[263]... He desired a France withdrawn into\r\nherself in order to heal her wounds. But when he spoke of her rôle\r\nafter this enforced period of retirement, then he had a vision of\r\nher future prestige, when the army, chief symbol of the country’s\r\nrevival, should be strengthened, glorified every day in order to raise\r\n_la patrie_ from defeat. Then he saw numberless schools educating\r\nthe people—the French schoolmaster playing as prominent a part as\r\nthe German schoolmaster—secularism dissipating all the darkness of\r\nclericalism, liberating thought, correcting the errors of the past,\r\nuntil France, grown great by misfortune, astonished the whole world by\r\nher resurrection.”\r\n\r\nMme. Adam used to complain that in Paris during the first years of the\r\nRepublic, while the National Assembly continued to sit at Versailles,\r\nanything like true sociability was impossible. And it was true that\r\npoor “capitulating Paris” was somewhat shorn of her brightest social\r\nglories. The whole of political society precipitated itself upon\r\nVersailles. On the days when some great oration was expected from\r\nThiers, Dufaure, Batbie or Gambetta, the railway platform at the\r\nGare St. Lazare was thronged, and the carriages in the Versailles\r\ntrain so crowded that it was almost impossible to find a place.\r\nVersailles itself was completely transformed. Never since its royal\r\ndays had it seen such life. It is true that the dull stream of\r\nblack coats flowing along its streets made one long for the gay,\r\nbeplumed, bejewelled courtiers of _le Roi Soleil_. Nevertheless,\r\nthe political whirl of the place was much greater than ever during\r\n_l’ancien régime_. Constituents waylaid deputies in the streets and\r\npoured into their impatient ears whole _cahiers_ of grievances. At the\r\nluncheon and dinner-hour the Hôtel des Réservoirs was packed. It was\r\nnecessary to reserve tables days in advance. And how delightful it was\r\nto sit and sip one’s coffee in the delicious freshness of the park\r\nafter a hot summer afternoon passed in the close atmosphere of the\r\nparliament chamber. In that charming verandah, which many of us know\r\nso well, ministers and deputies met together, while the gay frocks\r\nand the still gayer laughter of their women friends enlivened the\r\nscene. Centuries seemed to have passed since the evil days of _l’Année\r\nTerrible_. Nowhere was the miraculous recuperative force of France\r\nmore striking, never had political society more _entrain_ than during\r\nthose parliament years at Versailles.\r\n\r\nOf that sparkling world Mme. Adam was one of the brightest adornments,\r\none of the gayest _flashers_, as Fanny Burney would have said. Always\r\nperfectly gowned—_elle portrait admirablement la toilette_ was the\r\nopinion of every one—she never missed an important _séance_. After\r\nhaving dined at the Hôtel des Réservoirs in the evening, she would be\r\nat the Gare St. Lazare at nine the next morning; and surrounded by a\r\ncoterie of eminent politicians, who were all in love with her, would\r\nmake the journey to Versailles and take her accustomed place in a box\r\nof the theatre of the Château, which now served as a meeting-place\r\nfor the Assembly. It had been built by Gabriel as an opera-house\r\nfor Louis XIV. While what had been the stage, now shut off from the\r\nmain building, had been converted into a lobby, a mahogany rostrum,\r\napproached by a double staircase of six steps, communicated to the\r\ntheatre of that most autocratic of monarchs something of the air\r\nof a modern parliament house, and the constant movement among the\r\nseven hundred and twenty-eight representatives of the Republic, the\r\nperpetual lifting of the heavy red velvet _portières_ which led into\r\nthe lobby, suggested a political instability quite out of harmony with\r\nthe traditions of _le Grand Monarque_.\r\n\r\nAmong the most striking figures in the Assembly hall were some of\r\nJuliette’s greatest friends. One might easily recognise the Orleanist\r\nMarquis de Lasteyrie by his green eye-shade, M. Jules Simon by his\r\nstudent’s stoop, M. Dufaure by his brown frock-coat, M. Littré by his\r\nblue velvet skull-cap, M. Garnier-Pagès by his famous _faux col_, and\r\nclose by him that “Bull of Bashan of politics,” M. Gambetta,[264] by\r\nhis leonine head and the half-recumbent attitude in which he listened\r\nattentively to every word of the debate.\r\n\r\nGambetta’s first appearance at Versailles in July 1871 was a great\r\npolitical event. At a by-election he had been chosen by three\r\ndepartments, Bouches-du-Rhone, Var and Seine. “The day of his first\r\nspeech,” writes Mme. Adam, “was a day of profound emotion for us,\r\nand of great curiosity for others, who flocked to see the _fou\r\nfurieux_.” In those days Gambetta, though only three-and-thirty,\r\nwas already threatened with that stoutness which, in a man of his\r\nstature, required all the dignity of his strong personality to carry\r\noff. He had not yet, moreover, been taken in hand by Adam’s tailor.\r\nHis black frock-coat, white drill trousers and panama hat made him\r\nappear something of a Tartarin. The unsuitability of his attire would\r\nsometimes diminish the effect of his orations.\r\n\r\nOn the July day when this political Bohemian, emerging from his five\r\nmonths’ retirement, suddenly burst upon the cultivated audience at\r\nVersailles, his power of utterance, his energy of thought, and above\r\nall his unexpected moderation carried every one away.\r\n\r\n“He roared” (_il a rugi_), said the wife of a conservative deputy\r\nwho sat next to Mme. Adam. “Yes,” replied Juliette, “he is a lion.”\r\nThe moment was one when the bishops of France, led by Monseigneur\r\nDupanloup, were petitioning the French Chamber to restore the Pope’s\r\ntemporal power. Gambetta, while unchaining all the fervour of his\r\nanti-clerical wrath, nevertheless supported the government in its\r\nmotion that the question, instead of being discussed by the Assembly,\r\nshould be referred to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. His support of\r\nThiers, whom he and his friends were supposed to regard as nothing but\r\n_un vieillard sinistre_, took every one by surprise. Coming home in\r\nthe train Adam, who was at once the friend of Thiers and of Gambetta,\r\nwas bombarded with questions—\r\n\r\n“Come, Adam, you must be in the know! Are they in agreement? If so,\r\nyou must be acting as intermediary between them.”[265]\r\n\r\nBut Adam shrugged his shoulders and replied: “Alas! I only wish it\r\nwere so. But it is very far from being the case now, or likely to be\r\nin the future.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, Thiers, throughout the difficult months which were to follow,\r\nwas to regard as a serious obstacle in his path Gambetta’s eloquent\r\nadvocacy of _la Revanche_, which so delighted Mme. Adam. For at\r\nthat time Thiers was engaged in those delicate negotiations with\r\nBismarck which culminated in March 1873, in the paying off of the\r\nfive milliards war indemnity, and in the consequent liberation of\r\nFrance from the Prussian occupation almost two years before the time\r\nstipulated by the Treaty of Frankfort.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent consummation, far surpassing the wildest hopes of\r\nthe most sanguine, Thiers beheld constantly endangered by Gambetta’s\r\n_revanchard_ fervour. The President trembled when he heard that to\r\na deputation from Alsace Gambetta had declared that if ever France\r\ndescended to such a depth of impiety as to put away from her the\r\nimage of bleeding, mutilated Alsace, then and then alone might\r\nAlsatians give way to despair.[266] “This is not the moment for such\r\na declaration,” exclaimed Thiers. “Let him wait. Let him wait.” The\r\nPresident was constantly entreating Adam to implore his friend to be\r\nmoderate. His ideas, his speeches in the provinces, were impressing\r\nthe Germans in a manner most unfavourable to the negotiations which\r\nwere proceeding.[267] Never did the Great Tribune appear to Thiers\r\nmore of a _fou furieux_ than during the autumn and winter of 1872\r\nand ’73, when the _commis voyageux de la politique_ (the political\r\ncommercial traveller), as he liked to call himself, was going up\r\nand down France delivering that famous series of speeches, intended\r\nto rouse the provinces to a great burst of republican ardour, which\r\nshould dissolve the reactionary National Assembly, get rid of the\r\ntemporising Thiers, and bring in Gambetta and his friends.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam, despite her respect for Thiers, deeply sympathised with\r\nGambetta’s aims as he declared them in those celebrated orations.\r\nMerely to read Gambetta’s speeches was to lose their finest flavour.\r\nUnlike the speeches of our own Edmund Burke and John Bright, they will\r\nnever be classics. His eloquence, for its full appreciation, so I have\r\nheard Mme. Adam say, required the magic of his presence, the thrill\r\nof his sonorous voice, the dramatic emphasis of his gestures, and the\r\ninspiration of his whole presence.\r\n\r\nOn returning from Venice to Bruyères in the autumn of 1872, she and\r\nAdam read the first reports of these speeches in the newspapers.\r\nVigilance and patience were the two qualities Gambetta most fervently\r\nenjoined on his compatriots. And vigilance for him involved two\r\nall-important reforms: the reorganisation of the army on the lines of\r\nuniversal military service, and compulsory education. _Chaque citoyen\r\nsoldat et instruit_ was his device.[268] Indeed, it is largely to the\r\nGreat Tribune that we owe that systematic teaching of patriotism in\r\nFrench schools which in the present war is bearing such rich fruit.\r\n“Every child in our elementary schools,” said Gambetta, “must be\r\ntaught that a cause exists to which it must give everything, sacrifice\r\neverything, its life, its future, its family, and that this cause is\r\nFrance.”\r\n\r\nThese words Mme. Adam and her husband read over and over again.\r\n“Yes,” exclaims Juliette, “we must sacrifice ourselves for France; we\r\nmust keep nothing back, and we must also serve him who utters these\r\npatriotic words,[269] and who has never despaired of his country.”\r\n\r\nWith Gambetta’s requirement that national education must be as\r\nsecular as the state itself the Adams were also in agreement. While\r\nevery religion should be assured of absolute liberty, Gambetta\r\ndeclared at Havre, “the state must not identify itself with any\r\ndogma or philosophy. If such questions are admitted to be within\r\nits competency, then it becomes at once arbitrary, persecuting,\r\nintolerant.”\r\n\r\nWith the importance Gambetta attached to the army the Adams were in\r\nperfect sympathy. All three they shared the President’s emotion when,\r\nat the close of the Longchamps review in the summer of 1871, _le petit\r\nbourgeois_, descending from his seat, grasped the hands of Marshal\r\nMacMahon as he marched past at the head of the army he had reformed,\r\nand in a voice choked by a sob murmured “Thank you.” “Gambetta,”\r\nwrote Juliette, “rejoices at the success of the review. He adores the\r\narmy.”[270]\r\n\r\nDuring their first talk with Gambetta after his return to political\r\nlife the Adams had advised their friend to found a republican\r\nnewspaper. “_Il vous faut un grand journal_,” said Adam.[271] “Would\r\nit not be possible,” asked Gambetta, “to revive _L’Avenir National_?”\r\nFounded in the middle sixties, largely financed by Adam, with his wife\r\nfor one of its regular contributors, and her friend Peyrat as editor,\r\nthe paper had at first been a brilliant success. Then it fell on evil\r\ndays, and in order to keep it going at all, Adam had to subscribe\r\nlarge sums. Having been hard hit by this earlier journalistic\r\nadventure, Adam did not feel himself in a position to provide funds\r\nfor a second. He suggested, however, that Gambetta might apply to\r\nother ardent republicans, to Dorian and to that fervent Alsatian,\r\nScheurer-Kestner, for example. While for collaborators, he could not\r\ndo better than appeal to Challemel-Lacour, Spuller, Ranc, Paul Bert,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this conversation was the foundation of _La République\r\nFrançaise_. “_Grandissime évènement_,” writes Mme. Adam, “_La\r\nRépublique Française a paru_.” Gambetta, assisted by Spuller, was\r\nits editor-in-chief, Challemel-Lacour its literary editor, Proust\r\nwas to contribute articles on foreign politics. The new paper’s\r\noffice was, of course, in the Rue Croissant.[272] Where else but in\r\nthat most famous journalist street in Paris could an influential\r\nnewspaper appear! And close at hand, only round the corner, in the\r\nBoulevard Poissonnière was the Adams’ flat. So, equally of course,\r\nwhen the editors’ work was done and they required some relaxation\r\nafter their literary labours, they were always welcome to talk and\r\ndominoes in the hospitable Maison Sallandrouze. “The workshops of the\r\n_République Française_ will be in the Rue Croissant, the Salon in\r\nthe Maison Sallandrouze,” writes Mme. Adam.[273] The paper’s success\r\njustified all the hopes inspired by the eminence of its editors and\r\ncontributors.\r\n\r\nIn every detail of its organisation Mme. Adam took a deep interest.\r\nAnd she was delighted when Spuller satisfied her curiosity by\r\ndescribing how the office was worked: how Challemel arrived at five\r\no’clock, looked through the dispatches and then summoned the various\r\neditors to discuss the day’s events; how barely had the conversation\r\nbegun when Challemel saw, in a flash, what would be the subject of his\r\nown article; how Isambert, the leader-writer, invariably came late;\r\nhow Paul Bert, who contributed articles on science, was punctuality\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n_La République Française_, as may well be imagined, figured large\r\nin the conversation when in the spring of 1874 its three directors,\r\nGambetta, Spuller and Challemel, visited Bruyères.\r\n\r\nGambetta stayed there a week, going over occasionally to visit his\r\nparents and sister, who were then living at Nice. Mme. Adam had made\r\ntheir acquaintance some time earlier. She found them excellent people\r\nof the shop-keeping class. Mme. Gambetta, a Frenchwoman of _la bonne\r\nbourgeoisie_, but with no dowry to speak of, had, as we have said,\r\nmarried a grocer of Genoese origin, who was then in business at\r\nCahors. But when Mme. Adam first made the family’s acquaintance they\r\nwere living at Nice. The household consisted of Gambetta’s father\r\nand mother, a widowed sister, Benedetta, her little boy Léon, and a\r\nservant, who, having entered the Gambettas’ service at thirteen, was\r\nregarded as one of the family. Gambetta’s aunt, the famous “Tata,” had\r\nfollowed her nephew to Paris. His mother, Mme. Adam could see at a\r\nglance, lived, moved and had her being in her celebrated son. She was\r\nproud to relate how before his birth she had consulted a soothsayer,\r\na somnambulist, who had declared her about to be the mother of a man\r\nwho would govern France. Gambetta’s relatives remained Mme. Adam’s\r\nlife-long friends. They frequently visited Bruyères. She helped them\r\nin various ways, and at Gambetta’s request arranged a second marriage\r\nfor his widowed sister, who became Mme. Léris; and when she is in the\r\nsouth of France Mme. Adam never fails to go and see her. Mme. Léris is\r\nnow living at Cahors, in what was formerly a monastic dwelling. She\r\nis surrounded by relics of her famous brother, trophies presented\r\nto him on great public occasions, which contrast strangely with the\r\necclesiastical fitments of the house.\r\n\r\nOne day in 1915, when I arrived at Gif, I found Mme. Adam reading a\r\nletter she had just received from Gambetta’s sister. This curious,\r\noriginal and highly entertaining document I was permitted to read.\r\nIt showed plainly that though all the family money had been spent on\r\nthe son’s education, by no means all the gifts had been showered upon\r\nhim, for a plentiful dower of wit, common sense and originality has\r\nevidently fallen to the lot of Mme. Benedetta.\r\n\r\nBut here we are anticipating. We must leave Mme. Léris and go back to\r\nthe year 1874, when her illustrious brother was visiting Bruyères.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam found Gambetta as delightful a guest as George Sand. She, by\r\nthe way, was one of his bitterest foes. She regarded him as nothing\r\nbut a windbag, _un simple utilisateur_.[274]\r\n\r\nGambetta’s voracious appetite, challenging comparison with that of\r\nthe hero of his favourite author, Rabelais, did full justice to the\r\ngood cheer which Mme. Adam never fails to put before her guests.\r\nHe ate well, he drank well, and he enjoyed, to the full, all the\r\npicnics and the excursions which were planned for his entertainment,\r\neven the sailings in the barque named after one of his arch-enemy’s\r\nmasterpieces, _La Petite Fadette_, and which ought, if there had been\r\nany consistency in the cosmos, to have foundered and shipwrecked one,\r\nat any rate, of its passengers.\r\n\r\nGambetta’s week at Bruyères afforded opportunities for many\r\nserious discussions. And although the friends were on the whole in\r\nperfect accord, we may, in the accounts Mme. Adam gives of these\r\nconversations, discern a difference of opinion, slight apparently,\r\nyet in reality fundamental, which, though at first a mere rift, was\r\nto widen into a chasm and finally to separate them. Mme. Adam even\r\nthen began to see that the Republic of Gambetta’s dreams was not\r\nso Athenian as she thought. Between her aristocratic ideas and his\r\nradicalism there was a pronounced difference. She wanted to see the\r\nmasses led by the _élite_. For Gambetta there was to be no _élite_:\r\nthe masses were to be educated to guide and govern themselves. “Then\r\nwe shall sink to their level,” prophesied Juliette. “No, we shall\r\nmerely stretch out our hands to them,” was Gambetta’s reply.[275]\r\n\r\nThat spring visit to Bruyères was repeated in the following winter\r\n(December, 1874) and many times afterwards. Gambetta would arrive\r\ntired, worn-out by his political battles and by his electoral\r\ncampaigns. But he, like Challemel-Lacour and many other exhausted\r\npoliticians, never failed to find Bruyères _La Villa du Bon Repos_.\r\nPerfect restfulness was the order of the day. Lunch was deferred\r\nuntil two, so that the tired guest might sleep till one. Even the\r\nhouse-dog, “Modeste,” was banished to the gardener’s cottage for fear\r\nhis barkings might disturb the great man’s slumbers. Everything was\r\ndevised to divert his mind from politics: plays, concerts and those\r\ncharades in which his hostess excels even to-day in her eighty-first\r\nyear. During excursions and picnics not a word so much as bearing on\r\npolitics was permitted to be spoken. Against the crowds of supporters,\r\nadmirers and curiosity-mongers who would have invaded his solitude his\r\nhost and hostess protected him with _une energie farouche_.[276] But\r\noccasionally not even their devotion could prevent his being compelled\r\nto make a speech in the neighbourhood, or on one occasion from the\r\nbalcony of Bruyères itself. Certain reactionary newspapers did not\r\nscruple to attribute a political significance to Gambetta’s visits\r\nto Bruyères. They hinted that Marshal MacMahon’s[277] government\r\nregarded with disapproval and had even made a raid on one of these\r\n_conciliabules_ in order to detect and denounce a civil servant who\r\nwas present.[278]\r\n\r\nIn the intervals of these visits, and while Mme. Adam was at Bruyères,\r\nGambetta, despite his multifarious occupations and interests, found\r\ntime to keep her _au courant_ with affairs in Paris by long letters.\r\n“He made his Sévigné,” as his friend expressed it, in a delightful\r\nmanner. At the length of his letters the Adams marvelled. In these\r\nlively pages he discussed in detail his own opinions and those of\r\nothers of the political situation at home and abroad. No one who is\r\ninterested in Gambetta should neglect to read this correspondence.\r\n\r\nThese letters show how serviceable was Mme. Adam to her friend and to\r\nhis party when conservative machinations were placing the Republic in\r\ngreat jeopardy. The year 1875 was a critical year for the Republic.\r\nThat constitution, which was to set it on a permanent basis, was\r\nthen being debated in the National Assembly. The President’s powers\r\nwere being defined, also his relations to the legislative body, now\r\nconsisting of a lower house, la chambre des députés, and an upper, the\r\nsenate, of which Adam became a member. The lively discussion of all\r\nthese matters, which took place in Mme. Adam’s salon, she reproduces\r\nin her _Souvenirs_. To the disappointment of republicans, it appeared\r\nthroughout the three following years that this constitution had not\r\nplaced the Republic out of danger. More than once the conservatives\r\nseemed on the point of substituting for it some kind of monarchical\r\n_régime_.\r\n\r\nThe Republic’s greatest danger was in the spring and summer of 1877,\r\nwhen MacMahon, by what is known as his _coup d’état_ of _le seize\r\nMai_, brought in a conservative ministry. At that time Mme. Adam was\r\npassing through the deep waters of personal bereavement. Edmond Adam\r\ndied in May. But before his death he had been able to render valuable\r\nservice to the republican cause by helping to unite the various\r\nsections of the republican party, _les vieilles barbes_ of 1848,\r\nthe moderates who supported Thiers and the extremists who were led\r\nby Gambetta. The Adams brought about a meeting between Gambetta and\r\nThiers. _Le fou furieux_ and _le vieillard sinistre_ found themselves\r\ncalled upon by the gravity of the political situation to sink their\r\ndifferences, and to unite their forces in opposition to MacMahon’s\r\nreactionary Government. This reconciliation practically assured the\r\ntriumph of the republican cause. Adam had also been able to sell very\r\nadvantageously a newspaper which Gambetta had recently founded, _La\r\nPetite République_. And the proceeds of this sale, so Gambetta himself\r\nadmitted, furnished him with the sinews of war for his political\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Adam’s funeral his friend the ex-President Thiers,\r\nwho himself had but three months to live, dragged his fourscore years\r\nup Mme. Adam’s staircase. “It was his wish and it is mine,” she said\r\nto her visitor, “that I should continue his life in my own.”\r\n\r\n“I will help you in every way I can,” said Thiers.[279] Then he went\r\non to impress upon her the importance of uniting their forces to win\r\nvictory for the cause to which Adam had devoted his life.\r\n\r\nThere lay upon the table, among the numerous letters of sympathy Mme.\r\nAdam had received, one from Émile de Girardin. In the days of Mme.\r\nd’Agoult’s salon they had been great friends; but they ceased to meet\r\nwhen Juliette married Adam. He, it will be remembered, could never\r\nforgive Girardin for having killed in a duel Armand Carrel, his friend\r\nand collaborator on the _National_. Now Girardin wrote: “Adam in his\r\nlife would not permit me to love him, will you permit it now he is\r\ndead?” “What am I to do?” Mme. Adam asked Thiers. “Let him come,” was\r\nThiers’ advice. “In your salon, Girardin will feel that he is absolved\r\nfrom the guilt of Carrel’s death.... Moreover, you owe it to Adam to\r\nfill that vacancy in our ranks which his loss has created.”\r\n\r\nMme. Adam acted on her friend’s advice: she received Girardin, who\r\nbecame henceforth a constant habitué of her salon, and one of the most\r\nvaluable assets of that Republican party from which hitherto he had\r\nheld aloof. “Girardin is detested and at times is detestable,” wrote\r\nMme. Adam, “but his friendship is the most faithful and courageous I\r\nhave ever known.”[280]\r\n\r\nMany another recruit did Mme. Adam’s charming persuasiveness enlist\r\non the side of the opposition. The republican leaders were constantly\r\nappealing to her to see what she could do with first one, then\r\nanother. One evening Gambetta said to her: “You have brought us\r\nGirardin; you have removed Raoul Duval from hostile influences; you\r\nare preserving for us the loyalty of many wavering friends; you are\r\nenrolling so many recruits, that now I ask you to do a very difficult\r\nthing—to attract Gallifet to our group.”[281] Needless to say,\r\nGallifet was won over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JULIETTE ADAM (JULIETTE LAMBERT), 1879]\r\n\r\nThroughout that critical summer Mme. Adam, despite her personal grief,\r\nfollowed in breathless expectation and with feverish interest every\r\ndevelopment of political affairs. The conservatives, dismayed by the\r\nlarge republican majority returned in 1876, persuaded MacMahon to\r\ndissolve the Chamber in the following June. They also brought pressure\r\nto bear upon the President so as to induce him to manipulate the\r\nnew elections. But all these reactionary efforts availed nothing. “We\r\nwent out 363, we shall return 400,” said Gambetta of the Republican\r\ndeputies, and though this prediction was not entirely fulfilled the\r\nRepublican majority remained a substantial one, only thirty-three\r\nseats were lost. On the night of the 14th of October, when the results\r\nof the election were coming in, Mme. Adam was at the office of _La\r\nRépublique Française_ in the _salon des tapisseries_.[282] Through\r\nthe open door she could hear Gambetta calling out the names of the\r\nelected. One of Gambetta’s secretaries, the brilliant Joseph Reinach,\r\nthen a youth of twenty-one, now and again came into the salon and\r\nconfirmed what she had overheard.\r\n\r\nTwo months earlier, at the urgent request of Thiers and Gambetta,\r\nshe had reopened her salon and resumed her Wednesday and Friday\r\ndinner-parties. Now for some days after this triumphant election she\r\nhad received her friends every evening. Gambetta had declared his\r\nreadiness to lead the 330 republican deputies into the very heart of\r\nthe citadel. Somehow or other the conservative ministers must be got\r\nrid of. They on their part were trying to persuade MacMahon to carry\r\nout another _coup d’état_. Gambetta and some of his friends were\r\nresolved in such an event to appeal to force. A discussion on this\r\nsubject took place in Mme. Adam’s salon.[283] There, one evening,\r\nGirardin announced: “Fortou is preparing his _coup d’état_.” Fortou\r\nwas Minister of the Interior in the _seize Mai_ Cabinet. “Voisin\r\n(Préfet de Police) has told me,” continued Girardin, “that at any\r\nmoment he may receive orders to arrest us all. He will not do so; he\r\nwill send in his resignation. But on the day of that resignation we\r\nmay all be arrested. And no doubt they will select one of Mme. Adam’s\r\nevenings for the raid.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied the Admiral Jauréguiberry, “we must prepare to\r\ndefend ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“With arms?” inquired Girardin.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course,” replied the Admiral briefly.\r\n\r\n“I was disappointed,” writes Mme. Adam, “to discover the timidity of\r\nsome who were present. I became furious and cried out: ‘After all, one\r\nrisks nothing worse than death in defending oneself.’\r\n\r\n“My two hands were seized by General Billot and shaken violently, with\r\nan exclamation of ‘Bravo, comrade!’ which made me very proud.”\r\n\r\nIt was an amplification of this scene, doubtless, which caused the\r\nappearance in one of the newspapers of an article entitled “Attack on\r\nLa Maison Sallandrouze.”\r\n\r\nHappily, however, the expected raid never took place, for civil strife\r\nwas averted. MacMahon, far from arresting Mme. Adam’s friends, called\r\non them to form a government. The Dufaure Cabinet came into office in\r\nDecember 1877.\r\n\r\nMost of the new ministers were habitués of Mme. Adam’s salon. The new\r\nMinister of Public Works, M. de Freycinet,[284] was Gambetta’s rival\r\nin her friendship. While for her Friday dinner-parties the Great\r\nTribune in consultation with his hostess chose such fellow-guests as\r\nwere likely to serve _ce pouvoir occulte_, which this statesman out of\r\noffice was beginning to exercise, the Wednesday dinners were known as\r\n“The Freycinet Evenings.”\r\n\r\nMme. Adam’s friendship with M. de Freycinet has endured to the present\r\nday. Already, in the middle seventies, “so bleached,” writes Sir\r\nSidney Colvin, “as to be known as _la souris blanche_,” he has lived\r\nto be a member of the War Cabinet of 1916.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam’s widowhood was still young when people began to speak of\r\nher re-marriage. “Several times over,” she writes, “rumour had married\r\nme to Gambetta.” Of another charming and wealthy Republican widow,\r\nMme. Arnaud de l’Ariège, the same report was circulated. “_Chacune\r\nson tour_,” said Mme. Adam, laughing, to her supposed rival. And Mme.\r\nArnaud replied: “Yes, but we know too well where Gambetta’s affections\r\nare fixed to believe any gossip about his marriage unless it should be\r\nto Mlle. L——”[285]\r\n\r\nFar from becoming more intimate, as we shall see in the next chapter,\r\nJuliette Adam and Gambetta were now beginning to disagree. These\r\ndifferences and other reasons made her think of leaving Paris before\r\nher accustomed time. “As I emerge from my mourning,” she writes,\r\n“more than one among my friends begins to regard me rather as a woman\r\nthan a widow.”[286] She was planning a new novel, _Grecque_; and in\r\norder to study a suitable background she resolved to visit Naples.\r\nHow strained her relations with Gambetta were becoming was proved by\r\ntheir farewell. “It would have been better for me had you started a\r\nfew weeks earlier,” said her friend. “Ah! if you had been able to play\r\nNapoléon, you would have been delighted to give me _un petit air de\r\nMme. de Staël_,” she retorted.[287]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[254] _Souvenirs_, IV. 286-7.\r\n\r\n[255] _Souvenirs_, V. 276.\r\n\r\n[256] p. 140.\r\n\r\n[257] _Souvenirs_, V. 163.\r\n\r\n[258] The extremists were led by Ranc, who was a much more sincere\r\nadmirer of the Great Tribune.\r\n\r\n[259] _Souvenirs_, V. 165.\r\n\r\n[260] _Souvenirs_, V. 166.\r\n\r\n[261] I am greatly indebted to Sir Sidney Colvin for having taken the\r\ntrouble to send me these reminiscences, and for permitting me to use\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[262] _Souvenirs_, V. 144-269.\r\n\r\n[263] _Ibid._, I. 169.\r\n\r\n[264] _Souvenirs_, V. 183.\r\n\r\n[265] _Souvenirs_, V. 185.\r\n\r\n[266] _Ibid._, 283.\r\n\r\n[267] _Ibid._, 383.\r\n\r\n[268] Gambetta’s speech at Havre.

When we examine man’s behaviour objectively\r\n     we find that revenge, however deathless a passion it is vowed\r\n     to be at emotional moments, is in actual life constantly having\r\n     to give way to more urgent and more recent needs and feelings.\r\n     Between nations there is no reason to suppose that it has any more\r\n     reality as a motive of policy, though it perhaps has slightly more\r\n     value as a consolatory pose.... In 1870 the former (France) was\r\n     humiliated with brutal completeness and every element of insult.\r\n     She talked of revenge, as she could scarcely fail to do, but she\r\n     soon showed that her grasp on reality was too firm to allow her\r\n     policy to be moved by that childish passion. Characteristically,\r\n     it was the victorious aggressor who believed in her longing for\r\n     revenge, and who at length attacked her again.”—Wilfred Trotter,\r\n     _Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War_, 199 (1916).\r\n\r\n\r\nMme. Adam’s attitude towards that policy known in France as _la\r\nRevanche_ offers an emphatic denial to one of Germany’s numerous\r\nmisrepresentations as to the origin of the Great War. In their peace\r\nconversations with America, as on many other occasions, the Germans\r\nhave declared that one of the chief causes of the present struggle was\r\nthe _Revancharde_ Policy of France. Nevertheless, for at least twenty\r\nyears before the war that policy, which had never been adopted by the\r\nFrench Government, had ceased to be advocated by the majority of the\r\nFrench nation. One of the countless proofs of this may be found in\r\nthe title Mme. Adam gives to the last volume of her Reminiscences,\r\n_Après l’Abandon de la Revanche_. About the year 1880 she began\r\nto find that those who advocated _la Revanche_ were a constantly\r\ndwindling minority. This minority continued to diminish until, in\r\nthe years immediately preceding the Great War, those whose national\r\nhopes were focussed on the reconquest of the lost provinces (for the\r\nword _revanche_ means not so much “revenge” in our sense of the word\r\nas a winning back of one’s own) came to number not more than one\r\nper cent. of the whole population. This was that infinitesimal group\r\nin whose Chauvinist activities and aspirations the German Empire\r\nprofessed to see a menace to the peace of Europe. And even among\r\nthose Chauvinist nationalists, of whom Mme. Adam was one of the most\r\nfervent, there was hardly one, certainly not Mme. Adam herself, who\r\nwould have ventured to advocate an immediate aggressive war for the\r\npurpose of reconquering Alsace-Lorraine. Not even the leader of French\r\nmilitarists, Boulanger, desired it. Nevertheless, it was true that\r\nMme. Adam and a few fellow idealists desired to see _la Revanche_\r\nbecoming once more what it had been during the first decade after\r\n1870, _l’idée reine_, the governing idea of France.\r\n\r\n_La Revanche_ in this academic sense was the banner of the _Ligue\r\ndes Patriotes_, presided over by Paul Déroulède, of the _Action\r\nFrançaise_, a Royalist society founded by Alphonse Daudet’s son Léon,\r\nin collaboration with that gifted writer Charles Maurras.\r\n\r\nBut none of these people were practical politicians; and none of them,\r\nas we cannot repeat too often, advocated an immediate aggressive\r\nwar for the reconquest of the lost provinces. They desired above\r\nall things that the brethren from whom they had been parted under\r\nsuch heartrending conditions should not feel themselves forgotten.\r\nAnd it was for the sake of these exiles that the _revanchards_\r\nprotested against Gambetta’s counsel, _pensons y toujours n’en parlons\r\njamais_. They spoke of them constantly, they spoke of them loudly—too\r\nconstantly, and too loudly, perhaps; for they certainly failed to\r\ninspire the majority of their compatriots with that consuming desire\r\nfor reunion which burnt in their own hearts.\r\n\r\nTo keep this idea alive, Mme. Adam has written and laboured for\r\nforty-five years. With this object, as we shall see, she founded a\r\nfortnightly magazine, _La Nouvelle Revue_. In an article in this\r\nreview, dated September 1881, replying to an accusation made by\r\nthe German Press that France was likely to appeal to force, Mme.\r\nAdam writes: “We have never ceased to ask M. Gambetta to remind our\r\nbrethren separated from us that we have never renounced the hope of\r\nreunion with them.” Then she adds diplomatically: “Nothing in this\r\naffirmation need alarm Germany’s military hegemony. Nevertheless, it\r\nis well for her to know that, though far from dreaming of a rash war,\r\nwe shall never be guilty of the crime of forgetting.”\r\n\r\nThe wave of patriotic and nationalist fervour, which, as the result\r\nof the Tangier (1905) and Agadir (1911) incidents, swept over France\r\nduring the ten years which preceded this war, indicated no desire for\r\naggression even on the part of the most rabid _revanchard_. It was\r\npurely for a defensive war that France was preparing when in 1913,\r\nin reply to Germany’s threatening military measures, she increased\r\nto three years the term of military service, which in 1905 had been\r\nreduced to two. By that time any idea of _la Revanche_ as a practical\r\nmeasure had vanished from the majority of French minds.[288] It was\r\nnot on her eastern frontier so much as in her vast colonial empire\r\nthat France now saw herself threatened by Germany.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam, still passionately clinging to the forlorn hope of _la\r\nRevanche_, had in her old age come to find herself practically alone\r\nexcept for a little group of literary idealists. Her adherence to this\r\nidea, which had been renounced by the majority of her nation, explains\r\nher political and religious evolution during the last thirty years.\r\n\r\nPrevious chapters of this book will have shown how completely\r\nin accord with Mme. Adam’s passionate, patriotic and energetic\r\ndisposition was this persistent advocacy of _la Revanche_. Retaliation\r\nwas in her blood. Even as a child, whenever she or any one else\r\nreceived an injury or suffered an injustice her first thought had been\r\nthat some one must be made to pay for it. She had never been able to\r\ntake any wrong lying down. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, was\r\nher motto; and nothing appeared to her so humiliating as the Christian\r\ndoctrine of resignation.\r\n\r\nAfter the war her desire for retaliation grew into a consuming\r\npassion. “I suffer acutely,”[289] she writes, “from that malady of\r\ndefeat, that perpetual pain which maddens a Frenchwoman who has been\r\nconquered at every turning of the roads of Alsace, of Lorraine, who\r\nhas been crushed at Sedan, deceived and surrendered at Paris.” That\r\nsuppressed combativity (_combativité rentrée_),[290] which on the\r\ncapitulation of Paris she felt well-nigh bursting her head and her\r\nheart, pursued her from February 1871 until August 1914.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam argued like Mr. Wells’ Letty when she believed her husband,\r\nTeddy, to be dead.[291] “You see, if he is dead, then Cruelty is the\r\nLaw, and some one must pay me for his death. Some one must pay me....\r\nI shall wait for six months after the war, dear, and then I shall go\r\noff to Germany.... And I will murder some German. Not just a common\r\nGerman, but a German who belongs to the guilty kind....”\r\n\r\nOn much the same lines did Mme. Adam reason when the iron of defeat\r\nentered into her soul—she, too, would exact payment, not for any\r\npersonal wrong, but for a national injury; she would murder some\r\nGerman, not only of the guilty but of the guiltiest kind, the\r\narch-criminal himself—none other than Bismarck. Only she would murder\r\nhim not with the sword, but with a weapon in the handling of which she\r\nwas more expert—with her pen. With this object, as we have said, she\r\nfounded, with the fortune her husband left her, _La Nouvelle Revue_.\r\nIn the pages of this magazine, in a series of powerful articles\r\nentitled, “Letters on Foreign Politics,” she pursued unceasingly the\r\nMan of Iron, revealing his hidden designs, disclosing his plots, and\r\nwarning France against the snares he was perpetually laying for her.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that so terrific a disaster as _l’Année Terrible_\r\nshould leave any serious-minded French person the same as before the\r\nwar. But it had not the same effect upon every one. While most of Mme.\r\nAdam’s circle embraced the policy of _la Revanche_, there were some\r\nwho, like George Sand and Arlès Dufour, turned their hatred not so\r\nmuch against Germany as against war as a whole, and who found their\r\ninternationalist principles strengthened by defeat. With such ideas\r\nMme. Adam had not a particle of sympathy. They sundered her from\r\nmany of her friends. They caused her to turn with more enthusiasm\r\nthan ever to the one man who seemed capable of realising her hopes,\r\nto Gambetta, _l’Homme de la Revanche_. Indeed, Gambetta’s immense\r\nenergy, his marvellous organising power, marked him as the one man in\r\nEurope capable of confronting and checkmating that _sauvage de génie_,\r\nBismarck.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have said, Mme. Adam’s hope in Gambetta as _l’Homme de la\r\nRevanche_ was doomed to disappointment. In order to see how her idol\r\ncame to be dethroned from his pedestal, we must retrace our steps,\r\nreturning to that critical year for the Republic, 1875.\r\n\r\nDuring the general election for the new Chamber, which took place\r\nafter the Republic had been definitely established by the constitution\r\nof 1875, Gambetta resumed his provincial tours. The political bagman\r\naddressed immense audiences at Aix, at Arles, at Lyons. “I am rapidly\r\nspending the reserves of rest which I laid in at Bruyères,” he writes\r\nto Mme. Adam on the 17th of January. A few days later he is in Paris,\r\nthen down in the south again at Marseilles, then up in the north\r\nat Lille, where he addresses four thousand persons. “_Enthousiasme\r\nindescriptible_,” he writes. “I made a speech with which I am much\r\nbetter contented than with my address at Aix. I explained to them what\r\nour next majority must be: republican, democratic, liberal, pacific.\r\nThose were the four heads of my sermon. I think I touched their hearts\r\nand converted many unbelievers, and some who were indifferent. The\r\ntown is decorated with flags. The streets are crowded, despite the\r\nsevere cold. I am delighted. I have ranged their ranks in something\r\nlike order. All our friends are reconciled; and I count on having\r\nfourteen deputies out of the eighteen.”[292] The republican majority\r\nof the new chamber was largely owing to Gambetta’s colossal efforts.\r\n\r\nThroughout the election the Adams had rendered their illustrious\r\nfriend invaluable service. Juliette, while she was at Bruyères, in\r\nletters which Gambetta described as _un vrai rapport de ministre\r\nplénipotentiaire_,[293] had kept him well informed of the state of\r\nparties in the south. Adam, a well-seasoned politician, had placed at\r\nhis disposal all the wealth of his varied political experience. He had\r\naccompanied him on his electoral tours, and once, on the occasion of\r\na great meeting at Auxerre, Juliette had joined the party. Whenever\r\nshe was at Paris, Gambetta could always count on meeting in her salon\r\npeople who would be useful to him.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the triumphs of _ce grand entraineur des masses_ Juliette\r\npersuaded herself brought nearer the longed-for day when her brethren\r\nwould be released from their chains and reunited to the motherland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEVICE OF THE CRUSADERS WHO ARE LED BY MADAME ADAM\r\nAND OTHER EMINENT FRENCHWOMEN]\r\n\r\nGambetta’s letters to Mme. Adam at this time show that he was firmly\r\nconvinced of Bismarck’s intention to renew war. Party strife in France\r\nhe believed was encouraging the Chancellor to become more and more\r\ninsolent. “_Le désarroi de la lutte anarchique de tous les partis\r\nen France_,” he writes,[294] “_permet au plus terrible adversaire\r\nde Berlin de nous presser de plus près en attendant qu’il fasse un\r\nsuprême effort pour arracher encore un lambeau de la patrie_.”\r\n\r\nGambetta was filled with despair to think that under such desperate\r\ncircumstances the French should have placed at their head _le plus\r\nimbécile des Français_. That at a moment when they needed a Richelieu,\r\na Villars, a Mazarin, a Danton, or at least a Talleyrand, they\r\nshould have unearthed the most insignificant of the Empire’s knights\r\n(_reîtres de l’empire_) and have confided to him the destinies of the\r\nnation. For Marshal MacMahon and his Government Gambetta has not a\r\ngood word to say. And that, but for the intervention of Russia and\r\nEngland, France in 1875 would have again been at war with Germany,\r\nthere now seems little doubt.\r\n\r\nIn a remarkable letter to Mme. Adam, written on the 24th of October,\r\n1874,[295] Gambetta, with a true statesman’s insight, puts his finger\r\non the danger spot of Europe, wherein forty years ago lay the embryo\r\nof this present conflict. “The powerful German Empire,” he writes,\r\n“is suffocating in Central Europe. With all its nervous energy it\r\nis striving to break through to the North Sea. It must have shores,\r\ncanals, straits, fleets, and a sea-going population. Its Baltic ports\r\nare too remote from the high seas. They are in constant danger of\r\nbeing choked up. The straits leading to them are narrow and dangerous.\r\nTo create a great fleet on those desolate and sandy shores is out of\r\nthe question. Bismarck realises that he cannot raise Germany to the\r\nrank of a first-rate Power without giving her a fleet as formidable as\r\nher army. This design is Holland’s death-sentence.”\r\n\r\nAnd Gambetta goes on to express his profound admiration of Holland,\r\nwhich he has just visited, and of the marvellous energy of the Dutch.\r\n\r\nWhen the crisis of 1875 was past, when the elections of 1876 had\r\nresulted in a Republican majority in the Chamber, although MacMahon\r\nstill remained President, Gambetta became more hopeful. At length\r\nthe Republic had been placed upon a definite footing. The four\r\nyears’ provisional government was now over. The constitution had\r\nbeen established. On the eve of the election, towards the end of the\r\ndebates on the constitution, Gambetta had written to Mme. Adam:[296]\r\n“At last we are nearing the end of our difficulties. And despite the\r\nmalcontents and the mere office-seekers, we (_i.e._ the republican\r\nparty) shall appear before the country in great force, offering it the\r\ntwo things we had promised—the dissolution of the Assembly[297] and\r\nthe Republic. Thus we shall place the country in a position to send us\r\na new political generation worthy to complete the work and capable of\r\nsuccessfully accomplishing the regeneration of _la patrie_.”\r\n\r\nThroughout the debates on the constitution, as we have seen, Mme.\r\nAdam’s salon continued to serve as a lobby to the chamber. Every new\r\nstage in the progress of that republican constitution she had so long\r\ndesired, filled her with rejoicing. “On the 24th of February,” she\r\nwrites,[298] “was passed the law establishing the Senate. Imagine\r\nour joy. Imagine the meetings in our salon.... Of course, as yet our\r\nRepublic is but in its infancy; but it will grow. And we are certain\r\nthat in a few days’ time the law defining the various parts of the\r\nconstitution will be passed. All our gratitude as old republicans is\r\ndue to Gambetta, who has conducted the negotiations with marvellous\r\ntact and diplomacy.”\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the success of his labours, Gambetta began to take a\r\nmore hopeful view of the European situation. The crisis of 1875 having\r\nbeen tided over, the French army having attained to a high degree of\r\nexcellent organisation, something approaching universal service for\r\nfive years having been instituted, he began to see his country in a\r\nposition to hold her own against Germany. Alas! how very far this\r\nwas from being the case was born in upon Gambetta when, in 1877,\r\nhe visited that country. On his return Gambetta sent Mme. Adam an\r\naccount of his journey. “This idea (the idea of the German visit),\r\n_chère amie_,” he wrote,[299] “originated with you in a friendly\r\nconversation.... We said to one another: ‛How useful it would be\r\n... to go to Germany, and to take the opportunity afforded by the\r\nmanœuvres of studying on the spot, and with one’s own eyes, the\r\nresults of that vast military organisation of which we have been the\r\nvictims, and of which we remain the objective.’\r\n\r\n“My only difficulty was how to carry out such an idea, how to observe\r\nclosely, how to penetrate everywhere without exciting attention and\r\nsuspicion, without being recognised.”\r\n\r\nThe simplest plan Gambetta found was to shave off his beard,\r\nthus rendering himself—as he puts it—uglier than ever, and quite\r\nunrecognisable even by his most intimate friends.\r\n\r\nThe result of that tour was to fill Gambetta with admiration of the\r\nwork accomplished by M. de Bismarck. But he was quick to see also that\r\nGermany’s prosperity depended on the Prussian sword. Once that was\r\nallowed to rust, then the whole mechanism of the German State would\r\nfall out of gear. “The men of this nation,” he writes, “were well\r\nadvised to concentrate their attention on the army. Their efforts have\r\nmet with the most complete success. Unhappily,” he continues, “we\r\npossess no force which is worthy to be compared with the troops I have\r\njust seen.”\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt of the profound effect produced upon Gambetta\r\nby this and other visits to Germany. They convinced him that France\r\nwas far from ready for _la Revanche_, at any rate for a _revanche_\r\nby force of arms. He did not, however, abandon altogether the hope\r\nof regaining the lost provinces by some diplomatic arrangement with\r\nBismarck. He could not believe that Germany would long be able to\r\nendure the enormous burden of such vast military expenditure. To\r\na deputation of Alsatians who visited him he held out this hope,\r\nadding,[300] “that the time would come when Germany would be willing\r\nto enter into some friendly agreement with France, and that for such\r\nan agreement there could only be one basis.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, until that happy day should dawn, Gambetta advocated the\r\nstrengthening of the French army. And henceforth, with renewed vigour,\r\nhe never ceased to urge on the Government the necessity of perfecting\r\nevery means of defence. No doubt it was partly due to this impulsion\r\ngiven by Gambetta that seven years after his death the German military\r\nattaché in Paris was compelled to admit to Prince von Hohenlohe that\r\nthe French army was superior to the German.[301]\r\n\r\nBut while France was improving and strengthening her defences,\r\nGambetta was inclined to seek elsewhere compensation for the lost\r\nprovinces. He advocated colonial expansion. He also advocated powerful\r\nalliances, notably with England; and with this object he more than\r\nonce met the Prince of Wales (afterwards Edward VII) in Paris.\r\n\r\nOn every one of these points, with the exception of the strengthening\r\nof the army, he found himself in disagreement with Mme. Adam. “If\r\nI did not regard the establishment of a Republic as an absolute\r\nguarantee of the reconquest of Alsace-Lorraine,” she had said to\r\nGambetta on the eve of the passing of the 1875 constitution, “then I\r\nwould not support the Republic.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you were a republican above all things.”\r\n\r\n“No. I am first a Frenchwoman, then a passionate adorer of liberty,\r\nthen a republican!”\r\n\r\n“And you are always out of rank,” added her friend, not without\r\nimpatience.[302]\r\n\r\nIt was during a picnic at Fontainebleau that Mme. Adam first heard\r\nGambetta advocate the return of France to her old colonial traditions.\r\nIt seemed to Juliette that by so doing he was postponing _la Revanche_.\r\n\r\n“For love of France,” she entreated, “do not think of these\r\ndiversions.”\r\n\r\nNeither would she hear of an alliance with England. The Picard\r\nblood ran too strong in her veins.[303] Not until our entrance into\r\nthis great war did she consistently display sympathy with great\r\nBritain.[304] Even during the Entente Cordiale she wondered whether\r\nEngland would not, after all, prove herself _perfide Albion_. Her\r\ngrandmother had taught her to mistrust the English, hate the Prussians\r\nand love the Russians. As a young girl she detested the idea of\r\nfighting the Crimean War in alliance with England; and when peace\r\ncame she rejoiced that now France could return to friendship with\r\nRussia and enmity with England.[305] So now, if France must seek for\r\nan ally, let her go to Russia, not to England. Bismarck was eager\r\nto avert any understanding between France and Russia. For that very\r\nreason, she said to Gambetta, we should seek it.[306]\r\n\r\nAs to Gambetta’s real opinion of a Franco-Russian alliance there\r\nis considerable uncertainty. André Tardieu in his book _Nos\r\nAlliances_[307] quotes Gambetta as having said to a French Ambassador,\r\nChaudordy, about to set out for Petrograd: _appuyés sur la Russie et\r\nsur l’Angleterre, nous serons inattaquables_. Mme. Adam tells of a\r\nmysterious journey she and her husband took with Gambetta to Geneva,\r\nwhere Princess Lise Troubetzkoi had arranged for him an interview with\r\nGortschakoff.[308] The interview did not take place, however. And it\r\nis perfectly clear from Gambetta’s correspondence with Mme. Adam that\r\nthen, for the time being, at any rate, he thought France should hold\r\nherself free from any alliances.\r\n\r\n“_La France_,” he wrote to Mme. Adam, “_doit se tenir à l’écart, elle\r\ndoit, tout en faisant des vœux pour la paix, ne rien faire, ne rien\r\ndire, qui puisse de près ou de loin l’engager même en parole avec\r\npersonne_.”\r\n\r\n“Europe,” he continued, “had stood by while France was conquered. Let\r\nEurope now arrange her own affairs. It was the turn of France to stand\r\naloof, to concern herself entirely with her own resurrection, to put\r\nher own house in order. When the day of her power and her strength\r\nreturned, then would be the time for her to make her voice heard, and,\r\nas the price of her support to say, ‛What will you give me?’ On that\r\nday,” wrote Gambetta, “we may receive attractive proposals from a\r\nquarter whence we least expect them.”\r\n\r\nWhat that quarter was Mme. Adam knew perfectly. Gambetta, it seemed\r\nto her, over-rated Bismarck’s power and influence. Her friend,\r\nshe thought, was inclined to reduce the whole of French policy to\r\nthe mere expectation of a day when from the Omnipotent, from the\r\nquarter “whence they were least expected,” France might receive\r\npropositions.[309]\r\n\r\nMme. Adam suspected Gambetta of being influenced in this direction\r\nby a certain salon which he had begun to frequent. With a few\r\nexceptions, those of Duclerc, de Reims and Gambetta, there were\r\nno people who, after Bismarck, were more bitterly hated in Mme.\r\nAdam’s circle than Count Henckel de Donnersmarck and his wife, the\r\nwidow of the Vicomte de Païva. Mme. Adam believed that la Païva, as\r\nshe called her, had been Bismarck’s spy before the war; and it was\r\nrumoured that her husband, the Vicomte, on discovering it, had hanged\r\nhimself. Count Donnersmarck was certainly on the best of terms with\r\nthe German Chancellor, who after the surrender of Metz had made him\r\nits Prefect. The holding of such an office was in itself enough to\r\nmake the Count detested in Paris. Nevertheless, finding Metz too hot\r\nfor him, with brazen effrontery he returned to the French capital and\r\nto the mansion in the Champs Elysées, which before the war he had\r\nbuilt on the site of the Jardin des Fleurs, and which has now been\r\nconverted into the Travellers’ Club. The rumour that he had advised\r\nBismarck to demand five milliards war indemnity instead of three did\r\nnot increase the cordiality of his reception. And one of Mme. Adam’s\r\nfriends, Xavier de Feuillant, so she tells us, horsewhipped him up the\r\nChamps Elysées.[310] Other Frenchmen, however, deemed it politic to\r\ncultivate the acquaintance of one who was in Bismarck’s confidence.\r\nAnd it was apparently in order to ascertain Germany’s real attitude\r\ntowards France that politicians like Thiers and journalists like Émile\r\nde Girardin accepted invitations to the magnificent dinner-parties at\r\nPaïva House.\r\n\r\nTo Mme. Adam such breaking of bread at an arch-enemy’s board was\r\nnothing short of the basest treachery. She wrote to her friend de\r\nReims, who had visited the Donnersmarcks,[311] that if he continued\r\nto frequent Bismarck’s agent she would break with him for ever and\r\ndeliver him up to Xavier Feuillant, who would treat him as he had done\r\nHenckel.\r\n\r\nImagine her horror, therefore, when Spuller told her that Gambetta,\r\nabove all people, had actually dined at la Païva’s table. Spuller\r\nswore her to secrecy. She could not, therefore, unburden her mind\r\nin those torrential reproaches to which she was now in the habit of\r\ntreating her former hero. But after Spuller had left her she gave way\r\nto despair. “I felt something die within me,” she writes.[312]\r\n\r\nYet another blow was in store for her; and again it was Spuller’s\r\nhand that was to inflict it. That Spuller who had been and was still\r\nthought to be Gambetta’s devoted friend, his right hand, his shadow,\r\nhis Achates, should thus have sowed discord between Mme. Adam and\r\nGambetta seems unaccountable until one considers that, while Spuller\r\nwas a fervent deist, Gambetta was constantly inclining more and\r\nmore to the extreme anti-clerical side, and to so-called atheists,\r\nrepresented by such politicians as Paul Bert. Further, after Edmond\r\nAdam’s death in 1877,[313] if rumours may be credited, both Spuller\r\nand Gambetta aspired to marry his widow.[314] Adam himself, in view of\r\nhis wife’s impulsive temperament, and well aware how numerous would\r\nbe the suitors who, after his death, would solicit her hand, on his\r\ndeath-bed exacted from her a promise not to remarry for three years.\r\nThe promise was unnecessary. Mme. Adam, who has always believed in a\r\nlife after death, feels that she and her husband have not been finally\r\nparted. _Nous continuerons à vivre notre vie tous les deux_,[315] were\r\nsome of the last words she spoke to him. And in that belief she has\r\ncontinued faithful to his memory for forty years.\r\n\r\nIt was after Adam’s death that Spuller committed what one cannot help\r\nregarding as a treacherous betrayal of Gambetta’s confidence. He made\r\na communication to Mme. Adam which for ever destroyed her belief in\r\nGambetta as _l’Homme de la Revanche_. On the 23rd of December, 1877,\r\nSpuller wrote from Paris to Mme. Adam at Bruyères[316] that Gambetta\r\nwas contemplating an interview with Bismarck at Varzin. Let us say\r\nat once that, as far as we know, the interview never took place. But\r\nthat Gambetta ever should have entertained the idea was enough for\r\nMme. Adam. Apparently the scheme had originated with Count Henckel and\r\nPrince von Hohenlohe,[317] then German Ambassador in Paris. They had\r\ncommunicated it to Thiers shortly before his death. He had passed it\r\non to Gambetta.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after she had received Spuller’s letter, Gambetta visited\r\nMme. Adam at Bruyères. He was on his way from a conference at Rome\r\nwith the Italian Prime Minister, Crispi, well known to be Bismarck’s\r\nfervent admirer and staunch supporter. Mme. Adam determined,\r\nwithout betraying Spuller’s confidence, to reproach her friend\r\nwith his _politique bismarckienne_. And in the last volume of her\r\n_Souvenirs_[318] she relates that memorable conversation in which she\r\ntook him to task not alone for his abandonment of _la Revanche_, but\r\nalso for his bitter anti-clerical policy.\r\n\r\nThey had been wandering along the shore till they found themselves on\r\nthe point which forms the extremity of the Baie des Anges. There they\r\nsat down on a rock. Against it, at their feet, the waves were beating\r\npersistently.\r\n\r\nHalf joking, half in earnest, Mme. Adam said to Gambetta, “That\r\nsighing wave for ever repulsed by the rock is I.”\r\n\r\n“And who is the rock?”\r\n\r\n“You and your perverse foreign policy.”\r\n\r\n“What policy?”\r\n\r\nTo avoid a direct reply, she asked a question: “And what was your\r\nobject in going to Rome if not to seal your Crispian and Bismarckian\r\npolicy?”\r\n\r\n“I was compelled to choose between two evils: that of national\r\neffacement, called isolation, and that of participation in the\r\ndiplomacy of Europe. I chose the latter, because it furnished me with\r\na support, the importance of which you cannot divine, in my domestic\r\npolicy.”\r\n\r\n“I do divine it,” she replied. “My Russian friends tell me things\r\nwhich enable me to draw my own conclusions. But, my dear friend, in\r\ncoming to terms with Bismarck (here Gambetta could not refrain from\r\na movement of surprise, which Mme. Adam feigned not to notice) you\r\nare involving yourself in a _Kulturkampf_ of which Bismarck himself\r\nis weary, for it disintegrates all parties. Your French _Kulturkampf_\r\nmay serve Italy and her feud with the papacy, and Victor Emmanuel must\r\nhave welcomed you as a friend. But it also benefits Paul Bert, Ranc,\r\nFerry, Brisson, Clemenceau. Now, although they may call themselves\r\nyour friends, they, the two last especially, have only one idea: viz.\r\nto remove you when you have removed all obstacles to the rise of these\r\ndemagogues.”\r\n\r\n“So you think me Bismarckian because I am anti-clerical.”\r\n\r\n“Certain of your restrictions, the change in your way of referring to\r\nour lost provinces, have tortured me. As soon as you refrained from\r\nsympathising with Russia at the beginning of the Russo-Turkish War, I\r\nconcluded that you had abandoned the idea of _la Revanche_; for the\r\nonly way to regain Alsace-Lorraine is by winning the hearts of nations\r\nwhose interests like our own render them the enemies of Germany and of\r\nEngland. This we may do by displaying our sympathy with those nations\r\nin their hours of trial.”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” remonstrated Gambetta, “you must know that it is\r\nmadness to think of reconquering Alsace-Lorraine.”\r\n\r\n“Now; yes, I know. But later? Duclerc, whose efficiency and devotion\r\nas president of the army commission you yourself have so often admired\r\nin my presence, constantly tells me we shall be ready in 1880.”\r\n\r\nGambetta shrugged his shoulders and replied impatiently—\r\n\r\n“We must experiment in a policy of expansion, we must conquer or by a\r\ntactful neutrality win the equivalent of that we have lost. Afterwards\r\nwe shall see. As for my anti-clericalism at home, so much the better\r\nif it furthers my policy abroad. But rest assured, it will not blind\r\nme so far as to risk the loss of the advantage to France of being\r\nregarded as the upholder of Catholic traditions.”\r\n\r\n“To carry out so double-faced a policy on a question which is so\r\nvital, surely that is impossible?”\r\n\r\nGambetta was convinced that it was possible. He went on to speak of\r\nItaly, of Victor Emmanuel, of his friendship for France, provided\r\nshe would undertake not to restore the Pope’s temporal power, of the\r\nbenefits of Italian unity. “Italy,” said Gambetta, “is now what France\r\nonce was, a perfect organisation.”\r\n\r\n“While with us,” replied Mme. Adam, “the loss of two of our organs is\r\nconstantly destroying our equilibrium more and more.... Never shall\r\nwe regain it until we have reconquered Alsace-Lorraine, as Italy has\r\nreconquered Lombardy and Venetia. Ah, my friend, how can I tell you my\r\ngrief at suspecting you more and more implicated with Germany? You,\r\nour national defender—you, whose words, whose acts galvanised in her\r\nhumiliation the France to whom you promised a resurrection, you are\r\nfalse to your mission! You must forgive me, but the cruel words must\r\nbe spoken: you betray your destiny. Never will Bismarck raise you to\r\nthat pinnacle of greatness on which you were placed by your fidelity\r\nto Alsace-Lorraine. But I wound you.”\r\n\r\nIt argues well for Gambetta’s magnanimity and also for his patriotism\r\nthat he could hear such reproaches and still remain the friend of her\r\nwho uttered them.\r\n\r\n“You cannot wound me, my dear friend,” he replied. “For you speak to\r\nme as you must speak—you, an idealist, whom reality does not restrain\r\nfrom arriving at contradictory conclusions.... You follow the dictates\r\nof your heart, I of my reason. We must each go our road.”\r\n\r\n“Mine,” she replied, “is the national road, marked out by the great\r\nproud past of my race; yours is a _combinazione_ with a scoundrel.”\r\n\r\n“Whatever our differences,” replied Gambetta, smiling, “let us promise\r\nto remain faithful to our friendship.”\r\n\r\n“I swear it,” she replied.\r\n\r\nIn taking that oath Mme. Adam was sincere. Despite their disagreement\r\non such vital matters, she valued highly Gambetta’s friendship.\r\nNevertheless, each pursuing so widely divergent a road, it was\r\ninevitable they should drift apart. The one great disagreement was\r\nmagnified by a thousand minor differences. She, who had first made\r\nhim _un homme du monde_, grew appalled to observe his increasing\r\npassion for luxury, for ostentation; his susceptibility to the\r\nflatteries of fashionable women who gathered round him; his neglect\r\nof the simple folk from whom he had sprung; his financial and amorous\r\nembarrassments.[319] Now that Adam was no longer at hand to extricate\r\nhim from the latter, she did what she could. But it was obvious to\r\nGambetta that he had forfeited her approval. Their meetings too often\r\npassed in mutual recrimination. Mme. Adam’s disappointment in her\r\nformer hero was accentuated by a series of events: first, when on\r\nMacMahon’s fall in 1877, Gambetta, instead of, as she hoped, becoming\r\nPresident of the Republic, accepted the office of President of the\r\nChamber; again, when in 1879, as President of the Council, he roused\r\nimmense opposition by the irony of appointing as Minister of Public\r\nWorship so pronounced an agnostic as Paul Bert; finally, when after\r\na few months in this highest political eminence to which he ever\r\nattained, he was defeated on a motion for electoral reform, and went\r\nout of office.\r\n\r\nBy that time Mme. Adam and Gambetta had ceased to correspond. They met\r\nbut seldom.\r\n\r\nOf the mystery which surrounds his death in the December of 1882 she\r\nrefuses to talk. “We never speak of those things,” she said sadly,\r\nwhen one day at Gif I referred to them. Equally silent is Mme. Adam\r\nabout that veiled figure dominating the background of Gambetta’s later\r\nyears, that Mlle. L. L——, who never missed one of Gambetta’s speeches\r\nin the Assembly, whose letters Gambetta used to read to Mme. Adam in\r\nthe early years of their friendship.[320]\r\n\r\nWith her innate cheerfulness she now prefers to dwell on the early\r\nyears of her friend’s career, when as an ardent young Bohemian\r\nmeridional he was first making his appearance in her salon, or when\r\nat the height of his fame he kept his state at her evening parties,\r\nremaining in an ante-room apart and there receiving in solemn conclave\r\nthose whom, as likely to help him in his political designs, his hosts\r\nthought it desirable he should meet. In those days he was still living\r\nwith his old Aunt Tata in Paris, and in affectionate intimacy with\r\nhis parents and sister in the south. His sister’s sons are to-day\r\nas dear to Mme. Adam as if they were her own. Of one of them, Léon,\r\nthe younger, who is now a cavalry officer at the front, she relates\r\nwith pride that he has sworn to be the first to ride into reconquered\r\nStrasbourg.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[288] See Marcel Sembat, _Faites un Roi ou faites le Paix_ (1915),\r\n_passim_.\r\n\r\n[289] _Souvenirs_, V. 2.\r\n\r\n[290] _Ibid._, IV. 316.\r\n\r\n[291] _Mr. Britling Sees it Through_, 378.\r\n\r\n[292] _Souvenirs_, VI. 330.\r\n\r\n[293] _Ibid._, 198.\r\n\r\n[294] _Souvenirs_, VI. 157.\r\n\r\n[295] _Ibid._, 182.\r\n\r\n[296] _Souvenirs_, VI. 290.\r\n\r\n[297] It had been sitting since February 1871.\r\n\r\n[298] _Souvenirs_, VI. 226.\r\n\r\n[299] _Ibid._, 388.\r\n\r\n[300] Henri Galli, _Gambetta et l’Alsace-Lorraine_, p. 315.\r\n\r\n[301] Prince von Hohenlohe, _Mémoires_, II. 405.\r\n\r\n[302] _Souvenirs_, VI. 16.\r\n\r\n[303] _Ibid._, I. 208.\r\n\r\n[304] Her references to England in her articles contributed to\r\n_La Nouvelle Revue_ are somewhat contradictory.

Adam.\r\n\r\n     “_L’âme de la France est-elle donc catholique, et ne peut-on être\r\n     en contact absolu avec elle que par le catholicisme et sa plus\r\n     pure tradition?_”—Ibid.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Something is dying within me” (_quelque chose agonise en moi_) Mme.\r\nAdam had written at the close of her most memorable talk with Gambetta\r\nin 1878. That something was not only her faith in her friend’s\r\ndetermination to achieve _la Revanche_, it was also her hope for the\r\nestablishment of an ideal Republic. To her mind the Republic, for the\r\nsake of whose stability Gambetta had found it necessary to sacrifice\r\n_la Revanche_ and to enter into an understanding with Bismarck, was\r\nnot worth having.\r\n\r\n“One does not make use of a Bismarck,”[321] Mme. Adam had said to her\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” was his rejoinder. “Perhaps it will be he who will give\r\nus the Republic.”\r\n\r\n“Then it would be fatal to us,” she replied. And that this Republic\r\nwas proving fatal to liberty and fatal to her hopes she was becoming\r\nmore and more fully convinced. “It is disenchanting us all, alarming\r\nus all,” she wrote. “It is disappointing our dreams of greatness at\r\nhome and showing itself incapable of any effort towards heroism and\r\ngreatness abroad.”[322]\r\n\r\nFrom the time of her rupture with Gambetta until the Great War, Mme.\r\nAdam was indeed what one of her contemporaries has most happily called\r\nher, _la grande désabusée de la troisième république_.[323]\r\n\r\nAlmost as strongly as of his abandonment of _la Revanche_ did Mme.\r\nAdam disapprove of Gambetta’s virulent anti-clerical policy. She began\r\nto agree with Mérimée, who, though an agnostic, feared lest so-called\r\nfree-thinkers might prove as intolerant as the Church. “Do you\r\nthink,” he had said, referring to the anti-clericals of those imperial\r\ndays,[324] “that these men, if they were in the Government would ever\r\ngive you liberty? They are the sons of Robespierre, Saint-Just and\r\nMarat. If ever they come into power, they will follow the example not\r\nmerely of the Terrorists but of the Church in its darkest days. For\r\nthey themselves, the fanatics of anti-clericalism, they are a church,\r\nsmaller than the other but equally dogmatic.”\r\n\r\nIn his first speeches after the war Gambetta had declared himself\r\nin favour of strict liberty of opinion. But, finding the Republic’s\r\nenemies too often in close alliance with the Church, he had become\r\nembittered against the Catholic party.\r\n\r\nThirty years later Combes’ bitter attack on the Church was to\r\narouse in many a free-thinker Catholic sympathies. In like manner\r\nGambetta’s extreme anti-clericalism helped to make a Catholic of Mme.\r\nAdam. Towards the end of his life he tended more and more to throw\r\nin his lot with the extreme anti-clericals led by Paul Bert, who,\r\nadapting to the moment Peyrat’s famous phrase, _le cléricalisme c’est\r\nl’ennemi_,[325] declared _le cléricalisme c’est le phylloxera_.\r\n\r\nThat wily deist Spuller did not neglect this further opportunity\r\nof stealing a march on his rival.[326] He encouraged Mme. Adam in\r\nthe idea that by waging war against the Church Gambetta was playing\r\nBismarck’s game, and helping the Chancellor to carry on in France the\r\n_Kulturkampf_ he was conducting with so much vigour in Germany. Had\r\nnot Gambetta himself admitted that the _Kulturkampf_ had changed the\r\nwhole aspect of the struggle against the Church![327] In France, he\r\nhad come to regard the separation between the Church and State as an\r\nalmost necessary condition of any durable alliance with the Italian\r\nkingdom. “As long as we remain the eldest daughter of the Church,” he\r\nsaid to Mme. Adam,[328] “the papacy will rely upon our support, and\r\nthis will inevitably endanger our friendly relations with Italy.”\r\n\r\nGambetta’s attitude in these vital matters was certainly changing\r\nhis friend’s religious point of view. She was beginning to feel that\r\nshe could no longer, as in 1866, describe herself as a pagan and an\r\nanti-clerical.[329] Then to oppose the Church had been to oppose the\r\nEmpire. Now it seemed to her that to oppose the Church was to unite\r\nwith Bismarck. The Catholic traditions of her country were beginning\r\nto appeal to her. “I remembered,” she writes,[330] “how for centuries\r\nCatholic France had been superbly patriotic, how for centuries the\r\nassociation between God and the King, God and _la patrie_, had perhaps\r\nbeen more essential than I had ever believed.”\r\n\r\nAlready she had travelled far from the days of the siege of Paris,\r\nwhen, in admiration of the nuns’ fearlessness during the small-pox\r\nepidemic, she had reflected, “Ought not my philosophy to give me as\r\nmuch courage as they derive from their religion?”[331]\r\n\r\nBy a strange contradiction Mme. Adam’s passion for revenge was\r\ncarrying her towards a religion whose Founder had refused to\r\ncountenance such a sentiment. But in wending her way Romewards she\r\nwas obeying not so much the dictates of reason as ancestral voices,\r\nimpulses arising from her subconscious self, beckonings from that\r\nCatholic past which is never far removed from any child of France.\r\n\r\nThe years 1876 and ’77 were dark years for Juliette Adam. They had\r\nreft from her George Sand, her father, Dr. Lambert, and then her\r\nhusband. Dr. Lambert had died early in 1876, while his daughter was\r\nat Bruyères. Mme. Sand’s death occurred on the 8th of June. In the\r\nAugust of the following year, it fell to Mme. Adam’s lot to perform\r\na melancholy mission. George Sand, shortly before her death, had\r\nexpressed a wish that her study should remain under lock and key for\r\none year, at the end of which it should be opened by her son Maurice\r\nand Juliette Adam. For this purpose Mme. Adam went to Nohant, where\r\nshe found awaiting her a strange and sorrowful experience. When the\r\nseal was broken, there was the study just as George Sand had left it,\r\nwith a partly finished manuscript on the desk, with the arm-chair half\r\nturned round as when its occupant had risen from it for the last time.\r\nDuring those moments the spirit of the departed seemed to come very\r\nnear to her friend.\r\n\r\nBy that time Mme. Adam was a widow. Her husband had died in the\r\nprevious May. Throughout her bereavement, there was no one to whom she\r\nturned more willingly for consolation than to Adam’s friend Thiers. He\r\nnever tired of hearing her talk about her husband, whom he had known\r\nlong and intimately, and whom he had never failed to appreciate. But\r\nthree months after Adam’s death, Thiers followed him to the grave.\r\n\r\n“Blow after blow falls upon me,” writes Mme. Adam. “Thiers’ loss\r\ncreates another blank in my life.”\r\n\r\nHer buoyant cheerfulness, however, her unquenchable hopefulness, her\r\ninnate optimism would not permit her to remain long a prey to grief\r\nand melancholy. If earthly things disappointed her, if she failed to\r\nfind here below the fulfilment of her hopes, the realisation of her\r\ndreams, then she would look elsewhere. She refused to be altogether\r\ndisappointed. With Jean Jacques Rousseau she felt that she had wept\r\ntoo much in this life not to believe in another. Henceforth she began\r\nto dwell more and more on that other world, of faith in which her\r\npaganism had never succeeded in depriving her. With her the unseen had\r\never been vividly present.\r\n\r\nHer exuberant Celtic imagination had projected itself into the spirit\r\nworld. She believes that her grandmother appeared to her after her\r\ndeath, and that many important events of her life have been prophesied\r\nto her by some soothsayer, palmist or somnambulist. She herself used\r\nto tell fortunes; and, at the close of her evening receptions, to\r\na few favoured guests, Gambetta, Girardin, Spuller, for example,\r\nwho liked to linger after the rest had gone, she would predict the\r\nfuture by cutting cards. But her own soothsaying must not be taken\r\ntoo seriously. For she admits she was glad to take this opportunity\r\nof telling some home truths, and giving to her friends useful advice\r\nwhich, administered in any other way, might have offended them.\r\nGambetta was frequently the recipient of such counsel. The cards,\r\nfor instance, warned him that by a meeting as “diabolical as that\r\nof Christ’s temptation on the mountain” he was risking the loss of\r\nhis prestige.[332] He was also enjoined to beware of women and their\r\nadvice. Some would dash him into the abyss of ruin, he was told,\r\nwhile others would raise him on to dizzy heights no less dangerous.\r\nHe was bidden to be a lover and a friend, but to choose only men\r\nfor his confidants. Refusing to recognise in such warnings anything\r\nbut the advice of the fair necromancer herself, Gambetta replied\r\nmischievously, “You are rather hard on yourself. But perhaps it is in\r\norder that you may be still harder on others.”\r\n\r\nIn the past, the main object of Mme. Adam’s adoration had been _la\r\npatrie_. So it will continue to be until the end. In her pagan days,\r\nafter _la patrie_, she had adored the gods and heroes of Greece and\r\nRome. They had represented to her the ideals of a civilisation which\r\nshe regarded as the highest and most complete to which humanity has\r\nyet attained. When Mme. Adam became a Christian the gods and heroes\r\nof antiquity made way for Christ and His Saints, and for Mme. Adam’s\r\npatriotic soul first among the latter is Jeanne d’Arc.[333] For even\r\nnow _la patrie_ remains enthroned in the first place in her hierarchy.\r\nIndeed, she has returned to the Catholic Church chiefly because thus\r\nshe hopes best to fulfil her mission as a patriotic Frenchwoman. “I\r\nbelieve,” she said to me, “that a true French patriot can no more\r\nescape being a Catholic than can a truly patriotic Turk escape being a\r\nMussulman.” Nevertheless, that it may not always be easy to reconcile\r\npatriotism and religion is suggested by the following letter, which\r\nMme. Adam wrote in reply to my inquiry as to her views of the reputed\r\npro-German attitude of the present Pope—\r\n\r\n                                                “_Abbaye de Gif_,\r\n                                                    “14.ii.16.\r\n\r\n     “.... _Pour le Pape—Je suis catholique, apostolique et romaine.\r\n     Revenue aux croyances de ma grand’mère.... Vous comprendrez que je\r\n     n’ai pas, si tardive croyante, le droit de discuter les actions\r\n     du St. Père. Mais mes vœux étaient pour le Cardinal Rampolla, que\r\n     l’Autriche détestait et que la France eut tant aimé! Là encore je\r\n     dois me taire. Vous pouvez seulement dire à quel point mes vœux\r\n     accompagnaient le Cardinal Rampolla, que j’avais la fierté de\r\n     connaître._”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (1885)]\r\n\r\nWe have seen how Mme. Adam’s father had brought her up in communion\r\nwith the Hellenic soul; how in Mme. d’Agoult’s salon she delighted\r\nto fraternise with those enthusiastic Hellenists, de Ronchaud,\r\nPaul Saint-Victor, and Louis Ménard. After her rupture with Mme.\r\nd’Agoult, and throughout all the vicissitudes of the intervening\r\nyears, this _Grecque ressuscitée_, as Victor Hugo used to call her,\r\nhad never ceased, whenever she met her Hellenic friends, with them\r\nto live and move and have her being in the world of ancient Greece.\r\nTogether they dreamed of seeing established in France what they\r\ndescribed somewhat vaguely as “the Athenian Republic.” Together\r\nthey welcomed the advent of those young poets, “the incomparable\r\nParnassians,” whom Ménard fathered, François Coppée, Sully\r\nPrudhomme,[334] Hérédia, Alphonse Daudet, Baudelaire, Villiers de\r\nl’Isle Adam, Anatole France and Lecomte de Lisle. Mme. Adam had been\r\ndelighted when Gaston Paris brought to her salon that wonderful Sully\r\nPrudhomme, who from a workman in Creusot’s factory had developed\r\ninto a poet, scholar and philosopher.[335] Volume by volume, as they\r\nappeared, she devoured Lemerre’s edition of the Parnassians’ collected\r\nworks, becoming every day, she writes, _sauf quelques réserves_, a\r\nconvinced admirer and an ardent propagandist of the new school of\r\npoets.[336]\r\n\r\nThe reserve she referred to was this: she could not bring herself to\r\nadmire the marmoreal immobility cultivated by the Parnassians. “_Ils\r\nne rêvent pas comme moi_” she writes,[337] “_de draperies flottantes\r\nau vent qui souffle du golfe de Phalère ou du mont Hymette: ils\r\nveulent le pli statuaire, moi je l’aime vivant_.”\r\n\r\nOne, who attended Mme. Adam’s reception when her salon was at the\r\nheight of its political influence, tells how eager she was to withdraw\r\nfrom political discussion whenever an opportunity offered of talking\r\nabout Greece and things Greek.\r\n\r\nHer three best novels, _Laide_, _Grecque_ and _Païenne_, are inspired\r\nthroughout by these Hellenic sympathies. In a delightful article on\r\n_Le Néo-Hellenisme_,[338] Jules Lemaître, that most eminent of French\r\ncritics since Sainte-Beuve, bestows high praise on this trilogy\r\nof novels, which he describes as “a rare effort of sympathetic\r\nimagination.” Nevertheless, though in all sincerity Mme. Adam strove\r\nhard to attain to the Greek point of view, a mind so essentially\r\nactual as hers could not fail to introduce a certain modernity\r\ninto her portrayal of what seemed to her the Greek atmosphere and\r\ntemperament. As Lemaître points out, in these novels every passion,\r\nevery impression, every phrase, is obviously three thousand years\r\nolder than a line of Homer, twenty-four centuries older than a line of\r\nSophocles.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam, with her antipathy to everything Gothic, Teutonic and\r\nmediæval, may try to cultivate a dislike of romanticism, she remains\r\nnotwithstanding, and her criticism of the Parnassians quoted above\r\nproves it, a romanticist, the child of Chateaubriand and Mme. de\r\nStaël. She may try to ignore the Middle Ages, but she cannot suppress\r\nthem. And Jules Lemaître may well inquire whether “if the whole Middle\r\nAges had not groaned and bled beneath the Cross Mme. Juliette Lamber\r\nwould be able to rejoice so rapturously in her Greek gods.” For the\r\nvague paganism of that day depends for its very existence on the\r\nChristianity of which it was the negation. The paganism of Mme. Adam\r\nand her friends was provoked by the Christian’s enmity to all things\r\ncarnal. It was a protest in favour of that _joie de vivre_, of that\r\nphysical beauty, of those natural joys which the mediæval Christian\r\nhad condemned as the works of the devil. When life’s joyfulness began\r\nto fade, Mme. Adam, like so many others, turned to Christianity.\r\nShe had always, as she had confessed to Littré at Mme. d’Agoult’s\r\ndinner-party,[339] had the will to believe.\r\n\r\n“Would you know how and why I became a Catholic, then you must read\r\n_Chrétienne_,” said Mme. Adam. And indeed this novel describes her\r\nconversion from paganism to Christianity. Here we see how that\r\nadoration of Greece, which she owed to her father’s upbringing had\r\nceased to be a living inspiration, how it had been relegated to\r\nthe past. That old conflict of her childhood between her father’s\r\npaganism and her grandmother’s Christianity recurring, resulted in her\r\ngrandmother’s influence gradually alienating her soul from Greece, and\r\ntransforming into a mere literary preference what was once a religious\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\n_Chrétienne_ is the sequel to _Païenne_. The two novels tell the\r\nstory of a beautiful Frenchwoman, Melissandre. She is married to a\r\nheartless rake, whom she has never loved, a M. de Noves. She has a\r\nlover, a gifted painter, Tiburce. Both novels are in the form of\r\nletters. They contain few incidents. But they tell the story of a\r\nconsuming passion, which in _Païenne_ burns with fierce ardour and\r\nin _Chrétienne_ cools down into serene affection. The death of the\r\nhusband, M. de Noves, which occurs in a duel at the close of _Païenne_\r\ndoes not, as one might expect, lead to the lovers’ immediate marriage.\r\nBefore the consummation of their legal union intervenes the whole\r\nof _Chrétienne_. For religious misgivings, which have arisen in the\r\nheart of Melissandre, cause her to banish her lover for a while. He\r\ngoes to Greece. She remains in France. In the interval, Melissandre\r\nand Tiburce, who had both been fervent pagans, fall under Catholic\r\ninfluences, which convince them that their Hellenic ideals are only to\r\nbe cherished so far as they lead to Christ. In the words of Tiburce,\r\nthey follow “the great pagan” St. Paul on the road to Damascus.[340]\r\nAnd not until they have been received back into the Church of their\r\nfathers do they become man and wife.\r\n\r\nIn these two books Mme. Adam brilliantly displays one of her most\r\neminent literary gifts, which she has shown in all her writings: her\r\npassion for the beauties of nature and her power of describing them.\r\nIt was their love of nature that had first attracted her to the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe idea of race has ever played a dominant part in Mme. Adam’s\r\nmentality. “_Je suis Gauloise, je suis Grecque, Latine, mais rien\r\nd’autre_,” she writes.[341] In returning to Christianity she flattered\r\nherself that she was returning to the traditions of her race, to the\r\nRoman Church which she regards as the highest expression of Latin\r\nculture, and of that Mediterranean tradition, which embodies all\r\nthat she loves and respects, and which is the direct antithesis to\r\nthe northern tradition, to the _Kultur_ of Berlin.[342] Bismarck she\r\nhated, not only as the conqueror of France and the persecutor of\r\nCatholics, but as the sworn foe of Latin culture. Spuller had told\r\nher that the Chancellor had a horror of everything Latin, that in his\r\n_Kulturkampf_ he was warring not merely against the religious idea,\r\nbut against Latin influence in letters, philosophy and art.[343]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[321] _Souvenirs_, VI. 30.\r\n\r\n[322] _Ibid._, VII. 356.\r\n\r\n[323] Arthur Meyer, editor of _Le Gaulois, Ce que mes yeux ont vu_,\r\n158-9.\r\n\r\n[324] _Souvenirs_, III. 15.\r\n\r\n[325] _Ibid._, VI. 128.\r\n\r\n[326] _Ibid._, VII. 48.\r\n\r\n[327] _Ibid._, 124.\r\n\r\n[328] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[329] _Souvenirs_, III. 86.\r\n\r\n[330] _Ibid._, VII. 380.\r\n\r\n[331] _Ibid._, IV. 119.\r\n\r\n[332] _Souvenirs_, VII. 164.\r\n\r\n[333] Technically, Jeanne d’Arc is not a saint.

Adam’s nature. It characterises\r\nalike her hatred and her loves, her preferences and her prejudices.\r\nWhile, as Gambetta remarked, she lets her rancour run dangerously near\r\nferocity,[344] she treasures her friendships as the most precious\r\ngifts of the gods. Nothing pleases her better than to help her\r\nfriends. “The surest way to my friendship,” she declares, “is to ask\r\nme to render some service.”\r\n\r\nSitting next to Edmond de Goncourt at one of Alphonse Daudet’s\r\ndinner-parties, she said, “I have a hundred friends ... and that is\r\nabout the number I need.... I am always grateful to people who make\r\ndemands on me. It is my life.... My energy loves to be serviceable.”\r\nShe has ever been ready to wear herself out in the cause of the\r\nunfortunate, _pour s’intéresser aux pauvres diables_, as her friend\r\nLéon Daudet expresses it. I find in one of her letters to me this\r\nsentence: “_Chacune de vos lettres m’attache maternellement à vous;\r\nc’est ainsi que j’aime le plus_.” In another letter she expresses this\r\nvery characteristic sentiment: “_C’est tout de suite ou jamais avec\r\nmoi. Vous avez senti qu’avec vous c’était tout de suite._” At a glance\r\nshe has always decided whether she likes or dislikes a person. If the\r\nformer, then she gives her confidence absolutely and completely. But\r\nwoe to the unhappy wight whom she finds in any fundamental matter\r\nunworthy of that confidence. “I don’t envy any one who is Mme. Adam’s\r\nenemy,” said Changarnier. “But,” replied Jules de Lasteyrie, “I do\r\nenvy any one who is her friend.”\r\n\r\nIn everything which concerns the welfare of her friends Mme. Adam\r\ntakes the deepest interest. I shall never forget her solicitude for\r\nmy safety in my numerous war-time Channel crossings. Immediately the\r\n_Sussex_ went down, she wrote asking if I knew any one who was on\r\nboard. As the submarine menace grew more serious, whenever I returned\r\nto England she would bombard me with letters and postcards clamouring\r\nto be assured of my safety: “_Chère amie, ecrivez-moi vite que vous\r\nêtes bien arrivée_”; then another card: “_Chère, très chère amie, je\r\nvous supplie de m’envoyez ce simple mot sur une carte ‛arrivée.’_”\r\nFinally, after the torpedoing of a French man-of-war and the loss\r\nof the crew of six hundred, she writes: “_Il ne faut plus venir en\r\nFrance sans une nécessité absolue, car je crois que les affreux Boches\r\najouteront des crimes à leurs crimes_.” In another letter she had\r\nwritten: “_Le dieu teuton demande des crimes journaliers_.”\r\n\r\nSome of the most entrancing pages of Mme. Adam’s _Souvenirs_ tell\r\nthe story of her literary friendships with Victor Hugo, Gustave\r\nFlaubert, Alphonse Daudet. It was in friendship that she found her\r\ngreatest consolation at the time of Adam’s death. Gambetta was with\r\nher when the doctor gave up all hope of his recovery. “I shall return\r\nthis evening,” said her friend, “and many of us will come.” Her\r\nhusband during his last days liked to know that she was receiving as\r\nusual.[345]\r\n\r\nAs the breach between Mme. Adam and Gambetta widened, her salon\r\nunderwent a change. Its mistress, disappointed with politics, turned\r\nmore and more to her artistic and literary friends. “If in politics\r\nthere is much to sadden me,” she wrote,[346] “I have my literary\r\nconsolations.” Coquelin was now to be found frequently at her\r\nreceptions, so were the Alsatian painter, Henner, the battle-painter,\r\nDetaille, and Carolus Duran.\r\n\r\n“My salon is quite changed,” she writes, “but it is no less lively\r\nthan of yore. Conversation has gained in brilliance what it has lost\r\nin weight.”[347] Artists, authors, sculptors, musical composers were\r\ndelighted to meet one another; and the politicians who still visited\r\nher were pleased to _se dépolitiquer_.\r\n\r\nIn this transformed salon there gradually materialised an idea which\r\nMme. Adam had long cherished.\r\n\r\nEven before the war it had more than once been suggested to the\r\nAdams that they should found a review. George Sand, while she was\r\nvisiting Bruyères, had tried to induce her host and hostess to start\r\na fortnightly magazine which might rival _La Revue des Deux Mondes_,\r\nfrom the tyranny of whose editor, Buloz, she was suffering much.\r\n“Adam,” she argued,[348] “has been a journalist, you are literary.\r\nHe with his critical gift and sound common sense would be an ideal\r\neditor, you with your zeal and your passion for admiring would\r\ndiscover new talent; you would revel, as I have always done, in the\r\njoy of bringing others into notice.”\r\n\r\nBut Adam was too much of a politician to entertain the idea of\r\ninaugurating a publication which should have a strong literary as well\r\nas political strain. After Adam’s death, however, George Sand’s words\r\noften recurred to his widow.\r\n\r\nShe first communicated her idea to Flaubert. That consummate master\r\nof literary style had never made much money by his books. Mme. Adam,\r\nwho had been his friend for years, was seriously distressed by his\r\nfinancial embarrassments, which he had vainly tried to conceal from\r\nher. His pride rendered him one of the most difficult people to help.\r\nBut Mme. Adam, with his friends Taine, Tourguénieff, and others,\r\nsucceeded in persuading Jules Ferry, then President of the Chamber, to\r\nappoint Flaubert librarian of the Arsenal Library. It was when he came\r\nto thank Mme. Adam for her kindness in this matter that she broached\r\nto him the subject of a magazine, in which he should be “the master of\r\nmasters,” if he would agree to contribute one article a month.[349]\r\n\r\n“What!” he exclaimed in horror; “like that—by the yard, so much a\r\nline!”\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied, “so much the word, the letter! For anything by\r\nFlaubert is gold, it is rubies.”\r\n\r\n“That is enough,” he interrupted. “When I have completed my revision\r\nof _L’Education Sentimentale_, of which I am publishing a new edition,\r\nI will finish _Bouvard et Pecuchet_, and you shall have that.”\r\n\r\n“You will swear it?”\r\n\r\n“I swear it.”\r\n\r\nFlaubert was greatly taken with the idea of the new venture. He\r\ndemanded a place in the review for his young disciple, Guy de\r\nMaupassant. Littré, too, approved of the enterprise. He agreed to\r\nwrite articles on philosophy. But Girardin was appalled at the\r\ncapital such an undertaking would require. Mme. Adam was known to\r\nbe wealthy, her husband having left her a considerable fortune.\r\nNevertheless, so many other similar enterprises—_La Revue Nationale_,\r\n_La Revue Germanique_, _La Revue de Paris_—had foundered miserably,\r\nhaving failed to hold their own against the veteran _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_. Girardin had grave doubts as to the possibility of success.\r\nNevertheless, he thought it an excellent idea to replace the waning\r\ninfluence of her salon by that of a review in which she could say\r\nanything and criticise everything. He advised her to found a company,\r\nin which she should take half the shares; and he himself promised to\r\nbecome a shareholder.\r\n\r\nGambetta Mme. Adam found far from encouraging. “Whatever is this mad\r\nidea of founding a review?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Nothing is more serious,” she replied. “As republican politics\r\nseem to have resolved themselves into nothing more nor less than a\r\ndistribution of rewards, my political salon has ceased to interest me.\r\nIt is about to be transformed into a literary salon with the solid\r\nsupport of a review.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t carry on your review for six months,” he retorted.... “You\r\ndon’t know what you are undertaking. How could a woman ever possess\r\nenough authority, knowledge, energy, and business faculty to direct a\r\nreview?” Gambetta carefully ignored the famous _Revue Internationale_,\r\nfounded and successfully edited for some years by Napoléon I.’s\r\ngreat-niece, Mme. Ratazzi, better known by her _nom de guerre_ of\r\n“Baron Stock.”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” replied Juliette Adam, “will you take the trouble\r\nto remember this? I shall carry on my review for twenty years, and I\r\nshall introduce to my readers twenty new authors.”\r\n\r\nThe question of the title puzzled her for some time. Then she writes—\r\n\r\n“_Tiens, j’ai trouvé mon titre_ La Nouvelle Revue. _Ce titre me plaît\r\net plaît à tous. Je l’ai tant cherché, et il est venu tout seul._”\r\n\r\nHer old friend Laurent Pichat, one of those who had always recommended\r\nAdam, “that millionaire in wisdom and moderation,” as he called him,\r\nto found a review, threw himself heart and soul into the project. “You\r\ncannot have too many contributors,” he said.\r\n\r\nIt was chiefly among the young authors and writers that these\r\ncontributors were recruited. “Our review,” they called it, for them\r\nit was founded. One of its main objects was to give the chance to the\r\nyoung and the unknown which _La Revue des Deux Mondes_ denied them.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have seen, many of Mme. Adam’s old friends were also to\r\nbe represented in its pages: Challemel-Lacour, Spuller, and her\r\nfellow-Hellenists Saint-Victor and de Ronchaud. Nothing pleased her\r\nmore than the interest taken in it by M. Ferdinand de Lesseps, a new\r\nacquaintance whom she owed to Girardin.\r\n\r\nAnother of her great acquisitions was Alphonse Daudet, the writer\r\nwho to her seemed more essentially French than any other author of\r\nthat day. She considered him the equal of Balzac and Flaubert. She\r\nhad hardly dared to hope for his collaboration. All the greater,\r\ntherefore, was her joy when he assured her that any project destined\r\nto help forward young writers might count on his support. And Daudet\r\nwas not one to give his name alone. As long as he lived the editress\r\nof _La Nouvelle Revue_ found in him one of her most trusted supporters.\r\n\r\nBut the course of editing, like that of true love, does not always\r\nrun smooth; and Mme. Adam had her disappointments. One of these was\r\nTaine’s refusal to collaborate. On the 29th of March, 1879,[350] he\r\nwrote excusing himself on account of bad health and absence from\r\nParis. Though he was by no means devoted to _La Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_, he reminded the new editress that when an attempt had been\r\nmade fifteen years earlier to give that journal a rival, it had been\r\ncalculated that such a project could not be realised in less than six\r\nyears, and would necessitate an expenditure of a million of francs.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam hoped to carry out her design in two years, and with an\r\nexpenditure of five hundred thousand francs. On this basis and before\r\nthe summer of 1879 was over, the company had been formed. In June,\r\nMme. Adam had left her Paris flat for a house in the Parc de Séchan\r\nat Montmorency. But on a lower floor of the Maison Sallandrouze she\r\nestablished the office of the review. All through July, August and\r\nSeptember she was busy buying paper, negotiating with printers, making\r\nall the preparations for her first number, which was to appear on the\r\n1st of October.\r\n\r\nHer salon—all that was left of it, for she had little time\r\nfor receiving visitors either at Montmorency or at La Maison\r\nSallandrouze—was becoming more and more _le Salon de la Nouvelle\r\nRevue_. “_Je suis tout à la littérature_,” she writes.[351] On her\r\neditor’s desk were accumulating piles and piles of MSS.—poems, plays,\r\nstories, novels, political articles.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of contributors. “_Les adhésions me viennent\r\nen foule_,” she writes.[352] “All those who are suffering from\r\ndisillusionment, who are indignant to see our politicians prefer their\r\npersonal interests to the national cause, come to me.” On the whole,\r\nshe displayed in her choice of contributors a certain eclecticism.\r\nAmong her earliest collaborators we find women as well as men,\r\nProtestants as well as Catholics, not only Frenchmen but foreigners,\r\nthe Russian novelist Tourguénieff, the Spanish statesman Castelar,\r\nthe Hungarian general Turr, the Italian publicist Gioia, the Turk\r\nAbdul-Hakk, while English letters were represented by Sidney Colvin.\r\nSarcey and Théodore Reinach were to contribute literary articles,\r\nTheuriet, François Coppée, Lecomte de Lisle poetry, General Gallifet\r\nand Paul Marchand military articles, Joseph Reinach political.\r\nScience was represented by Camille Flammarion and Stanislas Meunier,\r\nhistory by Thierry and Gebhart, mythology by Elie Reclus, fiction by\r\nErckmann-Chatrian, and others whose names are to-day less known.\r\n\r\nThe first number appeared, as announced, on the 1st of October, 1879.\r\nIt received an excellent welcome.\r\n\r\nThe main object of the review was avowedly nationalist, to glorify\r\nFrance. “With all my heart and soul,” writes the editor,[353] “I am\r\ndetermined to make my review a credit to French letters, a reflection\r\nof republican disinterestedness, patriotism and dignity. What should I\r\ndo ... did I not feel that I am about to create a work which shall be\r\nessentially republican and liberal?”\r\n\r\nDisappointed by the Government’s abandonment of the policy of\r\na territorial _revanche_, Mme. Adam set her heart on realising\r\n_la revanche intellectuelle_. The more she thought of gathering\r\ntogether all the talents, the more forcibly was she impressed by the\r\nintellectual vigour, the scientific, literary and artistic superiority\r\nof her country. “_Notre France est grande_,” she exclaims. “But every\r\none plunders her, and no one dreams of making her wealth known. This\r\nis what I shall do.”\r\n\r\nGambetta, realising how far they had drifted apart, betrayed not a\r\nlittle anxiety as to the political line she was likely to follow.\r\n\r\n“Shall you be as hostile to me as you are to my policy?” he asked.[354]\r\n\r\n“The home truths that I can no longer tell you in my salon I shall\r\ncertainly tell you in my review,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Why, this is practically a declaration of war,” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“No, it is a proclamation of independence.”\r\n\r\nIn her opening address to her readers she did not fail to appear as\r\n_la grande désabusée_. Disappointed with party politics, she looked\r\nforward to a time when party strife should cease and politics rise\r\ninto the serene air of social science. For the next twenty years\r\nof her life Juliette Adam, or Juliette Lamber, as she still signed\r\nherself, was to live her life in _La Nouvelle Revue_. Henceforth\r\nher editorial duties absorbed her too completely to permit of her\r\ntaking notes of conversations and keeping the diary which she has\r\nreproduced in her _Souvenirs_.[355] The last of her seven volumes of\r\nreminiscences closes with the inauguration of _La Nouvelle Revue_.\r\n\r\nNot content with a nominal editorship, Mme. Adam worked\r\nconscientiously in her office, herself reading most of the MSS. sent\r\nin. Methodically planning out her time, she rose early to read MSS.,\r\nreceive contributors, dictate to secretaries. She saw her milliner\r\nat breakfast, dispatching the meal and her orders together. To avoid\r\nwasting precious moments in trying on her own garments, she would\r\ncriticise their fit on a dummy, another famous _mannequin d’osier_,\r\nmoulded exactly to her shape. Then her work would be resumed until it\r\nwas time for the afternoon drive and dinner, followed by a party or\r\nthe play. The small hours of the morning often found her again at her\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\nSuch an expenditure of energy could not possibly continue indefinitely\r\nwithout a breakdown. There came a time when the doctor offered the\r\nalternative of rest or death. But Mme. Adam has always been one of\r\nthose who would willingly die at her task. She prefers to wear out\r\nrather than to rust out. The doctor found his warning unheeded,\r\nconsequently he changed his tactics. When he threatened her with the\r\nloss of her good looks, she immediately gave way. Leaving the review\r\nin the hands of a competent editor, she took several months’ rest; and\r\nwhen she returned to her directorship it was no longer to work with\r\nthe feverish energy of yore. By that time she was surrounded by a band\r\nof talented and zealous helpers, _les jeunes_ whom she had discovered\r\nand to whom she could entrust much of the personal supervision which\r\nin earlier years had devolved upon her alone. One of these lieutenants\r\nwas M. Léon Daudet, the son of her friend Alphonse, and to-day\r\neditor of _L’Action Française_. In his book, _L’Entre-deux-Guerres_,\r\npublished in 1915, M. Daudet draws to the life _la grande Française_,\r\nwhom for a quarter of a century he has been proud to call _ma chère\r\npatronne_.\r\n\r\nHe illustrates Mme. Adam’s social tact in the story he tells of a\r\ndinner-party at his father’s house. That evening the guests were the\r\nDuc d’Aumale, M. de Freycinet, the General de Gallifet, Magnard,\r\neditor of the _Figaro_, the ill-fated Calmette, who was to succeed\r\nhim, and about twenty others. Henry James used to say that French\r\ndinner-parties always somewhat resemble a session of the Convention.\r\nAnd at this party the noise of debate waxed especially high, for the\r\ntalk fell on a subject still delicate: the Commune. And the discussion\r\nmight well have culminated in more than one of the invited sending his\r\nrepresentatives next morning to some fellow-guest, had not Mme. Adam\r\nskilfully smoothed down the angles of controversy and finally led the\r\nconversation on to less dangerous ground.\r\n\r\nFulfilled beyond her greatest expectations were Mme. Adam’s hopes\r\nthat her review might serve young writers and French literature by\r\nrevealing new talent. For it was in the pages of this magazine that\r\nFrench readers first became acquainted with many of _les jeunes_\r\nwho to-day occupy the very first rank. Pierre Loti, Paul Bourget,\r\nMarcelle Tinayre and Anatole France are some of those who in _La\r\nNouvelle Revue_ first began to climb the ladder of fame. Here appeared\r\nPierre Loti’s first novel, _Le Mariage de Loti_, followed by _Le\r\nRoman d’un Spahi_ and _Fleurs d’Ennui_. Those _Essais de Psychologie\r\nContemporaine_, which many regard as Paul Bourget’s most valuable\r\ncontribution to French letters, Mme. Adam had the honour of publishing\r\nin 1884, as well as several of the same author’s early novels:\r\n_L’Irréparable_, _Deuxième Amour_, _Cruelle Enigme_, _Crime d’Amour_,\r\nwhich all appeared in the early eighties. Many years later, in 1898,\r\nadvised by Alphonse Daudet, who had read the manuscript, Mme. Adam\r\nintroduced to her readers the first novel of that gifted woman writer,\r\nMarcelle Tinayre.\r\n\r\nOne of Mme. Adam’s first meetings with Anatole France was in 1879,\r\nwhen they travelled together to a party given by La Société des Gens\r\nde Lettres in Edmond About’s park at Malabry. Then, as we may well\r\nimagine, Mme. Adam was so charmed by the gifted young French author\r\nthat she enrolled him among _les jeunes_ of her review; and in the\r\nnext year appeared in its pages _Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard_,\r\nfollowed two years later by _Le Petit Bonhomme_, which was to be\r\npublished in volume under the title of _Pierre Nozière_.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam and Anatole France remained friends until the Dreyfus\r\naffair. Then, like so many other friends, they parted company.\r\nMme. Adam’s nationalism involved antagonism to the Jews, whom she\r\nbelieved incapable of espousing the cause of any race but their\r\nown. It involved also a belief that the army can do no wrong. Hence\r\nshe regarded as final the court-martial’s condemnation of Alfred\r\nDreyfus. Anatole France, on the other hand, who was at that time _le\r\ngrand homme_ of a famous Semitic salon, became a fervent Dreyfusard.\r\nThe _Affaire_ resulted in a curious reshuffle in French social and\r\npolitical life. M. France found himself ranged with some who had\r\nonce been his enemies. One of these was Émile Zola. In the past, his\r\ngross realism had outraged the classical and aristocratic taste of\r\nM. France as much as it had that of Mme. Adam. But now, battling in\r\na common cause, these two former foes found one another by no means\r\nantipathetic. While reconciled with old enemies, however, M. France\r\nfound himself parted from old friends; not from Mme. Adam only, but\r\nfrom one who had been a close comrade of his earlier literary career,\r\nfrom Paul Bourget. With Pierre Loti and with her whom they were\r\nboth proud to call their intellectual mother, M. Bourget took the\r\nnationalist side. He also, disappointed with the Republic’s failure\r\nto realise his ideals, was turning Romewards. We may regard him, with\r\nMme. Adam, as the first fruits of that Catholic revival which was\r\nto be the dominant note of French intellectual society in the early\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[344] _Souvenirs_, VII. 87.\r\n\r\n[345] _Souvenirs_, VI. 470.\r\n\r\n[346] _Ibid._, VII. 241.\r\n\r\n[347] _Ibid._, 331.\r\n\r\n[348] _Souvenirs_, III. 227.\r\n\r\n[349] _Ibid._, VII. 321.\r\n\r\n[350] _Souvenirs_, VII. 365.\r\n\r\n[351] _Souvenirs_, VII. 404.\r\n\r\n[352] _Ibid._, 366.\r\n\r\n[353] _Ibid._, 392.\r\n\r\n[354] _Souvenirs_, VII. 324.\r\n\r\n[355] _Après l’Abandon de la Revanche._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nVIEWS ON FOREIGN POLITICS\r\n\r\n1878-1917\r\n\r\n     “_La Politique extérieure qui a toujours été la grande\r\n     préoccupation, le grand apprentissage de ma vie._”—Mme. Edmond\r\n     Adam, _Souvenirs_, VII. 218.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortnight after the appearance of the first number of _La Nouvelle\r\nRevue_, on the 17th of December, 1879, Émile de Girardin gave a\r\ndinner-party; _un dîner de gala_ it was called by Mme. Adam, who was\r\none of the guests. Among other distinguished persons present were Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Gladstone and Gambetta.[356] At dessert the talk fell on the\r\nnew review; and Mr. Gladstone asked the editress what were its objects.\r\n\r\n“I have three,” she replied: “to oppose Bismarck, to demand the\r\nrestoration of Alsace-Lorraine, and to lift from the minds of our\r\nyoung writers the shadow of depression cast by national defeat by\r\ngiving them fame ten years earlier than they would otherwise have\r\nacquired it.”\r\n\r\n“And you expect to accomplish your three objects?” Mr. Gladstone\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not all of them,” replied Mme. Adam. “But of one thing I am\r\ncertain: that I shall see Bismarck’s fall during the existence of the\r\nreview.”\r\n\r\n“Gambetta, who was listening,” adds Mme. Adam, “smiled defiantly at\r\nthese words. _Gambetta, qui écoutait, eut un sourire et un regard\r\nde défi._” He may have smiled. But it is more than probable that\r\nhis defiant air existed alone in his friend’s imagination. For, as\r\nshe herself has frankly confessed elsewhere, Gambetta was never\r\nmalicious.[357]\r\n\r\n“What are you yourself going to write in your review?” Gambetta\r\nasked. “Doubtless you will appropriate foreign politics.”[358]\r\nGambetta was right. And by no means the least valuable and striking\r\ncontributions to the review were those fortnightly letters on foreign\r\npolitics—_Lettres sur La Politique Extérieure_, which for twenty years\r\nMme. Adam never ceased to contribute, and which she continued to\r\nwrite for some months after the magazine had passed out of her hands.\r\nHer last letter appeared in June 1900. In 1916 she collected all her\r\narticles bearing on Bismarck and his policy and published them in a\r\nvolume entitled _L’Heure Vengeresse des Crimes Bismarckiens_. Her\r\narticles on the Emperor William II have likewise been collected and\r\npublished in book form under the title of _Guillaume II_. (1890-1899).\r\n\r\nIn everything Mme. Adam wrote throughout these one-and-twenty years,\r\n_la Revanche_ was the dominating idea. Nevertheless, we cannot too\r\noften repeat that which we have said in a foregoing chapter:[359] she\r\nnever advocated an aggressive war with Germany, even for the purpose\r\nof regaining the lost territory.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, at the close of the Schnœbele Incident, one of those Teutonic\r\npin-pricks by which Germany was for ever stirring up French hostility,\r\nMme. Adam wrote in _La Nouvelle Revue_:[360] “Whatever our enemy may\r\nthink, his neighbours on the west have long ago lost their craving for\r\nthe battle-field. Thither they no longer hasten madly; but thither if\r\nattacked they will march resolutely.”\r\n\r\nMme. Adam’s object in perpetually harping on _la Revanche_ was to\r\nkeep France in a state of preparedness for the attack she felt\r\nconvinced could not fail to come, and also to assure her brethren\r\nin Alsace-Lorraine that they had not been forgotten. Her policy was\r\nthe reverse of Gambetta’s _pensons y toujours n’en parlons jamais_.\r\nShe believed in for ever, in season and out of season, speaking and\r\nwriting of _la Revanche_.\r\n\r\n_La Revanche_ was by no means the only subject on which Juliette\r\nAdam and Gambetta had fundamentally disagreed. They had differed,\r\nfor instance, on the question of the attitude which France, after\r\nher defeat, should assume towards Europe, notably at the time of the\r\nBerlin Congress, in 1878.\r\n\r\nThe place of the meeting alone would have sufficed to provoke Mme.\r\nAdam’s hostility to the Congress. For France, at the conqueror’s\r\nbidding, to go to his capital there to discuss, without mentioning\r\nher own wrong, the affairs of Europe on the basis of the _status\r\nquo_, seemed to _la grande Française_ nothing but a new humiliation.\r\nAnd this view finds justification in Professor Oncken’s contribution\r\nto the _Cambridge Modern History_.[361] Here, in accents of pride,\r\nthe German Professor describes the Congress, which brought statesmen\r\nfrom every European country to the capital of the new empire, as a\r\nmagnificent acknowledgment of the position of Germany, and one of\r\nBismarck’s greatest achievements. One cannot help sympathising with\r\nMme. Adam’s patriotism when she protests against a French contribution\r\nto this new crown of glory for the German Empire.\r\n\r\nWhile Gambetta argued that France, by standing out of the Congress,\r\nwould lose in prestige, Mme. Adam maintained that she would gain\r\nby standing aloof as a Power which it was necessary to win over.\r\nMoreover, she told Gambetta that her friend, Cialdini, the Italian\r\nAmbassador in Paris, had assured her that if France should refuse to\r\nbe represented at the Congress Italy would follow her example.\r\n\r\nSuch having been Mme. Adam’s attitude towards the Congress from the\r\nbeginning, she naturally inclined to find fault with all the decisions\r\nand arrangements made at Berlin.\r\n\r\nShe was in Rome when the Congress closed on the 13th of July. “_Jour\r\nnéfaste_,” she writes, “_s’il en fût jamais. Le Congrès de Berlin\r\nse termine. L’encouragement aux troubles, aux ambitions futures est\r\nsigné._”[362] And now that well-nigh forty years have passed she\r\nstill regards ce jour néfaste as a black-letter day. “_Le Congrès de\r\nBerlin_,” she wrote only last year, “_ma bête noire, l’un des deux\r\nmotifs pour lesquels je me suis brouillée politiquement avec mes\r\nmeilleurs amis_.”[363]\r\n\r\nAs Russia’s faithful friend[364] and the ardent advocate of a\r\nFranco-Russian alliance, Mme. Adam strongly resented Russia’s\r\ntreatment at Berlin. She suspected that one of Bismarck’s ideas in\r\nsummoning the Congress had been to rob Russia of the fruits of her\r\nvictories in the Russo-Turkish War. She saw that as a result of the\r\nCongress Russia had become as isolated in the East as was France in\r\nthe West. That Russians were themselves of this opinion was proved,\r\nwhen on leaving Berlin the Russian Chancellor Gortchakoff declared\r\n“the Congress to have been the darkest page in his career.”\r\n\r\nGambetta’s attitude towards Russia has puzzled not a few. It must\r\never be difficult to discover the personal views of so opportunist a\r\nstatesman. “The real truth about Gambetta’s life, death and opinions\r\nwill never be known,” said recently one of those with whom he was\r\nmost intimately acquainted. In his early conversations with Mme.\r\nAdam he annoyed her extremely by his mistrust of Russia, which he\r\nshared with most French Radicals of that day, and which resulted\r\nfrom Russia’s autocratic Government and her treatment of the Poles.\r\nFor Mme. Adam, to be the enemy of Germany was to be the friend of\r\nRussia. “_Anti-allemande passionnée et violente, j’étais logiquement\r\nslavophile_,” she writes.[365] And in one of the numerous quarrels\r\nwith Gambetta at the time of his proposed interview with Bismarck, she\r\nconfesses that she darted at him this insult: “You are Prussian, I\r\nremain Cossack.” But Gambetta was well inured to such venomous words\r\nfrom his too candid friend; and the patient endurance with which he\r\nsuffered them speaks volumes both for his equanimity and for Mme.\r\nAdam’s powers of fascination.\r\n\r\nIf France must needs emerge from her isolation and form an alliance\r\nwith some European Power, Gambetta would have preferred that Power\r\nto be England rather than Russia. Mme. Adam, animated by her Picard\r\ndislike of England, unable to forgive us for standing aloof in 1870,\r\nwould not hear of an English Alliance. There came a time, however,\r\nwhen Gambetta began to see that both an English and a Russian alliance\r\nmight be necessary to protect France against German aggression.\r\nDimly foreshadowing the Triple Entente of a quarter of a century\r\nlater, he began to overcome his dislike of Russia. Writing to Mme.\r\nAdam in January 1877,[366] he says in reference to Russia’s alarm\r\nat Bismarck’s designs on the Baltic Provinces: “_Le ressentiment\r\nest flagrant chez les Russes, il s’agit de l’exploiter_.” Gambetta,\r\nhowever, does not take to himself the credit of originating the idea\r\nof the Franco-Russo-British Entente. In his recently published\r\nletters to his friend and supporter Ranc,[367] he ascribes this idea\r\nto the Prince of Wales (afterwards Edward VII), whom, in February\r\n1878, he met more than once at the Café Anglais. By the Prince’s\r\ninsight into European politics Gambetta was deeply impressed. In this\r\nmatter he was far from sharing the views of a recent English writer\r\non King Edward.[368] Was that growing passion for luxury, that love\r\nof fashionable life, which Mme. Adam so frequently deplores, casting\r\na spell over Gambetta and warping his judgment so far as to make him\r\nattribute to his royal acquaintance opinions which were really his\r\nown? We cannot say. But at any rate, in this letter to Ranc, Gambetta\r\ndescribes His Royal Highness as predicting that Russia would find\r\nher political aspirations in the Near East thwarted by Austria, that\r\nAustria would influence Roumania, that together Austria, Roumania\r\nand Turkey would ally themselves against Russia. “What a conflict!”\r\nexclaims Gambetta. “Nevertheless, this is what the Prince of Wales\r\nforesees. He does not share that hostility to Russia which animates\r\npart of his nation. With all his young authority he opposes any\r\nmeasures likely to injure Russia. He has in him the stuff of a great\r\nstatesman.”\r\n\r\nThat Gambetta over-rated the Prince’s “young authority” (_jeune\r\nautorité_) will be obvious to all acquainted with the British\r\nconstitution, and to those who know what was the position accorded to\r\nthe Prince of Wales during his mother’s reign.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of the Prince of Wales for Russia ought to have\r\npleased Mme. Adam. But she does not record that Gambetta confided\r\nit to her, although he spoke to her frequently of his meetings with\r\nthe Prince.[369] Gambetta protested to her that the Prince was far\r\nfrom being what rumour represented him, a mere _festoyeur_. “He loves\r\nFrance seriously as well as gaily,” said Gambetta. “His great dream of\r\nthe future is an understanding (_une entente_) with us.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Mme. Adam rejoined bitterly: “We know what an understanding\r\nwith England brings to any country, which is so simple as to enter\r\ninto it.”\r\n\r\nIn those days, when Disraeli was Prime Minister, Mme. Adam regarded\r\nwhat she described as “the insatiableness of Great Britain” with an\r\napprehension almost as grave as that inspired by her fear of Germany.\r\nWhile for our liberal statesmen, for Mr. Gladstone and John Bright\r\nnotably, she had a profound admiration; Lord Beaconsfield and Lord\r\nSalisbury she regarded as hand and glove with Bismarck.\r\n\r\nIt was with this triumvirate, she believed, and not without\r\nreason,[370] that had originated at Berlin an idea, which, realised\r\nthree years later, was to prove disastrous not to France alone,\r\nbut to the peace of Europe. This idea was the French occupation of\r\nTunis. The colonisation of Tunis had long been an Italian dream. To\r\nnorthern Africa Mazzini had directed the ambitions of his countrymen\r\nas early as 1838.[371] Probably British statesmen, by suggesting\r\nTunis to France merely intended to give her something which should\r\natone to her for the British occupation of Cyprus. But Bismarck\r\nhad other designs: he wished above all things to distract French\r\nattention from the north-eastern frontier. As later he was to say\r\nto a French diplomatist: “Go to Morocco, it will help you to forget\r\nAlsace-Lorraine,” so now for the same reason he encouraged France\r\nto go to Tunis. But there is little doubt that when he gave this\r\nencouragement the wily fox at Varzin was entertaining a yet subtler\r\ndesign: already he had come to an understanding with Austria, and to\r\nthe German-Austrian Entente he was eager to add Italy. By embroiling\r\nItaly with France he hoped to achieve this object, and he succeeded.\r\nThe year after the French occupation of Tunis, Italy joined Germany\r\nand Austria; and on the 20th of May, 1882, the Triple Alliance was\r\nconcluded. Its formation and its periodic renewal[372] rendered yet\r\nmore imperative the conclusion of the Triple Entente. And it will\r\ngenerally be admitted that one of the causes of the present conflict\r\nlies in this unfortunate, though possibly inevitable, arrayal of the\r\ngreat European Powers in two hostile camps.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, in the French colonisation of Tunis, we have an event\r\nfraught with momentous consequences. How did Mme. Adam regard it?\r\nIn the last volume of her _Souvenirs_, which we must remember were\r\ncompiled nearly twenty years later, she sees in it one of Bismarck’s\r\ndesigns for the ruin of France. But, in her articles contributed\r\nat the time to _La Nouvelle Revue_, it is interesting to find her\r\nrefusing at first to believe in the possibility of any alliance\r\nbetween Italy and Austria. Bismarck may plot if he likes; but in that\r\ndirection, not even such an arch-schemer as the German Chancellor\r\ncould possibly succeed. Mme. Adam, herself an irreconcilable\r\n_Revancharde_, felt confident that her Latin brethren in Italy could\r\nnever so far forget their unredeemed territory as to ally themselves\r\nwith the Austrian plunderer, “and to consent to be dragged behind the\r\nchariot of Hapsburgs and Hohenzollerns.” But alas! that swift Gallic\r\nintuition, which had often led her to see into the future of European\r\npolitics, had for the moment forsaken her. Italy was not true to _la\r\nRevanche_. She came to terms with the conqueror. When the Triple\r\nAlliance was formed Mme. Adam saw one of her brightest dreams vanish.\r\nShe had hoped to substitute for Gambetta’s Triple Entente between\r\nFrance, England and Russia another three-cornered understanding, one\r\nbetween France, Italy and Russia.\r\n\r\nNow that Italy had joined the enemy Mme. Adam turned with more\r\nenthusiasm than ever to Russia. Writing[373] of her articles on\r\nforeign politics in _La Nouvelle Revue_, she announces that she will\r\ngive Russia a prominent part. “_Pour mes lettres sur la politique\r\nextérieure_,” she writes, “_mon siège est fait, la lutte à plume\r\narmée contre Bismarck et pour l’alliance russe_.”[374] Already her\r\nfriendship with Tourguénieff had taught her something of the Russian\r\nsoul. She studied Russian history, especially the history of the\r\nrevolutionary movement. She was in constant correspondence with\r\nGeneral Chanzy, the French Ambassador at Petrograd. Finally, in 1882,\r\nshe visited Russia.\r\n\r\nShe stayed at the Hôtel de l’Europe. There she was visited by numerous\r\npersons of distinction. No one impressed her so much as General\r\nSkobeleff, the heroic defender of Plevna. They were well matched,\r\nthese two passionate patriots—this handsome Western woman, _la grande\r\nFrançaise_, and this typical Cossack, this fervent Slav. He was called\r\n“the white General,” because it was his custom to wear, in battle,\r\na white coat, which challenged the enemy’s bullets to defile its\r\nspotless purity with blood-stains. Alike for the Russian Pan-Slavist\r\nand the French _Revancharde_ there was but one device, “the German is\r\nthe enemy.” No one in Russia did Mme. Adam long more to see than this\r\nhero of the Russo-Turkish War. Their meeting, which occurred in the\r\nvast yellow drawing-room of the Hôtel de l’Europe in January 1882, she\r\nhas vividly described in her little book on Skobeleff, first published\r\nin 1886, and reprinted in a revised edition in 1916.\r\n\r\n“We looked at one another,” she writes, “not wishing to make any\r\ntrivial remarks.... It was of his cause I spoke to him before my own.\r\nAnd this is what he said to me about the Balkan peoples: ‛I assure you\r\nthey are tyrannised over. They must fill you with pity. For example,\r\nin Bosnia, in Herzegovina, the oppressor forces the children to serve\r\nin the very army which has slain their fathers and brothers. Into\r\ntheir hands is put a gun all dripping with the blood of Slavs. This\r\nthought drives me mad, as it must you when you think of the people of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine serving in the Prussian army.’\r\n\r\n“‛Yes, but they were actually our brethren, they were so near to us,\r\nthe Slavs of Bosnia and Herzegovina are not so intimately related to\r\nyou.’\r\n\r\n“‛Not these Slavs! Why, they are our brethren,’ he said in a tone\r\nwhich thrilled me through and through. ‛Pray do not let us argue about\r\nthe relative acuteness of our suffering. Russia waged war in order to\r\ndeliver the Slavs beyond the Danube from the Turkish yoke.... And now\r\nshe cannot permit Austria’s yoke to be substituted for Turkey’s. The\r\nformer is also more oppressive, for it tyrannises not merely over the\r\nindividual’s person, but over his conscience....’\r\n\r\n“‛Austria,’ I argued, ‛has for some years been hardly responsible for\r\nher action in the East. It is Germany who is urging her to dominate\r\nover the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula, and to conquer them both by\r\nforce of arms and by diplomacy.’\r\n\r\n“‛Germany!’ he repeated, and into that one word he breathed all the\r\nfire of his hatred.\r\n\r\n“The preachers of the Crusades must have looked like that apostle of\r\nthe Slavs.\r\n\r\n“‛I no longer love war,’ said Skobeleff. ‛No, I love it no longer; I\r\nhave waged it too often,’ he added, as if replying to his own inmost\r\nthought. ‛No victory is worth all it costs of energy, of strength,\r\nof public money and of men. Yet there is a war for which I should\r\never be ready, and which I should never deem too costly. It is a holy\r\nwar. Sooner or later the devourers of the Slavs must be themselves\r\ndevoured. On that day, I see it, I will it, I predict it, Germany will\r\nbe devoured by the Slavs, the Latins, the Franks.’”\r\n\r\nMme. Adam and her new friend had far too much in common for their\r\nfriendship to cease with her departure from Petrograd. He followed her\r\nto Paris. There he visited her salon. They agreed to work together,\r\nto unite all their forces in order to oppose what Skobeleff described\r\nas _le système d’enveloppement bismarckien_. But their hopes were\r\ndisappointed by Skobeleff’s early death at the age of thirty-nine.\r\nShortly before he died he said to one of his compatriots: “Carry\r\non my work, and do not neglect to bring into all your plans our\r\nfriend in Paris.” Mme. Adam is one of those who lay at Bismarck’s\r\ndoor the sudden passing of this brilliant soldier and irreconcilable\r\nGermanophobe. But the Chancellor has enough crimes accredited to him\r\nwithout this. A distinguished French journalist, who knew Skobeleff,\r\nand in many ways greatly admired him, wrote to me recently: “I do\r\nnot believe he was assassinated by orders from Bismarck. I know too\r\nmuch of his death to believe that. _Mais les défauts de ses propres\r\nqualités l’ont conduit à une mort rapide._”\r\n\r\nThe effect of Skobeleff’s influence on Mme. Adam was to render truer\r\nthan ever the words of her friend, Mme. Novikoff: _elle a la Russie au\r\ncœur_.[375] Now with all her heart and soul she began to work for a\r\nFranco-Russian Alliance. It was precisely this alliance that Bismarck\r\nfeared. Mme. Adam’s persistent advocacy of it in the columns of _La\r\nNouvelle Revue_, and the numerous charges on which she never ceased to\r\nindict the Chancellor, provoked him on one occasion to cry out: “Is\r\nthere no one who can silence _cette diablesse de femme_?” The German\r\nAmbassador at Paris is said to have repeated this question to M. Jules\r\nFerry, then Prime Minister. “Only one person,” he replied, “and he\r\nunhappily is dead: her husband, Edmond Adam.” Ferry, however, Mme.\r\nAdam has told me, desiring to obtain German support or acquiescence in\r\nhis policy of colonial expansion, and wishful, therefore, to please\r\nthe German Government, did ask her to discontinue her Germanophobe\r\narticles. “Only if you imprison me,” she replied. “And what an honour!\r\nTo be imprisoned for attacking Bismarck.”\r\n\r\nKeeping closely in touch with her Russian friends Mme. Adam was\r\noverjoyed as the years went on to find sympathy with France growing in\r\nRussia. At first it had existed only among Russian Revolutionaries.\r\nBut it began to spread to the conservatives, and finally to the Czar,\r\nAlexander III, himself. Then came the glorious days of Cronstadt and\r\nToulon. When the French squadron, under Admiral Gervais, entered\r\nCronstadt harbour, on the 25th of July, 1891, Mme. Adam was in an\r\necstasy to hear with what immense enthusiasm it had been received.\r\nWhen, in the following August, the Treaty of Alliance between France\r\nand Russia was signed, Count Ignatieff, the ex-Minister of Interior,\r\nsent her a telegram beginning: “To you is due the honour of having\r\npredicted the sentiments which unite French and Russian hearts,” and\r\nending with the wish that “the bond which unites our two countries may\r\nendure for ever.”[376]\r\n\r\nIn October 1893 a detachment of the Russian fleet entered Toulon\r\nharbour on a return visit. Mme. Adam, we may be sure, took care to\r\nbe in the South of France during that visit. In the festivities with\r\nwhich the Russian soldiers were entertained at Toulon, and later in\r\nParis, she played a prominent part. On behalf of the women of France\r\nshe presented the Russian sailors with numerous gifts, and each\r\nmarried officer received from her hand a gold bracelet for his wife.\r\nOn another occasion, a distinguished Russian, visiting Paris, was\r\nproud to find that Mme. Adam had been deputed to bestow upon him his\r\n_brevet de commandeur de la légion d’honneur_.[377]\r\n\r\nMme. Adam’s sympathies as an ardent Slavophile were by no means\r\nconfined to Russia. No Slavonic people is without a place in her\r\nheart. Their struggles against Teutonism have always appealed to her.\r\nWith Gambetta she believed that one of the surest ways of pulling\r\ndown the Germanic Tower of Babel is to hold out a helping hand to\r\nthe Slavs of the Lower Danube.[378] She has ever been the friend of\r\nRoumania. In _La Nouvelle Revue_ she wrote on the 1st of September,\r\n1881: “Roumania’s attitude will never be aggressive.” Again, in the\r\nsame publication, on the 15th of the month, she continued to preach\r\nconfidence in Roumania: “I believe,” she wrote, “that Roumania,\r\nby reason of her smallness, constitutes the best safeguard of\r\ninternational interests and the surest guarantee of the liberty of a\r\nriver (the Danube) which she has no intention of exploiting for her\r\nown personal ends.”\r\n\r\nThroughout the eighties and nineties, whenever she could escape\r\nfrom her editorial duties in Paris, Mme. Adam would start off on\r\nsome journey to Central Europe—to Vienna, Hungary, North Italy or\r\nMontenegro.[379] Thus she has been able to study on the spot the\r\nNear Eastern question. And for twenty years she conducted in Austria\r\nand the Balkans a veritable crusade on behalf of nationalism,\r\nanti-Teutonism and Slavism. Everywhere her charm of manner and her\r\nacquaintance with Ambassadors in Paris obtained for her an entry into\r\ndiplomatic circles; and it may well be imagined that the insight she\r\nthus gained into the most complex of European problems was invaluable\r\nto her in writing her articles on foreign politics for _La Nouvelle\r\nRevue_.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, during her visit to Hungary, which she has described in\r\nher book, _La Patrie Hongroise_, she found herself up against a\r\ndifficulty, the stubbornness of which she had not suspected. She was\r\ndismayed by the Magyar indignation at her Slavist propaganda. For\r\nthe Magyars Russia was as much “the enemy” as was Germany for French\r\n_Revanchards_. Socially, the Nationalist party was charmed to receive\r\nher; on that field, as always, she proved irresistible; but her\r\nSlavist gospel they rejected with scorn. After her return to Paris\r\nthe leader of the Hungarian nationalists, Count Apponyi, wrote her a\r\nletter expressing irreconcilable antagonism to Russia. He declared\r\nthat in case of a conflict between Russia and Germany, Hungary’s\r\ninstinct of self-preservation would lead her to place her army of\r\n600,000 men[380] at Germany’s disposal. Again, in June 1888, Count\r\nApponyi wrote: “Even under the charm of your pen, madame, the most\r\ningenuous of readers cannot help smiling to see the name of Russia\r\ncoupled with any ideal whatsoever.... We for centuries have been the\r\nsafeguard of civilisation. We arrested that wave of barbarism, the\r\ninflow of the Turks, which broke against our frontier. The same fate\r\nwill attend the Russian wave.”\r\n\r\nIn no country did Mme. Adam more passionately espouse the national\r\ncause than in Egypt. Here her motto was, “Egypt for the Egyptians.”\r\nShe had great faith in the Egyptian people, and she strongly approved\r\nof the French refusal to join the British in their bombardment of\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s action in this matter was a sad blow to her admiration\r\nof this illustrious statesman. She had regarded him as the apostle\r\nof the oppressed, as “the initiator of democracy.” She had admired\r\nhis championship of Armenia and Bulgaria and of Home Rule in Ireland.\r\nOf the Irish problem, she had written: “Mr. Gladstone is the only\r\nman, not in Great Britain alone, but in Europe, capable of dealing\r\nwith such a desperate situation.”[381] Contrasting the British Prime\r\nMinister with the German Chancellor, she writes:[382] “While Europeans\r\nare accustomed to await in agonising suspense the acts and speeches of\r\nM. de Bismarck, they await in hope and in confidence the utterances of\r\nMr. Gladstone.”\r\n\r\nWhen she saw Mr. Gladstone taking what seemed to her the\r\nanti-nationalist side in Egypt, she could only believe that he had\r\nbeen forced into this _concession fatale_ by “British mercantile\r\nChauvinists” and Palmerstonians.[383] Mr. Gladstone’s good-will\r\ntowards France she never doubted; but she deplored that it had been\r\nunable to permeate the British Foreign Office.[384]\r\n\r\nThe influence of mercantile Chauvinism Mme. Adam discerned in the\r\nFashoda Affair. It was then giving birth to that British Imperialism,\r\nwhich whether advocated by Mr. Chamberlain or Lord Rosebery[385]\r\nseemed to her equally dangerous. In the South African War she saw what\r\nshe had described as _l’insatiable ambition des agents britanniques_\r\nin Egypt, developing into _la voracité scandaleuse de l’Angleterre en\r\nTransvaal_.[386]\r\n\r\nIt was with some dismay, however, that on this question of the Boer\r\nRepublic’s Independence Mme. Adam found herself in line with her\r\narch-enemy, the Emperor of Germany. And one can hardly congratulate\r\nher on the fiction with which she tried to extricate herself from\r\nsuch a lamentable position; for she genuinely persuaded herself that\r\nWilliam II was only supporting Kruger in order to please his subjects,\r\nand that in reality Queen Victoria’s grandson could not fail to side\r\nwith his grandmother.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam’s hereditary suspicion of _la perfide Albion_ was, as she\r\nherself confessed to me, by no means allayed by the Entente Cordiale.\r\nIt was not until Great Britain retrieved the error of 1870, and\r\ndefinitely entered the Great War as the Ally of France, that this\r\n_grande Française_ began to trust us.\r\n\r\nThat she has completely changed her opinion of us, and that she is not\r\nashamed to own it, is proved by this extract from one of her letters\r\nwritten to me in 1916. She is referring to an Englishman who had\r\nrecently visited her at Gif....\r\n\r\n                                        “_Abbaye de Gif_,\r\n                                          “_S. et Oise_,\r\n                                              “_Le 8 octobre, 1916_.\r\n\r\n     “... _Comme le grand député capitaine respire la volonté, la\r\n     conviction, le patriotisme! Quelle joie d’apprendre nos alliés si\r\n     autrement que je croyais les connaître._”\r\n\r\nOne of her British _confrères_, she describes as _le plus parfait\r\ngentilhomme du monde_. Now in 1917 she writes: “_L’Angleterre est\r\nadmirable. Vive l’Angleterre._ Her improvised army is worth the most\r\nancient of armies. Be proud of it. Such words on my lips are not\r\nwithout their value. For I was once your enemy. I blamed your policy\r\nat the Berlin Congress and in Heligoland.” “Now, side by side, _fer à\r\nfer_, France and the United Kingdom will drive out of France, out of\r\nLorraine, out of Belgium, the German, who is the enemy of us all.”[387]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we must not omit to note that Mme. Adam’s classical\r\ninterests could not fail to lead her to sympathise with the national\r\nmovement in Greece and with the ideals of her friend, Venizelos,\r\nwith whom she has corresponded during the present war. We are not\r\nsurprised to learn that the leader of Greek Nationalists welcomed with\r\nenthusiasm the publication of Mme. Adam’s book, _L’Heure Vengeresse\r\ndes Crimes Bismarckiens_. For his poor distracted land has indeed\r\nbeen one of the worst sufferers from Bismarck’s crimes, and from the\r\ndecisions taken by that _bête noir_ of Mme. Adam, the Berlin Congress.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[356] _Souvenirs_, VII. 419.\r\n\r\n[357] _Ibid._, VI. 312.\r\n\r\n[358] _Ibid._, 324.\r\n\r\n[359] See _ante_, 189.\r\n\r\n[360] _L’Heure Vengeresse des Crimes Bismarckiens_, 100.\r\n\r\n[361] Vol. XII. 143.\r\n\r\n[362] _Souvenirs_, VII. 204.\r\n\r\n[363] Article in _Le Gaulois_, February 20, 1916.\r\n\r\n[364] The Russian Revolution has but served to strengthen Mme.

Adam’s life. It had put an end to her salon and to\r\nher Mémoires. It had also prevented her from wintering in the South\r\nof France. Only at rare intervals could she find time to spend a few\r\nweeks at her beloved Bruyères. As time went on and as family, as well\r\nas business, ties multiplied in the north, Bruyères was more and more\r\nneglected, then entirely forsaken, and finally sold.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to be near her work, and also to be near her daughter\r\nand her daughter’s children, she exchanged her villa on Le Golfe Juan\r\nfor a picturesque country house, L’Abbaye de Gif, in Seine et Oise.\r\nThis new abode is but an hour’s train journey from Paris. It also\r\nborders on the lands of that famous convent, Port Royal des Champs.\r\nWith the spirit of the great Port Royalists, of Pascal and of Racine,\r\nMme. Adam communes as she writes. It was in the Abbey of Gif that\r\nsome of the nuns from Port Royal took refuge when their settlement\r\nwas broken up and their lands confiscated by Louis-Quatorze. Now the\r\npresent Abbess of Gif, as her friends like to call Mme. Adam, sitting\r\nup in her Abbey tower far on into the night, watching the white mist\r\nrising from the valley, beholds in it forms which seem to her the\r\nsisters of Old France beckoning _la grande Française_ away from her\r\nearly paganism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF THE ABBEY OF GIF IN THE PARK OF MADAME ADAM’S\r\nPRESENT HOME]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine surroundings more essentially French\r\nthan those amidst which Juliette Adam spends the evening of her days.\r\nHigh above the large and commodious house, with its spacious salon,\r\nfilled with memorials of its mistress’s travels, rise in the park\r\nthe ruins of the Abbey refectory and chapel. The ivy which covers\r\nthem our Abbess, who has ever been an enthusiastic gardener, tenderly\r\ntrims with her own hand, despite her fourscore years. Gradually, under\r\nher direction, new portions of the ruins are being excavated. Every\r\ntime one visits Gif one finds some fresh part of the Abbey has been\r\nunearthed. Each stone as it is dug up Mme. Adam reveres as a relic of\r\n_le Grand Siècle_. There is not one of those mute memorials of past\r\nglory which Mme. Adam’s vivid Gallic imagination does not invest with\r\nsome special physiognomy; this is like Juno’s sacred owl, that bears\r\nthe semblance of a Gorgon. “And is not this the image of _le Père\r\nEternel_?” she said to me, pointing to a rocky fragment in the centre\r\nof her _bois sacré_. I, alas! was afflicted with blindness. I was as\r\ndull of comprehension as the mother of the little boy who, asking her\r\nson what he was drawing and being told it was God, answered, “But no\r\none knows what He is like,” and was promptly crushed by the answer,\r\n“When I have finished they will know.”\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful country home Mme. Adam practises with a success no\r\nless signal than that of her old friend, Victor Hugo, the art of being\r\na grandparent.\r\n\r\nHer daughter Alice had married in February 1873 a brilliant young\r\nmedical student, Paul Segond, who became one of the leaders of the\r\nmedical profession in France.[388] “Do not marry your daughter into\r\na circle too political,” had been George Sand’s advice. But George\r\nSand’s young friend “Topaz” had married herself; for her mother had\r\nsuffered too much from a _mariage de convenance_ to wish to impose\r\none on her daughter. Though the bridegroom was no politician, his\r\nmother-in-law’s political fervour could not refrain from introducing\r\ninto the wedding ceremony a political significance. The chief\r\nwitnesses who signed the marriage register were Louis Blanc, the\r\nleader of the old Republicans, and Gambetta, the leader of the new.\r\nAt the ball in the evening the appearance of the ex-Mayoress of the\r\nconquered town of Mulhouse, Mme. Koechlin-Schwartz, wearing in her\r\nwhite hair a tricolour cockade, reminded the guests of the national\r\ndefeat and of _la Revanche_. The ex-Mayoress was escorted by her\r\nhusband the Mayor, whom the Prussians had two years before held as a\r\nhostage.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before the wedding George Sand, in her New Year’s letter\r\nto Juliette Adam, had written: “Who knows whether the year which opens\r\nto-morrow may not make you a grandmother?”[389]\r\n\r\n“_C’est aller vite_,” exclaimed her friend. “My daughter will be\r\nmarried in February. But if the year does not bring me the joy\r\nof being a grandmother, it may give me the hope of being one. In\r\nany case, it will make me the mother of a big son, my daughter’s\r\nhusband. To have children by my two children! Ah! I should go mad\r\nwith joy. No persons in the world have I envied so much as Mme. Sand\r\nand Mme. Dorian, who are grandmothers. And I, who am much younger\r\nthan they, I shall see my granddaughters marry and I shall become a\r\ngreat-grandmother. _Ah! les superbes chaines enchainantes que celles\r\nde la famille!_ And to think that there are those who would break\r\nthem! _Les malheureux et les misérables!_”\r\n\r\nThings did not move quite so quickly as George Sand had anticipated.\r\nThree years elapsed before Juliette Adam, at the age of forty, could\r\nrevel in the raptures of grandmotherhood, before she could place in\r\nthe _adorable Moise_, the gift of George Sand, Alice’s wee daughter,\r\nPauline. Mme. Sand sent with the cradle a long letter of advice as\r\nto the conduct of a grandmother. Juliette had her own views on that\r\nsubject: on the day of Pauline’s birth she began to powder her hair\r\nand to wish henceforth to be taken not so much for a woman of charm as\r\nfor _une femme de valeur_.\r\n\r\n“At what age did you first begin to love your grandchildren?” asked\r\nVictor Hugo, during one of their long talks on the mysteries of\r\ngrandparentage.\r\n\r\n“I loved my first little granddaughter passionately from the very\r\nfirst,” Mme. Adam replied; “as soon as I received her in my apron.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! What blessed privileges you grandmothers enjoy!” sighed the mere\r\ngrandfather. “You who can receive new-born infants in your apron!”[390]\r\n\r\nMme. Adam’s one regret as a grandmother is that her three\r\ngranddaughters did not marry earlier. Had they only taken to\r\nthemselves husbands at her own early age, she would by now have been a\r\ngreat-great as well as a great-grandmother.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is a numerous _petit monde_ which flocks out to Gif\r\nin the Easter and summer holidays to play round the palm-tree from\r\nPierre Loti’s garden in the south, to act charades in the rustic\r\ntheatre, to partake of _goûter_ in the cabaret with its quaintly\r\nfrescoed walls, and to awake with their merry laughter the shades of\r\nthose gay damsels of _la Vieille France_, Mlle. de Sévigné and Mlle.\r\nMarie Racine, who in the days of _le Grand Monarque_ were educated\r\nwithin the Abbey walls.\r\n\r\n“_Ah! que c’est beau, que c’est Français_,” we exclaim with an eminent\r\nFrench artist, as we gaze down from the terrace of Gif over the broad,\r\nfertile valley, with its white ribbon of a road winding up from the\r\nlittle railway station, to the low distant hills fringed with those\r\ngraceful, feathery trees which Corot loved to paint. Here, at the\r\narched Abbey gate, stands the Abbess herself, receiving her guests\r\nwith the stateliness of _une grande dame_, a winning smile lighting up\r\nher grey eyes and illuminating her clear-cut features.\r\n\r\nMme. Adam has never been one who could completely cut herself off\r\nfrom Paris. Though she seldom goes to Paris now, Paris comes to her.\r\nAnd in her salon at Gif she keeps alive _cette causerie française_,\r\nwhich, alas! tends to disappear from the salons of the metropolis.\r\nIn the hurly-burly of modern life that leisurely talk which alone,\r\nwrites Mme. Adam, _entretient les vitalités de notre esprit_ grows\r\nmore and more impossible. Before the war conversation was already\r\na lost art. “When I begin to talk in a modern drawing-room,” says\r\nMme. Adam, “I am told to be silent because I am interrupting a game\r\nof bridge, or because some one is going to dance the tango.” And\r\neven on those rare occasions when conversation was permitted, it was\r\nfound that the dull weight of the Germanic spirit, then permeating\r\nFrench intellectual society, had extinguished the sparkle of French\r\ntalk, had blunted the rapier of French irony. The professor with his\r\nmonologue had insinuated himself into French drawing-rooms, silencing\r\nthose scintillating interruptions, forbidding the smart give-and-take\r\nof brilliant repartee. “We are told,” protests Mme. Adam, “that our\r\nconversation is not _documenté_.”\r\n\r\n_La causerie française_, banished from the salon, was taking refuge in\r\nthe club and the café. Has not Mme. Adam’s own _fils adoptif_, Léon\r\nDaudet, lately written:[391] “_Le café est l’école de la franchise et\r\nde la drôlerie spontanée, tandis que le salon est en général l’école\r\ndu poncif et de la mode imbécile_”?\r\n\r\nBut of Mme. Adam’s salon Daudet makes a notable exception. Of\r\nthe Sunday and Tuesday afternoons at Gif he has painted a vivid\r\npicture,[392] to which may be added not a few interesting features.\r\nWhile of yore to the Sundays and Tuesdays of Gif Paris came by\r\ncarriage or train, to-day it comes by automobile. Motorists have\r\neverything made easy for them: they are provided with a clear\r\nroad-plan printed on a neat little card indicating the route from the\r\nSuresne Gate of the Bois de Boulogne as far as the spot where, but a\r\nfew miles from their destination, friendly sign-posts begin to point\r\n_à l’Abbaye de Gif_. Before the war, on fine Sunday afternoons, on the\r\nterrace of Gif, might be found assembled sometimes as many as fifty\r\npersons, Royalists and Republicans, generals and admirals, bishops\r\nand deputies, academicians and journalists, among whose conflicting\r\nopinions their hostess’s tact and cordiality contrived to keep the\r\npeace in a marvellous manner.\r\n\r\nWith a merry laugh as gay as the blue sky of France, she would set\r\nto play together or to act in a charade journalists and authors who\r\nbut a few days before had been at loggerheads. To Judet of _L’Eclair_\r\nshe would give the opportunity of being revenged at skittles on his\r\nantagonist, that abusive Léon Daudet who in _L’Action Française_ was\r\ngiven to denouncing him as _ce vain colosse_, “outvying in foppishness\r\nthe goose and the peacock.” She would compel Maurice Barrès to\r\ndisguise his boredom as he listened to the latest lucubration of his\r\naged fellow-academician, Jean Aicard. She would severely lecture Paul\r\nBourget on the looseness of that unacademical expression _cependant\r\nque_. She would dispel the melancholy of the author of _Fantôme\r\nd’Orient_ and _Fleurs d’Ennui_ until, like the gayest of butterflies,\r\nhe disported himself in the sunshine of her presence. And then, with a\r\nwave of her wand, she would summon the whole company to her theatre\r\nto help in devising a charade which should render that impossible word\r\n_autobus_ set by la Duchesse d’Uzès.\r\n\r\nIn the quietude of week-days at Gif, and after she had retired from\r\n_La Nouvelle Revue_ in 1899, Mme. Adam found time to review the\r\nvaried episodes of her romantic life, to sort her old papers, to fix\r\nher recollections of persons, things and movements, and to arrange\r\nand publish them in seven volumes of _Souvenirs_, which appeared at\r\nintervals between 1902 and 1910.[393]\r\n\r\n“It may be well,” she writes in her Preface to the first volume, “to\r\nfix a departing age before the eyes of those who are hurrying towards\r\nan age which is dawning. It is the pleasure and the privilege of old\r\npeople to tell of yesterday’s happenings, especially if they do not\r\ninsist upon the superiority of and perpetually draw a moral from that\r\nwhich has disappeared.”\r\n\r\nJuliette Adam had from an early age cultivated the excellent habit of\r\nkeeping a diary, and making notes of the interesting conversations she\r\nheard while they were fresh in her memory.[394] Sometimes, in order to\r\nmake sure of their accuracy, she would revise these notes with friends\r\npresent on the same occasions. One of her volumes of _Souvenirs_, _Mes\r\nIllusions et nos Souffrances pendant le siège de Paris_, had appeared\r\nearlier, in 1871, first as a serial in the newspaper _Le Rappel_, and\r\nlater in volume, with the title _Journal du Siège_. This part of her\r\ndiary, originally intended for her daughter, had a great success. When\r\nit was appearing in _Le Rappel_, Mme. Adam’s life-long friend, Henri\r\nde Rochefort, was undergoing imprisonment for the part he had played\r\nin the Commune. He wrote to her from his prison:[395] “The success\r\nof your _Siège de Paris_ here is insupportable. Every one tries to\r\nsteal my newspaper, and I do nothing but endeavour to recover it.\r\nSome of our convicts are actually copying the serial. After the next\r\namnesty you will have the greatest difficulty in the world in escaping\r\nnomination as candidate for the chamber of deputies. So exactly have\r\nyou photographed the physiognomy of Paris that every day, as I read\r\nyou, I discover things which I had entirely forgotten, and which I see\r\nagain as I did when they were happening.”\r\n\r\nMme. Adam had distinguished herself among her fellow-countrywomen\r\nby the foundation and brilliant editing of _La Nouvelle Revue_. Now\r\nin these seven volumes of recollections, written in a forcible and\r\ndramatic style, stamped each one with the hall-mark of sincerity,\r\nvirility and passionate patriotism, she stood out above all other\r\nFrenchwomen. That such striking volumes should create a sensation,\r\nthat they should cause antagonism as well as admiration, was\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nArdent republicans of the Gambettist school accused Mme. Adam of\r\ninjustice towards one who had once been her idol and her friend. A\r\nfellow-nationalist, M. Henri Galli, wrote a book, _Gambetta et Alsace\r\nLorraine_, with the set purpose of proving that Gambetta had not, as\r\nMme. Adam declared, abandoned the policy of _la Revanche_. The only\r\nanswer to such a contention is that Gambetta was an opportunist, and\r\nthat passages from his speeches may be quoted to prove the correctness\r\nof both Mme. Adam’s and M. Galli’s points of view. To those who\r\naccuse Mme. Adam of having vilified and belittled the Great Tribune,\r\nwe may reply that she passed over many things, revealing only those\r\nmatters of his private life which were intimately connected with his\r\npublic career. Against the attacks made upon her, the author of _Mes\r\nSouvenirs_ defended herself ably in the columns of the _Figaro_ and\r\nthe _Gaulois_.\r\n\r\nThe most serious of the charges brought against Mme. Adam is that\r\nof being _un génie démolisseur_. To those who make this accusation\r\nwe would reply that it reveals a complete misunderstanding of Mme.\r\nAdam’s mind and temperament. It is true that her recollections show\r\n_la grande Française_ to be also _la grande Désabusée_, disappointed\r\nwith the imperfect realisation of those high republican ideals held up\r\nbefore her youthful mind by her revolutionary father and his comrades\r\nof 1848. But that one in whom hopefulness and optimism had ever\r\npredominated should now give way to despair, that one so passionately\r\npatriotic should ever completely lose faith in _la patrie_, is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nEven in the days when she saw, to her sorrow, _la patrie_ forgetting\r\n_la Revanche_ and pursuing what seemed to her the disastrous dream of\r\ncolonial dominion, she could still write: “_L’esprit ailé de l’avenir\r\ns’est posé aux confins de notre horizon; il nous apparaît là-bas, là\r\nbas, mais clairement_.”[396] M. Léon Daudet believes that her great\r\nstrength, _sa principale force_, resides in the fact that she has\r\nnever despaired.[397]\r\n\r\nIn the most desperate of situations she is always convinced that _il y\r\na toujours dans un coin une petite chance que l’on n’a pas entrevue_.\r\nAnd what is this _petite chance dans un coin_ which, when the war is\r\nover and Frenchmen have time to think about domestic politics, Mme.\r\nAdam believes may deliver _la patrie_ from the evils of political\r\ncorruption and maladministration, the existence of which cannot be\r\ndenied by the most fervent admirers of France? Mme. Adam’s opinion\r\nis that these serious flaws in the body politic proceed largely from\r\nover-centralisation.\r\n\r\nWith her fellow-nationalist, Charles Maurras,[398] Mme. Adam advocates\r\ndecentralisation. She would like to see the revival of the old\r\nprovincial assemblies. When, in Alsace, France comes into her own\r\nagain, might not that ancient institution, the Alsatian Landschutz,\r\nrespected by the autocratic Louis XIV and even to a certain extent\r\nby the despotic German, serve as a model for similar assemblies\r\nthroughout the French provinces? Thus might provincial France be\r\ndelivered from the octopus of Paris.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic for “her Paris” as Mme. Adam has ever been, she\r\nnevertheless realises that the hereditary virtues of France are\r\nbest exemplified in the provinces. With the literary movement of\r\n“regionalism” initiated by Taine, continued by Mistral and Maurice\r\nBarrès, she has ever sympathised. Her own early novels are redolent\r\nwith the breath of her native Picardy, her later books with the spirit\r\nof that gay Provence which is the land of her adoption.\r\n\r\nWe in England, with our age-long experience of local government,\r\nare only too well aware of its drawbacks. But institutions work\r\ndifferently in different countries. And there is no doubt that the\r\nover-centralisation of French administration does aggravate the\r\nevils of bureaucracy. Of the multiplicity of petty officials Mme.\r\nAdam constantly complains in her _Souvenirs_. Would they be reduced\r\nif another of her favourite schemes were carried out? With René\r\nBazin,[399] with her dead hero Skobeleff,[400] and other conservative\r\nreformers, she would like to see parliamentary government replaced\r\nby an assembly elected separately by and representing the various\r\ninterests of the different classes, professions and trades throughout\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nFrom such an assembly Mme. Adam would not exclude women. All her life,\r\nfrom the days when she wrote her first book[401] to champion George\r\nSand and Daniel Stern, she has been an ardent feminist. In response\r\nto my inquiry as to whether she has in any way modified her feminist\r\nprinciples, she writes—\r\n\r\n                                             “_Callian Var_,\r\n                                                    “28.xi.16.\r\n\r\n     “No, I am no less feminist than in the beginning. I have merely\r\n     proved as editor for twenty years of an important review ...\r\n     that a woman may be something besides a housekeeper and a\r\n     _courtisan_.[402] I am not a suffragette, because I am an\r\n     anti-parliamentarian. I desire to see great professional councils,\r\n     of which, without any alteration in the law, women in France\r\n     may become members. We have women bankers, women farmers and\r\n     women traders. A great national council, composed not of the\r\n     favourites of the licensed victuallers, but of men chosen by\r\n     provincial councils and of exceptional women, would not present\r\n     the lamentable spectacle offered by the parliaments of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     “After the war we shall see so many widows, sonless mothers,\r\n     taking the places of those who are dead. Woman, alas! will have\r\n     paid dearly for the place to which she has a right, the place\r\n     which she occupied in the great school of Alexandria and during\r\n     the Renaissance.”\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous organisations with which Mme. Adam has associated\r\nherself since the war is that excellent movement _La Croisade des\r\nFemmes Françaises_, the object of which is to deny the calumnies\r\ncirculated by Germans against Frenchwomen, and intended to prove that\r\nthe typical woman of France is not, as Teutons have asserted, “a doll\r\nwithout morals, without heart, without courage, a creature of mere\r\ncoquetry, an instrument of perdition.” It was in the early months\r\nof the war that this crusade was initiated. Since then it has been\r\nrendered superfluous by the heroism, the endurance, the marvellous\r\nadaptability of our French sisters, which, eliciting the admiration of\r\nthe whole world, has proved them veritable queens of womanhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CASTLE OF VAVEY, RECENTLY CONVERTED INTO A HOME FOR\r\nPERMANENTLY DISABLED FRENCH SOLDIERS]\r\n\r\nMme. Adam herself, despite her eighty years, engages valiantly in\r\nwar work, toiling unceasingly in aid of those who have suffered from\r\nTeutonic violence. One of the works of mercy which is nearest to her\r\nheart is the voluntary effort she has initiated for the provision of\r\na home and sustenance for those warriors of France who have suffered\r\npermanent disablement in the defence of their country. For the\r\nhousing of these heroes Mme. Adam’s friend, le Comte de Rohan Chabot,\r\nhas placed at her disposal his beautiful château of Vavey, at St.\r\nJean-le-Vieux in the Department of Aisne. The fees Mme. Adam receives\r\nfor her numerous articles on the international situation, which are\r\nnow appearing throughout Europe, she consecrates to the prosecution\r\nof this good work, in which she is supported by the generals,\r\nwhom she is proud to call her _Fils d’Adoption_—General Nivelle,\r\nEx-Commander-in-Chief, General Lyautey, ex-Minister of War, General\r\nMarchand of Fashoda fame, Admiral Fournier, Commandant Viaud (Pierre\r\nLoti), and many others.\r\n\r\nPages would not suffice to describe all of Mme. Adam’s war activities.\r\nOne might note in passing her gratification when certain artillerymen\r\nof the 21st Army Corps serving at the front had the happy idea of\r\nchristening with her name, “Juliette Lamber,” one of their guns on\r\nthe spot where the first Frenchman was killed in the war. Many a\r\ndistinction has been conferred upon her in her long life. She has been\r\ngodmother to a newly observed star, a Paris street has been called by\r\nher name. But none of these honours has pleased her like this homage\r\nrendered to _la grande Française_ by a few brave gunners; not by the\r\nofficers, she is proud to remark, but by _les servants_, _les poilus_.\r\n\r\nMarvellous as are her activities, especially for a woman of her\r\nyears, it is even more by her spirit than by her deeds that Juliette\r\nAdam deserves well of her country. For forty-four years she has seen\r\nthis war coming—she foresaw even the route of the invading forces,\r\nmaintaining always that they would march through Belgium. She has\r\nrealised how German aggressiveness “was placing the peace of Europe at\r\nthe mercy of an incident.” But she has never for a moment doubted that\r\nwhen the struggle came _la patrie_ would be triumphant. With Gambetta\r\nshe has always believed that, however dark might be _la patrie’s_\r\nhorizon, the spirit of France could not be overcast for ever. For this\r\napostle of _l’idée française_ has never failed to read aright the\r\nhistory of her noble land, to behold in it the country of reawakenings\r\nand resurrections.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a family in France to which the war has not brought\r\nthe sorrow of bereavement. Mme. Adam’s family is no exception.\r\nLieutenant Madier, her youngest granddaughter’s husband, fell in the\r\nBattle of the Marne. He alone of all the officers of his battalion\r\nremained alive, when he was seriously wounded in the knee. Refusing\r\nto allow his men to bear him to a place of safety, he endeavoured to\r\nrise. “I am the only one left,” he cried. “Forward!” Barely had he\r\nuttered the word when a shell shattered the dwelling-place of this\r\nbrave spirit.\r\n\r\nDespite the unspeakable sufferings of France, despite her personal\r\nsorrows, she whom Gambetta used to call _Madame Intégrale_ has ever\r\nflouted the remotest suggestion of a premature peace. When some of the\r\nwomen of the allied countries consented to go to the Hague, there to\r\nconfer with the women of Germany, Mme. Adam addressed to them in the\r\ncolumns of the _Figaro_ a stern rebuke, explaining at the same time\r\nhow impossible it was for any Frenchwoman so much as to entertain the\r\nidea of taking part in such a conference. The heroic endurance, the\r\nunflinching faith of this stalwart woman animated the victors of the\r\nMarne, the defenders of Verdun. Now in this, the third year of the\r\nwar, she is convinced that ultimate triumph cannot long be delayed.\r\n“1917,” exclaims _la grande Française_, “’71 reversed. That blessed\r\ndate rings like the joy-bells of victory in my old veteran’s ears.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[388] _Souvenirs_, V. 159.\r\n\r\n[389] _Souvenirs_, V. 365.\r\n\r\n[390] _Ibid._, VII. 79.\r\n\r\n[391] _Salons et Journaux_ (1917).\r\n\r\n[392] _L’Entre-deux-Guerres_ (1915).\r\n\r\n[393]\r\nVol.   I.
