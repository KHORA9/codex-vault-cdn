He wishes the facts, and beyond all the\r\nfundamental facts, and when he has them his judgment is sure, quick and\r\nfinal. It is to men who think in this way that this book is addressed.\r\nIt is the story, told as concisely as the facts permit, of conditions\r\nas they truly exist in the great land which, like a cornucopia,\r\nstretches to the south of us. It is written for the business man of the\r\nUnited States, definitely, with such limitations as exist for such a\r\nbook--its value to the European may be the greater because it does not\r\nseek to straddle the national issue.\r\n\r\nI have written other books on Mexico. One has seen the light of\r\npublication before this volume was written.[1] I have sought, in\r\nthese other volumes, one upon the people of Mexico and one upon the\r\npsychology which governs their actions in social and in business life,\r\nto lay a solid ground for the understanding of the country and its\r\npeople. In the book which is offered here I give, freely, openly,\r\nwithout apology, the facts of a commercial situation which to me is\r\nthe most astounding condition in the business world to-day. I picture,\r\nwith the simplicity of truth, a country of vast natural mineral\r\nresources, but virtually no agricultural wealth, a country with almost\r\nno consuming population, a country of radical governments which have\r\nsought, frankly, to destroy capital and the machinery of Mexico’s own\r\nwealth. I have told but little of the famous resources of Mexico--those\r\nare described elaborately in many works. I have told little of the\r\nlabor of Mexico, for this is yet to be harnessed. I have described none\r\nof the great industrial needs of Mexico, because those are obvious to\r\nall who run.\r\n\r\nI have sought, rather, to set down those phases of Mexican life to-day\r\nwhich are the background of Mexican business. I have dared--what no\r\nman with less faith in the American business man would dare to do--to\r\nset forth honestly the truth about Mexicans of to-day, the secrets of\r\nMexican government, the facts of Mexican “bolshevism,” the horrors\r\nof Mexico’s degeneration under the rule of her predatory _caciques_.\r\nThese to me are the fundamentals of Mexican trade, just as they are the\r\nfundamentals of Mexican politics and of the life of the Mexican people\r\nto-day. I have sought to set them forth in their relation to the grave\r\nissues of world trade, to set them in their relationship with the ways\r\nof men in business and with the ways of business in its relationship\r\nto human life.\r\n\r\nI am a friend of Mexico. Few who have written of her life have been\r\nmore deeply interested in her welfare. I should like to lay here the\r\nfoundations for a solution of the Mexican business problem by setting\r\nforth the unhappy picture, ignoring no detail, seeking no self-deceit,\r\nas is too often the practice of those who write on Mexico. I believe\r\nthat more will be gained, more business of a solid sort won, by those\r\nwho realize and recognize the truth of conditions in Mexico, than by\r\nthose who deliberately close their eyes to those conditions.\r\n\r\nLet us have the truth, then! Let us face the Mexican trade problem\r\nas it is, with its vast potentialities balanced, as they actually\r\nare, by the sinister elements of ignorance, bitter poverty and racial\r\nconservatism. Let us see the problem while we see the golden goal. For\r\nthis problem is no mere issue of beating the British or the Germans to\r\na thriving market. It is an issue of bringing into being the purchasing\r\npower of a populous nation, which is bowed down to-day by the horrors\r\nof revolution, of unthinking radicalism, of national degeneracy. He\r\nwho shall solve that problem will win the trade of Mexico when she\r\nhas trade. That is all which is to be known, and the only issue to be\r\nfaced.\r\n\r\nThis book is not a radical document. It does not seek to explain the\r\nproblems of to-day in terms of to-morrow. The author finds in the\r\nradical movements of the present the leaven of the future--little else.\r\nHe sees in the upheavals of our day a searching for some essential\r\ntruth which will be a clarifying factor in this time of chaos and\r\ndistrust. He does not see in them the final solution of any of the\r\ndifficulties which hatched them out into a too ready world.\r\n\r\nNor is this book reactionary. The author believes that the day of\r\nDiaz is long past in Mexico, that the day of the dreamer of utopian\r\nvisions--Madero--is past in Mexico. He seeks in the present and in\r\nthe future the sane, firm grasp of actualities which to the watcher\r\non the tower is the only hope of true progress. He sees in the orgies\r\nof Carranza and his immediate successors not the upsurgence of mighty\r\nideals, but of personal ambitions and crass disregard of the bases of\r\nall human progress. He seeks, in the whirling chaos of the present, a\r\nfirm footing. He seeks to give the direction of such understanding as\r\nhe may have to those who think with him. He believes that if he gives\r\nsuch a direction to them, it will enable them to go forward to the\r\nwinning of some of the vast profits which await them in the Mexican\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nOne word more I would add. There rules to-day in Washington\r\na government one of whose mighty maxims is the protection and\r\nencouragement of those Americans who to-day go forth, as their fathers\r\nwent forth before them, to carve their way in the wilderness. The\r\nWashington government knows, as we all know, that the only wilderness\r\nleft to us is the open field of the vast undeveloped lands to the\r\nSouth. I believe that Washington plans definitely to support the\r\nAmerican pioneer to the fullest in his new conquest of the New World.\r\nThat his weapons of conquest are dollars and brains and energy matter\r\nnot, and that he battles in lands over which the flag shall never fly\r\nmatters less. The fact that he is an American, that he is honest, that\r\nhe is patriotic and sincere--these matter much in Washington.\r\n\r\nThis book, then, goes upon its way, its record clear and envisioned\r\nin deep frankness and in deep faith in the American business man and\r\nin the American government of to-day. I offer it to those who must go\r\nforth, to those who must perforce place the funds at the disposal of\r\nthose who go, and to those who, in the councils of our government, are\r\nquietly, without ostentation or political apology, placing firm hands\r\nto the backs of those who dare and who give.\r\n\r\n                                                       WALLACE THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n                                                         NEW YORK,\r\n                                                         August 5, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _The People of Mexico._ Harper & Bros., New York, 1921.

Excursions, however wet, will not change those\r\nfundamentals. Enthusiasm, however sincere, will not affect them. Above\r\nall, promises should not be taken into consideration in our cool\r\njudgment of them. American business men have never been noted for\r\nsentimentalism in their own country; they should not be sentimental in\r\nother countries. Let us take up the situation and look at it with the\r\nsane judgment we would apply to the question of selling, say, a new\r\ntype of water meter in New York City.\r\n\r\nThe three fundamentals of the Mexican trade question are not unique.\r\nThey are, first, the Market; second, the Credit, and third, the\r\nGovernment and Laws under which trade must be carried on. Truly not\r\noriginal, and the astonishing thing about American business men who\r\nconsider Mexico is that they apparently lose sight of them, and most of\r\nall lose sight of the emphasis which must be given to each.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Mexican market. Three phases again: the people, the\r\nindustries and the need. There are 15,000,000 people in Mexico.\r\nOf these, 6,000,000 are Indians, and Indians that are comparable,\r\nliterally, to our own reservation Indians in the United States, in\r\nthe things they buy and the things they make. There are 8,000,000\r\nmixed-bloods, a cross of Indian and Spanish, but of these 8,000,000\r\nfully 6,000,000 are almost as Indian as their full-blood cousins. In\r\nother words, 12,000,000 out of 15,000,000 take and need nothing from\r\nthe outside world excepting food, at those times, like the present,\r\nwhen they do not produce enough for their own needs. More than that,\r\nthe money or goods which would pay for imported food for the 12,000,000\r\nare created by the remaining 3,000,000--in other words, the actual\r\nmarket in Mexico is not 15,000,000 people but 3,000,000. The rest wear\r\nno shoes--only native tanned sandals. They wear no civilized clothes,\r\nonly white cotton woven at home. They wear only home-made hats, the raw\r\nmaterial the fiber of palm trees which grow wild. They have no need for\r\nculture, for houses, for travel. Remember, then, a buying population of\r\n3,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe industries are limited almost exclusively to the extraction of\r\nthe riches of the soil by mining and through deep oil wells. In all\r\nMexico, with its vast sweep of territory, virtually nothing is produced\r\nfor export excepting those riches which come from Mother Earth, and\r\nthose overwhelmingly under the enterprising management of the foreign\r\ncompanies and individuals who alone have ever sought to develop them.\r\nOnly one industry in Mexico puts human hands and human brains to the\r\nwheel of progress and creates wealth--that is the industry of growing\r\nsisal hemp in Yucatan. Sisal hemp is indispensable for the making of\r\nbinder twine for the world’s wheat crop, and is the basis of what was\r\nonce a great national and international industry. Yet to-day even\r\nthat commodity has been cut in production almost to the point of\r\ndestruction, by the machinations of Mexican government and graft, and\r\nYucatan is not to-day the great purchasing center that it once was.\r\nMoreover, Yucatan is far from the Mexican mainland, a principality, a\r\ncountry of its own, and its riches have never been a true part of the\r\nresources of Mexico, for it buys and sells direct with the outside\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nGold is the common medium of circulation in Mexico to-day. There is\r\nnot a peso of Mexican paper currency in use. All is gold, or foreign\r\nbills, with low-grade silver and copper as subsidiary coins. The use\r\nof gold is reassuring to the business man. It looks like prosperity\r\nand it does assure a firm rate of exchange. But the gold in Mexico\r\ndoes not mean these things. Its great significance is the absence of\r\ncredit. Gold circulates because no man trusts the government, and\r\nevery piece of gold that passes through your hands in Mexico tells you\r\nthat Mexico is far from being on a stable financial basis, either as a\r\ngovernment or as a business community. Gold is of value, really, only\r\nbecause it makes credit possible. When you must ship boxes of gold\r\ninto distant states at an appalling rate of insurance against bandits\r\nand highwaymen, it is not prosperity, but rather the lack of it. When\r\ngold is in circulation, and there are no bills, the available money\r\nof the country is limited, literally, to the total of the gold and to\r\nnot one cent more. When there is paper in circulation it means that\r\nthe gold supply has been increased many fold because the credit of the\r\ngovernment has been added to the gold to supplement the supply of money\r\nto be used in trade.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico there is not only no paper money, but there is practically no\r\ncommercial paper. The drafts of great foreign companies travel about\r\nthe land for weeks and months before they are cashed and when they\r\nfinally reach the bank on which they are drawn, the backs are covered\r\nwith endorsements, and on some an extra sheet of paper has been pasted\r\nto carry more signatures. And that is not good business, and should not\r\nbe reassuring to the prospective trader.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico to-day no one trusts the government, and as a result no one\r\ntrusts his neighbor. The business men of Mexico who are demanding\r\nlong-term credits abroad will not trust their oldest customers, and\r\ncannot themselves get credit in their own country. Recently, when\r\nthe Mexican government wanted credit on a large supply of railway\r\nequipment, it was told that if one young American, engaged in running\r\nprivate trains at heavy cost over the Mexican railway systems, would\r\nguarantee the bills, the Mexican government could have what it\r\nneeded. Otherwise, cash with order. The Mexican government is trying\r\nto get railway equipment, and is making promising announcements.\r\nBut it is getting very little, and for what it is getting it pays\r\nalmost entirely in cash, or, strangely enough in this age, barters\r\ncommodities or prepaid freight tickets for it! These are facts, and\r\nextremely significant facts. The railway equipment men want to know\r\nhow the government is going to pay--and that is what all Americans who\r\ncontemplate trade with Mexico should want to know.\r\n\r\nBut the need of Mexico, the power we have to help her rehabilitate\r\nherself! Ah, that is a strong bid, even with what we have called the\r\nunsentimental American business man. He wants to give her a lift now,\r\nwhen she needs it, and then he will not be forgotten when the big\r\nsplitting up of profits comes. Perhaps this is true. Let us look at\r\nit. For some years now we have been following the very laudable and\r\nbeautiful system of going more than half way with Mexico. We are still\r\nurged to follow this excellent method. The only trouble is that the\r\n“more than half way” is getting longer and longer, and Mexico is asking\r\nmore and more and giving less and less. The kindly souls who have\r\nsought to get into Mexico with their surplus stocks are not gaining\r\nanything, except curses and distrust. So far, save for the promises\r\nwhich have always been forthcoming, there is nothing coming out of\r\nMexico to help the trade we are hearing about.\r\n\r\nMost of the talk about Mexican trade for American manufacturers was\r\nborn, moreover, of our own need to get rid of accumulated goods.\r\nBeginning late in 1919, there was considerable inflow of these cheap\r\ngoods into Mexico on good terms. Those who were fortunate enough to\r\nunload talked of it, and the gossip went about that Mexico was a\r\nfine place to sell off extra stocks. But after a year, the unloading\r\nsystem began to glut the Mexican market, and to-day, when the same\r\nmanufacturers want to sell again, they find that Mexico will\r\ntake--only goods at sacrifice prices. They went half way and more, did\r\nour manufacturers, and Mexico did not “come back.” Instead she sat\r\ntight where we came to her, and insisted on our coming a little further\r\nwith concessions to her needs and wants. The result is that to-day\r\nthere is nothing like the demand for American goods that there was when\r\nwe first did the unloading which we thought would whet the Mexican\r\nappetite. Mexico is like the customer of a “fire sale” store--she will\r\nbuy only the most obvious bargains. It is cash trade for a section of\r\na town where there used to be credit, and where there is no credit\r\nto-day. But the customer is again demanding credit--and cash-trade\r\nbargains at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis question of credit is of necessity complicated. But perhaps the\r\nanswer as far as the American business man is concerned is contained\r\nin the fact that while the Mexican merchant demands credit he himself\r\ndoes not give credit--no country was ever on so thorough a cash basis\r\nas Mexico is to-day. The merchant who is asking for credit is carrying\r\non his business from hand to mouth; he has no accounts on his books to\r\nguarantee the goods for which he is promising to pay. He asks credit\r\non his character standing and on the possibilities of his market--he\r\noffers literally nothing else. Personally, many Mexicans and many\r\nforeigners in Mexico are reliable and honest men, but no sane business\r\nman would take in the United States risks similar to those demanded\r\nby his prospective customers in Mexico. And the possibilities of\r\nthe market--those are as yet thin air and enthusiastic hope, which\r\ngain strength only from our national need to get a foreign outlet to\r\nkeep our plants going. Let the American manufacturer weigh these two\r\nconsiderations with the additional realization that there is no reserve\r\ncredit in the background.\r\n\r\nReserve credit, such as bills payable, sound real estate values and\r\nprospects of peace and good business years ahead, are comparable to\r\nthe unseen sources of energy in the human body, on which that body\r\nlives and thrives during lean periods. Mexico’s lean period has now\r\nlasted for eleven long years, and in that period the country has been\r\nliving literally on its reserves alone. Again and again one hears the\r\nexpression, “Mexico is living on her fat,” and the continued marvel\r\nis that she has lived so long and survived such lengthened calamities\r\nthrough so many ghastly years of destruction. As this is written, there\r\nhas been some appearance of regeneration, a noisily announced period\r\nof “reconstruction.” But as yet this is only an appearance. Actually\r\nwhile the wheels of business and life are running more smoothly for the\r\nmoment, this is obviously a surface condition--deep down under the\r\nsurface of Mexican life the wasted tissue remains. Mexico is not yet\r\nfilling the interstices of her flesh with that reserve strength which\r\nis business credit and business promise.\r\n\r\nBut why not help in the rebuilding, and thus take a risk which will\r\nprobably bring great gain in the years of progress to come?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question must be based on a thorough understanding\r\nof the third of our three great issues--Mexican Government and Law as\r\napplied to business. The Mexican revolutions which began in 1910 had\r\nfor their announced object, “Mexico for the Mexicans.” The idea was to\r\nbring the foreigner under control of Mexican law and government. This\r\nwas eminently just--if it were true, as assumed, that under the Diaz\r\nrégime the foreigners had been above the Mexican law. The facts were\r\nlargely otherwise, however, despite some glaring abuses. In the working\r\nout of the idea of “Mexico for the Mexicans,” the revised as well as\r\nthe entirely new legislation and procedure went far beyond the normal\r\nreaction against the alleged irregularities of the Diaz time.\r\n\r\nIn the new “Constitution of 1917,” which is literally the most radical\r\nwritten constitution of any country in the world to-day, the chief, if\r\nnot the only object was to make difficult the operation of foreigners\r\nin any line of business in the country. The laws against their holding\r\nland are drastic and final in their import; no foreigner may own\r\nproperty within sixty miles of the border or within thirty miles of the\r\nsea; foreigners may not control a Mexican corporation formed for the\r\npurpose of holding such land unless they waive their citizenship rights\r\nwith respect to such companies; great estates are prohibited, so that\r\ntrue agricultural industry is made virtually impossible; foreign plans\r\nfor irrigation projects--the one hope of the Mexican farmer--are nipped\r\nand killed; most serious of all, such lands are virtually confiscated\r\nthrough nationalization projects which have already been applied to\r\nmany great properties, some of them of foreigners, and have been kept\r\nfrom affecting others only by active diplomatic protest.\r\n\r\nBut, the casual observer of things Mexican asks, how is it that\r\nbusiness still continues? How is it that the oil companies to whom,\r\nwe are told, these nationalization laws especially apply, how is it\r\nthat the oil companies are still doing business, are still drilling\r\nwells and taking out oil? Does this not mean that these laws are merely\r\nprovisions against a revival of the abuses of the old days? These are\r\nthe questions that occur, as the Mexicans planned them to occur, to the\r\noutside observer.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans assure us that this is truly the case, but the effect of\r\nthe laws is very different. Their effect is to place all business,\r\nMexican and American, foreign oil wells and native merchants alike, in\r\nthe status of receiving the _privilege_ of doing business, in place\r\nof the _right_ of doing business. In effect they make every foreigner\r\nin Mexico, from the missionaries who conduct services contrary to the\r\nlaw of the land which prohibits foreigners from officiating as priests\r\nbefore their own altars to the oil men who dig wells under permits\r\nwheedled out of a grasping government department, law-breakers or\r\nreceivers of special and “pernicious” privilege. To-day no business\r\nman can defend his rights before the courts of Mexico, for all rights,\r\neven the common rights of corporate business, are in some way or\r\nanother contradictory to the laws of the land. They receive privilege,\r\nand privilege in great and generous measure--if they are friendly to\r\nthe ruling group or their satellites. They receive privilege by the\r\ngrace of government, not rights by the power of government. Government\r\ntheoretically exists for the protection of the weak, but government in\r\nMexico exists actually for the exploitation of the strong by officials\r\nand for the suppression of the weak if the strong want and can pay for\r\nsuch suppression.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, the strong in Mexico are not altogether contented\r\nwith this condition. Somehow business, with its awakening consciousness\r\nto its helplessness, is finding the situation irksome. The greatest\r\nsingle industry in Mexico to-day is oil, and oil pays about $50,000,000\r\na year in various taxes to the Mexican government--and for what? Almost\r\nall of it for the privilege of doing business, and the result is that\r\noil is at the mercy, to-day, of government caprice and the caprice of\r\nMexican officials. The laws of the present era of Mexico are enacted\r\nliterally for the purpose of having a “club” of control over all forms\r\nof business activity, laws to be enforced when it is convenient, or to\r\nbe “forgotten” when that is desirable. The oil companies spend time\r\nand vast effort to keep their protests to the Washington and Mexican\r\ngovernments in good order--so that the price of their privileges may be\r\nkept low. The legitimate portion of their taxes is only about forty per\r\ncent of the total sum they pay, but it is probably literally true that\r\nthey would pay all they now pay and more if they could dispense with\r\nthe rule of privilege and trade it for decent human rights to do decent\r\nbusiness in a decently governed country.\r\n\r\nIn this, these companies are fighting the fight of the individual\r\nbusiness man as well as the fight of their own stockholders. It may all\r\nbe selfish, and doubtless is, but by a strange turn of affairs, the\r\nlaws of Mexico have worked out to the creation of salable privilege\r\ninstead of defensible rights, and this has thrown all business into\r\nthe same group. The business problem of Mexico is literally the\r\nachievement of this exchange of privileges for rights. And until that\r\nexchange is effected, he is but a gambler who goes into Mexico to seek\r\nor to offer honest business, for even though he should gain much sure\r\nprofit in the beginning, those profits will be more than wiped out\r\nlater unless the legitimate business of Mexico is given the legitimate\r\nrights of business.\r\n\r\nAnd how is this exchange of privileges for rights to be effected? This\r\nis the problem that confronts American business and American government\r\nto-day. The issue is joined clean and is simple indeed. The provisions\r\nof the Mexican Constitution of 1917 and the laws which give it effect\r\nremain on the Mexican statute books to-day because they are profitable\r\nto the group in control of the government. They mean, literally, graft\r\nand power, for where privilege is necessary for the carrying out of\r\nbusiness, there is a price on privilege, but where rights are provided\r\nfor business, the price and the prize are upon industry and activity.\r\n\r\nTo the members of the American Chambers of Commerce on tour in Mexico,\r\nto the American manufacturers who are invited to ship goods to Mexico\r\nto-day, offers of privilege are made, privilege without graft or\r\nprice, now. But the price is there, and is clearly worked out in the\r\nsubtle Mexican mind. These American business men, pleased with their\r\nreception, are to become boosters of the Mexican government, demanding\r\nits recognition and scouting the great financial interests who are\r\ntheir traditional enemies at home. That is price enough to the Mexican\r\nmind. But when recognition is gained, and when those same individuals\r\nseek to do business in Mexico under “normal” conditions, the laws\r\nwhich ensconce privilege and give it into the hands of petty and high\r\nofficials for dispensation, will reap their toll.\r\n\r\nOne way only remains--the removal of privilege, the establishment\r\nof rights. Insistence on these issues alone will almost solve the\r\nMexican problems politically and commercially. But the Mexicans are\r\nwise indeed when they seek to divide the counsels of this country, to\r\nplace the small American business man and manufacturer in a position of\r\nantagonism to the issues that are set clear in Washington, the issues\r\nof political privilege versus political rights, the issues of the\r\nbusiness privileges which those individual Americans seek to gain for\r\nthemselves versus the business rights that will include them and all\r\ntheir fellows.\r\n\r\nThe call is again for clear foresight and not for sentimentalism, for\r\na social conception of business and not for a selfish, individualistic\r\nhope of getting in ahead of the next fellow. The Americans who have\r\nbeen longest in Mexico are begging to-day for rights in exchange for\r\nprivilege. They know, as those who look upon Mexico from outside or as\r\nnewcomers do not know, that until Mexico mends her ways with business,\r\nbusiness can never rescue Mexico from the slough of her present\r\nunhappiness. They know that no business in any nation can long prosper\r\nwithout the prosperity and the good sense of the government of that\r\nnation. They are not pirates, and they know that piracy, in government\r\nor in business, leads but to the destruction of both. What they know we\r\nmay have for the listening. If we do not take it, we, too, must learn,\r\nas they learned, in the costly school of experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                   NATURE AND THE MEXICAN MARKET[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery land upon this globe owes to nature that predetermination of its\r\nproducts and its needs which are the vital factors of its commerce and\r\nits industries. Even the nature of its races, which has so much to do\r\nwith the standards of living which affect the quality and volume of\r\nbusiness, is determined to a certain extent by climate and geography.\r\nIt is therefore a fundamental need of all who have a deep interest in\r\nMexican business to grasp something of the location, the formation, and\r\nthe climate of that country. For few nations in the world have a more\r\nwonderful location, and few have a more disastrous climate.\r\n\r\nThe vast cornucopia-like triangle of land which comprises the territory\r\nof Mexico lies south of nearly three-quarters of the southern boundary\r\nof the United States. Its western tip touches Southern California at\r\nthe Pacific and its most easterly point is 500 miles south of the\r\nPensacola, at the western end of Florida. For 1,833 miles Mexico’s\r\nnorthern border is contiguous to the United States, 693 miles eastward\r\nalong arbitrarily marked lines from the Pacific Ocean to El Paso,\r\nTexas, and the remainder southeastward along the sinuous course of the\r\nRio Grande to the Gulf of Mexico. Its jagged southern border is hardly\r\n400 miles long, touching Guatemala and British Honduras (Belize).\r\n\r\nThis cornucopia, grasping the Gulf of Mexico on the east like a great\r\nhand, swings southeastward from the Pacific contact with the United\r\nStates until the most westerly point of the Guatemalan border is 500\r\nmiles _east_ of Mexico’s easternmost contact with the United States on\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nSet apart, as Mexico is by her boundaries, she seems in form much like\r\na great peninsula, but she has, herself, two important peninsulas as\r\npart of her territorial extent and configuration. One is the Peninsula\r\nof Yucatan, which forms the eastern end of the cornucopia, the thumb\r\nof the curving hand which grasps the Gulf of Mexico, an area of about\r\n50,000 square miles. The other is the long, narrow peninsula of Lower\r\nCalifornia, with 58,343 square miles, extending directly south of the\r\nAmerican state of California and connected with the Mexican mainland by\r\nonly a narrow strip.\r\n\r\nThat mainland comprises, with the two peninsulas, 765,762 square\r\nmiles, and the 1,561 square miles of coastal islands under Mexican\r\nsovereignty bring the total area of the country up to 767,323 square\r\nmiles. The greatest width of the mainland is 750 miles, and the\r\ngreatest length is 1,942 miles, from the northwestern tip of Lower\r\nCalifornia, where it joins the United States, to the southernmost point\r\nin the jagged Guatemalan border in the Mexican state of Chiapas. The\r\nnarrowest point in Mexico is 120 miles, at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,\r\nonce discussed as the possible site of an interoceanic canal, and in\r\nthe time of Diaz the route of a great transshipping railway between the\r\nPacific and the Gulf of Mexico. The Atlantic (Gulf of Mexico) coastline\r\nof Mexico is 1,727 miles long, that of the Pacific (including the long\r\nborder of Lower California) 4,574 miles.\r\n\r\nLying between 32° 30′ and 14° 30′ North Latitude and 86° 30′ to 117°\r\nLongitude west from Greenwich, the triangular form of the Mexican\r\nterritory places it about equally in the temperate and torrid zones.\r\nThis is a primary factor in Mexican climate, but far more significant\r\nis the contour of the country itself.\r\n\r\nThis is largely mountainous, for if we include the high but fertile\r\ntable-lands, nearly two-thirds of the country is covered with mountain\r\nranges. The Rocky Mountains of the United States, the great backbone of\r\nthe Western Hemisphere, cross the Mexican border into Sonora, in a low,\r\nnarrow range. Almost immediately south of the international line they\r\nbegin spreading eastward. A long, slowly rising valley a hundred miles\r\nwide continues southward from El Paso, narrowing rapidly, while to the\r\neastward of this valley rises an apparently new range of mountains,\r\nobviously a part of the great Rocky Mountain range, but unconnected\r\nwith it in the United States and south, indeed, of the broad flat\r\nplains of Texas. This is the _Sierra Madre Oriental_, or Eastern Mother\r\nRange, the continuation of the Rockies in Sonora and Durango being\r\ncalled the _Sierra Madre Occidental_, or Western Mother Range. Further\r\nsouth, these two join together, and spread to virtually the whole width\r\nof Mexico, excepting for the Gulf coastal plain, some 300 miles wide,\r\nto the east. All of Central Mexico is mountainous, flattened only by\r\nvast plateaus which, according to the accepted geological theory, were\r\ncreated by alluvial deposits and lava dust from the mountains which\r\nrise still above them. At the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Sierra Madre\r\nflattens out till, save for the relatively easy grades which climb from\r\nthe Gulf and from the Pacific to the summit of the low divide (less\r\nthan 300 feet above sea level) the mountains might be all but gone. The\r\nnarrow plane of the Isthmus passed, the mountains rise again until the\r\ncenter of the state of Chiapas is once more a vast plateau accented\r\nwith towering peaks, a formation which continues southward through\r\nCentral America, lowers again at Panama, but joins directly, at last,\r\nwith the South American Andes.\r\n\r\nIn this sweep of mountainous territory are hundreds of deep cañons or\r\n_barrancas_, great fertile plateaus, and many wonderful mountains.\r\nOf these last those about the Valley of Anahuac, the site of Mexico\r\nCity and for ages the center of Mexican government and population, are\r\nthe most famous. Here are Popocatepetl (17,520 feet) and Ixtaccihuatl\r\n(16,960 feet) the snow-peaked volcanoes, and to the eastward the still\r\nmore beautiful cone of Orizaba (18,250 feet). Virtually at the same\r\nlatitude, but far to the west, is Colima, (12,991 feet), a still active\r\nvolcano. Toluca (14,950 feet), close to the Valley of Mexico, Malinche\r\n(14,636 feet) in the state Tlaxcala, the Cofre de Perote (13,400 feet)\r\nin the state of Vera Cruz, and Tancitaro (12,664 feet) are those of\r\ngreatest height. Only the already great altitude of the plateaus\r\nof Mexico from which most of the striking mountains spring keeps\r\nhundreds of others from filling the eye of the traveler. The scenery\r\nwhich results from the mountainous formations of Mexico is literally\r\nunsurpassed, for Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl can give the climber all\r\nthe thrills of the Alps, and the crater lakes to be found in one or two\r\nsections of Mexico rival in splendor the more famous resorts in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe deep and wide _barrancas_ which mark the mountainous formation all\r\nthrough Mexico are magnificent to contemplate, but the day’s journey\r\ndown and up the sides of such a geological spectacle as the Barranca\r\nof Beltran brings home to even the unscientific observer the terrific\r\nhandicaps which these vast cuts put upon the industrial development of\r\nthe country. Much of the conquering of these handicaps was achieved\r\nunder the broad railway policy of President Diaz, and the work done\r\nstill remains, but many years must now pass before the final conquest\r\nis achieved. Such a work as the building of the Colima branch of\r\nthe Mexican Central, completing the only direct line for the first\r\ntime from the Capital to the Pacific, will hardly be repeated when\r\nrevolution threatens, for here, in less than 100 miles, twenty great\r\nbridges had to be built, most of them crossing _barrancas_ and cuts of\r\nmere geological formation, with virtually no streams filling them even\r\nin the rainy season. The Southern Pacific line from the northern border\r\nin Sonora lacks but sixty miles of linking up with the Guadalajara\r\nbranch of the National Railways, but thirty of those sixty miles are\r\nthrough a mountainous territory cut with deep _barrancas_ which will\r\ncost close to a million dollars a mile to build.\r\n\r\nSuch _barrancas_ and valleys do not, of themselves, indicate either\r\ngreat natural water power or navigable streams. There are wonderful\r\nwater power possibilities in Mexico, to be sure, which come from two\r\nfactors, the sheer drops which give ideal power sites with tremendous\r\nheads of water, and the heavy torrential rainy season. But the streams\r\nthemselves do not carry sufficient water the year round to justify any\r\nplant, and tremendous reservoir development is vital to any power plant\r\ndesign. Such reservoirs have been built in various parts of Mexico,\r\nbut at appalling expense, such as only great financial interests can\r\nswing--only foreign capital or the government has been able to handle\r\nthem. There is an added and unexpected element of difficulty--the\r\nporousness of much of the soil of Mexico. The mountains, indeed, are of\r\nigneous rocks, but underneath the valleys is often soft limestone, and\r\nmore often still, under those places where a great impounding of water\r\nmight be made with a relatively low and inexpensive dam, is the soft,\r\nporous alluvial and volcanic-ash land with which the valleys have been\r\nfilled up.\r\n\r\nThis porous soil and limestone are factors bearing on the absence of\r\nnavigable streams. Even in the lowlands the streams run underground in\r\nMexico, and while they can be tapped by shallow wells, they deprive\r\nMexico almost entirely of the advantages of river transportation. Even\r\nthe Rio Grande, on the northern border, is useless for navigation most\r\nof the year. The Panuco, at whose mouth is located the great oil center\r\nof Tampico, is navigable only a short distance above that port. The\r\nbroad, rich coastal plain along the Gulf of Mexico is watered by tiny\r\nstreams, all of which, excepting the partially navigable Papaloapam,\r\nare useless for steamers and even for launches most of the year. Not\r\nuntil we reach the Isthmus of Tehuantepec do we find a river worth\r\nconsidering for transportation. The Coatzacoalcos, at whose mouth\r\non the Gulf of Mexico is Puerto Mexico (the eastern terminus of the\r\nTehuantepec National Railway), furnishes a highway which made possible\r\nthe relatively great development of American tropical plantations\r\nduring the years of peace under Diaz. Its mouth was then the port of\r\nloading for great ships, but only by continual dredging was it kept\r\nopen, and to-day the port is abandoned except for light-draft coasting\r\nships. Further south, emptying into the Gulf at Frontera, is the\r\nmagnificent system of which the Grijalva and the Usumacinta are the\r\nchief streams. Here indeed have plied and in the future will ply great\r\nriver steamers, for upon the banks of the Usumacinta, at least, are\r\nrich oil fields and the fairest farming land in all tropical Mexico.\r\nBoth the Grijalva and the Usumacinta are magnificent streams, and\r\nthe latter is comparable, in its majestic volume, to the Mississippi\r\nitself. Only the bar at Frontera keeps them from being navigable to\r\nocean steamers. For a brief period under President Madero this bar\r\nwas dredged so that fruit boats could enter and go to the docks of\r\nbanana farms, encouraging a promising industry which was killed by\r\nheavy taxation and government neglect of the dredging, under the\r\nrevolutionary presidents of recent years. But this one system of rivers\r\noffers virtually all there is of navigation in Mexico.\r\n\r\nYucatan, the peninsula which separates the Caribbean sea from the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, is virtually without rivers, the water from the abundant\r\nrainfall of its interior finding its way to underground streams in the\r\nporous underlying coral limestone.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast there are a few rivers. The most important is\r\nthe Lerma, which waters a large territory on the Pacific side of\r\nthe continental divide, and allows some local transportation. The\r\nBalsas, in the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, reaches far inland, but\r\nrapids and shallows make its use for navigation expensive and all but\r\nimpossible. In Sonora is the Yaqui river, navigable for small boats and\r\nof some value for transportation. The Fuerte is also in this class.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of the geography of Mexico which affects transportation\r\nis the complete absence of good natural harbors well located.\r\nThe chief port of Mexico, Vera Cruz, has a harbor which was built\r\nartificially around a partially protected bay. Tampico is a port solely\r\nbecause of the jetties which narrow the mouth of the Panuco and, with\r\nthe help of dredges, keep the channel clear. Puerto Mexico has a\r\nsimilar problem, but the smaller river makes dredging absolutely vital.\r\nFrontera is solely a dredging proposition, as the Usumacinta and the\r\nGrijalva, emptying together into the Gulf, have formed a vast delta in\r\nthe lowlands which can probably never be narrowed to take advantage of\r\nthe great volume of water which they pour out. Yucatan has literally\r\nno semblance of a harbor, and its great crops of sisal hemp are loaded\r\nfrom lighters at appalling expense.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific coast, Acapulco has one of the ideal harbors of the\r\nworld, completely landlocked, and open for medium-draft ships. But it\r\nis relatively small, and moreover as yet almost inaccessible to any\r\nrailway survey, although it was used by the galleons from Manila as a\r\nport for trans-shipment of the treasures of the Orient across Mexico\r\nto the galleons from Cadiz which came to Vera Cruz. Salina Cruz, the\r\nPacific terminus of the Tehuantepec National Railway, was built from\r\nan open roadstead with two lines of jetties and seawalls, a work which\r\ninattention has now all but ruined. Manzanillo, the terminus of the\r\nonly direct railway line from Mexico City to the Pacific, was also\r\nbuilt with seawalls and opened by dredges. Mazatlan, further up the\r\ncoast, and the chief port of the Southern Pacific Railway of Mexico,\r\nis an open roadstead. Guaymas, the port of the state of Sonora, is\r\naccessible only to light-draft ships.\r\n\r\nThese are all great natural handicaps, and have affected the life of\r\nMexico probably more than it will be possible to estimate. The mighty\r\nand costly work of the Diaz régime in building harbors is a monument\r\nto that “materialistic” era which will last through many years and has\r\nalready played a tremendous part in furnishing the sinews of revolution\r\nto succeeding governments, for without that work Mexico would be far\r\nfrom capable of sustaining herself in the period of her agony to-day.\r\n\r\nBut beyond all these factors of mountains and rivers and sea looms\r\na yet greater problem, and still more far-reaching--the problem of\r\nclimate. As noted, Mexico lies in about equal parts in the temperate\r\nand torrid zones. But the geological zones are far more important, for\r\nclimate is affected not alone by latitude but by altitude as well.\r\nThese geological zones are three, the hot country or _tierra caliente_,\r\nthe temperate country or _tierra templada_ and the (relatively) cold\r\ncountry or _tierra fria_. The hot country is the lowland section\r\nalong the coasts from sea level to 3,000 feet altitude, where the mean\r\nannual temperature varies from 76° to 88° Fahrenheit. The Mexican\r\nterminology includes not only the lowlands of the torrid zone, but the\r\nwhole coastal plain up to the northern border. The _tierra templada_\r\nlies along the mountain slopes and in the lower plateaus, between 3,000\r\nand 6,500 feet altitude, where the temperature is between 65° and 76°.\r\nThis zone takes in the higher northern sections which are within the\r\ntemperate zone proper. The _tierra fria_ takes in the high plateaus\r\nand the mountains, between 6,500 and 12,500 feet, the yearly average\r\ntemperatures varying from 30° to 60°, although the important sections\r\nrecord 50° or more. The three geological zones each include about equal\r\nportions of the country, but half of the inhabitants live in the cold\r\nzone, and only a quarter each in the temperate and hot sections. The\r\nmean temperatures of the cold zone are approximately those recognized\r\nas the most favorable for physical exertion, but in the hot country the\r\nbody struggles against a handicap of almost 20° F. more than the 65°\r\nat which it normally functions best. More significant still are the\r\ntemperatures of all the zones in their relation to mental activity.\r\nThe human mind is at its best under the stimulus of a mean temperature\r\nof about 40° F., but even at Mexico City, 7,600 feet above sea level,\r\nthe mean temperature of winter is as high as 53°. In the temperate and\r\nhot countries the handicaps under which the brain functions run to 20°\r\nand up to 45° above the 40° at which the human mind works at highest\r\nefficiency. No stimulating winters, no clarifying cool spells, even, in\r\nthe midst of the endlessly beautiful summers of Mexico!\r\n\r\nOnly the cold zone has any advantages in temperature, and these\r\nadvantages are equally important with the fertility of the soil in\r\naccounting for the predominance of population there. Yet even where\r\nthe temperature is favorable to at least physical work, there is the\r\ndebilitating sameness of the tropics, the assurance that there will\r\nalways be more difference between day and night than between the\r\nseasons. There, on the heights, too, the nervous drain of altitude\r\nand of lack of moisture in the air takes the place--with no advantage\r\nto the human machine--of the humidity and heat of the hot country. At\r\nevery turn in Mexico climate takes toll of human energy, even if we\r\nignore the undoubtedly debilitating effect of tropical and sub-tropical\r\nlight upon the white men and upon their mixed-blood descendants as well.\r\n\r\nAll these climatic factors, then, have continuous influence on the\r\nhealth of all the Mexican people as well as upon Mexican business. The\r\nhot, humid weather of the hot country makes those who live there low\r\nin resistance of disease, while the nervous strain of the altitudes and\r\ndryness of air in the better portions achieves a not dissimilar result\r\nin lowering resistance. It is axiomatic that the Mexicans as a people\r\nare seldom well and, as has been recorded in detail elsewhere,[3]\r\nthis ill-health has been and is to-day one of the determinants of the\r\nrelatively low state of progress of the country. No people who are\r\ncontinually sick and upon whose energies their climate is a continuous\r\ndrain can work well or achieve greatly.\r\n\r\nThe relation of this thoroughly recognized factor of ill-health to\r\nMexican trade and commerce must not be overlooked. It is at the root\r\nof much of the apathy which keeps the Mexican people at their low\r\nebb of business enterprise. It determines with peculiar insistence\r\ntheir predilection for the easy road, the “_mañana_ habit,” even for\r\nthe dominance of outworn traditional methods in agriculture and in\r\nbusiness. It has a great deal to do with the ease with which foreigners\r\ndevelop a land which has for centuries lain virtually fallow. But it\r\nplaces vast difficulties in the way of that development, for it keeps\r\nthe labor problem continually in the foreground and vitiates much of\r\nthe great advantage which the relative cheapness of that labor seems to\r\noffer. It has and will continue to have a powerful effect on trade,\r\nfor it keeps even the enterprising among Mexican business men at a low\r\nstandard of efficiency and makes it almost imperative that foreigners,\r\nfor the present, do most of the jobbing and export and much of the\r\nretail trade and export buying of the country. This element is too\r\nlikely to be lost sight of, because it is not a condition common to\r\nother lands. But it explains much that seems at first inexplicable in\r\nthe difficulties of the American exporter and importer in getting the\r\nadequate representation in Mexico which he must have.\r\n\r\nAnother vitally important effect of Mexican geography is the\r\nuncertainty and untoward distribution of rainfall. This has forced\r\nupon the Mexicans their diet of corn and with it their use of fiery\r\ncondiments which are probable causes of the digestive disorders which\r\nravage all classes. Moreover, the rainfall conditions have been vitally\r\nimportant in the determination of the entire agricultural tendency of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe seasons in Mexico are marked, not by winter cold and summer heat so\r\nmuch as by seasons of rain and drought. The winter is the dry season,\r\nroughly between October and May, and the summer is the salubrious rainy\r\nseason, from June to September. The distribution of rain throughout\r\nthe year and the failure of the rains in the important growing seasons\r\nin some of the otherwise fertile sections is due primarily to the\r\ngeography of the country. Professor Ellsworth Huntington, of Yale, the\r\ngreat American climatologist, finds that Mexico’s summer rains are due\r\nto the vertical rays of the sun which cause the rapid rising of the\r\nheated air, with sudden expansion and condensation, first over the\r\nlow-lying hot country and later on the rising uplands of the _tierra\r\ntemplada_, where the function of the mountains in bringing about\r\ncondensation is amply proven by the well-watered eastern slopes and the\r\ndry western sides of the ranges.\r\n\r\nThis mountain contour and the peculiar shape of the Mexican mainland\r\n(very wide at the north in proportion to the south) create another\r\nimportant climatological effect--the broad stretches of desert in the\r\nnorthern sections. The so-called continental type of climate which\r\nforms the American deserts further north combines with the mountain\r\ncontour and the distance from the eastern seashore (driving the\r\nrain-clouds southward) to make immense sections of Mexico desert,\r\ncapable of supporting, at best, only wandering herds. These deserts\r\nlie between the broad arms of the great “Y” of the Mexican mountain\r\nranges, and combined with the mountainsides themselves render nearly\r\nthree-fourths of the area of Mexico unfit for cultivation, even if\r\nirrigation were general.\r\n\r\nThe result is that of the 500,000,000 acres of land in Mexico, not\r\nmore than 25,000,000 acres are arable. Great sections are useless, so\r\nthat in the state of Chihuahua, 90,000 square miles in extent, only\r\nabout 125,000 acres, or less than two-tenths of one per cent can be\r\ncultivated--and most of that arable portion is irrigated.\r\n\r\nThe most fertile sections of Mexico are rich indeed, and in the plateau\r\nvalleys, where alluvial deposits and lava dust have been poured in\r\ntogether to form the soil, great crops can be raised--when there is\r\nrain. Only in a relatively limited section, however, is rain sure to\r\ncome at the times needed by the crops. Often when it does come, it is\r\nin torrential downpours which are likely to wash cultivated fields\r\naway in a single night. It is this condition which makes the so-called\r\n_tierra templada_, on the slopes of the mountains, in many ways the\r\nleast desirable of all the farming land of Mexico.\r\n\r\nUncertainty of rainfall is, then, one of the outstanding results of the\r\nMexican climate as influenced by Mexican geography. This uncertainty\r\nworks forever upon the mind of the Mexican farmer, making him a\r\nhopeless fatalist, making it less than worth his while to attempt\r\nscientific cultivation. If there is rain, his crops are good anyway,\r\nand if there is not rain, the cost of labor and fertilizer and good\r\nseed are lost. The Mexican farmer is the worst of gamblers, and his\r\nfondest hope is that his average crop over a period of years will be\r\ntwenty-five per cent of normal!\r\n\r\nFamine has ravaged Mexico periodically for thousands of years. It is\r\nmost interesting, in looking at the present stage (when the largest\r\nitems of import are foodstuffs), to realize that it has probably been\r\nonly the much-abused hacienda system which has saved Mexico from severe\r\nravages of recent famine. The hacienda system, which is the operation\r\nof huge estates under an elaborate overseership, approaches as nearly\r\nas the living conditions of the country permit to a businesslike\r\nadministration of the farming of the land. It was the stable factor in\r\nMexican food production in the time of the Spaniards and in the later\r\nera of Diaz.\r\n\r\nThe small farmer of Mexico has worked, since the beginning of Indian\r\nhistory, without a thought of supplying the market and thus feeding\r\nthe industrial workers of the towns. He has lived from hand to mouth,\r\nand only when he chances to have a surplus does he transport it or\r\nsell it on the ground for the needs of the city market. So true is\r\nthis that in the period of mining and industrial expansion under Diaz,\r\nthe draining of the labor from the haciendas to the mines and to the\r\nfew factories had an immediate effect on the food production, and the\r\nimports of foreign corn and wheat grew almost in exact proportion\r\nto the diversion of this labor to industry. The small farmers, the\r\nIndians and peons, who had places of their own or worked in the village\r\ncommons, did not go to the mines, but continued their relatively easy\r\nexistence on their own little _fincas_. They learned only slowly the\r\npossibilities of the increased market for their product, and only to an\r\ninfinitesimal degree did they rise to meet that market.\r\n\r\nTo-day, with the shutting down of hundreds of the haciendas, and the\r\nreturn of the country to its primeval agriculture, the situation has\r\nbecome extremely serious, and the food importations have grown out of\r\nall proportion to the industrial growth of the country; in fact, almost\r\nin inverse ratio to the industrial depression of the country.\r\n\r\nThis presents a serious problem, but it also presents a promise of\r\nnew opportunity when peace comes to Mexico. For then there must come\r\na revival of large-scale farming, the growth of a new farming system,\r\nand with it a tremendously increased market for modern farm implements.\r\nThere has been much talk, on the part of the revolutionary governments,\r\nof the needs of the new small farmers for agricultural machinery,\r\nbut this is almost entirely talk, for the new small farmers are only\r\nfalling back to the way of their ancestors, and are not in any sense\r\ntaking the place of the ruined haciendas in food production for the\r\ncities and industrial sections. That development will probably come in\r\nthe form of an entirely new system of agriculture, in which foreign\r\nmachinery and of necessity foreign capital must have a vital part.\r\n\r\nOne of the inevitable developments of Mexican agriculture must be\r\nin the direction of irrigation. There is literally not enough good\r\naccessible land which will produce without irrigation to feed the\r\ncountry or, what is more important, to make an increase of population\r\npossible. This land must be created by irrigation, and irrigation,\r\nowing to the geographical formation of the country, must of necessity\r\nbe carried out by great capital. Many of the village communes have\r\nirrigation systems, of a crude sort. Water is brought from distant\r\nstreams, where it flows after the rainy season, and in some places\r\nit is brought up from the underground streams by means of crude\r\nwater-wheels operated by man-power. But the total area watered by such\r\nirrigation is relatively insignificant, and as dams can be built in\r\nMexico only at large cost, the true development of Mexican irrigation\r\nwaits on peace, on foreign capital and government investment and\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nSomething of this sort had been begun before the present era of\r\nrevolutions. In the closing years of the Diaz régime (before 1911)\r\nmany franchises were granted to large private companies which planned\r\nirrigation projects, and the sum of 90,000,000 pesos was ordered\r\nexpended on government irrigation over a period of years. A few of\r\nthe private companies had put their plans into execution, and many\r\nothers, on the way to accomplishment, were nipped and destroyed by the\r\nsubsequent revolutions. For the past ten years, nothing has been done\r\ntoward solving the problems of irrigating the fertile but unwatered\r\nlands of Mexico, and it seems hardly likely that anything will be\r\ndone under the threats of confiscation which now hang over all great\r\nenterprise there.\r\n\r\nRainfall conditions have had much to do with the overemphasis on the\r\nland problem and indeed with the failure of succeeding governments\r\nto solve that problem. As in all arid countries, water rights were\r\noriginally more important to the natives than were land rights. In\r\nhundreds of the Indian communes which still persist, the communal\r\nrights of the Indians are distributed, not on the basis of land\r\nassigned, but of the water allowed; each Indian receives a proportion\r\nof the water brought by the communal irrigation ditches, and may\r\ntake three or four times the amount of land which his water will\r\nirrigate--for crop rotation, forage, etc. This inevitable emphasis\r\non water has perhaps had its part in directing the attention of the\r\nIndians in their demands for land distribution, toward the cultivated\r\nhaciendas where water is available. But it also gives promise for\r\na future which will make possible the rehabilitation of the country\r\nthrough great irrigation projects creating thousands of rich small\r\ntracts available for distribution to industrious natives--and foreign\r\nsmall farmers as well. In the government franchises given under Diaz to\r\nprivate irrigation projects, provision was made that about one-third\r\nof the land brought into cultivation should be turned over to the\r\ngovernment for distribution to small native farmers.\r\n\r\nAside from the indirect effect of these rainfall conditions, they\r\nhave determined, with imperative insistence, the type of agriculture\r\nwhich is followed in Mexico, and so have affected her trade in foods\r\nand raw materials. They have made corn (maize) the staple food of the\r\ncountry, as wheat is the staple of the lands where there is winter\r\nsnow and regular rainfall throughout the year. They have allowed the\r\ndevelopment of only the tropical products like coffee, sugar and rubber\r\nin the rich districts of Vera Cruz and Oaxaca which were partially\r\nopened by foreign stock companies under Diaz. They have, more than\r\nall, enthroned, as the only important agricultural export of Mexico,\r\nthe sisal hemp of Yucatan. This desert product, which requires slow\r\ngrowth for the maturing of the long stout fibers which make rope and\r\nbinder twine, is the greatest export of Mexico which is the product\r\nof Nature’s bounty and human enterprise. Coffee and some rubber and\r\ntobacco and a little sugar were raised for export in happier days,\r\nbut only sisal hemp, the product of the desert _henequen_ plant, has\r\nbecome a wealth-producer in any great quantity. Mexico has long been\r\nan importer of foodstuffs, for, as I have noted, before the days of\r\nmodern commerce, famine came with terrible regularity. Under Diaz, food\r\nwas imported in increasing quantities, and since his fall, Mexico has\r\nbeen utterly dependent on the outside world for a large portion of the\r\nnutriment of her people.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible now to predict when and how Mexico will become an\r\nagricultural country in fact as well as in potentialities. Irrigation\r\nmust come, for only when it does will agriculture and the prosperity\r\nof agriculture fill the land. In one section where irrigation has\r\nbeen carried out on a large scale--the Laguna district near Torreon,\r\nCoah.--cotton is grown in quantity. This product feeds into the native\r\nindustry of cotton weaving which flourishes near Orizaba and in other\r\nsections where local, direct water-power is available.\r\n\r\nIt seems inevitable that the increase in irrigated lands will add\r\nto the acreage of cotton and also to the number and importance of\r\nagricultural products of the class of raw materials. The country\r\nwhich irrigation will water in Mexico is of vast extent, and is\r\nsafely comparable, even at its worst, with what the lands of Utah\r\nand California and the Imperial Valley were before water was brought\r\nto them. Again, however, we wait on peace and on the great works of\r\nmodern scientific irrigation. And, however enthusiastic we may be as\r\ntradesmen, our capital will not be rushing to seek Mexican investments\r\nof this sort until civilized government again rules, with a promise of\r\nrelative permanency.\r\n\r\nThe desert character of the country in the north was responsible for\r\nthe establishment of a great cattle-raising industry, for the land was\r\ncheap and the ranges were vast. This has to-day been virtually wiped\r\nout, and Mexico imports meat from the United States--all the result of\r\nrevolution, so that when peace comes the cattle industry will surely\r\nbe revived. But always the cattle of northern Mexico have been of the\r\nrange, still unfit for profitable slaughter, and sections suitable for\r\ntheir fattening have been badly needed. There was, in other days, much\r\nshipment of range cattle into the United States, and to the better\r\nwatered southern sections of Mexico. But although peace will bring a\r\nrevival of the ranges, Mexico cannot look forward to becoming a great\r\nmeat-producing country until the irrigation problem is solved.\r\n\r\nThere are rich, well-watered sections of Mexico--this must not be\r\noverlooked--but these have resulted in a crowding of population on\r\nthe plateaus and through the rich valleys such as that of the Lerma\r\nriver in Jalisco state, and have contributed but little toward the\r\nbroad development of the country. In fact, one of the characteristics\r\nof Mexico’s population distribution has been the tendency to gather\r\ninto groups, so that a great city like the capital or like Guadalajara\r\nor Puebla will have a dozen cities and villages of considerable size\r\nclose about it--and then stretches of sparsely populated country for\r\nleagues until another group is found. This is essentially climatic--and\r\ngeographical.\r\n\r\nThe mountain contour of the country and this same grouping of the\r\nimportant centers of population have been the chief influences in the\r\nlocation of the railways. Owing to the absence of navigable streams,\r\nthe mere possibility of Mexico’s industrial and of even her true\r\nnational development had to wait upon the coming of the railways. The\r\nfirst line was that completed in 1872 by English capital between Vera\r\nCruz, the chief port of the Gulf of Mexico, and the City of Mexico,\r\nsome 400 miles inland and a mile and a half above the level of the\r\nport. This “Mexican Railway” touches the groups of cities along the\r\nold Spanish highway, and gave them an industrial primacy which was\r\nunchallenged until the very last years of the Diaz peace.\r\n\r\nAfter the building of this first line railway construction turned to\r\nfollow the great natural avenues laid out by the mountain valleys.\r\nThere were, as we have seen, two main valleys, that between the Eastern\r\nand Western Mother ranges, and that to the east of the Eastern chain.\r\nLooking at a map of Mexico, the most casual observer is struck by\r\nthe fact mentioned more than once by Mexican revolutionists, that\r\nboth these valleys lead directly to the heart of the United States.\r\nThe railroads which were built there might indeed be taken to have\r\nbeen built to drain Mexico’s resources into the United States. But it\r\nwas only because these roadbeds had been laid out by Nature herself\r\nthat the lines came to be built there, with the inevitable result of\r\nincreasing immeasurably the importance of the United States to Mexican\r\ndevelopment. One early Mexican president (Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada,\r\n1872-76), in fact, refused to allow these obvious roads to be built,\r\nexplaining, in a much-quoted phrase: “Between the weak and the strong,\r\nlet the desert remain.”\r\n\r\nThe roads were both built by American companies under President Diaz,\r\nthe Mexican National on the east, the Mexican Central on the west.\r\nThey had a mighty part to play in the modernizing of Mexico, and in\r\nher development through the trade in the minerals and in the building\r\nof such industries as followed them. Throughout their history to the\r\npresent, they have been of far greater importance to Mexico than to her\r\nallegedly covetous northern neighbor.\r\n\r\nAfter these lines were built, others came, to follow the mountain\r\nvalleys. One went from Mexico City westward to Guadalajara, tapping the\r\nrich Valley of the Lerma, the granary of Mexico. Narrow gauge lines\r\ntwisted through the rich states of Mexico and Michoacan, lines which\r\nwhen modernized and extended in some future time will open agricultural\r\nand mining territory comparable to anything yet known to commerce\r\nand Mexican industry. Another line found its way to Oaxaca, deep in\r\nthe mountains to the east and south of Mexico City. Others followed\r\nthe seacoast to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and crossed that narrow,\r\nshallow neck of land to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAlong the western slope of the Sierra Madre other lines were built\r\nthrough Sonora, and then the Southern Pacific of Mexico, an American\r\ncompany, pushed these roads still further southward, opening new\r\nterritory, not to the commerce of Central Mexico, but to that of the\r\nUnited States. And last of all, the line to Guadalajara left its easy\r\ngrades and smooth roadbed to leap the _barrancas_ and climb down the\r\nmountains to achieve the contact with the Pacific at Manzanillo. A\r\nmighty hand, indeed, has nature had in the locating of Mexico’s\r\nrailway lines, and with their connection to the United States and our\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe mountainous character of the Mexican territory has upturned vast\r\nmineral resources, whose effect on the development of the country\r\nhas been greater perhaps than any other single fact. These minerals\r\ngave the wealth of the Aztecs which tempted the Spaniards to take\r\nand to develop the country so thoroughly. They were drained for the\r\nthree centuries that Spain ruled, and their exploitation shaped all\r\nthe policy of the colonial régime. They were the greatest of the\r\nattractions to foreign capital at the beginning of the Diaz rule,\r\nand they paid most of the revenue of taxes upon which the material\r\ncivilization of the Mexico of that day was built. It seems safe\r\nto promise that when there is lengthened peace again in Mexico,\r\nmining will take its place with the greatest industries of the\r\ncountry--although oil may still retain its present primacy when it,\r\ntoo, can spread out and develop itself.\r\n\r\nMining camps and groups of mining camps dot the country, and whole\r\ndistinct territories are devoted to the mining, here of silver,\r\nthere of gold, there of copper, lead, etc. Indeed, the geography of\r\nMexico has had a tremendous effect in the creation there of a country\r\nprimarily rich in minerals as she is poor in agriculture. Oil is to-day\r\nthe greatest single wealth of Mexico, but the other minerals have had\r\nand will again have their important bearing on her development.\r\n\r\nThe mineral wealth (oil as well as metals) has as I have noted been\r\nthe chief attraction which has brought foreign capital to Mexico.\r\nThe Spaniards and to a lesser extent the Indians before them, mined\r\nthe mountains of Mexico, but it remained to foreign enterprise in\r\nthe time of Diaz to open up the great bonanza sections to scientific\r\ndevelopment. In the train of this development, came more foreign\r\ncapital of every sort, for agriculture, for industry, for oil, and for\r\npublic service investment. This foreign capital, developing Mexico’s\r\nlatent wealth, opened her to the world, and brought forth her great\r\npromise of the future, even though it also gave to the revolutionists\r\nwho overthrew Diaz a handy battle cry of anti-foreignism.\r\n\r\nIt seems unlikely that without the geographical and geological\r\nconditions which offered the wealth of minerals to the development\r\nof capital, Mexico would or could have entered upon the modern stage\r\nof her development. In that was the hope of the past and in it,\r\ntoo, is the hope of the future regeneration of Mexico. The tempting\r\npossibilities of such development are the only bait which will bring\r\nback to Mexico the stream of foreign capital to which alone she can\r\nlook for her prompt salvation, when peace comes at last.\r\n\r\nThe geography and climate have had their hand, too, in the industrial\r\nsituation in Mexico. Mining, in the time of Diaz, drained the available\r\nlabor away from the farms and away from the small factories which then\r\nexisted. The oil fields have more recently taken a large proportion of\r\nthe available workers. The supply of labor in Mexico is astonishingly\r\nsmall--the development of the latent labor supplies in the Indian\r\ncommunes waits on peace and education. Temperamentally (and in this we\r\nfind the hand of climate) the Mexican is not a good factory worker.\r\nThe raw products which the land produces, sisal hemp, cotton, rubber,\r\netc., all demand for their profitable manufacture large and intricate\r\nplants, such as Mexico has not built and for whose operation she has\r\nnever trained her people. Therefore, save for the cotton factories\r\n(which produce only the coarser staples) there is to-day in Mexico\r\nalmost no industrial development. The lists of industries of which\r\nsuch a manufacturing town as Monterey boasts, include, for instance,\r\ncandle and match factories employing thirty or forty people, brass bed\r\n“factories,” where the products of American foundries are put together,\r\nsoda water factories--the industries which no city in any other land\r\nwould find worth mentioning. Mexican industry, indeed, waits surely\r\nupon the development of the crops of raw materials, upon the education\r\nof her laboring classes, and upon the solution of the problems of\r\nirrigation and water power.\r\n\r\nGeography and climate have been cruel to Mexico,--of this we need\r\nnot seek to deceive ourselves. But throughout the list of unhappy\r\nconditions which has been set down here there runs a promise of\r\nadvancement and of better things--when peace comes and when foreign\r\nenterprise shall again be welcomed. All of the advance which Mexico has\r\nmade in her long fight against an unkind Nature has been made with the\r\nhelp of foreign energy. First was Spain, and the 300 years in which she\r\nbuilt up the colony to a semblance of a modern state, creating great\r\ncities and peace and prosperity. Then, after fifty years of destructive\r\nrevolution, Diaz, and his wise invitation to and use of foreign\r\nenterprises and foreign money. Only in these two periods has Mexico\r\nbeen prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe greatest advance was under Diaz, when in thirty years Mexico\r\nrose from the ashes of her revolutions and flew toward the heights\r\nof commercial advancement. In that time her railways were almost\r\nall of them built, all the water power which she now has developed,\r\nthe one great and productive irrigation section--the Laguna cotton\r\ndistrict--reclaimed from the desert, the sisal hemp industry created,\r\nthe factories, such as they are, built and set in operation. Virtually\r\nall of these advances were made with foreign capital and under the\r\ncontrol of foreign engineers and managers. Success rewarded the faith\r\nand the efforts of all who devoted themselves to these developments and\r\nit was their conquering of the great natural handicaps of Mexico which\r\nmade possible the glowing tales of her “treasure-house.” When such\r\ntimes as those come again, and only when they come, will the battle\r\nagainst Nature be resumed, and in its resumption, the signs of man’s\r\ngreat conquest reappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] This chapter is based upon the author’s article on Mexican\r\nGeography contributed to the important _Mexican Year Book for 1920-21_,\r\npublished in Los Angeles, Calif., concurrently with this volume.\r\n\r\n[3] _The People of Mexico_, Book I, Chap. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                          THE PEOPLE WHO BUY\r\n\r\n\r\nA bamboo hut with a clumsy thatch of grass, a hovel of sundried\r\nbricks, made, as the Israelites made them, of straw and clay, a shack\r\nof unfinished lumber or rotting railway ties topped with a roof of\r\nlaminated sheet-iron--these are the symbols of the social level of\r\nMexico. Within them all a dirt floor, a box filled with earth for a\r\nbrazier, two or three earthenware pots, a _metate_ over which the woman\r\nbends at her endless task of grinding meal for the family cakes of\r\nunleavened corn, a few rush mats for beds and a tawdry shrine with a\r\ndim light before it--the inert millions of Mexico live to-day as they\r\nhave lived for a thousand years.\r\n\r\nTheir minds untutored, their thoughts and desires confined literally\r\nto the animal plane, their religious instincts almost entirely\r\nsuperstition, their government the support of rulers upon the vast\r\nmisery of the lowly, Mexico finds her parallels only in China and in\r\nTurkey. And Mexico is at our own back door, the cynosure of our most\r\nhopeful tradesmen!\r\n\r\nUp until ten years ago, there was an aristocracy in Mexico counting in\r\nits make-up many able men, groups of able men, devoted as far as their\r\nlights allowed them, to a paternalistic care of the Indians and peons,\r\nand to the development of Mexico as a great, modern state. Under Diaz\r\nthere was also a slow building of a material civilization, looking, in\r\nthe future, to the filling of the peon stomach and the lifting of the\r\npeon mind through education to the light of the white man’s world, to\r\na place in the white man’s commerce. It has been the common usage, in\r\nthis past decade since Diaz fell, to excoriate that aristocracy, to\r\nblame it for all the evils of the country, to point with bitter scorn\r\nat its wealth, at its material monuments of churches and palaces and\r\nmines and railways. And yet, although these ten years of revolutions\r\nhave been devoted most effectively to the elimination of the Mexican\r\nupper classes and of their materialism and its monuments, the condition\r\nof the lower classes has not been alleviated by one tiny burden, nor\r\nhas it been lifted by one hair’s breadth.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans of to-day are worse off than they were in the days of\r\nDiaz; they are worse off than in that wild revolutionary period before\r\nDiaz; I am not so sure that they are not in worse condition than they\r\nwere under the Spaniards, for they seem literally to be sliding back to\r\nan era of barbarism like only to that misery which was theirs before\r\nthe Spaniards came.\r\n\r\nWe lose sight of the essential fact of Mexico, commercially as well as\r\nsocially, if we lose sight for one moment of the lowest of the Mexican\r\npeople. They present to us our first and greatest problem, whether\r\nwe are traders, missionaries, or those who seek to develop Mexico’s\r\nresources or to sell her our goods.\r\n\r\nIt is they who must buy our merchandise or aid our work or operate our\r\nfactories, mines and oil wells. They were, and are, a vast potential\r\nmarket, a great, slow-moving force for us to re-shape by education into\r\nan advanced people, civilized, progressive, using the products of the\r\nworld and pouring their own products back into the stream of commerce.\r\nThey offer us an immense, a wonderful well of labor, perhaps a greater\r\ncontributant to the nation’s future wealth than anything else in all\r\nMexico. Because of these potentialities and because of our inability to\r\nunderstand why such possibilities do not find their development, it is\r\nvital that we look, clear-eyed and sympathetically, on the one great\r\nand overwhelming factor in that hopeless inertia--the ignorance of the\r\nmass of the Mexicans.\r\n\r\nMexico is a land of innumerable children. A land where there are twice\r\nas many children under ten years old as there are in the United States\r\n(in proportion to population). And a land where not one child in six\r\nhas even the chance to go to school, because there are no schools for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe depth of Mexico’s ignorance, in childhood and in adulthood, in life\r\nand in business, literally passes comprehension. The active, curious\r\nminds of the Indian youngsters grow quickly into sodden stupidity; the\r\nkeen and vivid intelligences of the children of the middle and upper\r\nclasses expend their growing forces in sensuality and plunge themselves\r\nand their country into debilitating excesses--because there is no\r\ntraining to give them a life above the animals.\r\n\r\nI have seen, in the seats of government in Mexico, men who know less\r\nof world history than a boy in an American high school; I have talked\r\nwith “experts” of government departments who knew less of their special\r\nsubjects than did I, a layman. I have seen in the presidential chair\r\nmen who believed, literally, that the shrunken, sick Mexico of to-day\r\nwas one of the great, advanced countries of the world--because they had\r\nno conception of the development of world civilization.\r\n\r\nI have seen, in Mexican homes, the slow murder of Mexican babies,\r\nbecause neither I nor any one else could change the round of tradition,\r\nunrelieved by training of any sort, which takes an annual toll of child\r\nlife in Mexico that is perhaps not surpassed even by the toll of the\r\nfamine in China.\r\n\r\nThe chain of tradition links Mexico together, and links her, too, to a\r\npast which goes back into the furthest reaches of prehistoric legend.\r\n\r\nThe ways of modern agriculture are those of the early Aztecs, and\r\nmodern tools, even, are introduced with the greatest difficulty. The\r\nround of life is a brief cycle of dull days, unlivened by any thought\r\nor knowledge beyond the confines of a village or a township or a few\r\nblocks of a city. The schools, such as they are, are patterned after\r\nmodels long abandoned everywhere else in the world, and are stifled\r\nby a traditional belief that war and revolution and the erection of\r\nimposing buildings are more important to the progress of the country\r\nthan the education of its youth.\r\n\r\nAll this has driven Mexico on through the years handicapped with a load\r\nof illiteracy that can well be recognized as the most potent factor in\r\nthe degeneration that marks her every manifestation to-day.\r\n\r\nOnly figures can tell, even in part, the depths of that ignorance. Back\r\nin 1895, the Mexican government reports (which one must always remember\r\nspeak as favorably as they dare) showed that only 2,000,000 out of\r\na population of 12,500,000 could read and write! This means that 82\r\nper cent of all the people of Mexico were without these rudiments of\r\nlearning. By 1900 this percentage had been reduced to 80 and in 1910\r\nthe Diaz government claimed that it had been reduced to 78, in other\r\nwords that of the 15,000,000 population of that year, a little over\r\n3,000,000 could read and write, while nearly 12,000,000 remained in\r\nthe depths of their ignorance. In 1919, the Carranza government issued\r\na report claiming but a slight advance over these figures in the nine\r\nyears since the fall of Diaz.\r\n\r\nIt is literally true that not a tenth of all the people in Mexico have\r\nwhat we would call a common school education, and three out of four\r\ncannot read a street sign or scrawl their own names. Indeed, one great\r\nBritish mining company reported that of its 595 Mexican employees,\r\nincluding scores of what we would call skilled workmen, only six, or\r\nabout one per cent could sign a receipt for the money they were paid.\r\n\r\nTo those of us who look on through foreign eyes, this condition\r\nexplains much of Mexico’s dilemma, and the point is further clarified\r\nwhen we know that the greatest claim ever made for Mexican education\r\nshowed but 12,000 schools, with 850,000 pupils enrolled--while the\r\npopulation of children of school age was more than 4,000,000! No single\r\nissue is greater or more pressing than education. Yet education waits,\r\nas everything in Mexico waits, on peace and better times, on food\r\nand on health. And these wait--and more than all, from our selfish\r\ninterest, business and commerce wait--on education! Around and around\r\nthe problem swings, and each issue is dependent upon another, and that,\r\nthen, upon the first.\r\n\r\nOf all the complicated, interwoven factors of Mexican life and of\r\nthe tendencies, this very day, of Mexican business and trade none,\r\nhowever, offers so true an understanding as race. The basis of Mexico’s\r\nignorance and the basis of her steel-bound traditions is Indianism.\r\nFor Mexico’s 15,000,000 people include 6,000,000 pure-blooded Indians,\r\nof some fifty tribal strains, literal aborigines in their life and in\r\ntheir thoughts. There are, as I have noted, 8,000,000 mixed-bloods,\r\nthree-quarters of whom are virtually Indians in their way of life and\r\nin their outlook upon the world. And there are only 1,000,000 of white\r\nstrain, mostly Spanish, a group which is to-day without voice in the\r\naffairs of the country. Two-thirds of Mexico is Indian, and most of the\r\nother third a mixture of Indian and white, a mass with the dark Indian\r\nsea below it and virtually no light coming to it from above.\r\n\r\nTo-day there sifts into the Mexican ruling classes--these same\r\nmixed-bloods--hardly a ray of culture, hardly a gleam of a truly\r\nbroader outlook, to lift them and their people out of the dull cavern\r\nof their circumscribed life, or to lead them to the better things of\r\nmodern civilization and commerce. We talk of the heathen of China, of\r\nthe darkness of ignorance and superstition in Africa, but in Mexico\r\nthe churches and the foreign industrial concerns seem to me to face a\r\ngreater need than in any other country in the world.\r\n\r\nFor Mexico is at our door, and the cultural traditions of Mexico are\r\nthose of our own world, the white. For 300 years she was a subject\r\nstate of Spain, and for all the mistakes of the Spaniards and the Roman\r\nCatholic Church, the foundation-stones they laid are as the foundation\r\nstones of our own life.\r\n\r\nThe Indian mass was the great problem of Spain; it was the great\r\nproblem of Diaz; it is the great problem of all those who would lead\r\nher to the ways of the world of to-day. For the past ten years it has\r\nbeen forgotten, lost in the struggles of individual men for personal\r\npower. But always those individuals have been swallowed up, without\r\ntheir realizing it, in the mire of Indianism, for Indianism, the\r\nvery epitome of ignorance, lies there always beneath the Mexico that\r\nthe world sees, waiting to engulf its own masters and to destroy all\r\nsocial and business progress. The Spaniards and Diaz built above these\r\nshifting sands, ever conscious of them, providing against them always.\r\nDiaz fell because after he built his foundations he did not reach\r\ndown into the Indian mass to up-raise them. He fell in his old age,\r\nforgetting, as old men forget, the dangers which have been with them\r\nthrough all their life. But before he fell he had laid the foundations,\r\nbuilding upon those of the Spaniards and erecting new ones of his\r\nown, among them foundations of foreign business, of foreign missions,\r\nof foreign schools, business and missions and schools which by their\r\nown enterprise and perhaps as much by the examples which they set for\r\nMexican business, Catholic churches and native school teachers, were\r\nbeginning the great uplift of that vast, inert Indian mass.\r\n\r\nThe brief rule of Madero (1911-1913) was the link between Diaz and the\r\nupheaval of radicalism and Indianism which was to begin with Carranza,\r\nin 1914. Then commenced the process of casting away, bit by bit, all\r\nthe slow-built civilization, all the shallow foundations of commercial\r\nprosperity, of Diaz. With Carranza began the upsurgence of the Indian,\r\nthe terrific push upward of the long-hidden forces of destruction which\r\nhad been held in check, not only for the thirty years of the Diaz\r\npeace, but for all the four centuries since the Spaniards had first\r\ncome to Mexico.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, this destruction was marked by the wiping out of the fabric\r\nof the promising Mexican educational system--for Diaz had made sound\r\nbeginnings toward raising the Indians out of the depths of their\r\nignorance. His rule was building a foundation for business and for\r\nprogress by creating an intelligence which would demand and would\r\ndevelop the better things which white civilization had to offer.\r\n\r\nUnder Carranza the ideal was not of slow uplift by education and the\r\ncreation of a substantial economic existence which would make life and\r\npeace worth striving for. Carranza and those who followed him under the\r\nbanner of the revolution have thought little of solid progress. Their\r\nideal has been revolution--the political remedy for the economic ills\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nSo, despite all the sweeping promises of Carranza and his immediate\r\nsuccessors, education and the progress of business, of trade and\r\nof development have gone into the discard. With the pressure of\r\nthe needs of the revolutionary “generals” for greater and greater\r\nappropriations for their armies (and for the graft which ate up most\r\nof such appropriations), with the ever-widening circle of vampires who\r\nfattened on government patronage in every other conceivable way, the\r\nmoney available for education as well as for industrial advancement\r\nshrank steadily. Where under Diaz the total annual budget of the\r\ngovernment was $50,000,000 a year, with a total appropriation for\r\nschools, federal and state, probably less than $4,000,000, Carranza\r\nhad nearer $100,000,000 and spent less than $2,000,000 a year on\r\neducation. For Carranza, when the demands of his “generals” for their\r\n“share” increased, shut off the federal support of the schools of the\r\nCity of Mexico and its neighboring villages, and also the sums which\r\nin other days had gone to help the poorly provided state governments.\r\nHe threw the school systems on the hands of absolutely bankrupt cities\r\nand towns, with the result that in the City of Mexico alone some 120\r\nschools, half the former number, were closed, and 25,000 children,\r\ndespite crowding into other buildings, were deprived of education. All\r\nthis is history. And statistics do not show that there has been any\r\nrecovery since that day.\r\n\r\nThe Obregon government, on paper, re-established the federal department\r\nof education with a cabinet officer at its head, which was abolished\r\nby Carranza as an economy measure. There was some more of the endless\r\nMexican discussion of systems of education, but so far as can be\r\nfound, no increase in appropriations or in plans for better support\r\nof the public schools. All those wait, perhaps, as I have said, on\r\nthe improvement of business conditions, as the final solution of the\r\nbusiness problem waits, I believe, upon them.\r\n\r\nBut they all wait on something else, which I have mentioned above,\r\nand that is the improved physical condition of the Mexican people.\r\nComfort, food and health are as important to mental and moral\r\ndevelopment as the training of the mind by education. The misery of\r\nMexico is so profound, her crashing inertia so deep-rooted and so\r\nself-perpetuating, that it sometimes seems that she can never be cured\r\nfrom within herself. Some outside force must break the circle and this\r\nI believe is the great opportunity of the American missions, working in\r\nconjunction with the great civilizing energies of American business.\r\n\r\nAlready something has been done, by great American business concerns,\r\nand by American trade unions along the northern border and even within\r\nMexico itself, to improve living conditions. But the terrific chasm of\r\nthe Mexican mass remains utterly unplumbed, and the childhood of Mexico\r\nand the manhood and womanhood of Mexico wait, hungry because their food\r\ndoes not feed them; in discomfort because their long traditions do not\r\nlet them even desire comfort; in sickness because of utter ignorance of\r\nthe foundations of human health.\r\n\r\nOf this last a word must be written here. I have compiled,\r\nelsewhere,[4] the astonishing figures bearing upon this question, and\r\nhave found, in the mass of Mexican official statistics, that the death\r\nrate of Mexican babies under one year is nearly twice that of the\r\nUnited States; between birth and ten years, three times that of this\r\ncountry, and that clear through the whole range of Mexican life, from\r\ntwo to four times as many Mexicans die in each thousand as die in the\r\nUnited States at the same ages. The average life of every Mexican born\r\nis but 15 years, while in the United States it is about 35 years, and\r\nhalf of the Mexicans born this year will be dead before they are 7\r\nyears old, while in the United States half of all the babies born will\r\nlive to be 42 years old.\r\n\r\nHigh death rate means sickness. Experts estimate that for each death in\r\nthe United States there are 300 days of severe illness and 6,000 days\r\nof indisposition or slight illness, spread over the average 35 years of\r\nAmerican life. But in Mexico the average age of death is 15 years, so\r\nthat the days of sickness must be crowded into less than half the space\r\nof time they cover in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, almost no care, as we conceive it, is given to the sick.\r\nThe government reports show that only one-quarter of all the deaths\r\nreported in the country are listed as “classified by the doctor”--in\r\nother words, there is no medical attendance at all in three-quarters\r\nof all the fatal illnesses in Mexico. It is well known to those who\r\nknow that unhappy land that in the case of illness, the priest and the\r\ndoctor are sent for at the same time, the priest to administer extreme\r\nunction, the doctor to do what he can with a dying patient.\r\n\r\nThis factor of ill-health in Mexico is one of the most terrible of\r\nall the pictures of her misery, perhaps the most potent element in\r\nthe national ineptitude. No one who is continually ill can be greatly\r\ninterested in progress, mental, or moral, or industrial, for illness\r\nis the greatest force working against the material advancement of the\r\npeople and of the country. And upon material advancement, upon the\r\nincrease of income and the increase of needs physical and cultural (as\r\nthe money comes to procure them) we must build the solidity of the\r\nMexican people that are to be, as well as the trade which we seek to\r\ngain from them.\r\n\r\nOut of this picture of darkness, then, comes opportunity and with\r\nopportunity the dawning of a new day in Mexico. Because ill health is\r\nso great a factor as it is, there is something that we can attack and\r\ncan conquer. Because education is at the low ebb that it is, there is\r\nsomething which we can do that is direct and tangible, when the means\r\nare put into our hands.\r\n\r\nThere is hope in Mexico, and that hope is tied up with the opportunity\r\nfor foreign help, which is actually, and even more potentially, the\r\nmost disinterested and direct force working on conditions in Mexico\r\nto-day. The land is so torn by personal politics, so nearly ruined\r\nby the exactions of unthinking government, so much the football of\r\nwell-deserved calumny, that this single ray of clean, clear light can\r\nbe recognized by all as one of the great hopes in the horizon to-day.\r\nThat hope must be made to dawn, and it is well for us to consider how\r\nthat dawn may be assured, and how the day which must follow may be\r\nfirmly grounded on economic permanence, on social stability and on\r\nthe comfort, health, education and industrial progress of the Mexican\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThis is the field wherein I believe that the coöperation of the\r\nAmerican companies established in Mexico and the American missions\r\noperating there will bring about a solution of the ultimate Mexican\r\nproblem. For the companies, ready and anxious as they appear to be to\r\nserve, would, through the missions, find a means wherein their money\r\nand the great force of their prestige would have efficient direction.\r\nThe foreign oil, mining and railway corporations will not hesitate,\r\nI believe, to place their resources and their opportunities at the\r\ndisposal of workers whom they are convinced can truly improve the\r\nmorale and thus the productive capacity of the workers upon whom their\r\nbusiness depends. Heretofore there has been mutual misunderstanding.\r\nThe companies have not always found the mission workers as efficient as\r\nthey would like, and the missionaries have been quite ready to suspect\r\nthe companies of representing “predatory capital” with the ambition,\r\nnot merely of making their business profitable, but of putting down the\r\n“devoted” leaders of the people or of forcing American intervention at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nI have faith in both the companies and the missionaries, and I believe\r\nthat in the new political crisis which Mexico is bringing upon herself\r\nas this is written (and which she may have tumbling about her ears\r\nbefore it is printed) these two must reach out, and will reach out, to\r\nclasp hands and go on together.\r\n\r\nBoth have done wonderful things for Mexican education, the missions\r\nthrough the conscious development in Mexico of the ideal of education\r\nfor service, and to the end of raising and training leaders for the\r\nMexican masses, and the companies through isolated examples of truly\r\nconstructive welfare and educational work.\r\n\r\nProbably the most outstanding example of the educational achievements\r\nof American corporations was that of the trade schools which were\r\norganized and operated by the National Railroad between 1890 and\r\n1912, under the direction of E. N. Brown, president of the National\r\nRailways--one of the “pernicious foreigners” who were exiled under\r\nCarranza’s “nationalization” of the railway properties in 1914. These\r\nrailway schools trained between 15,000 and 18,000 Mexican mechanics\r\nand engineers, taking boys of 14 and 15, paying them first 62 cents a\r\nday and gradually increasing that until, after four years’ training,\r\nthey were receiving three and a half pesos a day. They were then\r\nready to take positions as skilled workers in the railway shops or on\r\nthe locomotives or, if they chose, in other industries. The railway\r\nplaced no limitation on them, holding that the company benefited in the\r\nincrease of the efficiency of the Mexican worker wherever he might be.\r\n\r\nThe whole scheme of this work, including the paying of apprentices\r\nwhile learning, was the broadest kind of educational service, taken\r\nup, to be sure, because the railway company needed mechanics and\r\ntrainmen, but with an effect on Mexico and on the creation of the\r\nso-called Mexican “middle class” (the buying and building as well as\r\nthe elevating element in any population) which is still felt through\r\nthe chaos of revolutionary destruction.\r\n\r\nTo-day the greatest industry of Mexico is the production and refining\r\nof petroleum, and foreign companies, of course, control it. Much\r\ngenuinely helpful welfare work is being done by them, including not\r\nonly schools for children but training schools for workers as well. In\r\naddition the very conscious plan of increasing wages until unskilled\r\nlabor now receives a minimum of $2 a day is having a remarkable effect\r\nupon the standard of living and upon the buying capacity (as well as\r\nupon the efficiency) of the Mexicans of the Tampico oil section. There\r\nis much undigested prosperity, and agitators are creating trouble as\r\nfar as they can for the foreigners, but on the whole the effect on the\r\nmaterial well-being of the peon has been advantageous. It is inevitable\r\nthat a continuation of this attitude should bring forth a vastly\r\nincreased civilization at least in this one section of Mexico.\r\n\r\nEducation has been pushed forward by the companies, and in the model\r\nvillages such as the town of Terminal (across the river from Tampico\r\non the property of the Doheny companies) really excellent schools are\r\nmaintained with Mexican teachers under American supervision.\r\n\r\nConditions in the oil country outside the private company towns are,\r\nhowever, deplorable, presenting a contrast which is not without its\r\nmighty lesson for us all. The graft and incompetence of the present\r\nruling classes of Mexico have regarded the prosperous oil towns only as\r\nthe most luxurious of posts for influential favorites. The educational\r\nconditions of Tampico, where in a city of more than 100,000 people\r\nthere are only twenty government primary schools with an attendance of\r\n4,500 pupils, beggars description. Yet the foreign companies have been\r\ncalled on regularly to support the Tampico schools, just as they are\r\ncalled on to pay for pavements, sanitation, etc. And this money has\r\ngone, hardly a single dollar into the work for which it was collected,\r\nbut countless thousands into the bottomless pit of revolutionary graft.\r\n\r\nBut for all the unfortunate conditions of the moment, the possibilities\r\nof the foreign corporations aiding in the uplift of the Mexican\r\nmass throughout the country is one of the encouraging phases of the\r\nMexican trade and business problem. It links up definitely with the\r\nsolution (on which we shall touch, in later chapters) of the parts of\r\nthe question which deal with other elements than the human equation.\r\nThe beginning which has been made in Tampico, chiefly by the great\r\nAmerican companies, carries with it an import far greater than the\r\nmere contrast between their trim little company villages and schools\r\nand the ugly squalor of the Mexican towns. Somehow, out of the dark\r\npresent, American business has learned how closely it is linked with\r\nthe welfare of the human element in its scheme. They have learned how\r\nthe simple man, how his happiness and prosperity, are wrapped up with\r\nthe prosperity and success of every enterprise which remotely touches\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nUntil these recent years, and through these American corporations,\r\nthere has never been scientific welfare work in Mexico, there has\r\nnever been considerate treatment of the workers, little study of\r\ntheir weaknesses and their needs. If we contemplate that, in its bare\r\ntruth, we can begin to understand something of the importance of even\r\nthe relatively little work which has been done of late. Perhaps the\r\ngreatest potentiality of the future of the human side of the Mexican\r\nmarket lies in the broad extension of that genuinely American attitude\r\ntoward the masses of the country.\r\n\r\nI have advocated the union of the forces of American missionaries and\r\nAmerican corporations in Mexico. I believe that this will bring great\r\ngood and will eventually, as it has done in this country, bring a\r\nhigher efficiency of labor and a larger market for the things which\r\nthis country can export to Mexico. The desertion of the masses by the\r\nrevolutionary government and the exile of the natural aristocracy, have\r\nbrought the human problem of the country home with tremendous force to\r\nthe foreigners. It lies to-day almost solely in their hands, and seems\r\nlikely to wait long for a rescue or aid from any other source whatever.\r\n\r\nFor the missionaries, education and improved economic conditions\r\namongst the workers is indispensable--they are the tools and the signs\r\nof their great plan of regeneration. For business, the encouragement\r\nof religion and education which the mission schools give promises that\r\nimprovement in the laboring population and in the buying capacity of\r\nthat population which is demanded by the advancement of their business.\r\nSomehow that buying population which I have set at 3,000,000 must be\r\nincreased. Somehow the efficiency of the laboring group (which numbers\r\nlittle more than the buying public) must be increased. Only one way\r\nis open--to make the masses better men, happier men, more cultured\r\nmen. The ignorance of Mexico, the inefficiency which results from that\r\nignorance, the low standard of living which keeps the people from those\r\n“wants” which make luxuries into necessities and so improve trade by\r\nwidening the eddies of demand--all these affect us all in Mexico.\r\n\r\nTrade follows education. It follows the missionaries of business and\r\nof religion. It thrives alone on the prosperity of peoples. To-day\r\nthese factors of trade in Mexico are only depressants--in the future\r\nthey must and surely will be changed slowly into booming creators of\r\ntrade. But so long as the chief item of import is food and so long as\r\nthe productive capacity of the Mexicans is only half developed, so long\r\nwill the market in Mexico swing at its lowest ebb.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] _The People of Mexico._ Mexican health is treated directly in the\r\nchapter on “Vitality,” pp. 86-109, and indirectly in the chapter on\r\n“Climate,” pp. 131-151.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n               THE CREDIT OF MEXICO AND OF THE MEXICANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mexican government to-day is bankrupt, and Mexican business\r\nis bankrupt. The most sanguine propagandists of the revolutionary\r\ngovernments can offer nothing better than promises to offset the\r\nobvious facts of Mexican finance. The government to-day owes nearly\r\na billion dollars--including unpaid interest on her debts for eleven\r\nyears. Commercial credit has reflected the ghastly vision of government\r\nbankruptcy, because the ingrained principle of Mexican politics has\r\nbeen the subservience of economic progress to political exigencies.\r\n\r\nThe history of Mexican revolutionary government has been marked by the\r\nsteady suction of business into the maelstrom of political horror. This\r\nbegan in the earliest years of the rule of Carranza (1914-1920). For\r\nfive years Carranza carried on a deliberate campaign to destroy the\r\nbanks, as the representatives of the capitalists. He succeeded, despite\r\nall the magnificent resiliency of business. He swamped the country with\r\npaper currency; he withdrew the metallic reserves of the banks until\r\ntheir bank notes reached almost the degradation of his own issues. He\r\nmade Mexico into a land of thieves, and gave their thievery the cloak\r\nof government sanction--as of one thief underwriting the ventures of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWhen her banks were gone, Mexico had nothing left but her mines and\r\nher oil, for Mexico creates virtually no wealth. She manufactures\r\nnothing and exports nothing save the ultimately exhaustible resources\r\nof her soil. Mining flourished during the war, with allied governments\r\nsupporting the lead and silver markets, and oil has flowed on and\r\ncontinues to flow, giving Mexico herself only the curse of incalculable\r\nunearned wealth for the personal loot of her government officials.\r\n\r\nCredit was Mexico’s great asset under Diaz--he spent years in\r\nestablishing it and upon it he built the nation. To-day in Mexico there\r\nis no credit. There is gold in circulation and the sight of gold is\r\nencouraging to the business man. But the gold in Mexico circulates\r\nbecause there is no credit; no man trusts another and none trusts the\r\npromises of the government. Mexico cannot to-day issue paper money, and\r\nher heavily alloyed silver coin is on a par with her gold only because\r\nan artificial scarcity is maintained in order to increase the value of\r\nsilver as the change needed in business.\r\n\r\nMexico is one of the great potential markets of the world. The American\r\nmanufacturer can justly look to it for an outlet for his wares. But\r\na market is useless until the buyer can pay for his goods. Mexico is\r\nnot yet a place to dispose of what we make until she can pay for what\r\nshe takes. The credit situation is the crux of Mexico, and the crux of\r\nthe credit situation is the political chauvinism which, eight years\r\nago, set out deliberately to destroy that credit, because credit was\r\ncapitalism and capitalism was unfriendly to the self-appointed leaders\r\nof the proletariat and, more important still, was said to be the enemy\r\nof that world radical movement to which the Mexican revolutionary\r\nleaders look so smugly to save them from interference in their orgy of\r\nloot and glory.\r\n\r\nWhen Diaz left the presidency in 1911, there were $35,000,000 in the\r\nnational treasury, and Mexico’s credit was such that she could float\r\nat par a national bond issue drawing 4¹⁄₂ per cent. To-day the unpaid\r\ninterest on her public obligations exceeds $150,000,000 and she cannot\r\nat any price borrow a cent on any security less than the indorsement of\r\nthe government of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThis is the way the situation is expressed in cold figures. But Mexico\r\nis a land of infinite resource, both natural and diplomatic, and\r\nnations in worse condition than this have been taken in hand by great\r\nbankers and placed upon their financial feet. Any Mexican official can\r\nexplain Mexico’s condition convincingly--the long years of revolution,\r\nthe paralyzation of industry through destruction and through the prices\r\nand want brought to all the world by the Great War. It is therefore of\r\nno really deep significance, they say, that Mexico owes millions of\r\ndollars, and that she is to-day suing for favor in the world’s money\r\nmarkets. But there is a deep and fundamental cause which is back of\r\nher financial bankruptcy, back even of its merely economic causes in\r\nwrecked mines and abandoned factories, in ranches stripped of millions\r\nof head of cattle which bandits have killed for their hides.\r\n\r\nThe real bankruptcy of Mexico goes deep down into the minds of\r\nmen, Mexicans and foreigners, government officials and rabid\r\ninterventionists alike. The bankruptcy of Mexico is a sickness born\r\nof broken faith, a moral bankruptcy that is ugly with human greed and\r\nhopeless with nervous fear.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with Mexico to-day is that Mexicans as well as foreigners\r\nhave ceased to believe in Mexico.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my several recent visits to Mexico, I did not go as a\r\nstranger to the country. I had watched her develop during six years\r\nprior to 1910, under the peace and prosperity of the Diaz régime.\r\nUnderstanding something of the native psychology and much of that\r\nof the foreigners, I was prepared to find that a good deal of the\r\nseriousness of the situation was due to panicky fear and distrust one\r\nof another. What I was not prepared for was a condition where every\r\nincident, every situation, every tight-strung nerve of potential\r\nstrength or weakness led down pell-mell paths to a deep ravine of\r\nutterly blasted faith not only in present conditions in Mexico, but in\r\nthe possibility of the country’s ever crawling back to her old serenity\r\nand strength in any measurable time.\r\n\r\nMexico, as most Americans do not realize, considers herself to have\r\nbeen at peace for the past five years, for the bandits were in the\r\nhills and most “revolutionary” outbreaks were being successfully\r\nnipped. Yet in the important city of Monterey, typical of the interior\r\nof Mexico, the damage done “in the revolution” remains untouched. On\r\nthe main plaza the stones that are left of the beautiful old Casino,\r\nburned by Carranza’s soldiers six years ago, have barely been moved\r\nfrom the roadway. Smoke-stained shells of buildings rise here and\r\nthere, and in the suburbs bullet-ridden windows still remain in fine\r\nprivate houses and factories. The once paved streets are full of\r\nunexpected bumps, the roads leading to the smelters and out into the\r\ncountry are cut deep with ruts and puddles and railway crossings are\r\nall but impassable, even to skipping Fords. The street cars limp and\r\nbump and leak, and the very civic improvements seem installed with a\r\nfatalistic certainty that they will soon be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThere is industry and there is business in Monterey, each of a kind.\r\nIn the old days there were two great smelters, foreign owned, a steel\r\nplant and a brewery, besides three railway shops and miscellaneous\r\nother factories. Most of the miscellaneous factories closed long ago,\r\nbut the smelters and the steel plant kept going in good order--as long\r\nas war prices sustained them. Now, one of the smelters has closed, for\r\nLondon has ceased holding up the lead market, and the other (owned by\r\nthe American Smelting and Refining Company) continues only because it\r\nuses the ore from its own mines. During the war the steel plant was\r\nhandled by the United States War Trade Board, the great organization\r\nwhich harnessed our own industries to war needs, and 80 per cent of its\r\nproduct was, by agreement, sold in the United States and in Cuba--at\r\nwar prices. When the war ended, the Monterey steel plant was forced to\r\ncurtail, and to-day the great blast furnace is cold and only a Mexican\r\ngovernment order for a few thousand tons of steel rails keeps the\r\nrolling mill moving.\r\n\r\nThe railway shops are content with the most perfunctory of repairs,\r\nand are more remarkable for the appalling array of rusted and rotted\r\nengines (I have counted 150 engines out of commission in the Monterey\r\nyards) and for the wrecks of burned freight cars which fill their\r\nsidings than for any activity which inspires their machinery.\r\n\r\nThe few factories which operate are sustained, in their turn, by the\r\nhigh prices which even the staples of existence command in Mexico.\r\nThree small cotton goods factories, reopened five years ago, get\r\nprices only a few cents below those paid for imported goods, to whose\r\ncost in this country is added a heavy import duty. The brewery keeps\r\nrunning, although it pays the government a tax of 100 per cent on its\r\nproduct--estimated to be $1,000 in American gold per day.\r\n\r\nRetail trade goes on, throughout Mexico, but the sales are greatly\r\ncurtailed and the prices are out of reach of the masses, being twice to\r\nfive times those of the last normal period, 1912. Stocks are hopelessly\r\ndepleted, for no merchant will keep a large supply of goods on hand,\r\nfor fear not alone of the long-promised drop in the world market, but\r\nof what will happen in Mexico to-day or to-morrow or next week.\r\n\r\nMoreover, all business is on an absolutely cash basis, and for “hard”\r\nmoney--gold and silver--alone, whether the trade be wholesale or\r\nretail. In Mexico to-day credit is practically unknown, either amongst\r\nMexicans or between Mexican houses and those with whom they deal\r\nabroad. There is a stringency of currency, due to the destruction (for\r\nvarious reasons soon to be noted) of all forms of paper money. Mexico\r\nis spending literally her economic life blood, gold and silver, and her\r\ngreat resources are wasting and rotting because there is no money with\r\nwhich to develop them or to move them.\r\n\r\nThose are simple conditions, patent to any observer who stays longer\r\nthan the few hours or a day allowed the busy junketer on his trip\r\nthrough “prosperous Mexico.” Back of these conditions, however, are\r\nfacts which are as incontrovertible and menacing. The closing of\r\nthe smelters has back of it the conditions of mining, in a country\r\nwhich for centuries has depended on its mines for its existence as an\r\neconomic entity. Even through the war, with war prices for metals, the\r\nmines which were producing were only those with high grade ores, which\r\ncould bear the risks of banditry, the cost of ponderous freight rates,\r\nor could maintain their private railway trains to transport ore which\r\nthe run-down government rolling stock could not handle. Moreover, even\r\nwar time prices did not make possible the proper development of the\r\nproperties, and when the bottom dropped out of the lead and copper\r\nmarkets, many of the richest mines closed, because they had not been\r\nable or had not dared do enough normal development to keep ahead of the\r\nwork on the rich veins.\r\n\r\nBack of the hand-to-mouth operation of factories and wholesale and\r\nretail stores is the situation with regard to currency and banking.\r\nMoney in Mexico is worth, at legal interest, 1 per cent per month (12\r\nper cent per year) but if you have money, and will take a chance, you\r\ncan get 5 per cent a month and even more on as good security as the\r\ncountry affords. So few are the men who believe enough in Mexico to\r\ntake the chance that there is not enough capital even to satisfy the\r\nneeds of speculators. And can legitimate business expand or even carry\r\nits normal load when the money it ought to borrow, the money it has\r\nalready invested, is worth so much as that? The only form of business\r\nwhich thrives in Mexico is speculation, and I think I am safe in saying\r\nthat virtually every sign of business activity which any visitor to\r\nMexico sees to-day is speculative at its source or dependent upon\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nThis speculation finds its chief manifestation in the marketing of\r\nfood--the distribution of the necessities of life is in Mexico, as\r\nelsewhere, the source of sure profit. But in Mexico, so great is\r\nthe fear of men of what may happen, that the profits of speculation\r\ntranscend anything known to our busiest food profiteers. The farmers\r\nwill not take the chances (which include the uncertainties of costly\r\ngraft) incident to getting freight cars or pack animals as well as the\r\nfear of bandits. This allows the speculators, in quick turnovers, to\r\nmake as much as 200 per cent on a car of corn in a fortnight, and this\r\ncondition has lasted for nearly eight years.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of speculative activity is in the importation of foreign\r\ngoods. The Mexican customs laws are complicated with elaborate\r\nclassifications, and at best it is something of a speculation\r\nfor a merchant to import goods in the days of sudden changes in\r\nclassifications and boosts of tariffs without notice. In addition,\r\nhowever, many favored henchmen of government officials have been given\r\nconcessions to import all goods free, privileges which it is said they\r\nsell to any one who will take the risk for a fixed charge of one-half\r\nof the customs fee that would otherwise have been collected. Now and\r\nthen these favored persons take a flyer of their own and one of them\r\nonce sent in a carload of shoes, most of which were dumped in Monterey.\r\nHaving paid no duty, the shoes were sold at prices which demoralized\r\nthe local market, for the normal duty on a pair of shoes averages $1.50.\r\n\r\nOther things “happen.” For instance, a favored group gets a trainload\r\nof goods--say foodstuffs--at an entry port. Then the government\r\nsuddenly announces that, effective at once, the high duties on these\r\nfoodstuffs are to be removed. The goods of those “in the know” go\r\nacross duty free, and if other merchants telegraph orders to take\r\nadvantage of the open port, as like as not they find, when the goods\r\nreach the border, that the high duties have been put back as suddenly\r\nas they were removed.\r\n\r\nSuch things as these happened with great frequency in the days of\r\nCarranza. Perhaps they are not happening now, for Mexico is on her good\r\nbehavior. But all this has occurred frequently enough to have shaken\r\nthe faith of simple men. The fear of what may happen to-morrow--things\r\nof this sort or something else--stifles business, for business is a\r\ntimid spirit, and does not recover its confidence quickly.\r\n\r\nI hold no brief against the present governments of Mexico. They have\r\nbeen and still are revolutionary governments. They have a natural faith\r\nin their own vital importance to Mexico, and consider that whatever it\r\nmay have cost the country to get such government is money well spent.\r\nBut for her own sake and for the sake of those of us who are sincerely\r\ninterested in knowing what troubles Mexico, it seems that we should\r\nrealize by this frank analysis the lack of faith which I describe.\r\n\r\nThe situation which I have just outlined is economic, but back of the\r\neconomic and basically more important is the financial situation. The\r\ncause of the economic bankruptcy is to be found in the new conception\r\nof the financial organization of Mexico which the Carranza officials\r\nhave pronounced, and upon which Mexico has been acting for the past\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\nLet us look for a moment at the financial side of the foreign\r\ninvestments in Mexico, for recent activities on the part of the\r\ngovernment seem to admit that Mexico recognizes that an important\r\nfactor in the present national bankruptcy is the loss of foreign\r\ncapital. This damming up of the flow of foreign investments has been\r\nthe result of two distinct situations. First is the outrages, the\r\nwanton destruction of foreign property and foreign lives by bandits and\r\nrevolutionaries. The other is the enactment and partial enforcement of\r\ndrastic anti-foreign laws.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest pillars of the material prosperity of the Diaz\r\ntime was foreign investments. The bonanza mines had to become paying\r\nlow-grade business propositions in order to preserve mining as a\r\nnational asset. The barren agricultural lands had to be irrigated,\r\nwith water that fell in mountains hundreds of miles away. More than\r\nthat, Mexico had to begin to build an industrial machine of railroads\r\nand factories which would create new national wealth--the economists\r\nof even a generation ago realized that no land, however rich, could\r\nprosper from her natural resources alone. These were the axiomatic\r\nbases of the economic need of foreign money.\r\n\r\nThe financial need for foreign capital was yet more pressing. At\r\nthe beginning of the Diaz rule, the trade balance against Mexico\r\nwas apparently insurmountable, and although year by year it was cut\r\ndown through the economic development of the country, each year the\r\ntrade balance has to be evened up. This was the function of foreign\r\ninvestments, and this was the financial reason for its continued\r\nencouragement under Diaz. To the last year of his reign, this inflow\r\nof foreign money kept coming evenly, in tens and twenties of millions\r\nannually. As it came in, balancing the outgo of interest on the\r\nnational debt and on private loans, it became itself a producer of\r\nMexican wealth, so that in time it would have eliminated the necessity\r\nof further forced-draft encouragement for outside investment.\r\n\r\nThat time had not come in 1911, however, when Diaz left Mexico. But the\r\nnet result of the stoppage of foreign investment in the revolutionary\r\nperiod which followed is to be found to-day in that unpaid interest of\r\nnearly $200,000,000 on government securities alone.\r\n\r\nThis is no apology for the mistakes of the Diaz régime. The great men\r\nof that day built a vast commercial enterprise, the Business of Being\r\nthe Republic of Mexico, but like many commercial enterprises of the\r\nperiod before the Great War, it had left out the human equation. It was\r\nthis failure which wrecked the Diaz government in the end, and made\r\nsuch purely paternalistic régimes virtually impossible in Mexico again.\r\n\r\nTo-day the rulers of Mexico, awake at last to the need for the foreign\r\nmoney which their revolutionary predecessors shut out so stubbornly\r\nunder the “Mexico for the Mexicans” policy and the socialistic\r\nconstitution, have been carrying on an active campaign of publicity and\r\nofficial conciliation. The junkets of Chambers of Commerce from all\r\nover the United States are part of the big plan. Yet in the hearts of\r\nthe people, of this country and of Europe, who hold the purse strings,\r\nbe they bankers or enthusiastic investors of little capital, there\r\nlingers and will linger many doubts. It seems likely to be a long day\r\nbefore the foreign investor finds any new faith in Mexico.\r\n\r\nBut what of Mexico herself? Where lie the financial roots of her lost\r\nfaith in Mexico’s own future? After the economic conditions noted\r\nabove, they lie in the Mexican currency situation.\r\n\r\nTo-day Mexico has no currency but gold, silver, nickel and copper\r\ncoins. There are no bank bills, there is no bankable paper, there are\r\nno promissory notes, no checks, no credit. Seven years ago there was no\r\nmetallic currency whatever, only banknotes, depreciated till a peso\r\n(normally worth fifty cents) would hardly pay carfare. During that\r\ntime the banking business was all but wiped out, and bankable paper\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nYet back of that period, in turn, was the time of Diaz, when paper\r\nmoney was as good as gold, and the ordinary processes of exchange\r\nwent on as in any civilized country. Diaz had found, when he came to\r\npower, a condition similar to that which exists to-day, with only\r\nmetallic currency in circulation. He brought in a new financial régime,\r\nestablishing sound banks, which under government control issued paper\r\nmoney. In 1910, the circulating medium of the country was $150,000,000,\r\nof which $65,000,000 was banknotes, accepted on an absolute parity\r\nwith the $85,000,000 of gold and silver. This money was, as noted,\r\nsupplemented by active bankable paper circulating freely in business.\r\nTo-day, by contrast, the government admits that there is less than\r\n$50,000,000 (I personally think it is very much less) of gold and\r\nsilver money in the country--to transact the business (on a cash basis)\r\nof nearly 15,000,000 people!\r\n\r\nThe loss of $100,000,000 of the circulating medium of the country (to\r\nmake no estimate of the loss and inconvenience due to the destruction\r\nof credit) is the work of the revolutions of the past eleven years.\r\n\r\nIt was Carranza who started the paper money orgy. In the course\r\nof three years he issued probably 2,000,000,000 pesos of paper\r\ncurrency--the exact records, if kept, have never been made public.\r\nThrough this means he destroyed the confidence of the public in paper\r\nmoney, and ultimately, when he came to full power, wiped out of\r\nexistence the whole system of Banks of Issue established by Diaz.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Carranza paper money was issued in Chihuahua, and was\r\naccepted at its face value. Diaz had taught the people, down to the\r\nhumblest peon, to accept paper money, and the bayonets of the Carranza\r\ntroops convinced any who doubted the quality of the new issue. It was a\r\ngood scheme for financing a revolution--till Villa drove Carranza out\r\nof Chihuahua and declared Carranza money worthless and its possession\r\na political crime. Now Villa money was issued, and was forced upon the\r\npeople at the points of new bayonets, and as the various chieftains\r\nchased each other over the country the money of the towns fluctuated\r\nwith the identity of the conqueror. Metallic currency disappeared\r\ncompletely and the value of paper money fell by jolts to a few centavos\r\non the peso.\r\n\r\nThese were the days when men who were paid in American money lived like\r\nkings. House rent was fifty cents a month; light, gas and water cost\r\na dime. You could travel hundreds of miles in a Pullman for a dollar,\r\nand settle all your old debts for two per cent of the original figure.\r\nFood prices went up, of course, and the natives, mostly paid in the\r\ndepreciated paper, suffered terribly. Starvation followed in waves, and\r\nthe mortality in the cities was appalling.\r\n\r\nThe value of paper money fluctuated over night, and after closing hours\r\neach day, there was a scampering of merchants to sell the currency\r\ntaken in during the day. They bought New York drafts, worn American\r\nbills, diamonds, carriages and real estate, at prices whose rise could\r\nnot possibly keep up with the fall in the value of paper money.\r\n\r\nEarly in the excitement Carranza had begun to repudiate his various\r\nissues of currency. The reason given was a real one--that they were\r\nbeing counterfeited everywhere, a process simple enough, for the\r\noriginal issues were themselves crudely printed on ordinary paper. At\r\nfirst the Carrancistas had attempted to keep up with the avalanche of\r\ncounterfeits by requiring that all paper money on hand in banks, stores\r\nand private tills be submitted regularly for inspection. Not even the\r\ngovernment “experts” could tell the bad from the good, however, and\r\nthey ended by declaring all of the money submitted by their political\r\nfriends to be all right, and confiscating, as counterfeit, a large\r\nand fixed percentage of that owned by men of doubtful “loyalty.”\r\nThe process did not tend to increase the public confidence in the\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe final issues of Carranza revolutionary paper money came from\r\nVera Cruz in 1915. This money alone was recognized as a part of the\r\nCarranza government obligation, and $8,000,000 was set aside in the\r\nCarranza financial plans for its redemption. This last paper money,\r\nissued after Carranza was recognized by the United States, consisted\r\nof engraved notes, known as “infalsificables” or “uncounterfeitables.”\r\nThese were issued at 10 centavos on the peso, and the government was\r\npledged to “redeem” them. This is being done, but not by anything\r\nso simple as paying honest money for them (which would put them,\r\nperhaps, into general circulation). Instead, all who pay direct taxes\r\nare required to return a surtax of the face value of their taxes in\r\nthese “infalsificables.” A friend of Carranza wrote that “this was a\r\nbeautifully simple and ingenious scheme.” It is that still, for those\r\nfavored ones who control the remaining supply of the notes and sell\r\nthem at advanced prices to the taxpayers who have to have them--mostly\r\nthe big foreign mining and oil companies.\r\n\r\nThe story of the paper money days in Mexico, and the fact that of the\r\nbillions issued but $8,000,000 is recognized as a just debt, may\r\nstir the indignation, and it certainly clarifies our understanding of\r\nMexico’s lost faith in her rulers. But in point of actual fact, the\r\ndestruction of the banking and credit system of the country, which was\r\na corollary of the paper money orgy, was far more terrible and cast an\r\neven more lasting blight on the standing of the government.\r\n\r\nEarly in his revolutionary career Carranza was at odds with the\r\nbanks. He considered it an unfriendly act, one “taking advantage of\r\nthe unlettered,” for the banks to use their knowledge of financial\r\nconditions to profit from the fluctuations of his paper currency.\r\nHe also found the banks “reactionary” in their refusal to use their\r\nstanding to assist him in making his money popular, and he charged\r\nopenly that the banks had “combined to discredit the government.” On\r\nhis entry into Mexico City he endeavored to coerce banking officials\r\npersonally, and jail was sometimes the boarding place of bank managers\r\nand bank presidents, when they refused to unlock the vaults to\r\ngovernment “inspection.”\r\n\r\nThe wrecking of the banking system extended over more than a year.\r\nHuerta, who preceded Carranza in the presidency, took the first forced\r\nloans of $5,000,000 from the banks, allowing them to issue new paper\r\ncurrency to cover this coin taken out. Carranza, on gaining control of\r\nMexico City, found the forced loan idea convenient, for he was in sore\r\nfinancial straits. As one chronicler has it, “Money had to be found....\r\nThe money in the banks was the only money available, and it was taken\r\nas the only way out of a very difficult situation.”[5] In its statement\r\nof debts, however, the Carranza government recognized these forced\r\nloans to a total of $20,000,000, none of which has been paid in six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe Carranza “loans” from the banks inevitably shook their credit and\r\nwith it the credit of every business man and business organization,\r\nand inevitably the credit of the Mexican government itself. Banknotes\r\ndropped in value and although they never reached the low mark touched\r\nby government paper, their fall to 75, to 50 and finally 30 per cent of\r\ntheir face value reduced in like manner the value of all bank deposits,\r\nand finally brought banking transactions to a stand-still. The process\r\nof final destruction of the banks began with the edict of September 26,\r\n1915, abolishing out of hand the Huerta concession which had allowed\r\nsome of the banks to issue additional paper currency to cover the\r\nHuerta “loans.” The banks were required to bring their reserves up to\r\nthe old basis in forty-five days, and despite the blow to their credit,\r\nthis was accomplished. On November 10, however, another Carranza edict\r\nreduced the recognized bank reserves by requiring that silver coins be\r\nestimated at their bullion, instead of their face value. This storm was\r\nweathered, in its turn, and nothing further was done for nearly a year,\r\nalthough during that time the breach between Carranza and the banks was\r\ncontinually widening.\r\n\r\nAn edict of September 15, 1916, required that the banks should have\r\nin their vaults within sixty days enough gold and silver to redeem at\r\npar every banknote which they had in circulation, currency which had\r\nbeen issued under concessions allowing a banknote circulation twice\r\nthe total of the bank reserves in metal and bankable paper. The decree\r\nalso prohibited the banks from doing business with the public until\r\nthe conditions set down were fulfilled. In other words, liquidation\r\nof notes and deposits was stopped, and the life blood of banking, the\r\nactive turning over of funds in the course of business, was cut off.\r\nFinally, on December 14, 1916, the _coup de grace_ was given, and the\r\nbanks were officially closed to all business excepting the collection\r\nof bills receivable in the depreciated currency of the banks themselves.\r\n\r\nThus by a series of cumulative blows the whole Mexican national banking\r\nsystem which had been built up under Diaz was destroyed utterly. At\r\nthe time the final blow was given, banknotes were accepted at about 30\r\nper cent of their face value, and had apparently reached stability.\r\nBankers assure me that had they been allowed to operate, even under\r\nthe conditions then prevailing, they could eventually have pulled\r\nthemselves and much of the business of the country out of the hole. It\r\nis also interesting to remember that the franchises of the Banks of\r\nIssue were to expire in 1922, time sufficient, under careful government\r\nleadership, for them to wind up their affairs and furnish a solid\r\nfinancial basis for the erection of some new form of national currency.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican governments, one after the other, have lent what prestige\r\nthey had to a proposed and elaborate new banking law, based on a\r\n“Sole Bank of Issue.” From Carranza’s time the men in charge of the\r\ngovernment finances apparently believed that this system could be\r\nestablished on the wrecks of the ruined Banks of Issue. Up to the\r\npresent this has not yet been attempted, for Mexico was and is in no\r\nmood to receive any form of paper currency or government banking,\r\nhowever it may be guaranteed.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable, after the banks were closed, that the country should\r\ngo back to a metallic basis. This was made more difficult, however, by\r\nthe government’s decree, recently reiterated in the summer of 1921,\r\nmaking illegal the circulation of American silver and banknotes. This\r\nplan, although it brought out the Mexican gold and silver which had\r\nbeen hoarded, inevitably cut down the circulating medium of the country\r\nto absolutely inadequate proportions, even though American money could\r\neasily have been obtained to provide enough currency to tide over the\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nThere were many difficulties connected with the establishment of gold\r\nand silver again, but most of them had to do with the scarcity of\r\nthese mediums. There was a further complication for which no one was\r\nresponsible. This was the phenomenal rise in the price of silver during\r\nthe Great War. This early became a crisis, for first the silver pesos\r\nbecame more valuable as bullion than the fifty cents (American money)\r\nat which they had been fixed in the time of Diaz, and soon even the\r\nsubsidiary coins, of a lower silver content, became worth more than\r\ntheir legal value in gold. The export of silver coins had to be stopped\r\nby government order, and under the guidance of American monetary\r\nexperts the recoinage of silver in smaller pieces was begun. To-day\r\nthis money is in general circulation, accepted at face value for the\r\nsimple and deliberately created reason that it is issued only as the\r\ncrying demands of business for change force it out. The new pesos are\r\nabout half the bullion value of the old, and the subsidiary coins are\r\neven less valuable in proportion.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this change in the size of the silver coins had an\r\nunfavorable effect on the public mind, already on edge over the various\r\nfinancial coups of the Carranza government. This was aggravated by a\r\ndestructive form of favoritism by which a few men were allowed, under\r\nCarranza, to buy up and export the old silver coins, a form of graft\r\nwhich amazes and disgusts the observer and also, be it noted, made the\r\nmoney shortage greater and less easy to endure.\r\n\r\nThe ruin of the economic structure of Mexico lies bare for any one\r\nto see, and beneath it is the rotted structure of the old financial\r\nsystem. The closing of the banks, the destruction of credit, the\r\nshutting off of the relief which might have been given by the use of\r\nAmerican currency, seem at the root of most of the ills which then\r\nbeset Mexico, because they are at the root of the lack of faith of the\r\npeople and their fear of the caprices of the morrow. For instance,\r\nto-day in Monterey, the great industrial center of northern Mexico,\r\nthere are no banks save two private houses where money can be left on\r\ndeposit, and a few exchange offices. Where, in 1910, the four Banks\r\nof Issue had more than $10,000,000 out in industrial, mining and\r\nfarm loans, there is hardly as much as $250,000 loaned to-day, and\r\nthat is by American banks on the border. The safe commercial paper\r\nwhich circulates in Northern Mexico is checks on American banks. The\r\ndrafts of strong mining and oil companies form the chief basis of\r\nmoney transfer, and are shipped from place to place all over Mexico.\r\nOptimists call this a peaceful penetration of American credit into\r\nMexico, and so it is, but all that can be done from outside of Mexico\r\nis but a drop in the bucket compared with her financial needs. Credit\r\nwithin and without must be established, and that is a problem which\r\nrests with Mexico alone.\r\n\r\nTo understand at all the mountain of distrust which looms before her,\r\nit is necessary to set down, briefly, the condition of the Mexican\r\nforeign debt.\r\n\r\nThe external government debt is $173,000,000, and on this interest\r\nhas been defaulted for more than eight years, a total of $50,000,000\r\nremaining unpaid. The internal national debt is $67,000,000 and the\r\ndefaulted interest $20,000,000. State and other debts (save railroads),\r\nwhich have been guaranteed by the government are $33,000,000 and\r\n$10,000,000 in interest.\r\n\r\nThe bonds of the National Railways of Mexico, guaranteed by the Mexican\r\ngovernment, total $239,000,000, the interest defaulted being about\r\n$75,000,000.\r\n\r\nWith other items, and counting alone the debts guaranteed by the credit\r\nof the government, these obligations total $603,000,000, and the unpaid\r\ninterest thereon is over $155,000,000. Unguaranteed state and city bond\r\nissues, the $20,000,000 recognized as due the banks for “loans,” and\r\n$8,000,000 with which to redeem outstanding fiat currency bring the\r\ntotal up to a principal of $779,120,915. Nearly eight hundred million\r\ndollars, and defaulted interest to nearly two hundred million!\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, and government after government, treasury officials\r\nhave come to New York to arrange for the refunding of this debt. The\r\nplan is usually for New York bankers to loan Mexico $300,000,000,\r\nrefund the whole debt, eliminating some items (notably by a reduction\r\nof the bond issue of the railroads) and take as security the Mexican\r\ngovernment’s pledge of a portion of the customs duties.\r\n\r\nThe answer to this proposition has been astonishingly to the point.\r\nNo Mexican guarantee of customs receipts has interested the bankers\r\nunless it was backed by the United States government, presumably with\r\na collection agency of American marines, as in Haiti and Honduras\r\nto-day. The most interesting development in answer to the Mexican\r\nsuggestions of refunding was the appointment of one of the most\r\nimpressive international banking committees ever created some three\r\nyears ago. This was headed by J. Pierpont Morgan and announced that its\r\npurpose was “the protecting of the holders of securities of the Mexican\r\nrepublic and of the various railway systems of Mexico and generally\r\nof such other enterprises as have their field of action in Mexico.”\r\nIt would seem that the probity of the Mexican government, both as to\r\nits debts and as to its willingness to repay the losses of foreign\r\ninvestors was slightly under suspicion in the financial circles of the\r\nworld, a suspicion which is shared by no other Latin-American country\r\nsave those in actual and admitted bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] E. D. Trowbridge. _Mexico Today and Tomorrow_, p. 198.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                 OUR BILL AGAINST REVOLUTIONARY MEXICO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American after-dinner orator roars his boast of “two billions\r\nof American dollars in Mexico” and moans his claim of “a billion of\r\ndamage” done to those pioneer American dollars. Whereupon the Mexican\r\n(of whatever political complexion) wails protest that three-quarters\r\nof those American dollars were made out of Mexico herself, and our\r\nState Department, which alone might clarify the matter, perforce keeps\r\nsilence. Up to the present time few have attempted to bridge the gulf\r\nbetween the orator and the Mexican and no one that gulf between the\r\norator and the State Department. We live in an age of “convictions” and\r\nwe choose our figures according to our beliefs.\r\n\r\nFifteen years ago an American consul in Chihuahua, Marion Letcher,\r\nwrote a report in which he estimated (frankly without figures) that the\r\ntotal foreign investments in Mexico were $1,641,054,180, distributed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nAmerican      $1,057,770,000\r\nBritish          321,302,800\r\nFrench           143,446,000\r\nVarious          118,535,380\r\n              --------------\r\nTotal         $1,641,054,180\r\n\r\nThese figures have been assailed, especially as regards the\r\ncomparatively small sum alloted to the British, but they remain to this\r\nday the only official estimate available. I have, however, been able\r\nto find another compilation, worked out also by Americans, but this by\r\nthe research departments of several large banking groups, with full\r\naccess to all Mexican government figures and to the stock books of most\r\nof the great American companies. The total, which is for 1914, before\r\nthe vast bulk of the investment in oil, is almost identical, but the\r\ndistribution is startlingly different:\r\n\r\nAmerican                 $655,000,000\r\nBritish                   670,000,000\r\nFrench                    285,000,000\r\nGerman                     75,000,000\r\nSpanish, Dutch, etc.      190,000,000\r\n                        -------------\r\nTotal                  $1,875,000,000\r\n\r\nThese figures claim to include the foreign investment in the National\r\nDebt of Mexico and are said to estimate the actual distribution,\r\nas far as can be worked out, of the holdings of the securities of\r\nall companies operating in Mexico. Consul Letcher’s figures were\r\nconceivably based largely on the nationality of the corporations alone.\r\nOn the other hand, Europe contributed more than half the invested\r\ncapital of such important groups as the National Railways of Mexico,\r\nmade up of companies which were all incorporated under American laws.\r\n\r\nWhen this new compilation of investment distribution first came to\r\nmy hands, I was, I may admit, inclined to “split the difference.” As\r\ncareful a study of the American investment field as it is possible to\r\nmake has, however, convinced me that the new figures are much more\r\nnearly correct than those of Consul Letcher with one exception. I\r\ndo not believe that they include all the American investment in the\r\nMexican government, state and municipal bonds held abroad.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, neither Consul Letcher’s figures nor the other\r\ncompilation represent the actual full value of American investments in\r\nMexico at the fall of Diaz in 1911. It is important that this fact be\r\nremembered because by that date the moneys which had gone into Mexico\r\nfor foreign enterprise had increased many fold through the energy\r\nwhich went with them and pushed them forward to success. I believe\r\nthat the original American investment had grown, by 1911, to fully\r\n$2,000,000,000, but in order to be absolutely just from the Mexican\r\nviewpoint we can discuss the damages on the basis of the actual cash\r\ninvested--the loss, incidentally, looms even greater. On the other\r\nhand, we must not forget that however the Mexicans may claim that the\r\nincrease in values represents an “exploitation” of their country’s\r\nresources, the concomitant advance in all values throughout the land\r\nin the era of Diaz was almost entirely the direct result of those same\r\nforeign enterprises.\r\n\r\nFrom many sources, including of course the two authorities which have\r\nbeen quoted, I have estimated the American investment of actual cash\r\ncapital and have set against it the losses in actual physical damage\r\nand in ruined business, since 1910, as follows:\r\n\r\n         AMERICAN CAPITAL IN MEXICO\r\n\r\n                          Original      Physical        Actual\r\n                         Investment      Damage         Losses\r\nRailroads               $150,000,000   $30,000,000    $60,000,000\r\nOil                      200,000,000     5,000,000    100,000,000\r\nMines                    200,000,000    15,000,000    100,000,000\r\nLands and cattle          50,000,000    10,000,000     20,000,000\r\nIndustries and public\r\nservice                   50,000,000    10,000,000     20,000,000\r\n                        ------------   -----------   ------------\r\nTotal                   $650,000,000   $70,000,000   $300,000,000\r\n\r\nDamage claims aggregating $500,000,000 are said to have been filed with\r\nthe American State Department, but no official confirmation of this has\r\never been forthcoming. However, the claims which Americans have against\r\nMexico, whether filed in the State Department or not, must be divided\r\ninto two categories, the actual and the potential damage, and perforce\r\nincludes also the claims due for loss of life and personal damages.\r\n\r\nThe actual harm already done includes: physical damage to property;\r\nunwarranted and illegitimate taxes which approach confiscation;\r\ndestruction of property values through such taxation and through the\r\nprevalence of banditry; destruction of property values by the driving\r\nout of stable government; destruction of the financial and credit\r\nsystem of the country through government decrees and repudiations;\r\nlosses in legitimate profits which would have been made during the\r\nrecent eras of high prices; actual loss in market value of property\r\nthrough the estrangement of the foreign capital which alone, in Mexico,\r\npresents a reliable buying element; destruction of property values\r\nthrough the exile of the foreigners who formed the industrious and\r\ncapable organization which maintained those values.\r\n\r\nThe potential damages are chiefly those which come from the fact that\r\nthere hangs over all foreign property in Mexico to-day, and has hung\r\nfor five years, a sword of Damocles in the threatened confiscation\r\nof such property under the radical “nationalization” plans of the\r\nrevolutionary governments. These, briefly, provide that: foreign\r\ncorporations and individuals are incompetent to own property in Mexico\r\nunless they renounce their citizenship and appear only as Mexicans\r\nbefore the Mexican law; the government may appropriate all large\r\ntracts of land, giving in return unguaranteed state agrarian bonds of\r\nvirtually no value; the government may “nationalize” the oil in the\r\nground, making it subject to the denouncement of any one, whether the\r\nproperty owner or not, when the whole oil-producing organization of\r\nMexico to-day is founded on the principle of the oil belonging to the\r\nland itself; no foreigners, under any conditions, may own any land\r\nwithin sixty miles of the frontier or thirty miles of the seacoast.\r\n\r\nLastly, and in a group by itself, are the damage claims arising from\r\nthe killing of nearly 600 American citizens in Mexico since the Madero\r\nrevolution began in 1910. The claims for these outrages and for the\r\nmaiming and raping of many hundreds more occupy a class by themselves,\r\nand will, we may confidently believe, be the first which will be paid\r\nwhen Mexico returns to the ways of civilization.\r\n\r\nJust here we can imagine the official Mexican “press department”\r\npreparing to state that “Mexico has always paid her bills, including\r\nall damage claims.” This, however, is not quite literally true. She\r\nhas paid foreign damage claims at the muzzles of foreign cannon, to\r\nbe sure, and President Diaz, in that long rule which many call “the\r\nanomaly of Mexican history” paid all the bills presented to him. But\r\nthe only “convention” which ever sat to adjudicate American damage\r\nclaims was hardly the success that would justify any such sweeping\r\nassertion of Mexico’s probity. In 1840, after years of turmoil,\r\nand after a show of force, President Jackson called a convention of\r\nAmericans and Mexicans together to consider American damage claims.\r\nThey sat from 1840 to 1842, allowed $2,000,000 in damage claims,\r\nrejected $1,000,000 and when they adjourned left $3,000,000 still to\r\nbe considered. Under an arrangement of twenty installments, Mexico\r\npaid three and defaulted the rest. The cash was paid by the United\r\nStates, and the slate was wiped clean after the Mexican war of 1847-48.\r\nFinally, this war, which as schoolboys we were taught to regard as a\r\nsort of “blot on the national escutcheon” was the result of continued\r\noutrages to Americans and continued diplomatic jockeyings with an Uncle\r\nSam who even then was much the same model of patience which he is\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nIn the public discussion of the damage which has been done to American\r\nproperties in Mexico, there has been much emphasis on the potential\r\nharm from the so-called “socialistic” or “bolsheviki” tenets of the new\r\nMexican constitution. There have been vast, crippling losses, yet it\r\nseems as if most of what we have heard has been the things which will\r\nhappen if Mexico is allowed to proceed along her present road. There is\r\nreason enough for this fear and for this emphasis, and one of the great\r\nbattles being fought in the world to-day is that which these Americans\r\nare putting up not alone for themselves but for the very principles of\r\nproperty rights. But so far Mexico and particularly the wily gentlemen\r\nwho have occupied the Mexican presidential chair have always tried to\r\nget all they could and have often carried the mis-named “American”\r\nbluff to astonishing lengths--but have almost as often retired when\r\nthe game turned against them. They have used the potential damage as a\r\nmeans of extracting an increasing toll of taxes and of loot, and for\r\nlittle else, as yet.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter I am, as already mentioned, intentionally avoiding\r\ntaking these “potential damages” into consideration. I feel that we\r\nmust have, as a starting point, a comprehensible picture of what has\r\nalready actually happened to American investments in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMost of the American money in Mexico went to that country during the\r\nthirty-four years of Diaz rule. This period was marked not by blind\r\nadoration of the foreigner, as the revolutionists now state, but by\r\na sane and far-seeing realization that foreign capital must come\r\nto Mexico if her national and economic potentialities were to be\r\ndeveloped. Foreigners were encouraged generously by laws recognizing\r\nthe privileges of pioneers in protection and in assistance in the form\r\nof exemption from taxes during their development period (the term\r\nwas usually for ten years). The idea was to allow them to import\r\nmachinery without duties and get on their feet as quickly as possible.\r\nPractically none of these companies was given land, for there is no\r\nvacant Mexican government land worth having.\r\n\r\nThe first and the greatest American corporations to enter Mexico were\r\nthe railroads. These held concessions, made according to law, but\r\nMexico had profited by the American government’s experience with its\r\ntrans-continental lines, and the subsidies and grants were small indeed\r\ncompared with those given to our Union Pacific, for instance. It is\r\nworth noting also that there have never been such scandals as our great\r\nrailroads reveled in, and that virtually every cent was invested in the\r\nlines themselves. The Mexican railway companies which were consolidated\r\nin 1907 into the National Railways of Mexico were never paying ventures\r\nfor the builders, and until the merger few dividends had ever been\r\npaid by any of the lines. For about four years following the merger\r\nconditions improved greatly, but in 1912 troubles began, and by 1913\r\nall was chaos and destruction.\r\n\r\nFrom then on to to-day, the story of the railways of Mexico has been\r\na tragic romance. It can be reduced to figures, necessarily cold in\r\nthe telling, but every figure the result of dramatic and crushingly\r\nrealistic incident. The National Railways of Mexico, a property worth\r\nover $250,000,000 as a physical plant alone, was taken over by the\r\nCarranza government on December 4, 1914, and since that time the\r\nbondholders have received no cent of interest and the physical property\r\nhas been crushed and battered and all but destroyed. On January 1 of\r\n1921 over $75,000,000 of back interest was unpaid and the defaulted\r\npayments on fixed charges is still piling up at the rate of $1,000,000\r\na month, while the Mexican government is collecting from the operating\r\ncommission $1,500,000 a month--a sum set by Carranza for the commission\r\nto turn in by any means available, as higher rates, scrimping on\r\nrepairs, deterioration in upkeep.\r\n\r\nThe confiscation of the railway properties by the Mexican government\r\nunder Carranza is one of the most astonishing and illuminating\r\npages in the whole story of Carranza’s campaign against capital and\r\nthe foreigners. But although it began with him, it apparently has\r\ncontinued into the rule of his successors--for they seem a part of\r\nthe revolution of which he was and still is the dominating, sinister\r\ngenius. Under the terms of the merger of 1907, the Mexican government\r\nwas given the voting power--but not the title to--50 per cent of the\r\nstock of the company, under certain definite conditions laid down by\r\nthe bondholders. This 50 per cent interest represented no capital\r\ninvested, nor was it a recognition of any debt which the railways\r\nmight have imagined they owed the government. It was given outright in\r\nconsideration of one thing, the guaranteeing by the Mexican government\r\nof a return of 4 per cent interest on the bonds of the merged lines. To\r\nthe merger the government contributed nothing of tangible value--save\r\none short line of railway worth about $5,000. Its permission was\r\nneeded, perhaps, for the transfer of the railway concessions to the\r\nmerger, but this would probably have been given without question had it\r\nbeen asked alone. The interests back of the merger believed that the\r\nMexican government guarantee of the interest on the bonds was worth\r\nthe gift of the voting right of half the common stock--and on this\r\nunderstanding alone it was given.\r\n\r\nThe taking over of the physical property by the Mexican government\r\nfollowed the American occupation of Vera Cruz in 1914, and shortly\r\nafterwards Carranza made his claim official, on the ground of the 50\r\nper cent voting right! On the basis of this right alone the Mexican\r\ngovernment to-day holds control of the National Railways of Mexico,\r\na right once given on the solemn guarantee of the interest on the\r\nbonds--which has not been paid for eight years--and with the recognized\r\nprovision that the bondholders should name the president of the lines,\r\nand various officials and members of the board--and to-day there is\r\nnot one official who is not a creature of the government which happens\r\nto be in power in Mexico!\r\n\r\nUpon such a basis rests the title of the Mexican government to the\r\nNational Railways. The subsidies paid by the Diaz government in years\r\ngone by for construction were given as the subsidies were given to the\r\nAmerican railways which crossed the prairies to the Pacific coast--to\r\nmake such construction possible in recognition of their benefit to the\r\ncountry. The Mexican subsidies were less than those given to the Union\r\nPacific by the United States government and not one touch of scandal\r\n(such as marked our own railway development) was ever breathed against\r\nthat of Mexico. The subsidies give no tangible claim to the lines--and\r\nas far as I know have never been advanced as a claim. The only hold\r\nof Mexico over those properties is the shadowy title conveyed by the\r\nvoting right of a block of stock given voluntarily by the bondholders\r\nin return for guarantees which have been thrown to the winds for these\r\neight years.\r\n\r\nIn the period since the government has had control of the lines,\r\nthe physical property has deteriorated to a point where only the\r\nmagnificently solid work done by the American builders to-day holds\r\nthem together. Operated by the Mexicans, with former firemen as\r\ngeneral superintendents and minor native clerks as high officials, the\r\nproperties went their way of slow destruction in the days of Carranza.\r\nSince that time, the turnover of railway officials has eliminated many\r\nof the employees who were trained under the American executives of the\r\nDiaz and Madero time, and to-day the roads are in the hands of men who\r\nlearned all they know of the railway business from those who in their\r\nturn had gleaned their little knowledge from their American chiefs--now\r\ngone from Mexico eight years. The result is a ruin comparable to\r\nnothing, probably, but the ruin of railway properties in Russia to-day.\r\n\r\nOf the more than 800 locomotives owned in 1914, only 333 (by the\r\nnotoriously inaccurate Mexican government figures) are said to be\r\nrunning. The rest lie at the bottoms of cañons or are rusting in\r\nbanks of hundreds in shop yards, as I have this year seen and counted\r\nover 100 in the one yard of Monterey. The freight cars have decreased\r\nfrom 18,000 to 7,000, and usable passenger cars are virtually unknown\r\noff the main lines to-day--all were wantonly destroyed in the early\r\nrevolution or stolen and converted into dwelling-places for “deserving\r\nrevolutionaries.” Three-quarters of all the bridges on the 8,000 miles\r\nof line are damaged, dozens of them beyond repair, thanks to the\r\ndiabolical perfection of the methods of destruction used by various\r\nMexican patriots. The tie replacements are seven years behind; nearly\r\n20,000,000 are needed, worth over $17,000,000. Other items in the\r\n$80,000,000 replacement bill are $30,000,000 for cars, $12,000,000 for\r\nlocomotives and $4,000,000 for rails.\r\n\r\nThis loss has been the result of two forms of destruction--the\r\ndepredations of the fighting factions and the cumulative destruction\r\nof neglect and failure in upkeep. Instances multiply. During one month\r\n(March, 1914) seventy trains were blown up while running at 30 to 40\r\nmiles an hour; the patriots used to connect up their dynamite with\r\nelectric batteries and then sight along two sticks from their safe\r\nretreat in the bushes and so set off the charge under whatever section\r\nof the train caught their fancy. At one time in Monterey in 1915,\r\nrevolutionary troops burned 800 loaded freight cars; their skeletons\r\nline the Monterey sidings for all the world to see, to-day. One of the\r\nlong bridges on the road to Eagle Pass, on the American border, was\r\nwrecked by running a train of loaded coke cars with two locomotives on\r\neach end out on the bridge, firing the train and blowing up the bridge\r\nwhen the burning coke had heated the steel. A similar trick on the\r\nTampico line was to take out a rail, then set fire to a train of oil\r\ncars and run it full speed on the bridge, where it was derailed and the\r\nsame process was followed as with the coke train.\r\n\r\nThe rotting of the ties on the road has left most of the branch lines\r\nall but impassable, save to the Mexican enginemen who know each bump\r\nand are quite willing to “take another chance.” The wrecked bridges,\r\njacked up on timbers, have uncomfortable and terrifying “dips.” The\r\nlist can be multiplied indefinitely. Yet perhaps the most expressive\r\nsight to be seen in Mexico to-day is those banks of rusting engines,\r\n100 in Monterey, 100 at Aguascalientes, others at San Luis Potosi,\r\nMexico City and Guadalajara. These engines were only slightly damaged\r\nwhen they were side-tracked, but through the failure of the government\r\nto furnish repair materials, they have been gradually stripped of parts\r\nto repair other engines, the brasses have been carried off and sold for\r\njunk and the whole field of ruin left like a desert waste.\r\n\r\nThere is in the Mexican railway law a provision for compensation\r\nin case the railways are taken over “for military purposes.” It\r\nis estimated that under this law the damages collectable are only\r\n$10,000,000 a year--less by $2,000,000 than the default in the fixed\r\ncharges alone. The estimated $80,000,000 of physical damage (a\r\nmere estimate until an actual valuation can be made) is presumably\r\ncollectable. The bill of the railroads is, however, as follows:\r\nPhysical losses, $80,000,000; defaulted interest to June, 1921,\r\n$75,000,000; total, $155,000,000. It is believed that about one-third\r\nof the bonds are held by Americans, so that their loss is over\r\n$50,000,000. In addition, there has been an individual loss in the\r\ndisposal of the bonds by small holders, at sacrifices as great as 80\r\nper cent. It is even said that the Carranza government had hopes of\r\nbeing able to buy up the railway bond issue when its administrative\r\npolicies had reduced the quotations to less than 30 per cent of\r\npar. Only the lack of money prevented this coup for real government\r\nownership, it is said.\r\n\r\nIn the above, I have treated only with the National Railways of Mexico.\r\nOutside of this system the only important lines in Mexico are the\r\nMexican Railway (British owned) which has now been returned to the\r\nstockholders but without compensation for damages and the Southern\r\nPacific in Mexico (American owned). The former suffered severe physical\r\ndestructions, but the latter’s bill for damages, while heavy, sinks\r\ninto relative insignificance.\r\n\r\nIn the confines of a general study, space can not be given to the\r\nsidelights on the Mexican railway situation--a situation almost\r\nTeutonic in its colossal blunders, splendidly American in the elements\r\nwhich have gone to save it from utter wreck. The long years of patient\r\nrailway building, the hundreds of miles of rock-ballasted lines across\r\nunproductive wastes, all done under American management, gave Mexico\r\na system which has held together despite the wreckage of bandits\r\nand the ravages of time and neglect. The traffic of the nation moves\r\nto-day, not in the wheezy trains which the Mexicans maintain, but\r\noverwhelmingly in a system of privately owned locomotives and cars\r\noperated by the American mining and trading companies at staggering\r\nexpense. Their 100 locomotives, in perfect repair (kept so in their own\r\nshops) and their nearly 3,000 freight cars probably represent half of\r\nthe railway equipment running on the National Railways to-day, and they\r\nprobably carry far more than half the freight. They pay full freight\r\nrates in addition to furnishing the trains, and although much of this\r\nequipment has been taken over by the government as this is written, it\r\nis no exaggeration to say that but for these American companies and\r\ntheir magnificent efforts to save what is to be saved of their Mexican\r\nproperties Mexico would to-day be stagnant,--a land of chaos comparable\r\nonly to the period of fifty years ago, before Diaz ruled.\r\n\r\nThe great oil business of Mexico owes its existence primarily to\r\nAmerican enterprise. Of the $300,000,000 of cash invested in the oil\r\nfields, $200,000,000 is American. To-day, even after the colossal\r\nproduction during the war, only a small portion of this investment has\r\nbeen recovered, for only two purely Mexican companies, the Mexican\r\nPetroleum (American) and the Eagle (British) are paying dividends. The\r\noil business in all lands is so speculative that its returns are quoted\r\nnot as “dividends” or “interest,” but as “recovery,” for until the\r\ngreat investment in drilling, tanks, pipe lines, refineries and ships\r\nis got back, there is no surety that the venture itself will prove\r\nprofitable. For this reason the losses of the oil companies through\r\nthe Mexican revolutions can be only an estimate. From sources which I\r\nhave been able to reach, I place the actual physical losses at about\r\n$5,000,000 for the American companies. This seems like a very small\r\nitem, but it does not count the failures of most of the 300 companies\r\nwhich have put money into Mexican oil or the vast sums paid in taxes\r\nor lost through oppression. Nor does it take into consideration the\r\npotential losses if Mexico enforces her “nationalization” plan. These\r\nlast would be legitimately included here, for as I say, they jeopardize\r\nthe “recovery” of the investment still remaining unpaid for, and\r\nMexican oil stock quotations have suffered as a result. Mexico still\r\nthreatens to enforce the provisions of the new constitution which\r\nmake oil the property of the nation and its exploitation a matter of\r\nconcession, like gold and silver. The oil companies are fighting this\r\nplan, for they entered Mexico and invested millions in oil lands and\r\nleases from individuals (no land was ever given them) under a mining\r\nlaw which left coal and oil the property of the owner of the land,\r\nunlike gold and all other minerals.\r\n\r\nThe actual bill of our oil companies includes, as the chief single\r\nitem, a $2,000,000 loss due to the Battle of Ebano, fought over\r\nAmerican property in the spring of 1915. Oil, tanks, pipe lines and\r\nrefinery buildings were destroyed, a single cannon ball igniting a tank\r\ncontaining 850,000 barrels of oil, all of which was burned. The item\r\nof direct thievery (largely by federal troops) is only about $300,000,\r\nbut petty destruction, murderous assaults, the killing of a score of\r\nvaluable employees and the tribute to bandits and federal “generals”\r\npile the total up. Tribute has been levied, first by the federal\r\nCarrancistas, and from January, 1915, to March, 1920, by Manuel Pelaez,\r\nthe former rebel leader, to a total of about $2,000,000, Pelaez’s\r\nfigure being a regular $30,000 a month up to his joining the successful\r\nObregon revolution in 1920 and so becoming a “federal.”\r\n\r\nThe ravaging of the oil wells is full of picturesque and terrible\r\nincident, like the railways. The most striking and costly was the\r\noutrage perpetuated by General Candido Aguilar, son-in-law of Carranza.\r\nOn December 13, 1913, Aguilar demanded, from the Eagle Oil Company\r\n(British) tribute to the sum of $10,000. This was not forthcoming\r\nso Aguilar proceeded to carry out his threat of “shutting in” the\r\ngreat “El Portrero” well, one of the most famous in Mexican oil\r\nhistory, which had been a steady producer, for two and a half years,\r\nof 30,000 barrels per day. He succeeded in capping it, and before the\r\ncasing was finally blown out, the oil had broken through the ground\r\nin dozens of places, including the bed of a neighboring river. The\r\nwhole countryside was in imminent danger of a terrible holocaust if\r\nthe oil on the river flowed away and ignited, as it surely would, but\r\nby superhuman efforts this danger was averted. But all other attempts\r\nto save the oil and repair the damage were almost fruitless, and for\r\nmonths the seepage went on, until at last the well was reduced to\r\nsalt water and $20,000,000 worth of oil had been lost. This loss is\r\ntechnically British, although it is probable that the bill for damages\r\nwill fall upon the United States, for it was undoubtedly through the\r\ninstrumentality of our State Department and its emphasis of the Monroe\r\nDoctrine that Great Britain was restrained from taking action.\r\n\r\nAnother item to be noted is the great Carranza tax system which\r\ncontinued in full force into the era of Obregon and costs the oil\r\ncompanies some $4,000,000 per month. Part of this may be recognized in\r\ntime as legitimate, but it violates the letter of the franchises of\r\nmost of the companies. To this bill of claims will also be added the\r\nlosses incident to carrying out the orders of our Department of State\r\nfor all Americans to withdraw from Mexico on two occasions. Each time\r\nabout one month’s production was lost.\r\n\r\nI have noted above the far-reaching possibilities of destruction to oil\r\nproperties entailed in the “nationalization” plans. While these are\r\nin abeyance pending “investigation and legislation” the oil companies\r\nhave other drains on their resources, such as government levies for\r\ndredging the river at Tampico (while the companies’ own dredges do the\r\nwork), the requirement of special licenses to drill each well, and the\r\nvirtual curtailment of all development work outside the Tampico-Tuxpam\r\ndistrict. All add to the total loot of the revolutionists, and continue\r\nthe threat against foreign business development throughout all Mexico.\r\n\r\nAbout $200,000,000 of American money has gone into mining in Mexico.\r\nPractically all of it has been legitimate business investment, in\r\nlow grade or old abandoned bonanza properties, in mills and in\r\nsmelters--the speculative period of bonanza mining such as we have\r\nhad in our own West was passed in Mexico a century before American\r\nmoney began to flow across the Rio Grande. Our American investment\r\ncould therefore by no means be regarded as a speculative venture, and\r\nthe margin of return was relatively small--so small in fact that\r\nMexicans did not and would not now consider such mining as profitable\r\ninvestment. We are, therefore, justified in taking a serious and\r\ncalculating view of the damage done to American mining properties under\r\nrevolutionary rule.\r\n\r\nFrom sources available, I would estimate the damage done American\r\nmining properties in Mexico at $15,000,000--this is very conservative.\r\nThere has, however, been little of the wanton destruction of mines such\r\nas the Germans practiced in Northern France. One instance, however,\r\nstands out, and this was to a coal mining property in northern Mexico,\r\nthe Agujita, less than 100 miles south of Eagle Pass, Texas. In May,\r\n1913, General Jesus Carranza, brother of the president, demanded\r\n$50,000 from the manager of this property, owned by American and other\r\nforeign capital. The money was not on the ground and there was no\r\ntelegraphic communication with Mexico City, so it could not be paid.\r\nThe property was then wrecked by Carranza soldiers, several hundred\r\ncoke ovens blown up, the mines fired and flooded, buildings burned,\r\netc.,--damage estimated at $1,000,000.\r\n\r\nSome other incidents of this sort are recorded, but the largest\r\nphysical damage is indirect, due to the driving off of workers and\r\nthe murder of the American engineers, so that great mining properties\r\nwere abandoned temporarily with the result that the water came in\r\nand tremendous values in timbering and stoping have been destroyed.\r\nIn some instances the damage caused by water has mounted up to vast\r\nsums; one great mine, the Tiro General, an American property, will\r\nfor instance require $300,000 before it can be operated again. Other\r\nproperties abandoned from time to time during the years when railway\r\ntraffic was interrupted, have similar bills for repairs, and hundreds\r\nof other mines, great and small, have been kept closed through the most\r\nprofitable period mining has ever known (that during the Great War),\r\nwith vast losses, although the ore is of course still in the ground and\r\nwill some day be taken out.\r\n\r\nThe decrees and laws put into effect by the Mexican government in its\r\neffort to raise money have had a serious effect on mining. There have\r\nbeen new export taxes on metals, for instance, 5 per cent on lead,\r\ncopper and zinc, where before nothing was assessed, and in some cases,\r\nas in that of copper, definite sums per pound have been assessed,\r\nwith the result that the falling copper prices caused the closing of\r\ngreat properties like that of Cananea (American) and El Boleo (largely\r\nFrench). Silver and gold were taxed 10 per cent as against 2¹⁄₂ per\r\ncent in the old days; during the war the export of gold was prohibited\r\nand half of the value of the silver exported had to be returned\r\nto Mexico in gold. Taxes on mining claims also have been increased\r\ntremendously, so that in 1916 a group of forty-five American companies\r\nestimated for the American-Mexican commission sitting in Atlantic City\r\nthat where in 1912 they paid $96,000 in taxes on a group of claims the\r\nnew laws would have collected $569,000 and where in 1912 the export\r\ntaxes were $1,726,000, the export taxes on the same quantity of metal\r\n(if it had been taken out, which it was not) would have been $7,000,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, only high metal prices kept any mining business going\r\nin Mexico. After the armistice, hundreds of mines and all but a few\r\nsmelters were closed down, and only the high price of silver, as long\r\nas it continued, allowed those that were left to keep running. Even\r\nduring the era of high prices it was impossible for the mines which\r\nwere operating to do the development work which alone makes possible\r\nthe continued operation of mines under modern conditions.\r\n\r\nDue to taxation, heavy freight costs, scarcity of materials and of\r\nlabor, bandit raids and uncertain supplies, the science of mining in\r\nMexico thus slipped back thirty years. This, in a phrase, sums up the\r\nreason for the losses and the conditions which make it impossible\r\nfor mines to operate to-day where in times of ordered, intelligent\r\ngovernment, they were running and supporting hundreds of thousands of\r\nMexicans in comfort and peace.\r\n\r\nFigures presenting the case of the land and cattle companies are\r\nalmost impossible to obtain, for these interests have never organized\r\nas the oil and mining men have, and the only possible sources of such\r\ninformation have not been able to collect figures enough to cover the\r\nsituation. Roughly, however, it is estimated that $50,000,000 of actual\r\nAmerican money has been invested in land in Mexico, and although the\r\ntitles to the properties still remain (always subject to the proposed\r\nconfiscation of foreign property), the loss in capital invested, of\r\nlive stock and crops, can probably be placed at over $10,000,000. The\r\nland companies and individual American holders of lands have, however,\r\nbeen the greatest sufferers, perhaps, of all the interests, for the\r\nactual worth of the land they occupied was infinitesimal compared with\r\nthe value which their very presence and industry created for it.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon colonies of northern Chihuahua, near Casas Grandes, were\r\namongst the most prosperous, in a comparatively large way, of all the\r\nagricultural sections of Mexico. Here the “desert blossomed as the\r\nrose” and the American colonists, industrious and prosperous, were\r\nbecoming valuable contributors to the Mexican national wealth. All this\r\nhas been swept away, houses burned, cattle run off, men, women and\r\neven the children murdered and maltreated, and the whole enterprise all\r\nbut destroyed. The case is paralleled all over the country.\r\n\r\nMillions of dollars have been invested by Americans in tropical\r\nplantations, and some at least of the properties were of great\r\npotential value. The story of the wrecking, raiding, pillaging and\r\nmurdering on these properties would cover pages and the sums actually\r\nlost and the values destroyed by the interruption of development run up\r\ninto great totals.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the country, in Sonora, the records show the\r\nsystematic ruin of the Yaqui Delta Land and Water Co., which, beginning\r\nunder President Madero, had invested $3,000,000 in land, surveys and\r\nexperiment stations and was turning a great property worthless for\r\nanything but grazing, into a paradise of irrigated farms. Beginning\r\nwith Carranza and continuing steadily since this company’s property\r\nhas been despoiled, and by means of confiscatory legislation, new\r\ninterpretations of franchises and overwhelming taxation has been\r\nreduced to ruin and even the government franchise itself finally\r\nannulled. The Mexicans have no plans and no money to do such vast\r\ndevelopment themselves, so the destruction of this property, pushing\r\nit back to the mere value of the grazing land, was utterly wanton and\r\ndeprives Mexico of a great agricultural development of the type which\r\nshe sorely needs.\r\n\r\nIn industrial, public service, banks and other classes of investment\r\nAmerican money has been put into Mexico to a total of about\r\n$50,000,000. Most of the industrial and public service corporations\r\nare owned by foreigners in Mexico, the only exceptions being a few\r\nmanufacturing plants and undeveloped tramway and city water plants.\r\nThe majority of this capital is, however, British, French and German,\r\nAmerican money having gone into the other interests described. Much of\r\nthis industrial property has been destroyed, and the public service\r\ncorporations have been taken over by the government on various pretexts\r\nand without payment, for the money they have earned has gone into the\r\nMexican national war chest. There remains, however, the possibility of\r\ndamage claims, which in these cases can be easily established.\r\n\r\nOf the American corporations engaged in industries a typical case is\r\nthat of the Continental Rubber Company, which has invested $5,000,000\r\nin the guayule rubber business in north central Mexico. In 1910 the\r\nguayule exports of Mexico were 28,000,000 pounds, worth in the market\r\napproximately $20,000,000, and of this the Continental exported the\r\nlargest share. To-day the guayule exports are practically nothing on\r\nthe part of the companies, while the guayule shrubs on their lands are\r\nbeing cut and shipped by roving bands of bandits and peons. The vast\r\nHacienda de Cedros, covering 2,000,000 acres, was bought by the company\r\nnearly fifteen years ago, when its value was around $1,000,000. At the\r\nheight of the guayule business its worth was many times this sum, but\r\nto-day, even with the chances of a future recognition of the title of\r\nthe American company, it could not be sold for its original cost. Like\r\nall foreign properties in Mexico which have been successful, the value\r\nof this hacienda was in the industry of the Americans who owned and\r\nmanaged it--a value which cannot be estimated or set down in figures in\r\na damage claim.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Banks of Issue, the backbone of the credit system of\r\nMexico, were owned only in small part by American interests. Their\r\ndestruction and the wiping out of the entire Mexican financial system\r\nwhich was built up by Diaz, must not be forgotten in trying to get a\r\npicture of the destruction wrought by the Mexican revolutionary bandits\r\nand their governments. The paper money systems which scourged the\r\ncountry from 1913 to 1916 cost foreigners millions of dollars which\r\ncan never be shown in figures, owing to the fluctuations of the paper\r\npesos. The upsetting of credit, which those who study the situation\r\nsoon find was due largely to Carranza decrees (whether justified by\r\ncircumstances or not) has set Mexico back nearly fifty years and has\r\ndepressed values of property and investment beyond any calculation but\r\nthe most careful studies by experts in finance as well as industry.\r\n\r\nIt is such phases of the Mexican credit system of to-day which\r\nconstitute the real damage claims against Mexico--claims which\r\ncan hardly be estimated. I place the figure at $1,000,000,000,\r\nand yet its potentialities are far more than that. At the present\r\nmoment the greatest actual loss--even though it can be partially\r\nrepaired if the future develops sane government in Mexico--is in the\r\nvirtual destruction of the market for property in Mexico. The new\r\nconstitution and the decrees and laws under it virtually prohibit\r\nforeigners from owning anything in a vast restricted zone along the\r\nborder and seacoast, a zone including the richest foreign holdings\r\nin Mexico. They prohibit foreigners from owning real estate anywhere\r\nunless they agree never to appeal to their home governments in case\r\nof trouble. The effect of this is to eliminate the only possible\r\nmarket for valuable property. The Mexicans, and particularly the\r\nMexicans who are in control to-day, will not, need not, can not buy\r\nsuch properties--foreigners and the opportunities which were open to\r\nforeigners in Mexico before the revolution actually created the market\r\nvalue of such property, because they and they alone were the possible\r\npurchasers.\r\n\r\nEven well-developed small farming tracts cannot be sold to small\r\nMexican farmers--such small farmers hardly exist as a class and where\r\nthey do exist, their experience and their financial capacity do not\r\nlead them to consider the purchase of improved farms. And above all is\r\nthe promise and the performance, in some cases, of the much-heralded\r\nland distribution of the revolutionary governments. Where men can get\r\nsomething for nothing, or on their own worthless credit, they do not\r\nbuy in the open market.\r\n\r\nAside from this destruction of the values of foreign property holdings\r\nin Mexico by making transfer virtually impossible, there is, once more,\r\nthat omnipresent menace of confiscation which makes men seek privileges\r\ninstead of their as yet uncertain legal rights, for the protection\r\nof what they have. No longer do men buy to develop--they take, as in\r\nthe oil fields, only what is sure to return large profits in a very\r\nbrief time, for they know that even if they have privilege, and think\r\nthey know how to keep on having privilege for themselves, they cannot\r\ntransfer their capacity for getting privilege when they seek to sell\r\ntheir property. There are no longer relative values of property, in\r\nMexico--property is worth only what can be got out of it, and got\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nThis all makes up an uninspiring picture. But we must look on such\r\npictures, must weigh and judge them ere we can see the way through and\r\nbeyond them. That there is such a way must not be forgotten. It lies\r\nbeyond the realm of mere political reform, for to-day, as all through\r\nthe revolutionary history of Mexico the curse of the country is _the\r\napplication of political remedies to economic ills_--that phrase should\r\nbe burned into the brain of all who seek knowledge of the real Mexico.\r\n\r\nThat the relief is to come from the womb of revolution has been\r\nthe hope of all who have watched the struggles in Mexico without\r\nunderstanding them. The failure of their hopes has been continuous.\r\nMadero, Huerta, Carranza, de la Huerta, Obregon,--to each in turn\r\nhave such watchers transferred their allegiance and their faith. Each\r\nhas failed, in so far as each has applied only the political remedy.\r\nThe result has been the utter debasement of Mexican credit, the utter\r\noutraging of Mexican and foreign faith in Mexico herself. To-day, as\r\nI have said, Mexicans do not believe in Mexico, and each new failure\r\nof the political remedy sends them further away from her altars. What,\r\nthen, is the answer?\r\n\r\nThe answer is but the following of the inexorable logic of life--and\r\nof business. We shall find it, not in the application of new politics,\r\nof new (or of old) constitutions and laws and decrees, not in the\r\nravings of dreamers or of petty states-men. We shall find it, and shall\r\nknow it when we find it, in a solution of the practical problems of\r\nMexican commerce, labor and business by the practical men of affairs\r\nof Mexico and of the world. Our part shall be a very great part, for\r\nthe business men of the United States, above all others, must show the\r\nway. Mexico must in the end bow to practical ideas of practical men,\r\nand in bowing to that yoke she will see her future unfold. Of the ways\r\nof finding the road and of turning Mexico upon it, we shall deal later.\r\nOnly here, at the end of this dismal chapter of failure to solve the\r\neconomic problems by political nostrums, I wish to indicate that there\r\nis, and will be, a way of hope and of salvation--from within Mexico\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                      MEXICO AND HER “BOLSHEVISM”\r\n\r\n\r\nTen years ago Mexico was one of the great, progressive nations of the\r\nworld; to-day she is just “another Latin American Republic.” Then she\r\nshowed literally the achievement and the promise of Japan; to-day she\r\nis as backward and as hopeless as Turkey. Ten years ago her diplomats\r\nwere honored in the councils of kings, her credit ranked with that of\r\nthe best of Europe, her cities were miniatures of Paris, her mines\r\noperated with the perfection of those in England, her railways and\r\nbudding industries bore comparison with those of the United States,\r\nher people lived in arcadian peace, wakening slowly and surely, if\r\nsometimes painfully, to a civilization which was meeting their needs.\r\nTo-day, Mexico is a little worse than Turkey, a little better than\r\nHayti, her diplomats are as inconsequential as those of Thibet, her\r\ncredit is as low as that of Austria, her cities and ports are mud\r\npuddles and pest holes, her mines are back to the rat-hole workings\r\nof the colonial Spaniards and Indians, her railroads are rattling\r\nskeletons, her industries virtually non-existent. Life is again\r\narcadian, with all those discomforts of Arcadia which the poets of old\r\nand the propagandists of to-day neglect, so carefully, to mention.\r\n\r\nThe world has learned, in these past years, to take colossal\r\ndestructions calmly, so that few of us wonder and none of us really\r\nquestions the fact or the why of Mexico’s sudden and astounding\r\ndegeneration. And yet that failure is in miniature the threat and\r\nthe promise of the failure of our civilization, in epitome the boast\r\nof bolshevism and the nightmare of capitalism. Mexico is like the\r\nChamber of Horrors at the old Eden Musee or Mme. Tussaud’s, a row of\r\nilluminated pictures which tell in ghastly realism what is sure to\r\nhappen to careless people if they play too recklessly with the world\r\nwhich is given them to use.\r\n\r\nThis seems indeed a cycle of bolshevism, but it is a cycle in which\r\nradicalism, like capitalism, is a sorry victim. As a picture the events\r\nin Mexico approximate the drama in Russia, carried to the logical\r\nconclusions which such a drama would reach on any national stage where\r\npersonal aggrandizement is a mightier lodestone than public devotion.\r\nThe historical facts of the past decade in Mexico are unrelated to the\r\nfacts and background of Russia, yet in Mexico there have been heard the\r\nsame shibboleths, the same promises, the same cries of the downtrodden.\r\nThere have been seen the same red flags, the same uprisings and\r\nassassinations, and the same “redistribution” of property as in Russia.\r\nAnd more than all has unrolled the drama of the rising of obscure\r\nchieftains and politicians to colossal and wicked power. But in Mexico\r\nthe cycle has gone far beyond Russia, perhaps because here there has,\r\nindeed, been no touch of even such idealism as there may be in Moscow.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico the crimson day of bolshevism has been followed quickly by\r\nthe purple twilight of the aftermath of graft and privilege. To-day\r\nthere is to be seen there a power of wealth mightier than any which\r\nis conceivable in the now almost forgotten dawn of bolshevism’s red\r\nday in Mexico. Privilege and not the proletariat, capitalism and not\r\nsocialism, are the gods of that stricken land,--a land which ten years\r\nago was mistress of her life and of her destiny, and to-day is a beggar\r\nin the marts of the world, ready to sell her body and her soul for gold.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to force a parallel between the early events in\r\nMexico and those in Russia. The parallel is there, and could fill the\r\neye and mind with the aid of a modicum of imagination. But the facts\r\nalone are eloquent, and the primary fact is not whether the revolution\r\nagainst the czar was day for day and hour for hour a repetition of\r\nthe Madero revolution against Diaz, or whether Huerta was an Indian\r\nDenekin, or Carranza a weak Lenin or Obregon the realization of what\r\nTrotzky might be to-morrow or next year. The first fact and the last\r\nis that in one great section of Mexico we have seen and in the whole\r\nof Mexico we are to-day watching the rolling on of an ugly spiral from\r\nplutocracy to revolution, from revolution to socialism, from socialism\r\nto bolshevism and then from bolshevism to demagogy, to a later and\r\ndarker dictatorship, with a more miserable proletariat, and on into the\r\nvast sweep of an age of privilege which holds and wields power greater\r\nthan government, greater and more direct than capital or labor has ever\r\nwielded. For privilege stands alone in the midst of the smoking ruins\r\nof what was once the Mexican nation.\r\n\r\nHe braves much in this day who dares define or limit bolshevism, but\r\nin Mexico its manifestations have been carried to a point where they\r\nhave limited and defined themselves. First, Mexican bolshevism was and\r\nis the application of political remedies to economic ills; second, it\r\nis the raising up of the proletariat by promises and agitation to the\r\noverturning of established government and the setting up, not of the\r\npromised millennium, but of new dictatorships and new oppressions. Both\r\nsought, and claim, the improvement of the workers, but both have failed\r\nand faded to shadowy appearance and raucous boast.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico to-day there are spots where peace and progress reign--but\r\nthey are literally those spots where “capitalism,” entrenched behind\r\na wall of gold and foreign protection, has been able to give its\r\nworkers the value of the profits which they gain. The rest of Mexico\r\nis worse off, politically and economically, than in the days of Diaz,\r\nand increasingly the only hope of the country seems, by some means,\r\nto achieve the extension of sane business to the replacement of the\r\neconomic ruin of native demagogues masquerading behind the fair words\r\nof socialism.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the beneficent effects of this foreign business has been\r\nthe education of the Mexicans whom it touches toward broader horizons\r\nof living and personal efficiency. For actually the history of Mexico’s\r\ndownfall is a history of the failure of her education, of the failure\r\nof the past governments of Mexico to utilize the forces which were at\r\ntheir hand for the uplift and the development of the unhappy masses of\r\nthe people. That failure of the past has become a colossal catastrophe\r\nin the days of present and past revolution.\r\n\r\nFor their day and time, Spain and the Roman Catholic church did much\r\nfor Mexico. We do not know what the Church might have done if it had\r\nhad different, more educational ideals, but we do know that, save for\r\nthe work of the Protestant missions in the past thirty years, hardly\r\nany other force but Rome has done anything for social improvement\r\nin Mexico. We do not know what Anglo-Saxon educational and economic\r\nleadership would have done in the place of that of the Spaniards and\r\nmixed-bloods--such comparisons are necessarily academic. But we do know\r\nthat under the Spanish viceroys and under Diaz more was done toward\r\nimproving the material welfare and toward building the foundations of\r\nmaterial and moral prosperity for the unfortunate peons than has been\r\ndone or even sincerely attempted in the ten years of revolutionary rule\r\nsince the fall of Diaz.\r\n\r\nMexico has been, and indeed is, what we sometimes call in our brusque\r\nAmericanism, a “white man’s country.” It is essentially one of the\r\nspots in this world where the burden of uplift is the white man’s\r\nburden. For 300 years white Spaniards sought to lift it, and in that\r\nlong effort, with all its failures, they placed Mexico, even with her\r\nsix millions of unlettered, superstitious Indians, in the category of\r\nthe white lands. The duty of the white man, imperialist or socialist as\r\nhe may be, has ever been two-fold, and its duality has been its power;\r\nwe have lifted the material plane of our wards and we have upraised\r\nthose wards themselves to a higher and yet higher mental and spiritual\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nIt is this dual duty that the revolutionists of Mexico have shirked\r\nand have scouted. The economic rain of the country is to-day almost\r\ncomplete, and its spiritual uplift has been halted as by a wall of\r\nflame. From those material ruins, Mexico might conceivably rise in a\r\nspiritual rebirth, but the fact has been otherwise, for the material\r\nruin has been accomplished by the prostitution of all the ideals,\r\nall the sacred faiths of men, concentrated by self-seeking bandit\r\ngovernments to the aggrandizement and the enrichment of a few sodden\r\nfavorites.\r\n\r\nI would, if I could, paint a different picture, but the half lights of\r\nsuch a panorama can be added only after the dull background has been\r\nset in. And that background is dark indeed. The panorama of misery\r\nbegins when one crosses the northern border to-day. There the scattered\r\nbut once almost happy villages of other times have been replaced by\r\nruined, roofless railway stations lined with starving vendors of food\r\nwho fight with the bony dogs for the refuse of the very food they\r\nsell. All the long trip to Mexico City is marked by the same voiceless\r\nsuffering, and the capital itself has a dismal dinginess that cries of\r\nhopeless misery, in appalling contrast to the gallant days of the Diaz\r\n“materialism.”\r\n\r\nThe unhappy toll of war and revolution, one says? Yes, in part, for\r\nsuch “war” as Mexico has known always takes that toll and always, too,\r\nfrom the weaklings, putting starvation and sickness and filth and\r\ndismay where once were comfort and health and some cleanliness and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nBut, again the question, was it not worth the price, will it not be\r\nworth the price, in the victories won for human freedom? And here the\r\nanswer is unequivocably “No.”\r\n\r\nMany hoped, with the fine faith of their own sincerity, that the\r\nupheaval which followed Diaz was the dawning of a new era. But in\r\nthat hope even those who knew Mexico forgot the Mexicans and their\r\nhistory. Political independence from Spain had been won, freedom from\r\nthe domination of religious bigotry had been won, before Diaz came. The\r\nstruggle of his day was one of uplift, carried on with faulty tools,\r\nperhaps, but slowly reaching toward the light. Living was improving,\r\nslowly; religion was improving, slowly; education was advancing,\r\nslowly. Then came a period of crystallization; the Diaz oligarchy\r\ngrew old. Many sincere men, inside and outside Mexico, thought that\r\nthe advance could and should move more rapidly. Diaz repressed those\r\nhastening reformers, and the spiritual force which finally broke forth\r\ninto the Madero revolution of 1910-11 was undoubtedly the result of\r\nthat repression of progressive thought.\r\n\r\nLike all the revolutions of Mexico’s stormy history, this one began\r\nwith a beautiful stating of ideals and of the unrealized needs of\r\nthe common man; but as with all those other revolutions, the power\r\npassed quickly to the hands of men whose sole “ideal” was personal\r\naggrandizement, personal wealth, and ruin to all whose needs might\r\nincommode these exalted “leaders.”\r\n\r\nThe so-called “social revolution” of Mexico borrowed the battle cries\r\nof European socialism, but in the land in which it worked it stirred up\r\nonly a tempest in a teapot, with the miserable masses of the country\r\nserving as tinder and fuel beneath the vessel. The teapot is the\r\ndiminutive organized labor world of Mexico, and that is boiling more\r\nviolently, perhaps, than elsewhere. But to-day the “advanced” ideas of\r\nMexico serve, in the name of socialism, only to put sweeping power into\r\nthe hands of unscrupulous men, men who know and care nothing of the\r\nresponsibilities of power, and are using it only to the destruction of\r\nthe very bases of Mexican society.\r\n\r\nThus, while there seems to be a light dawning in the labor world of\r\nMexico, I am not sure that the light does not come from the burning\r\nof something which Mexico cannot afford to lose. In that organized\r\nlabor world there are fewer than 50,000 workers out of a population\r\nof 15,000,000, while there are more than 3,000,000 peons, heads of\r\nfamilies, who work, when there is work, in the fields, or as common\r\nlaborers. It is upon the continued, unbroken suffering of these\r\n3,000,000 that the 50,000 profit to-day--the peons have but changed\r\nmasters once again and in the name of freedom, now, serve a vaster\r\ncompany. The Mexican leaders, drawing their power in turn from the\r\ncoherent, organized industrial workers, are to-day destroying the\r\ncivilization of Diaz, and with it the civilization of American business\r\nmen, American teachers and American missionaries, which was and is the\r\nhope of the downtrodden majority. The “modern” laws which labor has\r\npromulgated might, we may conceive, fit the advanced industrial life of\r\nGermany or the United States, but they are utterly suicidal to Mexico.\r\nThe new Constitution of 1917 has written into its fabric an idealistic\r\nset of labor laws, beautiful in terminology but under present\r\nconditions of industry and psychology and government in Mexico, about\r\nas impractical for the development of industry and the true welfare of\r\nlabor as they are efficient as a means of graft and extortion against\r\nlabor as well as against employers. These laws are worked out for the\r\nsole benefit of the industrial workers of Mexico, that total of less\r\nthan 50,000 as against the 3,000,000 farm and day laborers. They are\r\nthus far more important as a propaganda document with the foreign\r\nradicals who caused the inclusion of those administrative laws in the\r\nnew national constitution than they are helpful to Mexico’s own social\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nThe eight-hour day provided in the constitution, the welfare projects\r\nsuch as the stern proviso that nursing mothers shall have two half-hour\r\nperiods per day in which to care for their children, the constitutional\r\nsupport of the right to strike even in public utilities, and the\r\nvirtual provision against the employment of strikebreakers, or the\r\nclosing of a shop in a lock-out, are typical of the privileges for\r\nlabor--they cover everything which the most radical would make the laws\r\nof every land. In Mexico, and under the peculiar conditions of Mexican\r\npsychology and inter-class relationships, they become little more than\r\ntools of the demagogues. The rulers do as they choose in any case,\r\nas when, not long ago, a railway strike was successful to the last\r\ndetail of the demands made in the name of “the social revolution” and\r\ntwo months later a similar strike for similar ends was opposed by the\r\ngeneral use of strikebreakers. The labor courts, theoretically a great\r\nadvance, are used almost without exception as a palladium of radical\r\npropaganda--and as a toll-gate on the road of privilege.\r\n\r\nSuch are the reforms of the new era. They provide six or eight hour\r\ndays, for men who cannot read and whose children are not taught to read\r\nor to think. They provide minimum wages, to be determined by factory\r\ncommittees, with the most ignorant workmen in the world on a par with\r\nemployers and industrial engineers. They provide against discharge for\r\nany cause except proven drunkenness, in a land where, to say the least,\r\ndrunkenness is relative.\r\n\r\nTheir own people have begun, a little, to wonder at the wisdom of these\r\nsweeping changes, and one, Ing. Carlos Arroyo, not long ago wrote in\r\nthe official but very radical “Bulletin of Industry, Commerce and\r\nLabor” that there were four main difficulties which would have to be\r\ncorrected before factory efficiency could be arranged in Mexico on a\r\ncoöperative basis: first, scientific method would have to replace the\r\nempirical system now in use; second, there would have to be special\r\ntraining for apprentices; third, there would have to be study of\r\nemployees to have them properly placed; fourth, the responsibility\r\nfor the tasks assigned would have to be “equally” divided (not given\r\nentirely to the workers) between the management and the workers,\r\n“because the former continues to be charged with the responsibility for\r\nthe competence of the latter.”\r\n\r\nAnd as to that competence, this same bulletin regularly publishes the\r\nrecords of accidents. There one will find that in 1918, for instance,\r\nthere were, in 278 industrial establishments having 292,364 employees,\r\n6,424 accidents, in which 184 were killed, and 42 maimed and 6,198\r\nwounded. And, most illuminating of all, 5,165 of the accidents were\r\nadmittedly due to the “carelessness of workmen,” only 195 were the\r\nfault of the management and 1,064 were due to unavoidable causes.\r\n\r\nAs to the value of the achieved reforms, I have but this to tell: In\r\nall the cities, in the centers of industry like the Tampico oil fields\r\nand the busy port of Vera Cruz (busier to-day than it has ever been\r\nbecause all Mexico must live on imported goods) I found a sullen hatred\r\nof the foreigner, an ugly self-assertion that bodes but ill for those\r\nmissionaries of religion and of business to whom we look for so much of\r\nthe future regeneration of the country. I saw none of the contented,\r\nhappy calm of prosperous laborers, but only the unrest of the great\r\ncities of other lands, ugly with resentment, fertile field for\r\nrevolution but not for progress. And yet those very resentful workers,\r\nconvinced of an unappreciated importance which they knew but by rote,\r\nare all that there is of the “fruits” of the “social revolution” in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nNo, Mexico has not changed, even amongst her petted laboring classes,\r\nand I fear that the old rule of our ancient civilization will have to\r\npersist a little longer, and the long, dim road be trod again through\r\nfailure and reform, and failure again and yet again. I fear that we\r\nshall still have to lift by reaching down and, by training the dull\r\nforces of those dull minds, teach them to help themselves and to climb\r\nby themselves.\r\n\r\nOut on the plantations the workers are going the rounds which they have\r\ncovered since Mexico began, and in the fairs I saw the only evidence of\r\nhappiness which smile on one in the length and breadth of the country.\r\nThe market places and the fairs of Mexico, sunny, crowded, colorful,\r\nrich because the Indians in the booths are close to Nature and Nature’s\r\nbounty! That simple happiness has been the source of all Mexico’s\r\njoy--and of all her misfortune. That simplicity has made her people\r\nthe dupes of predatory chieftains, and hideous priests of pre-Spanish\r\ntimes, of Spaniard and priest through the long centuries of the\r\nviceroys, of master and of some priests, too, through the years since\r\nthe Independence. Yet in those periods those who have duped the Indians\r\nhave, most of them, protected the Indians in an easy, medieval way, and\r\nslowly there has grown a civilization, and in that civilization have\r\nbeen nurtured the seeds of better things.\r\n\r\nThe time was coming for those seeds to bear fruit, when, hastening the\r\nripening, came the revolutions of 1910 and after. It was like the child\r\nwho pulled up the stalks to see how the seeds were growing--they were\r\ngrowing much faster than appeared on the surface, but they did not grow\r\nafter they were pulled up.\r\n\r\nLooking back to the Diaz day we can find, for instance, the slow,\r\nconstructive work toward the creation of arable land for small farms.\r\nIt was being hampered somewhat by grasping office-holders, but it was\r\nadvancing, a great national plan of irrigation to make possible the\r\nuse of small tracts in a country where rain conditions have forever\r\nmade small farming all but impossible. Then the revolution and the\r\nresounding cry for “land.” The alleged land hunger of the Mexican\r\nIndians and peons has been at once the rallying cry for each succeeding\r\nrevolution and the one appeal of all of them for foreign sympathy.\r\n\r\nBut whatever authorities may conceive as to the facts of the existence\r\nof this land hunger or of the forms which it takes--a desire for\r\nlittle farms, for prehistoric communal ownership, or for property only\r\nbecause it is wealth and can be converted into cash--it is also true\r\nthat the schemes of the revolutionists for land distribution have\r\nbeen impossible except by the confiscation of rich properties and the\r\ndestruction of vested rights. Obviously, no land which is not tillable\r\nis satisfactory for distribution, and the tillable land of Mexico\r\nis, as I have pointed out, actually only about 25,000,000 acres, or\r\none-twentieth of the area of the country. Land distribution must long\r\nremain largely a beautiful theory, good only for raising up the natives\r\nby direct appeal to their bitter poverty or to their human greed,\r\nand for the raising up of foreign sympathy by the flaunting of the\r\nmisfortunes of the soil under more appealing names.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico to-day all these dreams of land distribution have gone\r\nthe way of other “reforms” for the benefit of the peons. Nothing,\r\nvirtually, has been done. Some great properties have been confiscated,\r\nor “paid for” in unguaranteed bonds of bankrupt state governments, but\r\nmost of such properties are to-day in the hands of former revolutionary\r\n“generals.” Some few have been distributed to Indians, but even\r\nthese tracts are taken with but scant enthusiasm. One great “land\r\ndistribution” in Yucatan called forth a crowd of 6,000 to the festival\r\n(all Mexico goes to any _fiesta_) but only thirty Indians took up any\r\nof the hundreds of small tracts offered.\r\n\r\nThe essential facts of the Mexican situation are patent to all who\r\ngo to Mexico to-day, and they are inescapable to those who have a\r\nbackground of knowledge of Mexico by which to judge of what they see.\r\nAnd yet it is true that in the councils of Carranza, in the entourages\r\nof de la Huerta and of Obregon there have been men representing forces\r\nwhich we in our time have felt could not be used to evil purpose.\r\nThese were men who had been stirred by the fine frenzy of the first\r\nrevolution, and whose ideas, caught as mere phrases by the leaders of\r\nrevolts, were handed back to their originators again, as the “ideals”\r\nof the revolution. Strange indeed it is, and yet not only newcomers,\r\nbut foreigners of long residence and sincere and devoted Mexicans as\r\nwell, fell victims to that subtle flattery. In business, in education,\r\nin the churches, there were such men, their very hopes too great to\r\nprotect them from the petty deceits of those who climbed to power upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI think I can understand why travelers in Mexico, sincere students\r\nas well as moistily entertained excursions of American “Chambers of\r\nCommerce” can be deceived as to conditions there. I have been inclined\r\nto be impatient with those who let themselves be led this way and\r\nthat, and flattered by the apparent sincerity of self-deluding Mexican\r\nofficials, but Mexico is, after all, an eternal enigma. It is an enigma\r\nbecause its colossal depths of ignorance and the smallness of its\r\ndeceits are literally incomprehensible to simpler and less subtle minds.\r\n\r\nIt is that enigma which I have sought through all my writing on Mexico\r\nto resolve. On my last trip through the country, I saw just the eternal\r\nMexico, the Mexico of ignorance and misery, whose only change was that\r\nit was a little sadder, a little more resentful of those whom it once\r\nregarded as its helpers and its friends, a little more pompous in\r\nparading its borrowed intellectual plumage.\r\n\r\nA most perfect example of this ability of the Mexican of the “modern”\r\ntype to absorb one’s ideas and deceive one by the redishing of those\r\nideas, happened to me on my last trip to Mexico City. In the course\r\nof the preparation of an article on a great business for a popular\r\nmagazine, I met a Mexican _licenciado_ (a title of vast elegance,\r\nmeaning much more than its dictionary equivalent of “lawyer”) who was\r\nextremely anxious to be quoted as an expert on the subject which I was\r\nstudying. He evidently thought that my quoting him would help him to a\r\ngovernment post to which he aspired, so he expounded his ideas at great\r\nlength. When he was finished, I answered his arguments in kind, and\r\nwith considerable interest in his response to my counter-play. He was\r\npleasantly combative, and we parted in thorough friendship.\r\n\r\nIt was only a few hours later that I had an urgent call from this same\r\ngentleman, who had, he told me, been going into new material on the\r\nsubject, and wished to express his views, stated in the morning, more\r\ndefinitely to me. Whereupon he returned me, recooked and eloquently\r\nserved, my own friendly contentions of the previous interview. It was a\r\nbit thick for me, but it is worth the telling that an American business\r\nman of long experience in Mexico who had introduced this gentleman to\r\nme remarked when the subject came up again, a day or two later:\r\n\r\n“By the way, Licenciado Blank is getting much broader. He has figured\r\nout a pretty decent attitude on this problem ...” and he redished me my\r\nown views again!\r\n\r\nThis is Mexico to-day. On the top a group of men who have absorbed in\r\njust this way the phrases of the intelligent radicals of the world\r\nbut who still remain, as always, sycophants without background of\r\neducation, or even genuine radical convictions. Below them the vast\r\nmisery of the unthinking serfs of the country, duller, certainly sadder\r\nand even less well nourished than in the days of the viceroys and of\r\nDiaz.\r\n\r\nWe are all responsible for the Mexico which is before us. We Americans\r\nof every type in that old Mexico were too willing to let the misery\r\nof Mexico be what it was, were too willing to take our helpers and\r\nour support from the middle classes which were emerging so slowly.\r\nWe made a fetish of that middle class, built our hope of Mexico upon\r\nit, called it the crowning achievement of the age of Diaz, and from\r\nit came the beginnings of that group of Mexican leaders of which we\r\nall had dreamed. We saw Diaz clear--all of us, I think--and knew\r\nthat his day could not be forever. But we had faith in that middle\r\nclass, forgetting, as it was easy to forget, the instability of that\r\nfoundation of Indian poverty and misery. We were going to transmute\r\nthose shifting sands by making more striking the examples of its\r\nbrothers--artisans and clerks and students and teachers. We trusted\r\nso blindly, then, in the leaven of example--we knew so little of the\r\nsodden flour which made our loaves.\r\n\r\nAnd then came the day of revolution, Madero the deliverer. There were\r\nfew of us who regretted the passing of Diaz, save sentimentally,\r\nthat it should have to be in just that way--we had hoped he would\r\ndie gloriously, beloved by the people for whom he had given so much.\r\nAnd then the disappointment and the horror of that wild cabal of\r\ngraft and loot under Madero, when the dreamers, the repressed brains\r\nof a generation, stood waiting, wringing their hands in helpless\r\nimpotence--those who could, truly, have done so much! It was pitiful,\r\nas was the aftermath of Huerta, the reaction, the impossible reaction\r\nwith its ugly tinge of a coming uprush of Indian barbarism.\r\n\r\nThen Carranza, riding upon the winged horse of Madero--it seems that\r\nnot all of us understood, quite, for we heard the fair words, as\r\nwe have heard them echoing through empty halls and across dead and\r\ntortured bodies these five years since. Many sincere men were caught\r\nby those fair, echoing words, and many followed the phantom to the end.\r\nAnd many continue to this day.\r\n\r\nI have no need to talk of the recent past, nor of the present. The\r\nstory is written in the starving babies of the Mexican towns, in the\r\ndismal railway stations where wretched food can be bought (if one\r\ndares) from the very mouths of hungry, filthy vendors. Misery and grief\r\nand pain stalk in Mexico to-day. Somewhere those who have used these\r\nwretched bodies, as infinite in number, as minute in importance, as the\r\nskeletons of a coral reef, for climbing to wealth and power--somewhere\r\nthese must make answer.\r\n\r\nIn another chapter I shall tell something of the story of Yucatan,\r\nwhere the ideas of radical socialism were accepted and then used to\r\ndestroy even itself. It is a story of horror and of wreckage, the\r\nclearest picture of Mexican conditions at their ultimate which has\r\npassed in the gory panorama of the recent years.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened in Yucatan is in essence what has been going on\r\nall over Mexico. In the larger field of the whole country, the\r\nrevolutionists have been more coherent, and at the same time in their\r\nutterances somewhat more considerate of the prejudices of the world at\r\nlarge. Yucatan, isolated from the rest of Mexico, and free from the\r\nprying eyes of most of the world as well, has gone on with the round\r\nof despotism and oppression, rape and murder in the name of socialism,\r\nbut on the mainland, the “rights of labor” have been more elaborately\r\ndefended (in words) and the legal systems of confiscation and\r\nanti-foreignism have been more logically developed, under the standard\r\nof progressive socialism!\r\n\r\nThe years have written records of Mexican political and social\r\nrevolution which are identical with those of the present in all save\r\ntheir battlecries. The first outbreak against Spain in 1810 and the\r\ndozens of revolutions which followed it were a _reductio ad absurdum_\r\nof the political ideals of Thomas Paine and the American and French\r\nrevolutionaries. The Constitution of 1857, under which Diaz ruled,\r\nwas little more than a copy of the Constitution of the United States,\r\nand few of its provisions were really adapted to Mexico’s peculiar\r\nconditions. So it is not strange, perhaps, that the Constitution of\r\n1917 is as far from being Mexican and far more false an effort to solve\r\nthe nation’s problems than was its predecessor, for it was dictated by\r\nforeign radicals and merely adapted by the Mexican politicians who knew\r\nbest what would arouse enthusiasm in the Mexican crowd.\r\n\r\nDespite its beauties of theory and its direct appeal to the serious\r\nradical thought of the world, its most useful function is becoming\r\nobvious even to the most credulous, for it gives the governing groups\r\nthat control of Mexican life by which it is possible for them to\r\nsell the privilege of doing business, because the ancient rights of\r\nbusiness are utterly done away with. The ills of Mexico are essentially\r\neconomic, and the new constitution and its revolutions, even more than\r\ntheir predecessors, have sought to apply only the political remedy, a\r\nremedy which has so far served only to destroy the efficiency of the\r\neconomic machinery of the country and place it upon the auction-block\r\nof graft.\r\n\r\nTo-day all over Mexico, labor is paid higher wages than it ever\r\nreceived, but it is paying more for its food and shelter than it\r\never spent before. The misery of Mexico is just as obvious and as\r\nunescapable as ever to him who sees truly. Save for those sections\r\nwhere foreign business still survives the Mexican lives as he has\r\nalways lived, on the verge of pauperism. And upon the summit of the\r\nheap, lounging in easy magnificence, is the mixed-blood agitator,\r\nthe general, the governor, the cabinet official who have battened on\r\nMexico’s misery before this day and will doubtless do so long after\r\nthis day is passed.\r\n\r\nThe raising of the Indian masses of Mexico by promises and by\r\nhigh-sounding battlecries is a game as old as Mexican history; it is\r\nplayed with unvarying success year after year and generation after\r\ngeneration. The more extravagant the promises, the more complete the\r\nenthusiasm of the “proletariat,” both for the political movement of the\r\nmoment, and for the one which follows it immediately upon the discovery\r\nby the unfortunate “people” that the previous promises are not going to\r\nbe kept.\r\n\r\nBut in to-day’s orgy of revolution, Mexico has gone further toward\r\ndestruction than she has ever gone before. Values throughout native\r\nMexico are almost non-existent, and the wheels of Mexican civilization\r\nlike the wheels of the wheezy locomotives of her railways, creak and\r\ngroan on their rounds. The nation’s economic life is tied together\r\nby strings, and what remains is only what has been salvaged from her\r\njunk-heaps, and like the lawn-mower borrowed from a neighbor, is kept\r\nrunning only to serve the purposes of the borrower.\r\n\r\nThe seventy years of warfare before Diaz left intact the civilization\r\nof the Spaniards for Diaz to revive, but the ten years from Diaz to\r\nObregon have torn that civilization to shreds. Nearly all that Diaz\r\nbuilt has disappeared, and to-day the business of Mexico is swapping\r\njack-knives and selling food and shelter at the highest prices the\r\ntraffic will bear.\r\n\r\nNo man who would face truth in Mexico can ignore these potent facts.\r\nAnd the reason is not revolution, nor even mere radicalism, but the\r\ncynical application of political control to economic needs for the\r\naggrandizement of individual leaders whose power is in the market for\r\nall who will buy the privileges which they have to offer.\r\n\r\nIt is in this condition that the importance and the menace of\r\nradical Mexican government are found. What it has seemed well to\r\ncall bolshevism in Mexico has its greatest power in its mere threat\r\nagainst capital and business. That threat, the mere presence of the\r\nanti-capitalistic constitution and laws, has probably far greater power\r\nthan their actual application would have. Once the blow of confiscation\r\nfell, the answer from the world of business and civilized government\r\nwould be quick and sure--Mexico cannot be ignored as Russia can be, for\r\nMexico lies in the center of the trade-routes of the globe, and we in\r\nthe United States would feel the menace of her anarchy too strongly to\r\nremain passive.\r\n\r\nBut the static power, the threat of laws which are never\r\nenforced--there is the menace and there the great influence which\r\ncreates the graft and cynicism of Mexican officials. So long as\r\nthose laws remain, business, if it would survive in Mexico, must\r\nbuy immunity. And it does buy it, for business is ever timid, and\r\nno single business organization and seldom a group of business\r\norganizations, will ever go to the stake for a principle. Its duty\r\nto its stockholders and to its employees makes it buy its way, not\r\nalways by direct graft, but in submission to vast taxes, to unwarranted\r\nextortions, to the riding of official annoyances--rather than accept\r\nthe shut-down and fight with its own great power, its inertia of\r\nmovement or of the silence which ruins empires.\r\n\r\nIn recent months the great business groups in Mexico have opposed a\r\ncertain amount of strength to the growing power of the auction-block\r\nof Mexican graft and privilege. The oil companies have from time to\r\ntime offered a solid front to the encroachments of this marketing of\r\nthe privilege of doing business in contraversion of the temporary\r\nlaws of Mexico. They have held back, apparently, the crushing fall of\r\nactual enforcement of the confiscatory provisions of the Constitution\r\nof 1917, and they have, here and there, stopped the marketing of\r\nprivilege--for brief periods. But looking at the whole picture, it\r\nseems as if the Mexican officials of the present era are in no greater\r\nhurry to enforce the confiscation than are the foreigners to have it\r\nenforced. The static power of those provisions, waiting to fall, is\r\nfar more profitable to Mexican pockets than would be the sudden and\r\nfinal crash of their genuine application. Their enforcement would be\r\nof little value to the seller of privilege, for then he would have to\r\ninvent another method of extortion. No, privilege will long remain\r\nupon the market counters of Mexico. It will remain there, in fact,\r\nuntil some means is found, within or without Mexico, for destroying the\r\nsystem which is so profitable. That need of change is the crisis of the\r\nbusiness world of Mexico, the crisis of all who would do business with\r\nMexico in the present or in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, can save Mexico in this crisis? The panacea of the Obregon\r\nidea was certainly not a solution. Here indeed was a probably genuine\r\ndesire to solve the problem in a final and glorious way. But the tools\r\nwere but the tools of the old days of Carranza and the rest. That was\r\na political remedy for an economic condition, and its promise was a\r\nsordid thing, an unworthy thing for Mexico or for the United States to\r\nexpect. For the promise of Obregon was at first for reaction, a belief\r\nthat Obregon was comfortably wealthy already or that his ambition was\r\nfor power alone. Therefore he was to be the great conservative, who\r\nwould save Mexico by slipping back to the days of Diaz. But reaction\r\nmust always fail in the end. In this case it passed quickly, for this\r\nwas a “reaction” which was part and parcel of the “radicalism” of\r\nCarranza, its power but a manifestation in another form of the same\r\npersonalism, the same sale of privilege, which made Carranza impossible\r\nand in the end, brought him to his ruin.\r\n\r\nThe later developments of the Obregon idea were marked by an obvious\r\nanxiety to reach a permanent solution of the immediate and pressing\r\ndifficulties of Mexico, and most of all to secure recognition by the\r\nUnited States and financial aid from American bankers, as the _sine\r\nqua non_ of such a solution. The efforts put forth were powerful, but\r\nthe driving force back of them was primarily personal ambition and the\r\nrealization that only such a solution could save the happy hunting\r\ngrounds of revolutionary leaders from some sort of foreign intendancy.\r\nAnd above and beyond and behind all, were the factors of government\r\nwhose origins and whose immediate past seem indeed to be as firmly\r\nstamped upon their natures as the spots upon the leopard or his skin\r\nupon the Ethiopian.\r\n\r\nThe completed cycle of the bolshevist experiment and the arrival back\r\nat the sale of privilege links up with the failure of Obregon to offer\r\nanything but, first, a promise of reversion to reactionary czarism and,\r\nsecond, that unconcealed offering of privileges and promises of power\r\nto all who could or who might aid in the campaign for recognition and\r\nfor foreign loans. The condition seems to me to sound a call as of\r\nElijah for a new understanding of the Mexican problem. Carrancism might\r\nhave been but an isolated interlude, might have been a mere question\r\nof observation and interpretation, if the end had not come and if\r\nbusiness in Mexico were not continuing to pay for its sorry privileges\r\nin the same sorry way. Obregon might perhaps have been the hope for\r\npeace and happiness in Mexico if we had not had Carranza and de la\r\nHuerta and if their followers, with their cynical mouthings of all the\r\nmost sacred faiths of man, were not to-day still the rulers of Mexico,\r\nstill the sellers of privilege in the name of human progress.\r\n\r\nWe must, I believe, cast away the too long nurtured idea that the\r\nbattle in Mexico is between the progressive thought of the day and\r\nthe reactionary conservatism of great interests. I have sought here\r\nto show why this is so. A revolution which can evolve the idea of the\r\nsocialization of great industry and can, in the very conception of that\r\nidea, turn it to the looting of that industry for private graft and\r\ngain, as in Yucatan; a revolution which can produce the uncontrolled\r\nradicalism of Carranza and evolve through the cynical play-acting\r\nof de la Huerta into the promise of reactionism in Obregon with all\r\nthe unholy forces which supported Carranza rallying to uphold his\r\nsuccessors--such a revolution will not, unredeemed, carry Mexico into\r\nher next era of progress and peace. Capital and socialism must alike\r\nbeware. Neither should, in honesty with itself, accept a cause in\r\nMexico until the issue is joined clear.\r\n\r\nIn the past ten years we have seen in turn the appeal of political\r\nMexico, to-day to the bolshevist, to-morrow to the Christian\r\nmissionary, to-day to the thinking radical of the universities,\r\nto-morrow to the deep-dyed conservative of the counting room. Confusion\r\nhas piled upon confusion until we have each seen in Mexico what we\r\nhoped or what we feared.\r\n\r\nWe can only begin to see the truth, and in the truth the solution of\r\nthe complicated Mexican problem, when we clear our minds of these\r\nold ideas that he who is against the revolutionary government in\r\nMexico is a hopeless reactionary, and that he who is for it is a\r\nraving bolshevist. For the Mexican revolution is part of the “world\r\nrevolution” only as the shibboleths of that vast upheaval have been\r\nturned to the aggrandizement of Mexican leaders who know neither what\r\nthe phrases mean nor where they lead.\r\n\r\nIf this is grasped, and if we will look at Mexico as a problem for us\r\nall, then the beginning of the road away from foreign intervention and\r\nthe peril to our peace and Mexico’s will begin to open. Intervention\r\ncan be avoided, even though it may be grievously close to-day. But it\r\ncannot be avoided until we see clearly that the issue of intervention,\r\nlike the whole issue of the Mexican revolution, is not one of\r\ncapitalistic interests against the unhappy Mexican peon, but a struggle\r\nof all the constructive thinkers and workers of the world--be they\r\nradical, socialistic, religious, philosophical, laborite, capitalistic,\r\nindustrial or social, be they American, English, French, Russian or\r\nMexican--against forces of greed and ignorance which turn every ideal\r\nof honest men to the prostitution of their country and the exploitation\r\nof their fellows within and without its borders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                          THE RAPE OF YUCATAN\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the golden wheat fields of Kansas to the barren sands of\r\nYucatan, from the loaf of bread on your table to the loot of Mexican\r\nrevolutions--these seem mighty leaps of imagination or of fiction. Yet\r\nthe link is closer than imagination could ever forge, the analogy a\r\nstranger tale than the yarns of Captain Kidd.\r\n\r\nThe modern industry of wheat farming depends, by one of the romantic\r\nbalances of world commerce, upon the supply of binder twine for the\r\nmechanical harvester, a supply which comes alone, to-day, from the\r\ncultivation of a humble cactus plant in far-off Yucatan. The great\r\nMexican industry of raising this henequen or sisal hemp was prostituted\r\nby Mexican revolutionists to the manipulation of the binder twine\r\nmarket so that in four years more than a hundred million dollars in\r\nartificially inflated prices were dragged from American farmers. Thus\r\nit was that through the helpless years of the Great War, all who ate\r\nthe bread of the wheat, from you and me in America to the starving\r\nchildren of Belgium, paid bitter tribute to the greed of Mexican\r\nagitators.\r\n\r\nThe story of Yucatan is no mere tale of the by-play of revolution,\r\nthe “fortunes of war” or the “necessary accompaniments of a great\r\nsocial upheaval.” It is the history of the deliberate looting of a\r\ncommonwealth and of an indispensable international industry. In the\r\nname of socialism, shouting the battle-cries of the age-long struggle\r\nfor human freedom, Mexican revolutionary leaders turned the richest\r\nagricultural state of Mexico into a desert waste, prostituted the only\r\ncreative industry in the whole country to the looting of the world’s\r\nfarmlands and the taxing of every loaf of bread consumed in the world.\r\nThe vast tribute which thus poured into the coffers of revolutionary\r\ngovernment was utterly lost to public vision almost before it had\r\nleft the market-places, and not one cent of it was ever turned to the\r\neasing of the sorry human burden of the Mexican peon or devoted to the\r\neducation and upbuilding of the Mexican people.\r\n\r\nThe story of Yucatan is the story of as gruesome a rape of Mother\r\nEarth as man has known. Beginning with the familiar picture of the\r\ndowntrodden peon of the Diaz time, it runs the gamut through the\r\nmarching armies of conquerors, through a cycle of high-sounding\r\nsocialism to bloody oppressions, and on to a newer despotism and\r\nfinally to utter economic collapse. In the end it flattens down into\r\nthe present, an era of capitalistic struggle in which the state, by\r\nthe laws of economics which its despots perverted so vigorously, is\r\nbeing ground between the millstones of opposing forces of the very\r\nbusiness which was once the source of all its wealth and all its\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nUpon the wheat crop of the world depends the life of the world, and\r\nupon the mechanical harvester depends, literally, the life of the\r\nmodern wheat industry. In its turn, the operation of the harvester\r\nis dependent upon the millions of miles of binder twine which alone\r\nmake possible the handling of the wheat on its way from the standing\r\nfields to the thresher which converts it to golden grain. Since Cyrus\r\nMcCormick first offered his “reaper” to the American farmer, more than\r\nfifty years ago, invention has sought far and wide for freedom from the\r\nneed of twine for the binding of the sheaves, but neither “header” nor\r\nmechanical flail has been able to achieve it; to-day the wheat farmer\r\nmust have twine, and that by the hundreds and millions of pounds, to\r\nharvest his crop.\r\n\r\nThus, because the sisal hemp or henequen of Yucatan is the only fiber\r\nwhich can be produced in sufficient quantities at a low price to\r\nmeet the farmer’s need for binder twine, the wheat for the world’s\r\nfood supply depends vitally on the product of this one distant state\r\nof Mexico. Without its humble aid, the American farmer might,\r\nconceivably, hark back to the binding of wheat sheaves by hand--it\r\nis certain that we could anticipate the scrapping of billions of\r\ndollars’ worth of mechanical harvesters in the substitution of some\r\nother method than theirs. The only other fiber that will serve for the\r\nmaking of binder twine is true Manila hemp, whose total crop would not\r\nfill a tenth of the needs of the world’s annual harvest, and whose\r\nfiner quality and greater cost have caused it to be devoted almost\r\nexclusively to the making of high-class cordage. Cotton and jute and\r\nsilk and all other known or promised vegetable or animal fibers from\r\nwhich binder twine might conceivably be made have proven useless for\r\nthe purpose. One of them is too stout, one too soft, one too short of\r\nfiber, one not brittle enough, another too brittle. Sisal, the Yucatan\r\nhenequen, is to-day the only hemp which meets all demands of the\r\nworld’s annual wheat harvest, a demand which has reached the colossal\r\ntotal of 400,000,000 pounds a year.\r\n\r\nUpon this need has been built the one great creative industry of\r\nMexico, the one business, agricultural or manufacturing, which in\r\nMexico produces wealth through human energy. Its source is the\r\nlong-leaved henequen plant, to whose necessarily slow growth for\r\nfiber the sandy, desert soil of the Yucatan coastland is peculiarly\r\nadapted. The henequen is a species of the great agave, that strange,\r\ncactus-like “Century plant,” which is found in one form or another\r\nin almost all desert countries. As the maguey, it grows in the great\r\nCentral Mexican plateau, furnishing the heavy drink called _pulque_,\r\nand giving up a hand-extracted fiber which has been woven into the\r\nraiment of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico for centuries. Still\r\nother varieties, in the warmer sections of Mexico, furnish food for\r\ncattle and, distilled, the fiery _mescal_ or _tequila_ which is an even\r\nmore terrible curse of Mexico than the much-berated _pulque_.\r\n\r\nIt is the henequen, however, which is the most commercially useful of\r\nall the agaves, for its narrow leaves, three to four feet long, are\r\npeculiarly adapted to the mechanical extraction of their fiber (which\r\nmost of the agaves are not). The coarse, rasping, yellow strands have\r\nthe thickness and the strength of horsehair, so that they survive the\r\nvigorous de-pulping process of the great gin-like machines. After\r\ndrying, they furnish a stout fiber which, when woven into thick cord,\r\nties the wheat sheaves in the harvester, and breaks easily as each\r\nsheaf is thrown back into the thresher in the gorgeous pageant of the\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nThis henequen, the sisal hemp of commerce, was first exported in 1864,\r\nand by 1880 was one of the well-known but minor fibers in the American\r\nmarket. In 1898, when the Spanish-American war cut off the exports of\r\nManila hemp, henequen sprang into immediate and great importance, its\r\nprice rose from 2¹⁄₂ cents to 10 cents a pound in New York, and an\r\nimmediate increase in the industry and in the economic importance of\r\nthe state of Yucatan took place. There was a lively boom in henequen\r\nlands, and incidentally an improvement in social and political\r\nconditions in Yucatan, followed by something of a slump with a few mild\r\npanics around 1907.\r\n\r\nBut henequen fiber had been definitely established in the market and\r\nselling as it did at an average price of 5¹⁄₄ cents a pound, became\r\nthe great staple for the manufacture of binder twine. This new and\r\nvirtually inexhaustible supply of cheap fiber for twine-making played\r\nits part in the broadening use of the mechanical harvester, until by\r\n1915 Yucatan henequen binder twine was being shipped to every wheat\r\nproducing area in the world, from the Siberian steppes to the pampas of\r\nthe Argentine.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 the exports from Mexico were more than a million bales or\r\napproximately 400,000,000 pounds, which was a doubling of production in\r\nfourteen years. The current price of about 6 cents a pound had enabled\r\nthe Yucatan growers to build up immense fortunes and made it possible\r\nfor the manufacturers of the thousands of tons of binder twine to\r\nfurnish it to the American farmer at less than 10 cents a pound.\r\n\r\nThe chief manufacturers of binder twine and, therefore, the chief\r\nbuyers of Yucatan henequen, are the International Harvester Company,\r\nwhich makes about half the binder twine used in the world, the\r\nPlymouth Cordage Company, which makes about a quarter of the entire\r\nsupply, and various state penitentiaries in the wheat belt of the\r\nUnited States. All of these manufacturers work on close margins for\r\nthe Harvester Company’s business is selling harvester machines and it\r\nseems interested materially in keeping the price of such accessories\r\nas twine as low as possible. The effect of this, combined with Yankee\r\nshrewdness, has been a continuous effort to keep the price of Yucatan\r\nhenequen down to rock bottom, and to this end its buyers have been\r\ncheerful arbiters of the price of the sisal in the Mexican market.\r\n\r\nThey were never, however, quite the grasping, grinding capitalistic\r\ndespots they were described as being by the Yucatecans, for those of\r\nus who can remember back into the philosophic days before 1914 will\r\nrecollect that it was not customary for even American capital to kill\r\nthe geese that laid the golden eggs. The Yucatan hacendados were\r\nencouraged to demand, and get, comfortable prices for their product,\r\nand incidentally to plant large new acreages of the henequen plants.\r\n\r\nIt was this large planting, which went on from 1900 to 1914, which\r\ncaused the first glimmering of the idea of “direct action” on the part\r\nof the hacendados, the growers of the sisal. It takes seven years for\r\nhenequen plants to come into bearing, and the prospect of immensely\r\nincreased production and probably lowered prices inspired the first\r\nidea of a pool which would maintain the old price levels. In 1912 a\r\nscheme for regulating the price of henequen was first presented to his\r\nfellows by a Yucatan hacendado. His idea was not so much to create\r\nan artificial shortage by storing the hemp, as to form some sort of\r\norganization which would have first chance to buy the henequen crop\r\nand thus make the hacendados participants in the profits made by the\r\njobbers or middlemen.\r\n\r\nThe organization which resulted, in 1914, was called the “_Comisión\r\nReguladora del Mercado de Henequén_” (Commission for Regulating\r\nthe Henequen Market), or, for short, the “Reguladora.” It was not,\r\nhowever, a great success, for the Reguladora was only an organization\r\nbuying in competition with the old established agents, and the\r\ngrowers still pursued their own immediate interests in seeking their\r\nmarkets. Coöperation has never been one of the outstanding virtues\r\nof the Mexicans, and in the selling of their crops the Yucatecan\r\nhacendados have never shown any sign of a break away from the national\r\nindividualism. The hacendados have always done their business in\r\nMerida, the capital and business center of Yucatan. They pass from one\r\nsunlit office to another, wailing dismally over the terrible prices\r\nthe comfortably ensconced buyers offered them and their unfortunate\r\nfellows, but seeking and ready at a momentary hint to drive a bargain\r\nwhich would cut their neighbors’ throats on the possible chance of a\r\ntemporary personal profit. The gentlemanly agreement of the Reguladora\r\nwas not, under these circumstances, a controlling factor in the\r\nhenequen market.\r\n\r\nThis was the situation when, in March, 1915, General Salvador Alvarado,\r\na doughty retainer of President Carranza, “captured” the state of\r\nYucatan with an army of 8,000 men which he had brought from Vera\r\nCruz. Although Mexico has been in revolution since 1911, Yucatan had,\r\ntill this time, taken little part, accepting new governors with mild\r\nsurprise but no opposition as one administration succeeded another\r\nin Mexico City. Yucatan is a great peninsula far to the east of the\r\nMexican mainland, unconnected by railways, and thirty-six hours’\r\njourney by fast steamer across the Gulf of Mexico from Vera Cruz. The\r\nYucatecans have always considered themselves as a people somewhat\r\napart from other Mexicans, and during many of the revolutions previous\r\nto Diaz, the peninsula remained aloof and politically independent,\r\nre-entering the Mexican confederation only toward the close of the\r\npre-Diaz era.\r\n\r\nGeneral Alvarado is a product of northern Mexico. He belongs with\r\nthe true Carrancista group in Mexican politics, has been a candidate\r\nfor president of Mexico and has made many trips to the United States\r\nas a financier, most recently as an envoy of the de la Huerta\r\ngovernment in search of a rehabilitating loan. All this, however, has\r\ncome since his spectacular experience in Yucatan. In that state he\r\ngained the experience, and political record, which made him aspire\r\nto the presidency of Mexico, and earned his diploma as revolutionary\r\nfinancier. There, also, he probably first acquired those radical ideas\r\nwhich enabled him to assert, as he did in the Mexican Chamber of\r\nDeputies in November of 1920:\r\n\r\n“I am a bolshevist, I have always been a bolshevist, and I shall always\r\nbe a bolshevist.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Alvarado’s first government work was as a custom-house\r\nemployee, but he joined the Carranza movement early and early rose to\r\nthe rank of general through the manifestation of a thoroughly forceful\r\npersonality and a ruthless preoccupation with his own advancement.\r\n\r\nYucatan, in its isolation, in its great wealth, and its easy-going\r\nmanners, presented General Alvarado with the opportunity of his career.\r\nHere were ungathered riches for revolutionary spoils, here was noble\r\nopportunity for the uplift of the “submerged 85 per cent,” here was\r\nwaiting easy military glory of conquest with no one to oppose. In going\r\nto Yucatan, General Alvarado was, moreover, encumbered by none of the\r\npolitical and business experience which delays the prompt execution\r\nof inspired ideas. Nor was he inhibited by any preconception of the\r\nneeds of the commonwealth or its chief industry, for this was his first\r\nvisit to his future principality. All he knew or heard was that Yucatan\r\nwas rich and that its proletariat was “oppressed,” largely by wicked\r\nforeigners of shocking and predatory manners.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived in Yucatan, General Alvarado noted with interest\r\nthe beauty of that gem of Mexican state capitals, Merida, with its\r\nsun-clear streets and its beautiful parks and public buildings. He\r\nsaw the luxurious equipages and homes and visited the great haciendas\r\nof henequen. In the meantime, he looked over the documents in the\r\ngovernor’s office and the stock of gold in the state treasury.\r\nHe scowled his disapproval, as was the Carrancista habit, at the\r\nforeigners engaged in the henequen business. Then his attention was\r\ncalled to the charter of the Reguladora, the harmless agreement of the\r\nhacendados to keep the price of the fiber as high as they could and\r\nstill not soil their hands with trade.\r\n\r\nThis charter had courteously made the governor of the state ex-officio\r\nhead of the Reguladora. Promptly, and without more authority, General\r\nAlvarado took charge of the organization. His first act was to force\r\nupon the unhappy hacendados, through the authority of their own\r\ninstrument, a corporation which took their own business utterly out of\r\ntheir own hands and forced them to the acceptance of official dictation\r\nwithout dissent or question.\r\n\r\nTo the end of organizing his Reguladora in line with modern thought and\r\nto thorough efficiency for his own ends, he invited in from Mexico City\r\nthe one set of brains in the Carranza administration, those of Luis\r\nCabrera, and called in the motley company of self-styled “socialists”\r\nwho had been drawn to Yucatan by the lurid tales of revolutionary\r\npropagandists who had predicted the inevitable uprising of the\r\noppressed proletariat when opportunity should be given them.\r\n\r\nThis cabinet laid out the Reguladora plan, and two American bankers of\r\nNew Orleans, Saul Wechsler and Lynn H. Dinkins, organized a syndicate\r\nwhich agreed to finance the cornering of the henequen market up to\r\n$10,000,000. There was no socialism in this phase of the plan, for the\r\nbankers were to receive a commission of $4 per bale on all henequen\r\nmarketed, plus the current banking rate of interest for all moneys\r\nneeded, the loans to be fully secured by mortgages against hemp in\r\nstorage or in transit.\r\n\r\nSo far all was well, but here Alvarado met his first difficulty. The\r\nhenequen growers were not socialistically inclined, nor were they\r\nas trusting of his good faith, or so well secured as the American\r\nbankers, nor had they so much to gain or so little to lose as the\r\n“socialist” advisers of the governor. Many of them refused to be bound\r\nby the new rules of the Reguladora, which included, amongst others, a\r\nprovision that no hemp should be sold to any agent or interest save the\r\nReguladora.\r\n\r\nBut Alvarado’s government called on the hacendados to subscribe to\r\nhis rules for the Reguladora, and to those who refused it threatened\r\n(and gave evidence of the fullness of its intentions to carry out its\r\nthreats) to fire the fields and throw the offending hacendados and\r\ntheir families into the flames. It organized the Red Guard of Yucatan\r\n(called the “Leagues of Resistance”), and spread terrorism throughout\r\nthe peninsula. It drove out the tiny group of foreigners who for\r\ntwenty-five years had been engaged in “exploiting” the unfortunate\r\nYucatan proletariat by keeping the capitalistic hacendados from getting\r\ntoo much money out of American farmers. Along with them went hundreds\r\nof the hacendados and their families, and also priests and nuns, while\r\nthe simple Indians who could not take steamers for foreign ports\r\nemigrated quietly back into the forests of interior Yucatan.\r\n\r\nFor Alvarado’s henchmen closed the churches, burned their priceless\r\nhistorical records, and outraged nuns and priests. They turned the\r\nchurch buildings into “labor temples” and barracks and storehouses\r\nfrom which later was sold, over the counter, the liquor which had\r\nbeen confiscated in enforcement of “prohibition” in Yucatan. They\r\nturned the schools of towns and plantations into centers of propaganda\r\nand espionage under imported “teachers” who knew none of the Indian\r\nlanguage, and many of whom could not write their own names. They\r\nconfiscated great haciendas under the elaborately “socialistic”\r\nagrarian law, and for those upon whom the iron hand did not fall\r\ndirectly, established a reign of terror in the raids of the “Leagues of\r\nResistance,” whose crimes, from night-riding and burglary to rape and\r\nmurder, the Legislature declared to be “political offenses” in the name\r\nof “socialism,” and thus outside the jurisdiction of the common courts.\r\n\r\nHis henchmen, foreigners, Mexicans and Yucatecans, raised up the\r\npreviously contented “industrial workers,” railway men, porters\r\nand longshoremen (numbering in all less than 9,000 out of a state\r\npopulation of 300,000), forming them into unions whose increasing wages\r\nwere overlapped more rapidly than they were raised by the rising costs\r\nof the handling of the imported commodities upon which they, like\r\nevery one else, must live in desert Yucatan. Their wages, and the cost\r\nof living, multiplied eight times in the four years, while the wages\r\nof the farm workers little more than doubled, and a grievously added\r\nburden was placed upon the hacendados who from time immemorial have\r\ntaken up the loss in increased food prices so that their farm workers\r\nmay live.\r\n\r\nBy such means, and with such control, General Alvarado acquired the\r\ndomination of the industrial life of Yucatan and of henequen production\r\nupon which he built up his market corner. In the selling of the product\r\nso controlled, he raised the price of raw henequen from 7 cents a\r\npound in New York to more than 19 cents a pound in the same market.\r\nSo firm was his grip on production and on distribution that he could,\r\nand did, withhold stock which was sorely needed in the harvest fields,\r\nbringing about, in 1916 (through this means and through the soaring\r\nprices which had to be asked for the binder twine which was sold),\r\nan investigation by a committee of the United States Senate. This\r\ncommittee, after months of investigation, completely exonerated the\r\nAmerican manufacturers from the charge of profiteering, and perhaps\r\nfor the first time in the history of that august body, placed itself on\r\nrecord as asserting that a foreign government had acted the rôle of an\r\niniquitous trust in creating an artificial shortage and artificially\r\ninflated prices for a product vital to the business of America’s farms.\r\n\r\nIn the four years that the Reguladora corner lasted, more than\r\n$200,000,000 in advanced prices were taken from American buyers, an\r\naverage advance of more than 200 per cent. Thus, granting a legitimate\r\ndoubling of the price of the fiber in keeping with the doubling of the\r\ncosts of other commodities in this period (1915-1919), the accepted\r\nfigure of $112,000,000 of direct loot through the Alvarado henequen\r\ncorner may be taken as literally true. And this was loot that never\r\nreached either the cruel hacendados who owned the farms or the workers\r\nwho furnished the labor for the creation of the product. All this and\r\nmore went into the bottomless pit of Mexican revolutionary graft.\r\n\r\nThis henequen corner was, it must be remembered, created in the name\r\nof socialism and the salvation of the downtrodden peon. Along with it\r\nwent a mass of other activities, wherein the funds derived from the\r\nsale of henequen at the advancing prices were turned to schemes of\r\nostensible government ownership, socialization and coöperation. Before\r\neven the hacendados were given the 4 cents a pound guaranteed them\r\nas first payment against the great profits to come from the “corner,”\r\nthe Reguladora funds were invested in the purchase of the state\r\nrailways, at prices to this day unknown. These funds also financed the\r\norganization of the _Compañia de Fomento del Sur-Est_ (Development\r\nCompany of the South-East) and bought nine old Mexican coasting\r\nsteamers at a cost of $4,000,000 so that the socialists of Yucatan\r\nmight not be dependent on capitalistic steamship lines. The Reguladora\r\nalso financed the drilling of oil wells, and built a flock of tanks\r\nto contain the oil--which never came out of the ground. It also built\r\na railway, confiscating therefor, “for the common good,” one-tenth of\r\nall the rails and equipment of the private plantation railways on the\r\nhenequen farms; in a few months it sold this railway to a favorite for\r\n$150,000, a tenth of its cash cost, payable in ten years.\r\n\r\nThe _Cia. de Fomento del Sur-Est_ entered upon the business of\r\nrelieving the oppressed proletariat from the wicked prices for the\r\nnecessities of life fixed by capitalistic grocerymen. It bought its own\r\nsupplies in the United States, transported them in its own steamers,\r\nand sold them--for more than the current retail rates! The proletariat\r\ndid not benefit from any of these schemes, but the government henchmen\r\nwho bought in the United States, and those who sold in Yucatan, waxed\r\nfat and comfortable, although remaining firm and loyal socialists to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nAll these things were done in the name of socialism, and in that name,\r\nalso, the power of Reguladora gold was felt even in the heart of the\r\nUnited States, in a heart made sensitive to such machinations by the\r\nnervous strain of the war which was already at our throats. Not a\r\nlittle of the money derived from the sale of henequen at prices four\r\nand five times normal was used in the conducting of a campaign of\r\npropaganda. Mexican and foreign “socialists” were kept in the United\r\nStates lecturing and writing and publishing magazines and books. These\r\nactivities were radical and, in part at least, I. W. W., in general\r\ncharacter but they were devoted also to spreading the fame of the\r\nAlvarado brand of socialization of industry in Yucatan and to the\r\ndissemination of anti-American ideas under the guise of socialism.\r\n\r\nIt was glory and it was madness to strike thus at the heart of the\r\n“Colossus of the North” as the anti-foreign Mexican orators like to\r\ncall the United States, and at the very same time at the “Colossus of\r\nMammon,” as the wilder socialists referred to us in Yucatan. Carranza\r\nhad tried the former form of baiting, but the combination of the two\r\nwas an orgy of glory reserved for the satellites of Alvarado. Never\r\nwas anything quite so daring and quite so magnificent ever done by a\r\nMexican revolutionist before, and not even Carranza dared do more.\r\n\r\nSo glory and madness traveled together, but meanwhile, out in the\r\nhenequen fields and in the Indian villages, Yucatan toiled on. The\r\nsimple natives could not quite appreciate the “socialists” and\r\nliterally fled in terror before some of their manifestations, so that\r\nin that day, and in this as well, they tell you with eager friendship\r\nto “beware of these terrible socialists.” To them, “socialist” is a\r\nname associated with things that are, to their simple minds, quite\r\nunsocial.\r\n\r\nAlvarado, in his “conquest” of Yucatan, had frankly spread terror\r\nthroughout the peninsula. Opposed, on his triumphal march to Merida, by\r\na small “home guard” of upper and middle class youths, he had captured\r\nand shot scores of them in cold blood, as “traitors,” and pursued his\r\nway. He had, as I have noted, closed and sacked the churches, remarking\r\nthat “As the revolution advances, God recedes.” Then, on one of the\r\nmain boulevards of Merida, he had allowed the dead bodies of two who\r\nhad offended him to swing from sunrise to sunset from a limb of an oak\r\ntree, so that thereafter the simple words, “Remember the oak tree,”\r\nwere sufficient to bring the stoutest-hearted conservative to terms.\r\n\r\nBut for all that, General Alvarado protested unfailing friendship for\r\nthe peons and the Indians, grieved somewhat by their distrust of him,\r\nbut pronouncing his devotion to their welfare in no measured terms. In\r\nhis carrying out of his “socialistic” policies, he did not, however,\r\nconsult their wishes or even their possibilities of development. His\r\none panacea for the ills of the Indians was “land,” and land he and\r\nhis imported advisers were determined to give them, no matter whether\r\nthey wanted it or not. Never did the ideals of socialism, beautiful in\r\nthemselves, have an uglier distortion.\r\n\r\n“Land distribution” is, as I have said, the crux of the protestations\r\nof all Mexican revolutionists. Upon the alleged land hunger of the\r\nIndians the revolutionists have based most of their appeals for\r\nforeign sympathy. The actual facts of the labor situation, in Mexico\r\nand especially in Yucatan, are therefore worth brief description in\r\nthis connection. The so-called “peonage system” of Mexico goes back\r\nhistorically to pre-Spanish times. It is based on the psychological\r\ndifficulty of obtaining continuous labor. Continuous labor being vital\r\nto such an industry as henequen growing, there flourished in Yucatan,\r\nprevious to 1914, a system of indebtedness which was practically\r\nslavery. Laborers on the plantations were allowed to get into debt in\r\norder that they might be held on the plantations on the pretext of\r\nworking out the advances which were made from time to time by the\r\nhacendados. These debts averaged about 200 pesos ($100) a man, and it\r\nis undoubtedly true that the system was the origin of wicked abuses,\r\na plantation store credit system being devised to keep the peons\r\nalways in debt, and workers being sold by the head for their debts.\r\nConfinement in barbed wire enclosures was common in some sections, and\r\naltogether the picture of the Yucatan situation especially was a very\r\nunlovely one.\r\n\r\nBut the system of debt advances was really effectively abolished under\r\nMadero, two full years before Carranza and Alvarado entered upon the\r\nscene, and it is worth noting that the hacendados, many of whom had\r\nfortunes tied up in peon debts, found themselves far happier to be free\r\nfrom the system than were the peons. It is indeed questionable whether\r\nthe peonage system, as such (and where it was not abused), was entirely\r\ndistasteful to the Indians who were its victims. Lacking any ability to\r\nsave, the abolition of the system of debt advances wrenched from their\r\ngrasp the only possible form of enjoying the fruits of their labor\r\noutside their usual hand-to-mouth existence. Under the old systems they\r\nwere able to have some of the good things of life by getting an advance\r\nin money, which they spent gayly, careless of the future, and then\r\nproceeded to work out the debt in the months or years which followed.\r\nBasically, the system had its redeeming features, when considered from\r\nthe viewpoint of Indian psychology, even though the abuses were such\r\nthat its abolition was inevitable.\r\n\r\nLinked up with the peonage system was the land distribution question,\r\nfar too complicated for its origins to be gone into here.[6] In\r\nYucatan, the most heavily populated section is not the most fertile.\r\nHenequen is not grown in the forests back from the sandy seacoast where\r\nprehistoric civilization left the great ruins of a rich and glorious\r\nempire, but on the seacoast itself. This virtual desert, extending in\r\nsome places twenty-five miles back from the coast, is the land which is\r\nadapted to the growing of henequen, for a slow maturing of the plant is\r\nvital to the creation of those long, strong fibers which constitute the\r\nvaluable portion of the leaves.\r\n\r\nThis so-called desert land is sometimes capable, when first cleared of\r\nbrush, of one or even two croppings of corn. Then it must lie fallow\r\nfor many years before another food crop can be raised. The native\r\nIndian, therefore, has little or no use for a small plot, or indeed\r\nfor the ownership of any plot of ground, unless he can crop it once or\r\ntwice and then sell it to a henequen planter, while the Indian seeks\r\nother corn-lands elsewhere. If the government hampers him in moving\r\nabout, he prefers not to try to live as an independent farmer, but to\r\nwork on a plantation where he can get regular pay for cutting henequen\r\nleaves, and also can cultivate a little corn-plot lent him by the\r\nhacendado and renewed each year.\r\n\r\nNow the Indian, despite the fortunes which have been made by the\r\nhacendados in the henequen business, has no interest at all in\r\nbecoming a henequen grower. He knows from experience that the value\r\nof the leaves he himself produces are little more than what he would\r\nbe paid on an hacienda for cutting the hacendado’s own leaves, and\r\nhe knows that he has not the capital or the initiative to go into\r\nhemp production himself. The result was that some years ago, when the\r\ncommunal land was first distributed to the Indians, it was cropped once\r\nor twice and then sold to the nearest hacendado to become henequen\r\nplots.\r\n\r\nSometimes indeed, the communal land was so worthless for corn that the\r\nhacendados were allowed to take it over without payment or protest and\r\nto plant it to henequen. This loss, from the Indian viewpoint, was\r\nfar from an unmixed evil, for the natives of the commune profited in\r\nthe gaining of an opportunity for assured livelihood close by their\r\nhomes--difficult enough except on the henequen farms, in the desert\r\nsections of Yucatan.\r\n\r\nHenequen production is far more of an industry than it is a farming\r\nproject. Primarily, it requires from the planting of the shoots until\r\nthe first leaves are ready for cutting, eight years of continual and\r\nexpensive care, for the fields must be kept clear of brush and weeds,\r\nthe plants tended and those which die replaced with regularity. After\r\neight years of continuous outlay, the leaves are cut, brought into a\r\ngreat industrial plant where machinery and many workers are required to\r\nremove the pulp, to dry the hemp fiber on racks under the sun, to pack\r\nit into 400-pound bales in hydraulic presses, and to ship it to the\r\ndistant American market. The agricultural end of the henequen business\r\nis but a small item in its process, and no individual farmer, even if\r\nhe has moderate capital, can prosper on it.\r\n\r\nThe land distribution planned by Alvarado was to be made from the\r\ngreat henequen haciendas, and some of the oratory defending the\r\nconfiscation of those haciendas pointed out the fact that this very\r\nland had been stolen from the Indian communes in years gone by and was\r\nnow being returned to the original Indian owners. That was interesting\r\nto the pitying audiences of the Alvarado propagandists in the United\r\nStates, but it was of not the slightest interest to the Indians of\r\nYucatan. They had once owned that land, and had or had not cropped it\r\nin corn once or twice. They knew quite well it was hardly worth the\r\ntrouble and the expense in taxes it would be for them to own it again,\r\nespecially as they saw the hacendados being skillfully put out of\r\nbusiness and knew that with their disappearance went the only market in\r\nwhich Indians could sell the land after they got it, or the henequen\r\nleaves if they raised them.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that despite the apparent incongruity of the fact,\r\nthe Indians of Yucatan paid almost no attention to Alvarado’s land\r\ndistribution plans, listening to the alluring official announcements\r\nwith stolid indifference. They attended the festivals which accompanied\r\nthe distribution, but they took up no land grants.\r\n\r\nThere were indeed, many Indians who actually took flight into the\r\ninterior of the state as a result of the efforts to force land upon\r\nthem. The Mexican Indian, of whatever tribe, in reality desires deeply\r\nbut one thing--to be left alone to pursue his half-savage life in\r\nhis own way, an aboriginal ambition which should not be difficult to\r\nunderstand by those who know anything of the North American Indian\r\nof the United States. Socialism, like the responsibilities of land\r\nownership, is beyond his ken and he literally ran away from the offers\r\nof either in Yucatan.\r\n\r\nSome Indians, of course, remained, along with a great number of the\r\nmixed-blood “slaves” who had been imported from the Mexican mainland\r\ninto the state during the boom period of the henequen business. These\r\nwere thoroughly “unionized” in the Mexican sense. That is, they were\r\nforced to pay their poor little three pesos for a big red card which\r\nproclaimed their membership in some union or other, were promised all\r\nthat the human heart could desire--and were allowed to subsist as long\r\nas possible upon the promises. The unions were used to the double\r\nend of ruining the capitalistic landlords and reducing the output of\r\nhenequen so that the price would go higher.\r\n\r\nOn the plantations where these “unionized” workmen remained, the old\r\ntask system, by which each man cut from 2,500 to 3,000 leaves a day,\r\nwas abandoned for a regular “eight-hour day” in which the workmen did\r\nas little as they cared to do, and worked, not under instructions, but\r\nwherever they chose to work. As a result the cutting of leaves was\r\nreduced fully one-half, and the plants near the roads were overcut\r\nwhile those deep in the fields were allowed to blossom and go to seed.\r\nBoth processes killed the henequen, which has to be cut regularly and\r\nskillfully in order to prolong its life of usefulness. For miles the\r\ngreat pole-like blossoms marked the henequen fields like a forest, and\r\nthousands of productive acres went to ruin. Thus Nature’s inevitable\r\nprocess of flowering and decay marked, itself, man’s crass flinging\r\nback of her riches into the dust from which those riches had come in\r\nthe long slow years of his care of her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other forces had been at work, some building the pyramid\r\nof mad ideas and madder methods, others undermining the pyramid’s\r\nfoundations upon the rocks of the conservative past or disintegrating\r\nits mortar of imitation socialistic idealism. Of these forces, the\r\ngreatest was the financial cycle of paper money, “short” drafts and\r\ntowering mortgages against increasing stocks of unsold henequen.\r\n\r\nBy 1915, when Alvarado arrived in Yucatan, the system of paper money\r\nwhich Carranza used to finance his revolution had already engulfed\r\nMexico. Carranza had recently issued his famous dictum that if\r\nGresham’s law (one of the fundamental laws of economics, which holds\r\nthat bad money, in any quantity, inevitably drives out good money) was\r\ninterfering with the circulation of the Carranza paper, Gresham’s law\r\nshould forthwith be repealed by executive decree. Billions of Carranza\r\npaper had been printed, and it was already the circulating medium in\r\nYucatan; gold and bank bills were in hiding. Alvarado decided that the\r\ntime was ripe for a currency of his own, and issued, before he had been\r\nlong in the state, the Reguladora paper money, ostensibly guaranteed by\r\nhemp in storage in Yucatan and in the United States. By decree, this\r\nmoney had to be received at the old value of the silver peso, two for\r\none American dollar.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful idea, except for economic law. The bayonets of\r\nAlvarado’s soldiers helped keep up values for a while, but slowly the\r\ntheory that power can achieve anything the “proletariat” wants was\r\nblasted by fact. Alvarado had promised to redeem his Reguladora paper\r\nin gold or in New York exchange, but he did not bother to back up his\r\npromises by a limitation of the currency to the amount he could redeem,\r\nso that at one time he had $34,000,000 in paper in circulation, against\r\nhenequen stores of half the value, stores which he could not liquidate.\r\nThe currency’s value dropped, cent by cent, then by groups of cents,\r\nand finally it was almost waste paper, like that of Carranza. There was\r\nnot enough henequen in New York, nor enough gold in Yucatan, to redeem\r\nthe paper, and the political nostrum for the economic ill of bad paper\r\ncurrency failed.\r\n\r\nThe failure was colossal enough, in any case, without the financial\r\ncomplication of the currency. Alvarado had closed the ports to all\r\nhemp from the interior that was not consigned to the Reguladora. That\r\nbeneficent monopoly allowed no shipments by rail, and before he got\r\nthrough Alvarado had to close the roads with soldiers, so that no\r\ncarts could reach the port. Meanwhile, he had been boosting the price,\r\ndeliberately and virtually by decree, until, as I have said, it\r\nreached more than 19 cents, as against less than 7 cents a pound which\r\nhad been its price before the Reguladora took charge of the market.\r\n\r\nThis raising of the price cut off a large portion of the market,--and\r\nthat had not been anticipated. Virtually all consumption of henequen\r\nexcept for binder twine ceased. At 19 cents Manila hemp could\r\ncompete--and it is far better hemp. At 19 cents jute cord can compete,\r\nand jute cord is soft and pleasant to handle, and where previously\r\nhenequen cord had been used for big bundles of newspapers and magazines\r\nand mail, jute was substituted--and now the men who handle the bundles\r\nof newspapers and magazines and mail refuse to go back to the rasping\r\nhenequen cord which cuts their hands so uncomfortably.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of henequen was actually reduced to half by this\r\ndeliberate destruction of its market. In spite of the new low prices\r\nto-day, this condition in the general fiber market combines with the\r\ncutting off of the Russian and some of the other European demand to\r\nreduce the world consumption of the Yucatan fiber to about 70 per cent\r\nof what it was prior to 1914. All this loss the Reguladora had to take\r\nup, in addition to the stores which it laid aside to push up the price.\r\nEconomic law was at work, and all the contentious statements that the\r\nprice was going up only in proportion to the rising costs the world\r\nover was answered by the fact that henequen was driven out of the\r\ngeneral fiber market by other hemps which had increased in price, to\r\nbe sure, but had never approached the geometrical progression which\r\nhenequen assumed under the lordly sway of Alvarado’s corner.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, however, it was Mother Nature and Gresham’s\r\nlaw which finally broke the corner. Corners in the products of Nature\r\nhave a way of piling up unexpected responsibilities and finally loosing\r\nunexpected forces which swamp the unwary juggler. So it was in Yucatan.\r\nWith about a year’s supply of fiber in storage in the United States and\r\nMexico, more than half of it mortgaged to American bankers, and with\r\nabout $10,000,000 in Reguladora currency in circulation with nothing\r\nbut photographs of gold stores to guarantee it, Alvarado’s henequen\r\ncorner went the way of all the corners of history. That was in the\r\nspring of 1920 when, after a year of price fluctuation, Nature and the\r\neternal laws of economics began gently wafting the prices downward\r\nuntil they reached the lowest level in fifteen years. Then it was\r\nthat the banking syndicate, which had loaned money against henequen\r\nshipments, foreclosed on 250,000 bales in storage in New York, marking\r\nthe final chapter in the story of Alvarado’s Reguladora experiment.\r\n\r\nWhen the smash came, there was an Association of Henequen Growers which\r\nhad been begging in Yucatan and in the Supreme Court of Mexico for a\r\nchance to take back their business. As the financial difficulties and\r\nthe financial needs of Alvarado’s henchmen increased, the Reguladora\r\nhad all but given up paying any money to the haciendas where the\r\nhenequen was produced. The mule that lived on sawdust up to the day he\r\ndied is a fable of ancient times, but even under such loudly acclaimed\r\n“socialism” as that of Yucatan something has to be paid for a product\r\nwhich is produced and exported. The growers had all but reached the\r\nend of their resources, and Alvarado offered them only paper money,\r\nwhich he would or could not change into gold drafts. So just before the\r\ncrash, to satisfy the clamor, Alvarado took his way to Mexico City and\r\nroyally presented the Reguladora to the Association of the Producers of\r\nHenequen.\r\n\r\nThe hacendados had hardly had time to look over the ruins when those\r\nfinancial interests which had loaned money on hemp that was to sell\r\naround 20 cents a pound foreclosed on those 250,000 bales in New York\r\nand New Orleans, placing thereon a value of 5 cents a pound. Alvarado\r\nwas safe in Mexico City preparing to visit New York in an effort to\r\nget a loan of a few hundred millions for the government of Carranza.\r\nThe hacendados held the sack, and watching the sack was a group of\r\nfinanciers, including the Equitable Trust Company of New York, the\r\nRoyal Bank of Canada and the Interstate Trust Company of New Orleans,\r\nthe latter the Dinkins concern through which most of the loans on the\r\nhenequen had been placed.\r\n\r\nDown in Yucatan the hacendados had their farms back, the Indians\r\nwere returning at night to look things over and see whether the\r\n“socialists” had retired far enough for them to return in safety to\r\ntheir comfortable “slavery”--but nobody had any money. When Alvarado\r\nleft, the hacendados had inherited the Reguladora offices, and had\r\nopened its money vaults. These vaults, photographs of whose gold stocks\r\nhad been circulated by Alvarado to sustain his paper currency, were\r\nquite empty. The haciendas were in terrible condition, and there was no\r\nway of getting funds with which to rebuild and replant them. The only\r\nhope was for capital from outside--Alvarado’s “socialism” had passed on\r\nits way. Of the possible sources of rescue, the chief was in the group\r\nof unhappy banks in New York, New Orleans and Montreal, which were\r\nalready in the henequen business with their 250,000 bales of foreclosed\r\nstock. The second hope was the International Harvester Company, which\r\nneeds henequen in its business. The hacendados chose the banks, and\r\nthe Equitable Trust Company, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Interstate\r\nTrust Co., and the Comisión Reguladora (which still existed in name if\r\nnot in spirit) formed a company, and taking the four initials, called\r\nthemselves the Eric Corporation.\r\n\r\nThere was much rejoicing in Yucatan, for the Eric was going to lend\r\na few more paltry American and Canadian millions and reëstablish the\r\ngreat state industry. The Reguladora (now consisting of the hacendados)\r\nturned in some 300,000 more bales of hemp that were stored at Progreso,\r\nthe Yucatan port, as their part of the capital stock of the Eric, and\r\nthe hacendados went back to work.\r\n\r\nNow one of the peculiar things about “economic ruin” is that it\r\nseldom ruins a business--individuals are the only victims. Yucatan\r\nwas devastated, many thousands of acres put on the non-productive\r\nlist. There was no money to pay labor or to finance the crops, but the\r\nhenequen business went on. To all intents and purposes about all that\r\nhad happened was the elimination of most of the surplus planting which\r\nthere would have been if all had gone along properly and there had been\r\nno Alvarado to corner and destroy the market. Henequen kept on growing\r\non the haciendas and, despite increased costs of handling, it continued\r\nto move to market.\r\n\r\nDon Avelino Montes, a Spaniard who had been the chief buyer of the\r\nInternational Harvester Company, returned from his exile in Cuba and\r\nresumed buying. Don Arturo Pierce, the honorary British vice-consul who\r\ndid the buying for the Plymouth Cordage Company, abandoned consuling\r\nand returned to the henequen trade. The price of Yucatan hemp kept\r\nslumping, but to the surprise of the Eric people, the demand was\r\nsupplied with new hemp, and the Eric’s stocks of old hemp diminished\r\nbut slightly. The money to rehabilitate the Yucatan haciendas was not\r\nforthcoming. The old hemp stock had to be sold first, and the wretched\r\nhacendados refused to coöperate and let the Eric unload.\r\n\r\nHenequen deteriorates, and also it requires insurance, as the many\r\nfires in Progreso and New Orleans at the time testified. The cost\r\nof holding the half million bales of henequen of the Eric is about\r\n$2,500,000 a year, and the price at which it was bought in, plus\r\ninsurance, represents a cost of about 8 cents a pound. The price of\r\nhemp had been stabilized at that very figure by Señores Montes and\r\nPierce, with some outside assistance from New York brokers, but the\r\nsales were made in Yucatan, of new hemp. So the Eric, in righteous\r\nanger, cut the price from 8 cents to 7, and then to 6. The price of\r\nnew hemp also fell, and the hacendados, partners in the Eric, wailed\r\nat the evil which was being done them. However, they continued to sell\r\nthe new crop at the new price, to the Harvester and the Plymouth\r\nand Henry Peabody & Co., and Hanson and Orth, while the gradually\r\ndeteriorating stocks of the Eric went begging. The price was finally\r\ncut to 5 cents, by the Eric. Yucatan has met this price, too, with new\r\nhemp, and because it is still possible to make money out of henequen\r\nwith the price at 4 cents in New York, it seems likely that Yucatan\r\nwill continue to grow henequen, and to sell it. Meanwhile, however,\r\nthe business doctors of the Obregon administration in Mexico City at\r\none time succumbed to the pressure of the unhappy hacendados and even\r\nagreed to try the “Reguladora” experiment all over again, with the\r\ncentral government buying 60 per cent of the henequen crop at 6 cents\r\na pound, and again “controlling” the market, a step in the spiral of\r\ndestruction which had but a brief life and little significance. For\r\nthe story of Yucatan is written and the state and its great industry\r\nare to-day being ground between the wheels of the “capitalism” which\r\nthe beautiful theories of Yucatan’s “socialistic” autocrats sought to\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\nThis is the outcome of Yucatan’s experiments in Alvarado’s brand of\r\nso-called socialism. The price of the fiber is back to less than it\r\nwas before the inflation began, the production has been cut from\r\n1,000,000 bales in 1914 to less than 700,000 in 1919, a decline of 30\r\nper cent, while, taking the potential production from the plantings\r\nup to 1914, the present production is about half of what it would have\r\nbeen if Alvarado had never come to Yucatan. The haciendas are back\r\nin the hands of their original owners, the market is in the hands\r\nof foreign capital, and foreign capital is fighting over the spoils\r\nwith what seems to the Yucatecans utter and cruel disregard of the\r\namenities of gentlemen. The $112,000,000 squeezed from American farmers\r\nand the other untold millions taken from Yucatan by loot, by false\r\nprices in “coöperative stores,” by freight rates on the graft-owned\r\nrailways, and all the other means used by Alvarado’s retainers, have\r\ngone to the enrichment of his group and to the upkeeping of the\r\nCarranza government. No noticeable part of it has remained in Yucatan,\r\nand save for increased wages all around (and the world has surely\r\nlearned that this is not prosperity) no possible profit has remained.\r\nThe spiral cycle is complete, and none has gained, not even the\r\npredatory capitalists, who are unhappily cutting each other’s throats\r\nin an effort to solve the problems into which they were swept by the\r\nmachinations of Alvarado and his henchmen.\r\n\r\nTo-day Yucatan is not free from the domination of the “socialists,” but\r\nthat domination is political, marked by those outrages which have come\r\nto be merely a part of politics in Mexico. Elections are held from time\r\nto time, elections wherein two parties of socialists alone confronted\r\neach other. The battle is bitter, as battles are when brothers are the\r\ncontestants. There is still killing and loot, and women and children\r\nsuffer death and worse in the solution of such glowing political\r\nquestions as whether, we might say, the flag of Yucatan should be all\r\nred or merely red with a black bar across it--its problems are daily\r\nforgotten, for the real issue is only to find out who should have the\r\nnext hand at the graft. Socialistic, to be sure, because all Mexican\r\nmanifestations to-day are masquerading under the name of socialism,\r\nbut quite as little in tune with true socialistic ideals as a battle\r\nbetween two factions in Tammany Hall over the control of New York\r\npolitics would be socialism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Both peonage and the Mexican systems of land distribution are\r\ndiscussed at some length in _The People of Mexico_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                      THE ROMANCE OF MEXICAN OIL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you cross the Mexican border at Laredo, oil enters your\r\nconsciousness--and your clothes. It is everywhere, the thick, odorous\r\n_chapapote_ which furnishes the fuel for Mexico’s locomotives, the\r\nenergy for every Mexican industry which has no water power, the\r\npavements for her streets, and, I am still convinced, the heavy\r\nlubricant with which the sandal-clad brakeman of our train eased an\r\nincidental hot-box. In Tampico, whence comes all the oil of Mexico, the\r\nheavy, black “crude” is even more ubiquitous. It “tars” your shoes when\r\nyou walk abroad; it decorates your clothes when you ride in anybody’s\r\nmotor car or motor boat; it oozes between your toes and sticks in your\r\nhair when you bathe at the beach.\r\n\r\nBut the physical presence of oil is as a whiff from the dead well at\r\nDos Bocas compared to its spiritual domination in all Mexican affairs.\r\nOil is the greatest--I had almost said the only--wealth of Mexico\r\nto-day, its possession the issue of one of the mighty diplomatic\r\nbattles of recent times, while the taxes and graft of it have fed the\r\nwellsprings of ten years of devastating revolutions.\r\n\r\nFar and away and by many fold, oil is the largest single item of\r\nexport of Mexico, and the varied needs of the oil industry and of the\r\nbeneficiaries of that industry dominate the imports as well. To Tampico\r\ngo shiploads of steel, machinery and supplies, and trainloads of soap\r\nand shoes; the factors which build civilization go chiefly and all but\r\nalone, in Mexico, to the oil fields.\r\n\r\nOil dominates the political life of the country not because oil\r\ncompanies or oil millionaires seek to control the Mexican government\r\nbut because the vast unbelievable wealth which is pouring into the\r\ncoffers of that government in taxes and in tribute makes revolution a\r\ngame the stakes of which eclipse any sum or any potentiality of wealth\r\nor power which has ever been known in Mexico.\r\n\r\nOil is the inspiration for the “nationalization” policies which,\r\nforged by foreign radicals and given edge by Mexican cupidity, the\r\nCarrancistas wrote into their Constitution of 1917. This policy of\r\nnationalization, the decrees, the laws, the taxation and the graft\r\nwhich have come in its train, have brought into the field of diplomatic\r\ncontroversy the whole problem of the right of a government to enforce\r\nradical, socialistic or, if you will, bolshevik policies against\r\nforeign interests which may have entered a country and developed it\r\nunder older, more conservative ideals and systems of government.\r\n\r\nFor the oil industry of Mexico is overwhelmingly a foreign enterprise.\r\nAmerican and British and Dutch are the flags which should fly from the\r\noil derricks, for neither Mexico nor Mexicans have had a hand worth\r\nthe naming in the opening of the nation’s richest treasure-house. The\r\nsearch for oil in Mexico has taken on the nature of a race, a battle,\r\nbetween British and American oil interests, a battle not without its\r\ntremendous significance in the world oil situation. But behind this\r\nstruggle, which is still and, we may hope, will remain a friendly one,\r\nloom controversies which are vaster than Mexico or England or America,\r\nproblems on whose solution the very future of our civilization depends.\r\n\r\nFor the real battle in Mexico is not between the two great Anglo-Saxon\r\npowers, but between the powers of light and the powers of darkness. In\r\nMexico’s oil fields to-day is being settled the question of whether\r\nenterprise shall have the right to bring the riches of the earth\r\nto the aid of humanity, of whether industrial power belongs to the\r\nbackward people who by accident find that power in their inept hands,\r\nor to those who can develop and raise it up to the service of mankind.\r\nUpon the issue in Mexico depends not only the usefulness of all the\r\npetroleum resources of that country, but the future development of\r\noil in Colombia, Venezuela, all South America, all Asia, all Africa.\r\nAnd the future of oil development in those lands is the future of the\r\nworld’s oil supply, for there, alone, remain stores sufficient to meet\r\nthe multiplying needs of the world.\r\n\r\nThe solution of this question is vastly complicated. Within the\r\noil situation itself are many problems such as those just noted.\r\nBearing upon it is the tangle of cross-purposes, indirections and\r\nvarying psychologies. That solution is made all but impossible by the\r\nconditions of Mexico to-day, by the flabby weakness of the rulers of\r\nthe Mexican people, by their blindness and selfishness. It has been\r\njammed, time and again, by the failure of the oil companies and their\r\nrepresentatives to assert their rights with a skill equal to that of\r\nthe Mexicans in casting up mountains of controversy out of mole hills\r\nof technicality.\r\n\r\nBut the story of Mexican oil is not all ugly calling of names, not all\r\nmere hopeless tangle. The history of its discovery and development is\r\nrich with color. The romance of an oil field, like the romance of a\r\ngold camp, is always a thrilling tale. But the story of Tampico has\r\nthis other element, for it is indeed the great romance of our race,\r\nthe tale of the white man round the world, the building of gigantic\r\nenterprises, the harnessing of unknown forces, neglected for centuries\r\nby apathetic natives, unlocked by the vision and the enterprise of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nOil began with Tampico, but the story of Tampico antedates oil. It\r\ngoes back to the late 80’s, when one of the great railway builders of\r\nAmerica’s youth left Kansas for Mexico. A. A. Robinson, who surveyed\r\nand built the Santa Fe Railroad from the Kansas prairies to the Pacific\r\nOcean, who swung the track of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad above\r\nthe rapids of the Royal Gorge, was also one of the great builders of\r\nmodern Mexico. Leaving the Santa Fe in 1889, he became president of\r\nthe Mexican Central and built almost the whole of this first standard\r\ngauge line in the country, its branches and tributaries toward the\r\nrich granary of Mexico about Guadalajara in the west, to the mines of\r\nPachuca in the mountains and to Tampico on the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nTampico, a wretched, fever-ridden village beside a beautiful river,\r\nwas no port in those days. The railroad which brought Mr. Robinson to\r\nTampico brought also the engineers who built the great jetties which\r\ncleared the bar and opened Tampico to the world, carried the ores of\r\nPachuca to their markets and began the conscious development of what is\r\nnow the busiest seaport of Mexico. The railroad company built and paid\r\nfor the jetties, and under Mr. Robinson a short-line to Mexico City\r\nwas surveyed and construction was begun, to be halted, in 1908, by the\r\ngovernment merger of the lines.\r\n\r\nAll this seems to lead far away from oil, but it was in 1900, two years\r\nbefore the jetties were completed, that Mr. Robinson invited Edward L.\r\nDoheny and his partner, the late Charles A. Canfield, to Tampico to\r\ndevelop oil wells. Doheny, who had made himself famous and unpopular by\r\ndiscovering petroleum in the middle of Los Angeles, came to examine the\r\nseepages of which Robinson had told him in the hope that he might find\r\nan oil to help the Mexican Central solve its fuel problems, for the\r\ncoal of Mexico is scarce and poor, and all the fuel for the railways\r\nhad to be imported.\r\n\r\nMr. Robinson agreed to buy the oil for fuel if Mr. Doheny developed\r\nit, and it was this encouragement, this faith of two great believers\r\nin Mexico, which brought about the discovery and the later development\r\nof Mexican oil. The board of directors for the Mexican Central later\r\nrepudiated the Robinson contract, but the development of the Mexican\r\noil fields had been begun, and it has never stopped from that day to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1905 that I first visited Tampico. I was the guest of Mr.\r\nRobinson, and as we looked out, one day, over the marshes along the\r\nriver which runs past Tampico to the sea, six miles away, he told me of\r\nhis dreams for his port, of the day when not only the Tampico side of\r\nthe river, but the barren jungle on the other bank would be lined with\r\nwharves and great steamers, greater than any of the coasters and tramps\r\nthat to the number of half a dozen a month were then carrying coal and\r\nore and, amusingly enough as we look back on it now, crude oil from\r\nPennsylvania for use in Tampico’s one industrial establishment, the\r\nWaters-Pierce Refinery.\r\n\r\nI visited Tampico twice again, the last time in 1908. And then this\r\nyear! It was as if the dream of the builder of the port had come true\r\nsince the setting of yesterday’s sun. To-day the river is lined, from\r\nits mouth all the six miles to Tampico and above, with wharves and\r\nwarehouses and hundreds of great tanks of oil, and throughout all this\r\nlength are ships, tankers and cargo boats, while on the hills above are\r\nrefineries and modern towns, and at night the lights are like those\r\nof great cities. The dream, indeed, of a builder of civilization, of\r\ncivilized Mexico, has apparently come true.\r\n\r\nA. A. Robinson is gone, laid away with his honors and his vision\r\nthese four years. But still there is that other American, who twenty\r\nyears ago rode off into the jungles of the coastal plain, saw with\r\nhis own eyes the thick, slimy puddles of asphalt at Ebano, and there\r\ndrilled his first wells. Years later, after his railway contracts were\r\nabrogated, seeking lighter, better oils, Mr. Doheny went, with the\r\nfrontiersman’s unquenchable optimism, nearly a hundred miles farther\r\ninto the jungle till he heard the unforgettable baby murmur and saw\r\nthe unforgettable bubbling spring of viscous black oil of the great\r\nseepages of Cerro Azul, and there located what was to become the\r\ngreatest oil well in the history of the world, the Cerro Azul No. 4.\r\n\r\nOil is the most fascinating of all the treasures of earth. No geologist\r\nhas ever approached the solution of either its source or the contours\r\nor formations within which it lies. An oil spring such as that\r\nwonderful bubbling pool at Cerro Azul may mean the presence of a great\r\nreservoir of oil directly beneath or it may mean that the oil has come\r\na dozen or fifty or a hundred miles along a crack in the mother-rock.\r\nExperience, faith, intuition, these determine the location of a well.\r\nIt was these factors that Doheny brought with him to Mexico, for the\r\nfields which he finally drilled and proved had been rejected by many\r\ngeologists before he came and after.\r\n\r\nAt Ebano, a way-station on the Mexican Central a few miles inland\r\nfrom Tampico this pioneer of the Mexican oil fields found his oil and\r\ndeveloped it, and his success brought hundreds of other prospectors to\r\nEbano in 1900-1902. But Ebano oil is heavy with asphalt, and it was\r\ndangerous to handle in the crude burners of the time because its fumes\r\nignite at low temperatures. Thus, although it is rich in lubricating\r\noils, it was not the petroleum which the world wanted in that day. With\r\nhis contract with the Mexican Central abrogated, virtually without a\r\nmarket excepting for asphalt paving in Mexican cities, Doheny turned\r\nsouthward in search of lighter oils.\r\n\r\nHis trips into the swamps and forests of the _huasteca_ or coastal\r\nplain led him to the great seepages at Cerro Azul, sixty miles below\r\nEbano. It also took him to Juan Casiano where he located his first\r\nwells and in 1908 opened the first of the great producing pools of the\r\nTuxpam district. Drilling and exploration went hand in hand and not\r\nonly Doheny but the British interests of Sir Weetman Pearson (now Lord\r\nCowdray) and other American companies began to make this field famous.\r\n\r\nSince that time the story of the Tampico oil fields has been the\r\nstory of the Americans and other foreigners who followed them. No\r\nMexican name and no Mexican interest are connected with the vast\r\ndevelopment which has come. Yet so vast is the busy zone of production,\r\nso tremendous and so varied the forces and elements working there,\r\nthat one feels something false in this appearance of preponderance\r\nof individuals and of foreigners in the epochal industry of Mexico.\r\nWhen, however, one glimpses the long diplomatic struggle, the legal\r\ntangle, the endless problems which make the Mexican oil question so\r\ncomplicated, one finds that in every phase there are always only\r\nthese foreigners on the one side and the predatory, scheming Mexican\r\nrevolutionary leaders on the other. Never is there a Mexican on the\r\nproduction side, never a foreigner on the side of the elements which\r\nretard production.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Robinson who opened up Mexican oil, and it was Doheny and\r\nother early foreigners who first dared drill, and the foreigners alone\r\nwho in the years past have dared to put millions into pipe lines,\r\nstorage tanks and wonderful fleets of oil-carrying ships. Only they\r\ndared or would dare to go into the sleepy villages of the Vera Cruz\r\nplains and pay fifty cents a day to peons who had lived for generations\r\non less than a quarter as much. Only the foreigners dared give their\r\nlabor a decent wage, dared teach their men to be worth more and more\r\nuntil to-day they pay the commonest peon the equivalent of two American\r\ndollars a day. Only these foreigners dared believe in Mexico, dared\r\ninsist on the good faith of all her faithless governments, dared to go\r\non with their work when all else in Mexico stagnates and cringes before\r\nthe continuing revolutions.\r\n\r\nAnd on the other hand are the Mexicans who govern the land, making it\r\ntheir chief business to bait and loudly curse these same foreigners.\r\nThe name of the foreign oil men is anathema in Mexico to-day, and the\r\nbusiest game of any Mexican official is the oratorical denouncing of\r\nthe sponsors of the industry. But, we cannot forget, these Mexicans\r\nhave not and do not turn a finger to the replacing of great foreign\r\nactivity by any constructive form of Mexican enterprise.\r\n\r\nAt basis the difficulties of the oil companies and the Mexican\r\ngovernments are psychological--and an understanding of those\r\npsychological bases is the rarest flower in the intellectual nosegay\r\nof most of those who discuss either Mexico or oil. First of all is\r\nthe companies’ belligerent insistence on the principles of vested\r\nrights as the first and only basis for the oil discussion--naturally\r\ndistasteful to those whose single idea is to upset those rights.\r\nAnother psychological element is that the foreigners’ very respect for\r\nlaw and the continuity of government and their insistence that Mexico\r\nlive up to their own ideals is in the first place quite beyond the\r\nconception of the Mexicans in power to-day and in the second place such\r\nan attitude is inevitably maddening to the weaker brother whom it seeks\r\nto benefit. Because the foreigners believe in Mexico, the Mexicans will\r\nnot believe in the foreigners.\r\n\r\nAnother disturbing factor is the very success of the oil companies and\r\nof the foreigners whom they employ. I have told, above, something of\r\nthe picture of the Tampico that was and of the Tampico that is. It\r\nhas changed in yet other ways, and most of all in the makeup of her\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 there were perhaps two score Americans and English in the\r\ntown, and the chief industry of the place was--tarpon fishing! To-day\r\nthere are 8,000 Americans and a thousand British and Dutch, and the\r\nswaggering, free-money, noisy, busy atmosphere of the frontier, of\r\nthe oil fields, of the white man on his bully-ragging, destructive,\r\ninconsequential “education” of the dark brother round the world,\r\npermeates the place. Its influence is not academic, but somehow one\r\nfeels that Tampico is a monument to the genius and faith of the\r\nAmericans who made it great. The restless power is there, the restless\r\nmaking over of the world that it may be a better place for the white\r\nyouth of the future to stamp about in, for the dark brothers to build\r\ntheir new homes in.\r\n\r\nYet strangely enough, if you will, it is to my mind largely because\r\nof this same energy, the achievement which this spirit indicates and\r\npredicates, that the difficulties of the foreign oil companies in\r\nMexico have been the sort they are. Their persecution has sprung from\r\nthe realization of the Mexicans that these Americans, these English,\r\nthese Dutch, are doing in Mexico and for Mexico what Mexicans can\r\nnot, dare not, do. The Mexicans from generals to peons, are frantic,\r\nbaffled, rabid, at the wretched Gringoes who dare to pour their\r\nmillions out to drill wells, to build pipe lines and terminals and\r\nships, to take and to convert this black and liquid gold from the soil\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\nOf the hundreds of wells drilled in the Tampico-Tuxpam fields, some\r\nof them the veriest “wildcats” on the flimsiest of chances, hundreds\r\nof them as sure as opening a bank vault, only a half dozen, and none\r\na “wildcat,” have been drilled by Mexicans as individuals or in\r\ncorporations, and not a single ship, not a single storage tank, not\r\na mile of pipe line, is Mexican. Were the Mexican government to take\r\nover the administration of the oil fields to-day, drilling would cease\r\nutterly, to-morrow development would stop and when, a year hence,\r\nit became vital to open more wells, the event would be marked by\r\ngovernment ceremonies and stifling graft.\r\n\r\nEvery one who knows Mexico knows that this is the truth. The Mexicans\r\nthemselves know it, and from the Tampico policeman who howls in\r\noutraged anger when an American motorist refuses to be disturbed by\r\nofficial anathemas, up to the presidential secretaries who devise\r\ncomplicated and childish schemes to force the oil companies into\r\nrecognizing the dignity of Mexican sovereignty, the whole attitude\r\ntoward the oil business has been fraught with effort to maintain that\r\nhazy halo of the weakling, delicate “sensitiveness,” national pride,\r\n_amour propre_.\r\n\r\nWhen I left New York to study Mexican problems for the present writing,\r\nI was convinced that the full facts of the case, on both sides, were to\r\nbe found in the United States; Washington was indeed the battle ground\r\nof lawyers and diplomats. Not until I reached Tampico, however, not\r\nuntil I went out to the oil fields, did I realize that the real problem\r\nis not the question of diplomatic controversy or commercial adjustment.\r\nThere, on the long roads, where but one _peon_ of all the thousands\r\nwhom we passed, took off his hat to the white _patrones_, as every\r\none would have done twelve years ago, I found the touchstone. I knew\r\nthen why reason will not prevail, why justice is non-existent, why no\r\nwhite man has yet been able to feel firm ground beneath his feet in the\r\ndiscussion of the oil problems. These problems have had their rights\r\nand wrongs, as we shall see, but I think that the great difficulty we\r\nat home have had in believing that our own people could be right has\r\nbeen our inability to conceive how, being right, the Mexicans could be\r\nso hostile to them.\r\n\r\nThis, I think, is the point of departure in our misunderstanding of the\r\nMexican situation, especially as it applies to oil. Mexican jealousy\r\nand Mexican realization of the weakness of the national psychology\r\nin great enterprise have set Mexico frantic with the success, the\r\ntriumph, the apparent imperturbability of the great foreign oil\r\ncompanies. This alone has made their hostility to the American\r\ndrillers, linemen and engineers who night and day, month after month\r\nthrough the years of the war, kept the lines open, the oil flowing.\r\nUnarmed, and slaughtered by the score from ambush, grim, unkempt,\r\noften happily drunk in town, these frontiersmen added their bit to\r\nthe fire, to be sure. But note this--it was not the white man’s rough\r\nassertion of superiority or the companies’ “tactless insistence,” but\r\nthe Mexican’s conception of his own inferiority, personal, commercial,\r\npolitical, which lit the flame and kept it burning.\r\n\r\nThe world has entered upon a new industrial era, the age of petroleum.\r\nThe commercial struggle is to-day not the war for markets, but the race\r\nfor oil lands. And of all the petroleum fields known to exist, those in\r\nMexico are the greatest in actual production, the greatest in potential\r\nextent, and the most favorably situated for distribution--all vivified\r\nby the greatest individual oil wells in the records of the world.\r\n\r\nThe story of the development of that oil field is linked with the\r\nhistory of Mexico, inexorably, inevitably a part of it, influencing it,\r\nall but dominating it.\r\n\r\nThe first oil well in Mexico was brought in in 1900; production\r\nbegan on a commercial scale in 1903; about 1904 a British company\r\nsecured its first “concession” for oil drilling; in 1905 the status of\r\npetroleum as belonging to the owner of the surface land was definitely\r\nsettled, and development began on a large scale; in 1912 the Madero\r\ngovernment established, over the mild protests of the producing\r\ncompanies, the principle of special taxation on the oil business; in\r\n1914 President Huerta extracted 200,000 Mexican pesos from an American\r\noil representative in Mexico City, and the oil company, under advice\r\nof the Department of State, repudiated his draft and paid the money to\r\nCarranza; in 1914 the principle of “shaking down” the oil companies\r\nwas originated by Candido Aguilar (later son-in-law of Carranza), who\r\nmade a mild $10,000 collection; in 1915 Manuel Pelaez made his first\r\ncall for tribute, some $1,500, under the exchange conditions of the\r\nday, which the companies paid with the advice of the American State\r\nDepartment and the American Ambassador, a precedent which later netted\r\nPelaez a regular $30,000 a month; in 1915 Carranza began to devote the\r\nbrains of his finance minister, Luis Cabrera, to devising oil taxes,\r\nwith the result that to-day the foreign oil companies pay a total of\r\nnearly $4,000,000 a month, derived from export taxes on the product,\r\nstamp taxes on their business, occupation taxes on their offices,\r\nharbor taxes on their ships, customs duties on their supplies,\r\netc.; in 1916 Carranza issued the decree requiring foreigners who\r\ndid business in Mexico to renounce their rights of recourse to their\r\nhome government; in 1917 came the new Mexican constitution declaring\r\nall petroleum in the subsoil the property of the nation; in 1919 the\r\ndrilling of new wells was stopped unless the companies agreed to accept\r\nthis principle of nationalization; in 1919 the second of the big oil\r\npools went to salt water and the need of new drilling to keep up the\r\nsupply of oil (and the Mexican taxes) became imperative; in January,\r\n1920, temporary drilling permits were issued by Carranza; in May, 1920,\r\nCarranza was overthrown and murdered in the revolution of Obregon, said\r\nto have been financed by certain oil interests; in 1921 Obregon doubled\r\nthe oil taxes, bringing about a shutdown, temporary but salutary; in\r\n1921 drilling is going on, however, and the shipment of oil continues.\r\n\r\nWhile drilling is going on in small sections in spite of obstacles,\r\nthe full development of the petroleum fields of Mexico waits on the\r\nfinal decision of the confiscatory provisions of Carranza, whose dead\r\nhand still guides the policies of his successors along the road of\r\nanti-foreignism. In 1921, then, the oil companies are still uncertain\r\nof their status, still the objects of astonishing taxation, still\r\nsubject to government annoyance and graft, still buying, in taxes and\r\nannoyances, the “privilege” of working their properties.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the foreign companies are probably the greatest\r\ninstallation in any single oil field in the world. The investment in\r\npipe lines, pumping stations, storage tanks, refineries, terminals and\r\nships represents close on $750,000,000; the length of the 161 pipe\r\nlines (practically all of them eight or ten inches in diameter) totals\r\nnearly 1,000 miles, while nearly 1,500 steel tanks, with a capacity of\r\n60,000,000 barrels, furnish enough storage to fill a thousand ships.\r\nThrough the pipe lines can pass, under high pressure, 750,000 barrels\r\na day, although the average production for 1920 was about half of this\r\namount.\r\n\r\nIn the Mexican fields in April, 1920, the latest date for which figures\r\nare available, there were 304 wells in production, 148 located and 123\r\ndrilling. The total of commercially unproductive wells to that date\r\nwas 464, including only 35 which showed oil in too small quantities.\r\nThree-fifths of all the wells drilled in Mexico have been dry holes,\r\nand to-day of 1,113 wells drilled and projected, only 75 which have\r\nactually flowed oil have run out of production. These last, however,\r\ninclude some of the greatest in the history of the petroleum industry.\r\n\r\nThe vast investment and plant in the Tampico-Tuxpam fields produced\r\nin 1920 over 140,000,000 barrels of oil, one-fourth of all that\r\nwas produced in the entire world, equaling some 40 per cent of the\r\nproduction of all the fields in the United States. The 1920 production\r\nwas nearly five times that of 1913, when less than 26,000,000 barrels\r\nwere extracted from the Mexican wells, and when Mexico’s total oil\r\noutput was only one-ninth that of the United States and contributed\r\nless than one-twelfth to the production of the world. The growth has\r\nbeen steady and by tremendous strides, for when the pressure of war was\r\non, the men who were taking out Mexican oil built up a production which\r\nbetween 1916 and 1917 brought an increase of 40 per cent and began a\r\ndevelopment that despite superhuman difficulties gained such momentum\r\nthat between 1919 and 1920 the increase was 60 per cent.\r\n\r\nOn your map you will easily find, on the eastern shore of Mexico, the\r\ncity of Tampico, located in the center of the palm of the hand with\r\nwhich Mexico grasps the great Gulf. A little to the south you will\r\nfind, with difficulty, the town of Tuxpam, midway between Tampico and\r\nVera Cruz. From Tampico directly south to a few miles west of Tuxpam\r\nruns the “line” along which lies virtually all the oil yet developed\r\nin commercial quantities in Mexico. The “line” is thirty-five miles\r\nlong; the great producing territory never extended over twenty miles;\r\nmomentarily the section which is giving the oil of the Tuxpam district\r\nis along ten miles in the middle of the “line”--and the territory is\r\nhardly a half mile broad at its greatest width. This section produced\r\nin the past ten years 500,000,000 barrels of oil. In 1920 it produced\r\nabout 140,000,000 barrels, close to one-quarter of all the oil taken\r\nfrom all the wells in the world.\r\n\r\nNow trace the “line” north to Texas and Oklahoma--it is an extension\r\nof the great mid-continent field of the United States. Now go south,\r\nthrough the old Furbero field, swing a little in toward the Gulf,\r\nand south of Vera Cruz, on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, you will find\r\nMinatitlan, the site of early drillings, and of the refinery of the\r\nMexican Eagle Oil Company. Still south, on the “line,” and you will\r\nfind, if your map is large enough, the village of Macuspana, in the\r\nstate of Tabasco. Here oil of a grade so fine that the natives burn\r\nthe crude seepage in their lamps has been oozing through the soil for\r\ncenturies, and here, long ago, the British drilled many test holes. The\r\n“line” runs true, skirting the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nStill more. There are oil seepages on the West Coast, an extension,\r\nperhaps, of our California fields. Other indications have been found,\r\neven far inland, and indeed on the Gulf side, the “line” does not by\r\nany means cover the seepages, even of the coastal plain. All this\r\nsection, off into the interior toward the states of Puebla and\r\nHidalgo, has been leased for oil. But production sticks to the “line.”\r\n\r\nThe Tuxpam field, the heart of the “line,” will ultimately go to salt\r\nwater. Of this there is no question. Every pool of oil that has been\r\ndrained--now three in number--has given its 100,000,000 barrels, and\r\nthe steaming, brackish water, still under terrific pressure, has wiped\r\nout the property, often between sunset and sunrise--a few hours between\r\n50,000 barrels a day and nothing. Dos Bocas at the northernmost end\r\nof the “line,” came in on July 4, 1906, hailed as the greatest well\r\nof history, blew out her casing, caught fire and burned for months,\r\na torch of gas and flame 850 feet high, till (if it was oil and not\r\ngas she burned) she had easily spent her 100,000,000 barrels. Another\r\ngreat British well, Portrero del Llano No. 4, flowed eight years,\r\ngiving nearly her 100,000,000 to industry, and went to salt water over\r\nnight. The Casiano field, of the Doheny interests, paid a similar toll.\r\nCerro Azul No. 4 of the same company came in at a full rate of 162,000\r\nbarrels a day. She has never been allowed to flow full, for the whole\r\nfield is owned by the company, and the pool is considered safe from\r\ndrainage. Further south, the Doheny companies have, in 1921, opened\r\nanother vast field, the Chapapote Nuñez--but that, still, is “on the\r\nline.”\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the Naranjos field has been showing salt water;\r\nthe Chinampa, with a hundred wells located on a relatively few acres,\r\nis being drained at top speed, and salt water has been cutting closer\r\nin at its edges. To-day the Zacamixtle camp, the last of the “line,”\r\nwhich was drilled like mad by scores of crews putting down wells that\r\ncost in Mexico $100,000 each, has been narrowed to a strip of an oil\r\nriver only a few hundred yards wide.\r\n\r\nWith Chinampa and Zacamixtle gone, only the Cerro Azul, the sixty\r\nsquare miles of the Chapapote field, and the adjacent Toteco pool will\r\nremain on the “line” with no reserves save to the south, in a territory\r\nrecently proved by the “Toteco” and “Chapapote” districts, or to the\r\nnorth, in the Tampico or Panuco field proper. This last is a heavy oil\r\nsection, and here, too, the largest portion of the territory is owned\r\nby the Doheny companies.\r\n\r\nWhy, with this dwindling field, this steady reduction in reserves,\r\nhas there not been more development in Mexico? You know the basic\r\nanswer--revolution. But through revolution and graft and theft and\r\nmurder the American operators in the oil fields, working for British\r\nand American companies, have kept on the job. Revolution is not the\r\nonly answer.\r\n\r\nCarranza, when he became president of Mexico, cast envious eyes toward\r\nthe oil fields, and sought to make them his own, for loot and for\r\ngraft, and not for conservation, be it noted here. He “nationalized”\r\npetroleum, by his new constitution, and tried to force the companies\r\nto give up their properties. They did not surrender, in fact or in\r\nprinciple, and for five years have fought for their rights, and for\r\nwhat they believe is the hope of oil development in all the backward\r\nlands of the globe.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 Carranza stopped the drilling of new wells, in an effort to\r\nforce the companies to submit to his decrees, and not until Tepetate\r\nand Juan Casiano went to salt water and the tax returns of nearly\r\n$30,000,000 a year (at that time) were direly threatened, did he give\r\ntemporary permits for drilling. He might fight for the nationalization\r\nof the oil, but he was routed by the danger to the vast sum upon\r\nwhich he ran his government and upon which his generals and favorites\r\nfattened and grew rich.\r\n\r\nThus in the oil fields drilling has been resumed. But off the “line”\r\nthere is virtually no drilling, none of the “wild-catting” which is the\r\nlife of the oil industry. Until the new government, if it ever does of\r\nits own free will, loosens the death-grip of Carranza, the oil industry\r\nwill remain paralyzed and confined to its narrow, shrinking bed between\r\nTampico and Tuxpam.\r\n\r\nBut why does Mexico go on? Why does she see so little of the way before\r\nher? The situation is complicated by many factors, two of which stand\r\nout in relief. These are the support given the Carranza ideas first by\r\nthe British companies and second by some new American companies. The\r\nBritish needs in Mexico have from time to time been identical with the\r\nAmerican, and then the two have worked together, but the British occupy\r\na peculiar position, going back to the Madero revolution of 1910-11. At\r\nthat time the Mexican Eagle company (which is a Mexican corporation)\r\nwas caught with a number of the old Diaz “reactionaries” as its company\r\nofficials, and it was also the holder of the hated Diaz “concessions.”\r\nAs a result it had to walk the chalk line very carefully under both\r\nMadero and Carranza, a condition which has always made its position\r\nweaker than the American. The large local business of the Eagle\r\nCompany, in refined gasoline and oils, as well as in fuel oil, has also\r\ncomplicated the matter. It was due to these and similar factors that\r\nthe Eagle Company placed itself under the “protection” of the Carranza\r\ndecrees when they were first issued, although with protests, both\r\nlegal and diplomatic. With a single American exception, the English\r\ninterests were the only ones which gave any comfort to those early\r\nCarranza plans. Upon their support the former president built many of\r\nhis subsequent activities, including the ruling on drilling permits.\r\nHe gave these permits to the Eagle Company without conditions, at the\r\nvery time withholding them from the “unfriendly” Americans under a\r\ndemand for a written waiver of all protest against future petroleum\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe second form of support which the Mexican governments obtained is\r\nmore recent, and more complicated. Under the Carranza decrees oil lands\r\nwere open to “denouncement” (or filing of claims) and the taking out\r\nof a “denouncement” even to protect one’s own property was taken as an\r\nunqualified recognition of the right of Mexico in confiscating the oil\r\nrights of that property. The American and British companies united in\r\nan agreement not to denounce their own lands and not to buy or lease\r\ndenouncements upon any other lands.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, some new American interests, which had had other experience\r\nin oil, entered the Mexican field. They spent some $500,000 in looking\r\nup titles to the properties and leases held by the old companies. They\r\nfound many defects, for the inheritance laws, the poor records and the\r\nnegligible value of the properties as farm lands make questionable\r\ntitles the commonplace of the oil game in Mexico. Where there was an\r\napparently defective title, these interests acquired the outstanding\r\nlien, and so laid claim to some of the finest producing lots.\r\n\r\nSo far the plan was a not unexpected move toward getting a hand in\r\nthe oil game, a chance to sit in with big stakes alongside the big\r\ncompanies. The new elements, however, next “denounced” their new claims\r\nbefore the Carranza government, thus placing themselves quite outside\r\nthe old-crowd oil camp. This “denouncing” of their properties brought\r\nthem many favors from Carranza officials, but it made negotiation with\r\nthe old companies difficult.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican oil problem, in its simplest, is three-fold. It has to\r\ndo, first, with the nationalization of the petroleum in the subsoil,\r\nwhich threatens to wipe out vested property; second, with the question\r\nof taxation, which may at any time, and indeed actually threatens to\r\nbecome confiscatory; third, with the problem of concessions which are\r\nto-day the most obvious form of political graft and to-morrow may\r\nprecipitate a Mexican war over petroleum rights.\r\n\r\nFirst, the nationalization of petroleum. The Constitution of 1917,\r\nadopted by Carranza, and continued by de la Huerta and Obregon,\r\ndefinitely declares petroleum the property of the nation. In the grants\r\nof land made by the Spanish crown (the basis of all land titles in\r\nMexico to-day), gold, silver and other metals were especially reserved\r\nas the property of the king, and in colonial times and since have been\r\nworked only by special permission or grant under “denouncement,” quite\r\nindependently of the owner of the land. Neither coal nor oil was known\r\nto commerce in Spanish times, but in 1884, when the mining laws were\r\nrevised, the Mexican government as inheritor of the rights of the Crown\r\nof Spain and retaining, as it did and does, the royal control over gold\r\nand silver, specifically stated that coal and oil belonged to the owner\r\nof the surface. This was confirmed later in the mining laws of 1892.\r\nIn 1905, after oil was discovered and certain concessions for drilling\r\nhad been issued to Sir Weetman Pearson (now Lord Cowdray), head of the\r\nMexican Eagle Oil Company, an effort was made to have oil declared\r\nthe property of the nation, like gold and silver, and thus subject\r\nto concession and denouncement. This was opposed by the American\r\ninterests, which held no concessions. The issue was decided virtually\r\nunanimously by the Academy of Jurisprudence, and in the mining laws of\r\n1909 the title to oil was definitely and unequivocably vested in the\r\ntitle to the surface soil.\r\n\r\nUntil 1917, the vast development of Mexican oil fields went on apace,\r\nbased on the old property rights and apparently safe from molestation.\r\nCarranza switched the matter completely around by the simple expedient\r\nof adding oil to the list of minerals which are national property and\r\nplacing the new ruling in that famous Article 27 which contains most of\r\nthe anti-foreign provisions of the new constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican defenses of this action are two. The primary thesis is\r\nthat the subsoil has always belonged to the government, whether king\r\nor republic, and that it was beyond the power of ministers or courts\r\nor legislatures to alienate those rights. In other words, Mexico is\r\nonly “taking back her own.” The opposition to this is on the basis\r\nof vested rights, on the long periods during which the owners of the\r\nlands had actually enjoyed possession of the subsoil, paying taxes\r\non full valuations, and on the virtual obligation of contract of all\r\nMexican governments to support developments under the laws of their\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nThe other contention, more general and yet with a stronger appeal to\r\nmodern radicals, was that such nationalization was in line with the\r\ntrend of the times, a trend later manifested in the Russian revolution.\r\nCandido Aguilar, then Carranza’s foreign minister, gave voice to this\r\nphase in his note of August 12, 1918, to the British Foreign Office,\r\nwhere he stated that “the modern conception of property is that it is a\r\nsocial function bound closely to the prosperity of the State.”\r\n\r\nBoth these contentions might in fact be worthy of consideration if\r\nthe government of Mexico were of a character to be trusted, if it were\r\nindeed genuinely devoted to any sincere ideals of social reform, if it\r\nwere truly interested in the conservation of the nation’s resources for\r\nthe benefit of the people. But the Mexican governments have been none\r\nof these things, truly believe none of these things. The radicalism\r\nof Mexico, the socialism of Mexico, are means to an end, not ends in\r\nthemselves, means to power and position, for loot and for the pelf\r\nwhich goes into private pockets and not even into national coffers.\r\n\r\nCertainly if government could be depended on, the idea of paying\r\nfixed royalties to a national treasury is financially preferable to\r\ndickering with individuals, and obviously more businesslike. But since\r\noil has been known, the great organizations which handle the product\r\nhave been accustomed to dealing with private owners; it is a game they\r\nknow, a business they understand. In Mexico there is the other factor\r\nwhich one can never lose sight of, and that is that government control\r\nmeans graft, favoritism, chicanery, the meddling of foreigners and big\r\nbusiness in the very heart of the councils of government. And those\r\nthings, until now avoided, must never come into being.\r\n\r\nIn the final analysis, the proposed nationalization of petroleum has\r\nnever been a conservation measure, the only excuse (to radical or to\r\nconservative) for its promulgation. The Mexican governments, from\r\nCarranza to Obregon, accepted “denouncements” upon petroleum lands\r\nalready developed, granted vast concessions for drilling, on a royalty\r\narrangement with the government, in so-called navigable streams\r\nand other “federal zones,” and in every way in their power carried\r\non a _redistribution_ of petroleum titles. This single fact of the\r\ngovernment acceptance of such denouncements and concessions indicates\r\nthat the intention is not to conserve, but to get a new deal with\r\nsomebody besides the Gringoes and the Indians who own the oil lands\r\nsitting around the table.\r\n\r\nThe whole interpretation of the oil features of Article 27 seems at\r\nvariance with the ideas of genuine radicals as completely as it is at\r\nvariance with the ideas of dyed-in-the-wool conservatives who still\r\ndare talk of “vested rights.” The effect of the enforcement of the\r\nnationalization plan would be first to change royalty payments from\r\nthe land owners to the government and second to move the dealings for\r\noil leases from the open field and the negotiations of plain buying\r\nand selling to the conferences of government officials where honor is\r\nto-day a more commercial commodity than land, and where the proportions\r\nof lease money to graft would be as one to ten. It would indeed, bring\r\non the era of concessions and favoritism with a vengeance, and the\r\ndismal pictures of the foreigners’ corruption and exploitation of\r\nMexico would become a bitter reality.\r\n\r\nAt present, the chief hope of avoidance of such a condition lies in\r\nArticle 14 of the same Constitution of 1917, which declares that none\r\nof the provisions of that instrument shall be construed as being\r\nretroactive. The interpretation of non-retroactivity has been the\r\nsubject of much discussion. At one time Carranza’s foreign minister\r\ntold the oil companies that it should be understood to mean that the\r\ngovernment would not collect for the oil already extracted. At other\r\ntimes it has been held that the expropriation of petroleum rights would\r\nnot affect the properties where wells were opened prior to May 1st,\r\n1917; then not to land acquired for drilling purposes before that date.\r\nIt was this detail which was taken up by the Mexican Supreme Court in\r\nAugust, 1921. But after years of fighting single incidents, and working\r\nalong the theory that American companies could demand only their own\r\nrights, the issue has actually broadened to the whole question of\r\nproperty rights of Mexicans as well as foreigners. There are millions\r\nof acres of potential petroleum land in Mexico, not one per cent of\r\nwhich is owned or leased by foreigners, and all this would be wiped\r\nout, along with foreign properties, if the oil were declared definitely\r\nconfiscated to the nation, or even if merely the “oil” lands were\r\nexempted.\r\n\r\nWere non-retroactivity interpreted to nationalize only the oil and\r\ncoal in federal lands to which no title had ever been given to private\r\nindividuals, the vested rights of land owners would be protected\r\nwhether petroleum had been discovered on the property or not. Such\r\nan idea of nationalization would approximate the control of oil in\r\nnational lands in the United States under the new leasing laws. It is\r\nthis interpretation which the oil companies and the Mexican land owners\r\nare seeking, and which has not been touched by the Mexican Supreme\r\nCourt decisions noted above.\r\n\r\nThe second issue in the oil controversy is taxation. Until the\r\n1921 temporary increase, export duties on oil were collected at a\r\ntheoretical rate of 15 per cent of its value. This valuation is\r\nsupposedly on the basis of sales of oil in Mexico. There are hundreds\r\nof such sales, but their prices are not taken, and arbitrary estimates\r\nostensibly based on the prices for which oil is sold abroad, less\r\nanother arbitrary allowance for transportation, are the criteria. The\r\nresults of this system have been confusing to the exporters, to say the\r\nleast. Some of the lower grades of oil, for instance, were actually\r\npaying, not 15 per cent of their value, but 40 or 50 per cent. The\r\nvaluations fluctuate also according to government caprice and the need\r\nof tax money; the result is another difficulty in making close prices\r\nto consumers, which in the end all must feel in the price of gasoline.\r\nA peculiar tax difficulty of the oil companies was over an exact\r\ndoubling of the valuations and thus of the taxes, made by the Carranza\r\ngovernment a few days before it fell--an increased tax which the de\r\nla Huerta and Obregon governments have sought to collect. Still more\r\nrecent is the virtual doubling of oil taxes which shut in many of the\r\nwells during July, 1921.\r\n\r\nThe direct oil taxes are now about $2,000,000 a month, so that the\r\ndoubling is an item of no small moment. At present no immediate\r\nsolution of the tax difficulties is in sight, and the companies have\r\nbeen split by favoritism into two camps. One is largely British,\r\nwhich finds it profitable to accept the decrees. The other is largely\r\nAmerican and finds the enforcement of the new regulations oppressive.\r\nSome plans for relief have been discussed. One of the proposed oil\r\nbills based on Article 27 interprets it not as nationalizing petroleum,\r\nbut as nationalizing the right of taxation, taking all tax privileges\r\nfrom the states and vesting them in the federal power. The idea would\r\nbe to provide a single direct tax on petroleum extracted from the soil\r\ninstead of upon that exported. Apparently this tends toward a solution\r\nof the tax question. But here again enters the difficulty of dealing\r\nwith Mexicans, for such a direct tax would be without recourse, until\r\nits provisions became confiscatory, while at present the companies have\r\nat least a chance of defense in protests against arbitrary valuations.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding fact in the tax situation, as in the nationalization\r\nquestion, is the bad faith of Mexican government. The much discussed\r\nreforms are non-existent, and government in Mexico is for the benefit,\r\nnot of the governed, but of those who rule, and taxes fill not the\r\ntreasury but the pockets of officials, and appropriations are not for\r\nschools and civic welfare, but for the army and “public works,” where\r\ngraft is so colossal that it passes the conception of citizens of\r\nsimpler lands.\r\n\r\nThe third element of the Mexican oil problem has to do with\r\nconcessions. This is a phase of nationalization, but to-day it has\r\ntaken on an importance which recently obscured other issues. The\r\ngovernment had issued a number of what are called “federal zone\r\nconcessions,” giving to individuals and companies the right to explore\r\nand extract oil from the rivers, lakes, etc. The federal zones are\r\nnarrow strips along the seashore and navigable rivers on which an\r\neasement has been reserved for the public use. The American oil\r\ncompanies contend that this mere easement cannot be converted into\r\nabsolute ownership, which is the effect when the government grants to\r\nthird parties the right to drill wells there and thus to tap the pools\r\nof oil which the companies have discovered and developed and on which\r\nthey are paying rentals to land owners.\r\n\r\nThere were a few oil concessions under Diaz, practically all to English\r\ncompanies. One of the great shibboleths of the Madero revolution was\r\nthe wiping out of the system of concessions, so no more were given\r\nuntil toward the end of the Carranza régime. Beginning then, becoming\r\nalmost an orgy in the brief rule of de la Huerta, and continuing\r\ninto the days of Obregon, concessions have become common, some\r\ngoing indirectly to a few American companies, many to the British\r\ncorporations and more to Mexican favorites of the ruling group. The\r\nconcessions issued cover practically every river and semi-arid gully\r\n(regarded as a “navigable stream” for the purposes of the concession)\r\nin the whole Tampico-Tuxpam field, a stretching of the “federal zone”\r\nidea in order to make possible the penetration of the producing fields\r\nby concessionaires.\r\n\r\nOther concessions are of different sort. Under de la Huerta one was\r\nissued giving the right to explore rivers, lakes and government lands\r\nover the entire republic, with preferential drilling rights up to a\r\nproduction of 400,000,000 barrels per year, the chief consideration\r\nbeing a return to the Mexican government of 40 per cent of the gross\r\nvalue of the oil found. Another, to a company, also American, gives\r\nrights to explore Lower California and other West Coast states, with\r\nthe privilege of denouncing not only government lands, but private\r\nproperties as well--the return to the government in this case is 10 per\r\ncent of the gross.\r\n\r\nThe concession feature of the oil question, like the others which I\r\nhave described, has its rights and its wrongs, but the fact of giving\r\nconcessions, and in such blanket form, to take oil from the lands of\r\nprivate property holders, is in itself proof of but one thing--the\r\nintention of the Mexican government, not to conserve its resources\r\nof oil for the benefit of its people and the generations yet unborn,\r\nbut to get out of the oil business as much as possible as quickly as\r\npossible--and solely for itself and its favorites.\r\n\r\nThe final phase of the oil problem in particular and of the entire\r\nMexican question in general is anti-foreignism. Article 27 of the\r\nnew constitution contains a number of anti-foreign provisions other\r\nthan petroleum nationalization. One is that only Mexican citizens may\r\ndevelop oil (and other properties) in the republic. Another section of\r\nthe Constitution, as I have mentioned, gives this provision force by\r\nrequiring that foreigners who sought to work such properties should\r\nappear before a government department and waive all rights of appeal\r\nto their home government for protection. This and other anti-foreign\r\nprovisions are summed up in the so-called “Carranza Doctrine,” one of\r\nthe interesting developments of his picturesque reign. This has been\r\nstated as follows:\r\n\r\n “No individual should aspire to a better situation than that of the\r\n citizens of the country to which he goes; legislation should be\r\n general and abstain from distinctions on account of nationality.\r\n Neither the power of nations nor their diplomacy should serve for\r\n the protection of particular interests or to exert pressure upon the\r\n governments of weak peoples with the end of obtaining modifications of\r\n laws which are disagreeable to the subjects of a powerful country.”\r\n\r\nThe world outside largely persists in taking Mexican professions at\r\ntheir face value, and in solemnly accepting the beautiful Mexican laws\r\nand the beautiful Mexican arguments as literally true. On this point\r\nI have quoted elsewhere the words of a great Mexican publicist, who\r\nhas written: “The carpet baggers of Mexico have traditions rooted as\r\nfar back as colonial times. They combine the shrewd and subtle wit\r\nof the Indian with the grandiose words of modern civilization, with\r\nwhich they have gained the sympathy of uninformed outsiders.” Our own\r\nState Department has answered the “Carranza Doctrine” in no uncertain\r\nterms and once wrote that “the Department is of the opinion that ...\r\nan attempt is being made to coerce American companies ... to admit in\r\nadvance ... the correctness of the contention of the Mexican government\r\nin the matter of ownership of oil deposits, against which the American\r\ngovernment has made solemn protest as threatening confiscation of\r\nrights legally acquired by American citizens.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is no reason to doubt that virtually all of the oil\r\ndecrees of Carranza, all the rulings of his ministers, all the\r\nregulations which have been enforced with such insistence on petty\r\ndetails have been, first, appeals to sentimentalism abroad and, second,\r\nchildish expedients to force recognition by the foreigners of some\r\nsort--any sort--of superiority in the Mexicans. In the last, so well\r\nset forth in the State Department message quoted just above, lies the\r\nbasic cause of the failure of the companies to reach an agreement with\r\nthe Mexican government. Every willingness to discuss a point, every\r\nslackening of their demands, has been accepted, not as an approach to\r\na solution, but as a weak concession to Mexican “national pride” and\r\npersonal dignity.\r\n\r\nThere are two remaining reasons why the oil question remains unsettled.\r\nThey are extremely practical,--loot and incompetence. Of the former,\r\nGeorge Agnew Chamberlain, the novelist, recently American Consul\r\nGeneral in Mexico City, has written in his book, “Is Mexico Worth\r\nSaving?” that:\r\n\r\n “Today it is taken as a matter of course that ninety per cent of all\r\n Mexican officials in positions of trust are openly corrupt and will\r\n inevitably continue so until controlled by some greater power than\r\n any single faction of their peers.... The graft of Mexico is outright\r\n loot; its effect is to open simultaneously all the arteries of the\r\n body politic and to pour the entire life blood of the nation into the\r\n gullets of the group in power.”\r\n\r\nThe oil companies are the ripest prey for loot in all Mexico. Their\r\nindividual employees pay graft of certain kinds--of that I have no\r\ndoubt, although there is vigorous and official denial. The companies\r\nthemselves, however, pay a tribute, through the channels of astonishing\r\ntaxation and contributions to public works, which is no less than the\r\nbuying of the privilege of doing business. Another phase appears in the\r\ngossip which is general that one of the English companies materially\r\naided the Obregon revolution--certainly every moneyed interest in\r\nMexico had ample opportunity to do so. The American companies were,\r\nafter Obregon’s occupation of Mexico City, “shaken down” for about\r\n$1,000,000 which was credited against taxes--and the taxes afterwards\r\nproportionately increased!\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the companies have resisted the temptation to ease their\r\nway along the broader paths of high government by the voluntary use of\r\nmoney--they have generally confined their expenses to the ample totals\r\nof taxes and assessments. It is for this reason that one of the most\r\nserious phases of the Mexican congressional discussion of petroleum\r\nlegislation is that practically every member of the Mexican congress\r\nexpects “his,” and when it is not forthcoming, will see to it that\r\nnothing favorable to the foreign companies finds its way to the statute\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nLastly, incompetence. Perhaps the most appalling factor of the whole\r\nMexican situation is the utter and profound ignorance of the men in\r\ncontrol of the national affairs, men to whom the culture, the very\r\nprocedure, of modern civilization are as a closed book. I believe that\r\nthe oil problem is made serious chiefly because the Mexicans who might\r\notherwise be willing to solve it are so uneducated, so limited in\r\nviewpoint and understanding, that they cannot conceive of the vast sums\r\nof money which must be invested in pipe lines, storage tanks, pumping\r\nstations, wharves and ships and refineries before the oil taken from\r\ntheir country’s soil becomes the fabulous treasure of which they hear\r\nso much. They seem utterly incapable of grasping the fundamentals of\r\ntheir national problems; the pity of the condition almost obscures the\r\nsignificance of the fact. It has not been easy for me to explain the\r\noil problem in its simplest phases to Americans, yet in this chapter\r\nyou who have read it have learned more than the floor leaders of the\r\nMexican congress will ever know.\r\n\r\nIt is through this forest of ignorance, this slime of graft, that the\r\nforeign oil companies are making their way. They have committed many\r\nmistakes in their handling of the situation, selfish mistakes, mistakes\r\nof ignorance, but the struggle has been against forces whose depravity\r\nhas been literally unbelievable. Personally, I am no fire-eater, but I\r\nhave seen much of Mexico and I have seen something of the psychology\r\nof depravity, and I believe that the last lingering hope of Mexican\r\nadaptability to world conditions lies in Mexican recognition of the\r\nneed of grasping truth rather than theory, of facing facts with manly\r\nfaith in Mexico and in Mexican ability to solve her problems as other\r\nnations solve theirs, by honesty and patriotism and not by graft and\r\npersonalism. This attitude the oil companies have nurtured, and in this\r\ntheir policy has been a policy of weakness. Seeking here an outlet\r\nfor the day, there a hope for the morrow, they have put a premium on\r\nMexican dishonesty, given a prize for Mexican argumentative skill. I\r\nknow some of the problems the companies have faced, I know the need for\r\noil during the war, I have written here something of the magnificence\r\nof their achievement, but for all that, I hold that they have had much\r\nto do with the vacillation, the inefficiency, the watery, grafting\r\npolicy of the Mexican governments from Carranza to Obregon. They have\r\nhad a large part in making such a policy successful by not refusing\r\nunjust demands firmly and directly, by not challenging Carranza to\r\nclose the oil fields, by not taking a mighty loss to save the endless\r\nleak of graft and taxes and cynical legislation which is their heritage\r\nto-day. Even yet their policy is one of conciliation to Obregon, the\r\nnewest president; still they are offering compromise, still giving the\r\nsubtle Mexican mind to understand that perhaps they might agree to\r\nArticle 27, perhaps they might accept a little higher taxation, perhaps\r\nthey would like a few concessions, perhaps they might be counted on to\r\nget the hopefully predicted Mexican loan.\r\n\r\nAll this is the last phase of the complicated problem. We have said,\r\nin days gone by, that this is the problem of the oil companies, that\r\ntheirs is the gain and theirs should be the cost. But if I have\r\nsucceeded here I have conveyed an idea of the breadth of the oil\r\nproblem. It is no longer a question of whether the American State\r\nDepartment is making the proper moves to support honest and industrious\r\nAmerican investors and workers abroad. It is no longer the academic\r\nproblem of whether the oil companies are handling their business in an\r\nintelligent and efficient manner. The problem is ours, yours and mine,\r\nof you in Kansas, of me in New York, of our cousins in England and\r\nChina. It is the problem of the chap who runs a Ford and of the man who\r\nis cutting our freight bills by renting us a truck, of the steamship\r\ncompany which is carrying our goods, of the captain of the battleship\r\nwhich keeps us safe from near and distant enemies.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not merely whether the white peoples of the world are\r\nto have the right to develop the riches of the backward nations for\r\nthe benefit of the world, but of _how_ they are to do it. So far,\r\neven in forward-looking lands, it has been impossible to eliminate\r\nprivate ownership and colossal private fortunes from the wheel of\r\noil production; in Mexico, to-day, it would be disaster beyond\r\nunderstanding to turn the right of concession and oil privileges over\r\nto corrupt and inept government. The battle of the oil companies in\r\nMexico is to save, first themselves from such a fate, and second to\r\nsave all the unopened oil resources in the world from the strangling\r\nhold of such governments and such peoples everywhere. The oil industry\r\ncan no longer carry the burden of such conditions, for the prices of\r\nyour gasoline and your ship’s fuel oil are reflections not of a world\r\nscarcity, but of the uncertainty, the colossal artificial difficulties\r\nof oil production in the backward lands.\r\n\r\nCommerce has fashioned the world into one brotherhood, and the Great\r\nWar, for all its appearances, has welded us all into a mightier machine\r\nof civilization than history has ever known. Oil is the fuel of that\r\nmachine, and oil must come to its engine, though all the power of\r\npoliticians and bandits combine to keep it in the soil. The backward\r\ncountries are swept into the forefront of commercial importance when\r\noil begins to flow from their soil. The process is going on all over\r\nthe world. In Mexico it is at its zenith. The oil must come, and from\r\nMexico before all others, for Mexico lies in the heart of the world,\r\nher shores touched by more waters in proportion to her area than any\r\nother continental nation. And her stores of oil are the greatest man\r\nhas yet found or dreamed of.\r\n\r\nTo-day the world’s need of oil threatens the life of Mexico. It\r\nis eating out her body by revolutions, by bandit governments, by\r\ncolossal graft which feeds on the ever growing river of gold from\r\nthe oil fields. The world’s need for Mexico’s oil threatens her with\r\nintervention, not because of capitalistic machinations, but because of\r\nthe crass and wicked injustices which the wealth has tempted her to\r\nwreak upon her foreign residents, because wealth has undermined her\r\ngovernment and given her over to demagogues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                           THE GOLDEN GEESE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all these devious ways Mexico has tried to kill the goose which lays\r\nher golden eggs. Not the least onerous of her efforts in this direction\r\nhas been the seeking she has always done to make the United States\r\ngovernment and American business men take the responsibility for this\r\nprecious goose of commerce. And sad to tell--to the Mexican mind at\r\nleast--we have not always awakened quite promptly enough to our sudden\r\nnew responsibilities, and the goose has more than once dropped near to\r\ndying in our arms.\r\n\r\nThat golden goose was the product of the nature of Mexico and of the\r\nrégime of Porfirio Diaz. Long before Mexico became independent, long\r\nbefore the social problems which assail her now had been allowed to\r\ngain impetus, Nature had given up vast riches from the Mexican soil.\r\nSpain garnered them in, and gave Mexico such care as she knew how to\r\ngive, and the golden era of the three centuries of Colonial life rolled\r\nout. Then came the first revolution, and the destruction of such wealth\r\nas Spain had left, until Diaz organized what remained and with it began\r\nhis thirty years of peace.\r\n\r\nIn those thirty years. Mexico was changed from a land whose wealth\r\npoured out in bonanzas returning only caprice for industry and wealth\r\nfor caprice, into one where industry, solidly invested capital,\r\nand wise foresight gained the golden fruit. In other words, the\r\ngoose became domesticated, and produced golden eggs when she was\r\nappropriately fed with golden capital and golden brains.\r\n\r\nIt was literally the wealth imported and created by those years\r\nof peace and domestication which made possible the outbreak of\r\nrevolutionary activity in 1910 and drove Diaz from Mexico in 1911.\r\nProsperity was too much for poor Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe revolution, indeed, came at a moment of Mexico’s saturation\r\nwith prosperity. And it has continued by the continuation of that\r\nprosperity, which has furnished and still furnishes the fuel of\r\nbanditry and revolution. It was not until after Diaz fell that the\r\ngreat wealth of Mexican oil became patent. And not until Carranza began\r\nimposing his taxes on the oil industry do we find the upsurgence of the\r\nideas of socialism, bolshevism and nationalization which have been the\r\nbattlecries of all the governments which have followed him. Oil, as we\r\nhave seen, has furnished the sinews of war, and continues to furnish\r\nthem, despite all that can be done to turn the tide.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the revolutions previous to Diaz the rewards of\r\nsuccess were governorships, sometimes presidencies, and always some\r\nbrief spell of peace. But to-day the reward is too vast, the graft\r\nquite too colossal, to slow down the round of struggle. Wealth pours\r\ninto the national capital in amounts which would be quite hopeless of\r\ncomprehension to the revolutionists of the older day. More tax money\r\nreaches Mexico City to-day from oil alone than Diaz had from every\r\nsource at his command--while, save for the oil fields, Mexico is to-day\r\na desert waste.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder, then, that the nation can and does buy herself honors\r\nand praise in the world outside, that she considers it criminal that\r\nshe cannot buy recognition, cannot force aid and trade and gold to flow\r\nto her. Is she not wealthy and can she not buy pages of advertising and\r\nthe services of hundreds of propagandists of every type known to the\r\ntrade? Gold is here and more gold she expects to bring to her through\r\nother channels than her own genuine advancement. She is back again in\r\nthe days of the bonanza mines, when wealth went to caprice and labor\r\nand industry meant nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd so she is killing the golden goose, just as she killed it long ago\r\nunder the Spaniards, by forcing it to lay and lay and lay, till at the\r\nheight of its productivity it is trembling to its death. Destructive\r\nlegislation, the bitter threat of its confiscation, the continuing\r\ntheft of vast sums in exchange for the privilege of struggling against\r\nthese laws and threats--these are striking down the golden bird. To-day\r\nthat goose is dying, and all Mexico seeks is to bring in, somehow,\r\nanother goose to feed her hungry office-holders. She is willing that\r\nit shall be a relatively tame domestic goose, if only it will lay the\r\ngolden eggs of foreign investment, trade, commerce--she would gladly go\r\nback to the relatively mild, but sure, wealth of the time of Diaz.\r\n\r\nAnd what does she offer to induce that timid, wabbling goose across\r\nthe national fence? I can see behind her promises of privilege nothing\r\nmore substantial than outraged rights, and beside them, the panting,\r\nhalf-dead corpses of two golden geese of bonanza days--the almost dead\r\nmining industry, the sadly ill oil industry. For Mexico has limited\r\nmining by confiscatory taxation and by revolutionary outrages which\r\nleft the mines in such a state that to-day the cost of operation is too\r\ngreat for them to continue under present prices. And she has set about\r\nthe starvation of the oil industry, as we have seen, by limiting it to\r\nthe narrow field of the Tampico-Tuxpam district, when the opportunities\r\nfor oil development throughout the whole of Mexico are probably\r\nunequaled in any similar area in the world!\r\n\r\nIt is with such pictures as these that she would tempt trade and\r\ncommerce and investment to Mexico. No, the “centennial expositions,”\r\nthe trade excursions, the special trips for special friends of the\r\ngovernment, even the official telegrams of thanks to American officials\r\nwho breathe a misplaced idealism with regard to Mexico--none of these,\r\nnor all of them, can quite make a screen before the unhappy corpses of\r\nthe once lively golden geese of Mexican prosperity.\r\n\r\nLet us resume, briefly, the list of the events which have marked the\r\nprocess of the years in the Mexican revolutions which began with the\r\nuprising of Madero--and which have been the means of killing foreign\r\nenterprise and native faith in Mexico’s succeeding governments. The\r\nlist is long, but it cannot be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe revolution in 1917-1918 virtually wiped out religion in Mexico,\r\nprofaned, sacked and burned churches, killed and outraged priests,\r\nviolated nuns and girls in the convents, and drove into exile thousands\r\nof priests. The Constitution of 1917 virtually abolished religion,\r\nand yet the Protestant churches have been allowed to continue their\r\nwork (with the result that many Protestant missionaries of Mexico were\r\nactive Carranza and Obregon propagandists in this country). While most\r\nof the exiled Catholic clergy have now been allowed to return, they\r\nstill work under conditions which make religion a virtual monopoly of\r\nthe state, and practically eliminate religious freedom in Mexico.\r\n\r\nTen years of revolution have all but wiped out education in Mexico:\r\nfirst, by destroying the Catholic schools, which were almost the only\r\neducational system in the country outside the great cities, and,\r\nsecond, by so curtailing the appropriations for public school expenses\r\nas to make educational organization impossible.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary hordes, when Mexico City was taken in 1915 by General\r\n(now President) Obregon, sacked the city almost as thoroughly as\r\nAttila sacked Rome, the public being invited by proclamation to join\r\nin the looting. Beautiful houses were made barracks for the soldiers;\r\nautomobiles and horses, including those of foreign diplomats, were\r\ntaken; stores and homes were broken open and robbed, and trainloads of\r\nrich furniture, including carloads of pianos, were shipped out, much of\r\nthe loot coming to the United States to be sold. While the population,\r\nrich and poor, starved, no food was allowed to enter the city, and\r\ntrainloads of beans and corn, the staples of Mexican food, were shipped\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe revolution virtually suspended the political rights of the Mexican\r\npeople. Under Carranza’s decrees, which to this day form the chief\r\nbasis of government in Mexico, no one may hold office who ever served\r\nunder Diaz or Huerta, or who was not known to be a Carranzista\r\nbefore the Huerta uprising--save by special permission, granted only\r\non personal appeal to the president himself. The revolutionists\r\ncontinuously refused to allow any Mexicans but those of known\r\nsympathies with themselves to participate in elections, so that only a\r\nfraction of the eligible voters have ever taken part in any election.\r\n\r\nThe revolution exiled from Mexico, on one pretext or another, virtually\r\nall the higher type of Mexicans, the men who throughout all Mexican\r\nhistory have been the stable and stabilizing element in the government,\r\nleaving Mexico in the hands of demagogues of the worst type, from\r\nthe highest offices to the lowest. There has been talk of political\r\namnesty, but none has yet been forthcoming, and the few Mexican exiles\r\nwho return do so under personal assurance of their personal safety.\r\n\r\nMexico is to-day taxing her people, both natives and foreign\r\ncorporations, to an extent and with a recklessness unknown even in\r\nwar-ridden Europe. Taxes on imports and exports have been doubled and\r\nsextupled. The stamp tax has been quadrupled and broadened to cover\r\nalmost every possible human activity; direct taxation on every form of\r\nindustry and export taxes on the country’s products have become the\r\nnormal, where, before, these forms of taxation were distinctly avoided\r\nin order to encourage enterprise. Mexico is still spending more on\r\nher army, mostly in graft, than Diaz spent on his whole government,\r\nincluding interest on foreign indebtedness (which the revolution has\r\nnever paid).\r\n\r\nThe present taxation system has been coupled with favoritism and graft\r\nto an extent that punishes with ruin any enterprise (save those fed\r\nfrom the natural resources of the soil, such as oil) which is engaged\r\nin a business where profiteering is not possible.\r\n\r\nCarranza, as we have seen, financed his revolution by issuing\r\n2,000,000,000 pesos of paper money, forced into circulation at the\r\npoints of bayonets. None of this has ever been honestly redeemed.\r\nThe paper money orgy covered three years, and absolutely wiped out\r\nall semblance of credit and all use of paper in business. In its\r\ncourse, the revolution took from the banks in “loans” approximately\r\n$28,000,000, completing the ruin of the banking system, as I have\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\r\nCarranza took over the railways of the republic in 1914, and since that\r\ndate the revolutionary group has operated them for the profit of the\r\ngovernment and themselves. They have increased passenger, freight and\r\nexpress rates to figures many times the normal, forcing the properties\r\nto yield the national treasury $1,500,000 a month, meanwhile paying\r\nnothing of rental to their owners, whose fixed charges are being\r\ndefaulted at the rate of $1,000,000 a month--a total theft of nearly\r\n$400,000,000, growing at the rate of $1,000,000 a month.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionaries gained the support of the sincere Mexican\r\nprogressives and of American students on the ground of a defense of\r\nthe Mexican Constitution of 1857, but after they came to power they\r\npromulgated the Constitution of 1917, a new instrument, although the\r\nold Constitution was amply provided with means for its amendment.\r\nThe new document is the most radical written Constitution in effect\r\nin the world to-day, but its provisions have been used so far only\r\nfor the aggrandizement and enrichment of those who can abuse its\r\nprivileges. The provisions for the confiscation and distribution of all\r\npieces of land of large area have been used only to take properties\r\nof foreigners and Mexicans of the old régime to hand them over to\r\nrevolutionary leaders. The provisions against the operating of mines,\r\netc., by foreign companies have so far been used only to transfer\r\nsuch properties to friendly Mexicans and Germans. The provisions\r\n“nationalizing” oil deposits have been used only to exact towering\r\ntaxes and millions of dollars of loot from the foreign companies and\r\nto drive the properties more and more into the hands of the British,\r\nDutch and Germans, and away from the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe revolution has allowed and abetted the looting and ravaging of\r\nMexico by every method known to brigandage. Hundreds of thousands\r\nof cattle have been killed for their hides; thousands of acres of\r\nstanding crops have been wantonly ruined; seed grains have been stolen\r\nor destroyed; the vast sugar industry, left stagnant by Zapata’s\r\ndepredations has, since the government regained possession, been wiped\r\nout by the shipping away for “junk” of the machinery of the sugar\r\nmills; graft has been levied against relief trains sent by the American\r\nRed Cross to feed starving Mexicans and the contents of such trains\r\neven stolen and sold for personal profit of generals.\r\n\r\nCarranza encouraged and abetted a military oligarchy which supported\r\nbrigandage as a means for its own profit. Campaigns against the\r\nbandits and rebels were not pressed, arms and ammunition were sold by\r\nthe federals to the bandits and rebels, in order that the military\r\nmight continue to have work to do. The officers, acting as their own\r\npaymasters, padded the army rolls to many times their actual size,\r\nand the balance between the expenses and pay of the actual army and\r\nthe phantom army was pocketed by the officers. The Obregon process,\r\na variation of the Carranza plan, paid millions of pesos in cash\r\nand land to ex-bandits and revolutionaries, setting up Villa on a\r\nrich hacienda, and paying out the resources of the nation to buy the\r\nappearance of a peace.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary favorites, as we have seen, were given the rich state of\r\nYucatan for loot. They foisted upon that community (the only spot in\r\nMexico where any wealth has ever been created through manufacturing\r\nand industry as opposed to the sacking of the riches of the soil), a\r\nso-called “socialistic” régime. A “modern state” was set up, and the\r\nexperiment of taking from the rich for the benefit of the poor was\r\nset in full swing. By means of a great national monopoly of the hemp\r\nindustry, prices were so inflated that in the course of five years the\r\nAmerican farmer paid, in artificially-increased prices for twine for\r\nhis wheat-binding machinery, $112,000,000 to the Mexican revolution.\r\nThe state-controlled hemp trust has been forced to relinquish its\r\ncontrol, and the costly experiment seems passed. Here is the first\r\ncollapse of the Mexican fetish of socialistic demagogy, but it seems\r\nsafe to believe that it will not be the last.\r\n\r\nSo stands the record, incomplete, shorn of detail, but each item taken\r\nfrom the history of shame which has been written in Mexico in the years\r\njust passed. Hidden behind a curtain of fair words and lofty idealism,\r\nthe shame has been committed, but behind that same curtain to-day\r\ndisintegration is hurrying on, coming as it came to Yucatan in the\r\ngrist of inevitable retribution. That we may understand the end, it\r\nbehooves us not to close our eyes to the beginnings.\r\n\r\nThe killing of the golden geese of recent years in Mexico carries a\r\nresponsibility from which the United States cannot be entirely free.\r\nThe eight years of the Wilson régime, when American foreign policy,\r\nas enunciated by Secretary of State Bryan, held that Americans who\r\nventured abroad did so at their own risk and had no right to ask the\r\nprotection of their government, was a mighty factor in the despoliation\r\nwhich followed in Mexico. Carranza, seeking the excuse for the policies\r\nto which the great wealth of the oil fields tempted him, found in this,\r\nour official attitude, his opportunity for baiting the Americans and\r\nwith them most other foreigners in Mexico. His virtual espousal of the\r\nGerman cause in the Great War gave him still further opportunities, and\r\nthe result has been written in the outrages which he committed against\r\nthe Americans. This is a list only less appalling than the list of the\r\noutrages which were perpetrated against Mexico and the Mexicans in the\r\nname of the revolution. Here, briefly, is the record. Although many of\r\nits outrages were committed only during the Carranza régime, it must be\r\nremembered that that régime is the direct ancestor of those which have\r\nfollowed it, for the personalities seem the same, the shift in their\r\nplaces being the only change.\r\n\r\nThe revolution has killed over 3,000 foreigners, most of them in cold\r\nblood, probably not one per cent in fair and open battle.\r\n\r\nThe revolution has murdered over 600 Americans since 1910, and the\r\nrevolutionaries have violated scores of American women.\r\n\r\nThe revolution has ruined over $1,000,000,000 worth of American\r\nproperty in Mexico through wanton destruction, cynical recklessness and\r\nsavage bravado.\r\n\r\nThe revolution has driven from their homes in Mexico more than 30,000\r\nAmericans, men, women and children, who, in carrying to Mexico the high\r\nstandards of American living, American business and American ethics,\r\nwere pioneers of our trade and influence, and potential civilizers of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThe revolution has, as we know full well, promulgated that Constitution\r\nof 1917 which has been the bane of American, even more than it has of\r\nMexican, business.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican revolution, by its baiting of the American government\r\nthrough nearly a decade, has nurtured in Mexico and sought to spread\r\nthroughout Latin-America a hatred and fear of Americans and hostility\r\nto the Monroe Doctrine. This is threatening not only our own prestige\r\non this continent, but the peace of the established governments of our\r\nLatin-American sisters, through the fomenting of hostility and unrest\r\nwithin their frontiers.\r\n\r\nMore than all, the revolution has made of Mexico a refuge for the\r\nenemies of the United States, first by allowing to be set up in its\r\ncapital the central organization of the German spy and sabotage system\r\nin the Western world, and since the war by welcoming and aiding the\r\nbolshevists and radicals who are working openly for the overthrow of\r\nAmerican institutions in this country and the destruction of American\r\nindustry and trade in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis is a bitter record, but without it, as I have had to say of many\r\nthings in this book, the picture cannot come clear to our eyes. We\r\ncannot, in justice to our own understanding, forget that since the\r\ndeath of Madero, and even before, the Mexican revolution has been\r\nbut one movement. The rulers who have succeeded each other have all\r\nbeen of the same group, and those in power in 1921 are those who\r\nwere scrambling for place within the same ruling group in 1913. “The\r\nrevolution,” as one of them has said, “is the revolution.” And so it\r\nis in more senses than one. We but deceive ourselves if in our very\r\ngenuine desire to give each new Mexican president a chance, we close\r\nour eyes to the obvious facts of his political heritage and the human\r\ntools he must use.\r\n\r\nOnly one word more, and the tale of the golden geese is done. The\r\nprotection which the American government has failed to give its traders\r\nand investors who have gone abroad has had an effect which those\r\ntraders and investors must obviate before they step forth, at least\r\ninto Mexico, again. Through the years of the Great War, our government,\r\nalong with those of the Allies, put into effect in neutral countries,\r\na “Black List” which was designed to keep German, Austrian and Turkish\r\nfirms and their sympathizers from dealing and trading with the neutrals\r\nor with the peoples of the allied countries.\r\n\r\nMexico was of course our chief field for activity, and there our Black\r\nList had its severest test. In those months of struggle, we committed\r\nmany faults; we shut off friendly firms from trade with this country;\r\nwe encouraged, by many stupidities, the activities of smugglers and\r\n“cloaks” who bought for the Germans in Texas jobbing towns; we created\r\nfor ourselves a phalanx of enemies of American trade who will not soon\r\nforget. Worse than this, even, when the war was over the tremendous\r\nmachinery of the enforcement of the provisions of the Enemy Trading\r\nAct, with its literally priceless information regarding the business\r\nof Mexico, the capital and trade of the Germans, the Mexicans, and the\r\nAmericans in the whole country--all this was thrown away. Literally it\r\nwas cast into the waste-basket, and the information which if followed\r\nup and kept even partially up to date would to-day be the richest mine\r\nof information for American importers and exporters was scrapped like\r\nworn-out machinery. I do not know how many millions of dollars were\r\nspent in gathering this data for the War Trade Board, but I do know the\r\nnature of that data. It is gone, and the advantage which might have\r\ncome from it is lost forever.\r\n\r\nBut the unfriendliness which was engendered by our mistakes, which was\r\nonly slowly being wiped out by the correction of those mistakes when\r\npeace came--that unfriendliness remains. That is our only heritage of\r\nour Mexican activity in the war; it couples up with our own mistakes of\r\nignorance or of carelessness during the same period.\r\n\r\nFrom 1915 to 1919, literally all the foreign trade of Mexico passed\r\nthrough the United States. Imports and exports, the goods from and for\r\nEngland and Japan and China and Africa no less than our own domestic\r\ntrade with Mexico went through the border ports by rail. Of necessity,\r\nthe advantages of ship traffic were lost, and our manufacturers and\r\nour buyers of Mexico’s raw materials had the greatest opportunity of\r\nall time to capture the vast bulk of the Mexican trade. The tremendous\r\napparent increases in our Mexican trade during the war years were only\r\nthe record of the world’s commerce passing through our border towns.\r\nBut to-day we have retained only a little of the gains recorded then,\r\nand we shall lose still more of what we have kept. And why? Because we\r\nhave never truly sought Mexican trade and do not seek it to-day.\r\n\r\nAh, yes. We want to trade with Mexico, but, I repeat, we have never\r\nsought Mexican trade. We have wanted to sell Mexico our surplus,\r\nto have her take our extra runs and use the goods we have made in\r\nquantities for other countries. But we have never sought to meet the\r\nexigencies of the Mexican market. We have never done (as a nation, I\r\nmean, of course) what England and Germany have done; we do not follow\r\nspecifications literally and send cloth, for instance, with exactly\r\nthe number of threads per inch which the Mexican must have to get his\r\nbest customs classification. We do not rearrange our patterns to meet\r\na special demand of the Mexican market, carefully described to us by\r\nour customers. It is the old story of American trade everywhere in\r\nthe world--our manufacturers have heard it in a dozen ways, and they\r\nare justly tired of the sound of it. My only point is that during the\r\nperiod of the war, when Mexican trade had of necessity to come to us\r\nin great volume, we did not link the Mexican buyer to us, either by\r\nmeeting his demands or by helping him to understand our difficulties.\r\n\r\nSo it was that when the golden goose of Mexican business was\r\nsurreptitiously put into our arms when we were busy with a lively war\r\nin Europe, we did not take the care of it that its parents might have\r\nexpected of us.\r\n\r\nThe result is that to-day we have little hold on the trade of Mexico,\r\ndespite the astonishing figures of our preponderance in it. For what we\r\nship to Mexico is largely food and what we take from Mexico is largely\r\noil--an exchange which is more significant than columns of figures in\r\nshowing the economic condition of the land we trade with. Again we\r\nswing back to the one great, significant fact, the need of an activity\r\nwhich transcends mere barter, which has little to do with whether we\r\nare deceived by Mexican conditions or whether we are willing to risk\r\nthem now for the sake of the great possible gains of the future. This\r\nis the issue of our duty to learn how we can serve in the solution of\r\nthe problem--and to devote something of our energy to that solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                        THE HIGHWAY TO SOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution of the problems of Mexico’s commerce and business seems to\r\nrest in hands alien to Mexico. The destructions of the past ten years\r\nare bringing her steadily nearer to annihilation, and Mexico herself\r\nseems helpless to save herself. These make the appearance, and it is\r\nvivid indeed. But it may still be only an appearance, if the forces\r\nwhich are acting and must act can be brought to see that they can and\r\nmust work in Mexico herself.\r\n\r\nThe cycle of destructions insists upon showing itself as the round from\r\nthe materialism of Diaz on to the destructions of an era of profaned\r\nutopian idealism and now to an era of materialism again. But this\r\ntime it is an era of materialism which differs from the Diaz time,\r\nand is more potent, at the moment, for good and for ill. For to-day,\r\nin the high places of government, controlling through their greed the\r\nvery minions of government, is an animating power which is not the\r\nidealism nor the self-sacrifice of devoted rulers, but the worship of\r\nwealth alone. That power is mighty for destruction, but at the very\r\nmoment that it functions thus, another form of wealth, “capitalism”\r\nif you will, is working slowly for the saving of such of Mexico as is\r\nbeing saved. For “capitalism,” in foreign guise, in such enterprises\r\nas even the mad radicals of the day point to as the signs of their\r\n“progress”--here capitalism is giving Mexico her only surcease from the\r\ndestructions of her rulers.\r\n\r\nWealth is the one power which men recognize in Mexico. It is to-day\r\nabove government, for it dominates government and destroys government\r\nby the very temptation which it holds out to successful revolution. It\r\nrules to-day in Yucatan, even as it ruins the individuals of Yucatan.\r\nYet, too, it rules in the oil fields, for it makes the vast production\r\nof oil possible, because it alone has the power and the foresight to\r\ndevelop oil’s potentialities. And there, in the oil fields, it is being\r\nturned, ever so slightly, to the beginnings of its ultimate destiny,\r\nwhich must be, I believe, the saving of Mexico.\r\n\r\nStrange tales I have told of the oil fields, and yet it is a far\r\nstranger tale which I have now to tell. For I would point out the vast\r\nopportunity which awaits that wealth of oil for the saving of Mexico.\r\nIn the light of that possibility, the mighty stream of oil which in a\r\nthousand ships pours from Mexico into the industries of the globe, is a\r\nhelpless Niagara, childishly unconscious of its own power.\r\n\r\nThe constitutions and laws and decrees of the Mexican revolutionaries\r\nstill hold the wealth of oil in their grip. There has been, in the\r\nsummer months of 1921, a mild effort to break that grip, to stay the\r\nhand of strangulation which is at the throat of the oil industry, but\r\nthis is still self-defense. There is a yet more persistent force than\r\nmere taxation or even than mere confiscation at work in the oil fields\r\nof Mexico. This force savors of elements mightier than mere industry;\r\nit seems to be taking the form of a sinister elaboration of the vital\r\nprinciples of bolshevism--the bolshevism which rules in Russia and is a\r\nbattle cry in Mexico.\r\n\r\nAmong these principles of bolshevism, enunciated by Lenin himself a\r\nyear ago, was the setting of the capitalistic powers at each other’s\r\nthroats, such powers as Japan and America, that they might destroy one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico we see that threat from Russia developed with the\r\nthoroughness of a too-eager pupil. In Yucatan the cycle has brought\r\ntwo vast financial interests to battle--the millions of the Equitable\r\nand the Royal Bank of Canada, against the International Harvester with\r\nother unlimited resources. In mightier and more daring terms, and even\r\nmore deliberately, in Tampico and in the false issues of concessions,\r\nMexico and the governments, radical, bolshevist indeed, of the\r\nrevolutionary era, have been setting not merely groups of financiers\r\nbut the interests of nations at each other’s throats. The issues of\r\nconcessions on the one side and open oil fields on the other seem to\r\nhave been planned and fomented and distributed with a deliberation\r\nwhich is not Mexican to bring the United States and England to\r\ngrips--in Mexico. So the spoken threat of Lenin finds elaborate action\r\nin distant Mexico.\r\n\r\nOil has been the victim, the tool, then, of those who would destroy\r\nour civilization? We do not know. But this we do know--that to save\r\nitself, to save great nations from war, to save the world’s oil for\r\nthe uses of civilization, oil must come to its own rescue. It may be\r\nsaved temporarily in other ways than by itself, but itself it must\r\nsave sooner or later. If sooner, the power will be for good; if later,\r\nit will be for destruction, even as the powers in Yucatan are being\r\nexpended for destruction. The comparison is inadequate, perhaps unfair,\r\nbut the vision is crystal clear. It shows the last great power of the\r\nworld--wealth--diverted from its proper channels to battle within\r\nitself. The dragon’s teeth of capitalism have raised up armies and the\r\nstone cast by bolshevism has thrown them at each other’s throats.\r\n\r\nAnd this cannot be, and must not be. Our civilization rocks. Were it\r\nto pass on to the millennium, the rocking would be worth the price.\r\nBut we see, not the millennium, but, as in Yucatan, the coming of new\r\ndestructions, with capital, and labor, in rôles of ignominy.\r\n\r\nFor to-day oil, and the capitalism it represents, as yet does little\r\ngood for Mexico. It pours its wealth--nearly $50,000,000 a year--into\r\nthe coffers of government and there, like the golden apple, it creates\r\ndiscord and wars and bloodshed. It feeds and fattens the group in power\r\nand makes it worth the while for other groups as fast as their petty\r\nagitations will allow, to rise up and overthrow their predecessors,\r\nto the end of getting their share of the loot, and a new distribution\r\nof favors. The gold which pours into the national treasury inspires,\r\nas we have seen, all manner of radical legislation and constitutional\r\nprovisions and oppressions to make the capitalism which develops the\r\noil disgorge more and more of oil’s wealth, and bow more deeply beneath\r\nthe yoke of political personalism.\r\n\r\nThus is the gold which flows from the oil wells dynamically active--as\r\na poison and a weapon against those who create it. The oil companies of\r\nthemselves take no part in Mexican politics. This, I admit, is almost\r\nunbelievable, but I am convinced that except where government--our\r\ngovernment or that of England--has directed them, the oil companies\r\nhave not used their power politically. The United States and England\r\nhave both taken hands in Mexican politics, and particularly was\r\nWashington active in arbitrating the destinies of Mexico in the eight\r\nyears just closed. But that does not concern us just now. The liquid\r\ngold from the oil fields has never used its power alone.\r\n\r\nIt has not yet used its power for its great possible good, either.\r\nNot even for so much good as the International Harvester and the Eric\r\ncorporation have used theirs in Yucatan to the discomfiture of Alvarado\r\nand the chastening of the henequen industry. Never, for the sake of a\r\nprinciple alone, has an oily hand been lifted to say “thus far and no\r\nfarther.” Never has an oil official done more than cry aloud over the\r\npressure of the thumb-screws--cries which do no more than extract more\r\nwealth to fatten the generals who, with added strength, only gave the\r\nscrew another turn.\r\n\r\nFor seven years the oil companies paid the rebel general, Manuel\r\nPelaez, a comfortable tribute. In that time they also paid Carranza all\r\nhe asked in “taxes.” They were helpless, and the war was the excuse,\r\nnot for strength on their part, but for submission to unwarranted\r\nand unjust oppression, oppression which had no object save personal\r\naggrandizement and enrichment.\r\n\r\nHere is the one power in Mexico which is potent, accepting the rule of\r\ncorrupt government, passing on its power of gold to those who use it\r\nfor nothing but their own ends, and for the destruction of all that\r\nour civilization holds dear.\r\n\r\nThey buy privilege in Mexico, the privilege to do the business which\r\nthey must do, while the sinister powers to whom they pay tribute cut\r\nthem from the development of new fields upon which their ultimate\r\nfuture and Mexico’s immediate future depend. The whole power of Mexican\r\nrevolution and of the groups which control the revolution lies in that\r\none principle which I have reiterated: they give no rights, they sell\r\nno rights; only privilege is on the auction-block. Those who buy it\r\nto-day and those who contemplate the buying of it as a way to enter\r\na promising foreign trade and investment field are the upholders of\r\nthe shameful exploitation under which Mexico herself bows. And of\r\nthese, the greater sinner, to my mind, is he who plans to enter Mexico\r\nnow. After all, we must in fairness admit that the old companies have\r\nthe potent excuse of their vast holdings and of their duty to their\r\nstockholders.\r\n\r\nThe plan which I hold as the solution of the economic and political\r\nchaos of Mexico would comprise a shifting of the center of control\r\nfrom politics to economics, where the motive force, at least, has\r\never rested. I would no longer tolerate the application of political\r\nremedies for economic ills, but would go so far as to suggest an\r\neconomic remedy for both economic and political afflictions.\r\nApparently this is what our government plans, and what Mexico’s\r\ngovernment will not bring herself to accept.\r\n\r\nYears of observation of the Mexican problem has led to the conviction\r\nthat the international difficulties of Mexico are between the Mexican\r\npoliticians and the American government--their interests decidedly\r\nconflict. But there is no division of interest between Mexican business\r\nmen and American business men; the former are just as disturbed over\r\nthe confiscatory policies of the Constitution of 1917 as are the\r\nlatter. So recently as April 7, 1921, a petition was sent to President\r\nObregon by a group of landowners in the Mexican state of Jalisco,\r\nprotesting against the enforcement of the rulings of the “National\r\nAgrarian Commission” which confiscated their properties in the name of\r\nthe “social revolution” under the same Article 27 which attacks foreign\r\nproperty rights. Its words are worth recording as an indication that it\r\nis not alone the American business man who feels the pinch of the rule\r\nof privilege in Mexico.\r\n\r\n “Such commissions,” the petition reads, “are nothing more than\r\n partisan centers where laws, reason and justice are mocked.\r\n\r\n “This atrocious work will be judged by public opinion as soon as the\r\n deep and serious damage which has been done is known, and history will\r\n in time establish the responsibility. Suffice it to say that in every\r\n case it has been a work of destruction and never of construction....\r\n\r\n “The local agrarian commission is inventing fantastic plans of\r\n taxation, confiscating large and small properties, and sugar, _mezcal_\r\n and orange plantations, which have cost their legitimate owners years\r\n of toil and the investment of considerable capital. The federal\r\n tribunals, deaf to all appeals, follow an invariable line of conduct\r\n in every case against the landowners. Should the landowner invoke\r\n in his behalf the same doctrines which have been applied to the\r\n benefit of others, he finds out that these same doctrines are never\r\n interpreted in his favor. The authorities only favor those they wish\r\n to favor and to accomplish this end they do not hesitate to override\r\n justice and reason.”\r\n\r\nIt is to this Mexican business man, still a stable factor in Mexico,\r\nthat we must look for the change in government attitude toward business\r\nwhich is indispensable to the solution of the social, economic and\r\npolitical chaos of Mexico to-day. In numbers these Mexican business\r\nmen are few; in grasp of world affairs they lag behind men in similar\r\npositions in this country. Nevertheless, their interests, those of the\r\nAmerican companies now operating in Mexico and those of the Americans\r\nand other foreigners who hope to share in Mexican trade, are and will\r\nbe one. It is in the way of supporting such Mexicans in their efforts\r\nto influence the government of their own country that I speak of an\r\neconomic remedy for all the afflictions of Mexico. I would, if I\r\ncould, put them in control, would bring back to their aid the brains\r\nand the energy of the exiles who belong, in one way or another, to\r\ntheir class of producers.\r\n\r\nIt is to such an end that the foreign business man who hopes, in the\r\nimmediate or in the distant future, to share in Mexican trade should\r\nturn his hand. He should demand, in the councils of his government, in\r\nthe congress of the country, in the powerful conventions of chambers of\r\ncommerce, that Washington insist definitely on a return to civilized\r\nand economic rule in Mexico. This Washington seems to seek but they\r\nand they alone have the power to compel the decision by the powers of\r\nthis world that the day of privilege in Mexico must be put aside, and\r\nthe era of equal rights shall dawn. In the hands of American business\r\ninterests the tool of pressure is very powerful. This is a moment, not\r\nto rush in to get easy markets on the “ground floor,” but to demand\r\nconditions which will give the opportunities and the profits to those\r\nwho can best use them--the truly Golden Rule of business the world\r\naround.\r\n\r\nWhen that day comes, all will profit. Until that day comes, none can\r\nhave aught but risk and chance, the chance of the gambler. For who\r\ncan say how the wheel of politics will turn? And only he who knows\r\nMexico and the Mexicans of old can assume that he can buy his way\r\nto privilege with the next pirate crew. The solution is in the hands\r\nof American business men because it is in the hands of the Mexican\r\nbusiness men whom they can support and aid. And in the group of such\r\nMexican business men we must include not only the true Mexicans, but\r\nthe foreign companies which have worked long in Mexico and so have made\r\nthemselves a true part of Mexico, vitally concerned in her progress and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nThose foreign companies of Mexico are the business world of Mexico. And\r\nthey know Mexico and her needs better, in many ways, than Mexico knows\r\nherself. They know, as every one who is honest with himself knows, that\r\nthe hope of Mexico is in truly devoted, native government. Yet we still\r\nsee them pass the power which could to-morrow restore Mexico to the\r\nfamily of nations over to those who use it for their own ends and for\r\nthe utter destruction of all Mexico that is outside the influence of\r\nthe oil fields and of their civilization.\r\n\r\nThe great companies are Mexican, in essence. They have rights as\r\nAmericans and as Englishmen, to be sure, but their greater right is in\r\nMexico. And they have the right to use their power as they will. They\r\nseek to be good and to be honest and just, but the ends of justice\r\nare defeated by their very honesty. I do not advocate activity in\r\npolitics, nor even the tangible aid of oil companies to revolutionists\r\nof any stamp. I hold only that if the oil companies would give over\r\ntheir profits (as they did temporarily in the summer of 1921) long\r\nenough to shut off the stream of gold from corrupt government, if they\r\nwould thus render revolution and loot unprofitable, the solution of\r\nthe problem of Mexico would soon come, in a return to an age of honest\r\nwork and honest government, free from the temptation of vast unearned\r\nwealth. We need not ask how or by whom the change shall be made,\r\nwhether by a sincere Mexican government ready to cast out its evil\r\nelements, or by a government yet to be born. That is not our concern,\r\nfor our concern is to search for our part and having found that part,\r\nto play it well.\r\n\r\nIs not this a solution of the Mexican problem? Should we not say to the\r\nforeign companies:\r\n\r\n“You are in Mexico, you are of Mexico. You represent all that is\r\nstable in Mexico. You know those Mexicans who can solve the country’s\r\nproblems, and make Mexico again a land where white men can keep the\r\naltar fires burning bright, where honest Mexicans, and foreigners if\r\nthey will, may help to make it all that it should and must be.”\r\n\r\nRevolutionary radicalism has run its course in Mexico, and we are back\r\nagain at a rule of capitalism, a rule which capitalism, for right or\r\nwrong, cannot longer avoid. The eyes of the world are on the moneyed\r\npowers of the world. It is childish to try to deceive radicals or\r\nconservatives with saying anything else. To-day, in Yucatan, capitalism\r\n(because circumstances have forced it to do so) is exacting the toll of\r\npenalty from the henequen industry and its native spokesmen. To-day in\r\nTampico, capitalism hesitates to move on, and waits for the ruin which\r\nwill tumble about it, forcing it, in its turn, to grind Mexico beneath\r\nits heel. Somehow, dimly, seems to emerge the lesson which Mexico has\r\nfor us and for the world. Capitalism must in the end save the world\r\nfrom the ruin of revolution. To-day in Mexico it can move quickly and\r\nfreely. To-morrow it may be clutched in the very destruction which is\r\nupon it, and be forced, itself, to the destruction not alone of the\r\nenemies of our civilization, but of the fabric of progress of that\r\ncivilization. The story of Yucatan is written. Is the story of Tampico\r\nand all Mexico to follow the same plot, and is the world to go blindly\r\non, believing that in compromise it shall gain strength?\r\n\r\nTruly the crimson feast is preparing for the vultures, and vultures\r\nwill our eagles of business become if they wait longer on their distant\r\nheights for revolution to finish its bloody orgy. To-day there is\r\nyet time. In Mexico there is yet time. Why wait for the chaos, from\r\nwhich there seems but one emergence, the emergence to intervention\r\nand blood and long foreign rule? The one stable force, the wealth\r\nof Mexico, must choose a nobler course than that waiting, than that\r\ncynical hoping. It can choose and it must choose. Old worlds are indeed\r\npassed away and the paths of new stars are to-day being plotted. In\r\nthe courses of those new stars power will be used without apology,\r\nas the revolutionary radicalism which our old civilization created\r\nmoves without apology. Our duty is to the future, not to the dead past\r\nof compromise and convention and self-righteousness. Is capitalism\r\nhonest and sincere and bound up with the welfare of the human race? Or\r\nis it indeed the vulture which waits to feast only upon dead bodies\r\namid ruins? To-day in Mexico it waits vulture-like. Its sincerity and\r\nits true righteousness are to be determined not by slavish waiting\r\nfor the ruin which will force it to use its power, as it is using it\r\nin Yucatan, but by its moving, to-day, to the solving of the great\r\nproblems of a great nation as it alone can solve them. Capitalism and\r\nnot revolution, the corporations and people of Mexico, and not foreign\r\npressure, must in the end give answer before the last Tribunal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\nPage 18: “southermost point” changed to “southernmost point”\r\n\r\nPage 114: “outrage perpetated” changed to “outrage perpetuated”\r\n\r\nPage 142: “or for propety” changed to “or for property”\r\n\r\nPage 200: “Sante Fe Railroad” changed to “Santa Fe Railroad”\r\n\r\nPage 236: “pyschology of depravity” changed to “psychology of depravity”",
