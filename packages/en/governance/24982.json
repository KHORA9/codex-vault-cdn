III.-JANUARY, 1863.--No. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUGUENOTS OF NEW ROCHELLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of record that Westchester County, New York, was settled by\r\nemigrants from New England and France, and both seeking homes from\r\nreligious persecutions. As early as 1642, John Throcmorton, with\r\nthirty-five associates, made the first settlement in this section, with\r\nthe approbation of the Dutch authorities. With Roger Williams, driven\r\naway from New England by the violence of Hugh Peters, they came here,\r\nand called the region _Viedeland or Land of Peace_--a beautiful name for\r\nthe region of those seeking rest of conscience from wicked and violent\r\nmen. But even here the Puritan did not find the desired quiet and\r\nsafety; for several of his band perished in the Indian massacre that\r\nsorely visited New Netherland on the 6th of October, 1643.\r\n\r\nThe next settlement of Westchester was commenced in the year 1654, also\r\nby some Puritans from Connecticut, who adopted its present name, and the\r\nRev. Ezekiel Fogge was their first 'independent minister;' and in 1684 a\r\nMr. Warham Mather was called 'for one whole year, and that he shall have\r\nsixty pounds, in country produce, at money price, for his salary, and\r\nthat he shall be paid every quarter.' Governor Fletcher, however,\r\ndeclined inducting the Presbyterian into that living, 'as it was\r\naltogether impossible,' he said, 'it being wholly repugnant to the laws\r\nof England to compel the subject to pay for the maintenance of any\r\nminister who was not of the national Church.' The Episcopal Governor,\r\nhowever, proposes 'a medium in that matter.' Some French emigrants had\r\nalready found their way to this region, and M. Boudet, a French\r\nProtestant minister of Boston, who was in orders from the Bishop of\r\nLondon, could preach in French and English, and the people called him to\r\nthe living, the parish being large enough for two clergymen. M. Boudet\r\nwas accordingly sent for, hoping, as the English Governor writes, 'to\r\nbring the congregation over to the Church;' but, 'when he came, they\r\nrefused to call him.' The Yankee Puritans were evidently not to be\r\noutmanaged by the English churchman. Westchester then numbered 'two or\r\nthree hundred English and Dissenters; a few Dutch.'\r\n\r\nOn the 20th September, 1689, Jacob Leisler, of New York, purchased of\r\nMr. Pell 6,000 acres of land in Westchester, a portion of the manor of\r\nPelham, obtained from the Indians in 1640-'49. The grantor, heirs, and\r\nassigns, as an acknowledgment, were to pay Mr. Pell 'one fatted calf on\r\nevery fourth and twentieth day of June, yearly, and every year, forever,\r\nif demanded.' It is a well known fact that every Huguenot, on the\r\nfestival of St. John, pays his proportion toward the purchase of the fat\r\ncalf whenever claimed.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1690, Leisler leased to the banished Huguenots these\r\nlands, purchased for them, as they came directly here from England, and\r\nwere a portion of the 50,000 who found safety in that glorious\r\nProtestant kingdom four years before the revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes. At the revocation itself, not less than half a million escaped\r\nfrom bigoted France to Holland, Germany, and England; and to those in\r\nthe latter country, Charles II., then on the British throne, granted\r\nletters of denization under the great seal, and Parliament relieved them\r\nfrom 'importation duties and passport fees.' During this same year,\r\nmany, flying from France, were aided in their escape by English vessels\r\noff the island of Rhe, opposite brave _La Rochelle_. According to\r\ntradition, some of these were transported to this region, naming their\r\nnew settlement in honor of their\r\n\r\n   'Own Rochelle, the fair Rochelle,\r\n     Proud city of the waters.'\r\n\r\nIn the Documentary History of New York, vol. iii., p. 926, we find a\r\npetition to Colonel Fletcher, Governor of the colony, signed by Thanet,\r\nand Elei Cothouneau, in behalf of above twenty of these French refugees.\r\n'Your petitioners,' they state, 'having been forced, by the late\r\npersecutions in France, to forsake their country and estates, and flye\r\nto ye Protestant princes * * *, wherefore they were invited to come and\r\nbuy lands in this province, and they might by their labour help the\r\nnecessityes of their families, and did spend all their small store with\r\nthe aid of their friends, whereof they did borrow great sums of money\r\n[MS. torn]. They had lost their country and their estates, but saved\r\ntheir good principles and a pure faith; and, in a strange land,\r\npetitioned his Excellency 'to take their case in serious consideration,\r\nand out of charity and pity to grant them for some years what help and\r\nprivileges your Excellency shall think convenient.' This is one of the\r\nearliest authentic records (1681) we have met with concerning the New\r\nRochelle French refugees.\r\n\r\nPell, the lord of the manor, besides the 6,000 acres already obtained,\r\nalso granted 100 additional, 'for the sake of the French church, erected\r\nor about to be erected, by the inhabitants of the said tract of land.'\r\nThis Huguenot church in New Rochelle was built about 1692-'93, of wood,\r\nand stood in the rear of the present mansion house. It was destroyed\r\nsoon after the Revolutionary war. Louis Bougeaud, about the same time,\r\ndonated a piece of land forty paces square, for a churchyard to bury\r\ntheir dead; and, subsequently, a house with three acres of land was\r\ngiven by the town to the Huguenot church forever.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. DAVID BOUREPOS was the first minister of the New Rochelle\r\nHuguenots; he had likewise served his French brethren on Staten Island.\r\nThe Governor requesting him to nominate 'some persons for the vacant\r\noffices of justices of the peace,' he replies that 'he could not comply,\r\nas none of his colonists at New Rochelle had a knowledge of the English\r\ntongue.' Nothing now is known of Bourepos' ministry or history. From his\r\ntitle of D.D., he must have been a man of learning; and we can learn\r\nsomething about the time when he died from the date of his will.\r\n'Letters of administration were granted to Martha Bourepos, wife of\r\nDavid Bourepos, 25th of October, 1711' (New York Surrogates' Office). He\r\nprobably resigned his pastoral charge in 1694.\r\n\r\nRev. DANIEL BOUDET, A. M., was the next minister of the French\r\nProtestant church at New Rochelle, a native of France; and he\r\naccompanied the French refugees, who reached Boston in the summer of\r\n1686. About the year 1695, M. Boudet came to New Rochelle, and at first\r\nused the French prayers, according to the Protestant churches of France,\r\nand subsequently, every third Sunday, the Liturgy of the English Church.\r\nIn 1709 the French church at New Rochelle determined to follow the\r\nexample of some of their Reformed brethren in England, and conform to\r\nthe English Church. All the members except _two_ agreed to adopt the\r\nLiturgy and Rites of the Church of England, as established by law. Some\r\nthirty names appear on the document, requesting this important\r\necclesiastical change; and for the information especially of the\r\ngenealogical reader, we note some of them: Michael Houdin, Jacob\r\nBleecker, David Lispenard, Isaac Guion, Peter Bertain, John Soulice,\r\nPaul Lecord, Jean Abby, Jos. Antuny, Peter Bonnet, Peter Parquot, Benj.\r\nSeacord, Judith Leconet, Allida Guion, Josiah Le Conte, Elizabeth\r\nLispenard, Moses de St. Croix, Deborah Foulon, Marie Neufville, Mary\r\nStouppe, Jean Nicolle, John Bryan, Oliver Besley, Frederick King,\r\nSusanna Landrin, Anne Danielson, Rutger Bleecker, Mary Rodman, Agnes\r\nDonaldson, Esther Angeoine, Thomas Steel, Jane Contine, Jane Maraux,\r\nJames Pine. 'The petitioners are members of the French Church at New\r\nRochelle' (1793), and 'principally descendants from French Protestants,\r\nwho fled from the religious persecutions in France, in the year one\r\nthousand six hundred and eighty-one.' Their fathers settled at New\r\nRochelle, 1689, nearly a century before the date of this document. Few\r\nlists of family names are more imposing than this; and to this day,\r\ntheir descendants in Westchester County, increased to thousands, rank\r\nwith our most useful and respectable citizens in wealth, good works, and\r\npiety. We are no great sticklers for genealogical _trees_ or _Doomsday\r\nBooks_, yet we believe in pride of family to a proper extent. There was\r\na time once, in this republican land of ours, when many gloried in\r\nignoring the fact that they came from distinguished stocks, as the\r\nspirit of our democratic institutions opposed the notion of family\r\nhistories. We were all born of an honest, industrious race, for several\r\ngenerations back, and that is enough; and so it may be. Still, a man,\r\nwhen asked if he had a grandfather, would logically infer he had one,\r\nbut he could not historically, unless there was some record of the fact.\r\nThis indifference is happily passing way, and an interest of late is\r\nmanifesting itself in such researches. No American, in whose veins runs\r\nHuguenot blood, need be ashamed of his origin. His ancestral history is\r\nmost honorable, brave, and proud.\r\n\r\nIn 1705, Colonel Heathcote thus speaks of M. Boudet, the Huguenot\r\npreacher at New Rochelle: 'A good man, and preaches very intelligibly in\r\nEnglish, which he does every third Sunday in his French congregation,\r\nwhen he uses the Liturgy of the Church. He has done a great deal of\r\nservice since his first coming into this country. * * * He has thirty\r\npounds a year settled on him out of the public revenue here, as the\r\nFrench minister in York hath; but that is paid with so much uncertainty\r\nthat he starves, for the use of it.' During the year 1710, Governor\r\nHunter permitted his congregation to build a new church of England, as\r\nby law established, and the 'Venerable Propagation Society' presented\r\nthe new church with 'one hundred French prayer books of the small sort,\r\nand twenty of a larger impression; and in consideration of the great\r\nlearning and piety of Monsieur Boudet, and his long and faithful\r\ndischarge of his office, they augmented his salary from L30 to L50 per\r\nannum.' At this period we find the following excellent record of this\r\nexcellent French minister: 'M. Boudet is a good old man, near sixty\r\nyears of age, sober, just, and religious.' One hundred more French\r\nprayer books were sent to his church, 'for the edification of the French\r\nyouth who have learned so much of that language as to join with him\r\ntherein.' During the year 1714, M. Boudet took the spiritual charge of\r\nthe Mohegan or River Indians, at which period he is called 'minister of\r\nthe French colonistic congregation at New Rochelle.' In 1714 he reports\r\nfifty communicants in his church, and asks for an English Bible, with a\r\nsmall quantity of English Common Prayers, because 'our young people, or\r\nsome of them, have sufficiently learned to read English for to join in\r\nthe public service, when read in English.'\r\n\r\nM. Boudet died in September, 1722, aged sixty-nine years, nearly\r\ntwenty-seven of which he had been the minister of the New Rochelle\r\nchurch. He was eminently useful in keeping his congregation together\r\namidst its adverse circumstances, and was greatly beloved. He was\r\ninterred beneath the chancel floor of the old church; and for whose use\r\nhe bequeathed his library.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. PIERRE STOUPPE, A. M., succeeded M. Boudet. He was also a\r\nnative of France, and said to be a son or nearly related to the Rev. M.\r\nStouppe, pastor of the French Protestant church in London, who was sent\r\nto Geneva, in 1654, by Oliver Cromwell, to negotiate there in the\r\naffairs of the French Protestants. He was born 1690, studied divinity at\r\nGeneva, and accepted a call to the Huguenot church at Charleston, S. C.\r\nHere he continued to preach until 1723, when, resigning the charge, he\r\nconformed to the Church of England, crossing the Atlantic for\r\nordination. He was admitted to holy orders in 1723, and licensed to\r\nofficiate as a missionary in the colony of New York, and to the French\r\nProtestants of New Rochelle, with a salary of L50 per annum. To this\r\nlatter flock he proved very acceptable, from his ability to preach in\r\nFrench, the only language which most of them understood. His elders, or\r\n_anciens_, as sometimes called, were then Isaac Quantein and Isaac\r\nGuion. The new Huguenot pastor soon found trouble, as his predecessor\r\nhad, with the dissatisfied M. Moulinais and his followers. Still he was\r\nuseful: in 1726 he writes that he 'baptized six grown negroes and seven\r\nnegro children, fitted eight young people for the sacrament of the\r\nLord's Supper, to which they have been accordingly admitted,' and 'the\r\nnumber of communicants at Easter was thirty-three.'\r\n\r\nIn a letter of December 11, 1727, he presents some important information\r\nconcerning the early settlement of New Rochelle: 'The present number of\r\ninhabitants amounts to very near four hundred persons. There is a dozen\r\nof houses near the church, standing pretty close to one another, which\r\nmakes the place a sort of a town; the remainder of the houses and\r\nsettlements are dispersed up and down, as far as the above 6,000 acres\r\nof land could bear. Nay, besides these, there were several other French\r\nfamilies, members of New Rochelle, settled without its bounds.' Such was\r\nthe commencement of the present picturesque and beautiful village of New\r\nRochelle. More than a century and a half has passed away since its\r\nfounders, the French refugees, emigrated to the spot; but their noble\r\nand holy principles have left good, undying influences, now seen in the\r\nrefinement, morals, and religion of their descendants, in this entire\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nM. Stouppe further states that there were in the settlement two Quaker\r\nfamilies, three Dutch ones, four Lutherans. 'The first never assist on\r\nassemblies; the Dutch and Lutheran, on the contrary, constantly assist\r\nwhen divine service is performed in English, so that they may understand\r\nit; and their children, likewise, have all been baptized by ministers of\r\nthe church. Only the French Dissenters have deserted it, upon M.\r\nMoulinais, formerly one of the French ministers of New York, coming and\r\nsettling, now a year ago, among us; and it is also by his means and\r\ninducement that they have built a wooden meeting-house within the time\r\nthey were unprovided for, that is, from my predecessor's death to my\r\narrival here. * * *\r\n\r\n'There is no schoolmaster as yet in New Rochelle: the parents take care\r\nto instruct their own children, and that they do generally pretty well,\r\nbesides what instructions are given them in the church during summer by\r\nthe minister. * * * The number of slaves within New Rochelle is\r\nseventy-eight: part of them constantly attend divine service, and have\r\nhad some instruction in the Christian faith by the care and assistance\r\nof their respective masters and mistresses, so that my predecessor did\r\nnot scruple to baptize some, and even admit them to the communion of the\r\nLord's Supper; and I myself have, for the same consideration, baptized\r\nfifteen of them within these three years, some children and some grown\r\npersons, without the least prejudice to the rest of my flock.' It would\r\nbe well, in our boasted day of zeal and philanthropy, if all ministers\r\nof the blessed gospel manifested the same commendable interest for the\r\nspiritual welfare of the negroes, as this Huguenot pastor.\r\n\r\nAbout the period of the French war, he writes, June 5, 1758, 'that since\r\nthe war broke out, there have been great alterations in his\r\ncongregations, which have lost many of their members by removals, and by\r\nenlisting in the king's service, and by death; nevertheless, the number\r\nof his communicants is seventy-four, and he has baptized, within the\r\npresent half year, fifteen white and five black children.'\r\n\r\nThe ministry of this faithful Huguenot terminated on the earth, by his\r\ndeath in July, 1760. His biographer esteemed him a 'simple-minded,\r\nconscientious man, who for thirty-seven years continued faithfully to\r\ndischarge the duties of his mission.' His communicants had increased\r\nfrom thirty-eight to eighty, and he was greatly beloved by his\r\ncongregation. His remains were interred under the chancel of the old\r\nFrench church at New Rochelle, where so long he had watched over the\r\nlittle flock of his Master. M. Stouppe was succeeded by the\r\n\r\nRev. MICHAEL HOUDIN, A.M. He was born in France, 1705, educated a\r\nFranciscan friar, and, on Easter day, 1730, ordained a priest by the\r\nArchbishop of Treves, and subsequently preferred to the post of superior\r\nin the convent of the Recollects at Montreal. But, disgusted with\r\nmonastic life, M. Houdin, at the commencement of the French war, left\r\nCanada and retired to the city of New York. Here, on Easter day, 1747,\r\nhe made a public renunciation of Popery, and joined the Church of\r\nEngland. Attaining great proficiency in the English language, in June,\r\n1750, he was invited by the people of Trenton, N.J., to officiate as a\r\nmissionary in that State.\r\n\r\nWhen he first reached New York with his wife, in June, 1744, Governor\r\nClinton, suspicious of all Frenchmen at that moment, confined them to\r\ntheir lodgings, guarded by two sentinels. The following day he was\r\nexamined by his Excellency, and learned that 'the French intended to\r\nattack Oswego with eight hundred men, the French having a great desire\r\nof being masters of that place.' Then M. Houdin was ordered to reside at\r\nJamaica, Long Island, where he complained that his circumstances were\r\n'very low,' and 'can do nothing to get a living;' that 'his wife and\r\nhimself must soon come to want, unless his Excellency will be pleased to\r\ntake him into consideration.' After this appeal, the authorities advised\r\nhis return to the city, on his taking the oath of allegiance.\r\n\r\nFor some years, M. Houdin officiated at Trenton and the neighboring\r\nplaces as an 'itinerant missionary;' and in 1759 his services were\r\nrequired, as a guide, for General Wolfe, in his well-known expedition\r\nagainst Quebec. Before marching, he preached to the Provincial troops\r\ndestined for Canada, in St. Peter's church, Westchester, from St.\r\nMatthew, ch. x. 28: 'Fear not them which kill the body.' And the French\r\nchaplain escaped the dangers of the war; but his brave General, at the\r\nvery moment of victory, fell mortally wounded, on the Heights of\r\nAbraham, September 13, 1759. After the reduction of Quebec, he asked\r\nleave to join his mission again; but General Murray would not consent,\r\nas there was no other person who could be depended on for intelligence\r\nof the French movements. While M. Houdin was stationed at Quebec, an\r\nattempt was made by the Vicar-General of all Canada to seduce him from\r\nEnglish allegiance, with an offer of great preferment in the Romish\r\nChurch. This pressing invitation found its way into the hands of\r\nGenerals Murray and Gage, when they sent a guard to arrest the\r\nVicar-General.\r\n\r\nM. Houdin, returning to New York, in 1761, was appointed 'itinerant\r\nmissionary' to New Rochelle, by the 'Venerable Society' of England, 'he\r\nbeing a Frenchman by birth, and capable of doing his duty to them, both\r\nin the French and English languages.' During his incumbency, Trinity\r\nchurch, New Rochelle, received its first charter from George III., which\r\nthe present corporation still enjoys with all its trusts and powers. It\r\nis dated in 1762, and was exemplified by his Excellency George Clinton\r\nin 1793. In 1763 he writes, complaining that the Calvinists used\r\nunlawful methods to obtain possession of the church glebe. These were\r\nthe few old French Protestant families who had not conformed to the\r\nChurch of England; and Houdin says of them: 'Seeing the Calvinists will\r\nnot agree upon any terms of peace proposed to them by our church, * * *\r\nwe are in hopes the strong bleeding of their purse will bring them to an\r\nagreement after New York court.'\r\n\r\nThe French Protestant preacher continued his pious labors at New\r\nRochelle until October, 1766, when he departed this life. He was a man\r\nof considerable learning, irreproachable character, and esteemed a\r\nworthy Christian missionary. His remains, which were the last of the\r\nHuguenot pastors, were interred beneath the chancel of the old French\r\nchurch at New Rochelle, and by the side of his predecessors, Boudet and\r\nStouppe. Since the removal of this sacred edifice, the ashes of these\r\nearliest Protestant French missionaries to our land repose beneath the\r\npublic highway, and not a stone tells where they lie, or commemorates\r\ntheir usefulness, excellences, or piety. Their silent graves ought not\r\nthus to remain neglected and unhonored: some monumental record should\r\nmark the spot where these early Huguenot preachers in America were\r\nentombed.\r\n\r\nBoudet, Stouppe, and Houdin were the last of the Huguenot preachers in\r\nour land of whose histories we can find anything, and as they never can\r\nbe fully written, we have made a more full record of these fragments\r\nconcerning their memories, than otherwise would have been written.\r\nEspecially let the children of the French Protestants in Westchester\r\nvenerate these men, who were consecrated to sacred offices in the days\r\nof their pious ancestors, and, like Moses, led them from oppression and\r\nbondage to the land of Canaan in this Western World.\r\n\r\nWe might mention many who deserve the honor, among the descendants of\r\nthe New Rochelle Huguenots; but the name of one will suit our\r\npurpose--JOHN JAY. He was born in New York, from a family originally of\r\nLa Guienne, France; and he was sent, by his fellow citizens to the\r\nGeneral Congress which assembled at the commencement of the conflict\r\nbetween the colonies and England. In 1774 he signed the act of\r\nassociation to suspend the importation of British merchandise; in 1779\r\nhe was honored with the presidency of Congress. At the expiration of\r\nthis important post, Mr. Jay was commissioned to represent his country\r\nat the court of Louis XVI., and he was one of the four commissioners\r\nwho signed, on the 30th November, 1782, the treaty of Versailles, by\r\nwhich Great Britain recognized our NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE. A Huguenot,\r\nELIAS BOUDINOT, was the first president of the great national\r\ninstitution, the American Bible Society; and at his death, bequeathed to\r\nit a noble benefaction. The French Protestants were always ardent lovers\r\nof the BIBLE, and John Jay succeeded Mr. Boudinot in his important\r\noffice of president to that noble institution. 'No one in America,' says\r\nthe eminent Dr. Baird, 'need blush at having one of these respectable\r\nHuguenots among his ancestors;' and Bancroft, the historian of our land,\r\nrecognizes in them that moral elevation of which they gave so many\r\nproofs in every country where they settled; and he adds: 'The children\r\nof the French Calvinists have certainly good reason to hold the memory\r\nof their fathers in great honor.' (Vol. ii, p. 183.) So think we.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACCARONI AND CANVAS.\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nA WALK AROUND SEGNI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three quiet old places on the Continent that Caper always\r\nremembers with solemn pleasure--Breda in Holland, Segni in Italy,\r\nNeufchatel in Switzerland. He reposed in Breda, rested in Segni, was\r\nseverely tranquil in Neufchatel: the real charm of travelling is best\r\nappreciated when one is able to pause in one's headlong career in some\r\nsuch place and meditate over it. Caper paused for many months at Segni.\r\n\r\nSEGNI, or Signia, a Latium city of the Volscians, was, after its\r\ncolonization by the Romans, always faithful to the Republic. Strabo,\r\nPliny, Plautus, Martial, Juvenal, Silius, Italicus, Dionysius\r\nHalicarnassus, and Livy, all make mention, in one way or another, of\r\nthis city. Little is known of its history, from the fact that it was\r\nburned to the ground by the order of the Duke of Alva, viceroy of\r\nNaples, on the 14th of August, 1557; and in the fire all records of the\r\ncity were destroyed. Its polygonal or Cyclopean walls, of Pelasgic\r\norigin, still remain in many parts as perfect as they ever were:\r\nconsisting of gigantic blocks of hewn limestone, they are fitted one\r\ninto another with admirable precision; no mortar was used in laying\r\nthem, and there they stand, these well-named Cyclopean walls, for some\r\nof the stones are 12 feet long by 5 feet wide, firmly as if centuries on\r\ncenturies had not sent a myriad of storms to try their strength. There\r\nare several gates in these walls, noted among which is one called the\r\nSaracen's Gate; it is known in architecture from its indicating by its\r\nform one of the first attempts toward the pointed arch.\r\n\r\nIn walking through the town, you find here and there bits of middle-age\r\narchitecture, which have escaped ruin; here a door, there a window, of\r\ngraceful design, built around with the rough masonwork for which Segni\r\nis noted in later days; but the greater number of the houses are\r\nconstructed in the rudest manner, indicating the poverty and ignorance\r\nof the majority of the inhabitants. It is, however, a decent poverty,\r\nfor, to the credit of the town be it spoken, there was not, when Caper\r\nwas there, a professional beggar, excepting the friars, in or around it.\r\n\r\nTaking the first street--if a rough road winding around the top of the\r\nmountain, and but four or five feet wide, may be called so--Caper saw at\r\nthe doors of the houses, standing chatting to each other, many old\r\nwomen, their white hair flying in every direction, who, as they talked,\r\nknitted stockings; or, with distaff in hand, twirled the spindle, making\r\nflax into thread for spinning, or wool into woof and web for weaving.\r\nHearing a shuttle, he looked in at an open door, and found a young girl\r\nbusily weaving a heavy blue cloth at a queer old loom; not far from her,\r\nan elderly woman was weaving flax thread into coarse, heavy linen goods.\r\nPassing along, he heard the whir of millstones, and, entering a house,\r\nsaw a girl working one of the handmills of the country; on a stand,\r\nwhere there was a stone basin, the girl turned in the wheat; another\r\nstone, fitting exactly in the basin, was attached to the ceiling by a\r\nlong pole; catching hold of this, she gave the stone a rotary motion,\r\ngrinding the wheat very fairly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Caper saw in the back part of the room a woman, holding what\r\nseemed a large, red-headed caterpillar, without any fuzz on it; she was\r\nevidently nourishing it in the way represented in that famous painting\r\n'The Roman Daughter,' thus proving that it was a baby. Its resemblance\r\nto the caterpillar arose from the way it was swathed: around all the\r\nSegnian infants they wind a strip of knit or woven cloth, about eight\r\nfeet long and four inches wide, fairly mummifying them; then, to crown\r\nthe work, they put on their little bullet heads, a scarlet cap with\r\nbrilliant flowers and ribbons, making the poor babies resemble anything\r\nbut Christian productions. In a neighboring town they hang their babies\r\nup in a wicker basket, resembling the birch-bark contrivances for our\r\nIndian papooses.\r\n\r\nContinuing his walk, our artist next came to where they were building a\r\nhouse; and its future occupant, who was a man of some enterprise and\r\naction, told Caper, with a long face, that he almost despaired of seeing\r\nit completed: the harvest came, and almost every workman went off to the\r\nwheat fields, leaving the house unfinished until they were ready to\r\nrecommence work on it, well knowing that there were no other ones in the\r\ntown able to do their labor; however, those who mixed mortar, carried\r\ntiles, and stone, and plaster, were hard at work. These laborers were\r\ngirls of from twelve to sixteen years old, and one or two of them, spite\r\nof dirt and hard labor, were really handsome, with bright, intelligent\r\ncountenances. They earned one paul (ten cents) each a day, and seemed\r\ncontented and happy, joking with each other and laughing heartily nearly\r\nall the time. Probably our Chippewa Indians would think twice before\r\nthey set the young women of their tribe to hod-carrying as a livelihood;\r\nbut then the Chippewas are savages. The hods carried by these girls on\r\ntheir heads were flat, wooden trays, square at each end: once poised on\r\nthe head, they balanced themselves, and were carried around without a\r\nfall. This carrying on the head, by the women, from an eight-gallon\r\nbarrel of wine down to a sickle or pocket handkerchief, helps to give\r\nthem their straight forms and fine carriage of head, neck, and\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nNapoleon the First, in breaking down most of the feudal customs of the\r\nPapal States, should be regarded by the poor inhabitants as one of their\r\ngreatest benefactors; still, many a remnant of the middle ages remains\r\nfirmly marked in the habits of the country people. Even now the\r\ninhabitants of the Campagna live, not in isolated houses, but in small\r\ntowns built around the once protecting castle or powerful monastery,\r\nwhere, in times past, they fled, when attacked in the fields by the\r\nfollowers of some house inimical to the one under whose protection they\r\nlived. Follow the entire Campagna, from Rome to Naples, by way of\r\nFrosinone, and you will see the ruins of watch towers, built to warn the\r\nworkmen in the fields of the approaching enemy. Thus, in Segni, although\r\nthe fields cultured by the inhabitants, lay miles away at the foot of\r\nthe mountain, yet every day seven eighths of the 5,000 inhabitants\r\nwalked from four to six miles or more down the mountains to the scene of\r\ntheir daily labors, returning the same distance at sunset. Often and\r\noften Caper saw the mother, unable to leave the infant at home, carry it\r\nin a basket on her head to the far-away fields, bringing it back at\r\nnight with the additional burden of corn shelled or wheat garnered in\r\nthe field. Trotting along gayly at her side, you may be sure, was the\r\never-present black pig, with a long string wound around his body, by\r\nwhich he is attached to some tree or stone as soon as he reaches the\r\nfields, and thus prevented from rooting where he should not root. The\r\nday's labor of his mistress finished, she unties him, wraps the string\r\naround his body, and he follows her up to the town with the docility of\r\na well-trained dog.\r\n\r\nIt is the women, too, who daily walk four or five miles up the mountain\r\nfor their supply of firewood. Arriving at the forest of the commune,\r\nthey collect split wood and fagots, tying them into round bundles, a\r\nyard long, and two or three feet in diameter, and return to Segni,\r\ncarrying this small woodpile all the way on their heads. It is the\r\nwomen, too, who bring water from the fountains for their household use,\r\nin A copper vessels (_conche_) holding from two to three gallons: these\r\nare placed on the head, and carried self-balancing sometimes for long\r\ndistances. At a fair held at Frosinone, Caper once saw several women,\r\neach one carrying on her head two of these conche filled with water, one\r\nbalanced on the other; and this for half a mile up a steep road, from\r\nthe fountain at the foot of the mountain, to the town above.\r\n\r\nThe women, too, do their fair share of harvesting; they cut the wheat\r\nwith sickles; then, after it is cut, separate the grains from the stalk\r\nby rubbing a handful of stalks with a small piece of wood in which a\r\nseries of iron rings are placed, making a rude rasp; collecting the\r\ngrains, they then carry them from the fields, sifting them at their\r\nleisure in a large round sieve, suspended from a triangle of long poles;\r\nthen, on a breezy day, you may see them standing over a large cloth,\r\nholding a double handful of wheat high above their heads, and letting it\r\nfall: the wind blows away the chaff, and the clean grain falls on the\r\noutspread cloth.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, when the men are employed in the vintage, comes the\r\nchestnut season; and then the women, who are not busy in the vineyard,\r\nand who regard it as a frolic, go for miles up in the mountains,\r\ncollecting the nuts, large as our horse chestnuts. They form no small\r\npart of the winter stock of food for the mountaineers, while the refuse\r\nnuts are used to fatten the pet pig. We can have but small conception of\r\nthe primeval look these chestnut woods wear, the trees growing to an\r\nenormous size, many a one being ten to twelve feet in diameter. The\r\nweather is glorious during this season: clear, bright, and buoyantly\r\nrefreshing, blow the autumn winds; and as Caper, day after day, wandered\r\namong the old trees, now helping an old woman to fill a sack with the\r\nbrown nuts, now clubbing the chestnuts from the trees for a young girl,\r\nhe, too, voted chestnut gathering a rare good time. Far off, and now\r\nnear, the girls were singing their quaint wild songs. Thus heard, the\r\n_rondinella_ sounds well: it is of the woods and deserts; strange,\r\nbarbaric, oriental, bacchantic, what you please, save dawdling\r\ndrawing-room and piano-ic.\r\n\r\nTo resume the walk around the town: Caper, after leaving the man who was\r\nemploying the sylphide hod-carriers, called in at the shop were cigars\r\nwere sold, and outside of which was a tin sign, on which was painted the\r\npapal coat-of-arms, and the usual words, indicating that the government\r\nmonopolies, salt and tobacco, were for sale. Having bought some cigars,\r\nhe entered into conversation with the man who kept the store. He\r\nlearned, what he already knew, that everything in the town was done by\r\nhand, weaving, spinning, thrashing, grinding wheat and corn, &c.\r\n\r\n'Do you know,' said Caper, 'that in some countries all these labors are\r\ndone by steam?'\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous to tell great truths; and after our artist had spoken,\r\nhe saw, by the expression of the man's face, that he had placed himself\r\nin danger; but suddenly the cigar-seller's face was illuminated with\r\nintelligence, as he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Oh, you mean that infernal thing that goes _boo-hoo-hoo_? I saw it when\r\nI was in Rome, last week: it's going to drag cars to Civita Vecchia on\r\nthe iron road.'\r\n\r\n'That's it,' answered Caper, greatly relieved.\r\n\r\n'_Benissimo!_ we never had anything of the kind; and what is more, WE\r\nDON'T WANT ONE!'\r\n\r\nCaper walked out, determined to write to New York, and beg some of the\r\ngood people there to save a few missionaries from death among the\r\nFejees, and send them to Segni, where there was a wide field open for\r\nthe dissemination of knowledge.\r\n\r\nPassing along, he next came to the small square in front of the church,\r\nwhere once every week a market was held: here he found a man, who had\r\njust arrived with fresh fish from Terracina--the Terracina of the opera\r\nof 'Fra Diavolo.' Among the small fish, sardines, &c., which were\r\nbrought to town that day, in time for Friday's dinner, when every one\r\nkept _vigilia_, was one large fish, which our artist determined to buy\r\nand present to his landlord at the inn. He asked its price.\r\n\r\n'That fish,' said the fishman, 'is for the dinner of the Illustrissimo\r\nand Reverendissimo Monsignore the Bishop; and if you were to turn every\r\nscale in its body into baioccho, _and give them all to me_, you couldn't\r\nhave it.'\r\n\r\nCaper was sorely tempted to turn the scales in his own favor, for he\r\nknew, if he were to pay well, he could bear off the fish triumphantly,\r\nspite of the seller's declaration; but a thought of the sore affliction\r\nhe would bring into the mind of the fat old gentleman in purple, with a\r\ngold chain around his neck, who rejoiced in the name of bishop, deterred\r\nhim from his heretical proceeding, and he walked away in deep\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\nThe patron saint of Segni is San Bruno; and, to do him honor, every\r\nother male baby born in the town is called Bruno; so our artist, in his\r\nwalks around town, heard this name howled, cried, screamed, shrieked,\r\ncalled, and appealed to, on an average once in five minutes, through the\r\nhours when the male inhabitants were about and awake. This similarity in\r\nnames was, by no means, accompanied by similarity in appearance, for\r\nthere were more light-haired and blue-eyed men by this name in the place\r\nthan any one, having the popular idea of what an Italian looks like,\r\nwould believe could be found in a town of the same size in America.\r\nTrying to account for the Norse look of many of the Segnians, and the\r\nOriental look of many others, Caper climbed up to the top of the\r\nmountain above the town, and seating himself in the shadow of the old\r\nCyclopean wall, looked down the mountain side to the broad valley below\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'As all roads lead to Rome,'soliloquized he, 'it's no wonder that those\r\ntwo famous old ways down there in the valley, the Via Trajana and the\r\nVia Latina, should have once been passed over by white-haired, blue-eyed\r\nGoths, and, seeing the old town perched up here, they should have\r\nclimbed up, having strong legs. Once here, they put all the men to the\r\nsword, made love to the girls, plundered all that was plunderable; drank\r\nup all the liquor, Sambuca, Rosoglio, 'Rhum di Giamaica,' and Acqua\r\nviva, they could put their paws on; then, having a call further on, left\r\nthe girls, small babes, and other _impedimenta_ (baggage!), rushing onto\r\nRome to settle accounts with their bankers there, like hon-o-rable men.\r\n_So_ you find many flaxen-haired, sky-eyed people up here, and they are\r\nrough and bold and independent.\r\n\r\nYears and years after them, clambering over the mountains from the\r\nseacoast, came the Saracens--oh, you were the boys!--and they, being a\r\nrefined and elegantly educated circle, compared with the Goths, of\r\ncourse did the same amount of slaughtering and love-making, only more\r\nrefinedly and elegantly; cutting off heads instead of knocking them in;\r\nand with the gold spoons and other instruments that they found in the\r\nchurch, instead of making sword hilts and helmets, they at once worked\r\nthem into graceful, crescent-shaped earrings, and curious rings, chains,\r\nand brooches, giving them to the girls and winning their hearts in the\r\nold-fashioned style. The girls, for their part, declared to each other\r\nthat when these odious Moors went away, they would give all the earrings\r\nand brooches back to the church. But they forgot to; which accounts for\r\ntheir wearing them, or those of similar pattern, to this day.\r\n\r\nThe gentle Saracens, moreover, wishing to introduce their own school of\r\nmusic, taught the girls to sing; proof of which is the horrible songs\r\nthe contadini still have, resembling in no wise pious Christian hymns,\r\nbut rather a cross between a growl to Odin and a yell to Allah! A growl\r\nto Odin, for the girls could not forget the Goths, albeit they only knew\r\nthem through reports of their foremothers.\r\n\r\nThen the Saracens turned their attention to crockery ware, pots, pans,\r\nand water jars; forming like fruits and flowers the yielding clay, and\r\nestablishing models that are every hour to be seen around one in this\r\nold nest. Clothes, too, they thought, should be made as they saw 'fit;'\r\nand, accordingly, head-dresses and dresses, under garments, &c., _a la\r\nSaracenesca_, were all the rage; and as the colors were in no wise\r\nsombre or melancholy to behold, the girls took kindly to them, and,\r\nslightly modified, wear them still. When you see the _pane_, the white\r\ncloth worn on the women's heads, remember it was once an Oriental\r\n_yashmak_, falling around and concealing the face of the Italian lady\r\nlove of a Saracen; but when the Saracens departed, they rolled up the\r\nveil and disclosed to delighted Christians the features of Rita or\r\nMaria, who figured for a time as Zoe or Fatima.\r\n\r\nWith their religion, the Saracens were not so successful--they could not\r\nmake it popular; so they waived this point, contented with having set\r\nthe fashions, and introduced their own style of music, crockery, and\r\njewelry.\r\n\r\nThus reflecting, Caper stopped short, regarded his watch, found it was\r\nnear dinner time--the pastoral hour of noon-day--and then turned to walk\r\ndown to the inn. On his way he passed a store having French calicoes in\r\nthe window, and mourned in his heart to think how short a time it would\r\nbe before these became popular, and the homemade picturesque dresses of\r\nthe female Segnians would be discarded. The time, too, was fast\r\ncoming--with the railroad from Rome to Naples--when travellers will\r\noverrun these mountain towns, and the price of board shoot up from forty\r\ncents to a dollar or two: then the inhabitants will learn geography and\r\nbecome mercenary, and will learn arithmetic and blaspheme (in their way)\r\nat _forestieri Inglese_, _Americani_, _Francese_, or _Tedeschi_, and\r\ncheat them. Then the peace of the Volscians will have departed, never,\r\noh, never more to return.\r\n\r\nThen the women will wear--bonnets! and cheap French goods; will no\r\nlonger look like moving woodyards, bringing fagots on their heads down\r\nmountain sides; no longer bear aloft the graceful _conche_ filled with\r\nsweet water from the fountain, for hydraulic rams will do their\r\nbusiness; no longer lead the sportive pig to pastures new, but pen him\r\nup, and feed him when the neighbors are not looking on! These days will\r\nsorely try the men: now they labor in the fields in shirts and drawers,\r\nnever thinking of putting on their pantaloons until they return to the\r\nvery gates of the town, where, at sunset, you may see them, ten or\r\ntwelve deep, thus employed before entering the city; but in the future\r\nthey will have to observe _les convenances_ and make their toilette in\r\nthe fields. This they will do with great grumbling, returning homeward,\r\nand they will sing _rondinelle_ bearing severely on the _forestieri_ who\r\nhave ruined the good old pod-augur days when they made _vendetta_\r\nwithout trouble: thus reflecting, the donkeys they ride, while their\r\nwives walk and carry a load, will receive many virulent punches intended\r\nfor other objects.\r\n\r\n'Signor Giacomo, dinner is served,' said the landlord, as Caper entered\r\nthe old inn.\r\n\r\nCool wine, roast lamb, wild pigeons, crisp salad, with a broiled\r\npartridge; great bunches of luscious grapes, figs freshly picked, _and_\r\nmaccaroni a la Milanese. Such was our artist's dinner that day.\r\nPatriarchally simple of a necessity; but, then, what can you expect in a\r\ntown where the British Lion has never yet growled for a bushel of raw\r\nbeef when he is fed, or swore at the landlord for not having a pint of\r\nhay boiled in hot water (tea?) for breakfast, when he is nervous?\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE FAIRS AND FESTIVALS.\r\n\r\nDo not believe, in spite of all you hear about the benighted Papal\r\nStates, that the people spend their holidays groaning and begging to\r\ndepart from this vale of tears: on the contrary, the ignorant wretches\r\nbelieve in enjoying every moment of life; and, to judge by the Segnians,\r\nwho are by no means dyspeptical, they do so with all their might. They\r\nknow, if they fall sick, good Doctor Matteucci attends them carefully\r\nand well, without any charge, for he receives a salary from the commune.\r\nThey know, if they have good health and do their work, they will be\r\nrewarded every now and then with a holiday, in which religion is so\r\ntempered with lottery tickets, wine drinking, fireworks, horse races,\r\nand trading, that, shorn lambs as they are, paying to the church three\r\ncents for every twenty-five pounds of corn they may grind, and as large\r\na portion of their crops for the rent of the lands they till, they still\r\nhave jolly good times at the fairs and festivals in their own and\r\nneighboring towns.\r\n\r\nEvery town has its patron saint, and it is in honor of his day that they\r\nhold one grand festival each year. To accommodate temporal affairs, a\r\nfair is also held on the same day, so that the country people of the\r\nneighborhood may purchase not only the necessaries, but the simple\r\nluxuries they need or long for.\r\n\r\nBesides the only principal festival and fair in Segni to San Bruno,\r\nalready described, they had three minor celebrations of minor saints,\r\nsubstitutes, as Rocjean declared, for Pomona, Bacchus, and Ceres:\r\ncertainly, the saints' days fell very curiously about the same time\r\ntheir predecessors were worshipped.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, of five festivals and fairs held in five neighboring\r\ntowns, that the present chapter treats; so let the drums beat while our\r\nthree artists proceed to enjoy on paper the days they celebrated.\r\n\r\nOne evening, the vetturino, Francesco, came to the trio and told them\r\nthat on the next day but one, Sunday, there would be a fair and _festa_\r\nat Frosinone, a town about twenty-three miles from Segni, and that if\r\nthey wished to go, he had three seats to hire in his _vettura_. Having\r\nheard that the costumes to be seen there were highly picturesque, and\r\nanxious to study the habits of the people in holiday guise, our artists\r\ndetermined to go. At daybreak on the appointed morning, having\r\nbreakfasted and filled their flasks with wine, they started with a guide\r\nto walk down to Casa Bianca, a small _osteria_, distant, as the guide\r\nassured them, about two miles; three miles, as Francesco swore to; four\r\nmiles, as Gaetano, the landlord declared; and six miles as Caper and\r\nRocjean were ready to affirm to. Down the mountain road they scrambled,\r\nonly losing their patience when they found they had to wade a small\r\nmarsh, where their tempers and polished boots were sorely tried. Once\r\nover, they reached Casa Bianca, and found the vettura there, having\r\narrived an hour before from Rome, thirty odd (and peculiar) miles\r\ndistant; and now with the same horses they had to make twenty-three\r\nmiles more before ten A. M., according to agreement. Rocjean and Caper\r\nsat outside the carriage, while Dexter sat inside, and conversed with\r\ntwo other passengers, cheerful and good-natured people, who did all in\r\ntheir power to make everybody around them contented and jolly.\r\n\r\nThe road went through the fertile Sacco valley; right and left rich\r\npasture grounds, or wheat and corn fields; the mountains on either side\r\nrising in grandeur in the early sunlight, their tops wreathed with veils\r\nof rising mist. They soon passed Castelaccio (the termination _accio_ is\r\none, according to Don Boschi, of vilification; consequently, the name\r\nmay be translated Bigbad Castle): this castle belongs to Prince\r\nTorlonia, apropos of which prince it is rather singular that all his\r\nmoney cannot buy good Latin; for any one may read at Frascati, staring\r\nyou in the face as it does, as you wind up the villa, engraved on a\r\nlarge marble tablet, an inscription touching\r\n\r\n   TORLONIA ET UXSOR EJUS, ETC.\r\n\r\nUXSOR may be Latin, but it is the kind that is paid for, and not the\r\nspontaneous gift of classic Italy.\r\n\r\nThe carriage next passed through Ferentino, _Ferentinum_ of the\r\nVolscians, where it stopped for a time to let Rocjean see the stone\r\ncalled _La Fata_, whereon is inscribed the noble generosity of\r\nQuintilius Priscus, who gave _crustula_ and _mulsum_ (cakes and mead) to\r\nthe old people; _sportulae_ (cold victuals?) to the decurions, and _nucum\r\nsparsiones_ (a sprinkling of nuts) for the small children.\r\n\r\nAfter which antiquarian research, and a drink of wine at the _Hotel des\r\nEtrangeres_, the trio called loudly on Francesco to drive on; for the\r\nname of the inn suggested similar signboards, Hotel d'Angleterre, Hotel\r\nVitoria, Hotel des Isles Brittaniques, at all of which one or other of\r\nour travellers had been savagely fleeced.\r\n\r\nThe carriage at last arrived at the tavern, at the foot of the mountain\r\non which Frosinone stands, and our artists found that the ascent must be\r\nmade on foot: this, in the face of the broiling sun, was equal to two\r\nhot baths at least. However, they determined to take it easily, and\r\naccordingly tarried for a while by an old bridge crossing a small\r\nstream, running bright and clear, where cattle were drinking; then they\r\nstopped at the neighboring fountain, where the girls were filling copper\r\nwater jars, and dusty contadini were washing themselves in order to\r\npresent a clean face at the fair; and listened with pleasure to the\r\nhearty laughter and holiday jests bandied about with profusion. Thus in\r\nrefreshed spirits they commenced the ascent.\r\n\r\nOn the brow of the mountain, in front rank of the houses of the city,\r\narose the walls of what they thought at first glance was a very large\r\nfactory; they subsequently learned it was a male-factory or prison;\r\nthis, with the governor's palace and other lofty buildings, gives\r\nFrosinone a stately air, only lost on entering the place and finding\r\nthe streets narrow, steep, and not particularly clean. On entering the\r\nstreet leading to the main gate of entrance, their ears were saluted by\r\nthe squealing and grunting of many hogs collected together in small\r\ndroves, on both sides the way, for sale or barter. Here stood a bronzed\r\npeasant, dressed only in shirt and drawers, with boots up to his knees;\r\na steeple crowned straw hat, with a large carnation pink in it, shading\r\nhis closely shaved face, on which no hair was seen save two long curls\r\npendent in front of his ears, while the back part of his head was shaved\r\nnearly as smooth as his face. This man held in his arms a small pig in a\r\nviolent state of squeals. Mixed up among the pigs were many women\r\ndressed in lively colored costumes, looking graceful and pretty, and\r\ngaining added effect from the dark tones of the old gray houses around\r\nthem. Advancing upward, at times at angles of forty-five degrees and\r\nmore, through narrow streets crowded with picturesque houses (if they\r\ndid threaten to tumble down), they at last reached the Piazza: here the\r\nsqueeze commenced, crockery, garlic, hardware, clothing, rosaries and\r\npictures of the saints, flowers; while donkeys, gensdarmes, jackasses,\r\nand shovel hats, strangers, and pretty girls were all pressing with\r\nmight and main--they did not seem to know where--probably to the nearest\r\nwine shops, which were driving a brisk trade.\r\n\r\nReaching an inn, our artists ordered dinner, and amused themselves,\r\nwhile it was being prepared, looking out of the window at the crowds in\r\nthe street beneath. On the opposite side of the way were two open\r\nwindows, evidently 'behind the scenes' of the main church, since many of\r\nthe principal actors in the ceremonies were here attiring themselves in\r\ncurious robes prior to their appearing in public. A tallow-faced looking\r\nyouth, with no hair on the extreme crown of his head, while swinging a\r\nlong wax candle around, struck a fat old gentleman, with a black silk\r\ngown and white lace bertha over it, in the back; whereupon, I regret to\r\nwrite it, the fat old gentleman struck the tallow-faced youth the\r\nseverest kind of a blow below the belt, entirely contrary to the rules\r\nof the P. R. Dexter, having watched the performance, at its conclusion\r\nshouted for very joy; whereupon the stout man, raising his eyes, saw in\r\nthe opposite windows the three _forestieri_, and I do assure you that\r\nsuch a look of malevolence as crossed his face for a moment contained\r\nall the Borgias ever knew of poisons and assassinations. Luckily, the\r\nartists did not have to go to confession to that man.\r\n\r\nDinner finished, Rocjean proposed a walk. They first went to the old\r\nchurch, but found its interior ruined with whitewash and tawdry\r\ndecorations. The music, however, was excellent, but the crowd of\r\nworshippers intense; so they repaired to the cattle market, in the\r\npiazza in front of the prison. They had been there but a short time,\r\nbefore the procession in honor of the patron saint of Frosinone, whose\r\nfull-length seated effigy was carried by bearers, passed them. Along\r\nwith other emblems borne by priests or laymen was a cross, apparently of\r\nsolid wood, the upright piece fully twelve feet long, and as large round\r\nat the base as your thigh; the transverse piece of the cross was\r\nproportionately large; this was borne with ease by a moderate-sized man.\r\nCaper was at a loss to account for the facility with which the bearer\r\nhandled pieces of timber as large as small joists of a house; so he\r\nasked a good-natured looking citizen standing near him, if that wooden\r\ncross was not very heavy?\r\n\r\n'Eh! that heavy? Why, it's not wood; it's made of stove-pipes!'\r\n\r\nThe citizen also told Caper that the seated effigy of the patron saint\r\nhad had a hard time of it some years ago, for the country around\r\nFrosinone suffering from a long drought, the inhabitants had in vain\r\nprayed, begged, and supplicated the aforementioned saint to send them\r\nrain; but he remained obdurate, until at last, seeing him so stubborn,\r\nthey seized him, in spite of the priests, carried him down to the\r\nbridge, neck and heels, and threatened him, by all his brother and\r\nsister saints, to put him to bed--bed of the stream (it was nearly\r\ndry)--unless he speedily gave them a good supply of rain. In a couple of\r\ndays, sure enough, the rain came down, and in such torrents, that there\r\nwas a grand rush of the country people from the vicinity, begging the\r\nsaint to hold up. Since that time he has behaved very decently, and just\r\nnow is in high favor.\r\n\r\nThere were some fine cattle at the fair; and Dexter, noticing a peculiar\r\nand becoming headdress to several of the long-horned oxen, made of the\r\nskin of some animal, ornamented with bright-colored strips of woollen\r\nwith tassels at the end, tried to purchase a pair, but found the owners\r\ngenerally unwilling to sell them: however, one man at last agreed to\r\nsell a pair made of wolf-skin, with bright red, yellow, and green strips\r\nand tassels, for a fair price, and Dexter at once bought them--as a\r\nstudy, and also as an ornament for his studio.\r\n\r\nThe tombola in the Piazza Tosti drew together a large crowd; and then it\r\nwas that Rocjean was in his element, Caper delighted, and Dexter\r\nrejoiced in the study of costumes and motives for paintings. The straw\r\nhats worn here looked more picturesque than the black felt conical hats\r\nof the other end of the valley, but the 'soaplocks' of the men were\r\nvillanous. The women were brilliant in holiday attire, among their\r\ndresses showing that half-modern Greek, half Neapolitan style, uniting\r\nthe classic with the middle age. The _ciociare_, as those who wear\r\n_ciocie_ or sandals are called, were there in full force: one of these\r\nmen, with whom Rocjean had a long conversation, told our artist that the\r\nprice paid for enough leather for a pair was forty cents. Each sandal is\r\nmade of a square piece of sole leather, about twelve inches long by five\r\ninches wide, and is attached to the foot by strings crossing from one\r\nside to the other, and bending the leather into the rough resemblance of\r\na shoe. The leather is sold by weight, and the _ciociara_ declared that\r\nsandals were far better than shoes.\r\n\r\n'But, when it rains, your feet are wet,' suggested Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'_Seguro_' (certainly), answered _ciociara_.\r\n\r\n'And when it snows, they are wet; and when it is muddy, they won't keep\r\nthe mud out; and when it's dusty, where is the dust?'\r\n\r\n'Down there in the Campagna!' answered the man. 'But you seem to forget\r\nthat we wrap cloths over our feet and legs, as high as the knee, and tie\r\nthem all on with strings; or else our women knit brown woollen leggings,\r\nwhich cover our feet and legs. Well, good or bad, they are better for\r\n_us_ (_noi oltri_) than shoes.'\r\n\r\nFireworks and a ball at the Governor's palace closed that saint's day;\r\nand the next afternoon our artists left the town to return to Segni; but\r\nas toward midnight they began to ascend the long, steep road leading to\r\nthe town, they were overtaken by a thunderstorm, which for grandeur\r\nequalled anything that Caper at least had ever seen. The lightning was\r\nnearly incessant, at one flash revealing the valley below them, and\r\ndistant mountain peaks after peaks trembling in white light, then all\r\nblack as black could be; patches of road in front of the old carriage,\r\nsilver one second, sable another; while the thunder cracked and roared,\r\nechoing and reechoing from rock to rock, ringing away up the wild gorge\r\naround which the road wound. The rain fell in torrents, and pebbles and\r\nstones loosened from the mountain sides came falling around them.\r\nFrancesco, the driver, on foot, urged the tired horses onward with\r\nblows and the most powerful language he could bring to bear; he accused\r\nthe off-horse of being a pickpocket and an _arciprete_, and a robber of\r\na small family, of which Francesco assured him he knew he was the\r\nfather. Then the mare Filomena came in for her share of vilifications,\r\nbeing called a '_giovinastra_ (naughty girl), a _vecchierellaccia_ (vile\r\nold hag), a--' Here the rain, pebbles, lightning, and thunder\r\ninterrupted the driver, and Rocjean told him to take breath and a pull\r\nat his flask, which was filled with _Sambuca_. Thus refreshed, although\r\nsoaked to the skin, Francesco livened up, and from despondency passed to\r\nhope, then to joy, finally landing the old carriage near the gate of\r\nSegni, in time for the artists to see far below them the clouds rolling\r\nrapidly away, and hear the thunder grumbling far off, over some other\r\ntown, some other benighted travellers.\r\n\r\nVALMONTONE was the next town visited, and the festival in honor of its\r\npatron saint, Luigi Gonzago, was a decided success; the singing in the\r\nchurch operatically excellent; a good-sized tombola; a funny dinner in\r\nthe back room of a grocery store, one half of the floor of which was\r\ncovered with shelled corn, while the other half was occupied by the\r\nunited legs of two tables, a dozen chairs, four dogs, one cat, six male\r\nand three female country people. There was a lamb roasted whole, a small\r\nbarrel of wine, plenty of bread, find-your-own-knives-and-be-happy\r\ndinner. Coming out of this small den, and passing a fine large house,\r\nopposite the grand palace of the Prince of Valmontone, behold an Italian\r\nacquaintance of Caper's standing in a balcony with a very handsome\r\nwoman; another moment, and Caper was invited in, and passed from poverty\r\nto wealth in the twinkling of an eye. Rooms full of guests, tables\r\ncovered with damask linen, silver, flowers, crystal glasses, delicate\r\nfood (too late!), good wine (just in time!), charming ladies.\r\n\r\n'_Condessa_, permit me to present Signor' Cahpeer, Americano.'\r\n\r\nA rich, full, musical voice, lovely eyes, a brilliant toilette--is it\r\nany wonder the heart of our artist beat _con animo_, when the beautiful\r\nwoman welcomed him to Valmontone, and hoped it would not be his last\r\nvisit. Other introductions, other glasses of sparkling wine--then off\r\nfor the street, excitement, music, coffee, and a cigar; pretty girls\r\nwith tender eyes; the prince's stables, with hawks nailed to the doors,\r\nand blood horses in their stalls; contadini, cowbells, jackasses; ride\r\nhome on horseback by moonlight; head swimming, love coming in, fun\r\ncoming out. Exit festival the second.\r\n\r\nGAVIGNANO was the scene of the third festival; it is a small town, lying\r\nat the foot of Segni. Caper went there on horseback, and, after a\r\nregular break-neck ride down the mountain, the path winding round like a\r\nstring on an apple, arrived there in time to escape a pouring rain, and\r\nfind himself in a large hall with three beautiful sisters, the Roses of\r\nMontelanico, numerous contadini friends, and the wine bottles going\r\nround in a very lively and exhilarating manner. The rain ceasing, Caper\r\nwalked out to see the town, when his arm was suddenly seized, and,\r\nturning round, who should it be but Pepe the rash, Pepe the\r\npersonification of Figaro: a character impossible for northern people to\r\nplace outside of a madhouse, yet daily to be found in southern Europe.\r\nRash, headstrong, full of deviltry, splendid appetite, and not much\r\nconscience--volatile, mocking, irrepressible.\r\n\r\nPepe seized Caper by the arm with a loud laugh, and, only saying,\r\n'_Evviva_, Signor' Giacomo, come along!' without giving him breathing\r\ntime, rushed him up narrow streets, down dirty alleys, through a crowd\r\nof mules, mud, and mankind, until they both caught a glimpse of a small\r\nchurch with green garlands over the door. Hauling Caper inside, he\r\ndragged him through a long aisle crowded with kneeling worshippers,\r\nsmashed him down on a bench in front of the main altar, tearing half a\r\nyard of crimson damask and nearly upsetting the priest officiating; and\r\nthen, while Caper (red in the face, and totally unfit to hear the fine\r\nchorus of voices, among which Mustafa's, the soprano, came ringing out)\r\nwas composing himself to listen, Pepe grabbed him with a 'Music's over;\r\n_andiamo_ (let's go). Did you hear Mustafa? _Bella voce_, tra-la-leeeee!\r\nMustafa's a contadino; I know his pa and ma; they changed him when only\r\nfive years old. Thought he was a Turk, didn't you? He sings in the\r\nSistine chapel. Pretty man, fat; positively not a sign of a beard.'\r\n\r\nStruggling to escape, Caper was rushed out of church, and into a _caffe_\r\nto have a tumblerful of boiling coffee poured down his throat, and again\r\nbe expressed up hill at a break-neck rate, catching sights of\r\ntumble-down old houses, mud, water, flowers, peasants, costumes,\r\ndonkeys, until he was landed in the Gran' Piazza. Whew!\r\n\r\n'Must see the hall where the concert is to-night. Beautiful girl,\r\n_bellisima, pfisp!_ (imitating kiss) girl from Rome; sings three pieces,\r\nErnani, Norma, _pfisp!_ Come along!\r\n\r\nSmack, bang! into the hall, where the silence and presence of a select\r\nfew, including Monsignore and the Governatore in council assembled,\r\ncommanded silence: Pepe wouldn't hear of it anywheres, so again they\r\nwere in the open air; the band was playing good music in the square, the\r\ntombola was about to commence, and contadini were busy with pencils and\r\ntickets, ready to win the eighty scudi put up.\r\n\r\nTombola commenced, and Pepe at once supervised all the tickets within\r\nreach. 'Bravo, twenty-seven! you've got it, Tonio; scratch it, my\r\nlamb.--You haven't, Santi, _poverino mio_.--It's _non c'e_,\r\nAngeluccio.--Ah, Bruno, always lucky.--Fifty-four, _Santa Maria_, who\r\nwould have thought it?--_Caro_ Bernardo, _only_ one more number to win\r\nthe terno!'\r\n\r\nSomebody won the tombola at last, and Pepe told Caper he should wait for\r\nthe fireworks and the concert. 'Beautiful girl, ah, _bella_, sings three\r\npieces;' here he burst out with that song\r\n\r\n   _'Ninella mia di zucchero,\r\n   Prende 'sto core, ed abbraccialo;_'\r\n\r\nnot waiting for the end of which, Caper interrupted him by saying that\r\nhe should not wait for the evening, as he intended returning to Segni at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n'Will you?' asked Pepe. 'Oh, _bravo!_ good idea. Concert room will be\r\ncrowded to suffocation; get hot, perspire, catch cold. Fireworks\r\nnothing. I'll go with you; great fools to wait. Here is a wine-shop; let\r\nus refresh!'\r\n\r\nIn they went, and finished a quart, after which Pepe proposed visiting\r\nanother wine-shop, where they had some frascati, good and sweet. So he\r\nhurried Caper along so fast through mud and narrow streets, all the way\r\ndown hill, that his feet could not begin to hold on the slippery stones,\r\nand both went ahead on the plan of not being able to stop; at last they\r\nreached a landing place, where the wine was sold; hastening in, they\r\nnearly fell over a tall, splendid-looking girl, who was standing in the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n'_Iddio!_ it's my _cara_ Giulia, lovely as ever. Come with us and finish\r\na bottle; this is our friend Giacomo, Americano, brave youth,\r\n_allegro_!'\r\n\r\n'It pleases me well to make the acquaintance of the Signor; I have often\r\nseen him in Segni--'\r\n\r\n'And _now_ you'll fall in love with him,\r\n\r\n   _E tu non pienz' a mi_,''\r\n\r\nsang Pepe. 'This comes of my headlong hurry introducing pretty girls to\r\ninteresting strangers. Ah, _bella_, Giulia!\r\n\r\n'_Zitto!_ Pepe, and pour me out a glass of wine.'\r\n\r\nPepe poured out the wine, one glass after another. Suddenly springing\r\nfrom his seat, he said, 'Wait here a minute. I see Gaetano: will be back\r\nagain _prestissimo!_'\r\n\r\nHe went, and Caper and Giulia were left seated, talking merrily over the\r\nwine. There were stars shining when Giulia bid good night to Caper, yet\r\nPepe did not return; he had seized some new idea, may-be the pretty\r\nRoman who sang at the concert. Then Caper saddled his horse and rode out\r\ninto the night--glad that he had met black-eyed Giulia.\r\n\r\nThe night rides up the mountain! Here's romance, real and beautiful. Are\r\nyou not treading an old Roman road, over which the legions have marched\r\nto victory, war chariots rattled? Up the mountains, on the old road once\r\nleading over the mountains to Terracina, the _Tarracina_ of the Romans,\r\nwho made it one of their naval stations; up that road you go, trusting\r\nsolely to your horse, one slip of whose foot would send you into\r\neternity _via_ a ravine some hundred feet sheer down. Here, bright light\r\nfrom a _casina_ where the contadini are loading mules with grapes to be\r\npressed in the city up there near the stars! High above you, nothing but\r\na wall of black rock, up, up, so high! Stars gleaming down, the comet\r\ntailing from side to side of the ravine, while the path in the ragged,\r\njagged, storm-gullied rock is so dark you see nothing: your horse stops,\r\nhis hind feet slip--no! he clings, his hoofs are planted firm; up he\r\ngoes, and there, in the hands of Providence, you are tossed and pitched,\r\nas he winds up and plunges down. The merry ringing, jingling bells of\r\nmules ahead, and the voices of their drivers: turn a corner, and the\r\nbright light of torches flashes in your eyes. Look again and earnestly\r\nat the beautiful scene: mules, drivers, black rocks, olive trees above,\r\nall flamboyant in the ruddy light, appearing and disappearing; a weird,\r\nwild scene. Up, up, long is the way; past the fountain where the stars\r\nare flashing in the splashing waters; past gardens; past the mountain\r\npath at last. _Ecco_, the inn of Gaetano.\r\n\r\nANAGNI held its festival in honor of San Magno (_Prottetore della\r\nCitta_) on the 19th day of August. Gaetano, the landlord, invited Caper\r\nto attend it, putting his famous white horse at the disposal of the\r\nartist, accompanying him on a small bay beast that was extremely fond of\r\nshowing his heels to the surrounding objects. Leaving Segni about ten\r\no'clock in the morning, they had hardly reached a bridle path down the\r\nmountain, nothing more in fact than a gully, when they were joined by a\r\ncavalcade of four other Segnians. One of them, the 'funny fellow' of the\r\nparty, was mounted on a very meek-looking donkey, and enlivened the hot\r\nride across the valley of the Sacco by spasmodic attempts to lead the\r\ncavalcade and come in ahead of the others. He had a lively time as they\r\napproached the city, and a joke with every foot passenger on the way;\r\nbut Gaetano, whose reserve was one of his strong points, and who was\r\nanxious to enter Anagni under favorable auspices, gave the word to\r\nCaper, and in a few minutes they left cavalcade and donkey-rider far\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nAnagni, the ancient _Anagnia_, was the capital of the Hernici. The\r\nfavorite residence, in the middle ages, of several of the popes, it\r\nstill shows in its building marks of the wealth it once enjoyed. Having\r\nstabled their horses with a friend of Gaetano's, who insisted on their\r\nfinishing the best part of a _bottiglia_ of red wine with him, the\r\nartist, under the landlord's guidance, set out to see the town. They\r\nclimbed up street to the cathedral, a fine old pile trembling with music\r\nand filled with worshippers, paintings of saints in extremis, flowers,\r\nwax candles, votary offerings, and heat; then coming out, and feeling\r\nwolfish, looked round for a place where they could find dinner! Here it\r\nwas! a scene that would have cheered Teniers: a very large room, its\r\nwalls brown with smoke; long wooden tables, destitute of cloth, but\r\ncrowded with country people eating, drinking, talking, enjoying\r\nthemselves to the utmost extent. Forks were invisible, but every man had\r\nhis own knife, and Caper, similarly provided, whipped out his long\r\npocket weapon and commenced an attack on roast lamb and bread, as if\r\ntime were indeed precious. Wine was provided at Fair price; and, with\r\nfruit, he managed to cry at last, 'Hold, enough!'\r\n\r\nGaetano, having a message for a young priest in the seminary there,\r\nasked Caper how he would like to see the interior of the building, and\r\nthe way the _prete_ lived? Caper assenting, they entered a fine large\r\nestablishment with broad walls and high ceilings, and mounting to the\r\nsecond story and knocking at the door of a chamber, they were admitted\r\nby a tall, thin, sallow young man, about eighteen years old, evidently\r\nthe worse for want of exercise, and none the stronger minded for his\r\nnarrow course of education and instruction.\r\n\r\nGaetano introduced Caper to the young priest, and the artist, who, a\r\nmoment before entering the room, was as lively as the Infant Bacchus, at\r\nonce became melancholy as the Infant Samuel, and a feeling of such pity\r\nseized him, that, endeavoring not to show it, he turned it into a\r\nsentiment of interest in the young priest and his surroundings, admiring\r\nthe beautiful view from the window, and, turning inward to a poor wreath\r\nof paper flowers hanging over a holy-water fount attached to the wall,\r\npraised for their resemblance to natural flowers. (Was that untruth\r\nunforgiven?)\r\n\r\n'I made them,' said the young priest; 'but they are nothing to the ones\r\nI have made for our church in Montelanico. I will show those to you.'\r\nOpening a large paper box, he showed Caper wreaths and festoons of paper\r\nflowers. 'I have spent weeks on weeks over them,' he continued, 'and\r\nthey will decorate the church at the next _festa_. I spend all my\r\nleisure hours making artificial flowers.'\r\n\r\nIn answer to a question from Caper of the dress he then wore was the\r\nusual one worn by the seminarists on important occasions, the young\r\npriest answered him that it was not, and at once produced the full\r\ndress, putting on the upper garment, a species of cassock, in order to\r\nshow him how it looked. He next called his attention to a curious old\r\nwork, full of engravings illustrating the different costumes of the\r\ndifferent orders of priests, and was in full discourse to describe them\r\nall, when Gaetano told him that he was sorry, but that he had to go, as\r\nhe had some matters to attend to at the fair. So Caper bid the young\r\npriest good-by, saying he regretted that he had not time to further\r\nstudy the ecclesiastical costumes. A feeling of relief seized him when\r\nhe was once more in the open air--thoughts of gunning, fishing,\r\nfighting, anything, so long as it was not the making paper flowers by\r\nthat poor, pale-faced boy: it was terrible!\r\n\r\nThere are several resident families in Anagni having titles; these are\r\nknown as the _stelle d'Anagni_ (stars of Anagni), and number among the\r\nladies many beautiful faces, if those pointed out to him were the true\r\nstars. But it was, while smoking a cigar over a cup of coffee, that he\r\nsaw enter the cafe without exception one of the loveliest and most\r\nattractive women he met in Italy. The word _simpatica_, so often used by\r\nItalians, expressing, as it does, so much in so short a space, exactly\r\napplied to the charming woman who passed him, as she entered the room\r\nwhere he was seated. She was accompanied by several gentlemen, one of\r\nwhom, on whose arm she leaned, having the most character of all the\r\nothers in his face, and the finest-looking man in figure and carriage,\r\nCaper selected as her husband--and he was right.\r\n\r\nGaetano, having finished his business, soon entered the cafe in company\r\nwith a dashing, handsome-looking man, in half ecclesiastical costume;\r\nfor though he wore a shovel hat and long-tailed black frock coat, yet\r\nhis other clothes, though black, had the air of being made by an _a la\r\nmode_ tailor. His manner was cordial, frank, hearty. He proposed a walk\r\naround the town, to see what was going on among the _villani_. Caper\r\ncalling his attention to the lady mentioned above, the ecclesiastic,\r\nmaking his excuses for his sudden leave, at once hurried over to salute\r\nher, and was evidently very cordially received. He returned in a few\r\nminutes to Caper.\r\n\r\n'It is the _Principessa ----_, and she insists on having an introduction\r\nto the American. She is making the _villegiatura_ among these mountain\r\ntowns for a frolic. She will be in Segni, with her husband, the Signor\r\n----, and it will be pleasant for you to know them while there.'\r\n\r\n'Introduce me by all means. She is the most beautiful woman I have seen\r\nin Italy.'\r\n\r\nThe introduction was made, and our artist surpassed himself in\r\nconversing intelligibly, much to the delight of the fair Italian and her\r\nfriends, who declared they were prepared to converse with him solely by\r\nsigns. Promising that when they came to Segni he should not fail to call\r\nupon them, and give them a long account of the savage life he lived\r\namong his Indian brethren in America, he laughingly bid them good day.\r\n\r\nThe dashing priest now went with Caper and Gaetano through the crowded\r\nstreets, pointing out objects of interest, architectural and human; past\r\nbooths where all kinds of merchandise was exposed for sale, out to see\r\nthe ancient massive walls of travertine, where divers stunning objects\r\nwere carved, inscriptions, &c. Then they found a wine shop, where it was\r\ncool and tolerably quiet, and smoked and drank until sunset, having much\r\nsport conversing with the amiable _villane_, who were as comfortably\r\ntipsy as their circumstances would permit. At sunset, the Piazza Grande\r\nwas brilliant with hangings, crimson and gold, and colored tapestry hung\r\nfrom the windows of the surrounding houses. Here the tombola was held,\r\nand here the crowd was excited as usual; the lucky ones bearing off the\r\nprizes were in such rapturous state of bliss--'one might have stuck pins\r\ninto them without their feeling it.'\r\n\r\nAbout sunset, Gaetano and Caper saddled their horses, and left the city,\r\nstriking over the valley to Segni, passing on the road country people\r\nmounted on donkeys, or travelling along on foot, nine tenths of whom\r\nwere vigorously canvassing--the life of Saint Magno?--no, indeed, but\r\nthe chances of the lottery!\r\n\r\nThere was to have been the next day, at Anagni, a curious chase of\r\nbuffaloes, in accordance with some passage in the life of San Magno, as\r\nthe people said; but, according to Rocjean, more probably some neglected\r\nceremony of the ancient heathens, which the party in power, finding they\r\ncould not abolish, gracefully tacked on to the back of the protector of\r\nthe city. These kind of things are done to an alarming extent around\r\nRome; and the Sieur de Rocjean, when he lost his calendar containing the\r\ndates of all the festivals, said it was of no importance--he had and\r\nexcellent Lempriere!\r\n\r\nThe fifth festival--if you have patience to read about it--was held at\r\nGENAZZANO, and was decidedly the most celebrated one of the season. It\r\ncame off on the 8th of September, and for costumes, picturesqueness, and\r\ngeneral effect, might have been called, to copy from piano literature,\r\n_Le Songe d'un Artiste_.\r\n\r\nThe town itself looks as if it had just been kicked out of a theatre.\r\nRound towers at entrance gates, streets narrow and all up hill, the\r\ntiles on the houses running down to see what is going on in the gutter,\r\nquaint old houses, gray with time, with latticed windows, queer old\r\ndoors, a grand old castle in ruins. It is one of the scenes you long so\r\nmuch to see before you come abroad, and which you so seldom find along\r\nthe Grande Route. Spend a summer in the mountain towns of Italy! among\r\nthe Volscian mountains or hills--and have your eyes opened.\r\n\r\nAs Caper entered the gate, the first objects meeting his sight were: a\r\nprocession of genuine pilgrims, dressed precisely as you see them in\r\nRobert le Diable, or Linda di Chamouni, or on the stage generally--long\r\ngray robes down to their feet, cocked hats with cockle shells, long\r\nwands; some barefoot, some with sandals: on they passed, singing\r\nreligious songs. Then came the peasantry, all in perfect theatrical\r\nharmony, costumes rigidly correct _a la Sonnambula_. German artists\r\ndressed in Sunday clothes _a la Der Freyschutz_. A cafe with festoons of\r\nlemon-peel hung from window to window--they are not up to this idea in\r\n_Fra Diavolo_. Pretty girls in latticed windows, with red boddices,\r\nwhite sleeves, flowers in their hair--_legitimate Italian drama_.\r\nCrockery-ware in piles--_low comedy_. A man with a table, Sambuca and\r\nAcqua-vita bottles on it, and wee glasses, one cent a drink:\r\n_melodrama_. Fresh oranges and figs, pumpkin-seed and pine cones; a\r\nhouse with mushrooms strung on thread, hanging from window to\r\nwindow--this was not for festival display, but is the common way of the\r\ncountry. Notices of the _festa_, containing programme of the day,\r\nincluding amusements, ecclesiastical and secular, hung up alongside the\r\nstands where they were selling lottery tickets--_tragedy_. Fountains,\r\nwith groups of peasantry drinking, or watering horses and\r\ndonkeys--_pantomime_. Priests, in crow-black raiment, and canal-boat or\r\nshovel hats--_mystery_. Strangers from Rome, in the negro-minstrel style\r\nof costume, if young men; or in the rotund-paunch and black-raiment\r\ndress, if elderly men; or in the _chiffonee_ style, if Roman women\r\nattempting the last Parisian fashion--_farce_.\r\n\r\nHere are the booths with rosaries, crucifixes, Virgin Mary's holy-water\r\nholders, medals of Pio Nono, or jewelry; gold crescent earrings,\r\n_spadine_ (long silver hair pins); silver hearts, legs, arms, for votive\r\nofferings, and crosses without number.\r\n\r\nCaper entered the church; it was filled, and stifling with heat and\r\nfrankincense, and contadini, and wax lights burning before the shrine,\r\non which the sun shone. There were beautiful faces among the _pajine_\r\n(people in fine raiment), showing what can be made from the _contadine_\r\n(people in coarse clothes) by not overworking them.\r\n\r\nOnce more our artist was in the pure air, and, walking up the main\r\nstreet, came to a house with a beautifully carved stone window, half\r\nByzantine, half Gothic, while a house on the opposite side of the street\r\nboasted of two other windows finely carved. While looking at them, Caper\r\nwas hailed by name, and a stout, fresh-colored English artist, named\r\nWardor, whom he had known in Rome, came over and welcomed him to\r\nGenazzano. Wardor, it turned out, was spending the summer there, as he\r\nhad done the year before; consequently, there was not a nook or corner\r\nin the old town he did not know; and if he had not been so lazy, he\r\ncould have filled his sketch book with a hundred picturesque studies.\r\nBut no; with the keenest appreciation of every bit of color, every\r\ngraceful pose of a human figure, every beautiful face, every fine effect\r\nof light or shadow--he made no sign. _His_ legitimate function was\r\nfriendly guide to the stranger, and in this office he carried Caper all\r\nover the old castle, out to the long shady walk on the esplanade behind\r\nit, pointed out beautiful views over the valley; finally, showing Caper\r\nhis studio, which, as it was a large room, and his _padrona_ could\r\nimpose on his good nature, was fairly glittering with copper pans, hung\r\non the walls when not in use in the kitchen. On an easel was a painting,\r\nto be called The King of the Campagna; all that was apparent was the\r\nhead and horns of the king. Wardor had thus actually spent three mouths\r\npainting on a space not so large as your fist, while the canvas was at\r\nleast three feet by two feet and a half. But the king, a buffalo, would\r\nbe a regal figure, for the head was life itself.\r\n\r\nCaper proposed finishing a bottle of wine with Wardor, in honor of the\r\nday; so the latter piloted him up street and then down a flight of steps\r\nto a quiet wine-shop, where, sitting on a shady terrace, they could\r\ncalmly enjoy the lovely landscape spread below them, and look over the\r\ntown, over the valley, to far-away Segni high up in the Volscians. The\r\nlandlord's wife, a buxom, comely woman, in full holiday costume, brought\r\nthem a flask of cool wine and glasses, presenting them at the same time\r\nwith a couple of very large sweet apples, the largest of which was\r\nthirteen inches in circumference by actual measurement. So you see they\r\nhave apples as well as oranges in Italy; only, apples are practical, so\r\nthey are generally omitted in the poetical descriptions of the\r\nblue-skyed land.\r\n\r\nCaper and Wardor dined together in a very crowded inn, where the\r\nmaccaroni must have been cooked by the ton, to judge of the sized dish\r\nthe two artists were presented with--and which they finished! Chickens,\r\nlamb chops, salad, and two flasks of wine at last satisfied them. When\r\nthey left the table, Wardor proposed their calling on a Roman family,\r\nwho were spending the summer in the town. They found the house they\r\noccupied crowded with guests, who, having finished dinner, were busily\r\nemployed dancing to the music of two guitars and a flute; that is, the\r\nyounger part of them, while the elders applauded vociferously, entering\r\ninto the amusement with a reckless spirit of fun and good nature, which\r\npeople who have to keep shady nine tenths of the year for fear of their\r\nrulers, are very apt to indulge in the remaining tenth.\r\n\r\nElisa, the daughter of the Roman family, received Caper with hearty\r\nwelcome, chiding him for having been all summer at Segni, and yet not\r\ncoming near them, and entreating him to come to Genazzano and make them\r\na long visit. She introduced him at once to her affianced husband, a\r\nhandsome young doctor of the town, a man of sterling ability and sound\r\ncommon sense, who very soon made Caper at home, insisted on his dancing\r\nthe _Tarantella_ and _Saltarella Napolitana_ with a lively, lithe young\r\nlady, who cut our artist's heart to fiddlestrings before they had danced\r\nfive minutes together a polka--for let the truth be told, Caper never\r\ncould dance the Tarantella.\r\n\r\nWardor, in the meantime, had been led off in triumph to a side-table,\r\nand was making a very hearty second dinner; he not having force of mind\r\nenough to do like Caper and refuse a good offer! Caper had to drink a\r\nfew tumblers (not wine-glasses) of wine, and found it beneficial in\r\ndancing. It may be as well to repeat here, in order to calm all\r\napprehensions of our artist being a hard drinker, that all these wines\r\naround Rome, with few exceptions, are little stronger than mild sweet\r\ncider, and that satiety will generally arrive before inebriety. Ask any\r\nsober and rigorously correct traveller, who has ever been there, if this\r\nis not so. If he speaks from experience, he will say: 'Certainly!' 'Of\r\ncourse!' 'To be sure!' And again: 'Why not?'\r\n\r\nIt is not asserted here that the Romans of the city or surrounding\r\ncountry never get tipsy; but that it is only occasionally they have\r\nchange enough to do so; consequently, a beautiful state of sobriety is\r\nobserved by those travellers who--never observe anything.\r\n\r\nThe moon was shining over the old gate-towers of Genazzano when Caper\r\nmounted his horse, and, in company with two Segnians, rode forth from\r\nthe fifth _festa_, and over the hills through Cavi, and over the valley\r\npast Valmontone, and then up the steep road to his summer home;\r\nwondering if in far-away America they were dreaming of a man who was\r\ngoing through a course of weekly Fourth-of-July's, and how long it would\r\nbe before the world came to an end if such a state of things existed in\r\nany country where people had liberty to study geography, and were ruled\r\nby politicians instead of priests?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'May I ask your candid opinion of the great moral effect of so many\r\nholidays on an uneducated population?' inquired Caper one day of\r\nRocjean, while speaking of the festivals of the Papal States.\r\n\r\n'Certainly you may! My opinion is that the head of the state, carrying\r\nout the gigantic policy of his predecessors, believes: 'That that\r\ngovernment governs best that gives the greatest amount of fiddling to\r\nthe greatest amount of its children.''\r\n\r\n'But,' objected Caper, 'I don't see where the fiddling comes in.'\r\n\r\n'In the churches!' sententiously remarked the Sieur de Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' quoth Caper, 'I was thinking of festivals.'\r\n\r\nReader, do you think likewise, when you are with the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHT.\r\n\r\n   Life is but an outer wall\r\n     Round the realm of thought unseen;\r\n   Ah! to let the drawbridge fall\r\n   Leading to that magic hall!\r\n     Ah! to let creation in.\r\n\r\n   Kings that with the world contended,\r\n   What remains of all the splendid\r\n     Misery their hands have wrought?\r\n   Hushed and silent now the thunder\r\n   They have made the world rock under;\r\n   But the ages bow in wonder\r\n     To a thought.\r\n\r\n   Ah! the many tragic parts\r\n   That are played by human hearts\r\n     In that golden drama, fame.\r\n   These are minor actors truly,\r\n   That should not be seen unduly,\r\n   Letting idle recollection\r\n   Trifle with the play's perfection,\r\n   Letting an unwritten anguish\r\n   Make the brilliant pageant languish.\r\n     Alas for every hero's story,\r\n   That the woes which chiefly make it\r\n   Must surge from the heart, or break it,\r\n     And show the stuff that fashions glory.\r\n\r\n   Pyramids and templed wonders\r\n   At the best are wise men's blunders;\r\n   The subtle spell of thought and fancy,\r\n   It is Nature's necromancy.\r\n   In that land where all things real\r\n   Blossom into the ideal,\r\n   In that realm of hidden powers\r\n   Moving this gross world of ours,\r\n     He that would inherit fame,\r\n   Let him on the magic wall\r\n   Of some bright, ideal hall\r\n     Write his name;\r\n   He and glory then shall be\r\n   Comrades through eternity.\r\n\r\n   While the deeds of mighty kings\r\n   Sleep the sleep of meaner things,\r\n   Thoughts enclosed in words of granite\r\n   Revolutionize our planet.\r\n     And, itself a new creation,\r\n   Many an enchanted tune,\r\n   As of nightingale's in June,\r\n     Comes floating down in long vibration,\r\n   To the chorus of the hours\r\n   Lending its harmonial powers,\r\n   Or through Time's resounding arches\r\n   Playing Nature's solemn marches,\r\n   To whose beat the marshalled nations\r\n   Pass in steady generations.\r\n\r\n     But deem not the thoughts unspoken,\r\n   Silent despots of the brain,\r\n   Build their airy halls in vain,\r\n     Die and leave behind no token.\r\n       As the stars upon the ether\r\n     Play their golden monody,\r\n   Flashing on dusk-featured night\r\n   The soft miracle of light;\r\n       So upon a finer ether,\r\n   A spiritual emanation\r\n   From the whole mind of creation,\r\n     Plays the brain incessantly;\r\n   And each thought is a vibration,\r\n     Running like a poet's rhyme\r\n     Down the endless chords of time,\r\n     And on each responsive brain\r\n     Dropping in a silver rain\r\n   Of divinest inspiration.\r\n\r\n   When the whirlwind rush of war\r\n   Passes, and is heard no more,\r\n   Voices crushed beneath its din\r\n   Rise and their long reign begin;\r\n   Thoughts like burning arrows hurled\r\n   At the tyrants of the world,\r\n   Thoughts that rend like battle axes\r\n   Till wrong's giant hand relaxes,\r\n     Thoughts that open prison gates\r\n   And strike the chains of prostrate limb,\r\n     That turn the current of the fates,\r\n   Like God's commissioned cherubim\r\n   With divine authority\r\n   To proclaim creation free,\r\n   And plant in human hearts the seeds\r\n   That shall grow to noble deeds.\r\n   Ha! when genius climbs the throne\r\n   Sacred to oppression grown,\r\n     And from his seat plucks tyranny;\r\n   When, with thoughts that pierce like flame,\r\n   Songs, and every word a fame,\r\n     She crowns imperial Liberty,\r\n   Then shall the usurper, glory,\r\n   End his foul and brutal story,\r\n   And manhood evermore shall be\r\n   A synonym of liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'IT STILL MOVES.'\r\n\r\n\r\n   It still goes on. The driving rain\r\n   May chill, but light will gleam again,\r\n   It still goes on. Truth's enemy\r\n   Wins a defeat with victory.\r\n   It still goes on. Cold winter's snow\r\n   Comes that the grass may greener grow;\r\n   And Freedom's sun, whate'er befall,\r\n   Shines warm and bright behind it all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF THE REBELLION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong all the subjects of human cognizance, the least understood, and\r\ntherefore the most difficult of anticipation, are those which concern\r\nthe acts of men, as individuals or in society. Presumptuous, indeed,\r\nwould be that man who should undertake to foretell the exact results of\r\npending political or military operations, complicated as they must be by\r\ninnumerable unknown and undiscoverable contingencies, which lie hidden\r\nin the circumstances of the actual situation. The difficulty of this\r\ninvestigation does not arise, however, from the absence of fixed laws\r\ncontrolling such events, but solely from our ignorance of those laws,\r\nand the extreme complexity of the conditions in which they act. The\r\nissue of existing causes is as certain as this moment, as it will be\r\nafter it shall have become unalterable in history. No accident can\r\ndisturb or thwart it; for, in truth, there can be no such thing as\r\naccident, except in our imaginations, and by reason of our incapacity to\r\ntrace the continuous thread of inevitable sequence, or causation, which\r\nconnects together all events whatever, in their inception, through their\r\ncontinuance, and to their end. All enlightened thinkers of the present\r\nage have recognized this great truth; and yet none have been able to\r\napply to social and political affairs the sole admitted test of genuine\r\nphilosophy, the prediction of future results from known antecedents.\r\nIndeed, the wisest and most competent of political observers have always\r\nbeen the most cautious in their indulgence of the prophetic spirit, and\r\nthe most ready to acknowledge their ignorance of what the future will\r\nbring forth in the great field of political and social affairs.\r\nGasparin, in his late admirable book, 'America before Europe' (according\r\nto his American translator), has this very modest passage on this\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n     'Not feeling any vocation for the character of prophet, I shall\r\n     take care not to recount here, in advance, events that are about to\r\n     happen. I marvel at people who are so sure of their facts. The\r\n     future has not the least obscurity for them; it has much for me. I\r\n     confine myself to protesting against the positive assertions which\r\n     have contributed but too greatly to mislead the opinion of Europe.\r\n     My humbles theory is this: the defeat of the South is _probable_;\r\n     the return of the conquered South to the Union is _possible_.'\r\n\r\nBut while 'political or military vaticination' is proverbially unsafe,\r\nand therefore to be carefully avoided by all judicious inquirers, and\r\nespecially by practical statesmen, it must at the same time be admitted\r\nthat some of the general laws controlling such events are well\r\nunderstood; and whenever all the facts of a case are known and\r\nappreciated, and the laws applicable fully comprehended, then it is\r\npossible to anticipate the results of that particular combination with\r\nabsolute certainty. Other causes may interfere, and modify these\r\nresults--may accelerate of postpone them, or entirely absorb and conceal\r\nthem in the general issue of complicated affairs. Yet the particular\r\nresults themselves are not, and cannot be defeated or annulled. They are\r\nmerely transformed by a sort of 'composition and resolution' of social\r\nand political causes, exactly similar to that which takes place in\r\nmechanics, when two or more forces not concurrent in direction, impel a\r\nbody in a line altogether different from that in which either of the\r\nforces may have acted. Every physical impulse, it is said, which is\r\ninitiated anywhere on the earth, is felt to the extremities of our solar\r\nsystem--every motion of the smallest particle of matter communicating\r\nits effect, however inappreciable, to the most distant planet, and as\r\nfar beyond as the power of gravitation may extend. It is precisely so\r\nwith all social events, even those of the most insignificant character.\r\nEvery one of them has its appropriate influence, which is\r\nindestructible; and they all combine to make up the great whole of human\r\naction, the results of which at any specific period are only the\r\nnecessary and inevitable consequences of all antecedent facts.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of that most accomplished political philosopher,\r\nBurke, that 'politics ought to be adjusted not to human reasonings, but\r\nto human nature, of which reason is but a part, and by no means the\r\ngreatest part,'--the meaning of which is, simply, that the reasonings do\r\nnot comprehend, as premises, all the complicated facts which enter into\r\nany important political problem, and hence the conclusion in such cases\r\ncannot be absolutely certain, and ought not to be implicitly received.\r\nIt would be extremely difficult to explain how politics could be\r\nadjusted to human nature without the exercise of reason, which alone can\r\nregulate the process of adjustment. But we may certainly claim that, in\r\nthe lapse of nearly a century since Burke wrote, the reason has been\r\nconsiderably enlightened, and something more has been learned of human\r\nnature itself, its apparently capricious and irregular phenomena having\r\nbeen ascertained to be the subjects of systematic order, as complete as\r\nthat which prevails in all other departments of nature. The laws of\r\nsocial existence and development have been to some extent discovered,\r\nand recognized as being uniform in their operation, so that the natural\r\nand necessary course of human events may be anticipated, though as yet\r\nin a dim and imperfect way. The present age is fruitful of many wonders;\r\nbut the greatest of them all is this important truth, which has just\r\nbegun fairly to dawn upon mankind. It is already so firmly established,\r\nthat no intelligent man who is fully up with the knowledge of his epoch,\r\ncan admit the least doubt that all events, however complicated, whether\r\nsocial, political, military, or of any other kind, are controlled by\r\ngeneral laws, as uniform and certain in their operation as the laws of\r\nastronomy, of physics, or of chemistry. The complexity of conditions\r\nunder which they operate, makes these laws extremely difficult of\r\ndiscovery and of application. But the infinite combinations of\r\ninfluences which press on minds of individual members of society, and\r\nmake the acts of each one of them apparently uncertain and arbitrary,\r\nexhibit a truly wonderful degree of uniformity, when considered in their\r\noperation on the whole mass of a nation. It is by the investigation of\r\nthese wide and general effects, that the great laws of human action and\r\ndevelopment are ascertained. Their actual existence is absolutely\r\ncertain. But after all, in the present state of our knowledge, with all\r\nthe light afforded by such history as we have of the past, and with all\r\nthe experience of the present generation, the sum and substance of what\r\nwe can claim is no more than this: that some influences of a social and\r\npolitical nature may be traced to their certain results, though, from\r\nthe intricacy of all social facts, their vast extent in a great nation,\r\nand especially when international interests are concerned, and from our\r\nnecessarily imperfect acquaintance with all these varied, multiplex, and\r\npowerful conditions, we cannot always foresee what conflicting causes\r\nwill intervene to counteract, modify, and control the actual issue. It\r\nis therefore only in the most general way that anything can be said with\r\nreference to the future in social or political affairs.\r\n\r\nIn two former articles contributed to THE CONTINENTAL, we have\r\nendeavored to point out 'the causes of the rebellion,' finding them in\r\nevents and conditions contemporaneous with the birth of our\r\ninstitutions, and in the necessary antagonism of social and political\r\nprinciples naturally developed in the progress of our country, and\r\nembodied in appropriate but conflicting forms. If we have been\r\nsuccessful in designating the real causes, and tracing their operation\r\nthrough successive stages, down to the tremendous and calamitous events\r\nof the present day, we may hope to follow these causes, to some extent,\r\nin their further development, and in their necessary action on the\r\ndestiny of the nation. We can at least mark the direction of the stream\r\nof affairs as it rolls grandly before us; and while we may not know\r\nprecisely through what regions it will take its course, or by what\r\nrapids and over what cataracts it will be hurried and precipitated with\r\nfurious and destructive force, we can nevertheless pronounce with\r\nconfidence that it will finally make its way, in spite of all\r\nobstructions, to the broad and peaceful ocean of amelioration, into\r\nwhich all the currents of human action, however turbid, and filled with\r\nwrecks of human work and genius, eventually pour their inevitable\r\ntribute. We can even look through the mists of time which limit mortal\r\nvision, and catch some glimpses of the bloody current, observing where\r\nit disappears in gloom and shadow, only to come forth again in the\r\ndistance as a shining river, glistening in the sunlight of peace and\r\nprosperity, and bearing on its bosom the full-freighted ark of a mighty\r\nnation, resting from war, reunited, and reawakened to the animating\r\nsense of a glorious destiny. Though the present generation should be\r\ncompelled to struggle and labor, through its whole term of existence,\r\nwith immense sacrifice and suffering, such are the elements involved in\r\nthe contest, that nothing but good to the nation, which is surely\r\ndestined to survive, can come out of it in the end.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of our country, its origin, the peculiar organization\r\nof our institutions, and their gradual growth and development down to\r\nthe present day, seem to have been arranged and ordered for the very\r\npurpose of engendering this contest between slavery and freedom. If this\r\nstatement be too strong, we may at least assert that no better\r\nconditions for that purpose could have been devised, by human wisdom at\r\nall events, than those which existed at every stage of our progress,\r\nfrom the beginning of our existence as a people, to the culmination of\r\nthis long-smouldering strife. The germs of freedom and slavery, which we\r\nknow were planted in the infancy of our republic, found in the\r\ncircumstances surrounding them the most favorable conditions for their\r\nrespective growth and expansion. Each found ample opportunity to\r\nflourish according to its nature and necessities, modified, it may be,\r\nbut not destroyed, by the unfavorable institutions which coexisted with\r\nit. The organization of separate colonies, and afterward of separate\r\nStates, measurably independent, afforded these two irreconcilable\r\nsystems full opportunity for complete development, and rendered it\r\npossible for them to maintain, each, a distinct existence in different\r\nlocalities, and to unfold their respective natures and tendencies, with\r\ncomparatively little interference of the one with the other. Thus\r\nslavery soon became extinct in Massachusetts, and died out rather more\r\nslowly in the other Free States of the original thirteen. It flourished\r\nin Maryland and Virginia, and later, from peculiar circumstances, it\r\ngrew rank, with unexampled fecundity, in the Carolinas and Georgia. Had\r\nthe Government of the United States been consolidated, the conditions of\r\nslavery and free labor would have been wholly different; and it is\r\nreasonable to infer that the course of development of the respective\r\nsystems would have been materially modified, if not altogether changed.\r\nWe may pronounce with certainty that the institution would not have\r\nbecome extinct in the whole country as soon as it did in Massachusetts,\r\nor, indeed, in any one of the present Free States; but we cannot assert\r\nthat the converse of this proposition would have been true, and that the\r\nGovernment, as a centralized power, would have abolished slavery more\r\ncertainly, and sooner, than the most backward of the separate States may\r\nnow be expected to do, under the complex forms of our present\r\nConstitution. In a consolidated government, the power of the majority\r\nwould have been competent to effect fundamental and universal changes,\r\neven to the extent of abolishing slavery; but without the existence of\r\nseparate States, with their independent local legislation and\r\nadministrations, the gradual undermining and destruction of the old\r\nsystem would have been a process of extreme procrastination and\r\ndifficulty. It would have been a gigantic undertaking, convulsing the\r\nwhole nation whenever attempted, and yet demanding the exercise of its\r\nunited authority for its accomplishment. We should not have had the\r\neffective antagonism of the Free against the Slave States, nor the\r\ndemonstration which results from the striking contrasts between the two\r\nsystems in their effects on civilization, in all its forms of\r\nintelligence, enterprise, wealth, and improvement. Contiguous States,\r\nwith separate jurisdictions, admitted a divergence of customs, laws, and\r\ninstitutions, remarkable in its character, and fraught with momentous\r\nconsequences to the whole sisterhood. Nothing like this could have\r\noccurred under the consolidated form. It is true, according to the\r\nprinciples we have heretofore enounced as having been established by\r\nuniversal history and experience, slavery must have disappeared\r\neventually, alike in a consolidated or a federal form of government; for\r\nit is now well understood by all enlightened thinkers, that different\r\nforms of polity may either facilitate or embarrass the natural\r\ndevelopment of society, but cannot actually create or altogether destroy\r\nthe tendency to improvement. This tendency is innate in man, and\r\nindependent of all forms of government, though not wholly unaffected by\r\nthem. But in our vast country, under a centralized system, however\r\ndemocratic, it would have been far more difficult to initiate the work\r\nof emancipation, on account of the magnitude and unity of the power to\r\nbe moved, and for want of those _points d'appui_ afforded by the local\r\norganization and independent authority of the states in a confederacy.\r\nOur own experience, and the recent example of Russia, may serve to\r\nconvince us that a consolidated representative republic would probably\r\nhave been less favorable to the abolition of slavery than an imperial\r\nand despotic government. The serf-owners of Russia, had the question\r\nbeen submitted to them, would have been as little disposed to vote for\r\nthe destruction of their system, as the slave-holders of America have\r\nshown themselves inclined to submit to the voice of the majority under\r\nour republican institutions.\r\n\r\nThus, it was characteristic of our peculiar political forms, that they\r\ngave opportunity for the complete trial of each of the two plans of\r\nsocial organization which grew out of the early introduction of African\r\nslaves into the colonies. For while it seems to be clear that the\r\nfederal system was most favorable to the disappearance of slavery from\r\nthose localities where circumstances made emancipation easy and\r\nadvantageous, it is equally plain that it afforded full scope to the\r\ngrowth and influence of the system of servile labor, wherever, from\r\nclimatic conditions, it was peculiarly profitable, and otherwise adapted\r\nto the productions of the region, and to the prevailing sentiments of\r\nthe people. The confederated form of government, therefore, almost of\r\nnecessity originated the antagonism of Free States against Slave States;\r\nwhile, at the same time, and from the same cause, it enabled the\r\nopposite sections to give infinitely greater force and effect to this\r\nantagonism, than would have been possible under any other\r\nconstitutional conditions. Rebellion might possibly have been initiated\r\nwithin the bosom of a consolidated republic, and such a government might\r\nwell have been broken into two or more fragments; but this would have\r\nbeen far less likely to happen in that case than in existing\r\ncircumstances. At all events, there would have been no room for the\r\ndangerous doctrine of secession, and that plausible pretext would have\r\nbeen wanting to the incipient rebellion; nor would there have been\r\nanything equivalent to the State organizations which unfortunately\r\nafforded the ready means of immediate and most effective combination.\r\nThe inestimable advantages of our complex political system in avoiding\r\nthe necessary despotism of consolidated government, by establishing\r\nlocal legislation and administration in a number of partially\r\nindependent States, were in some measure counterbalanced by a natural\r\ntendency to discord among the parts, and a capacity for independent\r\naction in support and perpetuation of dangerous divergencies of opinion\r\nand policy. If some States could repudiate slave labor, and gradually\r\nbuild the fabric of their prosperity on the safer basis of universal\r\neducation, others could, with equal disregard of everything but their\r\nown will and fancied interests, cherish and encourage the original\r\nsystem of servile subordination and compulsory ignorance of the laboring\r\nclass, with which all the States started into their career of\r\nindependence at the commencement of the Revolution. And, unhappily, both\r\nparties to this discordant social action were unrestrained by any\r\nconstitutional obligation, or by any common authority whatever, in the\r\nindulgence, within their respective limits, of mutual hatred and\r\nvituperation, with all those numberless and exasperating injuries which\r\nno law can either notice or redress. These conflicting capabilities,\r\nwith their attendant dangers, lurked in the body of our political\r\norganization from the very beginning. They were born with it; they grew\r\nwith its growth, and strengthened with its strength, until the fatal\r\nhour when rebellion undertook the wicked work of its destruction.\r\nWhatever may be the actual issue of the struggle--whether the attempted\r\ndismemberment shall prove a success or a disastrous failure--the effect\r\nof the civil war on the character of our institutions must be\r\ncommensurate with the organic character of the causes out of which it\r\narose. So profound a disturbance of the existing social order, so vast\r\nan upheaval of the very foundations of the whole political fabric, must\r\neither rend it into fragments, and make necessary a complete\r\nreconstruction, or must cause it to settle down upon a basis firmer and\r\nmore lasting than that on which it has hitherto rested. We think it\r\nalmost absolutely certain that the latter result will be brought out in\r\nthe end. It cannot be possible that our system will be utterly\r\ndestroyed; and if, against all human probabilities, it should be\r\nmomentarily overthrown, it will rise again hereafter in greater splendor\r\nand power, by reason of the very calamity through which it will have\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nThe federative system, on this continent, will never be abandoned; it\r\nwill be far more likely to be extended much beyond its present limits,\r\neven including that immense territory which has been the theatre of its\r\norigin and glorious progress down to the present day. Its superiority\r\nover any system of consolidated power on a large scale, is beyond all\r\ndoubt, inasmuch as it provides effectually for the perfect freedom of\r\nlocal legislation and administration, and for the full participation of\r\nall the parts in the government of the whole, as to those questions\r\nwhich concern the general interests. But in this very distribution of\r\npowers always consisted the greatest difficulty and the most threatening\r\nperil; for nothing but actual experience, long continued, could adjust\r\nto each other with perfect accuracy the nicely balanced parts of this\r\ncomplicated political machinery. The principle of local independence is\r\nnaturally liable to exaggeration and abuse. The State authorities have\r\never shown a tendency to claim absolute sovereignty, and to array their\r\nwill against the authority of the Federal Government. This troublesome\r\nquestion, forever recurring in the important exigencies of our national\r\nlife, has never been definitely settled, and perhaps it could not be,\r\nexcept under the pressure of a great and critical emergency like the\r\npresent. One of the most important consequences of the rebellion will\r\ntherefore be to dispose of this question forever--to settle the\r\nboundaries of the local and general authorities, and to fix them\r\npermanently and unalterably. This might possibly have been accomplished\r\nin the appointed way, by conventions and explanatory amendments to the\r\nConstitution. But such proceedings would have been subject to all the\r\nuncertain contingencies and delays involved in partisan struggles and\r\npopular elections, and to all the imperfections of halfway measures and\r\nexpedients of compromise, born amid angry contentions, and bartered for\r\nby ambitious aspirants to place and power. By no other means could a\r\ncomplete and adequate arrangement of the difficulty be brought about so\r\neffectually as by the terrible lessons of this lamentable civil war.\r\nNothing else would have been so well calculated to clear the eyes of the\r\npeople of all illusions, and to give them an accurate insight into the\r\ncharacter and demands of the crisis. Great disasters, which destroy the\r\nfortunes of men, and disturb the prosperity of nations, never fail to\r\nawaken the human soul, and impart to it some new and important truths.\r\nThe sufferings and calamities of the war are indeed great and\r\noverwhelming; yet there will be some compensation for them all, in the\r\nsad experience we shall gain, and in the stability which will result to\r\nour sorely tried institutions in the future. Even if, against all\r\napparent possibilities, the rebellious States should finally conquer\r\ntheir independence, not only the old Government, but even the new one\r\nitself, or the batch of new ones that will spring up, will have learned\r\nthe most salutary lessons from the whole course of this sanguinary\r\nstruggle. No sundering of such ties as have always heretofore existed\r\namong these States can ever take place peaceably. Both we and our\r\nenemies will have been taught the never-to-be-forgotten truth that\r\nsecession is civil war. And we should probably have reason thereafter to\r\nadd to this sad lesson the still more solemn and portentous one, that\r\npermanent separation of these States is nothing more or less than\r\nperpetual war, with the accompaniments of large standing armies, vast\r\npublic debts, oppressive taxes, loss of liberty, and progressive decline\r\nof civilization. This state of things would, however, eventually cure\r\nitself. What is called the balance of power in Europe has been brought\r\nto its present condition of imperfect stability only through centuries\r\nof war. What bloody commotions should we experience before the\r\nconditions of stable equilibrium could be attained by the warring States\r\nof our broken Union? Each petty fragment of the discordant mass would\r\ncontain within itself the germs of precisely such a struggle as we are\r\nnow passing through. For though the Confederate Government may have\r\nostensibly recognized the actual sovereignty of the separate States\r\ncomposing it, and thereby pretended to establish the principle of\r\nsecession as a right, the war will not have reached its termination\r\nbefore that doctrine will be practically and effectually destroyed in\r\nthe very contest for its assertion. At the moment of its apparent\r\ntriumph, secession itself would expire; for so strong a government will\r\nbe indispensable to this achievement, and to the maintenance of the new\r\npower, that the very principle which presided at its birth will be\r\nsuspended and destroyed by the paramount necessities of its existence\r\nand condition. Any one of the deluded States which might in that case\r\nattempt to assert this right, would soon find, in renewed calamities,\r\nthe folly and danger of the theory on which it is founded.\r\n\r\nNothing but the hope of foreign intervention has sustained the cause of\r\nthe rebellion until the present time; and the realization of that hope\r\ncan alone keep up its vitality, and give it success in the future. The\r\ndisparity of strength and numbers in the two sections is decisive of the\r\nwhole case, if they be left to conclude the fight themselves. The\r\nquestion is one of means and men, of resources and endurance; and when\r\nwe consider the effects of the blockade, and of the probably action of\r\nthe slaves under the policy of the President, or even under the ordinary\r\nprogress of the war, no great length of time can be required to bring\r\nthe contest to an issue, even if the armies of the Union should not at\r\nonce succeed in overwhelming the enemy and taking possession of his\r\ncountry. In spite of discouraging delays and military blunders, and of\r\nall the waste of life and means which have hitherto marked the conduct\r\nof the war, the great struggle is still progressing rapidly, though\r\nsilently, in other fields than those of battle, and with other weapons\r\nthan bayonets and artillery. The sinews of war are gradually becoming\r\nshrivelled in the arm of the rebellion. Every bale of cotton locked up\r\nin the ports of the South, or hidden in its thickets and ravines, or\r\ngiven to the flames by ruthless hands of the guerillas, is so much\r\nstrength withheld from the enemy, and, in the vast aggregate, will\r\neventually be equivalent to the overthrow of his armies and the capture\r\nof his cities. The large number of slaves rushing to our lines, and the\r\nstill greater number rendered restless under restraint, and preparing to\r\nescape, may be expected, in any other year, to make even his supply of\r\nbread precarious, and still further to paralyze his strength and destroy\r\nhis means of resistance. But in addition to these accumulating\r\ndifficulties and misfortunes, our armies are everywhere moving down upon\r\nhim apparently with irresistible force, and threaten to anticipate the\r\nslower, but not less certain work of physical exhaustion. He is hard\r\npressed in Virginia, where his pretended capital is again menaced; he is\r\ndriven out of Kentucky and Missouri, and is fast receding before our\r\nvictorious forces in Tennessee. We have penetrated into Mississippi, and\r\nawait only the swelling of the waters to capture its last stronghold,\r\nVicksburg, when the great valley from Cairo to New Orleans will be in\r\nour possession, and the rebel confederacy will be sundered through its\r\nvery spine. We hold important points on the Atlantic coast and in the\r\nGulf, including the great metropolis of the South, New Orleans, and the\r\nwhole coast of Texas.\r\n\r\nBy her own energies alone, these losses can never be recovered by the\r\nSouth. Without aid from abroad, there is not the remotest possibility of\r\nprolonging the contest for another year, much less of establishing the\r\nConfederate Government on any permanent basis. And even with such\r\ninterference, supposing it to be successful, the career of the new power\r\nwould be brief, and full of trouble. It would merely exchange its\r\nposition of equality in the old Union, for one of degrading dependence\r\nand subserviency to some one of the great European Governments. The\r\nsystem of slavery could not be preserved. The demoralization has already\r\ngone too far; and no French sovereign or English administration could\r\nsafely venture to interfere in our quarrel for the purpose of upholding\r\nthat institution. In the midst of a dissolving social organization, this\r\nexhausted and fragmentary American power, galvanized into temporary\r\nvitality by the sinister aid of foreign arms, would be compelled to\r\nundertake the task of determining its boundaries, defending its\r\nfrontiers, and reorganizing its chaotic society. All this would have to\r\nbe accomplished in the presence of a still powerful adversary, jealous\r\nof her own rights, and ever ready to assert them, as opportunity would\r\npermit, in the face of all opposition. European affairs are not yet so\r\nthoroughly adjusted, and the peace of that continent established on so\r\nfirm a basis, that complications may not be anticipated at almost any\r\nmoment, which would at once free America from the disgraceful trammels\r\nof foreign intervention. It is doubtful whether such a movement from\r\nEurope could be successful, even under all the deplorable difficulties\r\nwhich now beset our country. Let any one of those Governments lay its\r\nhand on the United States, and revolution would probably hasten to rear\r\nits awful head, and so arouse the people of the continent as to shake\r\nand endanger the very thrones which now seem to be most firmly\r\nestablished. The unfriendly blow aimed at us might possibly react upon\r\nits authors, and transfer to them the misfortunes and disorders which\r\nnow afflict this country. So just a retribution is not beyond the\r\nprobabilities of the present situation in Europe, whether intervention\r\nshould come from the English aristocracy or from the French emperor. The\r\ninstincts of the people, everywhere, are on our side; their strong arms\r\nmay not be slow to vindicate the judgment they pronounce, and to follow\r\nthe sentiments and sympathies which animate their generous hearts.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all difficulties and discouragements, at home or abroad,\r\nwe firmly believe our righteous cause will eventually prevail, and the\r\nUnion be restored to even more than its former glory. The overthrow of\r\nthe power of the rebellion, the utter exhaustion of all its resources,\r\nand the frightful derangement of its entire social economy, will leave\r\nthe people of the South in a condition of helplessness which will render\r\nfurther resistance impracticable. An immediate resumption of hostilities\r\nwill be effectually prevented by the military force which will\r\nnecessarily be maintained for some time after the close of the final\r\ncampaign of the war; and before the strength of the rebellious States\r\ncan be recruited for another similar contest, new ideas will be\r\nengendered, and new sentiments of attachment to the Union may be\r\nexpected to grow up and take the place of that unnatural bitterness\r\nwhich has exasperated the war and prolonged its horrors. An inevitable\r\nchange of institutions in the South, with moderate and conciliatory\r\nmeasures on the part of the North, will serve gradually to heal the\r\ndangerous wound, self-inflicted, which has so nearly destroyed the very\r\nexistence of the fairest and most favored part of our country. In the\r\nend, a homogeneous society will extend over the whole Union, and new\r\nvigor will be infused into our political organization, by reason of its\r\nrecovery from the terrible disease by which it has been attacked and for\r\na time utterly prostrated. The alterative effects of this critical\r\ndanger overcome, and of the treatment rendered necessary, will doubtless\r\nbe one of the most important consequences of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe dogma of secession, as applied to our complex government, is\r\ninconsistent with reason, and has often been effectually refuted by\r\nargument. But sophistry, stimulated by ambition, was ever ready to renew\r\nthe controversy, and to perpetuate it in all the forms of vicious logic\r\nand plausible ratiocination. The appeal to force, however, has done\r\nsomething more than refute an argument; it has already discomfited the\r\nwhole theory, and it will not end short of the utter annihilation of the\r\nvery idea of secession as a right, and as a remedy for any evils,\r\nfancied or real, which may be suffered or imagined under our Government.\r\nAfter the close of the war, when men look back to its bloody fields and\r\nits awful sacrifices, they will be amazed at the insane folly which\r\npermitted them to consider the great American Union, with its honorable\r\nhistory, its wonderful progress, its immense power, and its proud\r\nstanding among the nations, as a mere league among petty states, to be\r\ndissolved at pleasure--as a thing to be broken into fragments, and to be\r\ndivided among ambitious aspirants, to be made the sport of domestic\r\nfaction, or of foreign rapacity and domination, changing its form and\r\nproportions with every change of popular feeling and every restless\r\nmovement of popular discontent. These fatal delusions will be made to\r\ndisappear forever, and in their place there will remain in the minds of\r\nmen the image of a majestic Government, tried in the furnace of civil\r\nwar, made solid and immovable by its grand and successful efforts to\r\nresist the threatened overthrow of its power, and becoming paternal by\r\nthe recovery of its wonted strength, which will permit and require the\r\nexercise of magnanimous forbearance even toward those misguided citizens\r\nwho have raised their traitorous hands against it. Thus, with the awe\r\nand fear which will be inspired by the tremendous energy put forth to\r\nconquer the rebellion--an energy which will appear only so much the\r\ngreater and more imposing in proportion to the difficulties and dangers\r\nmet and overcome--there will be mingled the better sentiments of love\r\nand veneration for a Government which re-establishes order, secures\r\nprotection to all civil rights, and restores, unimpaired, the liberties\r\nwhich have been disregarded for a time, in order that they might be\r\npermanently saved. To the people of the United States, the Union will be\r\nwhat it never was before, and what it never could have been without the\r\nsad experience it is undergoing now. Not that any change of form need be\r\neffected, or any violence done to the principles on which our system is\r\nfounded. The change will be solely in the spirit in which our\r\ninstitutions will be administered, arising from the altered sentiments\r\nand feelings of the whole people. They will see their Government in a\r\nnew light--a light thrown on it by the grand events of the rebellion,\r\nrevealing capabilities and powers not hitherto known to exist, and\r\nexhibiting it as the sole refuge in times of commotion and danger,\r\nstanding unmoved amidst the storm, impregnable to all its violence. In\r\nthe public recognition, by universal acquiescence, it will be considered\r\nstronger than before; and this transformation will be as much a change\r\nin the minds of the people as in the character and functions of the\r\nGovernment itself.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no good reason why the central power should acquire\r\ninordinate strength, and absorb any part of the legitimate functions of\r\nthe local governments. A more liberal interpretation of the Constitution\r\nwill somewhat extend the federal powers, and there will necessarily be\r\ngreater intensity in the exercise of acknowledged authority;\r\nnevertheless, consolidation need not be the subject of serious\r\napprehension. At the beginning of the war, when the Union was sorely\r\nbeset with the most imminent dangers, the executive power was extended\r\nfar beyond its ordinary limits; and perhaps this excess of action has\r\nbeen in some cases too long continued, and has been made to embrace\r\nobjects not legitimately within the emergency which originally justified\r\nthe departure. But even under present circumstances, there can be no\r\njust cause for alarm. There can be no real danger, until the people\r\nshall have become either overawed and silenced by terror, or careless\r\nand indifferent to the encroachments on liberty. Such is evidently very\r\nfar from being the case now. The recent elections have shown how\r\nentirely free is the expression of opinion, and how completely\r\nuntrammelled the political action of the people, who, in this instance,\r\nhave been charged with following their leaders even beyond the bounds\r\nof just opposition, into the dangerous position of giving encouragement\r\nto the enemy. Both parties, however, place their own peculiar\r\nconstruction on these popular decisions, and it is difficult to\r\ndetermine, with any accuracy, what is their actual import. We only know\r\nthat so extensive a change, affecting the position of many of the\r\nlargest States, indicates a serious dissatisfaction of some kind; though\r\nit is by no means probable that the people have intended to sanction the\r\nextreme and mischievous views of some of the candidates, who, here and\r\nthere, have secured their election. Factious divisions in the loyal\r\nStates, at this critical period, would be ruinous to the cause of the\r\nUnion. They would distract the public mind and weaken the arm of the\r\nGovernment, so as to endanger its success in the war. There is no\r\nindication of any such intention on the part of the people, whatever may\r\nbe the designs of some of those who have been successful leaders of this\r\nthreatening opposition. And the only effect which ought to follow the\r\nrecent popular demonstration is to admonish the Government, and check it\r\nin those errors which are only too natural in the mighty contest in\r\nwhich it is now engaged. The necessity for decision, vigor, and courage,\r\nis indeed apparent; and the temptation to go beyond the limits even of\r\nproper martial energy, is perhaps a sufficient excuse for those in\r\npower, whose deep sense of responsibility and honest zeal in a holy\r\ncause may sometimes lead them astray. It is not always given to men in\r\nhigh position to remain cool and calm in great emergencies, and to take\r\ncomprehensive views of the requirements of so tremendous a contest, as\r\nits aspects vary from time to time. The necessary exercise of military\r\nauthority for the preservation of the Government, however harsh and\r\nsevere it may be, will be everywhere justified, and even applauded. But\r\nthere are limits which even military license ought to respect; and when\r\nthe executive authorities go beyond the bounds of reason and necessity,\r\nthey ought themselves to be grateful to those who may have the courage\r\nto throw themselves into the breach and sternly resist the violation of\r\nright. The men in power ought to reflect that they are always liable to\r\nbe surrounded by subservient partisans, whose fears or selfish purposes\r\nmay induce them to applaud, when they ought to condemn and reprove.\r\nUnfortunately, when such parasites are listened to and rewarded, there\r\nis little hope of just and patriotic action; and this state of things\r\nleaves no channel of escape, through which the public discontent can be\r\nmanifested, except that of partisan opposition, which, in the existing\r\ncrisis, is perhaps more dangerous even than the evil it pretends to\r\ncondemn and cure. While party divisions, in the midst of dangers such as\r\nnow threaten us, are greatly to be deplored, we can, nevertheless,\r\nderive some satisfaction from results which otherwise we cannot\r\naltogether approve. All the essential principles of freedom still\r\nremain, through this great trial, undestroyed and unsuppressed by\r\nterrorism; and the popular patriotism and sound common sense, though\r\nliable to be misled at first, will eventually pronounce a just and\r\nenlightened judgment. Parasites and flatterers may shrink from the task\r\nof dissent; but the great heart of the people will find some means of\r\nexpression; and happy will be our country if their honest warnings,\r\ngiven upon 'the sober second thought,' shall be noticed and duly heeded.\r\nThere will then be no danger of any serious invasions of liberty, or of\r\nany permanent absorption of the proper constitutional functions of the\r\nStates by the Federal Government. Doubtless the central power will be,\r\nand ought to be strengthened. Its standing army will necessarily be\r\nlarger than before the rebellion; the public debt will be greatly\r\nincreased; the taxes will be heavier; and the revenue and disbursements\r\nlarger. Though its functions will remain essentially the same in nature,\r\nthey will have a broader sweep and a greater power. This enlargement of\r\nits ordinary action will naturally invest it with all the means and\r\ncapacities necessary for its own protection, and without any change of\r\nthe Constitution, it will be recognized as the true embodiment of our\r\npermanent nationality, forever paramount in its appointed sphere and\r\nappropriate functions to those of the individual States composing it.\r\nThe sum and substance of the change will be merely that the centripetal\r\nand centrifugal forces of the system will have become so completely\r\nadjusted to each other, that from this time forward the eternal\r\nequilibrium of the whole will be secured. The States will not be shorn\r\nof any power rightfully theirs, and necessary for their safety and\r\nprogress; but they will be fixed in definite orbits, with the limits of\r\ntheir authority distinctly circumscribed and established.\r\n\r\nAll social changes, sooner or later, produce their appropriate effects\r\non political institutions; and no results of the rebellion will be more\r\nprominent and important than those which will follow the inevitable\r\ndisappearance of slavery. A new system of labor will be inaugurated in\r\nthe border States, as well as in those now in rebellion. The great act\r\nof emancipation may not be immediate; nor is it by any means desirable\r\nit should be. So radical a change in the condition of millions of\r\nuneducated men would be quite as inconvenient, and, indeed, disastrous\r\nto themselves, for the time being, as to their present owners. Society\r\nitself would be thrown into the utmost confusion, and all the resources\r\nof both parties would be temporarily much diminished, if not nearly\r\ndestroyed. But, whether suddenly or gradually, this fundamental change\r\nmust take place; for it is self-evident that slavery cannot survive the\r\npresent struggle. The proclamation of the President, which is to take\r\neffect on the 1st of January next, will make emancipation more complete\r\nand speedy; but the same result would have followed the stubborn\r\nresistance of the rebels, even without that momentous act. It would be a\r\nmischievous error to believe that emancipation was originally the aim\r\nand object of the war on the part of the Union, and that the liberation\r\nof slaves, which was sure to follow its progress, is the direct act of\r\nour authorities, and not the proper consequence of the rebellion itself.\r\nA war waged for and on account of slavery--for its increase and\r\nperpetuation--necessarily, by its own nature, puts that institution at\r\nstake, and risks it on the contingency of failure. Compelled, in defence\r\nof the national unity, to carry the war into the heart of the Southern\r\nStates, the world acquiesces in that sound and necessary policy, which\r\nreleases the slaves, and sets them free forever, as fast as they come\r\nwithin the protection of our armies. The proclamation is a measure of\r\nthe same nature, intended to destroy the resources of the enemy, and to\r\nwound him in his most vulnerable point. But it can accomplish little\r\nmore than the previous policy; for the slumbering hopes of the slaves\r\nwere aroused by the first gun fired at Charleston in the beginning of\r\nthe struggle. Every movement of armies, and every bloody battle, which\r\nhas since taken place, has only served to inflame their desire for\r\nfreedom, and to fix their determination to obtain it. They have received\r\nand gladly welcomed the obscure idea, that, in some way, this sanguinary\r\nconflict was initiated for their benefit, and will not end without their\r\ncomplete emancipation. In this they are not mistaken. The final\r\nsuppression of the rebellion by military force will be the perfect\r\nconsummation of that end, accomplished through the treason and wicked\r\nfolly of the South herself. If she persevere in her stubborn resistance\r\nto the authority of the Union, the great measure of liberation will be\r\nthe result of her own blind and wilful acts of madness, and this as well\r\nthrough their natural and necessary consequences as by the terms and\r\nimport of the President's proclamation. Let slavery destroy itself. It\r\nis a just and righteous judgment that, in its atrocious effort to\r\ndestroy the nation, it should accomplish chiefly, if not solely, its own\r\nviolent and bloody death. Such retribution often attends the commission\r\nof great crimes; but it seldom happens that effects so momentous for\r\ngood flow from the infliction which seems intended only for punishment.\r\n\r\nUnder all circumstances, with or without the proclamation, slavery must\r\ndisappear soon after the suppression of the rebellion. From that time,\r\nthe States will become more and more homogeneous in their social\r\norganization. This will tend to promote unanimity among them all, and\r\ntherefore, by an obvious process, to strengthen the rightful power of\r\nthe Federal Government. The vast extent of our country, comprising so\r\nmany varieties of condition and climate, and such diversities of\r\nproduction, rising through every grade of elevation, from the Atlantic\r\nseacoast to the central mountains, and thence again descending to the\r\nshores of the Pacific, with mighty rivers running through nearly twenty\r\nparallels of latitude--this magnificent seat of republican power affords\r\nthe most unbounded resources for industry in all its employments, and\r\nfor commercial interchange of productions on the most gigantic scale.\r\nWith free labor prevailing everywhere throughout this vast and splendid\r\nregion of the temperate zone, no limits can be assigned to the national\r\nprogress. The population, wealth, activity, and intelligence of the most\r\nfavored among the Free States at the present day, can alone offer the\r\nmeasure and example of what the whole will be in the full maturity of\r\nthe new system. No European complexities of inter-state relations, no\r\noppressive restrictions on domestic commerce, no fatal divergencies of\r\nopinion and feeling, no important differences of language and\r\nliterature--none of these obstructions to harmony and progress will\r\ninterfere with the continental development and glorious destiny of our\r\nFederal Union. All that the earth yields from her teeming surface, or\r\nfrom her deep-embowelled mines; all that enterprise can accomplish with\r\nexhaustless means, the best facilities, and the most stupendous objects;\r\nand all that genius can create, when stimulated by the richest rewards\r\nand the freest opportunities for untrammelled exertion, will supply us\r\nwith the means and materials for an almost infinite variety of pursuits\r\nand occupations; but, at the same time, the essential unity of our\r\ncomplex institutions will be maintained, and their power extended and\r\nexalted by the homogeneity and uniformity of social conditions which\r\nwill prevail more and more with the lapse of years and the succession of\r\ngenerations. The blood of all kindred races will be mingled with\r\nadvantage in the veins of the cosmopolitan American; religions will be\r\nharmonized and unified by the most fraternal liberality and unbounded\r\ntoleration; and the common enlightenment of the whole people by means of\r\nuniversal education will exalt them to a condition of unexampled power\r\nand prosperity. Just as dissensions among the States tend to weaken the\r\ncentral power, their uniform and cordial cooeperation will give immense\r\nstrength to the whole. Nor will this increase of power be at all\r\ndangerous, because it will be only the legitimate consequence of the\r\ngreater progress and prosperity of the States themselves. To whatever\r\nheight the greatness of the Union may attain, it will be determined\r\nexactly by that of the States which compose it--the pyramid of its power\r\nbeing made up of theirs, which are but the enduring blocks of which the\r\nmighty structure is built.\r\n\r\nIf social unity and political strength will be promoted by the\r\nsuppression of the rebellion and the disappearance of slavery, the ties\r\nof our Union will be made stronger also by other causes. Emerging from\r\nthe war victorious, not only without being seriously injured, but with\r\neventual and speedy increase of power, the Union will command the\r\nrespect of foreign nations in a higher degree than ever before. Those\r\nEuropean nations, or rather their rulers and nobles, who now in their\r\nmalignant envy hope for the permanent dismemberment of America, will\r\nthen hail her resuscitation with a zeal which will be none the less\r\nadvantageous to us for being forced from them in spite of their present\r\nhate and detraction. If the division of our country would destroy its\r\ninfluence abroad, and subject the parts to constant intrigues and\r\ninterference from foreign powers, the restoration of the Union with even\r\nmore than its former glory will give us unexampled weight in the\r\ncounsels of mankind. Our unexpected and astounding exhibition of\r\nmilitary power, our thorough command of the American continent, and its\r\nimmense resources, hardly yet begun to be developed, and the unlimited\r\nprosperity which the future will assuredly bring us, cannot fail to\r\nstrike the minds of European thinkers, and to awaken deep interest among\r\nthe European people. The stream of immigration, interrupted by the war,\r\nwill be renewed with at least its former fulness, and will keep pace\r\nwith the demands of our country for labor and population. The South may\r\nthen be expected to receive her full share of this increase by people\r\nfrom abroad, and will then commence that process of condensing and\r\npermanently fixing her population, without which she can never attain\r\nany high position in the scale of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe large public debt destined to be incurred, may be expected to have\r\nsome influence in preventing immigration and improvement; but unless the\r\nwar shall unfortunately linger far beyond the period at which its end is\r\nnow anticipated, the liabilities of the Government will not be so great\r\nas to prevent the speedy return of our usual prosperity. A different and\r\nfar better system of taxation will be required--one more favorable to\r\ncommerce and at the same time equally productive, or at least\r\nsufficiently so to meet all our liabilities and provide for the\r\nextinguishment of the debt within a reasonable time. One of the\r\nadvantages attending this great debt and modifying its certain evils and\r\nburdens, will be the necessity of devising a stable revenue system,\r\nintended solely to provide means for sustaining the Government and\r\nmeeting the public obligations. Periodical changes, often depending on\r\nparty ascendency and popular elections, have hitherto marked the\r\nfinancial policy of our Government. So long as the sources of revenue\r\nwere superabundant and the demands of the Treasury very moderate, we\r\ncould well afford to make experiments, and even to depart from the true\r\nprinciples of taxation, or at least to do so without any very serious or\r\nruinous consequences. Now, however, when the public expenditure is about\r\nto be vastly increased, and when it will be for the first time really\r\nfelt by the people, it will become the first duty of our rulers to study\r\nthe extent and true character of our resources, and to adjust the\r\nburdens of taxation, with all practicable fairness, to the respective\r\ncapacities of all classes and interests. We may expect to have a system\r\nstable and permanent in its principles, if not in its details; and the\r\nbasis of this system will be a wise arrangement of duties on imports,\r\nwhich must, from various reasons, ever form the great bulk of our taxes.\r\n\r\nIt is not an American maxim that a great public debt is a public\r\nblessing; nor is it likely that an educated and eminently practical\r\npeople like ours will ever accept that mischievous paradox. Yet if it\r\nbe desirable that our large public debt should be widely scattered among\r\nthe people, so that every man may be directly interested in maintaining\r\nthe public credit and the stability of the Government, the present\r\nsystem, now but imperfectly adapted to that object, might easily be made\r\nto accomplish it fully. If the Treasury notes recently issued were the\r\nonly paper circulation in the country--that is to say, if the banks were\r\nprohibited, by taxation or otherwise, from making any issues of their\r\nown--the Government might increase their amount to at least five hundred\r\nmillions, with even less than the present depreciation, and would thus\r\nenjoy the benefit of a loan to that amount without the payment of any\r\ninterest. As it is now, the banks get the advantage of a great part of\r\nthis extensive loan, and at the same time perform a function which\r\nproperly belongs to the Government--that of furnishing a currency for\r\nthe people. By the proposed system, the entire community would be\r\ninterested in this part of the public debt, and would doubtless find the\r\ncirculating medium much safer and better than that now manufactured by\r\nthe numberless banks chartered by the States. The issue of these notes\r\nby State institutions was always an evasion of that clause of the\r\nConstitution which prohibits the States from issuing bills of credit,\r\nand is plainly against the spirit and intention of the instrument. If\r\nour public debt should, in this way, eventually drive all bank notes out\r\nof circulation and banish them forever, it will have accomplished a\r\nvaluable work in restoring the true construction of the Constitution,\r\nand, in this particular at least, will have proved a public blessing. It\r\nwill be very easy, in the course of time, to redeem the Treasury notes,\r\nand gradually to substitute for them a species of national paper based\r\non actual deposits, which will afford all the conveniences with none of\r\nthe dangers of the present system, by which the local banks virtually\r\nestablish the currency of the country, flooding it with all varieties of\r\npaper, without uniformity of value, with no adequate control or\r\nregulation of its quantity, thus producing periodical convulsions and\r\nrobbing the people of their hard-earned savings.\r\n\r\nIf the rebellion, by the burdens which it leaves behind, shall bring\r\nabout these two results--the adoption of a wise and permanent system of\r\nrevenue, and the establishment of a sound currency by the prohibition of\r\nall bank circulation--it will have accomplished ends only inferior in\r\nimportance to the two primary consequences, the overthrow of the\r\nprinciple of secession and the destruction of slavery. Thus, this\r\ntremendous convulsion would bring out of the chaos a new order in the\r\npolitical world, by annihilating secession, and by perpetuating the\r\nUnion and banishing all fear of its dissolution; in the social, by\r\nsubstituting free men for slaves; in the financial, by a permanent\r\nadjustment of tariffs and taxation; and in the commercial, by the\r\nprohibition of bank paper and the substitution of a safe and uniform\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'I;' OR, SUMMER IN THE CITY.'\r\n\r\n     'I love the sweet security of streets.'--CHARLES LAMB.\r\n\r\n\r\n'I,' my charming friend, do not fully sympathize with the late Mr.\r\nLamb's statement, as quoted above; which statement I always have\r\nbelieved partially owed its origin to its very tempting alliterative\r\nrobe.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I do _not_ particularly like the 'sweet security of\r\nstreets,' but vastly prefer 'a boundless contiguity of shade,'\r\nespecially during the present month--August--or\r\n\r\n   'A life on the ocean wave.'\r\n\r\nI do not mean a permanent residence there--that would be liable to be\r\ndamp and unhealthy, and altogether too insecure to be 'sweet;'--but when\r\nI say a 'life on the ocean wave,' it is merely my poetical license for a\r\ncottage at Newport. (I wish, indeed, that I had any _but_ a poetical one\r\nfor such a possession!)\r\n\r\nBut what folly for me to talk of a cottage there! when my limited income\r\ndoes not even admit of a cot in the cheapest of seaside inns.\r\n\r\nGentle reader! shrink not from me when, in addition to this melancholy\r\nconfidence, I also announce to you that I live in town--in 'Boston\r\ntown,' to be accurate--during August! I belong to the 'lower orders of\r\nsociety;' and my only Newport is the Public Garden, or a walk to\r\nLongwood, and, when I am _very_ affluent, a horse-car drive to Savin\r\nhill, where a teaspoonful of sea view is administered to the humble\r\nwayfarer.\r\n\r\nYes! I positively did exist in the city, not only through the month of\r\nAugust, but all the summer days of all the summer months. I mention\r\n_August_ in the city, because I know that has a peculiarly God-forgotten\r\nand forsaken sound.\r\n\r\nI should soon cease to exist anywhere, I fancy, if I did _not_ stay in\r\ntown, for (horror No. 2!) I work at a trade in order to earn my daily\r\nbread and coffee! What my particular trade is, I am not going to\r\ndivulge--that shall remain a delicious mystery (the only delicious thing\r\nabout it); only this much I will confide: I do not, _a la_ Mr. Frederick\r\nAltamont, 'sweep the crossing.' Unhappy Altamont! he did not appreciate\r\nthe sweet security of streets.\r\n\r\n'Poor thing!' you exclaim, 'work at a trade?'\r\n\r\nRest tranquil, fair one; the phrase doubtless sounds harshly to your\r\ndelicate, aristocratic ears. (Oh, what lovely earrings!) Be tranquil! I\r\ndo not work _very_ hard; my hands are perhaps so audacious as to be as\r\nsmall, as white, and as soft as your own.\r\n\r\nBut I have to 'work reg'lar,' every week day of all the months of every\r\nyear; and when the time arrives for me to go into the country, I shall\r\nnot return again to Boston; for I shall go to a land from whence no\r\ntraveller returns. _Apropos_ of this rather dismal topic: A queer cousin\r\nof mine, 'Sans Souci,' who has a taste for 'morbid anatomy,' was the\r\nother day enjoying himself with Mr. Smith, the cheerful sexton of the\r\nKing's Chapel. These two were 'down among the dead men,' under the\r\nchurch, when Mr. Smith apologized for leaving my cousin, on the plea\r\nthat he had a previous engagement to take a young gentleman into the\r\ncountry--a delicate way of stating that he was about to convey a body\r\nout to Mount Auburn!\r\n\r\nSome fine day, I too shall take a drive with some Mr. Smith--not, of\r\ncourse, _the_ S. C. Smith, for, as I have mentioned, 'I' belong to the\r\n'lower orders.'\r\n\r\nNow let me tell you of _my_ Newport, and of what mitigations there are\r\nfor the poor wretches who pass their summer in the city, to whom the\r\njoys of Sharon, Saratoga, the Hudson, and of Lake George are as\r\nimpossible as though these delightful resorts were in other planets.\r\nPerhaps, like Mr. T. A.'s 'good Americans,' they have a vague hope that\r\nwhen they die they can visit these famous places! For myself, I long ago\r\nmade out my 'visiting list.' Oh, bless you! as soon as I shall be 'out\r\nof the body,' I shall start on the most delightful tour (no bother about\r\nthe luggage, checks, or couriers!); it will be years and years before I\r\nfairly 'settle down' in that\r\n\r\n   'bright particular star'\r\n\r\nI have selected for my permanent residence. Yes! you horrible madame!\r\noh, you horrible madame, who express your fears that I shall 'never be\r\nsettled,' speaking of me as if I were the coffee in your\r\ncoffee-pot--(only, of course, such a well-regulated dame's coffee is\r\nnever anything but _quite_ clear and settled)--yes, to relieve your\r\npoor, narrow mind, I can bid you hope that in another and pleasanter\r\nworld I fully expect to be--'settled.' I tell you this beforehand, for I\r\nam very sure that you won't go to the same planet, and therefore will\r\nnever have the satisfaction of knowing the fact from personal\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nBut what am I about? Building castles in the skies! Mr. Editor Leland,\r\nas usual, protests against my sad lack of con-cen-tra-tion! Let us\r\nconcentrate, therefore, my beloved hearers! With or without sugar? Oh, I\r\nwas beginning to tell you about Newport--_my_ Newport, the Public Garden\r\nof Boston, _alias_ Hub-opolis--which you, poor things! belonging to the\r\n'higher orders' and living on Arlington, Berkely, Clarendon, and the\r\nDuke of Devonshire streets, never have a chance to see in its Augustan\r\npomp and glory. In fact, till this summer, its 'pomp and glory' were\r\nquite concealed by dust and ashes; but now, thanks to the 'City\r\nFathers,' it is\r\n\r\n   'Ye land of flowers.'\r\n\r\nLet me describe it to you; for though your dwellings are directly\r\nopposite, yet, custom compelling you to leave them before the flower\r\nseason begins, you in reality know less of it than I do, living in a\r\nstreet whose name must not be mentioned to ears polite. 'Tis far from\r\nthe Beacon 'haunts of men,' far from the Garden, and uncommonly far from\r\nthe Common. I rise betimes on these summer mornings, and, before I go to\r\nmy work, shaking off the dust of my obscure street, I enter your sacred\r\nprecincts, oh, F. F. B.'s! Bless you, it can do you no harm, for even\r\nyour boudoirs do not look out at me; their eyes are shuttered to all\r\nsuch vulgar sights. It was impertinent, but this morning I pitied you\r\n(_you!_) that you could not see the wondrous beauty of the--_city in\r\nAugust!_\r\n\r\nThe morning was gloriously beautiful: it might have been the sister to\r\nthat one born so long ago, on which its Creator looked, and said that it\r\nwas 'good.' I actually forgot that I had no position; I imagined I had,\r\nfor the very brightest beauty filled my soul--I saw angels ascending and\r\ndescending (not Beacon street, as in the winter season) the charmed air\r\naround me. 'Ye land of flowers,' indeed! All of them mine--mine, though\r\nI must not pluck the humblest one. In truth, I had no desire to do so.\r\nWhy should I take the lovely creatures from their beautiful home, to the\r\nclose, dull room where I must sit all the bright day? Let me rather\r\nthink of them fresh, free, and happy there, as I often think of a\r\ngolden-haired child in heaven; one so dear to my heart of hearts, I\r\nbless God that I _can_ think of her there with the angels who stand\r\nnearest the Throne--and far, far away the weary paths that I must tread\r\nto the end. But if heaven had not wanted another cherub, and she had\r\nbeen left to be the flower of my life, think you I could have seen her\r\nbeauty wither in the dull room to which I must hasten in an hour? No! a\r\nthousand times no! I should leave her with her sisters in the garden\r\nhere, with her cousins, the birds and butterflies, while I worked for\r\nboth. Lilies must neither 'toil nor spin.' How idly I am dreaming! She\r\nis far away from this worky-day world; I shall never see her again, but\r\nin dreams, as now! Little sister! with starry eyes, and soft curls\r\nclustering around the sweet infant face; so many nights the same bright\r\nvision--with the same wreath which I myself placed on her head, of May's\r\npale flowers, and she the palest. Only lilies of the valley, I remember,\r\nseemed fitting for my darling's brow, or to grow on\r\n\r\n\r\nANNIE'S GRAVE.\r\n\r\n   Bright Roses, wither on the spray!\r\n     Your sweetness mocks the doom\r\n   Of her whose cheeks, so pale to-day,\r\n     Were rivals of your bloom.\r\n\r\n   Sweet Violets, I charge ye, fade!\r\n     Wear not those robes of blue,\r\n   For eyes are closed which Nature made\r\n     Of a more lovely hue.\r\n\r\n   Pale Lilies, sad and drooping low,\r\n     With perfume like her breath,\r\n   On Annie's grave alone shall grow,\r\n     _Fair flower, plucked by Death_.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Call it an affectation, if you will, but I\r\n   never take a flower from its home without\r\n   a slight twinge of pain. I _know_ it\r\n   suffers! However, I have no scruples in\r\n   accepting flowers after they are plucked\r\n   by others. So pray do not hesitate\r\n   about sending me that superb bouquet,\r\n   which you intended to send me _to-morrow_!\r\n   Have you never observed the\r\n   brutal habit which 'some persons'\r\n   have, of recklessly attacking shrubs\r\n   and flowers, as though they were rank\r\n   weeds (or secessionists), and, without\r\n   in the least enjoying their spoils, tossing\r\n   their quivering, trembling victims\r\n   aside, before they are dead or even\r\n   withered? Such are not worthy of\r\n   flowers, excepting French flowers,\r\n   which are not supposed to suffer. Oh,\r\n   my countrywomen! would that they\r\n   _did_ suffer a little from our neglect.\r\n\r\n   Do you know who Lacoontola is?\r\n   I have made her acquaintance this\r\n   summer, and find it one of the compensations\r\n   for passing the summer in\r\n   town.\r\n\r\n   She is to be found at the City\r\n   Library--'Lacoontola, or, The Fatal\r\n   Ring,' translated from the Sanscrit.\r\n   Go there for her, I pray you, and you\r\n   will admire with me the exquisite description\r\n   of her tenderness to these\r\n   'flower people,' as Mrs. Mann calls them.\r\n\r\n   But, pardon! You who belong to the\r\n   'highest orders' must be already intimate\r\n   with Mlle. Lacoontola, for she is\r\n   highly connected: her papa was a king\r\n   (quite equal in position to Mr. Abe\r\n   Lincoln); her mamma, I regret to\r\n   state, though a very charming person,\r\n   was an actress or goddess, or something\r\n   in that line. Lacoontola, however, in\r\n   spite of her papa's indiscretion, married\r\n   a prince, and was, in fact, perfectly\r\n   genteel and quite religious. Before\r\n   her marriage, she appears to have\r\n   'lived in the woods' the year round;\r\n   her wardrobe being 'turu-lural.' She\r\n   used to wear the 'dearest' little zouave\r\n   of the 'tender bark' of the 'Aurora\r\n   tree.'\r\n\r\n   'Rich and rare were the gems she wore,'\r\n\r\nfor her bracelets were the 'long perfumed stems of the waterlilies!' and\r\nin her hair the lotus flower, in place of a lace _barbe_!\r\n\r\nThere is a very beautiful description of Lacoontola's love and tender\r\ntreatment of all the flowers and shrubs--her companions--and of all\r\n_dumb_ animals. (_On dit_ that the prince was henpecked by _Mrs._ L.!)\r\n\r\nThis wild girl had a human love for the forest flowers; she says to\r\nthee, Madhari Creeper: 'Oh, most radiant of twining plants, receive my\r\nembraces, and return them with thy flexible arms: from this day, though\r\nat a distance, I shall forever be thine.' How unconventional! I fancy\r\nMlle. L. must have inherited this style of conversation from her mamma;\r\nall very well, when confined to flowers and 'creeping' things; but one\r\nday, as she was out walking, she met 'by chance--the usual way,' Prince\r\nDashuranti, and our young lady said pretty much the same sort of thing\r\nto him as to the 'Creeper,' falling violently in love with him at first\r\nsight. It struck H. R. H. as a little peculiar--rather extraordinary in\r\na well-bred miss; but as it was leap year, and learning that she was the\r\nonly child, and would inherit all of papa's immense fortune, he married\r\nher 'off-hand;'--well, that very afternoon at four o'clock--by the\r\nsundial. You see it didn't take so long 'in those days,' to get the\r\ntrousseau, and all 'the things' in readiness. Papa raised his\r\nsceptre-wand, and mumbled some infernal gibberish--and, lo! all the\r\ntrees and shrubs blossomed instanter, with the 'sweetest loves' of\r\nthings trimmed with 'real point;'--well, with something just as\r\ndelicious to the soul of a young (or middle-aged) maiden on the eve of\r\nmatrimony. There was no necessity, either, for an order to Bigelow\r\nBros., Boston--since, if Dushuranti wished to present her with a pair of\r\nbracelets on her wedding day, he had but to 'push out' on the pond, and\r\nget some waterlilies!\r\n\r\nThe 'gibberish' in which the old gentleman is said to have invoked the\r\nbackwoods 'Chandlers' and 'Hoveys,' I will obligingly translate for you,\r\nas possibly you may not be able to read it in the original Sanscrit! Oh!\r\ndon't tell _me_ that you 'won't trouble me,' and all that. I _will_ bore\r\nyou, and nobody can save you!\r\n\r\n'Hear, O ye trees of this hallowed forest, hear and proclaim that\r\nLacoontola is going to the palace of her wedded lord. She who drank not,\r\nthough thirsty, before you were watered; she who cropped not, through\r\naffection for you, one of your fresh leaves, though she would have been\r\npleased with such an ornament for her locks; she whose chief delight was\r\nin the season when your branches are sprayed with flowers,' &c., &c.\r\nShould you like a photograph of this charming person, Lacoontola, taken\r\nby Black & Batchelder, at the time of her marriage, 'Williams & Everett'\r\ncan oblige you. You will perceive, from her picture, that she is not too\r\nfond of dress, or a 'slave to fashion.'\r\n\r\n'Rappacini's daughter' (one of Hawthorne's Mosses) was a morbid\r\n'Lacoontola.' She loved her flowers,--'not wisely, but too well!' She\r\nbecame a sort of exterminatrix--a strychninus young person! From the\r\npoisonous _arsenic_ embraces of her garden loves, she acquired, you\r\nremember, her fatal, glowing beauty--beauty altogether 'too rich for\r\nuse, for earth too dear,' since it consigned the 'party' ensnared by it\r\nto the silent tomb!\r\n\r\n'Rappacini's daughter,' indeed! Lovely girl-woman, seated at yonder bay\r\nwindow (to be accurate, the 'Back Bay window'!), playing with your ten\r\ncherub children; your tropical 'midsummer-night's-dream' beauty recalls\r\nBeatrice (Hawthorne's Beatrice I mean). How many have _you_ slain, my\r\nlove? And Madame Grundy echoes: 'Their name is legion!' 'A quick\r\nbrunette, well moulded, falcon-eyed'! As in the description of Beatrice,\r\none is reminded 'of all rich and intense colors'--the purple-black hair,\r\nthe crimson cheek, the scarlet lips. And the eyes? ah! gazing into those\r\nwonderful eyes, one forgets the color they wear, in trying to interpret\r\ntheir language! 'Cleopatra!' who would not be an Antony for thee? _I\r\nwould not!_\r\n\r\nI have unconsciously interrupted a lady in her morning bath!--the 'stone\r\nlady' of the fountain. She seems to be looking for her Turkish towel,\r\njudging from her anxious expression! Rather a good-looking person--quite\r\npretty, if only she would go to Summer street and purchase a black silk.\r\nDress, I fancy, would improve 'her style of beauty.' Poor thing! it's\r\nrather a long walk to take, _a la_ 'Lacoontola'! I must lend her my\r\nwaterproof, only she appears already to be water-proved! How she _must_\r\nenvy the coloring and the clothes of my beautiful dame of the window!\r\n\r\nBut my hour is passing away! '_Resurgam_'--as the sun incorrectly\r\nremarked this morning--and go on my way, rejoicing to say 'bon jour' to\r\nall my dear flower friends. And first, the 'Asters'--they always were\r\nrich, you know, from 'John Jacob' down; but this summer, _malgre_ taxes\r\nand curtailment of incomes and go-comes, the family appear in\r\nunprecedented splendor. What gorgeous Organdies! all quilled in the\r\nfashion--but not by Madame Peinot: her cunning right hand, with all its\r\ncunning, ne'er quilled so exquisitely. Those graceful, fragile Petunias\r\n(what a family of sisters!), in their delicate _glaze_ silks (ratherish\r\n_decollete!_), and the Superbia, Empress 'Gladiolus,' in brocade of such\r\ndaring hues, may call the Asters 'stiff and prudish' in their quilled\r\nmuslins; but, what say the Asters in return? Ah! what do they _not_ say?\r\n\r\nThe Verbenas seem fairly delirious this morning, as though the\r\nconsciousness of their own beauty made them run wildly from their beds\r\ninto the paths, to say to the passers-by, with their bright little\r\nfaces:\r\n\r\n'See! am I not charming?'\r\n\r\nWell, you _are_ pretty--_very_ pretty; but I care not for you as for\r\nyour plainer stepsister, the 'sweet-scented Verbena.' She has a pale,\r\nsad face; but she has a _soul_, which you have not, poor things! for\r\nperfume is the soul of 'flower people.'\r\n\r\nBut, who wants gold? Lives there a man with purse so full who does _not_\r\nwant it? Well, then, snatch that heap of sunshine, that dazzling\r\nCoreopsis, and be off before the policeman turns into this path. Ah, ye\r\nDaylilies! You break my heart with your moonlight faces. Standing apart\r\nfrom the world-flowers, like novices in their white veils, who offer the\r\nincense of their beauty to Heaven--oh! give a little of your perfume to\r\na poor un-otto-of-rosed mortal--breathe on me, and I can laugh at the\r\ncostly 'Wood Violet,' 'Eglantine,' and 'Rose,' with which Harris &\r\nChapman scent their patronesses--to be dollared in return!\r\n\r\nDaylilies, your perfume is too subtle, too vague, to be coined or\r\n'cabined, cribbed, confined' in scent bottles.\r\n\r\nAh! the flowering Mosses; they seem to be having one eternal picnic with\r\nthe Myrtles and Verbenas, playing forever that dear-to-children game of\r\n'Tag'! Some are arrayed in Solferino velvets, rather heavy for this warm\r\nday! Prettier these, in soft rose-colored robes, and this, in a\r\n\r\n   'Oh! call me fair, not pale'--\r\n\r\nwell, _almost_ pale robe, the very climax of delicacy: the faintest\r\nthought of rose color alone prevents one from calling it lily-white. I\r\nam reminded of you, O flower-named friend! Vision of loveliness! which\r\nhas in a few never-to-be-forgotten days oasised my Sahara life. Now I\r\nhave reached the pond--_my_ Lake George! It is fresh and breezy this\r\nmorning, after last night's thunder-shower, and the mimic waves are\r\nimpatiently breaking over the thus-far-shalt-thou-go stone. I cannot\r\nblame them for rushing over that green sward to give a morning kiss to\r\nthe blushing 'Forget-me-nots,' and just say to them, 'Remember _me_!'\r\n\r\nYes; I have a few crumbs of time left to sit in the rustic arbor and\r\ngive one lingering look behind, that I may carry a picture with me when\r\nI go to my work.\r\n\r\nHow fortunate it is for one that these flowers are Londoners in their\r\nhabits, and pass August in the city! I can go to their receptions daily,\r\nif I choose; they are always at home to the poorest, the most\r\nunfashionable; they keep no 'visiting book' in their hall.\r\n\r\nHark! the bell rings seven o'clock. There is a 'knocking at the gate'\r\nof my fairy land; it warns me that I must be on my Washington-street\r\nway, to earn my bread.\r\n\r\n_Bien!_ my first meal of to-day has been satisfactory. Heaven hath sent\r\nme all manner of manna for breakfast--and for lunch? a banana. Yes; on\r\nmy way 'down town' I shall pass the Studio Building, where the B.'s\r\nlive; I will buy one of them, but shall also steal--many glances at the\r\nHamburg grapes, those peachiest of peaches, bombastic blackberries, and,\r\nO Pomona! _such_ pears.\r\n\r\nI escape! purse uninjured, only bananared. I reach Winter street, where\r\nI must turn my back on the Common pleasures of Boston life--but yet, one\r\nglance at that seductive window of the corner store, which, indeed, is\r\nnearly all window. Flowers are there, of course,--flowers from January\r\nto January; any poor devil can have a temporary conservatory at that\r\nwindow, 'all for nothing;' I ought to pay a yearly tax for the pleasure\r\nI steal in that way. The woman who carries my portmonnaie, only permits\r\nme to open it for the 'necessaries' of life: the luxuries of hot-house\r\ngrapes and flowers ever wear for me that fatal label: 'Touch not, taste\r\nnot.' Bread and cologne are, of course, the first necessities of life;\r\nin rolls and religion I am a Parkerite; in cologne, I swear by 'Mrs.\r\nTaylor'! Beacon street, I beg that you won't faint at this horrible\r\ndisclosure!\r\n\r\nWho _is_ 'Mrs. Taylor'? and echo answers, 'We haven't the faintest odor\r\nof an idea!' None know her but to praise, wherever she may be. With\r\nSancho Panza we say, 'Blessings on the man who invented Mrs. Taylor at\r\nseventy-five cents _per_--the hock bottle. I catch a glimpse of her long\r\nneck, stretching up among the roses and Geraniums: my cologne nature\r\ncan't resist that sight! I obey the syren's call, though it will leave\r\nme a beggar, but with Mrs. T. in my chaste-embrace.\r\n\r\n'The man I work for' treats me, for some reason, with 'distinguished\r\nconsideration.' Though I may sometimes be a little after the required\r\nhour, it's all right; and though he's a Yankee, no questions are asked!\r\nI still have a precious quarter remaining--not of a dollar, but of time.\r\nI have in my purse one postage stamp; but that will warrant a visit to\r\nLoring's! One must have books as well as bread and cologne. O LORING!\r\nwhat an institution art thou! Name dear to all classes, from Madame\r\n----, who steps from her carriage, to the pretty shop-girl, who always\r\nwants Mrs. Southworth's last--and worst--novel.\r\n\r\nWho, indeed, 'so poor' as not 'to do _him_ reverence,' and find two\r\ncents _per_ day, when for that sublimely small sum one can get a\r\ncompanion for any and every mood,\r\n\r\n   'Grave to gay, from lively to severe?'\r\n\r\nBut will 'LORING'S' be open at this early dawn? 'Open,' indeed! one does\r\nnot catch _him_ napping; yes, open and so inviting! A literary public\r\ngarden so fresh and clean, as\r\n\r\n   'Just washed in a shower.'\r\n\r\nIn the rear, behind the desk, one is always sure of finding at least\r\n_two roses_, and _on_ the desk a vase of flowers is certainly to be\r\nseen--the offering of some one of the hundreds of admirers who go to\r\nLoring's, nominally for some entertaining book--and they always find\r\none!\r\n\r\n'What book did you say, miss?' asks Fleur de Marie. ('Where _does_ she\r\nget those lilies and roses? I saw none like them in the garden this\r\nmorning. Ah! many of the dames who enter here from their carriages would\r\nalso like to ask my question--since they do not seem to find them even\r\nat Newport!) 'If you please, _what_ book?' again inquire the Roses.\r\n\r\n'Oh!' I answer, 'I was looking, and forgot what I came for; is 'Out of\r\nhis Head' _in_ yet?'\r\n\r\nThe fair librarian evidently thinks I am out of mine. Ah! would that I\r\nwere, and out of my whole body; but no! ingrate that I am, to-day I\r\nshould be content--simply _to be_; even a cabbage ought to be happy in\r\nsuch perfect summer weather. T. B. Aldrich _is_ in--as much as he ever\r\nis supposed to be; but I recall now that I read his sketchy book the\r\nother night, while I was brushing my hair, giving it a sort of 'good\r\ntime generally,' letting it run wild a little before going to sleep. I\r\nread 'Pierre Antoine's Date Tree' quite through, and liked--the _last\r\npart_ very much indeed. There are some people whom I am always very glad\r\nto have visit me, because I feel so 'dreadful glad' when they go away.\r\nSo, also, it compensates one to read certain books for the sake of the\r\ndelicious sensation one experiences on finishing them! What a pile of\r\n'_Les Miserables_,' Fantine? _C'est assez miserable._ The 'Hunchback' is\r\nthe least deformed of Hugo's offspring; but I read _that_ last Sunday\r\nmorn--no; I mean last Saturday evening; for I went to church on Tremont\r\nstreet, last Sunday. What's this? it looks as tempting as a banana, and\r\nis not unlike one in color. 'Melibaeus in London,' in the summer, too:\r\ngood! I'll take that, it shall 'assist' the banana at my lunch. I hurry\r\nout of this 'little heaven,' murmuring, as I depart: 'LORING, live\r\nforever!'\r\n\r\nLady Macbeth undoubtedly alluded to you when she says:\r\n\r\n   'We _fail_? there's no such word as fail!'\r\n\r\nI believe the Macbeths, and, in fact, everybody but Loring, has failed\r\nduring the war times. McClellan certainly has--not succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe police (those gentlemen of elegant leisure) do not even suspect how\r\nmuch I have stolen, and what treasures I am carrying off before nine\r\no'clock A. M.! All the splendors of the early morning are mine; they\r\nwill gild the dull grey of my working hours. What a stock of perfumes\r\nstolen from the garden! they will sweeten the 'business air' of\r\nWashington street. The fountain's glistening spray will sprinkle the\r\ndusty walk to 'the shop.'\r\n\r\nI have not yet told you of the kisses taken--not from Fera's, but from\r\nthe cherry-ripe lips of two lovely children, with whom I formed an\r\nintimacy in the garden by the pond; they were 'sailing' their mimic\r\nboats there. I almost wished\r\n\r\n   'I were a boy again,'\r\n\r\nand had a boat to sail! These children had such a brave and haughty\r\nbeauty, and their dress being of purple and fine linen, I supposed their\r\nname must be Berkeley or Clarendon, but was grieved to learn from the\r\nartless darlings that it was Muggins! However, their kisses were\r\nunexceptionable, whatever their origin may have been.\r\n\r\nBut what a 'heap' of Beauty I stole in my return walk through\r\nBeaconstreet mall! No wonder those magnificent elms are in love with\r\neach other, and embrace over the people's heads! When I come into my\r\nfortune, I intend, early the next morning, before breakfast, to make the\r\nfirst use of my 'funds' in purchasing Mr. George Ticknor's house. (Of\r\ncourse, he will not object.) I shall then laugh at the mill-dam\r\nprincipalities and powers when I look from my library windows down that\r\nlong vista of noble trees. Come and see me when I am settled there! You\r\nshall have a warm welcome in winter, and a cool one in summer. And now,\r\nfare thee well, whoever thou art, who hast kindly walked with me to the\r\ndoor of--my 'place of business.' I will not ask you to enter there. I\r\ncan worry through the day: unseen companions go with me to soothe and\r\ncheer; so do not pity me that I am what I am--'nobody,' living\r\n'nowhere.' You have seen that the Angel of Beauty disdains not to appear\r\nin my humble path--and sometimes hovers so near, I can almost touch her\r\nwings!\r\n\r\nAnd so God be w'ye! Little joys to you are great joys to me. There be\r\nthose above you, 'kinges and princes and greate emperours,' to whom your\r\nluxuries and badges would seem as little as mine are to you. When you\r\nare beautiful, you adorn my street; when you are unlovely, I--pass you\r\nby. _Bon jour la compagnie!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IVY.\r\n\r\n   'Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.\r\n   Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.\r\n   So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle\r\n   Gently entwist,--the female Ivy so\r\n   Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.\r\n   Oh, how I love thee; how I dote on thee!'\r\n\r\n   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iv., scene 1.\r\n\r\n     'The bearers of the thyrsus (bound with Ivy) are many, but the\r\n     Bacchantae are few.'--_Orphic saying._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, among plants, the Rose is unmistakably feminine, from the delicate\r\ncomplexion of its flower, the Ivy is not less so from the tender\r\nsentiment of attachment expressed by its whole form and life. In her\r\ninfinite array of poetic symbols, Nature has given us nothing so\r\nexquisitely typical of all that is best in woman, as that which may be\r\nfound in the graceful curves and in the firm strength of this vine. In\r\nyouth and beauty, she clings to the husband tree or parental wall for\r\nsupport, and, like a wife or daughter, conceals defects, and imparts a\r\nsofter shadowing and contour to the support, without which she herself\r\nhad never risen to light and life. Time passes on. The oak grows old,\r\nthe wall is shattered by lightning; but the Ivy, now strong and firm,\r\nshelters the limbs or binds together the tottering walls with greater\r\ncare than before, and covers decay and rifts with fresh care--aided by\r\nthe younger daughter-vines.\r\n\r\nThis simile has occurred to poets in all lands, in all ages. In an old\r\nChinese poem (JOLOWICZ, _der Poetische Orient_, s. 7) we are told that\r\n'in the south there lives a tree, the Ivy _Ko_ clings and winds around\r\nit, bringing the most excellent of joys and happiness in excess.' Owing\r\nto this natural and most palpable resemblance, the ancient Greeks caused\r\nthe officiating priest in the temple to present to a bridal pair, on\r\nentering, a twig of Ivy, 'as a symbolical wish that their love, like it,\r\nmight ever continue fresh.' It was a beautiful thought, and one which\r\nwas not lost sight of in the ecclesiastical and architectural symbolism\r\nof the middle ages. 'It is,' says FRIEDREICH (_Symbolik und Mythologie\r\nder Natur_, Sec. 103), 'as an ever-greening plant, a type of life, of love,\r\nand of marriage.' It is, therefore, with both truth and propriety that\r\nthe modern floral lexicons give the _vitis hedera_, or Ivy, as\r\nexpressing 'Female affection--I have found one true heart.'\r\n\r\nAs with all plants, or, indeed, with all natural objects known to the\r\nancients, the Ivy was the subject of a myth or religious allegory, and\r\nin investigating this myth, we find ourselves in a labyrinth of strange\r\nmystery. The ordinary works on mythology, indeed, inform the reader that\r\nit was the plant sacred to Bacchus, the god of wine, because, as Loudon\r\nstates, 'this wine is found at Nyssa, the reputed birthplace of Bacchus,\r\nand in no other part of India.' 'It is related,' he continues, 'that\r\nwhen Alexander's army, after their conquest of Babylon, arrived at this\r\nmountain, and found it covered with laurel and Ivy, they were so\r\ntransported with joy (especially when they recognized the latter plant,\r\nwhich is a native of Thebes), that they tore up the Ivy by the roots,\r\nand, twining it around their heads, burst forth into hymns to Bacchus,\r\nand prayers for their native country.'\r\n\r\nBut there is a deeper significance to the Ivy, even as there is a deeper\r\nand more solemn mystery and might around the primeval Bacchus. To us he\r\nis merely the wine-god, but to the ancient Initiated in the orgies and\r\nmysteries he was--as were each of the gods in their turn--the central\r\ndivinity, the lord of light, and the giver of life. For, as it was\r\nconcisely said in the spirit of pantheistic abstraction: 'Nothing can be\r\nimagined which is not an image of God;' so it was not possible to\r\nconceive a divinity who was not in himself all the other divinities.\r\nThus we find that Bacchus was male, female, and at the same time an\r\nabsolute ONE without regard to sex; or, in other words, he was the\r\nancient trinity.\r\n\r\n         'Tibi enim inconsumpta juventus.\r\n   Tu puer aeternus, tu formosissimus alto\r\n   Conspiceris coelo, tibi, cum sine cornibus adstas\r\n   Virgineum caput est.'\r\n\r\n   OVID, _Met._ l. 4.\r\n\r\nFor, as the great mystery of all religion, or of all being, is _life_,\r\nand as life, like blood, is most aptly typified by reviving and\r\ninspiring wine, it was not wonderful that renewed strength, generation,\r\nand birth should gather around the incarnation of the vine, and that the\r\n_cup_ should become the holiest of symbols. Like the ark, the chest or\r\ncoffer, the egg, and a thousand other receptive or _containing_ objects,\r\nthe cup appeared to the ancient Initiated as a womb, or as the earth,\r\ntaking in and giving forth life. It was in this spirit that NONNUS, in\r\nthe fifth century, wrote The Dyonisiacs, a vast poem on Bacchus, in\r\nforty-eight books; 'a magnificent assemblage of the emblematical legends\r\nof Egypt,' and in which modern criticism has discovered a creative\r\ngrandeur, a beautiful wildness of fancy, and a romantic spirit, such as\r\nwere combined in no other one poem of antiquity.\r\n\r\nBacchus was thus the lord of life, and that in a vividly _real_\r\nsense--the sense of intoxication, of keenly thrilling pleasure, of wild\r\ndelight, and headlong rushing joy. He was fabled to have given men the\r\ngrape and wine--but to the Initiated of the mystery and orgie there was\r\nhigher and more intoxicating wine than that of the grape--the wine of\r\nwild inspiration, drawn from the keenest relish of beauty, of nature, of\r\nknowledge, and of love. Drunk with this wine of the soul, the Moenad\r\nand Bacchante rushed forth into lonely forests, amid rocks, by silent\r\nlake, and streamlet lone, and cried in frantic joy, bewildered with\r\npassion, to the Great Parent, or shouted in praise: 'Bacche, Evoe,\r\nBacche!'\r\n\r\n               'Then chaunted rose\r\n   The song of Bacchic women: all the band\r\n   Of shaggy Satyrs howled with mystic voice,\r\n   Preluding to the Phrygian minstrelsy\r\n   Of nightly orgies. Earth around them laughed;\r\n   The rocks reechoed; shouts of revelling joy\r\n   Shrilled from the Naiads, and the river nymphs\r\n   Sent echoes from their whirlpool-circled tides,\r\n   Flowing in silence; and beneath the rocks\r\n   Chanted Sicilian songs, like preludes sweet,\r\n   That through the warbling throats of Syren nymphs,\r\n   Most musical drop of honey from their tongues.'\r\n\r\n   NONNUS.\r\n\r\nFor all this wild joy, all this exquisite union of all the pleasures\r\nknown to man, whether in the mad embraces of passionate nymphs, in\r\ndraining wine, in tasting the fresh honeycomb, in wild dances under\r\ngreen leaves, in feasting, or in song, Bacchus was the centre, and the\r\nCup the symbol. And this cup--the absolutely _feminine_ type--the _Iona_\r\nwhich forms the nucleus of so great and so curious a family of words in\r\nthe Indo-Germanic and Shemitic languages--was fabled to have been formed\r\nfrom the wood of Ivy. Let the reader hear this double sex of Bacchus in\r\nmind; he will find it recurring again in the myth of Ivy. 'We must,'\r\nsays CREUZER (_Symbolik und Mythologie der Alten Voelker_), 'think of ALL\r\nthings, if we would not see the Bacchic genii in their mysterious rites,\r\nfrom a one-sided point of view. Not only Bacchus himself, but his male\r\nand female companions must each, like their lord on earth, appear in\r\n_different_ forms. For the mysteries loved the antique, the\r\npregnant-with-meaning, _i. e._ that which has a really symbolical\r\nfulness, and supplies full food for thought.' And again: 'It would have\r\nbeen very strange if the Man-Woman had not also appeared in this\r\nmysterious array of forms. In his origin, Bacchus is an Indian god, and\r\nto the Hindus the world was bi-sexed.' Thus we find in the Ivy, as his\r\nsacred plant, a curious and beautiful symbol, in whose trailing embraces\r\nthe ancient East and West are bound together.\r\n\r\nIf the Ivy cup was held to typify female nature, so too were the leaves\r\nof that plant emblematical of the receptive sex. The thyrsus, the\r\ndistinctive object borne by the worshippers of Bacchus, was a phallic or\r\nmale symbol, the characteristic portion of which was wreathed and buried\r\nin Ivy leaves; signifying the union of the sexes. It is curious to\r\nobserve that this regarding the Ivy as characteristic of the feminine\r\nprinciple, found its way among the Druids, and was transmitted from them\r\nto the Christian and Christmas ceremonies of the middle ages. In these\r\nwe always find that the thorned holly is spoken of as male, and the Ivy\r\nas female. In the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1779, a correspondent\r\nrelates a ceremony, which is still preserved in some parts of England.\r\n'The girls, from five or six to eighteen years old, were assembled in a\r\ncrowd, burning an uncouth effigy, which they called a _holly-boy_, and\r\nwhich they had stolen from the boys; while in another part of the\r\nvillage, the boys were burning what they called an _Ivy-girl_, which\r\nthey had stolen from the girls. The ceremony of each burning was\r\nattended with huzzas and other acclamations, according to the receipt of\r\ncustom in all such cases.'[1]\r\n\r\nThere is but one legend in all the legends of the gods; but one\r\nsolution, though the enigmas be thousandfold; and the myth of the Ivy is\r\nonly a repetition of that of Bacchus and of all the immortals--the\r\nendless allegory of birth and death, male and female, winter and spring.\r\n_Kissos_--the Greek word for Ivy--was a young faun beloved by Bacchus,\r\nwho accompanied the god of the Cup and of life, in all his strange\r\nadventures. Mad with wine, Kissos once at an orgie danced until he fell\r\ndead. Then his lord, grieving bitterly, raised the beloved form in his\r\narms, and, changing it to Ivy, wreathed it around his brow. It is the\r\nold story of death and revival.\r\n\r\nBut we may expect to find of course a feminine goddess, or demi-goddess,\r\nwhose name includes the same root as Kissos--and she appears in\r\n_Kiseis_, one of the nymphs to whom Bacchus gave the infant Bacchus to\r\nbe brought up. For her reward, she was placed by Bacchus among the\r\nstars--in the constellation of the weeping Hyades--that she might have a\r\nplace in heaven. Apropos of which we may quote the words of the quaint\r\nold Jesuit GALTRUCHIUS, saying that 'Bacchus was brought up with the\r\nNymphs, which teacheth us that we must mix Water with our Wine.'[2]\r\n\r\nWe also find that _Kisaea_, was, at Epidaurus, one of the names of\r\nMinerva. Notwithstanding the apparent dissimilarity between the wild god\r\nof wine and the goddess of calm wisdom, it was still taught in the\r\nmysteries that they had an affinity in more than one lower form, and, of\r\ncourse, an _identity_ in their highest. 'The temple of Bacchus,' says\r\nGaltruchius, 'was next to _Minerva's_, to express how useful Wine is to\r\nrevive the Spirits, and enable our Fancy to Invent.'[3] In the older\r\nworship, Minerva was one with Venus, Diana, Proserpine--the generating\r\nfemale principle of love and of beauty being of course predominant. 'In\r\nthis _unity_ or identity of barbarian divinities,' says Creuzer\r\n(_Symbolik_, IV. _Theil_), ('to speak like the Greeks') 'we must,\r\nhowever, seek for the source of that _variety_ which made the Greeks so\r\nrich in gods; and what had in Hellas been separated into so many,\r\nremained by the 'barbarians' single and undivided. Therefore the older a\r\nGreek local worship might be, so much the more did it in this resemble\r\nthe barbarian. * * So we have truly learned in Argos, Laconia, Dodona,\r\nand Sicily, * * that Proserpine was one and the same with Venus and\r\nDiana, and the identity with Minerva may also be proved.' For the proof\r\nI refer the reader to his work. With Venus, however, Bacchus had amours,\r\nbegetting Priapus. Certain it is that the Ivy _Kissos_ appears in both\r\nmale and female names.\r\n\r\nBut as the Ivy formed the cup--_kissubion_--into which life entered, and\r\nfrom which it was drained as wine; so, too, from its wood was made the\r\nsacred _chest_ (_kiste_) in which, in the Dyonisiac mysteries, the same\r\nsecret was preserved under the form of a serpent, while in the\r\nEleusinian it hid the dread pomegranate which Persephone had tasted. For\r\nthey were all one and the same, this wine and serpent and\r\npomegranate--the type of life and of knowledge--of human birth, and\r\nhuman intellect--of the world's generation and of eternal wisdom. The\r\nfruit of which Adam ate, the bread and wine of the holy supper of the\r\nmysteries of all lands in all ages, the pomegranate, whose seeds, once\r\neaten, kept the soul in another life beyond death, all have _one_\r\nmeaning--and this meaning was that of infinite revival, endless\r\nbegetting, the renewal of nature--and with this the _knowledge_ of the\r\ngreat mystery which sets the soul free. '_Eritis sicut Deus._'\r\n\r\nIt was no small honor for a single plant to have furnished the wreath of\r\nBacchus, the wood of his cup, emblematic of the human body containing\r\nhis life-blood, and the material for the chest of the great\r\nmysteries--meaning also the body and the world. I think, however, that\r\nits philological root may also be possibly found in the Greek noun\r\n_kissa_, and the verb _kissao_, implying strange and excessive\r\npassionate longing. Such yearning would well become the Bacchantae, the\r\nwild children of desire and of Nature. It is longing or _desire_ which\r\nleads to renewing life, which constitutes love, which flashes like fire\r\nand light through the beautiful, and pours forth the wine, and breaks\r\nthe bread, and causes the rose-blush to bloom, and the nymphs to cry\r\namid the mountains, _Evoe Bacche!_\r\n\r\nComing down from the pagan mysteries into lower and more literal forms,\r\nthe Ivy preserved two meanings. It was already the vine of life, and the\r\nearly Christians laid it in the coffins of their departed, as the emblem\r\nof a new life in Christ.[4] It had hung upon the limbs of naked nymphs,\r\nconvulsed in passionate orgies, as a type of vitality renewed by\r\npleasure--it was now wreathed at Christmas-tide over quaint columns and\r\ntracery-laden Gothic windows and arches, as a sign--they knew not\r\nexactly of what--but guessed, naturally enough, and rightly, that it\r\ntypified as an undying winter-plant the resurrection. And they sang its\r\npraises in many a brave carol:\r\n\r\n     IVY, chief of trees it is,\r\n       _Veni coronaberis_.\r\n\r\n   The most worthy she is in town,--\r\n     He who says other says amiss;\r\n   Worthy is she to bear the crown;\r\n       _Veni coronaberis_.\r\n\r\n   IVY is soft and meek of speech,\r\n     Against all woe she bringeth bliss;\r\n   Happy is he that may her reach:\r\n       _Veni coronaberis_.\r\n\r\n   IVY is green, of color bright,\r\n     Of all trees the chief she is;\r\n   And that I prove will now be right:\r\n       _Veni coronaberis_.\r\n\r\n   IVY, she beareth berries black;\r\n     God grant to all of us his bliss,\r\n   For then we shall nothing lack:\r\n       _Veni coronaberis_.\r\n\r\nVery quaint is the following fragment:\r\n\r\n   Holly and Ivy made a great party,\r\n   Who should have the mastery\r\n                    In lands where they go.\r\n\r\n   Then spake Holly, 'I am fierce and jolly,\r\n   I will have the mastery\r\n                    In lands where we go.'\r\n\r\n   Then spake Ivy, 'I am loud and proud,\r\n   And I will have the mastery\r\n                   In lands where we go.'\r\n\r\n   Then spake Holly, and bent him down on his knee,\r\n   'I pray thee, gentle Ivy,\r\n   Essay me no villany\r\n                   In lands where we go.'\r\n\r\n_Old Christmas Carol._\r\n\r\n'Good wine needs no bush,' says an old proverb; but is it generally\r\nknown that the 'bush' in question, used as a sign for wine, was a bunch\r\nof Ivy? The custom went from Greece to Italy, from Italy to Germany, and\r\nso on westward. Very different is this use of the evergreen vine in\r\ntaverns, from that of adorning churches--the one meaning a mere\r\ninvitation to drink, while the other reminds the believer that, as the\r\nIvy lives through the bitter winter, so shall our souls endure through\r\ncold death and live again in Christ, even as He passed through the grave\r\nto live in 'eternal bloom.' Yet to those who have mastered the legend of\r\nBacchus, there is no absolute difference between the two, when studied\r\nwith regard to their origin. It is worth remarking that among the\r\nancients the impression prevailed that the Ivy was the plant of\r\njoyousness, of triumphant strength, and of _life_, even as Bacchus was\r\nthe lord of joy. And at a later day, long after the association with\r\ngenial Bacchus was forgotten, the Ivy in popular lay and legend, and\r\nquaint custom and holiday rite, still by some inexplicable association\r\nalways seemed to the multitude to be sweet and gentle, noble and dear.\r\nIt is such a feeling of love, derived from old traditions and old\r\nworships, long forgotten, which makes the stork and the house-cricket\r\nand the robin and dragon-fly and swallow so dear to children and grown\r\npeople in many parts of Europe. The rose is gone, but the perfume still\r\nlingers in the old leaves of the manuscript. And the reader who\r\ncomprehends this may also comprehend the tender affection for the Ivy\r\nexpressed in the old Christmas carols which I have quoted, and which,\r\nwithout such comprehension, seem absurd enough; while _with_ it, they\r\nappear truly beautiful and touching.\r\n\r\nAs the symbol of a joyous faith, the Ivy seems to have been especially\r\nrepugnant to the Hebrews, whose stern monotheism admitted few attributes\r\nto the Deity save those of tremendous power, vengeance, and gloom. So we\r\nfind (_Maccabees_, book ii., c. 6., v. 7) that it was regarded by them\r\nas most horrible that, 'in the day of the king's birth, every month,\r\nthey were brought, by bitter constraint, to eat of the sacrifices; and,\r\nwhen the feast of Bacchus was kept, the Jews were compelled to go in\r\nprocession to Bacchus, carrying Ivy.' A dislike to this emblem of\r\nheathen joy seems, however, to have clung to them through all changes of\r\nfaith--a fact apparently well known to Ptolemy Philopater, king of\r\nEgypt, who ordered that all the Jewish renegades who had abjured their\r\nreligion should be branded with an Ivy-leaf.\r\n\r\nWhen the reader who may be interested in the architecture of the middle\r\nages meets in its tracery, as he often must, the Ivy-leaf, let him\r\nrecall that here is a symbol which was not used unthinkingly by the Free\r\nMasons, who seldom lost an opportunity to bring forward their orientally\r\nderived Nature-lore. In fact, the whole mass and body of mediaeval\r\narchitectural emblems presents nothing less than a protest of Nature and\r\nlife, independence and intelligence, knowledge and joyousness, against\r\nthe gloomy prison of form and tyranny which held Truth in chains. The\r\nstone Ivy-leaf carved on the capitals of old cathedrals was as reviving\r\na symbol to the heart of the Initiated as was the living Ivy on the\r\nwalls without, green and beautiful among mid-winter's snow. It has been\r\nwell conjectured by a German writer (STIEGLITZ, _Archaeologie der\r\nBaukunst der Griechen und Roemer_, Weimar, 1801, I _Theil_, Sec. 268), that\r\nthe relation of the Ivy to Bacchus was probably the cause why it was so\r\nfrequently introduced by the Greeks among the architectural ornaments of\r\ntheir temples; a very natural conjecture, when we remember that it was a\r\nfirm conviction in the early faith, even of India, that where the Ivy\r\nwas found, the god had literally been. The same bold spirit of tradition\r\nwhich brought into the very bosom of the church so much genial, latent\r\nheresy and heathen daring, kept the Ivy alive--for Nature and Truth\r\n_will_ live, and man will have his guardian angels, who will hope for\r\nhim and for the dawn, though buried in the deepest night and lost among\r\nhorrible dreams and ghastly incubi. A French writer on mediaeval art[5]\r\nhas declared that an excellent work might be written on the foliage of\r\nChristian architecture, but regrets that the relations of the leaves as\r\nemployed--or, in fact, the law guiding their employment--should be\r\nunintelligible. Let them be studied according to their symbolical and\r\nantique meaning, and they will seem clear as legible letters; and to\r\nthose who can read them, the gloomy Gothic piles will ray forth a\r\nstrange and beautiful light--the sympathetic light of congenial minds\r\nlong passed away, yet who did not vanish ere they had breathed out to\r\nthose who were to come after them, in leaf or other character, their\r\nhatred of _the tyrant_, and their unfailing conviction of the Great\r\nTruth. GOD bless them all! I have studied for hours their solemn\r\nsymbols--each a cry for freedom and a prayer for light; and when I\r\nthought of the gloom and cruelty and devilishness of the foul age which\r\npressed around them, I wondered that they, knowing what they did, could\r\nhave lived--ay, lived and sung and given a soul to art. And,\r\nunderstanding them in spirit and in truth, every Ivy-leaf carved by them\r\nseemed the whole Prometheus bound and unbound--yes, all poems of truth,\r\nall myths, all religion.\r\n\r\nAnd as it is the leaf of life, so is it by that very fact the leaf of\r\n_death_; for death is only the water of life. And in this sense we find\r\na rare beauty in the poem by Mrs. Hemans, though she saw its truth, not\r\nthrough the dim glass of tradition, but by direct communion with Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n   TO THE IVY.\r\n\r\n   OCCASIONED BY RECEIVING A LEAF GATHERED\r\n   IN THE CASTLE OF RHEINFELS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Oh! how could fancy crown with thee,\r\n     In ancient days, the god of wine,\r\n   And bid thee at the banquet be,\r\n     Companion of the vine?\r\n   Thy home, wild plant, is where each sound\r\n     Of revelry hath long been o'er;\r\n   Where song's full notes once peal'd around,\r\n     But now are heard no more.\r\n\r\n   The Roman, on his battle plains,\r\n     Where kings before his eagles bent,\r\n   Entwined thee, with exulting strains,\r\n     Around the victor's tent;\r\n   Yet there, though fresh in glossy green,\r\n     Triumphantly thy boughs might wave--\r\n   Better thou lov'st the silent scene\r\n     Around the victor's grave.\r\n\r\n   Where sleep the sons of ages flown,\r\n     The bards and heroes of the past,\r\n   Where through the halls of glory gone,\r\n     Murmurs the wintry blast;\r\n   Where years are hastening to efface\r\n     Each record of the grand and fair--\r\n   Thou, in thy solitary grace,\r\n     Wreath of the tomb! art there.\r\n\r\n   Oh! many a temple, once sublime\r\n     Beneath a blue Italian sky,\r\n   Hath nought of beauty left by time,\r\n     Save thy wild tapestry.\r\n   And, reared 'midst crags and clouds, 'tis thine\r\n     To wave where banners waved of yore,\r\n   O'er towers that crest the noble Rhine,\r\n     Along his rocky shore.\r\n\r\n   High from the fields of air look down\r\n     Those eyries of a vanished race,\r\n   Homes of the mighty, whose renown\r\n     Hath passed and left no trace.\r\n   But thou art there--thy foliage bright,\r\n     Unchanged, the mountain storm can brave--\r\n   Thou that wilt climb the loftiest height,\r\n     And deck the humblest grave.\r\n\r\n   The breathing forms of Parian stone,\r\n     That rise round grandeur's marble halls;\r\n   The vivid hues by painting thrown\r\n     Rich o'er the glowing walls;\r\n   Th' acanthus on Corinthian fanes,\r\n     In sculptured beauty waving fair--\r\n   These perished all--and what remains?\r\n     --Thou, thou alone art there.\r\n\r\n   'Tis still the same--where'er we tread,\r\n     The wrecks of human power we see,\r\n   The marvel of all ages fled,\r\n     Left to decay and thee.\r\n   And still let man his fabrics rear,\r\n     August in beauty, grace, and strength,--\r\n   Days pass, thou 'Ivy never sere,'[6]\r\n     And all is thine at length.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange old belief that Ivy leaves worn as a garland\r\nprevented intoxication, that wine was less exciting when drunk from a\r\ncup of its wood, and that these cups had finally the singular property\r\nof separating water from wine by filtration, when the two were\r\nmingled--or, as it is expressed by MIZALDUS MONLUCIANUS in his\r\ndelightfully absurd 'Centuries,'[7] 'a cup of Ivy, called _cissybius_,\r\nis especially fitted for two reasons, for feasts: firstly, because Ivy\r\nis said to banish drunkenness; and secondly, because by it the frauds of\r\ntavern keepers, who mix wine with water, are detected.' It is worth\r\nremarking, in connection with this, that, according to LOUDON(_Arboretum\r\net Fruticetum Brittanicum_, c. 59), the wood of the Ivy is, when newly\r\ncut, really useful as a filter, though it is highly improbable that\r\nanything like a complete analysis of mingled water and wine can be\r\neffected by it.\r\n\r\nIt may interest the literary critic, should he be ignorant of the fact,\r\nto know that the golden-berried Ivy--worn by Apollo ere he adopted the\r\nDaphnean laurel--is the plant consecrated to his calling. Witness Pope:\r\n\r\n   'Immortal Vida, on whose honored brow\r\n   The poet's bays and critic's Ivy grow.'\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is given to the critics to remind them that they should be\r\nkindly sheltering and warmly protecting to poor poets and others, who\r\nmay be greatly cheered by a little kindness. For there is an old legend\r\nthat the Druids decorated dwelling places with Ivy and holly during the\r\nwinter, 'that the sylvan spirits might repair to them, and remain\r\nunnipped with frost and cold winds, until a milder season had renewed\r\nthe foliage of their darling abodes. (DR. CHANDLER, _Travels in\r\nGreece_.) Think of this when ye ink your pens for the onslaught!\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that in two or three 'Dream Books' the Ivy is set\r\ndown as indicating 'long-continued health, and new friendships'--an\r\nexplanation quite in keeping with its ancient symbolism, and still more\r\nwith its most literal and apparent meaning of _attachment_. This latter\r\nsense has given poet and artist many a fine figure and image. 'Nothing,'\r\nsays ST. PIERRE in his _Studies of Nature_, 'can separate the Ivy from\r\nthe tree which it has once embraced: it clothes it with its own leaves\r\nin that inclement season when its dark boughs are covered with hoar\r\nfrost. The faithful companion of its destiny, it falls when the tree is\r\ncut down: death itself does not relax its grasp; and it continues to\r\nadorn with its verdure the dry trunk that once supported it.'\r\n\r\nAnd of the golden-berried Ivy, Spenser sings:\r\n\r\n   'Emongst the rest, the clamb'ring Ivy grew,\r\n     Knitting his wanton arms with grasping hold,\r\n   Lest that the poplar happely should rew\r\n     Her brother's strokes, whose boughs she doth enfold\r\n   With her lythe twigs, till they the top survew\r\n     And paint with pallid green her buds of gold.'\r\n\r\nMadame DE GENLIS tells us of a true-hearted friend, who clung to a\r\nfallen minister of state, through good and ill fortune, and followed him\r\ninto exile, that he adopted for a 'device' a fallen oak tree thickly\r\nwound with Ivy, and with the motto: 'His fall cannot free me from him.'\r\nAn 'emblem' of the later middle age expresses undying conjugal love in a\r\nlike manner, by a fallen tree wound around with Ivy, beneath which, is\r\nthe inscription in Spanish: '_Se no la vida porque la muerte._'\r\n(RADOWITZ, _Gesammelte Schriften_.) A not uncommon seal gives us the Ivy\r\nwith the motto; 'I die where I attach myself;' while yet another of the\r\nivied fallen trees declares that 'Even ruin cannot separate us.'\r\n\r\nIvy is the badge of the clan Gordon, and of all who bear that name. In\r\nconclusion, lest my readers should object that the subject, though\r\neminently suggestive, has been treated entirely without a jest, I will\r\ncite a quaint repartee, shockingly destructive of the sentiment just\r\ncited:\r\n\r\n'Woman,' said a lovelorn youth, 'is like Ivy--the more you are ruined,\r\nthe closer she clings to you.'\r\n\r\n'And the closer she clings to you, the sooner you are ruined,' replied\r\nan old cynic of a bachelor.\r\n\r\nPoor man! He had never realized the truth of the French saying, that to\r\nenjoy life, there is nothing like being ruined a little.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _New Curiosities of Literature, and Book of the Months._ BY GEORGE\r\nSOANE, B.A. London, 1849, Vol. i., p. 57.\r\n\r\n[2] _The Poetical History._ By P.

'She was going\r\nbackward,' as the French say of people when Time is running forward, and\r\nthey themselves are being forwarded a little too rapidly by his Express.\r\nAll the ladies said so of her; all the gentlemen said so; and, worse\r\nthan all, even the mirror made similar reflections a little--the only\r\ndifference being that the ladies and gentlemen said so behind her back,\r\nbut the mirror expressed it before her face. One by one her sisters and\r\ncompanions ripened and were plucked by the admiring crowd, but Ann\r\nHarriet remained untouched. No one even pinched her to see if she were\r\ngood. And finally, as the throng were rapidly passing on, it became her\r\nsettled conviction that she must shake herself into some one's hands, or\r\nshe would be left to wither forsaken on the ancestral tree.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet, like some patent medicines, was not bad to take. True,\r\nchildren did not cry for her as they did for the famous cough lozenges\r\nof old; but the fact was, that in Peonytown most of the people were\r\nhomoeopathists, and preferred small doses; therefore Ann Harriet, who\r\nwas popularly reported to weigh three hundred and one pounds--_vires\r\nacquirit eundo_--was altogether too large a dose for any gentleman of\r\nthe homoeopathic persuasion. Possibly, if Ann Harriet could have been\r\ndivided into twin sisters of about one hundred and fifty pounds each,\r\nher matrimonial chances would have greatly increased; for however it may\r\nhave been in years past, this putting two volumes into one is not at all\r\npopular at the present _duo_-decimal time.\r\n\r\nBusiness, too, was dull in Peonytown, and the men could not afford to\r\nmarry a wife who would require twenty-five yards for a dress, when they\r\ncould get one that ten yards would cover up.\r\n\r\nMiss Hobbs's twenty-sixth birthday was approaching. She could see it in\r\nthe dim distance, and she knew too well that the twenty-seventh was\r\nready to follow it up; and that Time stepped heavier than he used\r\nto--the clumsy fellow; for, 'handsome' as she was, she could see the\r\nmarks of his feet on her face.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet had an uncle residing in Boston, whom she had never seen,\r\nbut had often heard him favorably spoken of by her mother, whose only\r\nbrother he was. Ann therefore determined that she would write to her\r\nUncle Farnsworth, and ask him if it would be agreeable should she visit\r\nhim for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nHer letter met with a cordial response from the old gentleman, who\r\nexpressed himself 'highly gratified at the prospect' of seeing his\r\nsister's daughter; named the day for her to come, and said that Gregory,\r\nhis son, would meet her at the railroad station in Boston, when the\r\ntrain arrived.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet had never been in Boston, and the thoughts of a journey\r\nthither animated her 'to a degree.' Her wardrobe was renovated; a\r\nbran-new bonnet was purchased; and as all Peonytown was informed that it\r\nwas to be deprived of her presence for several weeks, the\r\n'meeting-house' was of course filled on the following Sunday to hear\r\nParson Bulger preach about it; for he was one of the new-fashioned\r\nministers, who considered the Bible as a wornout book, and generally\r\npreached from a newspaper text, or the last exciting piece of news.\r\nAlas! they were disappointed; for the sermon was on Barnum's Baby Show.\r\n\r\nThe appointed day came, and Ann Harriet paid Seth Bullard, the butcher's\r\nboy, a quarter of a dollar to 'carry' her and her luggage over to the\r\nYellowfield depot, where she was to take the cars for Boston. She bore\r\nin her hand a rhubarb pie, nicely tied up in a copy of the _Peonytown\r\nClarion_, which was intended as a gift for her Aunt Farnsworth. It was a\r\npie she made with her own hands, and would have taken a prize for size\r\nat any cattle show.\r\n\r\nAfter asking engineer, brakeman, and conductor which they thought the\r\nsafest car, and getting a different answer from each, she finally\r\nensconced herself in the third car from the engine. Opening the window,\r\nher attention was attracted by a neat tin sign, on which was painted,\r\n'_Look out for Pickpockets!_'\r\n\r\n'Now, that is kind,' said she, 'to give people notice. I forgot all\r\nabout pickpockets. I would really like to see some, and will certainly\r\nlook out for them.''\r\n\r\nShe accordingly thrust her head and neck out of the car window, and\r\nlooked sharply at the bystanders. While engaged in this detective\r\nservice, the signal was given, and the cars started, when Miss Hobbs,\r\nthinking it was needless to keep up a longer lookout, reentered, and was\r\nsurprised to find a nice-looking young man by her side. He wore a heavy\r\nyellow watchguard, yellow kid gloves, and a moustache to match,\r\npatent-leather boots, a poll-parrot scarf, and a brilliant breast-pin.\r\nAnn Harriet was delighted to have such a companion; and her wish that he\r\nwould enter into conversation was soon gratified.\r\n\r\n'Travelling far?' asked the 'city-looking chap.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir; I am going to my uncle's, in Boston,' replied Ann Harriet.\r\n\r\n'Taking a vacation, I suppose?' continued he of the yellow kids.\r\n\r\n['How delightful!' thought Miss Hobbs; 'he takes me for a\r\nboarding-school girl.']\r\n\r\n'For a few weeks,' replied she, with a bland smile; and dropping her\r\nblack lace veil to improve her really fine complexion, knowing, as well\r\nas Shakspeare, that\r\n\r\n   'Beauty, blemished once, is ever lost,\r\n   In spite of physic, painting, pains, and cost.'\r\n\r\n'Is not this Miss Hobbs, of Peonytown?' suddenly asked the proprietor of\r\nthe patent leathers, after a few minutes' conversation.\r\n\r\n'Why! yes; how _did_ you know?' was Ann Harriet's reply.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I had a friend as went to the academy in Peonytown, and he always\r\nkept me posted up on the pretty girls; and he talked about you so often,\r\nI knew it _must_ be Miss Hobbs,' was the flattering answer.\r\n\r\n'How strange!' thought Ann Harriet. 'Well, it proves that I am not\r\nwholly overlooked by the young men of my native village.' She did not\r\nremember that she carried a little satchel, on which the stranger had\r\nread, 'ANN HARRIET HOBBS, _Peonytown_.'\r\n\r\nAt this time a boy entered the car with a supply of ice water for\r\nthirsty passengers. In handing a glassful to Miss Hobbs, he spilled a\r\npart on the floor.\r\n\r\n'What a waste!' remarked he.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet blushed deep crimson--fat folks are always sensitive--and,\r\nwith a grave, fat, solemn air, she said:\r\n\r\n'I think you are quite rude, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I'd like to know how?' inquired he, with a look of surprise.\r\n\r\n'By making remarks on my waist, sir. No gentleman would be guilty of\r\nsuch an offence,' replied the indignant lady.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the train at this juncture stopped at a way station, and\r\nthe yellow moustache, poll-parrot scarf, and kid gloves got out, first\r\nbowing very politely to their late companion. Ann Harriet was a little\r\nsorry to have their inmate go, but consoled herself with the thought\r\nthat he was altogether too familiar.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen miles farther on, an orange boy made his appearance; and\r\nAnn, thinking an orange would moisten her throat, felt for her\r\nportemonnaie, and found it not; for, while she was so intently looking\r\n_out_ for pickpockets at Yellowfield, her agreeable companion had\r\nappropriated her cash, by looking _in_ her pocket.\r\n\r\n'_There!_ that dandy villain has robbed me of my wallet, with fifteen\r\ndollars in it, and the receipt for Sally Lunn cake I was going to give\r\nAunt Farnsworth!' exclaimed she, placidly. Stout folks bear disasters\r\ncalmly. Luckily, she had two or three dollars in her satchel, which she\r\nhad received from the ticket master when she purchased her ticket, so\r\nshe was not entirely bankrupt. Some of the passengers attempted to\r\nsympathize with her, but they found it a thankless task, and soon\r\ndesisted.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet, her griefs digested, drew herself into as compact a compass\r\nas possible, and in a few minutes was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThe cars rolled, in due time, into the noisy station at Boston, and our\r\ntraveller, after much exertion and trepidation, safely reached the\r\nplatform, with her rhubarb pie unharmed. She looked anxiously around for\r\nher cousin Gregory, whom she had never seen, save in his _carte de\r\nvisite_, and by that she found him in a few minutes. Gregory was a\r\nhandsome man, quite young, and dressed in a neat suit of light clothes,\r\ndonned that afternoon for the first time. He had never seen his cousin,\r\nand was therefore not a little surprised when the corpulent beauty\r\nintroduced herself as Miss Ann Harriet Hobbs, of Peonytown. Gregory had\r\ncome down to the station with a light buggy, in which he intended to\r\nconvey his fair relative home, but at the first glance saw that it would\r\nbe disastrous both to the buggy and Ann Harriet to attempt any such\r\nfeat. He therefore escorted her to a hack, and left her a moment. While\r\nhe was gone, Ann Harriet, who had forgotten all her troubles in the\r\ncontemplation of riding home with her handsome cousin, laid the rhubarb\r\npie on the opposite seat of the carriage, reserving the place by her\r\nside for Gregory. But this gentleman, not feeling sure that he would\r\nfind room by the side of his massive cousin, when he entered the\r\ncarriage, sat hastily down opposite her. _Crash_ went the _Peonytown\r\nClarion_, and 'sqush' went the juicy rhubarb, completely saturating\r\nGregory's new garments. Ann Harriet gave a loud shriek, exclaiming: 'Oh!\r\nyou have spoilt that nice pie that I made for Aunt Priscilla, from Mrs.\r\nWilkins's receipt.'\r\n\r\n'Hang Mrs. Wilkins's receipt!' exclaimed Gregory, who was imperturbable.\r\n'I think I shall have to get some one to reseat my pantaloons.'\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be done but to drive home as quickly as possible.\r\nThe hackman was paid for the damage to his vehicle, and Gregory hastened\r\nup stairs to resume the old suit which only a few hours before he had\r\nthrown aside disdainfully.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet found her uncle's family all that she expected. They found\r\nher a little more than they expected. Everything was done to make her\r\ncomfortable. Aunt Farnsworth condoled with her niece on the loss of her\r\nmoney, and the receipt for Sally Lunn cake. They brought a fan to cool\r\nher, and placed a footstool for her feet. Her cousin Miranda exhibited a\r\nphotograph album containing all the family likenesses, besides a number\r\nthey had purchased to fill up the book, such as the Prince of Wales,\r\nMcClellan, Stonewall Jackson, Beauregard, and Butler. All this comforted\r\nher greatly, and Ann Harriet was much interested, but was obliged to\r\ninquire which were fighting for the North, and which for the South--'she\r\nhad heard something about it, but was not thoroughly informed,'--for, to\r\ntell the truth, the only medium for news in Peonytown was the _Clarion_,\r\nand the only portion of even that which Ann Harriet attended to was the\r\ndeaths, marriages, and dry goods.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the day passed quietly, and the hour for retiring\r\napproached. Before Ann Harriet's arrival, it had been arranged that she\r\nshould share Miranda's bed; but it was now very evident that Ann would\r\nget very much more than her share, and it was therefore decided to give\r\nher a bed to herself. A lamp was brought, and Aunt Farnsworth escorted\r\nher to her room, and bade her good night. Ann Harriet had the usual\r\nshare of curiosity which all females--even plump ones--possess; and\r\nwishing to know how a Boston street appeared in the evening, she hoisted\r\nthe curtain with a vigorous jerk, and looked forth: it was not a very\r\nbeautiful scene; long rows of brick houses stretched away on either\r\nside, relieved at intervals by the street lamps and loafers, which, as\r\nthey appeared at a distance, reminded her of a torchlight procession she\r\nhad witnessed once in Peonytown, when the Hickory Club turned out with\r\ntwenty torches and a colored lantern. Having satisfied her eyes with the\r\nview, she attempted to draw down the curtain, and found that it would\r\nnot move. She had pulled it up so vigorously that the cord had slipped\r\nfrom the wheel, and rendered the curtain immovable. By stepping on a\r\nchair she could, indeed, reach and adjust it; but the only chairs in the\r\nroom were cane-seated, and seemed altogether too fragile for such a\r\nweighty lady as Ann Harriet. To add to her perplexity, the dwelling\r\ndirectly opposite was a boarding house, full of young men; and she\r\nnoticed that one or two of them had already discovered her, and that the\r\nnews was probably being communicated to all their fellow boarders, for\r\nin a very few minutes every window had two or more spectators at it,\r\narmed with opera or eye glasses, while one saucy fellow had a telescope\r\nthree feet long. What to do she did not know: there was but one window\r\nin the room, and no recess into which her portly beauty could retreat.\r\nOnce more she tried the curtain, giving it a forcible twitch, and this\r\ntime it came down--but the whole fixture came with it, and, after\r\nstriking her on the head, slid out of the window into the street, much\r\nto the amusement of the spectators opposite.\r\n\r\nHere was a dilemma--and what would her aunt say? She had to give up all\r\nhope of excluding the gaze of her impudent neighbors. Poor damsel! She\r\nwould have asked assistance of some of the family, but they had all been\r\nasleep some time, and she disliked to disturb them. Finally, she decided\r\nto extinguish her light and undress in bed--a difficult undertaking,\r\nwhich was, however, accomplished, with the loss of sundry strings and\r\nbuttons; and Ann Harriet laid her wearied head on the pillow, and\r\nthought her troubles for that day were over. But Sleep forsakes the\r\nwretched, and her eyes would not 'stay shut.' While coaxing them to\r\n'stay down,' she was startled by a flash of light on the wall and an\r\nexplosion, then another, and then a third, accompanied by a shower of\r\ngravelly substance in her face and eyes. Miss Hobbs, as we have seen,\r\nwas\r\n\r\n   'A woman naturally born to fears,'\r\n\r\nand this sudden and inexplicable exhibition of fireworks in her chamber\r\nalmost burst the strings of her night cap, by causing her curly black\r\nhair to stand on end.\r\n\r\nThe mischievous young men opposite had procured a _sarbacane_--vulgarly\r\nknown as a 'bean-blower,'--and were shooting torpedoes into Ann\r\nHarriet's chamber. Not daring to rise to shut the window, she was wholly\r\nat their mercy; but fortunately their stock of ammunition was limited to\r\nhalf a dozen pellets, and in a few minutes the bombardment ceased.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight Ann Harriet fell into a deep slumber, and when she awoke\r\nthe broad sunshine was illuminating her chamber, while the rattling of\r\nteams along the paved streets reminded her that she was in the great\r\nmetropolis of New England. She missed the green foliage and healthy\r\nperfume and bird songs of her pleasant country home: all she could see\r\nwas a combination of bricks, slate, and stone; and not a green thing was\r\nvisible in the street, save a few Irish servants, who were washing off\r\nthe doorsteps and sidewalks. In the middle of the cobble stones lay the\r\ncurtain which had fallen during the scene of the previous evening, muddy\r\nand torn, its sticks broken by the heavy wagons which had passed over\r\nit. A glance at the hostile boarding-house assured her that all was\r\nquiet there; so, after arranging her dress with studied nicety, and\r\ndisposing her hair in the most enchanting style--and Ann Harriet was\r\nreally neat and winsome--she descended to the breakfast room. Her cousin\r\nGregory was the only person present--he sat by the window, reading.\r\nAfter the customary greeting, Ann Harriet inquired what interested him.\r\n\r\n'I have been glancing over an article called 'Ludicrous Exaggerations,'\r\nin Leigh Hunt's _Indicator_,' replied Gregory, with a mischievous\r\ntwinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet did not notice any point to this remark, but said: 'I do not\r\nremember having seen that book.'\r\n\r\n'What have _you_ been reading lately?' pursued Gregory.\r\n\r\n'Oh! I have begun a splendid book that Mrs. Orrin Pendergast lent me; I\r\nhave forgotten who wrote it, but its name is 'The Bloody Butcher's\r\nBride; or, The Demon of Dandelion Dell.'\r\n\r\nHere Gregory was so impolite as to burst into a loud laugh, much to the\r\ndiscomfiture of Ann Harriet, who was on the point of describing a\r\nthrilling scene in the story.\r\n\r\n'I see nothing to laugh at,' remarked she, solemnly; 'it is a _very_\r\nnice book, Cousin Gregory. Why, some parts of it were so powerful that\r\nit made me tremble all over.'\r\n\r\n'It _must_ have been powerful,' said Gregory, drily.\r\n\r\n'You're a saucy fellow,' said his cousin. 'But, by the way, where is\r\nthat new suit that was damaged yesterday? You do not look so stylish\r\nthis morning.'\r\n\r\n'Stylish? I hope not. I hate that word; it is only fit to be applied to\r\npigs; they always look sty-lish,' replied Gregory.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the rest of the family appeared, much to Ann\r\nHarriet's discomfort, for she liked her cousin, and was just thinking\r\nhow she could make an impression upon him. The surest way would have\r\nbeen to sit in his lap.\r\n\r\nThey seated themselves at the table, when the customary question came\r\nfrom Aunt Farnsworth:\r\n\r\n'How did you rest last night, Ann Harriet?'\r\n\r\nThis, of course, called forth the history of the mishaps she had\r\nexperienced, and the indignation of her uncle and aunt was great when\r\nthey heard how the occupants of the boarding house had behaved.\r\n\r\n'Those young men over there are Boarder Ruffians,' remarked Gregory.\r\n\r\n'Mercy!' exclaimed his fat cousin; 'if I had known that, I shouldn't\r\nhave slept a wink all night. I have heard Miss Pendergast tell about\r\nthose awful men: she had a sister out in Kansas, and a parcel of Border\r\nRuffians came to her house one Sabbath day and ate up everything she\r\nhad, and then carried off her cow and five pullets.'\r\n\r\n'What cow-ardly and chicken-hearted fellows, to rob a poor woman in that\r\nmanner!' remarked Gregory, grimly.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes,' said Ann Harriet; 'and they spit tobacco juice all over her\r\nclean floor, and whittled all over the hearth, and told her it was lucky\r\nfor her that she was a widow, for if she hadn't been, they would have\r\nmade her one. I should think you would feel dreadfully to have a whole\r\nhouseful right opposite.'\r\n\r\n'We do feel pretty dreadfully,' replied Gregory; 'often.'\r\n\r\n'Miranda, you must have a little company while your cousin is here, and\r\nmake her acquainted with some of the ladies and gentlemen of the city,'\r\nsaid Aunt Farnsworth.\r\n\r\n'I should like to, very much, mother; and if you are willing, I will set\r\nabout it immediately after breakfast; and perhaps I can arrange things\r\nso as to have it to-morrow night,' was Miranda's reply.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was eagerly seconded by Gregory, who always enjoyed the\r\nsocial parties that his sister had a peculiar knack in getting up at\r\nshort notice.\r\n\r\nTheir pleasant anticipations of the _soiree_ were suddenly checked by\r\nquite a melancholy mishap to the solid Ann Harriet. In reaching forward\r\nto receive a cup of coffee from her aunt, she was obliged to rise a\r\nlittle from her seat. Now, the chair in which she was sitting had been\r\nbroken the day before and was glued together, strong enough for any\r\nordinary usage, but wholly inadequate to sustain such a weight as now\r\ntaxed it; so when Ann 'set back' into the furniture, the already\r\nstrained joints came apart, and she felt herself descending to the\r\nfloor; to save herself, she clung to the edge of the table, but, of\r\ncourse, that was no support; on the contrary, it tilted up and launched\r\nits whole contents over the prostrate form of the unfortunate Ann\r\nHarriet. There she lay, pinned to the floor by the heavy table, while\r\nher face and neck and dress were covered with butter, gooseberry pie,\r\nhot coffee, broken eggs, and slices of fried ham. The carpet was in a\r\nsimilar condition, and the Old Dominion coffee-pot was found expiring\r\nunder the sofa.\r\n\r\nMr. Farnsworth, in an attempt to save the table from going over, lost\r\nhis own balance, and fell flounder-flat on the floor, where he lay\r\nshuddering, with his hair in a dish of Shaker apple-sauce: the rest of\r\nthe family escaped unscathed, but were sadly astonished at the sudden\r\nturn things had taken.\r\n\r\nMr. Farnsworth and Gregory raised the fallen table to its former\r\nposition, and Miranda set about collecting the scattered dishes.\r\n\r\n'I knew that we were going to breakfast, but I did not think we should\r\nbreak so fast as that,' remarked Gregory, ruefully.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet, up to this time, had retained her consciousness, when it\r\nsuddenly occurred to her that, in the stories she had read, the heroines\r\nalways fainted when anything unusual happened; so she shut up her eyes\r\nand began to gasp, just as her uncle and cousin were about to assist her\r\nto her feet.\r\n\r\n'She is faint; get some water, quick!' exclaimed Miranda.\r\n\r\nGregory seized the 'Old Dominion,' and dashed what coffee there was left\r\nin it on Ann's face, then threw on all the cream in the pitcher, and\r\nwound up his frightful orgie by emptying over her locks a lot of brown\r\nsugar from a bowl which stood near. The effect was that the faint damsel\r\n'came to' very fast, and requested to be helped up. Her aspect was\r\nremarkably ludicrous; the moistened sugar, clinging to her hair and\r\nplastering up her eyes, caused so much mirth on Gregory's part that he\r\ncould hardly restrain it within the bounds of politeness.\r\n\r\n'Oh, _do_ help me up!' implored Ann Harriet.\r\n\r\nEasier said than done. Mr. Farnsworth took hold of one arm, and Gregory\r\nthe other, but their united effort was not sufficient. Mr. Farnsworth\r\nhad but recently recovered from an attack of the rheumatism--and apple\r\nsauce--and was by no means strong enough for such work; while Gregory\r\nwas so full of laughter that it deprived him of half his strength. After\r\none or two futile attempts, Miranda had a happy thought: she ran into\r\nthe parlor and brought out half a dozen thick volumes of music; then\r\nGregory and his father lifted Ann Harriet as far as they could at one\r\neffort, while Miranda pushed a book under; at the next lift, a second\r\nbook was inserted, and this movement was repeated until Ann was\r\nseated--_alto_ and _allegro_--on a pile of six large music books. Aunt\r\nFarnsworth then brought a basin of water, and carefully bathed her\r\nniece's face, removing all traces of the catastrophe, in which she was\r\nassisted by a copious flood of tears from Ann's eyes--so copious,\r\nindeed, that Gregory guessed there would be a rainbow when she ceased.\r\n\r\nIn about twenty minutes 'things were put as near to rights as possible,'\r\nbut their appetites, like the breakfast, were thoroughly spoilt; so\r\nMiranda and her cousin went up stairs to make their plans for the\r\nentertainment, which was to be given in honor of the fair Peonytowner.\r\nThis kept them busy all day; for there was shopping to be done, pastry\r\nand cake to be made, dresses to be 'fixed,' and other arrangements, 'too\r\nnumerous to mention.'\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet's thoughts dwelt incessantly on the appointed evening; the\r\niron would then be hot, and she knew that she must strike, or lose a\r\ngolden opportunity for exchanging the desolate monotony of a heavy\r\nsingle life for the sparkling, honorable, enviable title of wedded wife.\r\n\r\nSurely, Ann Harriet, he who leads thee to the altar will possess a brave\r\nand stout heart--one on whom you, although fat, can lean, and of whose\r\nhome you, though heavy, will be the light. You will so fill his heart\r\nthat there will be no room for discontent, melancholy, or any evil or\r\nmischievous visitor. Whoever the fortunate man may be, you can rest\r\nassured that you will exceed his greatest expectations, and he will not\r\nattempt to exaggerate your charms and attractions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n   'There was music and mirth in the lighted saloon;\r\n   The measure was merry--our hearts were in tune;\r\n   While hand linked with hand in the graceful quadrille,\r\n   Bright joy crowned the dance, like the sun on the rill,\r\n   And beamed in the dark eyes of coquettes and snobs;\r\n   But the belle of the hall was Ann Harriet Hobbs.'\r\n\r\n   MRS. OSGOOD (with slight variation).\r\n\r\n\r\nBright shone the gas at Mr. Farnsworth's on the evening of the grand\r\n_soiree_ given for the gratification of Ann Harriet, who was anxious to\r\nsee some of the beaux of Boston. Both of the parlor chandeliers were in\r\nfull blaze, much to the delight of Miss Hobbs, who, after gazing at them\r\nin admiration, expressed the wish that her friend surnamed Pendergast\r\nmight see such a sight.\r\n\r\n'That takes the shine all off of Miss Pendergasses' double back-action,\r\nself-adjusting, anti-corrosive, herring-bone, powerloom lamp, don't it,\r\nmy dear cousin?' asked Gregory, who had been regaled several times with\r\nan account of a wonderful lamp that burnt one hour at a cost of only ten\r\ncents, or ten hours at a cost of one cent--Gregory never could remember\r\nwhich.\r\n\r\n'Now, Gregory, if you bother me so, I sha'n't tell you anything more;\r\nplease hand me that fan on the table, and tell me who that man is by the\r\ncorner of the mantelpiece.'\r\n\r\n'That is Captain Dobbs; he is very fond of poetry, and has written some,\r\ntoo; but it was never published, for the editors charged too much for\r\nputting it into their papers. Shall I introduce him to you?' said\r\nGregory.\r\n\r\n'A captain and a poet, too? Oh, certainly, I should be delighted to know\r\nhim,' replied Ann Harriet, who began to cool down her countenance by a\r\nvigorous application of the fan, while Gregory went after the poetical\r\ncaptain. He was soon back again, and presented him, as follows:\r\n\r\n'Captain Dobbs, Miss Hobbs; Miss Hobbs, Captain Dobbs.'\r\n\r\nThe Captain bowed so low that Ann Harriet could see the brass buttons on\r\nthe back of his coat, and then, taking her hand, he said, earnestly:\r\n\r\n'I rejoice exceedingly that our acquaintance with each other should have\r\ncommenced under such charming auspices!'\r\n\r\nNow, they were standing directly under one of the beautiful chandeliers,\r\nwhich glistened with brilliant pendants; and Ann, supposing that the\r\ngallant Captain alluded to them, accordingly replied:\r\n\r\n'Yes, they are very charming auspices, and make a beautiful jingle.'\r\n\r\nWhat the Captain really alluded to was the rhyming of their names when\r\nGregory introduced them; the jingle of the rhyme pleased him much, and\r\nhe regarded it as propitious to their future acquaintance: Ann Harriet's\r\nreply happened to suit the case precisely, and placed her in high\r\nestimation with the Captain.\r\n\r\nDrummond Dobbs was about thirty-two years of age, a gentleman, and a\r\nright good fellow, but so _very_ sentimental that few ladies could\r\nendure his company. Yet was he anxious to please the fair sex and be\r\npopular with them: unfortunately, he supposed that the way to be so was\r\nto shower on them love-sick poetry and sentimental speeches; 'he wore\r\nhis heart upon his sleeve,' fell in love with every new face, and had\r\nbeen rejected a score of times; he comforted himself, however, with the\r\nvery scaly proverb, 'there is as good fish in the sea as ever was\r\ncaught,' and--cast in his line for another chance. He had tried poor\r\nwomen and rich women, young school-girls and elastic old maids,\r\nbrunettes and blondes, but all in vain; and the moment he saw Ann\r\nHarriet he determined to make one more attempt to secure a heart that\r\nshould beat for him alone, an ear that should be ever on the alert for\r\nhis footstep, and eyes that should sparkle only when he was near.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet, on her part, saw all in Captain Dobbs that she could wish\r\nfor; and she thought that if she could return to Peonytown with a live\r\ncaptain as her affianced lover, she should be the happiest of fat girls.\r\nWhat a sensation she would create on Sunday, when she went to meeting\r\narm in arm with him, and _how_ the folks would stare at his bright\r\nbuttons and shoulder straps! She wondered if he would wear a 'trainer\r\nhat,' with feathers in it.\r\n\r\nTo Captain Dobbs, Ann Harriet Hobbs was 'a devilish fine-looking woman;'\r\nthere was something tangible in a woman like that, sir; _she_ was not\r\none of your flimsy, languid girls, with waist like the stem of a goblet.\r\nSomebody had said,'the nearer the bone the sweeter the meat,' but he did\r\nnot believe in that; he wanted a _wife_, and if he could get one twice\r\nthe size of any one else's, so much the better, by Jove!\r\n\r\nGregory, with the tact of Young America, saw instantly what the result\r\nof an evening's interview would be; so, telling Dobbs that he would find\r\nhis cousin from Peonytown very in-_fat_-uating, he left them to their\r\nown enjoyment.\r\n\r\n'It is very singular,' remarked the Captain, promptly, 'how much alike\r\nour names are: Hobbs and Dobbs!'\r\n\r\n'Yes; but I think that yours is much the prettiest; I always hated the\r\nname of Hobbs,' remarked Ann Harriet.\r\n\r\n'Hate Hobbs? Well, I detest Dobbs; but you have the advantage of me, for\r\nyou can change yours without much trouble,' replied the Captain.\r\n\r\nHe did not know that Ann Harriet had been longer, and at more trouble,\r\nin trying to get her name changed, than if she had applied to seven\r\nlegislatures. She blushed deeply, and raised her fan to hide the rosy\r\nhue--but it was a small, round fan, and only partially concealed her\r\nface, leaving a crimson disk of two inches around it. Captain Dobbs was\r\ndelighted; a blush to him was a certain proof of maiden coyness, and\r\nbespoke a heart so full of love that every emotion sent it mantling to\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\nGregory here returned, to say that they were getting up a dance, and\r\nCaptain Dobbs and his cousin must certainly join in it.\r\n\r\n'But I never danced in my life!' said Ann Harriet, innocently.\r\n\r\n'Oh, never mind _that_; it is a very simple dance--the Virginia Reel;\r\nevery one can dance that; only do as others do,' replied Gregory.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet, accepting Captain Dobbs's proffered arm, proceeded to the\r\nroom where the arrangements for the dance were progressing.\r\n\r\n'I understand that Miss Hobbs is the star of this business,' remarked\r\nMr. Pickett to Gregory, as he crammed himself behind a bookcase, to\r\nallow the lady and her escort to go by.\r\n\r\n'Star? ' repeated Gregory. 'Yes; the full moon of the concern.'\r\n\r\n'You mean of the firm,' quoth Pickett.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' replied Gregory, 'the full moon of the firm, I meant.'\r\n\r\nThe dancers took their places, and a merry tune soon set them in motion.\r\nAnn Harriet watched the others carefully, and soon understood the\r\nfigure. At length her turn came to advance. She performed her part very\r\nwell until she came to that step known as _dos a dos_, and here her good\r\nluck forsook her; for, in stepping back, she struck with full force her\r\ncompanion, a slim young man with shell eyeglasses, and sent him forward\r\nwith an impetus which was only checked by his coming in collision with a\r\nplaster-of-Paris pedestal, on which stood a bust of General Zachary\r\nTaylor; his head penetrated the column, and the bust came down on his\r\nback with a thump that nearly knocked the breath out of his body. His\r\neyeglasses were shattered, his soul rent, and his shirt bosom torn\r\nasunder. The unfortunate youth gathered himself up and retreated to an\r\nanteroom, where he rearranged his disordered clothing; but was not seen\r\nagain, having disappeared through a side door and hastened home.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet came out of the collision like a second 'Monitor,' unscathed\r\nand undaunted; indeed, she was not aware that anything unusual had\r\nhappened till she heard the crash, and then was surprised to learn that\r\nshe was the cause of the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nWhen our heroine heard how serious the collision had been, she felt much\r\ndisturbed, until Gregory observed that, although she had been backward\r\nin causing the mishap, she should not be backward in making what\r\nreparation she could.\r\n\r\nOn this suggestion, Ann Harriet inquired the whereabouts of Mr. Google,\r\nand learning that he was in an anteroom, started in search of him. She\r\nfound herself in the supper room, hurrying across which, she pulled open\r\na door on the other side with such a vigorous effort of elephantine\r\nstrength, as to precipitate a waiter, who had just caught hold of the\r\nhandle, headlong into the room. The unfortunate servitor, who was\r\ndressed in white cravat and black coat, landed under the supper table,\r\nwhere he lay motionless. Ann Harriet made her way back to the parlor as\r\nquickly as possible, where she startled the visitors by exclaiming:\r\n\r\n'Oh dear, come here, quick! I have killed a minister!'\r\n\r\nMiss Helen Bumpus, who was playing a quickstep on the pianoforte,\r\nuttered a sharp shriek, which was echoed from various parts of the room,\r\nand the whole company, headed by Captain Dobbs, followed Ann Harriet to\r\nthe scene of the disaster.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the dining room they found her 'minister' sitting on\r\nthe floor, rubbing his head, and using language more appropriate to one\r\nof Captain Kidd's profession than to an expounder of the gospel. When\r\nthe damaged waiter saw the immense crowd entering the room, he vanished\r\ninto the kitchen amid shouts of laughter from the assembly, who\r\ncomprehended at once Miss Hobbs's error. Ann Harriet felt much relieved\r\nto find that the accident was no worse, and explained the mishap to her\r\nfriends, ending by inquiring what denomination he belonged to. Gregory\r\ninformed her that the individual was not a clergyman, but a lay-man and\r\na waiter.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the guests were requested to repair to the supper room, and\r\neach gentleman chose his partner for the occasion. Unfortunately for Ann\r\nHarriet, Captain Dobbs chanced to be at the farther end of the room, and\r\nbefore he reached the object of his adoration she had already accepted\r\nthe arm of an exquisite youth with patent eyeglass, pink necktie, and\r\ntomato-colored moustache. The disappointment nearly destroyed Dobbs's\r\nappetite. He had intended to be irresistibly attentive to Miss Hobbs; to\r\nfurnish her with every little delicacy the table afforded; and _now_,\r\nshe must depend upon the languid movements of a 'snob:' it was too bad,\r\nby Jove!\r\n\r\nThe table was elegantly decorated with flowers, and the neatly prepared\r\ndishes and ministerial waiters presented a scene which to Ann Harriet's\r\nvision was enchanting.\r\n\r\n'What shall I have the pleasure of obtaining for you?' asked Mr.\r\nStruttles of Ann Harriet.\r\n\r\n'Let me see,' replied Ann. 'It's some time since I eat anything, and I\r\nfeel pretty hungry: if you will get me a plateful of pandowdy[8] and\r\nsome ginger snaps, I shall feel thankful.'\r\n\r\nMr. Struttles was a very polite man, and would not laugh in a lady's\r\nface for a farm; but his tomato-hued moustache quivered, and he had to\r\nfrown fiercely to conceal the laughter which threatened to burst him\r\nasunder.\r\n\r\n'What amuses you so much, Strut?' asked a friend, who found him a few\r\nmoments later in the entry, giggling all by himself.\r\n\r\n'Oh dear! I shall die!' he replied, shaking with mirth; 'that fat girl\r\nasked me to get her something to eat that I never heard of: I believe\r\nshe called it _slam dowdy_, or rip snap, or something like that, and, of\r\ncourse, there is nothing of the kind on the table.'\r\n\r\n'Go and tell her it is all eaten up,' suggested the friend; 'article all\r\nsold.'\r\n\r\nStruttles had not thought of that; it was a good idea, so off he went\r\nand told Ann Harriet that the object she wished had been so fashionable\r\nthat it was all devoured before he reached it.\r\n\r\n'Oh, well! I had just as lief have some gingerbread and a pickle-lime,'\r\nwas her calm response.\r\n\r\nStruttles rushed desperately to the table, filled a plate full of\r\nanything that came handy, brought it to his dame, and informed her that\r\nthere was not a pickled lime to be had. Ann Harriet did not care; she\r\nwas soon busy devouring the contents of the plate, while Struttles stood\r\nby, chuckling and grinning.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dobbs, in the mean time, was doing all he could to make hungry\r\nand handsome Miss Helen Bumpus happy, by giving her oyster salad, ice\r\ncream, frozen pudding, and cake, with plenty of champagne to wash it\r\ndown; but his heart was with Ann Harriet, and many an anxious glance he\r\nbestowed on her, to see if she was well supplied with the niceties of\r\nthe festive board. He thrilled with joy at seeing her behind a plate\r\npiled nearly as high as her chin with a variety of cakes, tarts, fruits,\r\nand jellies.\r\n\r\nAfter a while every one was surfeited, and gradually the supper room was\r\ndeserted, leaving none but the waiters, who quickly cleared away what\r\nthere was left of the supper.\r\n\r\nOn entering the parlor, Captain Dobbs caught a view of himself in a\r\nlarge mirror, and saw to his dismay that he had not escaped the usual\r\nfate of gallants who endeavor to make themselves agreeable to the ladies\r\nin a crowded supper-room; lumps of blanc-mange adhered to his shirt\r\nbosom; particles of calf's-foot jelly coruscated like gems on his\r\npatent-leather gaiters, and quivering oysters hung tenaciously to his\r\ncoat sleeves. He looked around for some place of refuge where he could\r\nretire and remove the remnants of the banquet, and espying a side room\r\napparently deserted, there being no light in it, stepped in, and, taking\r\noff his coat, commenced the task of restoring it to its pristine\r\nsplendor. While doing this, he was startled by a sound so singular that\r\nhis coat nearly fell from his hand, so alarmed was he. Glancing at the\r\ndoor, his eyes met the known form of Ann Harriet, when he instantly\r\nhurried on his coat in horror, and, apologizing to his fair friend for\r\nbeing caught without it, referred to the curious noise he had heard.\r\n\r\n'What did it sound like?' asked Ann Harriet.\r\n\r\nThe Captain tried in vain to find a simile; he had never heard anything\r\nthat resembled it; and Ann Harriet's suggestions as to what it might\r\nhave been were equally fruitless.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that when Miss Hobbs appeared at the threshold of the\r\ndoor she heaved a deep sigh, and it was this that startled her lover;\r\nbut as he had his head in a stooping position, and was busy brushing his\r\ncoat, the sound seemed to him to come from the farther end of the room,\r\nwhich was obscured in darkness. He was not aware that fat ladies' sighs\r\nwere proportionate to their size. However, now that his heart's idol was\r\npresent, he cared nothing for aught else; so, taking her small hand, he\r\nled her to the window, and they stood gazing with mutual consent at the\r\nstarry heavens. Gregory spied them there, and mischievously closed the\r\ndoor. What conversation ensued is only known to the two who were engaged\r\nin it, but every one noticed that when Ann Harriet reappeared her step\r\nwas light if not actually fantastic, and her mild countenance beamed\r\nwith a moonlike radiance, so serenely bright as to reveal a heart\r\nbuoyant with bliss. Soon after, the company dispersed, and the damsel,\r\nretiring to her dormitory, was soon dreaming sweetly of 'her betrothed,'\r\nand imagined that all the bells in Peonytown were rung on her wedding\r\nday.\r\n\r\nSleep on, Ann Harriet! Thou hast waited long for the happy hour; but\r\nthou wert thyself weighty, and it was fit that thou, too, shouldst deal\r\ndeliberately in matters of _'great' weight_.\r\n\r\nThe next day she informed her uncle of her intention to marry the\r\naccomplished Drummond Dobbs, and received his hearty approval; for\r\nDobbs's character was good, and without a scar.\r\n\r\nThe nuptials were to take place without delay, and so Ann Harriet\r\nhastened home to make the requisite arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n   'In wedlock a species of lottery lies,\r\n   Where in blanks and in prizes we deal;\r\n   But how comes it that you, such a capital prize,\r\n   Should so long have remained in the wheel?'\r\n\r\n   MOORE.\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet was determined that her wedding should be a romantic one;\r\nshe said that it was by no means an every-day affair, and therefore it\r\nshould be carried out in a style proportionate to its rarity. After\r\nconsulting Mrs. Pendergast, and searching through a pile of 'New York\r\nDashers,' she was much inclined to a midnight wedding, especially as\r\nMrs. Pendergast offered to loan her patent lamp for the occasion; but\r\nwhen they suddenly happened to hear of a marriage celebrated in the wild\r\nand picturesque woods of the White Hills, it was immediately decided\r\nthat there was no better place; so sacred a ceremony should be performed\r\n'under the broad canopy of heaven,' and the birds of the air and the\r\ncountless leaves of the trees should sing their epithalamium.\r\n\r\nAfter some search, it was decided that the happy spot should be on\r\n'Huckleberry Hill,' a picturesque elevation about a mile from the\r\npostoffice in Peonytown, covered with a luxurious growth of pines and\r\nhemlocks, interspersed with huckleberry bushes, sweet fern, and\r\nmullenstalks. A small, open place was selected, where the long moss made\r\na beautiful carpet, and the tall trees on every side entwined their arms\r\nas lovingly together as if they, too, were about to take each other 'for\r\nbetter for worse,' while the ripple of a brook hidden in the woods lent\r\na pleasant melody to the scene.\r\n\r\n'This is the place of all others,' remarked Ann Harriet. 'Houses may\r\nburn down or decay, churches may be sold and turned into ice-cream\r\nsaloons and lager-beer depots--as Mr. Dunstable's was; but these lofty\r\npines and rugged hemlocks will stand for centuries, to mark the spot\r\nwhere, in my girlhood, I plighted my troth to that _dear_ Dobbs.'\r\n\r\nPreparations for the bridal went gloriously on. The Peonytown dressmaker\r\nwas busy day and evening in making up the trousseau of the expectant\r\nbride. The wedding dress was to be of fine white muslin, and no\r\nornaments to detract from its spotless purity.\r\n\r\nThe important day at length arrived. The sun rose warm, brilliant, calm,\r\nand cloudless--and so did Ann Harriet. Her heart beat quick and\r\ntumultuously as the coming event of the day suddenly occurred to her,\r\nand she rejoiced to think that she was now to have _one_ to shield her\r\nfrom the chilling blasts of a cold, relentless world--a husband on whose\r\nbreast her weary head could rest and feel secure.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts made her footsteps light, and she hastened to array\r\nherself for the bridal, which, was appointed at ten o'clock. The barber\r\nof Peonytown was sent for, and, although dressing a bride's hair was\r\nsomething as yet unknown to him, yet, after much perseverance and more\r\nox marrow, he succeeded in twisting and braiding her luxuriant black\r\nlocks into a kind of triumphal-arched basketwork, that resembled a\r\nminiature summer-house. The white muslin dress was then put on, and a\r\npair of white kid gloves drawn over her small fingers (plump people have\r\nlittle hands), and Ann Harriet awaited her husband elect.\r\n\r\nAll Peonytown had been apprized of the hour of the wedding, and, in\r\nconsequence, the grove was at an early period filled with spectators.\r\nBoys climbed into the trees; camp stools were provided; and one\r\nenterprising Peonytowner brought a long wooden settee, and let the weary\r\nrest on it for the slight consideration of half a dime each. The Rev.\r\nDerby Sifter was there too. He was to perform the ceremony, and, as it\r\nwas the first wedding in Peonytown for six months, he was in unusual\r\nhumor, rubbing his hands together, and laughing at every remark that was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time Ann Harriet appeared, hanging lovingly on the arm\r\nof the gallant Captain. The bride attracted universal attention. At\r\nfirst, indeed, many were impressed with the idea that a crowd of girls\r\nwere coming, dressed in unsullied white; but as she approached nearer,\r\nthey saw that it was the fair Ann Harriet in her white muslin, leaning\r\non the arm of Captain Dobbs, who was dressed in full uniform, and had a\r\ncarnation pink in his mouth. The Rev. Derby Sifter now stepped forward,\r\nand the parties took their places. No bridesmaids were needed, the bride\r\n'answering' for several. After a few preliminary remarks, the reverend\r\ngentleman pronounced them--under green leaves--_husband and wife!_ Ann\r\nHarriet heaved a sigh of relief: the H had vanished forever from her\r\nname, and D now reigned in its stead. A short prayer then followed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a boy in a tree directly over their heads spied a\r\ncaterpillar's nest near him, and, breaking a twig from a branch, he\r\nprobed the nest, causing a tremendous stampede among the inmates. Down\r\nthey dropped, silently and softly, upon the elaborate head of the bride,\r\nwho stood wholly unconscious of the additional ornaments so profusely\r\ndecorating her hair; the company noticed it, and very soon every one was\r\nin a broad grin. Ann Harriet became conscious of some merriment in that\r\nportion of the party immediately under her observation, and a succession\r\nof blushes suffused her face as she felt that something ridiculous to\r\nherself must have caused it. At that instant a caterpillar, that had\r\nbeen swinging to and fro on his attenuated web, landed plump on Ann's\r\nnose as she raised her face (he had been waiting for something to turn\r\nup), causing her to give utterance to a scream that made the clerical\r\ngentleman open his eyes, and a couple of catbirds to fly frightened and\r\nsquealing from their nests.\r\n\r\nAt the same time an angry cow, rendered furious by the sting of some\r\ninsect, plunged frantically into the wedding circle, bellowing, tossing\r\nher head, and flourishing her tail in a terrific and antinuptial manner.\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Sifter was the first one to leave, and, being very spare,\r\nhe passed swiftly through the trees and bushes, never looking behind him\r\ntill he had reached the meeting house, where he stopped and in his\r\nunconscious delirium caught at the bell rope and rang the bell with a\r\nvigor that started every one from his work, so that in a few minutes\r\n'Extinguisher No. 1' was hurried along the roads by an extempore company\r\nof about fifty men and boys.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the witnesses of the rural wedding had all skedaddled--to\r\nborrow a Greek word--into the woods, in dire confusion, tearing\r\ndresses, pulling down 'back hair,' hitching hoop skirts, and tumbling\r\nover blackberry vines--but each intent on increasing the distance from\r\nthe mad cow. Ann Harriet was not so fortunate; her size prevented her\r\nrunning, and a fiery peony on her bosom attracted the animal's\r\nattention, so that, with a loud roar, the beast rushed directly upon\r\nher. Had Ann Harriet been--as she was a few weeks before--an unprotected\r\nfemale, the undertaker of Peonytown would have had a 'big job' that day;\r\nbut luckily, he who had just sworn to love and protect her saw that now\r\nwas his time and chance to begin; so, drawing his sword, he stepped in\r\nfront of his trembling bride, and, as the cow approached with head down\r\nand eyeballs glaring wildly, he aimed a blow with his weapon, which\r\ninflicted a severe cut on her nose.\r\n\r\nThe cow paused.\r\n\r\n'Step backward gradually, my Ann Harriet,' said the valiant Dobbs, 'and\r\nI will see that she does not touch you.'\r\n\r\nAnn Harriet stepped backward, but not 'gradually,' for she trod on a\r\nloose stone, which upset her, and she rolled over and over down a\r\nsloping rock, ruining, on the way, any quantity of huckleberry bushes\r\nand pennyroyal. This started the cow, who made another furious charge at\r\nthe soldier, who this time, by a well-directed blow, cut one horn sheer\r\noff.\r\n\r\n'That's good!' exclaimed he; 'next time I'll take t'other horn, and then\r\ncommence on her legs.'\r\n\r\nThe cow made another retreat, but appeared by no means vanquished. The\r\nCaptain stood his ground manfully. Ann Harriet sat on the moss at the\r\nfoot of the rock, disentangling from her hair the bruised and mangled\r\ncaterpillars which still remained there.\r\n\r\nJust as the cow was about to make her third charge, shouts were heard in\r\nthe path which led to the village, and in a moment 'Extinguisher No. 1,'\r\nwith its brave volunteers, was on the ground. They had followed the\r\ndirections of the parson and arrived at an opportune moment.\r\n\r\nThe boys at once decided that, as there was no fire to put out, they\r\nwould 'put out' the cow; so, unreeling the hose, they drew the water\r\nfrom the brook, and in a very little while a stream of water from a\r\ntwo-inch pipe struck the astonished cow full in the face, when she\r\nturned and scampered off into the forest, jumping over Ann Harriet at a\r\nsingle bound, and was seen no more.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dobbs wiped his gory weapon on the greensward, and returned it\r\nto the sheath. He then sprang to the side of his wife, and, with the\r\nhelp of the foreman and two brakemen, raised her. She said her nerves\r\nwere all unstrung, and she 'never could walk home in the world;' so she\r\nwas placed on the box of the hose carriage and carried to the village.\r\n\r\nThe Peonytowners turned out _en masse_ to meet them, and were anxious\r\nthat the heroic Captain should make a speech from the town pump; but he\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the happy couple were comfortably seated on the sofa in\r\nthe parlor of the old homestead, and his arm was as far round her waist\r\nas it would go. Here we will bid them adieu. Ann Harriet being married,\r\nshe will have no more _miss_-haps--albeit at some future time something\r\nmay be heard of Captain and Mrs. Dobbs--and all the little Dobbses.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Broken-up apple pie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNION.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe census tables of the North and the South, and especially of\r\nMassachusetts, Maryland, and South Carolina, heretofore presented, have\r\nproved that slavery greatly retarded the progress of population, wealth,\r\nscience, education, and religion. The comparison now instituted between\r\nNew York and Virginia demonstrates the same law.\r\n\r\nBy the census, the population of Virginia in 1790 was 748,308, and in\r\n1860, 1,596,318, making the ratio of increase 113.32 percent. In 1790,\r\nNew York numbered 340,120, and in 1860, 3,880,735, the ratio of increase\r\nbeing 1,040.99. (Table 1, Prelim. Census Rep., p. 132.) Thus, the rate\r\nof increase in New York exceeded that of Virginia more than nine to one.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, the population of Virginia was largely more than double that of\r\nNew York. In 1860, the population of New York was very largely more than\r\ndouble that of Virginia. In 1790, Virginia, in population, ranked first\r\nof all the States, and New York the fifth. In 1860, they had reversed\r\ntheir positions, and New York was the first, and Virginia the fifth.\r\n(Rep., p. 120.) At the same rate of progress, from 1860 to 1900, as from\r\n1790 to 1860, Virginia, retaining slavery, would have sunk from the\r\nfirst to the twenty-first State, and would still continue, at each\r\nsucceeding decade, descending the inclined plane toward the lowest\r\nposition of all the States. Such has been, and still continues to be,\r\nthe effect of slavery, in dragging down that once great State from the\r\nfirst toward the last in rank in the Union. But if, as in the absence of\r\nslavery must have been the case, Virginia had increased from 1790 to\r\n1860 in the same ratio as New York, her population in 1860 would have\r\nbeen 7,789,141, and she must always have remained the first in rank of\r\nall the States.\r\n\r\nAREA.--The natural advantages of Virginia far exceed those of New York.\r\nThe area of Virginia is 61,352 square miles, and that of New York,\r\n47,000. The population of Virginia per square mile in 1790 was 12.19,\r\nand in 1860, 26.02. That of New York, in 1790, was 7.83, and in 1860,\r\n84.36. Now, if New York, with her present numbers per square mile, had\r\nthe area of Virginia, her population, in 1860, would have been\r\n5,175,654, and that of Virginia, reduced to the area of New York, on the\r\nbasis of her present numbers per square mile, would have been 1,320,000.\r\nThis illustrates the immense effect of area, as one of the great\r\nelements influencing the progress of population. But, wonderful as are\r\nthese results, the great fact is omitted in this calculation, that\r\nVirginia, in 1790, had largely more than double the population of New\r\nYork. Thus, if we reverse the numbers of New York and Virginia in 1790,\r\nand take the actual ratio of increase of each for the succeeding seventy\r\nyears, the population of Virginia, in 1860, would have been 728,875, and\r\nthat of New York, as we have seen, would have been 7,789,141, making the\r\ndifference exceed seven millions, or very largely more than ten to one.\r\nReverse the areas also, and the difference would exceed eight millions.\r\n\r\nSHORE LINE.--As furnishing cheap and easy access for imports and\r\nexports, creating marts for commerce with great cities, and affecting\r\nthe interior most beneficially, the shore line, with adequate harbors,\r\nconstitutes a vast element in the progress of states and empires. Now,\r\nby the last tables of the United States coast survey, the shore line of\r\nVirginia was 1,571 miles, and of New York 725 miles. The five great\r\nparallel tide-water rivers of Virginia, the Potomac, the Rappahannock,\r\nthe York river, James river, and Roanoke (partly in North Carolina),\r\nwith their tributaries, furnish easy access for hundreds of miles into\r\nthe interior, with both shores of the noble Chesapeake bay for many\r\nmiles, as well as its magnificent outlet and the main ocean for a\r\nconsiderable distance, all within the limits of Virginia. We have seen\r\nthat the coast line of Virginia is largely more than double that of New\r\nYork, and the harbors of Virginia are more numerous, deeper, and much\r\nnearer the great valley of the Ohio and Mississippi. By the coast-survey\r\ntables, the mean low water into the harbor of New York by Gedney's\r\nchannel is 20 feet, and at high-water spring tides is 24.2; north\r\nchannel, 24, mean low water, and 29.1 spring tides, high water; south\r\nchannel, 22 and 27.1; main ship channel, after passing S.W. spit buoy,\r\non N.E. course, one mile up the bay, for New York, 22.5-27.06. By the\r\nsame tables, from capes at entrance of Chesapeake bay to Hampton, at\r\nmean low water, 30 feet; spring tides, high water, 32.8. Anchorage in\r\nHampton roads, 59-61.8. From Hampton roads to Sewell's point, 25-27.8.\r\nSouth of Sewell's point (one mile and a half), 21-23.8; up to Norfolk,\r\n23-25.8. From Hampton roads to James river, entering to the northward of\r\nNewport News, middle ground, 22-24.8. From Hampton roads to James river,\r\nentering to the southward of Newport News, middle ground, 27-29.8. From\r\nabreast the tail of York spit, up to Yorktown, 33-35.8. Elizabeth river,\r\nbetween Norfolk and navy yard, 25.5-28.3.\r\n\r\nWhen we leave the tide-water rivers for the interior navigable streams,\r\nVirginia has a vast advantage. New York has no such rivers above tide,\r\nbut Virginia has the Ohio for hundreds of miles, with its tributaries,\r\nthe Kanawha, Guyandotte, and Big Sandy. It is true, New York has several\r\nof the great lakes, and the vast advantage of connection with them\r\nthrough her great canal. But, in the absence of slavery, the canal\r\nprojected by Washington (preceding that of New York) would have\r\nconnected, through Virginia, the Chesapeake bay with the Ohio river. The\r\nJames river, flowing into the Chesapeake, cuts the Blue Mountains, and\r\nthe Kanawha, a confluent of the Ohio, cuts the Alleghany; thus opening\r\nan easy and practicable route for a great canal from the eastern to the\r\nwestern waters. The valley of the lakes, with which New York is\r\nconnected by her canal, has an area of 335,515 square miles. The valley\r\nof the Mississippi, with which the Chesapeake would long since, in the\r\nabsence of slavery, have been connected by the Virginia canal, has an\r\narea of 1,226,600 square miles. The shore line of the Mississippi and\r\nits tributaries, above tide water, is 35,644 miles. (Page 35 Compend.\r\nCensus of 1850.) Our shore line of the lakes is 3,620 miles, including\r\nbays, sounds, and islands; and that of the British, 2,629. (Ib. 35.) The\r\nconnection of the lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi would be the same\r\nfor both States, the one being from the lakes to these rivers, and the\r\nother from the rivers to the lakes. The location of Virginia is more\r\ncentral than that of New York, and Virginia runs farther west by several\r\nhundred miles. We are so accustomed to look at the connection of New\r\nYork with the West by her canal, and Virginia with no such union, that\r\nit is difficult to realize the great change if Virginia had been\r\nconnected by her progressing work with the Ohio and Mississippi, and\r\nthence, by the present canals, with the lakes.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, then, that, as regards easy access to the West, the\r\nnatural advantages of Virginia surpass New York, and with greater\r\nfacilities for artificial works. How many decades would be required,\r\nafter emancipation, to bring the superior natural advantages of Virginia\r\ninto practical operation, is not the question; nor do I believe that\r\nthe city of New York will ever cease to be the centre of our own trade,\r\nand ultimately of the commerce of the world. But although Virginia, in\r\nadhering to slavery, has lost her supremacy in the Union, it is quite\r\ncertain that, as a Free State, she would commence a new career of\r\nwonderful prosperity, that capital and population from the North and\r\nfrom Europe would flow there with a mighty current, her lands be doubled\r\nin value, and her town and city property far more than quadrupled.\r\n\r\nMINES.--Virginia has vast mines of coal, the great element of modern\r\nprogress. New York has none. It is coal that has made Great Britain a\r\nmighty empire, giving her power, by land and sea, equal to the manual\r\nforce of all mankind. It is stated by the Commissioner of the General\r\nLand Office, in his report before referred to, of November, 1860, 'that\r\nan acre of coal, three feet thick, is equal to the product of 1,940\r\nacres of forest trees; and each acre of a coal seam four feet in\r\nthickness, and yielding one yard of pure coal, is equivalent to 5,000\r\ntons, and possesses, therefore, a reserve of mechanical strength in its\r\nfuel, equal to the life labor of more than 1,600 men.'\r\n\r\nThis statement of the Commissioner is made on the highest authority, and\r\nproves the vast natural advantages of Virginia over New York. Virginia,\r\nalso, has far more abundant mines of iron, more widely diffused over the\r\nState, reaching from tide water to the Ohio. She has also these iron\r\nmines in juxtaposition with coal and all the fluxes. Virginia, also, has\r\nvaluable mines of gold, lead, and copper. New York has no gold or copper\r\nmines, and produced in 1860 but $800 worth of lead. (Table 14.)\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIC POWER.--Omitting Niagara, which thus far scorns the control of\r\nman, the hydraulic power of Virginia very far exceeds that of New York.\r\nIt is to be found on the Potomac and its tributaries, and upon nearly\r\nevery stream that flows into the Chesapeake or Ohio. The superior\r\nmildness of the climate of Virginia makes this power available there for\r\na much greater portion of the year. The great falls of the Potomac,\r\nwhere Washington constructed the largest locks of the continent, has a\r\nwater power unsurpassed, and is but twelve miles from tide water, at\r\nWashington. This point is a most healthy and beautiful location,\r\nsurrounded by lands whose natural fertility was very great, and, in the\r\nabsence of slavery, must have been a vast manufacturing city. This water\r\npower could move more spindles than are now worked on all this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURES.--The natural fertility of the soil of\r\nVirginia far exceeded that of New York, with a more genial sun, and much\r\nmore favorable seasons for agricultural products, as well as for stock.\r\nThe number of acres of land in Virginia susceptible of profitable\r\nculture, is nearly double that of New York, but much of it has been\r\nimpoverished by slave labor, scratching and exhausting the soil, without\r\nmanure or rotation of crops. The census shows that Virginia has all the\r\nproducts of New York, and cotton in addition. Virginia produced, in\r\n1860, 12,727 bales of cotton (table 36), worth, at present prices,\r\nnearly $3,000,000. She also adjoins the States of North Carolina and\r\nTennessee, producing, in 1860, 372,964 bales, worth, at present prices,\r\nnearly $90,000,000. Virginia is also much nearer than New York to all\r\nthe other cotton States. With these vast advantages, with her larger\r\narea, more fertile soil, cheaper subsistence, her coal and iron and\r\ngreat hydraulic power, with so much cotton raised by herself and in\r\nadjacent States, Virginia should have manufactured much more cotton than\r\nNew York. But, by the census (table 22), the value of the cotton\r\nmanufacture of Virginia in 1850 was $1,446,109, and in 1860,\r\n$1,063,611--a decrease of one third. In New York, the value of the\r\ncotton manufacture in 1850 was $5,019,323, and in 1860, $7,471,961, an\r\nincrease of over 48 per cent. So, if we look at the tables of mines,\r\nmanufactures, and the fisheries, with the vastly superior advantages of\r\nVirginia, the whole product in 1860 was of the value of $51,300,000, and\r\nof agriculture $68,700,000; whilst in New York these values were\r\nrespectively $379,623,560 and $226,376,440. (Tables of Census, 33 and\r\n36.)\r\n\r\nCLIMATE AND MORTALITY.--By table 6, page 22, of the Census, there were\r\nfor the year ending June 1st, 1860, 46,881 deaths in New York, being 1\r\nin every 82 of the population, and 1.22 per cent. The number of deaths\r\nin Virginia, in the same year, was 22,472, being 1 in every 70 of the\r\npopulation, or 1.43 per cent. There was, then, a slight difference in\r\nfavor of New York. But Virginia is divided into four geographical\r\nsections: the tide-water, the Piedmont (running from the tide-water\r\nregion to the Blue Mountains), the valley between these mountains and\r\nthe Alleghanies, and the trans-Alleghany to the Ohio. These three last\r\nsections, containing three fourths of the area and white population of\r\nthe State, surpass New York in salubrity, with the most bracing and\r\ndelightful climate. The climate of Virginia is far more favorable for\r\nstock and agricultural products than New York, with longer and better\r\nseasons, and is more salubrious than the climate of Europe. (Comp.\r\n1850.)\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF WEALTH.--We have seen how great was the advance in\r\npopulation of New York over Virginia, from 1790 to 1860, being in the\r\nratio of more than 9 to 1. Now let us compare the relative progress of\r\nwealth. It is contended by the advocates of slavery, that it accumulates\r\nwealth more rapidly, and thus enriches the nation, although it may\r\ndepress its moral and intellectual development, its increase of numbers\r\nand of power, and tarnish its reputation throughout the world. As\r\npopulation and its labor create wealth, it must be retarded by a system\r\nwhich, as we have seen in this case, diminishes the relative advance of\r\nnumbers in the ratio of more than 9 to 1. But the census proves that\r\nslavery greatly retards the increase of wealth. By tables 33 and 36 of\r\nthe census of 1860, it appears, omitting commerce, that the products of\r\nindustry, as given, viz., of agriculture, manufactures, mines, and\r\nfisheries, were that year in New York $604,000,000, or $155 _per\r\ncapita_; and in Virginia $120,000,000, or $75 _per capita_. This shows a\r\ntotal value of product in New York more than five times greater than in\r\nVirginia, and _per capita_, more than 2 to 1. If we include the earnings\r\nof commerce, and all business not given in the census, I think it will\r\nbe shown hereafter, that the value of the products and earnings of New\r\nYork, in 1860, exceeded those of Virginia at least 7 to 1. As to the\r\nrate of increase, the value of the products of agriculture,\r\nmanufactures, mines, and fisheries of Virginia, in 1850, was $84,480,428\r\n(table 9), and in New York $356,736,603, showing an increase in Virginia\r\nfrom 1850 to 1860 of $35,519,572, being 41 per cent., and in New York\r\n$247,263,397, being 69 per cent., exhibiting a difference of 28 per\r\ncent. Now the increase of population in Virginia from 1850 to 1860 was\r\n12.29 per cent., and in New York 25.29 per cent., the difference being\r\nonly 13 per cent. (Table 1, p. 131.) Thus, it appears, the increase of\r\nwealth in New York, exclusive of the gains of commerce, as compared with\r\nVirginia, was more than double the ratio of the augmentation of\r\npopulation. By the census table of 1860, No. 35, p. 195, 'The true value\r\nof the real and personal property, according to the eighth census was,\r\nNew York, $1,843,338,517, and of Virginia $793,249,681.' Now we have\r\nseen the value of the products of New York in 1860 by the census was\r\n$604,000,000, and in Virginia $120,000,000. Thus, as a question of the\r\nannual yield of capital, that of New York was 32.82 per cent., and\r\nVirginia 15.13 per cent.; the annual product of capital being more than\r\ndouble in New York what it was in Virginia. The problem then is solved\r\nin Virginia, as it was in Maryland and South Carolina, and all the South\r\ncompared with all the North, that slavery retards the progress of wealth\r\nand accumulation of capital, in the ratio of 2 to 1. Our war taxes may\r\nbe very great, but the tax of slavery is far greater, and the relief\r\nfrom it, in a few years, will add much more to the national wealth than\r\nthe whole deduction made by the war debt. Our total wealth, by the\r\ncensus of 1860, being, by table 35, $16,159,616,068, one per cent. taken\r\nannually to pay the interest and gradually extinguish the war debt,\r\nwould be $161,596,160; whereas, judging by Virginia and New York, the\r\ndiminished increase of the annual product of capital, as the result of\r\nslavery, is 2.8 per cent., or $452,469,250 per annum, equal in a decade,\r\nwithout compounding the annual results, to $4,524,692,500.\r\n\r\nThat our population would have reached in 1860 nearly 40,000,000, and\r\nour wealth have been more than doubled, if slavery had been extinguished\r\nin 1790, is one of the revelations made by the census; whilst in\r\nscience, in education, and national power, the advance would have been\r\nstill more rapid, and the moral force of our example and success would\r\nhave controlled for the benefit of mankind the institutions of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBy table 36, p. 196, of the census of 1860, the _cash_ value of the\r\nfarms of Virginia was $371,096,211, being $11.91 per acre, and of New\r\nYork $803,343,593, being $38.26 per acre. Now, by the table, the number\r\nof acres embraced in these farms of New York was 20,992,950, and in\r\nVirginia 31,014,950, the difference of value per acre being $26.36, or\r\nmuch more than 3 to 1 in favor of New York. Now, if we multiply this\r\nnumber of acres of farm lands of Virginia by the New York value, it\r\nwould make the total value of the farm lands of New York $1,186,942,136,\r\nand the _additional_ value caused by emancipation $815,845,925. Now the\r\nwhole number of slaves in Virginia in 1860, was 490,865; multiplying\r\nwhich by $300 as their average value, would be $147,259,500, leaving\r\n$668,586,425 as the sum by which Virginia would be richer in farms\r\nalone, if slavery were abolished. But, stupendous as is this result in\r\nregard to lands, it is far below the reality. We have seen that the farm\r\nlands of Virginia, improved and unimproved, constituted 31,014,950\r\nacres. By the census and the land-office tables, the area of Virginia is\r\n39,265,280 acres. Deduct the farm lands, and there remain unoccupied\r\n8,250,330 acres. Now, Virginia's population to the square mile being\r\n26.02, and that of New York 84.36, with an equal density in Virginia,\r\nmore than two thirds of these Virginia lands, as in New York, must have\r\nbeen occupied as farms. This would have been equivalent, at two thirds,\r\nto 5,500,000 acres, which, at their present average value of $2 per\r\nacre, would be worth $11,000,000; but, at the value per acre of the New\r\nYork lands, these 5,500,000 acres would be worth $206,430,000. Deduct\r\nfrom this their present value, $11,000,000, and the remainder,\r\n$195,430,000, is the sum by which the unoccupied lands of Virginia,\r\nconverted into farms, would have been increased in value by\r\nemancipation. Add this to the enhanced value of their present farms,\r\n$815,845,925, and the result would be $1,011,275,925, as the gain of\r\nVirginia in the value of lands by emancipation. To these we should add,\r\nfrom the same cause, the enhancement of the town and city property in\r\nVirginia to the extent of several hundred millions of dollars. In order\r\nto realize the truth, we must behold Virginia as she would have been,\r\nwith New York railroads and canals, farms, manufactures, commerce,\r\ntowns, and cities. Then we must consider the superior natural advantages\r\nof Virginia, her far greater area, her richer soil, her more genial sun,\r\nher greater variety of products, her mines of coal, iron, gold, copper,\r\nand lead, her petroleum, her superior hydraulic power, her much larger\r\ncoast line, with more numerous and deeper harbors--and reflect what\r\nVirginia would have been in the absence of slavery. Her early statesmen,\r\nWashington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Mason, Tucker, and Marshall, all\r\nrealized this great truth, and all desired to promote emancipation in\r\nVirginia. But their advice was disregarded by her present leaders--the\r\nnew, false, and fatal dogmas of Calhoun were substituted; and, as a\r\nconsequence, Virginia, from the first rank (_longo intervallo_) of all\r\nthe States, has fallen to the fifth, and, with slavery continued, will\r\ndescend still more rapidly in the future than in the past. Let her\r\nabolish slavery, and she will commence a new career of progress. Freedom\r\nand its associates, education and energy, will occupy her waste lands,\r\nrestore her exhausted fields, decaying cities, and prostrate industry,\r\nemploy her vast hydraulic power, develop her mines, unite by her grand\r\ncanals the waters of the Chesapeake and Ohio, and, placing her feet upon\r\nslavery, hear her proclaim, in the proud language of her own State\r\nmotto, '_Sic semper tyrannis._'\r\n\r\nBy census table 36, p. 197, the value, in 1860, of the farm lands of all\r\nthe Slave States, was $2,570,466,935, and the number of acres\r\n245,721,062, worth $10.46 per acre. In the Free States, the value of the\r\nfarm lands was $4,067,947,286, and the number of acres 161,462,008,\r\nworth $25.19 per acre. Now if, as certainly in the absence of slavery\r\nwould have been the case, the farm lands of the South had been worth as\r\nmuch per acre as those of the North, their total value would have been\r\n$6,189,713,551, and, deducting the present price, the _additional_ cash\r\nvalue would have been $3,619,346,616. Now the whole number of slaves in\r\nall the States, in 1860, was 3,950,531, multiplying which by $300, as\r\ntheir average value, would make all the slaves in the Union worth\r\n$1,185,159,300. Deduct this from the enhanced value of the farm lands of\r\nthe South as above, and the result would be $2,434,087,316 as the gain\r\nin the price of farms by emancipation. This is independent of the\r\nincreased value of their unoccupied lands, and of their town and city\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nBy census tables of 1860, 33 and 36, the total value of the products of\r\nagriculture, mines, and fisheries in the Free States was $4,100,000,000,\r\nand of the Slave States $1,150,000,000, making the products of the Free\r\nStates in 1860 nearly 4 to 1 of the Slave States, and $216 _per capita_\r\nfor the Free States, and for the Slave States $94 _per capita_. This is\r\nexclusive of commerce, which would greatly increase the ratio in favor\r\nof the North, that of New York alone being nearly equal to that of all\r\nthe Slave States. Now, multiply the population of the Slave States by\r\nthe value of the products _per capita_ of the Free States, and the\r\nresult is $2,641,631,032, making, by emancipation, the increased annual\r\nproduct of the Slave States $1,491,631,032, and in ten years, exclusive\r\nof the yearly accumulations, $14,916,310,320.\r\n\r\nBy the table 35, census of 1860, the total value of all the property,\r\nreal and personal, of the Free States, was $10,852,081,681, and of the\r\nSlave States, $5,225,307,034. Now, the product, in 1860, of the Free\r\nStates, being $4,100,000,000, the annual yield on the capital was 38 per\r\ncent.; and, the product of the Slave States being $1,150,000,000, the\r\nyield on the capital was 22 per cent. This was the gross product in both\r\ncases. I have worked out these amazing results from the census tables,\r\nto illustrate the fact, that the same law, by which slavery retarded the\r\nprogress of wealth in Virginia, as compared with New York, and of\r\nMaryland and South Carolina, as compared with Massachusetts, rules the\r\nrelative advance in wealth of all the Slave States, as compared with\r\nthat of all the Free States. I have stated that the statistics of\r\ncommerce, omitted in these tables, would vastly increase the difference\r\nin favor of the Free States, as compared with the Slave States, and of\r\nNew York as contrasted with Virginia. I shall now resume the latter\r\ninquiry, so as to complete the comparison between New York and Virginia.\r\nBy commerce is embraced, in this examination, all earning not included\r\nunder the heads of agriculture, manufactures, the mines, or fisheries.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS.--The number of miles of railroads in operation in New York,\r\nin 1860, including city roads, was 2,842 miles, costing $138,395,055;\r\nand in Virginia, 1,771 miles, costing $64,958,807. (Census table of\r\n1860, No. 38, pp. 230 and 233.) Now, by the same census report, p. 105,\r\nthe value of the freights of the New York roads for 1860 was as follows:\r\nProduct of the forest--tons carried, 373,424; value per ton, $20; total\r\nvalue, $7,468,480. Of animals--895,519 tons; value per ton, $200; total\r\nvalue, $179,103,800. Vegetable food--1,103,640 tons; value per ton, $50;\r\ntotal value, $55,182,000. Other agricultural products--143,219 tons;\r\nvalue per ton, $15; total value, $2,148,055. Manufactures--511,916 tons;\r\nvalue per ton, $500; total value, $391,905,500. Other articles--930,244\r\ntons; value, $10 per ton; total value, $9,302,440. Grand total,\r\n4,741,773 tons carried; value per ton, $163. Total values, $773,089,275.\r\nDeducting one quarter for duplication, makes 3,556,330 tons carried on\r\nthe New York roads in 1860; and the value, $579,681,790. The values of\r\nthe freights on the Virginia roads, as estimated, is $60,000,000, giving\r\nan excess to those of New York of $519,681,790, on the value of railroad\r\nfreights in 1860. The passenger account, not given, would largely\r\nincrease the disparity in favor of New York.\r\n\r\nCANALS.--The number of miles of canals in New York is 1,038, and their\r\ncost $67,567,972. In Virginia, the number of miles is 178, and the cost\r\n$7,817,000. (Census table 39, p. 238.) The estimated value of the\r\nfreight on the New York canals is 19 times that of the freight on the\r\nVirginia canals. (Census.)\r\n\r\nTONNAGE.--The tonnage of vessels built in New York in 1860 was 31,936\r\ntons, and in Virginia 4,372. (Census, p. 107.)\r\n\r\nBANKS.--The number of banks in New York in 1860 was 303; capital\r\n$111,441,320, loans $200,351,332, specie $20,921,545, circulation\r\n$29,959,506, deposits $101,070,273; and in Virginia the number was 65;\r\ncapital $16,005,156, loans $24,975,792, specie $2,943,652, circulation\r\n$9,812,197, deposits $7,729,652. (Table 34, p. 193, Census.)\r\n\r\nINSURANCE COMPANIES.--The risks taken in New York were $916,474,956, or\r\nnearly one third of those in the whole Union. Virginia, estimated at\r\n$100,000,000; difference in favor of New York $816,474,956. (Census, p.\r\n79.)\r\n\r\nEXPORTS AND IMPORTS, ETC.--Our exports abroad from New York for the\r\nfiscal year ending 30th June, 1860, were $145,555,449, and the foreign\r\nimports $248,489,877; total of both, $394,045,326. The clearances same\r\nyear from New York were 4,574,285 tons, and the entries 4,836,448 tons;\r\ntotal of both, 9,410,733 tons. In Virginia, the exports the same year\r\nwere $5,858,024, and the imports $1,326,249; total of both, $7,184,273;\r\nclearances, 80,381 tons, entries, 97,762 tons; total of both, 178,143\r\ntons. (Table 14, Register of United States Treasury.) Revenue collected\r\nfrom customs same year in New York, $37,788,969, and in Virginia\r\n$189,816, or 200 to 1 in favor of New York. (Tables, U.S. Com. of\r\nCustoms.) No returns are given for the coastwise and internal trade of\r\neither State, but the tables of the railway and canal transportation of\r\nboth States show nearly the same proportion in favor of New York as in\r\nthe foreign trade. Thus the _domestic_ exports from New York for the\r\nabove year abroad were $126,060,967, and from Virginia $5,833,371.\r\n(Same table, 14.) And yet Virginia, as we have seen, had much greater\r\nnatural advantages than New York for commerce, as well as for mines,\r\nmanufactures, and agriculture. But slavery has almost expelled commerce\r\nfrom Virginia, and nearly paralyzed all other pursuits.\r\n\r\nThese tables, taken from the census and the Treasury records, prove\r\nincontestably, that slavery retards the progress of wealth and\r\npopulation throughout the South, but especially in Virginia. Nor can the\r\nTariff account for the results; for Virginia, as we have seen, possesses\r\nfar greater advantages than New York for manufactures. Besides, the\r\ncommerce of New York far surpasses that of Virginia, and this is the\r\nbranch of industry supposed to be affected most injuriously by high\r\ntariffs, and New York has generally voted against them with as much\r\nunanimity as Virginia. But there is a still more conclusive proof. The\r\nyear 1824 was the commencement of the era of high tariffs, and yet, from\r\n1790 to 1820, as proved by the census, the percentage of increase of New\r\nYork over Virginia was greater than from 1820 to 1860. Thus, by table I\r\nof the census, p. 124, the increase of population in Virginia was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   From 1790 to 1800 17.63 per cent.\r\n     \"  1800 \"  1810 10.73    \"\r\n     \"  1810 \"  1820  9.31    \"\r\n     \"  1820 \"  1830 13.71    \"\r\n     \"  1830 \"  1840  2.34    \"\r\n     \"  1840 \"  1850 14.60    \"\r\n     \"  1850 \"  1860 12.29    \"\r\n\r\nThe increase of population in New York was:\r\n\r\n   From 1790 to 1800 72.51 per cent.\r\n     \"  1800 \"  1810 63.45    \"\r\n     \"  1810 \"  1820 43.14    \"\r\n     \"  1820 \"  1830 39.76    \"\r\n     \"  1830 \"  1840 26.60    \"\r\n     \"  1840 \"  1850 27.52    \"\r\n     \"  1850 \"  1860 25.29    \"\r\n\r\nIn 1790 the population of Virginia was 748,318, in 1820, 1,065,129, and\r\nin 1860, 1,596,318. In 1790 the population of New York was 340,120, in\r\n1820, 1,372,111, and in 1860, 3,880,735. Thus, from 1790 to 1820, before\r\nthe inauguration of the protective policy, the relative increase of the\r\npopulation of New York, as compared with Virginia, was very far greater\r\nthan from 1820 to 1860. It is quite clear, then, that the Tariff had no\r\ninfluence whatever in depressing the progress of Virginia as compared\r\nwith New York.\r\n\r\nWe have heretofore proved by the census the same position as regards the\r\nrelative progress of Maryland and Massachusetts, and the same principle\r\napplies as between all the Free, as compared with all the Slave States.\r\nIn New York, we have seen that her progress from 1790 to 1820, in the\r\nabsence of high tariffs, and, even before the completion of her great\r\ncanal, her advance in population was much more rapid than from 1820 to\r\n1860. Indeed, it is quite clear that, so far as the Tariff had any\r\ninfluence, it was far more unfavorable to New York than to Virginia, New\r\nYork being a much greater agricultural as well as commercial State.\r\n\r\nHaving shown how much the material progress of Virginia has been\r\nretarded by slavery, let us now consider its effect upon her moral and\r\nintellectual development.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS.--The number of newspapers and periodicals in\r\nNew York in 1860 was 542, of which 365 were political, 56 religious, 63\r\nliterary, 58 miscellaneous; and the number of copies circulated in 1860\r\nwas 320,930,884. (Census tables, Nos. 15, 37.) The number in Virginia\r\nwas 139; of which 117 were political, 13 religious, 3 literary, 6\r\nmiscellaneous; and the number of copies circulated in 1860 was\r\n26,772,568. Thus, the annual circulation of the press in New York was\r\ntwelve times as great as that of Virginia. As to periodicals: New York\r\nhad 69 monthlies, of which 2 were political, 25 religious, 24 literary,\r\nand 18 miscellaneous; 10 quarterlies, of which 5 were religious, and 5\r\nliterary; 6 annuals, of which 2 were political, 2 religious, and 2\r\nmiscellaneous. Virginia had 5 monthlies, of which 1 was political, 2\r\nreligious, 1 literary, and 1 miscellaneous; and no quarterlies or\r\nannuals. The annual circulation of the New York monthlies was 2,045,000;\r\nthat of Virginia was 43,900; or more than 43 to 1 in favor of New York.\r\n\r\nAs regards schools, colleges, academies, libraries, and churches, I must\r\ntake the census of 1850, those tables for 1860 not being yet arranged\r\nand printed. The number of public schools in New York in 1850 was\r\n11,580, teachers 13,965, pupils 675,221; colleges, academies, etc.,\r\npupils 52,001; attending school during the year, as returned by\r\nfamilies, 693,329; native adults of the State who cannot read or write,\r\n23,341. Public libraries, 11,013; volumes, 1,760,820. Value of churches,\r\n$21,539,561. (Comp. Census, 1850.)\r\n\r\nThe number of public schools in Virginia in 1850 was 2,937, teachers\r\n3,005, pupils 67,438; colleges, academies, etc., pupils 10,326;\r\nattending school during the year, as returned by families, 109,775;\r\nnative white adults of the State who cannot read or write, 75,868.\r\nPublic libraries, 54; volumes, 88,462. Value of churches, $2,902,220.\r\n(Compend. of Census of 1850.) By table 155, same compend, the percentage\r\nof native free population in Virginia over 20 years of age who cannot\r\nread or write is 19.90, and in New York 1.87, in North Carolina 30.34,\r\nin Maryland 11.10, in Massachusetts 0.32, or less than one third of one\r\nper cent. In New England, the percentage of native whites who cannot\r\nread or write is 0.42, or less than one half of one per cent.; and in\r\nthe Southern States 20.30, or 50 to 1 in favor of New England.\r\n(Compend., table 157.) But, if we take the whole adult population of\r\nVirginia, including whites, free blacks, and slaves, 42.05 per cent., or\r\nnearly one half, cannot read or write; and in North Carolina, more than\r\none half cannot read or write. We have seen, by the above official\r\ntables of the census of 1850, that New York, compared with Virginia, had\r\nnearly ten times as many pupils at schools, colleges, and academies,\r\ntwenty times as many books in libraries, and largely more than seven\r\ntimes the value of churches; while the ratio of native white adults who\r\ncannot read or write was more than 10 to 1 in Virginia, compared with\r\nNew York. We have seen, also, that in North Carolina nearly one third of\r\nthe native white adults, and in Virginia nearly one fifth, cannot read\r\nor write, and in New England 1 in every 400, in New York 1 in every 131,\r\nin the South and Southwest 1 in every 12 of the native white adults.\r\n(Comp. p. 153.)\r\n\r\nThese official statistics enable me, then, again to say that slavery is\r\nhostile to the progress of wealth and education, to science and\r\nliterature, to schools, colleges, and universities, to books and\r\nlibraries, to churches and religion, to the press, and therefore to free\r\ngovernment; hostile to the poor, keeping them in want and ignorance;\r\nhostile to labor, reducing it to servitude, and decreasing two thirds\r\nthe value of its products; hostile to morals, repudiating among slaves\r\nthe marital and parental condition, classifying them by law as chattels,\r\ndarkening the immortal soul, and making it a crime to teach millions of\r\nhuman beings to read or write. Surely such a system is hostile to\r\ncivilization, which consists in the education of the masses of the\r\npeople of a country, and not of the few only. A State, one third of\r\nwhose population are slaves, classified by law as chattels, and\r\nforbidden all instruction, and nearly one fifth of whose adult whites\r\ncannot read or write, is semi-civilized, however enlightened may be the\r\nruling classes. If a highly educated chief or parliament governed China\r\nor Dahomey, they would still be semi-civilized or barbarous countries,\r\nhowever enlightened their rulers might be. The real discord between the\r\nNorth and the South, is not only the difference between freedom and\r\nslavery, but between civilization and barbarism caused by slavery. When\r\nwe speak of a civilized _nation_, we mean the masses of the people, and\r\nnot the government or rulers only. The enlightenment of the _people_ is\r\nthe true criterion of civilization, and any community that falls below\r\nthis standard, is barbarous or semi-civilized. In countries where kings\r\nor oligarchies rule, the government may be maintained, (however\r\nunjustly,) without educating the masses; but, in a republic, or popular\r\ngovernment, this is impossible; and the deluded masses of the South\r\nnever could have been driven into this rebellion, but for the ignorance\r\ninto which they had been plunged by slavery; nor is there any remedy for\r\nthe evil but emancipation. If, then, we would give stability and wisdom\r\nto the government, and perpetuity to the Union, we must abolish slavery,\r\nwhich withholds education and enlightenment from the masses of the\r\npeople, who, with us, control the policy of the nation.\r\n\r\nWith our only cause of ignorance and poverty among the people, and only\r\nelement of discord among the States, extirpated by the gradual removal\r\nof slavery and negroism, we would bound forward in a new and wonderful\r\ncareer of power and prosperity. Our noble vessel of state, the great\r\nRepublic, freighted with the hopes of humanity, and the liberties of our\r\ncountry and of mankind, still bearing aloft the flag of our mighty\r\nUnion, indissoluble by domestic traitors or conspiring oligarchs, will,\r\nunder Divine guidance, pass over the troubled waters, reassuring a\r\ndesponding world, as she glides into the blessed haven of safety and\r\nrepose. All the miracles of our past career would be eclipsed by the\r\nglories of the future. We might then laugh to scorn the impotent malice\r\nof foreign foes. Without force or fraud, without sceptre or bayonet, our\r\nmoral influence and example, for their own good, and by their own free\r\nchoice, would control the institutions and destiny of nations. The wise\r\nmen of the East may then journey westward again, to see the rising star\r\nof a regenerated humanity, the fall of thrones and dynasties, the\r\nlifting up of the downtrodden masses, and the political redemption of\r\nour race, not by a new dispensation, but by the fulfilment thus of the\r\nglorious prophecies and blessed promises of Holy Writ. And can we not\r\nlift ourselves into that serene atmosphere of love of country and of our\r\nrace, above all selfish schemes or mere party devices, and contemplate\r\nthe grandeur of these results, if now, _now_, NOW we will only do our\r\nduty? Now, indeed, is the 'accepted time,' now is the day of the\r\n'salvation' of our country. And now, as in former days of trouble, let\r\nus remember the mighty dead, as, when living, silencing the voice of\r\ntreason, and calming the tempest of revolution, he uttered those\r\nelectric words: 'UNION AND LIBERTY, NOW AND FOREVER, ONE AND\r\nINSEPARABLE!'\r\n\r\nIf we could rise to the height of prophetic vision, behold the\r\nprocession of coming events, and, unrolling the scroll of advancing\r\nyears and centuries, contemplate our Union securing by its example the\r\nrights and liberties of man, would we not welcome any sacrifice, even\r\ndeath itself, if we could thus aid in accomplishing results so god-like\r\nand sublime? But, whether in gloom or glory, chastened for national sins\r\nor rewarded for good deeds, let us realize the _great truth_, that the\r\nAlmighty directs nations as well as planets in their course, governs the\r\nmoral as well as the material world, never abdicating for a moment the\r\ncontrol of either; and that persevering opposition to his laws must\r\nmeet, in the end, retributive justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROMISE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   O watcher for the dawn of day,\r\n     As o'er the mountain peaks afar\r\n   Hangs in the twilight cold and gray,\r\n     Like a bright lamp, the morning star!\r\n   Though slow the daybeams creep along\r\n     The serried pines which top the hills,\r\n   And gloomy shadows brood among\r\n     The silent valleys, and the rills\r\n\r\n   Seem almost hushed--patience awhile!\r\n     Though slowly night to day gives birth,\r\n   Soon the young babe with radiant smile\r\n     Shall gladden all the waiting earth.\r\n   By fair gradation changes come,\r\n     No harsh transitions mar God's plan,\r\n   But slowly works from sun to sun\r\n     His perfect rule of love to man.\r\n\r\n   And patience, too, my countrymen,\r\n     In this our nation's fierce ordeal!\r\n   Bright burns the searching flame, and then,\r\n     The dross consumed, shall shine the real.\r\n   Wake, watcher! see the mountain peaks\r\n     Already catch a golden ray,\r\n   Light on the far horizon speaks\r\n     The dawning of a glorious day.\r\n\r\n   Murky the shadows still that cling\r\n     In the deep valleys, but the mist\r\n   Is soaring up on silver wing\r\n     To where the sun the clouds has kissed.\r\n   Hard-fought and long the strife may be,\r\n     The powers of wrong be slow to yield,\r\n   But Right shall gain the victory,\r\n     And Freedom hold the battle field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN DESTINY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would study the question of American Destiny in the light of common\r\nsense, of history, and of science.\r\n\r\nIt may be unusual to illustrate from science a principle which is to\r\nhave a political application; but we shall endeavor to do so, believing\r\nit to be unexceptionably legitimate. The different departments of\r\nscience, science and history, science and politics, have been,\r\nheretofore, kept quite distinct as to the provinces of inquiry to which\r\nit was presumed they severally belonged. Each has been cultivated as if\r\nit had no relation external to itself, and was not one of a family of\r\ncognate truths. This, however, is undergoing a gradual but certain\r\nchange, in which it is becoming constantly more manifest that between\r\nthe different departments of human inquiry there are mutual dependences\r\nand complicated interrelations, which enable us, by the truths of one\r\nscience, to thread the mazes of another.\r\n\r\nThere are certain general laws which pertain with equal validity to many\r\ndepartments of activity in the natural world; there are parallel lines\r\nof development as the result of the inherent correlation of forces.\r\nThus, if we have found a great general law in physiology, that same law\r\nmay apply with equal aptness to astronomy, geology, chemistry, and even\r\nto social and political evolution.\r\n\r\nOne of these general laws, and perhaps the most comprehensive in its\r\ncharacter and universal in its application of any yet known, we will\r\nannounce in the language of Guyot, the comparative geographer: 'We have\r\nrecognized in the life of all that develops itself, three successive\r\nstates, three grand phases, three evolutions, identically repeated in\r\nevery order of existence; a _chaos_, where all is confounded together; a\r\n_development_, where all is separating; a _unity_, where all is binding\r\nitself together and organizing. We have observed that here is the law of\r\n_phenomenal life_, the _formula_ of development, whether in inorganic\r\nnature or in organized nature.'\r\n\r\nThis answers for the department of physics and physiology. We will let\r\nGuizot, the historian, speak for the political and social realm: 'All\r\nthings, at their origin, are nearly confounded in one and the same\r\nphysiognomy; it is only in their aftergrowth that their variety shows\r\nitself. Then begins a new development which urges forward societies\r\ntoward that free and lofty unity, the glorious object of the efforts and\r\nwishes of mankind.'\r\n\r\nWe find an illustration of this law in the simplest of the sciences, if\r\nthe nebular hypothesis be true, as most astronomers believe. We have\r\nfirst the chaotic, nebulous matter, then the formation of worlds\r\ntherefrom, by a continuous process of unfolding. Each world is a unit\r\nwithin itself, but part of a still greater unit composed of a system of\r\nworlds revolving around the same sun; and this greater unit, part of one\r\nwhich is still greater--a star cluster, composed of many planetary\r\nsystems, and subject to the same great cosmical laws. If the theory be\r\ncorrect, we find, in this example, the heterogeneous derived from the\r\nsimple, and far more completely an organized unit, with all its\r\ncomplexity, than was the chaotic mass from which development originally\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\nWe find additional illustration in coming to our own world. Its primeval\r\ngeography was simple and uniform; there was little diversity of coast\r\nline, soil, or surface. But the cooling process of the earth went on,\r\nthe surface contracted and ridged up, the exposed rocks were\r\ndisintegrated by the action of the atmosphere and the waters; the\r\nsediment deposited in the bottom of the seas was thrown to the surface;\r\ncontinents were enlarged, higher mountain ranges upheaved, the coasts\r\nworn into greater irregularity of outline; and everywhere the soil\r\nbecame more composite, the surface more uneven, the landscape more\r\nvariegated.\r\n\r\nCorresponding changes have taken place in the climate. At first the\r\ntemperature of the earth was much warmer than now, and uniform in all\r\nparallels of latitude, as is shown by the fossil remains. Now we have a\r\ngreat diversity of climate, whether we contrast the polar with the\r\ntorrid regions, or the different seasons of the temperate zone with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe same law of increasing diversity obtains in the fauna and flora of\r\nthe various periods of geological history. The earliest fossil record of\r\nanimal life is witness to the simplicity of organic structure. Among\r\nvertebrated animals, fishes first appear, next reptiles, then birds;\r\nstill higher, the lower type of animals which suckle their young; and as\r\nthe strata become more recent, still higher forms of mammalia, till we\r\nreach the upper tertiary, in which geologists have discovered the\r\nremains of many animals of complex structure nearly allied to those\r\nwhich are now in existence. In the historic period appear many organic\r\nforms of still greater complexity, with man at the head of the\r\nzoological series.\r\n\r\nIn this glance of zoological progress, we discover increasing\r\ncomplication of two kinds; for while the individual structure has been\r\nconstantly becoming more complex, there are now in existence the\r\nanalogues of the lowest fossil types, which, with the highest, and with\r\nall the intermediate, present a maze and vastness of complication,\r\nwhich, in comparison with the homogeneity of the aggregate of early\r\nstructure, is sufficiently obvious and impressive.\r\n\r\nThere is in this view, still another outline of increasing complexity.\r\nAt first the same types prevailed all over the earth's surface; but as\r\nthe soil, atmosphere, and climate changed, and the animal structure\r\nbecame more complex and varied, the limits of particular species became\r\nmore and more localized, till the earth's surface presented zoological\r\ndistricts, with the fauna of each peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nBut, what of unitization? Here, there appears to be divergence only, and\r\nthat continually increasing.\r\n\r\nGuyot says that 'the unity reappears with the creation of man, who\r\ncombines in his physical nature all the perfections of the animal, and\r\nwho is the end of all this long progression of organized beings.'\r\nAgassiz recognizes man alone as cosmopolite; and Comte regards him as\r\nthe supreme head of the economy of nature, and representative of the\r\nfundamental unity of the anatomical scale.\r\n\r\nBut another and more obvious example of unitization in complexity, is\r\nderivable from the consideration of the animal organism, and will soon\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\nWe will merely mention in passing, that the most complex animals, in the\r\nvarious stages of fetal development through which they pass, correspond\r\nto the types of structure which are permanent in the lower forms of\r\nanimal life. Thus, in the zoological chain, there are beings of all\r\ngrades, from the most simple in structure to the most complex; and the\r\nmost complex animal, in its development from the ovum or egg, passes\r\nthrough all these grades of structure, ending in that which is above\r\nall, and distinctively its own. 'Without going into tedious details, man\r\npresents, as regards the most important of his constituent structures,\r\nhis nervous system, the successive characteristics of an avertebrated\r\nanimal, a fish, a turtle, a bird, a quadruped, a quadrumanous animal,\r\nbefore he assumes the special human characteristics.' (Draper.)\r\n\r\nOur purpose being to show that while complexity of structure is\r\nconstantly increasing, unitization, or the organized dependence of one\r\npart on another, is, at the same time, becoming more complete, we shall\r\nrefer briefly to the comparative anatomy and physiology of animals.\r\nThere is in this connection such wealth of material--a long chain of\r\nanimal beings with all grades of structure from very simple to very\r\ncomplex; each complex animal, in its development from the ovum, passing\r\nthrough all the lower types of structure in succession; so many new\r\norgans and functions arising in the course of this development; each\r\norgan so arising, becoming, in its turn, more complex in structure, more\r\nspecialized in function, and more dependent on the office of other\r\norgans;--in the midst, I say, of all this wealth of material, indicated\r\nhere in a great general and imperfect manner, the difficulty, in so\r\nbrief an exposition as this, is to know what facts to seize upon as\r\ncalculated to illustrate most aptly the principle under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe development of the senses, with reference to their organs, nerves,\r\nand functions, presents a striking illustration of increasing\r\ncomplexity.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest forms of animal life, we find general sensibility only,\r\nand it is claimed that this exists in the lowest forms, without even the\r\npresence of nerves. But as we rise higher in the scale, the special\r\norgans of sense gradually become developed--one new sense after another\r\nappears; but this is not the only line of increasing complexity. When an\r\norgan of sense first appears, its function is of the simplest character;\r\nand it is only when we reach the highest types of animal life that it\r\nperforms the greatest variety of offices peculiar thereto. That of touch\r\nis, at first, but crude and simple, becoming delicate and complicated\r\nonly in the highest types. The sense of pain is a differentiated\r\nfunction, possessed only in a slight degree by reptiles and fishes, and\r\nprobably not at all by animals still lower in the scale.\r\n\r\nThe eye-spots of star fishes and jelly fishes simply distinguish light\r\nfrom darkness, much as we do with our eyes closed. There are many\r\ndegrees of development from this condition of the inferior organism to\r\nthat of the human eye, which distinguishes the nicest shades of color,\r\ndistance, form, and size of objects, and the play of passion on the\r\nhuman countenance.\r\n\r\nThe same variety of function is acquired by the ear in its development\r\nfrom its simplest to its most complex form. In the higher animals, the\r\norgan of hearing is formed of three parts, an external, middle, and\r\ninternal portion; but in birds the external ear is wanting; in fishes\r\nboth the external and middle parts are wanting; in mollusks it is\r\nreduced to a simple sack of microscopic dimensions, filled with a liquid\r\nin which there are otolithes, or pebbly substances. Such an organ can\r\ndistinguish noises only; it can recognize nothing of the infinite\r\nvariety of articulations, notes, tones, melodies, harmonies of the human\r\nvoice and of musical instruments. There is even a great difference\r\nbetween the disciplined, and therefore differentiated ear of a cultured\r\nperson, and the undisciplined, and therefore less differentiated ear of\r\na boor. Similar specializations of structure and function pertain to the\r\nother senses; but we may pass them.\r\n\r\nThe digestive, circulatory, and respiratory systems, and all the other\r\nsystems of the animal structure, evince the same law.\r\n\r\nThe lowest form of the circulating fluid, as in sponges, is simply water\r\ncontaining gases and organic particles; and this can scarcely be spoken\r\nof as circulating, for it is merely drawn in and then expelled. A little\r\nhigher in the scale naturalists find a 'chylaqueous fluid,' which\r\noscillates in the general cavity of the sack-like animal. The true blood\r\nis another step in development; and even this organized fluid changes\r\nits character as the scale advances. Most animals have no heart; and\r\nwhen the organ does first appear, it is but a simple, rudimentary\r\nstructure, very unlike the complex machine which plays at the centre of\r\ncirculation in the higher types.\r\n\r\nThough fishes breathe through their gills, receiving all the oxygen they\r\nrequire from the small amount of air in the water, the swimming bladder\r\nis in them the rudimentary lung--a very simple structure, indeed, when\r\ncompared with the more complex arrangement for respiration in the higher\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nSome animals of gelatinous, and therefore flexible structure, perform\r\ndigestion by folding their bodies over the food, and pressing the\r\nnutritious matter out of it: they extemporize a stomach for the\r\noccasion. And even in some of their higher types, in such as have a\r\npermanent mouth and stomach, the digestive process is simply a squeezing\r\nout of the elements of nutrition. The digestive apparatus, from being a\r\nsimple sack in the polype and similar organisms, becomes, by a\r\ncontinuous unfolding, the complicated structure which we find in the\r\nhigher animals, with various organs effecting various parts of the\r\ndigestive change, and even different parts of the same organ having\r\nspecialized functions to perform.\r\n\r\nThe most complex animal proceeds originally from a simple cell; and 'at\r\nthe two extremes we may contemplate the single germinal membrane of the\r\novum, which is discharging contemporaneously every function--digesting,\r\nabsorbing, respiring, etc.; and the complete organic apparatus of man,\r\nthe stomach, the lungs, the skin, the kidneys, and the liver--mechanisms\r\nset apart each for the discharge of a special duty, yet each having\r\narisen, as we know positively from watching the order of their\r\ndevelopment, from that simple germinal membrane.' (Draper.) This is what\r\none physiologist says of the ovum which is being developed into a\r\ncomplex being. Here is what another says of animals at the lower end of\r\nthe zoological scale: 'The simplest organisms breathe, exhale, secrete,\r\nabsorb, and reproduce, by their envelopes alone.' (Lewes.) Here we\r\nperceive the resemblance between the ovum of the higher animals and the\r\npermanent structure of the lower animals. Indeed, some of the lower\r\nforms of animal life are simply cells. How vast the difference between\r\nthe organism of man, with all its complexity of structure, and that of\r\nthe Ameba or Actinophrys, which, being merely a homogeneous mass of\r\norganic matter, performs all the functions of its simple life without\r\nany special organ whatever! Yet, is man any less a unit than the Ameba,\r\nor any other simple organism? Does his multiplicity of organs impair the\r\nintegrity of his anatomical and physiological oneness? Is the\r\ncirculation independent of respiration? Is digestion independent of the\r\ncirculation? Can any one organ act independently of the others? Is not\r\nthe entire series of parts, organs, and functions bound up in complete\r\nand inseparable unity? The vicarious action of one organ for another has\r\nbeen a question among physiologists; and if admitted, as in the case of\r\nthe salivary glands acting for the kidneys in profuse spitting, and the\r\nskin for the liver, the vicarious function can only obtain to a slight\r\ndegree and in a temporary manner. The destruction of any considerable\r\norgan involves the destruction of all the rest. I repeat that the\r\nintegrity of the physiological unity at the top of the scale, is far\r\nmore complete, with all its complexity, than is the integrity of the\r\nphysiological unity at the bottom of the scale, with its marked\r\nsimplicity of structure. By no sort of legerdemain or surgical skill can\r\nwe make an individual mammal become two. If we divide it, the whole\r\ndies. Not so, however, with some of the lower grades of animal\r\nexistence. Cut a hydra into thirty or forty pieces, and each piece will\r\nbecome a distinct animal--a facsimile of the original one. In quite an\r\nanalogous way do a large number of animals at the lower end of the scale\r\npropagate, by segmentation and division; one individual becoming two,\r\ntwo four, and so on.\r\n\r\nMany examples might be adduced to show the absence of organized unity in\r\nthe lower orders of the animal creation. Thus, in the annelid, which is\r\ncomposed of a great many similar rings, and is regarded as quite a\r\ncomplex creature, there is so little dependence of one part on another,\r\nthat a number of the rings may be destroyed without any injury to the\r\nrest. The Synapta, when in want of food, will amputate its own body to\r\nprocure the necessary supply; and it has been observed to repeat the\r\noperation, until it 'had by degrees eaten away the whole of its body to\r\nkeep life in the head.' (Quatrefages.) Such a phenomenon as this is very\r\nunlike that presented by the higher animals, which, together with their\r\nmultiplied individuality of part and function, and their infinite\r\nvariety of physiognomic expression, present, at the same time, a unity\r\nof organization so complete, that an injury to one part is\r\ninstantaneously telegraphed to all parts of the system, and sympathized\r\nin by all to a greater or less extent.\r\n\r\nAs in physiology, the development of the individual corresponds to the\r\ndevelopment of the entire zoological series; so, when we rise into the\r\npsychological realm, do we ascertain that the development of the\r\nindividual mind corresponds to the development of the mental series from\r\nthe savage to the civilized. In the physiognomy of the savage there is\r\nlittle variety of expression; he has not differentiated that\r\nmultiplicity of thought and feeling which moulds the face and plays upon\r\nits lineaments in the cultivated Teuton. The same is true of the latter\r\nwhile an infant. But who will say that the cultured man of this age is\r\nless a balanced, unitized creature than the child of the cradle, or of\r\nthe forest? The latter is but a creature of impulse, moved by every\r\nappetite, and swayed by every gust of passion. He has no fixed\r\nprinciples for the regulation of his life. There is no presiding power\r\nto rule and subordinate the tumultuous and refractory elements of his\r\ncharacter, and thus unitize the mental organism and its manifestations.\r\nThis is what culture gives. Here then we also perceive that with the\r\ndevelopment of variety and complexity, the element of unity becomes more\r\nactive and manifest. This view of the progressive unitization of the\r\nindividual man in a psychological aspect, is very suggestive when taken\r\nin connection with the wane of despotism and the growth of liberty, as\r\nsociety and government advance, and it becomes ever less the province of\r\nlaw to govern, and also to regulate.\r\n\r\nWe have adduced some of the illustrations which physical and\r\nphysiological science affords of the Law of Universal Development: let\r\nus close this part of our subject with the illustrations afforded by the\r\nrise and progress of Science as a whole. The first germs of science were\r\nvery simple, existing in connection with Art, and subserving the\r\npurposes of priestcraft. For a long time the range of scientific inquiry\r\nwas so limited that the same individual was able to grasp it entire. But\r\none branch after another has sprung up, diverging more and more into the\r\nrealms of the unknown, until no one mind can hope to obtain even a\r\ngeneral knowledge of them all.\r\n\r\nBut this has not been the only tendency of scientific growth. Divergence\r\nand differentiation had not proceeded far till the combining and\r\norganizing movement began. The more individuality and complexity have\r\nthreatened to outreach the mental powers and become unmanageable, the\r\nmore have order and organization shown their ability to subordinate and\r\nunitize the seeming diversity of elements. While the sciences continued\r\nto increase in number and complexity, they began to overlap and\r\ninterlace, the principles of one running into the domain of another,\r\nand even cooerdinating and binding together its seemingly incongruous\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nA simple scientific generalization is based on certain facts which,\r\ntaken in their collective capacity, mean the truth which is expressed in\r\nthe formula. A higher generalization embraces those which are simpler,\r\nand unites by its expression the truths which they contain into the\r\nformula of one great truth. This process goes on, rising constantly\r\nhigher and higher, the generalizations of the ascending series becoming\r\nmore comprehensive, and the convergence of all the diversified elements\r\ninto great general laws more striking and complete. Thus advances the\r\nunitizing movement of science; and it is now progressing with a\r\nsteadiness and certainty unknown in former periods of research. Great\r\nminds are at this moment occupied in the discovery and verification of\r\nthese great unitizing laws. Thus we perceive, that while science has\r\ndeveloped a bewildering mass of individual facts and minor principles,\r\nit has also developed the germs of a unity which is destined to unfold\r\nwith a richness and magnificence of result heretofore unknown in the\r\nannals of human inquiry.\r\n\r\nAs the special departments of science have testified, so also does the\r\ngeneral view of all science testify to this Law of Universal\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\nBut, what has all this to do with American Destiny? Very much, as may\r\nyet appear. It is by the Past only that we can read the Future; and if\r\nin history and in all development, there is revealed by the inductive\r\nprocess a great general law, that law becomes the Oracle of Destiny.\r\n\r\nA fitting transition from science to history would be ethnology, the\r\nscience of races, connected as it is with physics, chemistry, and\r\nphysiology, on the one hand, and with history on the other.\r\n\r\nThere are different theories in vogue to account for the diversity of\r\nhuman races now in existence. Some refer human origin to an original\r\npair, whose descendants have changed through the action of physical\r\ncauses, as food, soil, climate, and scenery, and also through the\r\noperation of moral ones as dependent on the physical, and therefore\r\nsecondary thereto, such as manners, customs, and government. Others\r\ndeduce it from different lines of development, coming up through the\r\nzoological scale, and thence passing from the lower to the higher races\r\nof men. Others still speak of mankind as originating 'in nations,' each\r\nrace being fixed in its physical and mental characteristics, and having\r\nan origin independent and distinct from all others.\r\n\r\nIt matters little to our purpose which of these theories may be true,\r\nthe difference as to aptness of illustration being only one of degree.\r\nWe prefer, however, to deal with facts in regard to which there is\r\nlittle or no difference of opinion among the theorists themselves.\r\n\r\nThere are simple and complex peoples or races, as there are simple and\r\ncomplex organisms. Take any primitive race, whether described in history\r\nor by some contemporaneous traveller: in a physical point of view, the\r\nmen are all very nearly alike, and the women likewise. Describe one\r\nindividual, and you have the description for all other individuals of\r\nthe same sex belonging to the race. And there is not usually as much\r\ndifference in the physical appearance of the sexes in primitive races as\r\namong those who stand higher in the scale. What is true of their\r\nphysique, is also true of their minds. As one thinks and feels, so all\r\nthink and feel--and that, too, without concert; it is the simple\r\nexpression of an undiversified mental organism. Their faculties are rude\r\nand uncultivated; they act chiefly on the perceptive plane, reflecting\r\nbut little. They are predominantly sensual, not having developed the\r\nhigher mental activities which pertain to an advanced state of society\r\nand result in those great diversities of attainment and expression among\r\nindividuals of the same people. There are reasons for believing that\r\nthere was a time when this planet had no human inhabitants but races of\r\nthis simple type. Great changes have taken place since that day; changes\r\nwhich, by the law of their accomplishment, correspond precisely with the\r\nchanges which have taken place in the zoological scale. Owing to causes\r\nwhich we may not fully understand, races have been developed which\r\npresent, each within its own limits, great contrarieties of physical\r\nappearance and mental characteristics. Among 'Anglo-Saxons' there is\r\noften greater diversity in members of the same family, than you would\r\nfind in a million individuals of a primitive race. The complex appears,\r\nsomehow or other, to have been developed from the simple.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact of a population becoming more numerous, necessitates\r\ncertain changes--from hunting to pasturage, for example, from pastoral\r\nlife to agricultural and fixed habitation--and these would affect the\r\nhabits, modes of thought, and, to some extent, personal appearance. The\r\nmodification of climate by clearing, draining, and cultivation, and the\r\nremoval of a people from one climate to another, would effect still\r\nother changes. But the intermixture of races by war and immigration has,\r\nperhaps, done more than any other cause to produce the great physical\r\ndiversities which we now find in the higher races. Having traced the\r\nstream of warlike immigration from Eastern Asia westward, and thence to\r\nCentral Europe, and still westward and southward to the shores of the\r\nAtlantic, and even across the Mediterranean into Africa, overwhelming\r\nthe Roman Empire of the West in its course,--observe this tide of human\r\nmovement, as wave followed wave for centuries, rolling peoples against\r\nand over one another, confounding them together, and leaving them upon\r\nthe same soil, or in close proximity to each other; and, even admitting\r\nthat they were simple and primitive to begin with, we shall not wonder\r\nat the diversified aspect of the people of Europe and their descendants\r\nin America. But this is only one series of movements from which has\r\nresulted the intermixture of races; there are others, and some, no\r\ndoubt, beyond the farthest reach of history. The process of intermixture\r\nis still going on, especially in the Western World, though by methods\r\nusually more peaceful than formerly. The result multiplies itself, and\r\nthe leading races of mankind are becoming constantly more composite.\r\n\r\nThe contact and intermixture of races have had a moral result, which, in\r\nits turn, acts upon the physical. Mental development has been one of the\r\nresults of war and immigration; one people learning from another, and\r\nstriking out new modes of thought from the sheer necessity of new\r\ncircumstances; and this mental development changing the physiognomic\r\nexpression and general bearing of the man. This result has been\r\nincreasing in geometrical progression since history, printing, and the\r\nfacilities of intercommunication have made the culture of one people\r\ncontagious to other peoples, and the attainments of one generation\r\navailable to all the generations that follow. Thus does every movement\r\namong the nations conspire to change the simple types into those which\r\nare more complex.\r\n\r\nThe ethnological unity may be less apparent; and before we clearly\r\nperceive it, we may have to rise into the consideration of social and\r\npolitical relations, not divorcing these from physiology, without which\r\nno question relative to man can be rightly judged. And it may be that\r\nafter greater development in this direction, the unity of races may\r\nbecome more distinctly pronounced and more readily recognized.\r\n\r\nWe may observe, in passing, that the same causes which have contributed\r\nto this ethnological complexity, have, at the same time, aided in the\r\ndevelopment of the cosmical idea--the idea of the unity of the universe.\r\nAt first, tribes had little communication with each other, and knew\r\nnothing of geography beyond the limits of their own hunting grounds.\r\nThey knew as little of the vastness of the earth outside of their domain\r\nas of that of the universe. This could only be conjectured from the\r\nvantage ground of some degree of intellectual culture, and the idea must\r\nremain vague and indefinite till after long ages of real experience and\r\nintellectual unfolding. It was not till after Alexander's conquests in\r\nthe East, the extension of the Roman Empire, the invention of the\r\nmariner's compass, the discovery of America, and the circumnavigation of\r\nthe globe, together with the perfection of optical instruments by the\r\nuse of which the true character of the celestial bodies was\r\ndemonstrated, that the cosmical idea became truly a scientific one.\r\n(Humboldt.) Thus were the partial and fragmentary notions of early\r\npeoples at length corrected, enlarged, unitized.\r\n\r\nClosely akin to this is the development of the god-idea. Fetich-worship\r\nis that of the rudest people. They see a god in every individual object,\r\nin every stream, in every tree, in every stone. All they see is,\r\nhowever, shrouded in mystery, and they have a blind veneration for every\r\nobject. A step farther, and the developing mind generalizes these\r\nobjects. The individual trees, for example, are taken collectively, and\r\ntheir divine representative worshipped as the god of the groves. There\r\nare, at the same time, other unitizing conceptions of the god-idea.\r\nThere is a god of the hills, a god of the streams, of the seas, and so\r\non. New classes of divinities may be evolved in the mythological system;\r\nthe strong and salient passions of our nature may come to have their\r\ndeities--to be unitized, at length, with all other gods. Meantime,\r\nmankind are forming into states, with some degree of regular government;\r\nand apparently in accordance with this fact, the gods are subjected to\r\nthe partial control of one who is greater than all the rest, and who is\r\ntheir father and king, but himself subject to the decrees of Fate.\r\nAnother grand step, and seemingly in correspondence with the more\r\ncentralized government of a vast and powerful empire, we hear of one God\r\nonly, who is all-powerful, and master of Fate itself, with a hierarchy\r\nof angels, powers, and principalities, reaching from God to man, and\r\nsubordinate to the Central Will, which rules all things, whether 'in the\r\narmies of heaven or among the inhabitants of the earth.' Thus did the\r\nidea of one God eventually swallow up all the others; and the god-idea\r\nwas completely unitized.\r\n\r\nWe now come to consider the political and social evolution of mankind,\r\nas it appears to be revealed by the comparison of various stages of\r\nnational growth.\r\n\r\nThe primitive condition of all races, so far as history and travel\r\nreveal it, correspond with what is characterized as homogeneous or\r\nunorganized. Socially and politically, individuals of the same sex are\r\nall alike. There are no classes in society, no rulers, no\r\naristocrats--no society even--nothing but individuals; and it is here\r\nthat we find individuality in its purest form. There is no law\r\noriginating with a sovereign, or with the people, for the adjustment of\r\ndifficulties; every individual avenges his own wrongs in his own way.\r\nCooeperation is scarcely known; there is nothing in their habits, nothing\r\nin their social and political relations to bind society together; there\r\nare no specialized parts or functions--no dependence of one part on\r\nanother; it is marked by a homogeneity of structure, if structure it can\r\nbe called, which is unimpeachable. The only cooeperation which obtains\r\nbeyond the limits of the family, is that of hunting and war; and these\r\nexercises develop the need of a chief or leader. The strongest and most\r\ndaring are self-elected by virtue of individual prowess. But still the\r\nchief is very like all the rest of the tribe, lives in the same style,\r\nprovides for his own wants in the same way, has no special\r\nprivileges--is merely a chief or leader, and nothing more. And\r\nafterward, when he may have acquired some degree of authority, that\r\nauthority is purely of a military character--civil government is not yet\r\nborn. Usage comes at length to confirm the chief's right, and human\r\nselfishness works out its legitimate results: smaller men are dwarfed,\r\nas occasion permits, in order that the one who is greatest may be\r\nmagnified. His office becomes hereditary, and his family is, at length,\r\nfabled to have descended from the gods. This is the tendency of\r\nprimitive ignorance and superstition: there must be a sensual object for\r\nthe blind veneration of sensual minds; and the imagination readily\r\nprovides this, by attributing to the progenitors of their chiefs vast\r\ncorporeal forms, great strength and skill, undaunted courage, and\r\nsuccess in amorous intrigue--the perfection of those qualities which\r\nthey themselves most covet. Their chiefs or petty kings are now such by\r\ndivine origin; and when civil relations become developed, one man\r\ncombines within himself all the prerogatives of civil, military, and\r\nreligious government.\r\n\r\nThe ambition and turbulence of the chief or petty king and of his people\r\nbring them into hostile conflict with other tribes or petty states; and\r\nwhen victorious, they appropriate the conquered territory, and\r\nannihilate, enslave, or extend their rule over the vanquished people.\r\nThis warlike encroachment and increase of power alarm other states, and\r\nthey form confederacies or leagues more or less intimate and permanent\r\nfor resistance and mutual protection. Thus does the unitizing element of\r\ngovernment gather strength with the progress of political movement.\r\n\r\nThe ambitious chieftain, having acquired greater power than his\r\nneighbors, conceives of further aggrandizement, undertakes new\r\nconquests, attacks the weak, and adds other states to his own, till in\r\ntime he may have made himself a great sovereign and won a great kingdom.\r\nThese new conquests impose additional cares on the ruler; but he uses\r\nthe tools of his power to execute his will; he governs his kingdoms with\r\nabsolute sway, as a general governs his army; it is a military despotism\r\nof the simplest structure, and all prerogatives and interests are merged\r\nin and subservient to this one. The civil function is not yet developed\r\nas distinct from the military. Only one idea pervades the government,\r\nand that is the idea of absolute rule by brute force. Society has as yet\r\ndeveloped few elements, has but few interests and little functional\r\ndiversity; there are only two classes, the ruler and the ruled, the\r\nmasters and the slaves. There being but few political and social\r\ninterests to play among each other, there cannot be development for want\r\nof activity; there can be little progress of any kind. Such are the\r\nsimple, unprogressive, one-idea governments which prevailed in the\r\nearliest times of which we have any tolerably authentic record, and\r\nwhich still prevail among half-civilized peoples.\r\n\r\nGovernment is simply a growth, a development, and it must correspond to\r\nthe character of the people out of whose mental status it has sprung. If\r\nthe people are homogeneous in their mental structure, their social and\r\npolitical interests must be correspondingly homogeneous and simple. The\r\nmore rude and primitive the minds of any people, the fewer are the\r\nrelations external to the individual which obtain among them. But when a\r\npeople, or a mixture of peoples, have developed great versatility of\r\nmind, a great variety of tastes, propensities, aspirations, and\r\ninterests, their social and political institutions become\r\ncorrespondingly heterogeneous and complex. Such are the social and\r\npolitical systems of Middle and Western Europe. There was nothing of the\r\nkind in the ancient world. Then the people were more simple and less\r\nversatile in their mental habitudes; and a simple, though despotic\r\ngovernment was the inevitable outgrowth. Rome was but a military\r\ndespotism, and it conquered and ruled with military stringency. It was\r\nnot till the reign of Diocletian that the civil functions were divorced\r\nfrom the military, and then only to a partial extent. It remained for\r\nConstantine to carry out more fully what Diocletian had begun, and to\r\ndivide, or, if you please, to differentiate the governmental functions\r\nto an extent which had been altogether unknown before.\r\n\r\nThe people of the provinces subject to Roman dominion had no recognized\r\nrights, no voice in their own government, but were dominated by the\r\ncentral power at Rome. The right of representation, so sacred in modern\r\ntimes as an element of confederate policy, they did not desire nor\r\nappreciate; for, when seven provinces of the south of Gaul were\r\ncommanded by the emperor Honorius to send a representation of their\r\nchief men to the city of Arles for the supervision of interests which\r\nconcerned themselves, they disregarded the mandate. A central despotism\r\nmaintained Roman unity; and, whenever its iron arm should by any means\r\nbecome weakened, the empire must fall into fragments.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of the Roman Empire in the West was the end of one\r\ncycle; thence began another--that in which we now are, and which should\r\nbe of absorbing interest to us. A state of affairs quite unlike anything\r\nknown before was then inaugurated. Hundreds of years have been required\r\nto develop results so as to enable the human mind to divine at all\r\ndefinitely the law of its movement; and hundreds more may be required to\r\ndevelop the full fruition of what was then so inauspiciously begun.\r\n\r\nAs we are all aware, the Roman Empire of the West was overrun by hordes\r\nof barbarians from the North, who annihilated a great portion of the old\r\npopulation, and changed the character of society. But Rome did not die\r\nwithout bequeathing a legacy to be enjoyed by the descendants at least\r\nof those by whose hands she had fallen. There was still some remembrance\r\nof what Rome was. Guizot says that 'the two elements which passed from\r\nthe Roman civilization into ours were, first, the system of municipal\r\ncorporations--its habits, its regulations, its principle of liberty, a\r\ngeneral civil legislation common to all; secondly, the idea of absolute\r\npower--the principle of order and the principle of servitude.' These\r\nelements, though almost latent for a time, were destined to make up and\r\nplay a conspicuous part in the war of diversified interests and the\r\nadjustment of political relations, hundreds of years afterward.\r\n\r\nAnother element of society at the time of the Fall, was the Church. The\r\nbarbarians conquered the empire, but the Church conquered them; without\r\ngaining much, however, to show for her victory; for, while the\r\nbarbarians embraced Christianity, they reduced it to barbarism, and were\r\nmuch the same rude, cruel people, after their conversion, that they were\r\nbefore. The Church, however, in its origin and growth, illustrates the\r\nlaw under consideration, in the gradual development of the distinct\r\nspecialities of organization; and we are now regarding it at a time when\r\nit was one element among others, and destined with them, by the\r\ninteraction of their various forces, to evolve a still higher unity.\r\n\r\nAnother element in society, at this time, was that which was brought by\r\nthe conquerors from their native wilds in the free North. They were a\r\nrude, and even savage people, with no fixed ideas of property, but\r\nliving by hunting and pasturage, and driving their herds from one region\r\nto another as necessity required. The most marked and distinctive\r\nfeature in their character, and that which played the most conspicuous\r\npart in the social and political drama of the following centuries of\r\ndevelopment, was their personal independence--their almost absolute\r\nindividuality, as the result, we believe, of their superior native\r\nphysical constitution.\r\n\r\nThey had little or no cooeperation in their own country; no combination\r\nof civil interests; no settled government. They were apt for adventure,\r\nand readily formed into bands of roving warriors; and when pressed\r\nforward by the tide of warlike immigration from the East, they conquered\r\nthe Roman Empire, and divided the lands among themselves. German\r\nmagnates courted followers in their own country by hospitality, by\r\npresents of horses and arms; but in the conquered countries, by grants\r\nof land for military service. These grants were at first made during\r\npleasure, then for life, and at length they became hereditary.\r\n(Robertson.) In this manner it appears that the feudal system\r\noriginated--a system which grew into such magnificent proportions in\r\nMiddle and Western Europe. It was, however, a growth which was five\r\ncenturies in maturing. (Hallam.)\r\n\r\nA curious circumstance, connected with its development, deserves to be\r\nnoticed, as showing that certain rights, however desirable, and even\r\nsacred they may seem to be, must succumb to the prevailing order,\r\nhowever undesirable that system or order might, under other\r\ncircumstances, appear to be. Allodial lands, or those held in the right\r\nof the individual, and for which there was no obligation of service,\r\nexcept in the general defence, were at length swallowed up by the feudal\r\nsystem. In those days of universal anarchy, rapine, and oppression, the\r\nrule of might and unrestrained selfishness prevailed to such an extent,\r\nthat small proprietors, having no means of defence against the strong,\r\nwere compelled to surrender their allodial title for a feudal one, and\r\ndo homage to the neighboring lord for the sake of protection. And to\r\nsuch an extent did the abasement of allodial privileges prevail, that it\r\ncame at length to be recognized as a principle that the feudal\r\narrangement was the only legitimate one; whereupon allodial lands were\r\nseized with impunity, and appropriated by the feudal barons. Even the\r\nChurch was subordinated by the prevailing system. Bishops became feudal\r\nlords. The incomes of religious service were, in some cases, seized upon\r\nby the irresponsible barons, and disposed of according to the feudal\r\npolicy. This, however, is but one example of the struggle of a system or\r\nmovement to subordinate what stands in its way, and become universal; it\r\nis a law of history.\r\n\r\nThe feudal system was a very complete embodiment of despotism. It grew\r\nout of the political circumstances and mental status of the times, and\r\ncould only exist by the warrant of these conditions. It had its\r\nredeeming qualities, however, and, no doubt, promoted the conditions and\r\nthe spirit which prepared the way for its own overthrow and the\r\ninauguration of a better system. The isolated and pent-up condition of\r\nall classes, together with such culture as was afforded by their mode of\r\nlife to the inmates of the baronial castle, made the occasion for that\r\ngeneral restlessness in society from which proceeded such ready response\r\nto the fanatical appeals of Peter the Hermit. The Crusades lasted two\r\nhundred years, and contributed to the overthrow of feudalism by the\r\nincrease of general intelligence and the diminution of the baronial\r\nestates.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the empire, the cities began to decline, and their\r\ngovernment fell, in a great measure, into the hands of the clergy; and\r\nthence supervened a kind of ecclesiastical municipal system. Commerce,\r\nwhich some centuries later began to develop, gave renewed importance to\r\nthe cities; and the activities developed within them were antagonistic\r\nto the feudal spirit, and destined to contribute their part, and an\r\nimportant one, to the process of ultimate organization and its\r\naccompanying phenomena. The cities at length became free, not without a\r\nstruggle; for it is not to be supposed that the great barons would\r\npassively allow the enfranchisement of a rival power within their own\r\ndomains. In those rude times, the cities had little intercourse with\r\neach other; yet they became independent nearly at the same time, showing\r\nthat this political phenomenon was also a growth arising out of the\r\ncondition of the times--the result of political and social causes acting\r\nin concert over more than half a continent.\r\n\r\nThe cities accomplished their political mission by doing something\r\ntoward establishing law and order, and fostering the germs of freedom.\r\nTheir example could not but tell upon their immediate neighbors. In some\r\ncases they even attacked the nearest feudal lords, and afterward those\r\nmore remote, compelling them to become citizens. Thus was feudalism\r\noverthrown in Italy in the thirteenth century. Elsewhere, commerce had\r\nas yet done less for the cities, and their progress was less rapid. But,\r\nwhenever they appeared, they had the great barons to contend with. The\r\nfree cities or communities gradually extended intercourse with each\r\nother; and for objects of commerce and mutual defence against their\r\nenemies, they formed into leagues. Coalitions of the feudal barons also\r\nsprung up, and wars between the two systems were frequent and bloody.\r\nFeudal France made war on municipal France. The Hanseatic league,\r\nembracing at one time eighty-five German cities, maintained successful\r\nwars against the monarchs themselves. There was a confederacy of cities\r\nin Italy of great power and influence. These movements show that the\r\nformer isolated condition of European society was no longer compatible\r\nwith the change which was being gradually brought about in the social\r\nelements. We perceive a manifest tendency toward more extensive union;\r\nlarger combinations were becoming a demand of the times.\r\n\r\nBut, along with the progress of this tendency to unity, we perceive that\r\nsociety was constantly becoming more diversified in character, and its\r\nelements more distinctly defined. The institution of chivalry, the\r\ntroubadours, and minnesingers had played their part. Besides those great\r\npolitical and social powers, the Church, the barons, the kings, and the\r\nfree cities, new classes were rising in society, giving it greater\r\ncomplexity, and, by their diversified activities and needs, urging it\r\nforward to a more comprehensive and centralized organization. At first,\r\nin the twelfth century, the inhabitants of the cities or free\r\ncommunities were composed only of 'small traders and small landed or\r\nhouse proprietors.' 'Three centuries afterward there were added to\r\nthese, lawyers, physicians, men of letters, and local magistrates.'\r\n(Guizot.)\r\n\r\nIn the rude and chaotic society which succeeded the fall of the empire,\r\nthere was no occupation honorable but that of arms; but in the course of\r\ntime, the meed of honor assumed new branches, and fell upon various\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the Pandects of Justinian in the twelfth century, gave\r\nthe study of the law a new impulse, and, together with accompanying\r\ndevelopments, complicated the administration of justice. Rude and\r\nignorant warriors were no longer adequate to this function; civil\r\nprocesses required a distinct organ; the profession of law arose, and\r\ncommanded its share of public attention and respect. With the rise of\r\ncommerce, there was developed a commercial class, which acquired wealth,\r\npower, distinction, and a demand for rights. With the revival of\r\nlearning and philosophy, however unpromising at first, there arose a\r\nliterary class, which attracted notice and acquired influence.\r\n\r\nIn the view given of the earlier stages of modern civilization, we\r\nperceive, first, a social chaos which obtained for some time after the\r\nfall of the empire in the West; secondly, the development out of this\r\nchaos, in the course of centuries, of various political and social\r\npowers, classes, and interests, which were differentiated from the\r\nunorganized mass; thirdly, all these diversified elements, classes, and\r\ninterests, gradually tending to the formation of more comprehensive\r\nrelations with each other. There was no general organization of these\r\nseveral elements, in the early periods of the modern cycle. There were\r\nwhat were called kings and kingdoms, but it was not till a comparatively\r\nrecent period that the government became an integer, a complete\r\norganism, with a sensorium and will-power, and a mutual interrelation\r\nand dependence of parts and functions. During the prevalence of the\r\nfeudal system and the rise of the independent communities, European\r\nsociety was composed of innumerable fragments, isolated from each other,\r\nand each caring for itself only, looking to no centre as the source of\r\npolitical order and vitality, without organization or head. The king did\r\nnot rule the barons any more than the barons ruled the king--they were\r\nrival powers; the barons and the cities were rival powers; the kings and\r\nbarons played off the cities against each other. The Church, by the\r\npeculiarity of its constitution and character, was related to them all.\r\nThe clergy were the subjects of the king, the vassals of the baron, and\r\nyet the spiritual lords of both, as well as of their feudal peers. And\r\nwhen the Church effected the separation of her own from the political\r\npower, she sought, in turn, to subordinate the latter; and secular\r\nrulers were obliged to resist her encroachments to save themselves. The\r\nkings had no fixed revenue adequate to government, and were the sport of\r\nthe capricious elements within their own realms. But the Crusades\r\nbrought all these fragments into closer relations, and broke the power\r\nof the feudal lords. The king gained what the barons lost; and with\r\nthese powerful, turbulent, and refractory subjects out of the way, the\r\ncities were easily subordinated. The sovereign acquired at length an\r\nadequate revenue and a standing army; he was now enabled to command the\r\nresources of his kingdom, and play a king's part in the drama of\r\nnations. Thus was consummated the movement of national centralization.\r\n\r\nProgress advances by action and reaction; extremes develop each other.\r\nIt was so in governmental affairs. The movement of unitization ended in\r\nthe absolute power of the sovereign, who became not only the head of the\r\nexecutive function, but the source of legislation as well. In France,\r\nLouis XIV. knew no will but his own; the States General and Parliament\r\nwere little more than empty names; and in England, Parliament stood in\r\nawe of Queen Elizabeth, and the courts did her behests. The sovereigns\r\nwere absolute. But with the culmination of royal prerogative and\r\ncentralized government, there were also an increase of intelligence,\r\ngreater facilities for intercommunication, and, as we have seen, a\r\ndiversity of social and political forces interrelated, and acting and\r\nreacting upon each other in a manner quite unprecedented. The inquiry\r\nand criticism of plebeian minds were becoming more daring, and there was\r\na stir and a restlessness in society, which made bad subjects for an\r\nabsolute monarch. The religious Reformation, which began in Germany and\r\nspread to the westward, was but the legitimate result of the\r\nintellectual agitation which preceded it; and the political absolutism\r\nof kings could no more expect exemption from searching criticism and\r\nfinal revolution than the religious absolutism of the Pope. The German\r\nReformation was blind to the magnitude and significance of its own\r\nmission; for while its leaders denounced reason, it was in its essential\r\nnature a protest against priestly domination over intellect, and a plea\r\nfor the right of free inquiry. Agitation, of whatever kind, is\r\ncontagious; and the energetic play of this diversity of plebeian forces\r\nmust needs result in the recognition of a popular element in the\r\ngovernment, more or less formal in its character. The government of an\r\nintelligent people must emanate from the popular will, to a very great\r\nextent, whatever the form of government may be. If Queen Elizabeth and\r\nLouis XIV. were more absolute than the sovereigns of our day, it was\r\nbecause the French and English people had not then developed that\r\nversatility of genius, that intelligence and freedom of inquiry, that\r\nself-appreciation and dignity of character for which they have since\r\nbecome so conspicuous. With the increase of intelligence and\r\nself-respect among the people, there originated a popular branch of\r\ngovernment to look after their interests, and it grew with their growth.\r\nThrough this channel there came a pressure upon the throne, which must\r\nneeds yield, or be overturned by the surges of revolution. The examples\r\nof Charles I. and Louis XVI. were extreme. The popular element has since\r\nthen usually accomplished its ends with less turbulence and commotion.\r\nIt has been less violent, but none the less effective. Since the\r\nRestoration in England, the popular will has been making itself felt in\r\nnational affairs more and more. And in France, even a Napoleon, mighty\r\nand original as he was, had to consult popular tastes, and, in a great\r\nmeasure, conform thereto. We have heard a great deal about the tyranny\r\nand usurpation of Louis Napoleon; but he, too, must conform to the\r\npredominance of public feeling in France, or that public\r\nfeeling--'public opinion'--would burst out in a torrent of revolution\r\nwhich would overwhelm him. This introduction of the popular element into\r\ngovernment is a result of the developing process, which has made\r\ngovernment an organism of almost infinite complexity.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, while primitive peoples remained in an isolated and\r\nexclusively individualistic condition, there were few civil interests;\r\nand these few the sovereign was not concerned with, so that he could\r\ndischarge in person all the functions of his simple government. But,\r\nwhen the civil interests had grown into greater magnitude and diversity,\r\nand the pressure of their administration was upon the throne, the\r\naffairs of government became too burdensome for one man. A division of\r\nlabor became necessary. The order of priests originated at an early day,\r\nand took charge of religion. The king, in time, ceased to march at the\r\nhead of his army, and sent his generals instead. Not being able to hear\r\nand decide all causes, he named judges to administer justice; and thus\r\nthe process of functional differentiation began, and kept on without\r\nabatement as the needs of the government required. There was a time when\r\nan Englishman had no conception of a prime minister. (Hume.) In this age\r\nwe cannot conceive of government without such a functionary, whether\r\nadministered in the name of king or president. With the development of\r\nnew interests arose new branches in the administration of government.\r\nThe constant rise of new industrial elements; the increasing demand for\r\nthe facilities of intercommunication; the development of trade and\r\ncommerce; the interrelation of interests within, and the complication of\r\naffairs without, have given rise to new departments in the government,\r\nwith a hierarchy of subordinate bureaus; while the interests of towns,\r\ncounties, and states have necessitated an analogous scale of\r\nfunctionaries, making, on the whole, an amazing complication of\r\ngovernmental machinery. This increase of complexity is precisely\r\nanalogous to the order of development in every department of nature; it\r\nis perfectly in accordance with the second feature of the law which we\r\nhave recognized as a Law of Universal Development.\r\n\r\nSome of our economists may object on principle to so much complexity,\r\nand attempt to simplify government by eliminating certain terms of the\r\nseries. Let them try it; GOD is mightier than they! There may be\r\ngovernmental abuse in regard to the complexity of its functions; but the\r\nthing itself is simply in the order of destiny. Man develops it, because\r\nhe _must_; it is the historical result of the accumulation of all human\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nThere is one kind of simplification, however, which should be closely\r\nobserved; and that is to accomplish the object of any governmental\r\nfunction in the most _direct_ and economical manner. There is great room\r\nfor improvement in this respect. Nature, in the midst of all her growing\r\ncomplexities, exemplifies the principle of the greatest possible result\r\nwith the greatest possible economy of means, considering in all cases\r\nthe obstacles to be overcome. Let government do the same, and see that\r\nevery channel of official activity be thoroughly purged of corruption\r\nand abuse.\r\n\r\nThis development of organic complexity is just as necessary and\r\ninevitable in the political as in the animal economy; and the\r\nperformance of any function, in the one case as in the other, depends\r\nfor the degree of its completeness on the extent to which 'the division\r\nof labor' is carried through the complexity of the organic structure.\r\nThere are no grounds of apprehension from this source whatever. In\r\nregard to government, this increase of complexity is most strikingly\r\nobservable in the executive department; and it is worthy of notice that\r\nwhile this department of government is in general becoming less\r\ntyrannical and relatively weaker with reference to the legislative\r\ndepartment, it is also becoming more complex: as tyranny recedes,\r\ncomplexity advances. There is no point better sustained in history than\r\nthe general fact that, as government increases the multiplicity of its\r\nmachinery, it gradually relaxes its interference with the private rights\r\nof individuals.\r\n\r\nAfter man has laid aside his primitive habits of selfish isolation, and,\r\nthough still rude and untutored, has come, through the mere increase of\r\nnumbers, into a more compact form of society, the government, however\r\ncircumscribed as to territorial limits, assumes a despotic and\r\nintermeddling character. Such was the government of the feudal lords\r\nduring the middle ages, and of the kings at a still later day. Laws were\r\nmade for the regulation of dress, as to quality and cut for particular\r\nclasses, and the number of garments which any person might have in a\r\nyear. Citizens were not allowed to keep certain kinds of furniture; and\r\nthe dishes they might have for dinner and supper respectively were\r\ndefinitely and rigidly prescribed. The wages of the laborer were fixed\r\nby law to the great advantage of the lordly employer: this, however, was\r\na very natural sequence to the abolition of villanage or vassal\r\nservitude. The law made service at particular trades compulsory; and\r\ndecided where certain kinds of manufacturing should be carried on; and\r\nhow an article should be made, and how sold when made. This interference\r\naffected every department of the individual's private life. Religious\r\ninterference need only be mentioned; it is well known. As Buckle\r\ndeclares, in speaking of the interference of governments, 'It may be\r\nemphatically said that they have taxed the human mind. They have made\r\nthe very thoughts of men pay toll.' Queen Elizabeth was a very great\r\nsovereign, but she meddled with very small matters. She disliked the\r\nsmell of woad, a plant used for blue dye, and thereupon prohibited its\r\ncultivation. She was displeased with long swords and high ruffs, and\r\ncommissioned her officers to break the swords and abate the ruffs. None\r\nof the nobility dared marry without her consent; no one could travel\r\nwithout her permission. Foreign commerce was subject to her capricious\r\nwill. The star chamber, the court of high commission, the court martial,\r\nthe warrants of the secretary of state and privy council, were\r\ninstruments of terror to the subject, who had no remedy by law. There\r\nwas no safety but for harmless stupidity or slavish conformity.\r\nIndividual independence was impossible. Every noble, manly head that\r\nappeared above the servile mass, was unceremoniously hid away in a\r\ndungeon, or struck off on a scaffold.\r\n\r\nSuch annoying and insolent meddling on the part of governments no longer\r\nexists. There can be no such thing among an enlightened people. As the\r\nmass of mankind, or we will say their leaders or representatives, become\r\nmore cultured, they demand a larger field of individual freedom, and\r\norganize a pressure upon government, which in time effects its object,\r\nand the oppression is removed, or gradually becomes relaxed and\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\nObserving that the differentiation of function obtains chiefly in the\r\nadministrative department of government, and putting the two general\r\nfacts of history together,--first, that while the subject is enlarging\r\nthe domain of individual liberty, and secondly, the government becoming\r\nmore complex in structure and activity,--we infer that, through the\r\nadvance of general intelligence and the multiplication of interests,\r\ngovernment is changing its character from an instrument of compulsion\r\nand force to an instrument of management and direction, wielded by the\r\ngoverned themselves for the benefit of their own diversified and\r\ninterrelated interests.\r\n\r\nIn following the course of individuality, we find it simple and almost\r\nabsolute in savage life; then it is overpowered and disappears under the\r\ndespotic and one-idea governments of ancient times, and of Asia still;\r\nat length it reappears, and gathers strength with every advancing age,\r\nwith every discovery, with every improvement, with every flash of\r\nintelligence, till it has accumulated, in its course, all the\r\ndiversified means of expression and gratification afforded by art,\r\nliterature, and all the social appliances of a complex and exalted form\r\nof society;--and the end is not yet: there will be more freedom, other\r\nmethods of expression, new facilities for enjoyment and happiness. Its\r\ndestiny is a glorious one!\r\n\r\nIt may be well in this connection to recall to mind the principle that,\r\nwith the rise of new functions and the increase of complexity, _unity\r\nobtains its completest form and fullest expression_. These two elements\r\nare by no means antagonistic; they belong together, and one necessitates\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIt is a general fact of history that there is a relation between the\r\nculture of a people and the geographical extent of their voluntary\r\ncombinations. Whilst rude and uncultivated, with no facilities for\r\nintercommunication, they form no permanent associations of any\r\nconsiderable magnitude; but with the advance of general intelligence,\r\nthe rise of distinct classes and industrial and commercial interests,\r\ntogether with the improvement of facilities for travel and trade, and\r\nfor the intercommunication of thought and feeling, there is developed a\r\ngeneral bond of sympathy between larger masses of mankind, and the\r\nnatural result is more extensive combination. The unity becomes more\r\ncomprehensive. We have observed this in our glance at European\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nLet us trace the course of one of the lines of political movement. In a\r\nprimitive society, as among the ancient Germans, each individual has\r\nthe right of avenging himself, of taking justice into his own hands,\r\nand determining what the measure of satisfaction shall be. The right of\r\nprivate war, derived from rude society, remained for a long time in\r\nWestern Europe, and pertained to the clergy as well as to laymen--a\r\ncustom which was withal not very Christian-like. A step beyond this, and\r\nthere was recognized a regular method of determining the amount of\r\nsatisfaction due for an injury: composition for crime became fixed. We\r\nobserve here a development from absolute individuality in the matter of\r\ndetermining justice to the recognition of a conventionalism--a law which\r\nwas the product of the sense of many individuals acting, it may have\r\nbeen, in some cases, without conscious concert, yet in a social and\r\ncooeperative way. As mankind grew out of their original rude conditions,\r\nthey relinquished the individual prerogative of taking justice into\r\ntheir own hands, and appealed therefore to a tribunal which was\r\nrecognized as adequate to this end, and the jurisdiction of which seems\r\nto have had a constant tendency to enlarge its territorial limits. Thus,\r\nfor a time, the feudal barons claimed the final adjudication of all\r\ndifficulties among their own vassals; but, gradually, dissatisfied\r\nclients appealed to the king, who encouraged them to do so, and at\r\nlength the throne became the universally recognized centre and source of\r\nall formal justice.\r\n\r\nThis was a movement occupying centuries for its consummation, a movement\r\nwhich extended the jurisdiction of the tribunal of justice from the\r\nterritory of a private individual to the territory of an entire kingdom,\r\ncollecting the isolated jurisdictions of every individual in barbarian\r\nsociety, and uniting them all together in the recognized sovereign of a\r\nconsolidated nation.\r\n\r\nNow, while it is true that 'the history of progress is the history of\r\nsuccessful struggles against coercion and authoritative direction, and\r\nin favor of human spontaneity and free motion' (Slack); it is also true,\r\nas we have seen in tracing the course of the administration of justice,\r\nthat 'the progress of civilization consists in the substitution of the\r\ngeneral for the individual will, of legal for individual resistance.'\r\n(Guizot.)\r\n\r\nThe development of law, or of a general method, is the necessary result\r\nof social interchange, through which thoughts and feelings become\r\ncontagious and mould a general will. In primitive society, individuals\r\nare isolated, and it matters little to others what any individual does;\r\nhence he is allowed to settle his own difficulties in his own way. He is\r\nlet alone in a way so terrible, that similar treatment would be social\r\ndeath to a man of culture. We repeat, there is nothing like absolute\r\nindividuality, except among isolated and unsocial savages. In an\r\nadvanced state of society, human interests become interrelated--a\r\ncomplete network of complexity; and what any particular individual does\r\nbecomes a matter of interest to many, since the many are, to a certain\r\nextent, affected thereby. The individual of civilization has developed\r\nrelations external to himself, and his rights can only be secured and\r\nhis tastes and wants gratified by mutual understanding, cooeperation, and\r\ncombination. His individuality is of a far higher order than that of the\r\nuncultivated man; and precisely because it is higher, does it develop\r\nlaw as the embodiment of the general will, and require organization for\r\nits expression. 'It is through association that the highest form of\r\nindividuation becomes possible; and nationality wisely developed will\r\nterminate in a cosmopolitan identity of interests, and a general unity\r\nfounded upon a reciprocity of services among all the divisions of\r\nmankind.' (Slack.)\r\n\r\nIt is owing to this same fact of the interrelation and dependence of\r\ninterests, that the movement of unitization has not stopped in Europe\r\nwith the organization of a distinct government for each nation. We have\r\nobserved that when primitive individuals develop relations with each\r\nother, they form into small societies, and that when these develop\r\nrelations with like societies, they unite and form larger associations;\r\nand further, that these states, cities, baronies, come at length to\r\ndevelop relations with each other, and the result is their union into\r\nkingdoms. But this tendency of growth does not cease here. One nation\r\ncannot long remain isolated and distinct from other nations. The\r\ninterests of one kingdom become, in many ways, interrelated with the\r\ninterests of other kingdoms; and there must be new governmental\r\nappliances to meet the case. Diplomacy, a new function of government,\r\narose from this necessity. This is a political activity of quite recent\r\ndevelopment: it originated in the fifteenth century. Like all\r\nprogressive developments, it was at first immature; 'it was not till the\r\nseventeenth century that it became really systematic; before then it had\r\nnot brought about long alliances, great combinations, and especially\r\ncombinations of a durable nature, directed by fixed principles, with a\r\nsteady object, and with that spirit of consistency which forms the true\r\ncharacter of established government.' (Guizot.)\r\n\r\nWho can say that we have yet seen the end of this process of national\r\ndevelopment? Centuries have been required for all great changes\r\naffecting the destiny of man: the centuries of the great Future may yet\r\ndevelop a unity among the nations themselves--a distinct political\r\norganism for the regulation of national interests, which are constantly\r\nbecoming more interrelated and complex. As cities, states, and baronies\r\nwere developed from individuals and tribes, and as kingdoms were\r\ndeveloped from cities, states, and baronies, so may a mightier political\r\nfabric than has yet been known be developed from the family of nations!\r\n\r\nThe law, we repeat, is, that with the advance of social dependence and\r\ncomplexity, the principle of unitization becomes practically more\r\nintimate and comprehensive. _It is to this law that nations owe that\r\nvitality_ of which diplomatists and constitutional lawyers take\r\ncognizance. By virtue of this law, a nation is a living organism,\r\nresisting with all its vital force whatever may threaten it with\r\ndissolution. Hence the utter folly of cherishing the idea of a\r\n'peaceable separation' of confederated states. There can be no such\r\nthing in the order of nature. The rupture and division of a nation is a\r\nreaction against the spirit of social progress, a backward movement\r\nagainst the current of civilization, a terrible outrage to the\r\norganizing forces of the political realm, and can only be effected\r\nthrough violence and bloodshed. The more mature civilization becomes,\r\nthe more difficult to effect disunion, the more terrible the penalty,\r\nand the more enduring, discordant, and wretched the consequences.\r\n\r\nThe law of unitization is a universal one, being an accompaniment of all\r\nunfolding, and man worse than wastes his energy in fighting against it.\r\nIt is a great law of Universal Progress; and in lifting our hands\r\nagainst it, we are presuming to measure arms with a Power which will be\r\nsure to overwhelm us with confusion and defeat. We must consent to go\r\nwith the grand movements of the Universe, and to march to the step of\r\nDestiny, or be crushed under the resistless tread of advancing peoples!\r\n\r\nThe course of industrial, mechanical, and commercial progress from\r\nsavage to civilized life, goes to illustrate and confirm the view which\r\nwe have taken of the course of political development.\r\n\r\nAmong the least cultivated tribes of mankind, the family is wholly\r\nadequate to itself, there being no dissimilarity of industrial function,\r\nexcept between the husband and wife. The family builds its own hut,\r\nmakes its own weapons, kills its own game--in short, provides for all\r\nits own needs. What is industrially true of one family is true of all\r\nothers; there is no division of labor, no exchange of products. They\r\nhave no accumulated property, no fixed habitation, but wander from place\r\nto place, as the attractions of their simple life may lead them. But\r\nwhen population becomes more numerous, and neither hunting nor pasturage\r\nis sufficient for their support, the cultivation of the soil is resorted\r\nto, and new wants are developed. The division of labor, the\r\ndifferentiation of the industrial function begins. One man cultivates\r\nthe soil, another works in iron, another in wood, and so on; and these\r\nspecialities, in their turn, assume new branches. Take agriculture for\r\nexample: At first every husbandman grows all that he needs for himself\r\nand family; after a while he observes that his soil is better adapted to\r\none kind of crop than another, and he devotes himself more exclusively\r\nto its cultivation. A similar result with a different crop obtains on a\r\ndifferent soil and in a different locality; and thus do the specialities\r\nof soil and climate result in the specialization of agriculture. These\r\ndiversities of occupation with reference to the soil, wood, metals,\r\nimply the exchange of products; but this must obtain to a very limited\r\nextent while neighbors are remote, and the means of travel and\r\ntransportation defective. With few roads, and commerce undeveloped,\r\nthere is little intercommunication, little culture, little civilization.\r\nThis was the condition of Scotland as late as the middle of the\r\neighteenth century. (Buckle.) England had some external commerce as\r\nearly as the thirteenth century (Hallam), but did not send a ship of her\r\nown into the Mediterranean till the fifteenth. (Robertson.) Think of the\r\ndifference between then and now!\r\n\r\nThe making of tools, implements, and fabrics is at first carried on\r\nsolely by individuals working alone, but at length, machinery comes into\r\nuse, the elements are used as driving power, and manufacturing\r\nestablishments arise having a complicated organization. The division of\r\nlabor has been all the time becoming more complete, till now a single\r\nworkman manages but a part of the process of making an implement or a\r\nfabric, which must pass through many hands in succession before it is\r\ncompleted. All are familiar with this fact. It is exactly analogous to\r\nthat which we observe in the animal economy. Low in the zoological\r\nscale, one membrane performs all the organic functions; higher in the\r\nscale, there are different organs to perform the distinct functions.\r\nWhen the stomach and liver first appear, they are very simple in\r\nstructure, and as simple in function; it is just so with the\r\nmanufactories in the industrial organism. But the stomach and liver\r\nbecome more complicated as the scale rises; it is just so with the\r\nmanufactories as civilization advances. Animals lowest in the scale have\r\nno heart--no circulation. It is just so with society--if society it may\r\nbe called--which is lowest in the scale; it has no exchange of\r\nproducts--no commercial circulation. The parallelism is complete.\r\n\r\nFurther, as already specified, we find in the animal organism, that the\r\ndependence of parts and functions upon each other becomes greater with\r\nthe increase of complexity; that unitization at the top of the scale, in\r\nthe midst of an almost infinite complication of organic structures and\r\nfunctions, has a completeness and significance which it cannot have in\r\nthe simple organism at the bottom of the scale. The same precisely is\r\ntrue of the social organism. At the bottom of the scale, there is no\r\ndependence of one part on another--no cooeperation--no proper\r\nunity--nothing but simple individual life. Higher in the scale, there is\r\ndependence of one element of society on another; there must be\r\ncooeperation, combination, organization, a tendency, at least, toward\r\nunity.\r\n\r\nThis is well exemplified by industrial and commercial development. With\r\nregard to manufacturing, there is specialization, not only in the\r\nhandiwork, but also in the locality of production. Thus, in Great\r\nBritain, where this development has most fully matured itself, 'the\r\ncalico manufacture locates itself in this county, the woollen-cloth\r\nmanufacture in that; silks are produced here, lace there, stockings in\r\none place, shoes in another; pottery, hardware, cutlery, come to have\r\ntheir special towns; and ultimately, every locality becomes more or less\r\ndistinguished from the rest by the leading occupation carried on in it.\r\nNay, more, this subdivision of functions shows itself, not only among\r\nthe different parts of the same nation, but among different nations.'\r\n(Westminster Review.) Some of our economists object to this process, and\r\nwould bring all kinds of productive labor into the same district; but a\r\nlaw higher than their theories brings artisans of the same kind into the\r\nneighborhood of each other;--it is the cooeperative action of the\r\nprinciples of differentiation and unitization.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this process is to make one locality dependent on another\r\nlocality. Once, as we have seen, the family was adequate to its own\r\nneeds; now, we perceive the industrial producers of one district have\r\nbecome dependent on each other, and on the products of other districts\r\nand nations, for the supply of their needs. This industrial division and\r\nconcentration gives increased importance to commerce, without which\r\nthere could be no industrial development. It is thus that these two\r\nactivities are separating the elements of society in order to bind them\r\nthe more firmly together.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of roads, rivers, harbors, the construction of canals,\r\nrailroads, and telegraphs, the development of industry, the extension of\r\ncommerce, the advance of general culture, and the consequent increase of\r\nhuman wants, is making society a very complicated structure;--indeed, it\r\nhas nerve and tissue, and is becoming very sensitive. The loss of a crop\r\nin one country affects all other countries. The burning of a city, or\r\neven of a great manufacturing establishment, is really felt to the\r\nremotest ends of civilization. A commercial crisis on either shore of\r\nthe Atlantic shocks the whole civilized world. A rebellion in the United\r\nStates is affecting the agriculture of the whole country, the production\r\nof a staple on three continents, manufacturing in France and New and Old\r\nEngland, commerce everywhere. Every partisan clique, every political\r\ncourt and cabinet, even political destiny itself, throughout the whole\r\nworld, reels with every surge of a distant revolution! How different\r\nfrom the condition even of Europe in the twelfth century, when a whole\r\ncity or barony, an entire kingdom, or half the continent even, might\r\nhave sunk beneath, the ocean, and the rest of the world have known\r\nnothing of it by its social results!\r\n\r\nThus, as in the undeveloped organism there is a want of dependence and\r\nsensitiveness, so is there the same want in undeveloped society. As in\r\nthe higher organic structures there is a high degree of unity and\r\nsensitiveness, an injury to the remotest part affecting instantaneously\r\nthe whole organism; so, precisely, is the same true of society in its\r\nhigher stages of development. The law is universal; it governs the\r\norganic as well as the inanimate, the social as well as the organic\r\nworld. Hence the reason why the rupture of Europe, on the death of\r\nCharlemagne, into provinces and kingdoms loosely united, could not\r\nprevent the ultimate organization of national government, and the rise\r\nof relations external to the individual nation, out of which diplomacy\r\ngrew, for the consummation of a policy above the nations themselves.\r\nObstructions may be thrown in the way of unitization, but it will\r\nexpress itself in some form or other. If, on account of the viciousness\r\nof primitive conditions from which it has been developed, modern Europe\r\ncannot yet exist as a union of states under one great and glorious\r\ngovernment, it will, nevertheless, approximate that union, as best it\r\ncan, and consummate vast national leagues, which are becoming constantly\r\nmore comprehensive and permanent as civilization advances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_\r\n     it--to not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.'--_Goethe._\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\n     intended.'--_Webster's Dictionary._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nOur hero starts once more with a new field before him--the field where\r\nall his hopes and aspirations have been centred since he first was\r\ncapable of comprehending the shrewd advice of Hiram Bennett, of the firm\r\nof H. Bennett & Co.\r\n\r\nYes, he starts with a new field in view, unencumbered by any love\r\naffair, and free from all entanglements of that nature--indeed, of any\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to be so minute in this history as to give the reader\r\na proper idea of young Meeker at the time he was ready to launch upon\r\nNew-York life. He was now nearly twenty-three years old, and fully\r\ncompetent, by his previous education and experience, to undertake any\r\nkind of business.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett, with whom Hiram had become a great favorite, looked\r\nconfidently to securing him in his establishment. It is true, he had\r\nattempted to make no positive engagement with his namesake in advance,\r\nbut for the last year he always spoke to him as if, in due time, he was\r\nto enter his service as a matter of course. Hiram did not assent nor\r\ndissent to such observations; but, really, he had not the slightest idea\r\nof taking a situation with his cousin. He did not like 'dry goods' to\r\nbegin with. He thought the trade offered too little scope for\r\nenterprise, unless, indeed, one had good foreign connections, and even\r\nthen he had his objections to it. The competition was more active, the\r\ncredits longer, and the risks were greater, than in other commercial or\r\nmercantile pursuits. The question, as you may naturally suppose, had\r\noccupied his serious attention for years; but he kept his counsel, and\r\nnever spoke of his designs.\r\n\r\nThe first that was known of Hiram's whereabouts, he was established as\r\nthe junior clerk in a first-class ship chandler's store in South street.\r\nIt was rather difficult to obtain such a situation; but the reader well\r\nknows that, once in it, Hiram will not fail to merit the approbation of\r\nhis employers.\r\n\r\nSingular to say, he was indebted for the place to that scapegrace Hill.\r\nThe head clerk was Hill's cousin, himself utterly unlike his relation,\r\nyet a good deal attached to him. Hiram, who made it a rule never to lose\r\nsight of anybody, always managed to fall in with Hill (who had quit\r\nJoslin) whenever he came to the city, and on one occasion Hill\r\nintroduced him to this cousin. He managed to make himself very\r\nagreeable, and an intimacy commenced, which ended in Hiram's obtaining\r\nthe place of the junior clerk, who was about leaving. Of course, Hiram\r\ncame backed with the highest recommendations, so that his friend had\r\nreally to assume no responsibility on his behalf. Thus he secured the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nA 'ship chandler!' Reader, have you any idea of his occupation? You have\r\ndoubtless some business notion of commerce, or at least a romantic idea\r\nof ships on the ocean, their sails spread to favorable breezes, or\r\nclosehauled, braving adverse gales--joyous in fine weather, defiant in\r\nthe tempest--yes, you know or feel something about this. But to enable\r\nthe good ship to pursue her way, she must be 'provided.' She must not\r\nonly have wherewithal to feed crew and passengers, but every special\r\nnotion which can be conceived of in the ship's 'husbandry.' From out a\r\nship chandler's establishment comes everything, directly or indirectly,\r\nwhich shall furnish the vessel.\r\n\r\nStep in, and look through such a store. Taking the interest I hope you\r\ndo in Hiram, pray devote a few moments to visiting the place where he\r\nhas resolved to _begin_ his New-York life. You won't find it an\r\nagreeable spot. Nothing to compare with the neat, well-arranged office\r\nat Burnsville--pleasant Burnsville!--nor even as attractive as the\r\ncountry store of Benjamin Jessup, at Hampton. It is dark and\r\ndisagreeable. It smells of tar, bacon, cheese, and cordage, blended with\r\na suspicious odor of bilge water. This last does not really belong to\r\nthe store, but comes from the docks, which are in close proximity. The\r\nplace is ample. It has a large front, runs back deep, and you will find,\r\nif you walk far enough, a respectable counting-room, where the gas is\r\nkept all the time burning. This establishment is managed by three\r\npartners, careful, economical men, who divide a large sum each year in\r\nprofits. They have, it is true, the cream of the trade, for they are\r\nreliable, straightforward people, and can be trusted to fit out a ship\r\nwithout fear that advantage will be taken if they are not closely\r\nwatched. No danger that the pork, when opened ninety days out, will\r\nprove to be rusty, or the beef a little tainted. Hendly, Layton & Gibb\r\nare old-fashioned, respectable people. They have been already twenty\r\nyears together. Hendly keeps the books, Layton makes all the purchases,\r\nGibb fits out the vessels. Levi Eastman (Hill's cousin, Hiram's friend),\r\nnow over ten years in the place, is head man under the firm, having a\r\ngeneral supervision of whatever is going on. He is forty years old at\r\nleast, has a wife, and, some say, in addition to a good salary, enjoys a\r\npercentage on all profits over a certain amount. Hiram Meeker ranks next\r\nto Eastman, though it will take him a few weeks to get familiar with his\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nI will tell you presently what decided Hiram to become clerk to a ship\r\nchandler, I do not intend, after being so communicative, to hide his\r\nmotives on this occasion. I say I will explain presently: meantime, do\r\nnot fear that Hiram has any desire to supplant his friend Eastman, or\r\nget the control of the business of the firm; not at all. Other views,\r\nfar more important, engage his mind--views which he thinks, in this ship\r\nchandler's store, to study and develop to advantage.\r\n\r\nHiram seemed to have altered his tactics on leaving Burnsville. There\r\nhis style of living was considered expensive. His salary was very\r\nliberal, and although he did not spend it all (it was much increased\r\nafter the Joslin affair), he appeared far from calculating in his\r\ndisbursements. Now, this was all changed. Eastman, who had no children,\r\nand with two spare rooms in his house, consented, after consulting his\r\nwife, to take Hiram as a boarder, on more moderate terms than he could\r\npossibly get elsewhere for comfortable accommodations.\r\n\r\nIn this arrangement, Hiram had unquestionably decided to forego the\r\nluxury of pleasant female society. Mrs. Eastman had a sour-looking\r\ncountenance, which did not in the least belie her disposition. In fact,\r\nher husband had a hard time of it, and doubtless thought Hiram's\r\npresence might prove a distraction for him--or for his wife. In either\r\ncase, he would be the gainer, even if Hiram suffered somewhat. The\r\nlatter did not appear to be apprehensive, but made himself at home in\r\nshort order.\r\n\r\nThen, and not before, he called on Mr. Bennett, and told him, ere the\r\nlatter had time to inquire, that he had quit Burnsville, and was now\r\nclerk for Hendly, Layton & Gibb, ship chandlers.\r\n\r\n'Well, that's a move, I declare! Did you suppose I was so full I could\r\nnot make room for you?'\r\n\r\n'Not that; but, you see, I am not going into your line,' said Hiram,\r\nblandly.\r\n\r\nTill that moment Mr. Bennett had himself no idea how much he was\r\ncalculating on Hiram's assistance in his largely increasing business. He\r\nwas greatly disappointed. He was too shrewd, however, to express much\r\nregret. He only said, 'I should have been glad to have had you with me,\r\nbut you know your own business best, I dare say. You will _do_ anywhere,\r\nI guess. Now you are here, come and see us often, and let me know when I\r\ncan be of use to you.'\r\n\r\nKeen men sympathize with keen; knaves with knaves; the good with the\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWhen Sarah Burns, after Hiram's departure, sat down, quietly to think\r\nover the events of the past few days--for during the week he remained in\r\nthe house she had no opportunity for reflection--she was sensible of a\r\nspecies of relief that she was no longer bound to him.\r\n\r\nIt was not permitted in nature nor in God's providence that this fellow\r\nshould have lasting power over one so true hearted. With such, his\r\ninfluence was not to become absolute or controlling.\r\n\r\nThis was Sarah's first love affair, and she had no experience as to her\r\nown emotions, and possessed, therefore, no test by which to judge of\r\ntheir intensity. Now she could look back and see that her heart had not\r\nbeen satisfied.\r\n\r\n'_Not satisfied!_' How many a young girl has been forced bitterly to\r\ntake up this burden--when too late. '_Disappointed!_' How many, when it\r\nis past help, whisper the terrible word in secret to their souls! How\r\nmany are now dragging out a despairing existence, chained to some Hiram\r\nMeeker, with heart-wants never to be filled; with sympathies never to be\r\nresponded to; with rich capacities for loving, which find in return\r\nneither tenderness nor appreciation; with affections, and no lawful\r\nobject;--glowing, earnest natures companioned with calculation and\r\nselfishness and a remorseless subtlety; full, fresh, joyous vitality,\r\nyoked to a living corpse.\r\n\r\nThank God! for Sarah Burns it was not too late.\r\n\r\nIt is true, she persuaded herself she loved Hiram, and that she enjoyed\r\nevery delight which flows from affections mutually pledged. But, really,\r\nit was entirely on one side. He, as we know, utterly selfish, had no\r\ngenuine affection to impart; so all was made up by her. Out of her full\r\nimagination she brought rich treasures, and bestowed them on her lover,\r\nand then, valued him for possessing them.\r\n\r\nStill, for Sarah Burns it was not too late.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, when she came and threw her arms around her father's\r\nneck, and pleaded to come back again to his confidence, she was fully\r\nconvinced of Hiram's real character. From that moment everything was\r\nsettled. She permitted no explanations; for Hiram, when he saw how\r\nsummarily he was to be disposed of, felt not only piqued, but roused, I\r\nmay say, to a certain degree of appreciation of the object he was to\r\nlose so unexpectedly. He believed Sarah was so strongly attached to him\r\nthat she would become reconciled to his going to New York, and then he\r\ncould permit the affair to drag along to suit his convenience, to be\r\nrevived or die out at his pleasure. So all his attempts at a private\r\ninterview, his injured looks, and woful countenance went for nothing.\r\n\r\nSarah treated him precisely as she would treat an ordinary acquaintance,\r\nwhile Mr. Burns was careful to make no allusion to the subject, or\r\npermit the slightest difference in his conduct toward his confidential\r\nclerk. Hiram, therefore, was the one to feel uncomfortable; but the week\r\nwas soon brought to a close, and he departed.\r\n\r\nHe went first to Hampton to visit his home. When the wagon drove to Mr.\r\nBurns's house to receive his luggage, Sarah was entertaining two or\r\nthree young ladies who were paying her a morning visit. I dare say there\r\nwas an object in the call not altogether amiable: namely, to see how\r\nSarah would 'appear' in respect to Hiram's departure, and to find out,\r\nif possible, by the way she bore it, whether or not there was anything\r\nin the rumor of an engagement between them. Hiram had already taken a\r\nmost affectionate leave of each of these young ladies the day before,\r\nand they thought he was to depart early in the morning. Much to their\r\ndisappointment, Sarah Burns never appeared more natural or more at ease.\r\nShe spoke of Hiram's going to New York as a settled plan, determined on\r\neven before he came to Burnsville; and (the trunks were now all in the\r\ncarriage) at length exclaimed, 'Come, girls; I think Hiram must be\r\nwaiting to bid us good-by.'\r\n\r\nThereupon, all went on the piazza, and thus frustrated a design of\r\nHiram of taking a brief but most pathetic and impressive and\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten farewell of his cruel betrothed. He had prepared a\r\nshort speech for the occasion, which he believed would plant a dagger in\r\nher heart. He intended, just as soon as everything was ready, to find\r\nSarah, deliver his speech, then rush to the carriage, and be almost\r\ninstantly lost sight of.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he saw with intense mortification a bevy of girls come\r\nrunning out, each with something to say, and all at once--for, to\r\nconceal any little private feeling of her own, each one was as gay as\r\npossible. At last Hiram was forced to mount the wagon (the trunks filled\r\nall the vacant space, and, besides, were provokingly placed so that his\r\nseat was a most awkward one) and to drive away very unromantically, amid\r\nthe adieus and railleries of the commingled voices.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nFreed from Hiram's disagreeable presence, Sarah Burns, as soon as her\r\nvisitors had left, sat down to _think_; and she experienced, as I have\r\nalready remarked, a species of relief. By degrees her spirits rose to\r\ntheir old, natural level, and then the fact struck her that they had not\r\nof late been so elastic and joyous as formerly. Presently she jumped up,\r\nand, snatching her hat, she resolved to run into the office, as she used\r\nto do in 'old times,' and surprise her father by a little visit. She\r\ntripped cheerfully out, and was soon at the office door. Here she\r\npaused. Her heart beat loudly, but it was with pleasure. Then she\r\nquietly opened the door and stepped in.\r\n\r\n'Good morning, sir,' she exclaimed. 'Here is your old clerk back again.'\r\n\r\nShe rushed up and gave him a kiss, and received a dozen in return.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns used afterward to say it was the most blissful moment of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAfter that, how they enjoyed themselves!--like school children let\r\nloose. Sarah ran up, and down, and around the office, through the front\r\nroom and the little room back, then in the closets, her father\r\nfollowing, as much of a child as she--his heart also freed of a load,\r\nand his soul filled with sunshine--no Hiram Meeker to cast a baleful\r\nshadow over it.\r\n\r\nThere were not any explanations between those two. Explanations were not\r\nin the least necessary. Each felt that all _was_ explained, and all was\r\nright and happy again. That was enough.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, some one came in to see Mr. Burns on business, and Sarah\r\ntook her departure. With a light heart she retraced her steps toward\r\nhome. She had reached the memorable corner where she once encountered\r\nHiram--it was on his first visit to Burnsville--when, quite abruptly, as\r\nit seemed, a tall, handsome young man stood directly in her way.\r\n\r\nShe stopped, of course; she could not do otherwise, unless she chose to\r\nrun into the arms of the stranger. A pair of bright, dark eyes were\r\nturned inquiringly on her.\r\n\r\n'I have found you at last,' said the young man, in a pleasant tone. 'I\r\nhave just left your house. I did not think you would be out so early.\r\nAnd now that we do meet,' he continued, 'I perceive you don't know me:\r\nthat is too bad!'\r\n\r\nSarah stood like one in a trance. At first she thought the man was\r\nderanged; but he looked so handsome and so intelligent, she quickly\r\nabandoned that hypothesis. Then she began to think she was a little out\r\nof her wits herself. That seemed to her more probable.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there he stood, directly and squarely in her path. He\r\nappeared rather to enjoy Sarah's perplexity.\r\n\r\n'Yes, it is unkind in you to forget an old friend--one you promised to\r\nremember always.'\r\n\r\nSarah was beginning to recover herself. It was evident, from the whole\r\nappearance of the stranger, that he would not adopt this singular mode\r\nof addressing her, unless he had some claim to her acquaintance. So she\r\nreasoned. Resolving she would no longer play the part of a bashful miss,\r\nshe said: 'I am very sorry to be obliged to confess it; but, really, I\r\nhave not the slightest recollection of you.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, that is the way with the sex!' continued the other, in the same\r\ntone. 'Who would have thought it? After bestowing on me such a precious\r\ntoken (here he presented a locket, in which he exhibited a curl of\r\nhair), you now propose to ignore me altogether.'\r\n\r\n'I am inclined to think you are the one in error. I am quite sure you\r\nmistake me for some other person,' retorted Sarah, quietly.\r\n\r\n'Possibly. Therefore, permit me to inquire whether or not I have the\r\nhonor of addressing Miss Sarah Burns?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Yet you have no recollection of presenting me with this?'\r\n\r\n'You must have shown me the wrong locket,' said Sarah, dryly. 'The hair\r\nis several shades lighter than mine.'\r\n\r\n'True, I did not think of that,' said the mysterious young gentleman.' I\r\nought to have known it would be so; but it never occurred to me.\r\nGood-by!'\r\n\r\nHe bowed courteously and passed on his way, leaving Sarah in complete\r\nbewilderment. She walked slowly toward home. She roused her memory. She\r\nwent through the list of her acquaintances. She endeavored to recall\r\nthose she had encountered when taking some little trips with her\r\nfather--but the stranger was not any of these.\r\n\r\nA faint outline was, nevertheless, before her. A shadowy image, the\r\nsame, yet not the same, with the young man who had stood in her path.\r\n\r\n'Who? where? when?'\r\n\r\nIn vain she asked herself the questions.\r\n\r\nOver the past hangs a dim uncertainty, like that which veils the future,\r\nand, young as Sarah was, she could already realize it. At length she\r\nstopped her efforts, and recurred to the more pleasing task of thinking\r\nabout the young gentleman as he now appeared, without respect to any\r\nother circumstance. She recalled his manly form. He was nearly six feet\r\nin height. How bright his eyes were, and how mischievously they were\r\nturned on her, yet how kindly--she was almost ready to think\r\nlovingly--when the locket was produced! What about that locket? She\r\nnever gave anybody a locket, never--not even Hiram Meeker. Faugh! It\r\nsickened her to think of _him_ now, and in this connection. Only imagine\r\nit! A lock of her hair. How ridiculous! No living being had a lock of\r\n_her_ hair. She knew that well enough. Besides, this was so much\r\nlighter--as light as hers was when she was a child. A sudden thought\r\nstruck her. Strange; how very, _very_ strange! Yet, it was true. Once in\r\nher life she _had_ given a single curl! Was this it? Had she promised\r\nanything with the curl? And was this young man he? Sarah's heart beat\r\ntumultuously as she entered the house. She reflected on the words of the\r\nstranger as he turned to leave her. Should she see him again? * * *\r\n\r\nA message came from her father. He would bring a gentleman to dine with\r\nhim--that was all.\r\n\r\nWho would it be? the one she had lately parted with? Not a doubt of it.\r\n_That_ she felt instinctively.\r\n\r\nOn a certain occasion, as the reader may remember, Sarah had\r\nimperceptibly prepared herself to receive Hiram Meeker. It was the first\r\ntime he took tea at the house. This day she did the very same thing to\r\nreceive somebody else. There is no use to deny it, for such is the fact.\r\nYet it was but a short week since she was the betrothed of Hiram, and\r\nbelieved she loved him. That very morning they had separated forever!\r\n\r\nIt often happens that a young girl is deceived by or disappointed in her\r\nadmirer. They may prove to be incompatible, or, what is worse, he may\r\nprove unworthy; and she discards him, but with reluctance, after a\r\nstruggle, leaving a pang in her heart, while she mourns over her lost\r\n_love_--not lover. _Him_ she no longer regards with any feeling; but the\r\nmemory of the old attachment is dear to her, though it be sad, and time\r\nis required before the heart will be attracted by new objects, or seek\r\nto be engrossed by a fresh passion.\r\n\r\nThe bond between Hiram and Sarah was of no such nature. He exercised a\r\nspecies of magnetism over her, in consequence of her lively and\r\nsympathetic nature; but it was of a kind that, when broken, neither\r\npleasing nor mournful reminiscences remained--no recollection of past\r\njoys, no thought of former happiness and bliss. The fountains of the\r\nheart had not been reached, and when Hiram Meeker quitted her presence,\r\nshe was as though she had never known him.\r\n\r\nThus it was, when she received her father's message, her pulses thrilled\r\nat the idea of meeting the one he was to bring with him.\r\n\r\nAlready she guessed who it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Poets are never in the wrong,\r\n     Whate'er the present age may say:\r\n   The future only, in their song,\r\n     Will see the truth of this our day;\r\n   And what a BRYANT says and sings\r\n     May well outweigh all false-born things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICAL SURVEY OF NEW YORK HARBOR AND ITS APPROACHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo coast offers more admirable opportunities for the study, on a large\r\nscale, of the effects of winds, waves, and currents, tidal and others,\r\non the movable matters which line the ocean shores, than that from New\r\nYork southward. Besides the peculiar local actions, there are general\r\nones, which are changing, slowly or rapidly, the whole of the sandy\r\ncoast line. While here the pebbles of the ancient drift are being\r\nassorted by size and shape, and rolled into ridges and heaps, by the\r\naction of the waves, there heaps and ridges of wet sand are formed by\r\nthe waves and travel under their motion, and the dry sand is forced\r\nalong by the winds, covering up meadows and woods, and changing the\r\nocean shore line; and in other or the same localities, sub-currents,\r\nsetting in a nearly constant general direction, roll onward the movable\r\nmaterials of the bottom of the sea, or tidal currents roll them forward\r\nand backward, giving the general direction of the resulting motion.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Government and State engineers and commissioners,\r\npublic and private, who have studied the improvements of different\r\nlocalities, have given us glimpses of the local, and even of the general\r\nactions; but most commonly there has been a want of means or such\r\npreliminary experiments as were necessary fully to develop the actions,\r\nand which, like the stitch which saves nine, would often have saved the\r\ncostly experiment on the full scale of construction. Remarkable\r\ninstances of complete modes of investigation occur in the examination of\r\nthe Mississippi River by Captain A.A. Humphreys and Lieutenant Abbot, of\r\nthe Topographical Engineers, and by the commission of which General\r\nTotten, Prof. Bache, and Admiral Davis were members. As most familiar to\r\nme, from having taken an official part in the experiments and\r\nobservations made, I propose to notice the Physical Surveys of New York\r\nand Boston, indicating the chief agents which are at work in destroying\r\nand building up, so as to produce the present condition of these\r\nimportant ports.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn connection with the surveys made a few years since by direction of\r\nthe Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments, there was undertaken, as an\r\nincidental inquiry, an investigation into the physical conditions under\r\nwhich the shoals and beaches in and about New York harbor had submitted\r\nto those changes of position and area which the repeated surveys\r\nrevealed. It was at the request of these Commissioners that Professor\r\nBache, the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, gave his personal\r\nattention to this subject. He drew up a comprehensive scheme for a\r\nseries of observations upon all the natural agencies at work, and, for\r\nthe execution of the project, selected one of his assistants, whose\r\nexperience had already been considerable in similar studies.\r\n\r\nThe investigation was commenced in the lower harbor early in the spring\r\nof 1856. Records were kept of tides, currents, winds, and waves, and the\r\nmost careful notes were made on the immediate effects of these working\r\nagents as observable in the movements of the sands.\r\n\r\nA glance at a general coast chart discovers at once a marked contrast\r\nbetween two different sections of our seaboard: to the eastward of us,\r\nthe principal harbors of New England are rockbound, with elevated back\r\ncountries; while to the southward, in the region of alluvial drift,\r\nwhich extends all along the coast of the Middle and Southern States, the\r\nharbors have flat and sandy shores. The harbor and neighborhood of New\r\nYork, holding an intermediate position between these diverse sections,\r\nexhibit a singular combination of the leading physical features of both,\r\nand present to the hydrographer a field for research that is quite\r\nwithout a parallel.\r\n\r\nWe recognize in the Bar of New York simply a submerged portion of that\r\n_sandy cordon_ which skirts the coast from Montauk Point to Florida; and\r\nalthough, in the ordinary sense, the lower entrance to the harbor is not\r\nan _inlet_, it may nevertheless be regarded as belonging to the same\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThis _sandy cordon_, which may be said to be the principal\r\ncharacteristic of our coast, is an exceedingly interesting feature; it\r\nappears to have been formed by the action of the sea, which has\r\ndisintegrated the borders of shallow flats, bearing away the light\r\nvegetable moulds, but suffering the coarse quartz sand to remain rolled\r\nup into ridges. In many places the dry winds have caught up these sands,\r\nwhen laid bare at low water, and elevated them into dunes or galls.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the sand ridge from the mainland is observed to vary\r\nwith the slope of the adjacent country. It is the _motion of\r\ntranslation_ which a wave acquires on reaching shallow water, that gives\r\nit such great capacity for the transportation of material.\r\n\r\nThis _translative action_, as it is technically called, commences\r\nordinarily in about three fathoms water, and is most violent in six or\r\neight feet depths, within which the sea breaks. It is just within the\r\nbreaker that the windrows of sand are observed to form on exposed flats.\r\n\r\nThis disposition of the sea to cast up well defined boundaries of sand\r\nalong its margin, is so great and persistent, that the inland waters are\r\ndammed up and suffered only to escape into the ocean by narrow avenues,\r\nwhere their rapid currents maintain a supremacy of power--albeit with\r\nunceasing contest.\r\n\r\nWherever, along our coast, the waves drive _obliquely_ upon the beach, a\r\nmovement of the sand takes place, and the inlets are consequently\r\ncontinually shifting.\r\n\r\nThe Long Island inlets are moving _westward_, and Sandy Hook advances to\r\nthe _northward_, because the sea rolls in along the axis of the great\r\nbay between Long Island and New Jersey, and necessarily sweeps along the\r\nbeaches, instead of taking the direction of a _normal_ to the shore\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe movement of Sandy Hook to the northward is, however, a problem not\r\nso easily disposed of as we might conceive from the above\r\nconsiderations; for although, in the most general sense, its existence\r\nmust be regarded as the work of the waves, there are other agents\r\ninfluencing materially its form and its rate of progress. The currents\r\ncontrol, to a very great extent, the final disposition of the sands worn\r\naway or kept in motion by the waves.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bache's investigations in the neighborhood of Sandy Hook have\r\nbeen published, and we should not especially refer to them here, except\r\nthat the recent physical changes reported by Colonel Delafield to the\r\nEngineer Department, have reawakened an interest in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of the Coast Survey, made in 1856 and 1857, showed that\r\nthe Hook was being washed away on the east and west shores, but was\r\nextending slowly to the northwest, where it already encroached on the\r\nmain ship channel. This order of things has continued up to the present\r\ntime, and is now in progress.\r\n\r\nThe able Superintendent of the fortifications at Sandy Hook has evinced\r\nconsiderable alarm lest the new fort shall fall a prey to the\r\nencroachments, or be separated from the main body of the beach by\r\nslue-ways. The Coast Surrey has been notified of the matter, and the\r\nassistant to whom I have already referred has visited the Hook, and made\r\nan informal report, which agrees essentially with the statements of\r\nColonel Delafield. A complete and reliable report can only be made upon\r\n_actual surveys_; and we trust these will be executed, and the\r\nGovernment placed in possession of the whole truth.\r\n\r\nWe understand that Colonel Delafield has already, upon a small scale,\r\nmade some very successful experiments of curvilineal dikes, constructed\r\nwith caissons of concrete; and we have no doubt that, with adequate\r\nmeans at his disposal, this ingenious engineer could avert the dangers\r\nwhich threaten, not only the fort, but the noble harbor of New York.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Physical Survey, and to speak as briefly as we may upon\r\nso extended a subject, we hold that it is possible, by a patient\r\ncollection of facts and figures, to determine the natural _scheme_ of\r\nthe harbor--we had almost said the _formula of its development_.\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained that the group of shoals which form the Bar--composed,\r\nas they are, for the most part, of loose and shifting sands--are not\r\naccidental accumulations, modified by violent storms and freshets, but\r\nthat they are orderly arrangements, made by the currents, to whose\r\nunceasing activities are due the form and preservation of each bank and\r\nchannel. The peculiar contours of the shoals given by our most ancient\r\ncharts are still developed by recent surveys, although alterations in\r\nmagnitude have taken place. _The order of the physical forces is\r\nunchanged, but their work is still progressing._\r\n\r\nNow, since these currents have determinable laws, regulating their\r\nperiods, durations, velocities, and directions, it was only necessary to\r\ncompile observations, in order to reduce this study to a simple\r\nconsideration of the _composition of forces_.\r\n\r\n'The process by which sand is swept along by currents upon the bottom of\r\nthe sea, is not unlike the motion of dunes upon the land; a ridge of\r\nsand is propagated in the direction of the current by the continual\r\nrolling of the particles from the rear to the front. This movement is\r\nexceedingly slow when compared with that of the current which induces\r\nit, and for this reason a shoal, though traversed by violent tidal\r\ncurrents, may, as a whole, remain stationary when the alternate drifts\r\nare equal and opposite; for in this case, though the sand upon the\r\nsurface is drifted to and fro, it undergoes no more ultimate change of\r\nposition than it would if the forces which acted upon it were\r\nsimultaneous and in equilibrium.'[9]\r\n\r\nOf course, so simple a case as that in which the ebb and flood forces\r\nare equal and opposite, is rarely presented; for at most of the stations\r\non the Bar the direction of the flow varies from hour to hour, going\r\nquite round the circle in a half-tidal day: the velocities and\r\ndirections also vary with the depth. These circumstances complicate the\r\ncomputation a little, but the problem is still simple and direct.\r\nEverything depends upon the faithfulness of the observations.\r\n\r\nThe physical diagrams which have been plotted from the results of these\r\nstudies may be regarded as decided successes, for they show in most\r\ncases that the shoals lie in the foci or in the equilibrium points of\r\nthe observed forces.\r\n\r\nThe current stations occupied cover a district embracing not only the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the shoals, but extending many miles from them in\r\ndifferent directions; for it was deemed necessary that each elementary\r\nforce should be separately studied before it reached its working point.\r\nIt has been ascertained that among the causes of the different shoal\r\nformations there exists a mutual relation and dependence, so that they\r\nmay be regarded as a single physical system. _It will be seen from this\r\nconsideration, that any artificial disturbance of the conditions, at a\r\nsingle point, may interrupt the operations of nature in other localities\r\nmore or less remote, or cause general changes in the hydrogaphy of the\r\nharbor._\r\n\r\nIt is not simply the superficial drift of the tidal and other currents\r\nthat these observations comprehend; but, with the use of apparatus\r\nsuitably arranged, the movements at all depths have been determined,\r\nwith the exact amount of power exerted by streams coursing along the bed\r\nof the sea. The necessity for this minuteness of examination has been\r\nfully shown in some of the curious discoveries that have been made.\r\n\r\nIn several parts of our harbor, systems of counter-currents have been\r\ndetected, occupying strata of water at different depths, and these\r\npresent, in their motions, striking contrasts of directions, velocities,\r\nand epochs. The most remarkable exhibition of these sub-currents was\r\nobserved in the neighborhood of the city, in the channel between\r\nGovernor's and Bedloe's Islands. In this locality, during the last\r\nquarter of the ebb, floating objects drift southward toward the sea,\r\nwhile the heavier material upon the bottom is borne northward toward the\r\ncity piers. While, upon the surface, the ebb exceeds the flood both in\r\nvelocity and duration, the motions of the lowest water-stratum are\r\nsubject to the reverse conditions: it therefore follows that _the\r\nheavier deposits from the city drainage cannot be swept away through\r\nthis the main avenue to the sea_. This contrast of motion between the\r\nupper and lower drifts was observed in greater or less degree throughout\r\nthe entire distance from the Bar to a point in the Hudson River off Fort\r\nWashington. These results appear to us of the highest importance, since\r\nthey would seem to indicate that the scouring action of the currents\r\nwill not be sufficient to prevent the accumulation of certain classes of\r\ndeposits in the upper harbor--as the ashes from the steamers, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nThe course of the land waters in their progress seaward was followed\r\nnearly sixty miles beyond the Bar, where currents of considerable\r\nvelocity were still observed. At the station farthest seaward, where the\r\nsounding is thirty fathoms, the observations at different depths\r\ndisclosed some very remarkable peculiarities. It was perceived that the\r\nmoving stratum was not always of the same depth; the whole body of the\r\nsea moving steadily forward at one time, while at another no motion\r\ncould be detected below a superficial stream.\r\n\r\nThe land waters, to which allusion has been made, augment the ebb\r\ncurrent to such a degree, that a general eastwardly preponderance was\r\nobserved in the drift along the south shore of Long Island; and this\r\npreponderance, increasing steadily from station to station at each\r\nremove, was found, at a point twenty-five miles east of Fire Island\r\nLight, to outlive the tidal currents and maintain itself as a constant\r\ncoastwise stream.\r\n\r\nOne very curious discovery was made with regard to this stream along\r\nshore. It was ascertained that during easterly gales a portion of the\r\nwater, crowded up into the bight of the coast, escapes seaward by a\r\nsub-current. Shells, carefully marked, were deposited in the sea during\r\nfine weather, and, after an easterly gale, were picked up on the shore\r\nof Fire Island, _four miles eastward_ of the place of deposit. There was\r\nno evidence that these shells travelled any distance during still\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nWe do not despair of the possibility of artificial improvements at the\r\nLong Island inlets.\r\n\r\nAt present the great inland basins on the southern portion of Long\r\nIsland communicate with the sea only by narrow passes obstructed by bars\r\nand shoals; yet, in spite of the dangers which are always presented,\r\nlarge fleets of market vessels pass out daily through the inlets, laden\r\nwith farm produce and shell fish. It requires no thought to perceive\r\nthat if these inlets were made safe and permanent by suitable marine\r\nconstructions, and were furnished with the proper buoys and beacons,\r\nthere would spring up in their neighborhood great commercial\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nWhile, in the case of the lower harbor and its approaches, it was the\r\ndesign of the observations to detect in the movement of the waters the\r\ncauses of alterations in the physical geography, the same kind of\r\nstudies, undertaken afterward in Hell Gate, had for their object the\r\nreverse inquiry, viz., to ascertain to what degree and in what manner\r\nthe form of the rocky channel influenced the tides and currents, in\r\norder that some prediction might be made of the consequences likely to\r\nfollow the removal of obstructions from the waterways. The propagations\r\nof the tide wave meet at Hell Gate, so that here the observations, when\r\nplotted, exhibit compound curves, in which the portion due to the wave\r\nfrom Sandy Hook is easily distinguishable from that due to the wave from\r\nLong Island Sound. The Sandy Hook tide wave differs so widely in height\r\nand time from that of Long Island Sound, that there is over three feet\r\ndifference of level between the harbor and the Sound at certain stages\r\nof the tides; and at these times the currents rush through the Gate,\r\nvainly endeavoring to restore the inequalities.\r\n\r\nThe problem of referring a current to a _tidal head_ is a very difficult\r\none. The current, for instance, which renders Hell Gate so dangerous, is\r\nnot at any time so great as a _permanent head_, equal to the difference\r\nof the tides observed, would engender. The currents are so very slow in\r\ntheir movements, compared with the undulations of the tide wave, that it\r\ncannot be ascertained as yet, what are the magnitudes of such elements\r\nas _inertia_ and _friction_, and how they are to be corrected for, so as\r\nto predict the time and velocity of the current from observations of the\r\nvertical rise and fall.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the officers of the Coast Survey to state that their\r\nservices to the Harbor Commissioners were rendered gratuitously; the\r\nwork offered to them only an opportunity for research.\r\n\r\nThis Physical Survey must, at the outset, have held out small\r\ninducements to patient labor--the field was so large and ill defined,\r\nand had been so long the region of mere speculation; but the few simple\r\nand useful generalizations it has now grasped should, hereafter, prove\r\nthe stepping stones to larger inductions, valuable alike to physical\r\nscience and commercial interests.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Report of the Observations for the Completion of the Physical Survey\r\nof New York Bar and Harbor, in pursuance of the Act of the Legislature\r\nof New York, April 17, 1857, and of the authority of the Commissioners\r\non Harbor Encroachments. By A. D. BACHE, Supt. U.S. Coast Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENGLISHMAN IN SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1860, AND JULY, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n'Mornin', sa! De Cunnel send dis with his compliments. Merry Christmas,\r\nsa!' Such was the salutation arousing me on the anniversary of the birth\r\nof Him who came on earth to preach the Gospel of love and fraternity to\r\nall men--or the date which pious tradition has arbitrarily assigned to\r\nit. And Pomp appeared by the bedside of the ponderous, old-fashioned\r\nfour-poster, in which I had slept, bearing a tumbler containing that\r\nvery favorite Southern 'eye-opener,' a mixture of peach brandy and\r\nhoney. I sipped, rose, and began dressing. The slave regarded me\r\nwistfully, and repeated his Christmas salutation.\r\n\r\nI knew what the poor fellow meant, well enough, and responded with a\r\ngratuity sufficient to make his black face lustrous with pleasure. All\r\nthrough the South the system of _backsheesh_ is as prevalent as in\r\nTurkey, and with more justification. At the hotels its adoption is\r\ncompulsory, if the traveller would shun eyeservice and the most\r\nprovoking inattention or neglect. His coffee appears unaccompanied by\r\nmilk or sugar, his steak without bread, condiments are inaccessible, and\r\nhis sable attendant does the least possible toward deserving that name,\r\nuntil a semi-weekly quarter or half dollar transforms him from a miracle\r\nof stupidity and awkwardness into your enthusiastic and ever-zealous\r\nretainer. This, however, by the way.\r\n\r\nMy present had the usual effect; Pompey became approbative and\r\ntalkative:\r\n\r\n'You come from England, sa?' he asked, looking up from the hearth and\r\ntemporarily desisting in his vigorous puffing at the fire he had already\r\nkindled for me to dress by.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I answered.\r\n\r\n'Dat a long ways off, sa?'\r\n\r\n'Over three thousand miles of salt water, Pompey.'\r\n\r\n'Golly! I 'fraid o' dem! didn't tink dere was so much water in de\r\nworld!' adding a compliment on the supposed courage involved in crossing\r\nthe Atlantic. Negroes have almost no relative ideas of distance or\r\nnumber beyond a very limited extent; they will say 'a tousan'd,' fifty\r\nor a hundred 'tousand,' with equal inexactitude and fluency. Presently\r\nPompey began again:\r\n\r\n'Many colored people in England, sa?'\r\n\r\n'Very few. You might live there a year without meeting one.'\r\n\r\n'I'se hear dey's all free--dem what is dar? dat so?' he asked,\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n'Yes; just as they are at the North; only I think they're a little\r\nbetter treated in England. We don't make any difference between men on\r\naccount of their skin. You might marry a white woman there, Pompey, if\r\nyou could get her to have you.'\r\n\r\nPompey honored this remark with as much ready negro laughter as he\r\nseemed to think it demanded.\r\n\r\n'I'se got a wife already, sa,' he answered. 'But 'pears to me England\r\nmust be good country to lib in.'\r\n\r\n'Why so?'\r\n\r\n'All free dar, sa!'\r\n\r\n'Why you'd have to work harder than you do here, and have nobody to take\r\ncare of you. The climate wouldn't suit you, either, there's not enough\r\nsunshine. You couldn't have a kinder or a better master than Colonel\r\n----, I'm sure.'\r\n\r\n'No, _sa!_' with a good deal of earnestness; 'he fust-rate man, sa, dat\r\na fac; and Mass' Philip and de young ladies, dey berry good to us.\r\nBut--' and the slave hesitated.\r\n\r\n'What is it, Pompey? Speak out!'\r\n\r\n'Well, den, some day de Cunnel he die, and den trouble come, _suah!_ De\r\nole plantation be sold, and de hands sold too, or we be divide 'tween\r\nMass' Phil, Miss Jule, and Miss Emmy. Dey get married, ob course. Some\r\ngo one way, some toder, we wid dem--nebber lib together no more. Dat's\r\nwhat I keep t'inkin ob, sa!'\r\n\r\nWhat answer could be made to this simple statement of one of the dire\r\ncontingencies inevitable to slave life? perhaps that most dreaded by the\r\nlimited class of well cared-for house servants, of which Pompey was a\r\ngood representative. He knew, as well as I, that his poor average of\r\nhappiness was fortuitous--that it hinged on the life of his master. At\r\nhis death he might become the chattel of any human brute with a white\r\nepidermis and money enough to buy him; might be separated from wife,\r\nchildren, companions and past associations. Suggesting the practical\r\nwisdom involved in the biblical axiom that sufficient for the day is the\r\nevil thereof, I turned the conversation and presently dismissed him. I\r\nexperienced some little difficulty in accomplishing the latter, for he\r\nwas both zealous and familiar in my service: indeed, this is one of the\r\nnuisances appertaining to the institution; a pet slave seems hardly to\r\nunderstand the desire for privacy, and is prone to consider himself\r\nill-used if you presume to dispense with his attendance. His ideal of a\r\nmaster is one who needs a great deal of waiting on in trivial,\r\nunlaborious ways, who tolerates all shortcomings and slovenliness, and\r\nbestows liberal gratuities.\r\n\r\nDescending to the breakfast parlor, I received and responded to the\r\nappropriate salutations for the day from my host and his family, who had\r\nalready recognized it, English fashion, by the interchange of mutual\r\npresents, those of the Colonel to his daughters being jewelry of a\r\nhandsome and expensive character. The trinkets were submitted to my\r\ninspection and duly admired.\r\n\r\n'I must tell you something about these knick-knacks, Mr. ----,' said the\r\nevidently gratified father. 'You wouldn't suppose, now, that these\r\nmercenary girls actually asked me to give them money instead of\r\ntrinkets?'\r\n\r\nHis tone and looks involved some latent compliment to the young ladies,\r\nand I said as much.\r\n\r\n'They wanted to give it to the State, to help arm and equip some of the\r\nmilitary companies. I couldn't let 'em suffer for their patriotism, you\r\nknow; so I had to advance the money and buy the trinkets, too; though\r\nI'll do them the justice to say they didn't expect it. Never mind! the\r\nSouthern Confederacy and free trade will reimburse me. And now let's\r\nhave breakfast.'\r\n\r\nThe Southern Confederacy and Free Trade! During secession time in\r\nCharleston, there was displayed in front of the closed theatre, a\r\nfoolish daub on canvas, depicting crowded wharves, cotton bales,\r\narriving and departing vessels, and other indications of maritime and\r\ncommercial prosperity, surmounted by seven stars, that being the\r\nexpected number of seceding States, all presented as a representation of\r\nthe good time coming. It remained there for over a month, when one of\r\nthose violent storms of wind and rain variegating the humidity of a\r\nSouth-Carolinian winter tore it to pieces, leaving only the skeleton\r\nframework on which it had been supported. May not this picture and its\r\nend prove symbolical?\r\n\r\n'Did you observe that our Charleston ladies dress very plainly, this\r\nseason?' continued the Colonel, as we sat at breakfast. 'There are no\r\nsilks and satins this Christmas, no balls, no concerts, no marriages. We\r\nare generally economizing for whatever may happen.'\r\n\r\n'Why, I thought you didn't expect war?' I answered.\r\n\r\n'No more we do; but it's well to be prepared.'\r\n\r\n'There's to be no race ball, I understand,' said the lazy gentleman, who\r\nhad appeared later than the rest of us, and was having a couple of eggs\r\n'opened' for him into a tumbler, by Pompey. 'The girls will miss that.\r\nCan you tell me how the betting stood between _Albine_ and _Planet_?'\r\n\r\nI could not, and observed that the Colonel changed the subject with some\r\nmarks of irritation. I learned afterward that his indolent relative had\r\nan incurable passion for betting, and, when carried away by it, was\r\ncapable of giving unauthorized notes upon his opulent relative, who paid\r\nthem in honor of the family name, but objected to the practice. He\r\nhimself affected to discourage betting, though his State pride actually\r\ninduced him to risk money on the 'little mare' _Albine_, a\r\nSouth-Carolina horse, who subsequently and very unexpectedly triumphed\r\nover her Virginian opponent. But this by the way.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over and cigars lighted (the Colonel imported his own from\r\nHavana, each one enwrapped in a separate leaf, and especially excellent\r\nin quality), we strolled abroad. The negroes were not at work, of\r\ncourse; and, early as it was, we found their quarters all alive with\r\nmerriment and expectation. Some of the younger men, dressed in their\r\nbest clothes--generally suits of plain, substantial homespun, white or\r\ncheck shirts, and felt hats--went from house to house, wishing the\r\ninmates the compliments of the season, blended with obstreperous,\r\nbroad-mouthed laughter; in some instances carrying nosegays, received,\r\nin common with the givers, with immense delight and coquetry on the part\r\nof the females. These wore neatly-made, clean cotton dresses, with\r\ngaily-colored handkerchiefs arranged turban fashion upon their heads.\r\nMany of the old men and not a few of the old women were smoking clay or\r\ncorncob pipes; the children laughed, cried, played with each other,\r\nrolled upon the ground, and disported themselves as children, white,\r\nblack, or particolored, do all the world over; the occasional twang of a\r\nbanjo and a fiddle was heard, and everything looked like enjoyment and\r\nanticipation. Of course, the huts of the future brides constituted the\r\ncentre of attraction: from the chattering of tongues within we inferred\r\nthat the wedding dresses were exposed for the admiring inspection of the\r\nnegro population.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel had just arrived at the peroration of an eloquent eulogium\r\nof the scene, when the overseer appeared at the end of the avenue of\r\norange trees, and presently drew rein beside us, his countenance\r\nexhibiting marks of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n'I've had trouble with them boys over to my place, Colonel,' he said,\r\nbriefly, and looking loweringly around, as though he would be disposed\r\nto resent any listening to his report on the part of the negroes.\r\n\r\n'Why, what's the matter with them?' asked his employer, hastily.\r\n\r\n'Well, it 'pears they got some rotgut--two gallon of it--from somewheres\r\nlast night, and of course, all got as drunk as h----, down to the old\r\nshanty behind the gin--they went thar so's I shouldn't suspicion\r\nnothin'. They played cards, and quarrelled and fit, and Hurry's John he\r\ncut Timberlake bad--cut Wilkie, too, 'cross the hand, but ain't hurt him\r\nmuch!'\r\n\r\n'Hurry's John! I always knew that nigger had a d----d ugly temper!' I'll\r\nsell him, by ---- ! I won't have him on the place a week longer. Is\r\nTimberlake badly hurt?'\r\n\r\n'He's nigh killed, I reckon. Got a bad stick in the ribs, and a cut in\r\nthe shoulder, and one in the face--bled like a hog, he did! Reckon he\r\nmay get over it. I've done what I could for him.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel's handsome face was inflamed with passion; he strode up and\r\ndown, venting imprecations of an intensity only to be achieved by an\r\nenraged Southerner. Presently he stopped and asked abruptly:\r\n\r\n'Where did they get the liquor from?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. Most likely from old Whalley, down to the landing. He's\r\nmean enough for anything.'\r\n\r\n'If I can prove it on him, I'll run him out of the country!\r\nI'll--I'll--d----n it! I'll shoot him!' And the Colonel continued his\r\nimprecations, this time directing them toward the supposed vender of the\r\nwhiskey.\r\n\r\n'These men are the curse of the country! the curse of the country!' he\r\nrepeated, excitedly; 'these d----d mean, low, thieving, sneaking,\r\npilfering, poor whites! They teach our negroes to steal, they sell them\r\nliquor, they do everything to corrupt and demoralize them. That's how\r\nthey _live_, by ----! The slaves are respectable, compared to them. By\r\n----, they ought to be slaves themselves--only no amount of paddling[10]\r\nwould get any work out of their d----d lazy hides! I almost wish we\r\nmight have a war with the Yankees: we should get some of 'em killed off,\r\nthen!'\r\n\r\nHow little Colonel ---- thought, as he uttered these words, 'so wicked\r\nand uncivic' (as Gellius says of a similar wish on the part of a Roman\r\nlady, for which she was fined the sum of twenty-five thousand pounds\r\nbrass), that in the future lay such dire fulfilment of them! Apropos of\r\nthe subject, what fitting tools for the purposes of rebellion have these\r\nhated 'poor whites' proved themselves!--their ignorance, their vices,\r\ntheir brutality rendering them all the more appropriate instruments for\r\nthe work in hand. It would seem, almost, as if a diabolic providence had\r\nprepared them for this very result.\r\n\r\n'I must ride over and see about this business at once,' resumed the\r\nColonel. 'Mr. ----, I can very well suppose you'd rather be spared\r\naccompanying me, so make yourself at home for an hour or two. I won't be\r\na minute longer than I can help. Perhaps you'd better not mention this\r\nunfortunate affair up at the house until I return; it'll shock the\r\ngirls, and I'm very careful to keep all unpleasant things out of their\r\nway. It's the first time such an atrocity has occurred on this\r\nplantation, believe me.'\r\n\r\nAnd, ordering his horse, he rode off with the overseer. I should really\r\nhave preferred visiting the scene of the recent tragedy, but my host's\r\nwish to the contrary was evident, and I knew enough of Southern\r\nsensitiveness with respect to the ugly side of their 'institution' to\r\ncomply. (I had been advised by a fellow countryman not to attend a slave\r\nsale in Charleston, lest my curiosity might be looked upon as\r\nimpertinent, and get me into trouble; but I did it, and, I am bound to\r\nsay, without any evil consequences.) So I retraced my steps toward the\r\nhouse, presently encountering the lazy gentleman, and one in black, who\r\nwas introduced to me as the Reverend Mr. ----, an Episcopal clergyman of\r\nBeaufort, also a resident on an adjacent island.\r\n\r\nThe lazy gentleman inquired after Colonel ----. Judging that my host's\r\ncaution, as to secrecy, was only intended to apply to his daughters, I\r\nmade no scruple of relating what I had heard. My auditors were at once\r\nmore than interested--anxious. Whenever a negro breaks bounds in the\r\nSouth, everybody is on the alert, a self-constituted detective, judge,\r\ninquisitor, and possible executioner. Eternal vigilance is the price\r\nof--slavery!\r\n\r\n'That boy born on the plantation?' asked the clergyman, when the affair\r\nhad been discussed at considerable length.\r\n\r\n'Yes! He's a valuable hand, too; I've known him pick seven hundred and\r\nfifty pounds of cotton in a day--of course, for a wager.'\r\n\r\n'The Colonel will have to sell him, I suppose? he can't keep him after\r\nthis.'\r\n\r\n'Reckon so, though he hates to part with any of his hands. This trouble\r\nwouldn't have happened, if it hadn't been for the whiskey, I've no\r\ndoubt. The rascal who sold it ought to be responsible.'\r\n\r\n'Are crimes originating in drunkenness common among the negroes?' I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n'Well, no!' answered the clergyman, deliberately; 'I can't say that. But\r\nmost of them will drink, if they get an opportunity--the field hands\r\nespecially; and then they're apt to be quarrelsome, and if there's a\r\nknife handy, they'll use it.'\r\n\r\n'That's so,' assented the lazy gentleman, nodding. 'You Englishmen and\r\nYankees--excuse me for coupling you together!--know very little of negro\r\ncharacter; and, because the darkies have a habit of indulging in\r\nunmeaning laughter on all occasions, you think them the best-tempered\r\npeople in existence. In reality their tempers are often\r\nexecrable--infernal!' And he compacently blew a ring of tobacco-smoke\r\ninto the mild, humid morning. The clergyman looked on assentingly.\r\n\r\n'They can never be trusted with any responsibility involving the\r\nexercise of authority without abusing it. They ill use animals on all\r\noccasions--treat them with positive brutality, and sometimes whip their\r\nchildren so unmercifully that we have to interfere. I don't know what\r\nwould become of them without us, I'm sure!'\r\n\r\n'What do you think of their religious convictions?' I asked of the\r\nclergyman, when the speaker had arrived at his comfortable,\r\ncharacteristically Southern conclusion.\r\n\r\n'Our best negroes are unquestionably pious,' he answered; 'and some of\r\nthem have a very earnest sense of their duties as to this life and the\r\nnext; but I regret to say that a good deal of what passes for religion\r\namong them is mere exitement, often of a mischievous and sensual\r\ncharacter.'\r\n\r\n'Heathenish! quite heathenish!' added the lazy gentleman. 'Did you ever\r\nsee a _shout_, Mr. ----?'\r\n\r\nI responded in the negative, and inquired what it was.\r\n\r\n'Oh, a dance of negro men and women to the accompaniment of their own\r\nvoices. It's of no particular figure, and they sing to no particular\r\ntune, improvising both at pleasure, and keeping it up for an hour\r\ntogether. I'll defy you to look at it without thinking of Ashantee or\r\nDahomey; it's so suggestive of aboriginal Africa.'\r\n\r\nI had an opportunity, subsequently, of witnessing the performance in\r\nquestion, and can indorse the lazy gentleman's assertion. Inheriting the\r\nsaltatory traditions of their barbarous ancestry, the slaves have also a\r\ncurrent fund of superstition, of a simple and curious character. But\r\nfurther ethical disquisitions were here cut short by the appearance of\r\nthe Colonel's daughters, when the conversation was at once changed, as\r\nby tacit consent of all three of us. What their father had told me,\r\nrelative to his solicitude to keep them in ignorance of all 'unpleasant\r\nthings' accruing from the fundamental institution, was in perfect\r\naccordance with Southern instincts. I had observed similar instances of\r\nhabitual caution before, reminding me of the eulogized tendency toward\r\n'Orientalism' alluded to in the previous chapter. And, of all people,\r\nSouth-Carolinians possess the equally rare and admirable faculty of\r\nholding their tongues, when there is occasion for it.\r\n\r\nWe joined the ladies in a walk. As the elder had much to say to the\r\nclergyman about mutual acquaintances, while her fat relative strolled\r\ncarelessly by her side, her sister naturally fell to my companionship.\r\nWith a rather handsome and intelligent girl I should have preferred to\r\nconverse on general topics than the one with which I had been already\r\nnauseated at Charleston--secession; but she was full of it, and would\r\nnot be evaded. Very soon she asked me what I supposed would be the\r\nsentiment in England toward the seceding States, in the assumed event of\r\ntheir forming a confederacy.\r\n\r\nI told her, as I then believed, that it would be adverse, in consequence\r\nof the national hostility to slavery, appealing to her own British\r\nexperience for confirmation.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she said, 'they were all abolitionists in England, and could\r\nhardly credit us when we told them that _we_ owned negroes. They thought\r\nall Southerners must be like Legree in _Uncle Tom's Cabin_! But papa,\r\nwho went to the club houses, and mixed with the aristocracy, says that\r\n_they_ are much better informed about us; that they were opposed to\r\nemancipation in the West Indies, and have always regarded it as a great\r\nmistake. And England must have cotton, you know.'\r\n\r\n'If there's a war between the North and South, won't you find it very\r\ndifficult to retain your negroes?' I asked, waiving the immediate\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nMiss ---- responded by the usual assertion of the fidelity of the slaves\r\nto their owners.\r\n\r\n'What if the new Government resorts to emancipation as a weapon against\r\nyou?' I made this inquiry, thinking it possible that this might be done\r\n_at the outset_. Like other foreigners, though familiar with the North,\r\nI had not supposed that nearly two years of civil war, with its\r\ninevitable expenditure of blood and treasure, would be needed to induce\r\nthis direct and obvious means of subduing a rebellion. Englishmen, it is\r\nknown, have ferocious ideas on the subject, as witness India.\r\n\r\n'If the slaves rose, we should kill them like so many snakes!' was the\r\nanswer. And the young lady's voice and flashing eyes showed that she was\r\nin earnest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur promenade lasted until the return of the Colonel, who presently took\r\na private opportunity of informing me that the wounded slave would\r\nprobably survive, and that he had sent for a surgeon from an adjoining\r\nplantation, expressing some apprehension that delay or indifference on\r\nhis part might involve fatal consequences.\r\n\r\n'It's Christmas time, you see, and perhaps he won't care about coming,'\r\nsaid my host. I may add that his anticipation was in part verified by\r\nthe result, 'the doctor' not appearing till the following morning.\r\nThanks, however, to a rough knowledge of surgery on the part of the\r\noverseer, aided by the excellence of his constitution, 'Timberlake'\r\nrecovered. I will mention here, in dismissing the subject, that 'Hurry's\r\nJohn' was subsequently sold to a Louisiana sugar-planter, a fate only\r\nless terrible to a negro than his exportation to Texas.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of our return to the house, we partook of an excellent\r\nand luxurious Christmas dinner, to which birds of the air, beasts of the\r\nearth, and fish of the sea had afforded tribute, and the best of\r\nEuropean wines served as an appropriate accompaniment. The meal was, I\r\nthink, served earlier than usual, that we might attend the event of the\r\nday, the negro weddings.\r\n\r\nThese were solemnized at a little private church, in the rear of which\r\nwas absolutely the most enormous live-oak I had ever seen, its branches,\r\nfringed with pendent moss, literally covering the small churchyard,\r\nwhere, perhaps, a dozen of the ---- family lie buried--a few tombstones,\r\nhalf hidden by the refuse of the luxuriant vegetation, marking their\r\nplaces of sepulture. The plain interior of the building had been\r\ndecorated with evergreens in honor of the time and the occasion, under\r\nthe tasteful direction of the young ladies, who had also contrived to\r\nfurnish white dresses and bouquets for the brides. These, duly escorted\r\nby their future husbands, clad in their best, and looking alternate\r\nhappiness and sheepishness, had preceded us by a few minutes, and were\r\nwaiting our arrival, while all around beamed black faces full of\r\nexpectation and interest.\r\n\r\nWe walked through a lane of sable humanity--for the church was too small\r\nto contain a fourth of the assembled negroes--to the little altar,\r\nbefore which the six couples were presently posed by the clergyman, in\r\nfront of us and himself. That done to everybody's satisfaction, the\r\nColonel stationed to give away the brides--an arrangement that caused a\r\nvisible flutter of delight among them--and as many lookers-on\r\naccommodated within the building as could crowd in, the ceremony was\r\nproceeded with, the clergyman using an abbreviated form of the Episcopal\r\nservice, reading it but once, but demanding separate responses. I\r\nnoticed that he omitted the words 'until death do ye part,' and I\r\nthought that omission suggestive.\r\n\r\nThe persons directly concerned behaved with as much propriety as if they\r\nhad possessed the whitest of cuticles, being quiet, serious, and\r\nattentive; nor did I detect anything indecorous on the part of the\r\nspectators, beyond an occasional smile or whisper by the younger\r\nnegroes, whose soft-skinned, dusky faces and white eyeballs glanced\r\nupward at the six couples with admiring curiosity, and at us, visitors,\r\nwith that appealing glance peculiar to the negro--always, to my\r\nthinking, irresistibly touching, and suggestive of dependence on,\r\nhumility toward, and entreaty for merciful consideration at the hands of\r\na superior race. Perhaps, however, the old folks enjoyed the occasion\r\nmost, particularly the negresses: one wrinkled crone, of at least\r\nfourscore years, her head bound in, the usual gaudy handkerchief, and\r\nher hands resting on a staff or crutch, went off into a downright\r\nchuckle of irrepressible exultation after the closing benediction,\r\nechoed more openly by the crowd of colored people peeping in at the\r\ndoors and windows.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony over, the concourse adjourned to a large frame building,\r\npart shed, part cotton-house, ordinarily used for storing the staple\r\nplant of South Carolina, before ginning and pressing. The Colonel had\r\nsent his year's crop to Charleston, and the vacant space was now\r\noccupied by a triple row of tables, set out with plates, knives and\r\nforks, and drinking utensils. Here, the newly married couples being\r\ninducted into the uppermost seats, as places of honor, and the rest of\r\nthe company accommodated as well as could be effected, a substantial\r\ndinner was served, and partaken of with a gusto and appreciation only\r\nconceivable in those to whom such an indulgence is exceptional, coming,\r\nlike the occasion, but once in a year. Upward of a hundred and fifty\r\npersons sat down to it, exclusive of those temporarily detailed as\r\nwaiters, who presently found leisure to minister to their own appetites.\r\nTheir owner surveyed the scene with an air of gratification, in which I\r\ncould not detect a trace of his recent serious discomposure. I am well\r\npersuaded, however, that he had not forgotten it, as that the cause of\r\nit was known among the negroes; I thought I observed evidences of it in\r\ntheir looks and deportment, even amid the general hilarity.\r\n\r\nThe ladies had returned to the house, and we were about following them,\r\nwhen the clatter of a horse's hoofs was heard without, and the officious\r\nvoices of the negroes announced the arrival of a visitor or messenger\r\nfor the Colonel, who stepped forward to meet him. A young man, clad in a\r\ncoarse homespun gray uniform, scantily trimmed with red worsted, and a\r\nFrench military cap, alighted, and addressed our friend in a faltering,\r\nhesitating manner, as though communicating some disastrous intelligence.\r\nI saw the Colonel turn pale, and put his hand to his head as if he had\r\nreceived a stunning blow. Instinctively the three of us rushed toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'My God! what's the matter? what has happened, ----?' inquired the\r\nclergyman.\r\n\r\n'Philip! Philip! my boy's dead--shot himself by accident!' was the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nA very few words explained all, The young volunteer had fallen a victim\r\nto one of those common instances of carelessness in playing with loaded\r\nfirearms. While frolicking with a comrade, at his barracks, he had taken\r\nup his revolver, jestingly threatening to shoot. The other, grasping the\r\nbarrel of the cocked pistol, in turning it round, had caused its\r\ndischarge, the bullet penetrating the breast of the unfortunate owner of\r\nthe weapon. Conveyed to the hospital, he had died within an hour after\r\nhis arrival.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur holiday-making, of course, came to a sudden termination. Next day I\r\naccompanied the Colonel to Charleston, to claim the body of his deceased\r\nson, and not long afterward parted with him, on my return to the North.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] The paddle has superseded the cowhide in all jails, workhouses, and\r\nplaces of punishment in South Carolina, as being more effective--that is\r\npainful. In some instances it is used on the plantations. It consists of\r\na wooden instrument, shaped like a baker's peel, with a blade from three\r\nto five inches wide, and from eight to ten long. There are commonly\r\nholes in the blade, which give the application a percussive effect. In\r\nCharleston this punishment is generally administered at the guardhouse\r\nby the police, who are all Irishmen. Any offended master or mistress\r\nsends a slave to the place of chastisement with a note, stating the\r\ndesired amount, which is duly honored. Like institutions breed like\r\nresults all over the world: in Sala's 'Journey Due North' we find the\r\nsame system in operation in Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEN, PALLET, AND PIANO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the roar of cannon and tramp of armed men resounding through the\r\nland, and the fair young face of the Republic disfigured to our eyes by\r\nthe deep furrows of war, it is pleasant to know that in certain nooks\r\nand corners, gentler sounds of harmony still linger, and that ateliers\r\nexist where men's fancies grow on canvas from day to day into soothing\r\nvisions of loveliness.\r\n\r\nThe scarlet-and-gold and general paraphernalia of war are too tempting\r\nto pallet and brush, not to be seized on with avidity and reproduced\r\nwith marvellous truth; but it is more agreeable to pass over accurate\r\nrepresentations of the Irish zouave, with Celtic features, not purely\r\nclassical in outline, glowing defiantly under the red cap of the Arab,\r\nand Teutonic cavalrymen, clinging clumsily to their steeds, and turn for\r\nsolace to the grand, solemn Shores of Niagara, to wander amid the\r\ntangled luxuriance of the Heart of the Andes, or to bask in the sweet\r\nsilence of Twilight in the Wilderness. There are Icebergs too, floating\r\nin the Arctic Sea, frozen white and mute with horror at the dread\r\nsecrets of ages; but, responsive to the versatile talent of the hand\r\nthat creates them, they glow with prismatic light of many colors. Mr.\r\nChurch irradiates the frozen regions with the coruscations of his own\r\ngenius, bringing to these lonely, despairing masses of ice the\r\nrevivifying hope and promise of warmer climates.\r\n\r\nIn pondering over the sad mystery of these Icebergs, we float down again\r\nto Tropical Seas and Islands; and as we linger under the shade of palm\r\nand banana tree, the rude chant of the negro strikes the ear in the\r\ngrotesque and characteristic framework of the '_Bananier_,' the\r\nplaintive melody of '_La Savane_' sighs past on the evening breeze,\r\nSpanish eyes flash out temptingly from the enticing cadence of the\r\n'_Ojos Criollos_,' and Spanish guitars tinkle in the soft moonlight of\r\nthe '_Minuit a Seville,_' and Tropical life awakes to melody under the\r\ntouch of the Creole poet of the piano, Mr. Gottschalk.\r\n\r\nThere are many beings, otherwise estimable, to whom the Tropical sense\r\nis wanting; who are ever suspicious of malaria lurking under the rich,\r\nglossy leaves of the orange groves; who look with disgust and loathing\r\nat the exaggerated proportions and venomous nature of all creeping\r\nthings; who find the succulence of the fruit unpleasant to the taste,\r\nand the flowers, though fair to the eye, deadly as the upas tree to all\r\nother sense;--for whom it is no compensation to feel, with the first\r\nbreath of morning air, the dull, leaden weight of life lifted, or no\r\nhappiness to watch the sea heaving and palpitating with delight under\r\nthe rays of the noon-day sun, and to know that the stars at night droop\r\ndown lovingly and confidingly to the embrace of warm Tropical earth.\r\nWith an insensibility to these influences, there can be but little\r\nsympathy or appreciation of the works of Mr. Gottschalk; for all that is\r\nborn of the Tropics partakes of its beauties and its defects, its\r\npassionate languor, its useless profusion and its poetic tenderness. And\r\nwhere else in the United States, can we look for a spontaneous gush of\r\nmelody? Plymouth Rock and its surroundings have not hitherto seemed\r\nfavorable to the growth and manifestation of musical genius; for the old\r\nPuritan element, in its savage intent to annihilate the aesthetic part of\r\nman's nature, under the deadening dominion of its own Blue Laws, and to\r\ncrush out whatever of noble inspiration had been vouchsafed to man by\r\nhis Creator, rarely sought relief in outbursts of song.\r\n\r\nPsalmody appears to have been the chief source of musical indulgence,\r\nand for many a long, weary year, hymns of praise, nasal in tone and\r\ndismal in tendency, have ascended from our prim forefathers to the\r\nthrone of grace on high.\r\n\r\nSuch depressing musical antecedents have not prepared New England for\r\ngreater efforts of melody than are to be found in the simple ballads\r\nsupposed to originate with the plantation negro, who, in addition to his\r\nother burdens, is thus chosen to assume the onerous one of Northern\r\nsong, as being the only creature frivolous enough to indulge in vain\r\ncarolling. If we can scarcely affirm that the Americans are yet a\r\nmusical people, that they would be is an undeniable fact, and one\r\nconstantly evinced in their lavish support of artists, from the highest\r\nto the lowest grade. Among the musical aspirants to popular favor, none\r\nhas of late enjoyed so large a share of notice and admiration as Mr.\r\nGottschalk; and to return from our recent digression, we will proceed to\r\nthe consideration of his compositions. Fragmentary and suggestive as are\r\nhis ideas, there is infinite method and system in their treatment.\r\nAvoiding thus far what is termed '_sustained effort_,' and which\r\nfrequently implies the same demands on the patience of the listener as\r\non the creative power of the composer, Mr. Gottschalk's compositions\r\ncontain just so much of the true poetic vein as can be successfully\r\ndigested and enjoyed in a piano piece of moderate length. With the power\r\nto conceive, and the will and discipline of mind to execute, there is no\r\nreason why, with perhaps a diminished tendency to fritter away positive\r\nexcellence at the shrine of effect, enduring proofs of the genius of our\r\nAmerican pianist should not be given to the world.\r\n\r\nAs a mere player, the popularity of Mr. Gottschalk with the uninitiated\r\nmasses is due, in a great measure, to his tact in discerning the\r\nAmerican craving for novelty and sensation, and to his native\r\noriginality and brilliancy, which allow him to respond so fully to these\r\nexigencies of public taste, as to possess on all occasions the keynote\r\nto applause. The faculty of never degenerating into dulness, the rock on\r\nwhich most pianists are wrecked in early youth, is another just cause\r\nfor insuring to our compatriot the preeminence which he enjoys. Viewed\r\nfrom a critical point, the mechanical endowments and acquirements of\r\nGottschalk are such as to enable him to subject his playing to the test\r\nof keenest analysis without detriment to his reputation. For clearness\r\nand limpidity of touch and unerring precision, for impetuosity of style,\r\ncombined with dreamy delicacy, he has few rivals. The evenness and\r\nbrilliancy of his trill are unequalled, the mechanical process required\r\nto produce it being lost to sight in the wonderful birdlike nature of\r\nthe effect. In the playing of classical music, Mr. Gottschalk has to\r\ncontend against his own individuality. This individuality, naturally\r\nintense and of a kind calculated to meet with public favor, has been\r\ncultivated and indulged in to such an extent as to prove an occasional\r\nobstacle to the exclusive absorption and utter identification with the\r\nideas of another composer that classical music demands. In the mere\r\nmatter of execution there is no difficulty which the fingers of this\r\nskilful pianist cannot overcome, and his intellectual grasp of a subject\r\nenables him to discern and interpret the beauties of all musical themes;\r\nbut where an earnest, passionate interest in the music of the old\r\nmasters is not felt by the performer, it is rarely communicated to his\r\nhearers.\r\n\r\nThe world of letters, however, has not seemingly regretted the inability\r\nof Byron to trammel his muse with the uncongenial fetters of Pope's\r\nmetre, and has certainly never quarrelled with Tom Moore for not\r\nassuming the manners and diction of the revered Samuel Johnson, LL.D.\r\n\r\nWith due allowance for difference of latitude, and wide difference of\r\naim and pursuit, the contemplation of the Master of Creole Melody\r\nrecalls to us a genius which found utterance in song none the less\r\nmelodious that it was written, not sung. The 'ashen sky' and 'crisped,\r\nsere leaves of the lonesome October,' so thrillingly pictured by Edgar\r\nPoe in his 'Ulalume,' find echo in the foreboding sadness of the opening\r\nbars to Gottschalk's 'Last Hope;' and as both poems grow in vague,\r\ndreamy sound, they culminate in a cry of smothered despair at the tomb\r\nwhere all hopes lie buried with the lost Ulalume. The same weird\r\nconception and eccentricity of design, with knowledge of rhythmical\r\neffect and extreme carefulness of finish, are prominent traits of both\r\nartists; and the American disregard of tradition, as evinced in all\r\nenterprises, whether literary, artistic, or commercial, and which\r\nreadily infects the simple sojourner among us as well as the happy being\r\nborn to republican privileges, marks alike the nationality of poet and\r\npianist.\r\n\r\nEdgar Poe's literary reputation undoubtedly gains additional lustre as\r\nthe lapse of years permits the veil of obscurity to fall over the\r\npersonal vices and irregularities which so tarnished the living fame of\r\nthis great artist. Genius draws around itself a magical circle,\r\nattracting and keeping by the force of its own magnetism those whom it\r\nvalues, but at the same time exercising an equally repellent effect on\r\nthe envious and ignorant wandering beyond the pale of its charmed\r\nprecincts. Hence the difficulty of judging it by contemporaneous\r\nstandards. The Hyperion head of Poe was lost to the view of many by a\r\ntoo persistent search for the satyr's cloven foot. In considering the\r\npoet's eccentricities, in common with other extraordinary and anomalous\r\nbeings, it must be deeply deplored that one so endowed with wealth of\r\nintellect beyond his fellow men, should be still so poor in moral store\r\nthat the dullest of them could dare look with disdain on this heir to\r\ngifts regal and sacred.\r\n\r\nHe could forget his deep, earnest love of order in things intellectual,\r\nin every excess of disorder in things material, and his passionate love\r\nof the beautiful could be profaned by frequent grovelling amid the\r\nhideous deformities of vice. Poe, in his reverence for Art (his only\r\nreverence), seemed generally to set greater store on the elaborate and\r\nartistic perfection of his works, than in the spontaneity of genius\r\ntherein displayed. So it would seem, at least, in his voluntarily\r\nexposing the skeleton design of his greatest poem, 'The Raven,' and the\r\nvarious processes by which this grand shadow attained its final\r\nharmonious and terrible proportions. This may be a noble sacrifice to\r\nthe principles of Art, intended as a warning to rash novices against the\r\nsin of slovenliness in composition; but the poem must be of solid fibre\r\nto resist this disenchanting test. The unveiling of hidden mysteries,\r\nthe disclosure of trap doors, ropes, and pulleys, may assist in the\r\ngeneral dissemination of knowledge; but in behalf of those who prefer to\r\nbe ignorant that they may be happy, we protest against the innovation.\r\nIn this dangerous experiment of Poe's, however, we are forced to do what\r\nhe would have us do--admire the ingenuity of the poet, together with his\r\nknowledge of effect, rhythmical and dramatic, his flexibility and\r\nstrength of versification, and marvellous faculty of word painting. This\r\npropensity to make all things subservient to the advancement of Art is\r\nnot always productive of present good to one's fellow beings, whatever\r\nmay be the results to posterity, as the luckless women who cross the\r\npath of such men cannot unfrequently testify--oftentimes assiduously\r\nwooed, won, and lightly discarded, to furnish an artistic study of the\r\nfemale capacity for suffering, as well as to supply renewed inspiration\r\nfor further poetic bemoanings. In the prose narrations of Edgar Poe, the\r\nsame skilful handling of mystery, and the turning to account of any\r\nincident susceptible of dramatic effect, are always apparent as in his\r\npoems. But the want of extended sympathy with mankind, the artist\r\negotism, which looks inwardly for all material, and in truth scorns the\r\napproval of the masses, must naturally fail to secure the interest of a\r\nlarge class of readers. His compositions, on the contrary, which give\r\nfull scope to his keen, subtle powers of analysis, and vigorous handling\r\nof the subject in question, are more widely understood and appreciated.\r\nSince the days when Poe dealt with contemporaneous literature, and\r\nliterary men, in not the most temperate mood of criticism, poetic fire\r\nin America, with few exceptions, seems to have sunk into a dead,\r\nsmouldering condition, and to have yielded to its sister art of painting\r\nthe task of grappling with the New-World monster of utilitarianism and\r\npractical reform. The demands for indigenous painters in America being\r\nconstantly greater, the result is necessarily a vast increase and\r\nimprovement in this branch of Art.\r\n\r\nNew England, on whose barren musical soil we have already descanted, and\r\nwho has not hitherto disputed to the Old World her privilege of pouring\r\nout on our untutored continent the accumulated wealth of years of\r\nmusical study and training, has at last gone far to redeem her\r\nreputation of artistic nullity, by producing the greatest landscape\r\npainter of which the country can boast. With us, the superiority of\r\natmospheric effects over most countries, and the great variety and\r\noriginality of American scenery, have united in bringing the landscape\r\npainter into existence, and the public have assured this existence by\r\nfostering applause and pecuniary compensation. Nature, thus prodigal of\r\ngifts to America, has, in a crowning act of munificence, conferred also\r\na painter, capable of interpreting her own most recondite mysteries, and\r\nof faithfully transcribing the beauties revealed to all eyes in their\r\nsimple majesty.\r\n\r\nImmensity of theme possesses no terrors for Mr. Church's essentially\r\nAmerican genius; his facile brush recoils not before the gigantic\r\nnatural elements of his own land, but deals as readily and composedly\r\nwith the unapproachable sublimity of Niagara and the terrible beauty of\r\nicebergs as with the peace of simple woodland scenes and the glowing\r\nsentiment of the tropics. To tread the beaten path of landscape\r\npainting, and offer to the public a tame transcript of the glories he\r\nhas beheld, is repugnant to the creative power of this true artist; but\r\nwhen form, color, and the legitimate means at his command fail to embody\r\nall he would express, his suggestive faculty is generally of force\r\nsufficient to reach all beholders, even those of feeblest imagination.\r\n\r\nIn standing before the _Falls of Niagara_, one can, in fancy, feel the\r\ncool moisture of spray, rising, incense-like, through a rainbow of\r\npromise, from the inspired canvas, together with the earth's tremor at\r\nthe roar of mad waters rushing headlong to a desperate death. This\r\ninestimable quality of suggestiveness is preserved in Mr. Church's\r\npictures when deprived of the aid of color and reduced to mere black and\r\nwhite in engraving, a fact bearing equally conclusive testimony to their\r\ninherent correctness of lines and elegance of composition.\r\n\r\nMr. Church's prominent characteristics of hardy vigor and adventurous\r\ntreatment of a subject, seem to have monopolized his artistic nature, to\r\nthe frequent exclusion of tenderness, either in idea or in the handling\r\nof color. The painting, in our eyes, least open to this objection, is\r\n_Twilight in the Wilderness_--a dreamy picture of inexpressible sadness,\r\nof a tearful silence that is felt, and of a loneliness too sacred to be\r\nprofaned by human intrusion. The gorgeous panorama of the _Heart of the\r\nAndes_, its snowy mountain peaks, and plains glowing with tropical\r\nverdure, is too bewildering in its complicated grandeur to excite dreams\r\nof beauty so tender and sadness so touching.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating this last-named picture, the demands on the attention\r\nare so numerous and weighty,--in the first place, to comprehend the\r\nsituation, and exchange at a moment's notice the stagnation of the\r\ntemperate zone for the emotional excitement of the tropics; then to\r\nseparate and classify the many points of beauty, to rise to the summits\r\nof distant mountains, sublime in their snowy crests, and sink again to\r\nearth at the foot of the rustic cross, by whose aid we may one day rise\r\nto sink no more,--to follow the painter successfully through this maze\r\nof thoughts, without the guiding light of his own matchless color, would\r\nseem a difficult and displeasing task. But the task has been\r\naccomplished with complete success, in an English line engraving of the\r\n_Heart of the Andes_, recently arrived in this country; which indication\r\nof popularity abroad conduces materially to the ever-growing fame of the\r\nartist. The same test, we believe, is in store for the _Icebergs_--with\r\nwhat result, time will show. Meanwhile, the picture itself will, on\r\nforeign soil, plead the cause of American civilization, and tend to\r\nassure those who look with dismay at the tumultuous upheavings of\r\nfreedom's home, that imperishable Art still maintains her placid sway in\r\nthis distracted land, and that her votaries falter not in their\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes pour out fiery lava under the red glare of the setting sun,\r\nobedient to Church's magic touch--delicate fancies are weaved into\r\npoetic life by the fingers of Gottschalk--but the voice of Poe, alas! is\r\nmute forever. The 'Lost Lenore,' found too late, may have inspired a\r\nsong far beyond the dull range of human comprehension, but poor mortals\r\nleft below, can only echo, with the grim and ghastly raven: _Nevermore!\r\nNevermore!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE SLAVE POWER; ITS CHARACTER, CAREER, AND PROBABLE DESIGNS: BEING\r\n     AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE REAL ISSUES INVOLVED IN THE AMERICAN\r\n     CONTEST. By J. E. CAIRNES, M.A., Professor of Jurisprudence and\r\n     Political Economy in Queen's College, Galway, and late Whately\r\n     Professor in the University of Dublin. Second edition. New York:\r\n     Carleton, 413 Broadway. London: Parker and Son & Co.\r\n\r\nIt is to be sincerely hoped that the American public, in its detestation\r\nof the ungenerous, narrow-minded, and inconsistent conduct of the\r\nmajority of Englishmen toward the Federal Union since the present war\r\nbegan, will not lose sight of the fact that, here and there in Great\r\nBritain, men of superior intelligence and information have labored\r\nstrenuously to make the truth known, and to vindicate our cause. Amid a\r\nmob of ignorant and furious foes of freedom, France has seen a Gasparin\r\nrise calm and great in superior knowledge, declaring incontrovertible\r\ntruths; and in like manner, the English press has given the views of\r\nStewart Mill and Professor Cairnes to their public, at a time when it\r\nseemed as if falsehood had completely triumphed. In 'The Slave Power,'\r\nthe latest work by this last-named writer, we have indeed such a\r\nsearching analysis of the present American crisis, and find the history\r\nof the entire difficulty set forth so fully, yet with such remarkable\r\nconciseness, that we cannot suppress a feeling of astonishment that a\r\ncountry which has slandered us so cruelly should, at the same time, have\r\ngiven to the world by far the best vindication of our cause which has as\r\nyet appeared. For it is no undue praise to say, that in this book we\r\nhave the completest defence of the Federal cause and the most effective\r\nonslaught on the Slave Power which any writer has thus far placed on\r\nrecord; and we cordially agree with the vigorous reviewer of the\r\n_Westminster_, in believing that a work more needed could scarcely have\r\nbeen produced at the present time, 'since,' as he adds, 'it contains\r\nmore than enough to give a new turn to English feeling on the subject,\r\nif those who guide and sway public opinion were ever likely to\r\nreconsider a question on which they have so deeply committed\r\nthemselves.'\r\n\r\n'The Slave Power,' it is true, contains little which has not, at one\r\ntime or another, been brought before the mind of the well-informed\r\nAmerican republican; yet it is precisely in this that its chief merit\r\nconsists, since it is not by idle oratory and fine writing, but by\r\n_facts_ and the plain truth, that we can be best vindicated. Englishmen\r\nare grossly ignorant of the true causes of this struggle, or of the\r\nprinciples involved--a matter little to be marvelled at, when we find\r\nalmost a majority of professed Federal Americans, under the name of\r\nDemocrats, cheerfully admitting that their confederate foes are quite in\r\nthe right as far as the _main_ cause of the difficulty is concerned. For\r\nall such men, a clear exposition of facts, logically set forth, cannot\r\nbe other than a real blessing; since their amiability to the South, when\r\nnot based on traitorous and selfish interests, means simply nothing more\r\nnor less than ignorance--and that of a kind which is little less than\r\ncriminal, let the guilt rest where it may.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cairnes begins judiciously by showing that in the beginning it\r\nwas believed, not without very apparent cause, in England, that our war\r\n'sprang from narrow and selfish views of sectional interests,' in which\r\nthe free-trading South was in the right, and that the abolition of\r\nslavery was a mere pretence by which the North sought, without a color\r\nof truth, to attract foreign sympathy. And when we remember for how long\r\na time slaves were returned by Federal officers to their owners, and how\r\npersistently anything like abolition, or even the most moderate\r\nemancipation, was earnestly and practically disowned by the Federal\r\npower, it is not wonderful, as Mr. Cairnes declares, that England should\r\nhave regarded our claim to be fighting for the cause of free labor as a\r\nshallow deceit. Even as we write, we have before us a journal containing\r\nan allusion to an officer who attempted to return to slavery a\r\ncontraband who had brought to him information of the greatest\r\nimportance. Yet, despite the frightful appearances against us, our\r\nwriter saw, through all, the truth, and declared that, as regarded the\r\npopular British abuse of this country, 'never was an explanation of a\r\npolitical catastrophe propounded, in more daring defiance of all the\r\ngreat and cardinal realities of the case with which it professed to\r\ndeal.'\r\n\r\nSlavery is the cause and core of our national difficulty. Secession and\r\nSouthern Rights have flourished in strength in exact ratio to the number\r\nof slaves in the States--nay, in the very counties in which slaves\r\nabounded. Slavery early developed a sectional class of politicians\r\ndevoted to one object, who, by the sheer force of intense, unscrupulous\r\napplication, from the year 1819 down to 1860, swayed our councils, gave\r\nan infamous character to American diplomacy, and stained our national\r\ncharacter. They are called the Free Trade Party: why was it, then, that\r\nthey never employed their power to accomplish that object, 'or how does\r\nit happen that, having submitted to the tariffs of 1832, 1842, and 1846,\r\nit should have resorted to the extreme measure of secession while under\r\nthe tariff of 1857--a comparatively Free Trade law'? 'From 1842 down to\r\n1860, the tendency of Federal legislation was distinctly in the\r\ndirection of Free Trade.' 'If Free Trade was their main object, why did\r\nthe Southern senators withdraw from their posts precisely at the time\r\nwhen their presence was most required to secure their cherished\r\nprinciple?' Or why did they not apply to their supple and infamous tool,\r\nBuchanan, to veto the bill? _Because they wished it to pass_--to make\r\npolitical capital against the North in England; and they accordingly\r\naided its passage, Mr. Toombs being in the Senate, and actually voting\r\nfor it! Or if it was a Free Trade question, why was it that the Western\r\nStates did not take part with them?\r\n\r\nThe North, however, did not take up arms to destroy slavery, but the\r\nRight of Secession, since that was the irritating _point d'honneur_,\r\nand, what was more, the real first cause of injury which at first\r\npresented itself. Mr. Lincoln had cause to know that in the beginning,\r\neven in the South itself, secession was only the work of a turbulent\r\nminority. 'To have yielded would have been to have written himself down\r\nbefore the world as incompetent--nay, as a traitor to the cause which he\r\nhad just sworn to defend.' In short, we were misunderstood--painfully\r\nso--and it is not a matter of indifference to learn that at last there\r\nis a reaction of intelligence in our favor, and that light is breaking\r\nthrough the bewildering mists which once veiled the truth.\r\n\r\nIn discussing 'the economic basis of slavery,' Professor Cairnes deals\r\nout truths with a prompt vigor which is truly admirable. From Stirling,\r\nOlmsted, Sewell, and others, he disposes of the old falsehood that only\r\nthe negro can endure the Southern climate--a fact but recently\r\n_generally_ made known at the North--that isothermal lines do not follow\r\nthe parallels of latitude--and that it is a gross error to believe the\r\nblack incapable of improvement as a freeman. He admits that slave labor\r\nhas its advantages, in being absolutely controllable, and in returning\r\nthe whole fruit of its labor to the owner. It may, therefore, be\r\ncombined on an extensive scale, and its cost is trifling. But, on the\r\nother hand, slave labor is given reluctantly, and is consequently a\r\nlosing means, unless much of it can be concentrated under the eye of one\r\noverseer. It is unskillful, because the slave cannot be educated; and,\r\ntherefore, having once learned one thing, he must be kept at that for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe result of this is that, as the slave, unlike the free farm-laborer,\r\ncannot (with rare exceptions) be profitably employed at aught save\r\nagriculture, and indeed only at one branch of that, he soon exhausts the\r\nsoil. If all the blacks in the South were capable of laboring at\r\nrotation of crops, they would soon be free. Slavery has always of itself\r\ndied out in the wheat and corn regions--because, in raising cereals,\r\nlabor is more widely dispersed than in cotton or tobacco planting, and\r\nthe workers are more difficult to oversee. Hence the constant\r\nimmigration from the wornout to the new plantation, and the cry for new\r\nland; and hence the admission, by the most intelligent men of the South,\r\nthat to prevent the extension of slavery would be to destroy it. Free\r\nlabor flourishes even on barren soils--ingenuity is stimulated and\r\nscience developed. But slave labor requires abundance of fertile soil\r\nand a branch of culture demanding combination and organization of large\r\nmasses of labor and its _concentration_.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of these facts, a writer in the London _Saturday Review_\r\ninforms the English public that the rapid deterioration of the soil\r\nunder slave labor is a popular fallacy! Could the gentleman who gives\r\nthis information so glibly, examine, we do not say Virginia, but simply\r\nthat lower county of Delaware which has adhered somewhat to the old\r\nSouthern slave system, in contradistinction to its two sisters, he might\r\nhave distinctly ascertained if the exhaustion of soil by slave labor be\r\na fallacy. Again, if the profits of slavery be only for the master, it\r\nmay be true that the same process which enriches him impoverishes the\r\ncountry at large; and this is really the case through all the South.\r\nFree labor shuns slave society: a few Northern men may here and there\r\nlive in the South, but as a rule the negro makes the poor white meaner\r\nthan himself. It is true that free white labor in new lands is very\r\nexhaustive--but in time it takes them up again and restores them: this\r\nthe negro never does, and never can do.\r\n\r\nThe tendencies of slavery to render the white man insolent, arrogant,\r\nand oligarchical, are well pointed out by Professor Cairnes, and with\r\nthem the evil tendencies of slave societies. It makes bad white men, and\r\nintolerable political neighbors. In the ancient world, slaves were\r\nconstantly being educated, freed, and made equal to their masters; but\r\nin the confederacy, everything is done to crush them lower and lower;\r\nand in these facts lie _perdu_ the future further degradation of every\r\npoor white in the South, the constant increase of power and capital in\r\nthe hands of a few, and the diminution in number even of these few.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Virginians breed slaves expressly for sale is well exposed\r\nin this book. Our author is kind enough to believe that they never raise\r\na single negro for the _express purpose_ of selling him or her; but we,\r\nwho live nearer the 'sacred soil,' know better. It is not many days\r\nsince a farmer in our present immediate vicinity, on the Southern\r\nPennsylvania line, found himself obliged to dismiss a fine six-foot\r\nnegro runaway from Virginia, whom he had hired, on account of the entire\r\ninability of the contraband to do the simplest farm tasks. 'What _is_\r\nthe reason you can't stand work?' inquired the amazed farmer. 'Why,\r\nmass', to tell de trufe, I wasn't brought up to wuck (work), but to\r\n_sell_. If I'd been wucked too hard, it ud a spiled my looks fo' de\r\nmarkit.' Professor Cairnes may accept the sorrowful assurances of more\r\nthan one person, who has been taken frequently enough into the councils\r\nof 'the enemy' in bygone times (_crede experto Ruperto_), that slaves\r\n_are_ begotten, born, bred, and raised for the Southern market--as much\r\nso as any pigs--and that, too, by eminently aristocratic and highly\r\nrefined scions of first families. Now that we can and dare speak the\r\ntruth, it is not amiss to do so. We recall the day when to have taken\r\npart in the charge of the Six Hundred would have been a trifle of\r\nbravery compared to making the above truthful statement--for any one who\r\nvalued social standing, or indeed a whole skin--on the border. Whether\r\ntheir own children were sold may be imagined from an anecdote long\r\ncurrent in Virginia, relative to ex-Governor Wise, who, in a certain law\r\ncase where he was opposed by a Northern trader, decided of a certain\r\nslave, that the chattel, being a mulatto, was of more value than 'a\r\nmolangeon.' 'And what, in the name of God, _is_ a molungeon?' inquired\r\nthe astonished 'Northern man.' 'A _mulatto_,' replied Wise, is the child\r\nof a female house-servant by young master'--a molungeon is the offspring\r\nof a field hand by a Yankee peddler.'\r\n\r\nMr. Cairnes has, we doubt not, often heard of mulattoes--they constitute\r\nthe great majority of Virginia slaves. But did he ever hear of\r\n'molungeons'?\r\n\r\nMr. Cairnes justly denies the common theory that the South has\r\nmaintained paramount political sway in the Union by a superior capacity\r\nfor politics. He declares that men whose interests and ideas are\r\nconcentrated in a very narrow range, on one object, have vast advantage\r\nover their intellectual superiors, when the latter pursue no such single\r\ncourse. He might have added that the young Southern gentleman, when not\r\nintended for a physician, almost invariably devotes to mere provincial\r\npolitics and the arts of declamation and debate, all of those\r\nintellectual energies which the Northerner applies to business, art,\r\ncommerce, literature, and other solidly useful occupations. If the\r\nSoutherner has an inborn superior _talent_ for politics, why is it that,\r\nas in the case of British or French statesmen, he never develops the\r\nslightest talent for _literature_? So notoriously is this the case, that\r\neven the first writers of the South, especially for the press, are\r\ngenerally broken-down Northern literary hacks, or miserable Irish and\r\nEnglish refugees. Mr. Cairnes quotes De Bow's _Review_. He might be\r\namazed, could he examine a number of that remarkable periodical, at the\r\nquality of the English written by some of the most eminent philosophers,\r\npatriots, and politicians of the confederacy!\r\n\r\nThe history of the Slave Power, as set forth in Louisiana, Missouri and\r\nits Compromise, the Mexican war, Kansas, the rise of the Republican\r\nParty, the Dred Scott decision, the attempt of John Brown, and\r\nsecession, are given in a masterly manner in this work, and with a\r\nmiraculous appreciation of truths. Not less vigorous and shrewd is the\r\nchapter devoted to the designs of the Slave Power, in which the future\r\ncapacity of that power to do illimitable mischief is set forth in a\r\nmanner which will be new even to the great mass of American Republican\r\nreaders. If we differ with him in his 'Conclusion,' it is that we may be\r\nconsistent to his earlier position. We do not agree with him when he\r\nadvocates the giving permission to the South to secede with the\r\nMississippi as their western boundary. Penned up by North and West, and\r\nwith their ports occupied by us, the South would soon decay. But we\r\nrather believe the North, brought to the tremendous trial of a test\r\nbetween aristocracy and republicanism, will yet conquer by destroying\r\nslavery and giving the poor whites of the South their rights. But we\r\ncannot conclude without expressing the earnest hope that this book will\r\nbe read, and that thoroughly, by every intelligent American. There is at\r\npresent a reaction rapidly forming in England in favor of the Federal\r\ncause, and we foresee that this extraordinary work--the best summary in\r\nexistence of our principles, and the most overwhelming stylus-stroke\r\nwhich slavery has ever received--is destined to be of incalculable\r\nservice to the great cause. Let it circulate by the hundred\r\nthousand!--and do you, dear reader, do your part by perusing it, and\r\nmaking its merits known to all. In connection with it, we commend the\r\nreview in the _Westminster_ already referred to. It is pleasant to\r\nrealize that we have friends among enemies. Let us hope that when\r\nbrighter days come, our Government and our people will not be unmindful\r\nof those who defended us in the days of darkness and dole. We owe a\r\ngreat debt of gratitude to such men as Professor Cairnes, and must not\r\nbe slack in paying it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LES MISERABLES. No. IV. _St. Denis._ By VICTOR HUGO. New York:\r\n    Carleton.\r\n\r\nA great improvement on the preceding miserable trio, yet still far from\r\nfulfilling the extravagant assertions as to its merit with which the\r\npress has been deluged. We see in this novel, historic pictures, not\r\nwithout accuracy, details of life which are true enough, and, we might\r\nadd, familiar enough, from a thousand _feuilletons_, but we find no\r\nPURPOSE, corresponding to the expectations excited. We have every\r\nvariety of miserable wretch imaginable paraded before us, without a hint\r\nof any means of curing their social disease. 'There is a hammer for\r\ntearing down, but no trowel for building up,' beyond a little empty talk\r\non the benefits to be derived from education. The truth is that Victor\r\nHugo writes, like too many of his nation, simply for sensation and\r\neffect. The fault to be found with this series is, that, like Jack\r\nSheppard, it degrades the taste and blunts the feelings--in a word, it\r\nvulgarizes, and is as improper reading for the young, so far as _effect_\r\nis concerned, as the most immoral production extant. Vulgarity is the\r\nopen doorway to vice, and, philosophize as we may, sketches of thieves\r\nand vagabonds, _gamins_, prostitutes and liars are vulgar and unfit\r\nreading for youthful minds, if not for any minds whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ABEL DRAKE'S WIFE. By JOHN SAUNDERS. New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nThe reader is well aware that this work has attained a great\r\npopularity--we may add that it has deserved it, being a work of marked\r\noriginality; one of characters and feelings which will even bear at\r\nsundry times reperusal: as good a character as can be given to a novel,\r\nand a far better one than we are disposed to award to the majority of\r\nthose which we meet. It is, we should say, in justice to the progressive\r\npowers of the author, far superior to his earlier productions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the noble Message of President LINCOLN, there are two paragraphs\r\nwhich should be committed to memory and constantly recalled by every\r\nman:\r\n\r\n     'Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and\r\n     this Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No\r\n     personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of\r\n     us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down into\r\n     honor or dishonor to the highest generation.\r\n\r\n     'We say 'we are for the Union!' The world will not forget that we\r\n     say this. We know how to save this Union. _The world knows we know\r\n     how to save it._ We--even we here--hold the power and bear the\r\n     responsibility!'\r\n\r\n'We cannot escape history.' And this is true, not only of the Congress\r\nand of the Administration, but of all men who at the present day are\r\nraised one fraction above the veriest obscurity and completest\r\nnothing-ism. You, reader, and series of those whom you daily meet, may\r\nfancy that your deeds, speeches, writings, overshadowed as they are by\r\nthe greater men and events of the day, will be forgotten. It is not so.\r\n\r\nThe last age was more antiquarian, more given to collecting, searching,\r\nand recording, than its predecessor. This present one is, however, a\r\nhundredfold more seeking and more chronicling than the last, and this\r\ntendency increases every year. As it is, scarce a hero or a traitor,\r\neven of the Revolution, is escaping glory or infamy. Will it be less the\r\ncase with the good and bad men of the Emancipation? There is not one\r\namong them who shall escape history.\r\n\r\nThere is no thieving contractor, no 'helping' official, no shoddy\r\nscoundrel, no unrighteously 'commission' gathering leech, who is not\r\nquietly noted down here and there, to be duly exposed, some soon--some\r\nin after years. We know that extensive researches have been undertaken,\r\nto prepare and keep in black and white a record of the rascality of this\r\nwar, in high places as well as low. _They shall not escape history._\r\n\r\nThere is no cowardly, dishonest, selfish politician--be he who he\r\nmay--no trimmer and truckler to the times--who will be forgotten. The\r\nmost important war of all history--the greatest and most clearly\r\noutlined struggle between Aristocracy and Republicanism--will not pass\r\naway into oblivion. Men will toil away their lives that they may revive\r\nsome of the salient points of this great fight for freedom. To\r\ncommemorate the good, they must set forth the opposition of the bad--of\r\nthose who aided the foe either by approving of endless slavery, by\r\nclogging the action of the Administration, or by turning the hardly\r\nearned income of Government, wrung from a suffering people, to their own\r\nprofit. They shall not escape history.\r\n\r\nThose who had the ability to aid the great cause of truth in any way, by\r\nbrain or hand, and yet who did nothing--verily they shall not escape\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe cautious, shrewd fellows, who hurrah loudly for the truth--after it\r\nhas become safe and profitable to do so--they who run with the hound and\r\nhold with the hare--they may chuckle to themselves in their day, and\r\nrejoice at their shrewdness-but Time and GOD sift all things, however\r\nsmall--even such men as these. They shall not escape history.\r\n\r\nAnd let them cry, 'After us the Deluge,' who will. You will live again\r\nin your children; the heritage of sin is repaid with compound interest\r\nto your name. How do you know but there is a GOD and a future knowledge\r\nof all this, that you act so boldly? What evil have your children or\r\nyour name done you, that you should lay a curse on them? For if you do\r\nnot put forth your hand to the great cause of truth and in the great\r\nbattle of the LORD on behalf of Freedom, be certain that you are now\r\nshaping a malediction, and awaking the anathema maranatha, which shall\r\ngo down into the deepest ages, and even in many lands, to cover you and\r\nyours with the dark shadow of shame forever. You shall not escape\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nBut neither shall they escape who have fought the good fight for truth,\r\nfor man and liberty. Truly, as the German proverb hath it, _Zeit bricht\r\nRosen und Zeit bringt Rosen_--'Time breaks roses--but Time brings them\r\nalso.' There is an age coming which will distinguish between the battles\r\nfor conquest and idle glory and the honor of kings, and those which were\r\nfought for holy freedom. In that age, the great and good and wise, yes!\r\neven the smallest and weakest who chose the cause of Truth, will be\r\nprized above the men of all battles which ever were beforetime. Stand\r\nfast, O soldier! be firm, O friend of the good cause! let us see this\r\nthing bravely through to the end, come what may. GOD bless you!--and he\r\n_will_ bless you! Die on the battle field, or labor humbly at home--if\r\nyour heart and your hand have been given to the good work, you shall not\r\nescape history.\r\n\r\n   'Fate for you shall sheathe her shears,\r\n   You shall live some thousand years.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been nobly proposed, and we doubt not that the proposition will\r\nbe as nobly realized, that a shipload of food be sent to the relief of\r\nthe starving operatives of England. If the wealthy classes of Great\r\nBritain were generous in proportion to the same order of men in this\r\ncountry, and in proportion to their own riches, it would be simply\r\nabsurd for us to offer to relieve their paupers. But they are not so;\r\nand it is a matter to be deeply deplored, that the manufacturers who\r\nhave made fortunes from their operatives, are, in Great Britain, the\r\nones who are least inclined to relieve the sufferings of their poor\r\ndependants. And this we state entirely on the authority of the British\r\npress, and from the comments made by it on a recent and wretchedly\r\nabortive effort to collect from manufacturing capitalists somewhat to\r\nfeed the poor who had enriched them. To an American, accustomed to hear\r\nof deeds of generosity and public spirit, the list of moneys subscribed\r\nfor such an object, against the names of millionaires, would seem\r\nincredibly beggarly and pitiful.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, some one must feed the poor; and if John Bull\r\ncannot afford it, Jonathan must. There is a degree of suffering in which\r\nEnglishman or confederate rebel becomes simply a suffering brother, and\r\nwhen he who would not act the good Samaritan becomes most truly an\r\noutlaw to all humanity. Therefore, let there be, not one, but many\r\nshiploads sent to the sufferers--let us cast our bread upon the waters,\r\nliterally as well as figuratively, and give no heed or thought to its\r\nreturn. The London _Times_ will, we presume, impugn the motives of the\r\ncharity--call it Pecksniffian and Heep-ish--or possibly try to prove\r\nthat the Federals had no hand in the good deed. Let it rave--the\r\nbusiness in hand is to feed starving men, women, and children, and not\r\nto make political capital, or gain glory, or please a party--for that we\r\nmost assuredly shall not--but to do good and act in the large-hearted\r\nmanner which gives a good conscience, and which as a national trait is\r\nthe noblest characteristic of a republican.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe South has been quicker than the North in perceiving that public\r\nopinion in England is rapidly changing in certain quarters in favor of\r\nthe Federal cause, and it is for this reason that the press in Secessia\r\nhas of late been so unamiable toward Great Britain, while SEMMES has\r\nshown in his pirating so little kindness to English goods. Possibly\r\nSecessia may after all discover that she might do a more unprofitable\r\nthing than be in alliance offensive and defensive with us, and that she\r\nmight go further and fare worse, either alone, or with foreign friends\r\nwho are, after all, only foes in disguise.\r\n\r\nBut it is a mad and a foolish thing for England to hope to be benefited\r\nby our dissension. Have we grown weaker or less dangerous by the\r\ndiscovery that we are capable of raising the greatest armies and the\r\nmost invincible fleets in the world? While we flourish in prosperity, we\r\nafford her an outlet for all her paupers, thieves, vagabond Bohemians,\r\nand refuse of all sorts, to say nothing of the vast mass of the really\r\nindustrious poor who do well here, but who would have starved to death\r\nat home. With one person in eight in Great Britain dying as a pauper and\r\nburied at the public expense, it is hardly expedient for its people to\r\nwish to see us ruined. Were we to exclude her vagabonds and paupers by\r\nan alien act from entering this country, and at the same time close our\r\nmarkets to her goods, of what avail would all the cotton in the world be\r\nto her? The American public understand this thing perfectly--so\r\nperfectly that the first movement toward intervention would be to\r\neffectually shut out the offending party, to bear by itself the worst\r\nresults of prostrated manufactures and a turbulent starving population.\r\n\r\nBut we trust that nothing of the kind may happen, and that England will\r\nperceive that a great, prosperous, and united America, though it covers\r\nthe whole Western hemisphere, will be of more advantage to her than a\r\ndivided, impoverished land, full of fighting factions. It is a bad, an\r\ninhuman, and a most un-Christian policy to set wealthy and powerful\r\nneighbors at dissensions, to rejoice at their losses, and finally hope\r\nto see them from prosperous citizens, turned into starved brigands. Envy\r\nis of the devil. And it is the more wicked, because _we_ know, and every\r\none of our readers knows with us, that there never existed in this\r\ncountry, within our recollection, any desire whatever to see England\r\nimpoverished, injured, or in any way 'set back' as a country. That\r\ndeep-seated desire, openly avowed by her orators and press, to see our\r\ngrowing greatness checked, was never seriously cherished by any true\r\nAmerican--and it could be proved that the insulting expressions of such\r\na desire have in almost every instance originated with British _emigres_\r\nin this country, who are notoriously the most bitter foes to their\r\nfatherland.\r\n\r\nIt is finally worth noting that the sympathy expressed by Americans for\r\nRussia during the Crimean war, has been of late frequently urged in\r\nEngland as a reason for withholding sympathy from the Federals. Now it\r\nis most _undeniably true_ that, with certain rare exceptions, the\r\nfriendship for Russia _at that time_ came in a great measure from the\r\nDemocratic party, and especially from the South. It was an Irish\r\nantipathy to England in the North, and a serf-sympathy in the South\r\nwhich caused it all--naturally enough, in all conscience. If any one\r\ndoubts this, let him recall Roger Pryor's book, indorsing Russia as the\r\ngreat power destined to swallow up all Europe--written at a time when\r\nPryor was beyond question the first and loudest exponent living of\r\nSouthern feelings and principles. This is the simplest and plainest of\r\nfacts, most easily susceptible of proof--and yet how many Englishmen are\r\nthere who would believe it?\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the whole criticism of America by England has\r\npresented the melancholy spectacle of prejudice and envy, made maudlin\r\nby gross ignorance--and the worst of it all has been the making the\r\nNorth responsible for the bygone evil deeds of the South. Repudiation,\r\nprotection, Russian sympathy, filibustering, and other objections--are\r\nall heaped on the Federal head alone to bear? Will the _truth_ ever come\r\nto light in England?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMay we venture to mention to our readers that 'Among the\r\nPines'--originally published in these pages--is now selling its\r\n_thirtieth_ thousand, with constantly increasing orders. And in\r\nconnection we would add that 'Americans in Rome'--originally published\r\nin THE CONTINENTAL under the title of _Maccaroni and Canvas_ has\r\nappeared in book form, and may be obtained from George P. Putnam. This\r\nwork is, we believe, one of the most remarkable collections of sketches\r\nand observation ever written on Italy; combining a very great amount of\r\naccurate personal observations of the Roman people, both in the city and\r\ncountry, with that of American artists' life there. The observations are\r\nthroughout racily humorous, and those who have within a few years\r\nvisited 'the Cradle of Art' cannot fail to recognize, as hit off with no\r\nsparing hand, more than one American notoriety. Art quackery as it\r\nexists, is well shown up in 'Americans in Rome;' the author having\r\nlittle in common with those amiable romancers who glorify every\r\nilliterate picture-maker, though he never fails to do justice to true\r\ngenius. We believe, in short, that these sketches form a very peculiar,\r\npiquant, and _earnest_ work, as truthful as it is amusing, and as such\r\ncommend it to our readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL MONTHLY:\r\n\r\nEDITORS:\r\n\r\n   HON. ROBERT J. WALKER,\r\n   CHARLES G. LELAND,\r\n   HON. FRED. P. STANTON,\r\n   EDMUND KIRKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe readers of the CONTINENTAL are aware of the important position it\r\nhas assumed, of the influence which it exerts, and of the brilliant\r\narray of political and literary talent of the highest order which\r\nsupports it. No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the latter is\r\nabundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection of its\r\ncounsels in many important public events, and in the character and power\r\nof those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nBy the accession of HON. ROBERT J. WALKER and HON. F. P. STANTON to its\r\neditorial corps, the CONTINENTAL acquires a strength and a political\r\nsignificance which, to those who are aware of the ability and experience\r\nof these gentlemen, must elevate it to a position far above any\r\npreviously occupied by any publication of the kind in America.\r\nPreserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a thousand\r\njournals have attributed to it, it will at once greatly enlarge its\r\ncircle of action, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle\r\ninvolved in the great questions of the day. The first minds of the\r\ncountry, embracing men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are to become its contributors; and it is no\r\nmere \"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say, that this \"magazine\r\nfor the times\" will employ the first intellect in America, under\r\nauspices which no publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nCHARLES GODFREY LELAND, the accomplished scholar and author, who has\r\ntill now been the sole Editor of the Magazine, will, beside his\r\neditorial labors, continue his brilliant contributions to its pages; and\r\nEDMUND KIRKE, author of \"AMONG THE PINES,\" will contribute to each\r\nissue, having already begun a work on Southern Life and Society, which,\r\nwill be found far more widely descriptive, and, in all respects,\r\nsuperior to the first.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the great\r\nquestions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal: much the\r\nlarger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore, by\r\ntales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be found,\r\nunder its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and presenting\r\nattractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n   Two copies for one year,         Five dollars.\r\n   Three copies for one year,       Seven dollars.\r\n   Six copies for one year,         Thirteen dollars.\r\n   Eleven copies for one year,      Twenty-four dollars.\r\n   Twenty copies for one year,      Forty-four dollars.\r\n\r\nPAID IN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n_Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, TO BE PAID BY THE SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\nThree Dollars a year, IN ADVANCE.--_Postage paid by the Publisher._\r\n\r\nJOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 50 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 85,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. DAIRY FARMING also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\n_The experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS,\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n   80 acres at $10 per acre. with interest at 6 per ct. annually\r\n   on the following terms:\r\n\r\n   Cash payment                $48.00\r\n   Payments in one year         48.00\r\n     \"      in two years        48.00\r\n     \"      in three years      48.00\r\n     \"      in four years      236.00\r\n     \"      in five years      224.00\r\n     \"      in six years       212.00\r\n     \"      in seven years     300.00\r\n\r\n   40 acres at $10 per acre;\r\n   Cash payment                $24.00\r\n   Payments in one year         24.00\r\n     \"      in two years        24.00\r\n     \"      in three years      24.00\r\n     \"      in four years      118.00\r\n     \"      in five years      112.00\r\n     \"      in six years       106.00\r\n     \"      in seven years     100.00\r\n\r\nAddress Land Commissioner, Illinois Central Railroad, Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber 14\r\n\r\n25 Cents\r\n\r\nThe CONTINENTAL MONTHLY.\r\n\r\nDEVOTED TO Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK:\r\n\r\nJOHN F.
