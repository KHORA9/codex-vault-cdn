The materials for her book\r\nhave been taken from official documents. The sad revelation of broken\r\nfaith, of violated treaties, and of inhuman deeds of violence will bring\r\na flush of shame to the cheeks of those who love their country. They\r\nwill wonder how our rulers have dared to so trifle with justice, and\r\nprovoke the anger of God. Many of the stories will be new to the reader.\r\nThe Indian owns no telegraph, employs no press reporter, and his side of\r\nthe story is unknown to the people.\r\n\r\nNations, like individuals, reap exactly what they sow; they who sow\r\nrobbery reap robbery. The seed-sowing of iniquity replies in a harvest\r\nof blood. The American people have accepted as truth the teaching that\r\nthe Indians were a degraded, brutal race of savages, whom it was the\r\nwill of God should perish at the approach of civilization. If they do\r\nnot say with our Puritan fathers that these are the Hittites who are to\r\nbe driven out before the saints of the Lord, they do accept the teaching\r\nthat manifest destiny will drive the Indians from the earth. The\r\ninexorable has no tears or pity at the cries of anguish of the doomed\r\nrace. Ahab never speaks kindly of Naboth, whom he has robbed of his\r\nvineyard. It soothes conscience to cast mud on the character of the one\r\nwhom we have wronged.\r\n\r\nThe people have laid the causes of Indian wars at the door of the Indian\r\ntrader, the people on the border, the Indian agents, the army, and the\r\nDepartment of the Interior. None of these are responsible for the Indian\r\nwars, which have cost the United States five hundred millions of dollars\r\nand tens of thousands of valuable lives. In the olden time the Indian\r\ntrader was the Indian's friend. The relation was one of mutual\r\ndependence. If the trader oppressed the Indian he was in danger of\r\nlosing his debt; if the Indian refused to pay his debts, the trader must\r\nleave the country. The factors and agents of the old fur companies tell\r\nus that their goods were as safe in the unguarded trading-post as in the\r\ncivilized village. The pioneer settlers have had too much at stake to\r\nexcite an Indian massacre, which would overwhelm their loved ones in\r\nruin. The army are not responsible for Indian wars; they are \"men under\r\nauthority,\" who go where they are sent. The men who represent the honor\r\nof the nation have a tradition that lying is a disgrace, and that theft\r\nforfeits character. General Crook expressed the feeling of the army when\r\nhe replied to a friend who said, \"It is hard to go on such a campaign.\"\r\n\"Yes, it is hard; but, sir, the hardest thing is to go and fight those\r\nwhom you know are in the right.\" The Indian Bureau is often unable to\r\nfulfil the treaties, because Congress has failed to make the\r\nappropriations. If its agents are not men of the highest character, it\r\nis largely due to the fact that we send a man to execute this difficult\r\ntrust at a remote agency, and expect him to support himself and family\r\non $1500 a year. The Indian Bureau represents a system which is a\r\nblunder and a crime.\r\n\r\nThe Indian is the only human being within our territory who has no\r\nindividual right in the soil. He is not amenable to or protected by law.\r\nThe executive, the legislative, and judicial departments of the\r\nGovernment recognize that he has a possessory right in the soil; but his\r\ntitle is merged in the tribe—the man has no standing before the law. A\r\nChinese or a Hottentot would have, but the native American is left\r\npitiably helpless. This system grew out of our relations at the first\r\nsettlement of the country. The isolated settlements along the Atlantic\r\ncoast could not ask the Indians, who outnumbered them ten to one, to\r\naccept the position of wards. No wise policy was adopted, with altered\r\ncircumstances, to train the Indians for citizenship. Treaties were made\r\nof the same binding force of the constitution; but these treaties were\r\nunfilled. It may be doubted whether one single treaty has ever been\r\nfulfilled as it would have been if it had been made with a foreign\r\npower. The treaty has been made as between two independent sovereigns.\r\nSometimes each party has been ignorant of the wishes of the other; for\r\nthe heads of both parties to the treaty have been on the interpreter's\r\nshoulders, and he was the owned creature of corrupt men, who desired to\r\nuse the Indians as a key to unlock the nation's treasury. Pledges,\r\nsolemnly made, have been shamelessly violated. The Indian has had no\r\nredress but war. In these wars ten white men were killed to one Indian,\r\nand the Indians who were killed have cost the Government a hundred\r\nthousand dollars each. Then came a new treaty, more violated faith,\r\nanother war, until we have not a hundred miles between the Atlantic and\r\nPacific which has not been the scene of an Indian massacre.\r\n\r\nAll this while Canada has had no Indian wars. Our Government has\r\nexpended for the Indians a hundred dollars to their one. They recognize,\r\nas we do, that the Indian has a possessory right to the soil. They\r\npurchase this right, as we do, by treaty; but their treaties are made\r\nwith _the Indian subjects_ of Her Majesty. They set apart a _permanent_\r\nreservation for them; they seldom remove Indians; they select agents of\r\nhigh character, who receive their appointments for life; they make fewer\r\npromises, but they fulfil them; they give the Indians Christian\r\nmissions, which have the hearty support of Christian people, and all\r\ntheir efforts are toward self-help and civilization. An incident will\r\nillustrate the two systems. The officer of the United States Army who\r\nwas sent to receive Alaska from the Russian Government stopped in\r\nBritish Columbia. Governor Douglas had heard that an Indian had been\r\nmurdered by another Indian. He visited the Indian tribe; he explained to\r\nthem that the murdered man was a subject of Her Majesty; he demanded the\r\nculprit. The murderer was surrendered, was tried, was found guilty, and\r\nwas hanged. On reaching Alaska the officer happened to enter the Greek\r\nchurch, and saw on the altar a beautiful copy of the Gospels in a costly\r\nbinding studded with jewels. He called upon the Greek bishop, and said,\r\n\"Your Grace, I called to say you had better remove that copy of the\r\nGospels from the church, for it may be stolen.\" The bishop replied, \"Why\r\nshould I remove it? It was the gift of the mother of the emperor, and\r\nhas lain on the altar seventy years.\" The officer blushed, and said,\r\n\"There is no law in the Indian country, and I was afraid it might be\r\nstolen.\" The bishop said, \"The book is in God's house, and it is His\r\nbook, and I shall not take it away.\" The book remained. The country\r\nbecame ours, and the next day the Gospel was stolen.\r\n\r\nOur Indian wars are needless and wicked. The North American Indian is\r\nthe noblest type of a heathen man on the earth. He recognizes a Great\r\nSpirit; he believes in immortality; he has a quick intellect; he is a\r\nclear thinker; he is brave and fearless, and, until betrayed, he is true\r\nto his plighted faith; he has a passionate love for his children, and\r\ncounts it joy to die for his people. Our most terrible wars have been\r\nwith the noblest types of the Indians, and with men who had been the\r\nwhite man's friend. Nicolet said the Sioux were the finest type of wild\r\nmen he had ever seen. Old traders say that it used to be the boast of\r\nthe Sioux that they had never taken the life of a white man. Lewis and\r\nClarke, Governor Stevens, and Colonel Steptoe bore testimony to the\r\ndevoted friendship of the Nez Percés for the white man. Colonel Boone,\r\nColonel Bent, General Harney, and others speak in the highest praise of\r\nthe Cheyennes. The Navahoes were a semi-civilized people.\r\n\r\nOur best friends have suffered more deeply from our neglect and violated\r\nfaith than our most bitter foes. Peaceable Indians often say, \"You leave\r\nus to suffer; if we killed your people, then you would take care of us.\"\r\n\r\nOur Indian wars have not come wholly from violated faith. In time of\r\npeace it has been our policy to establish \"almshouses\" to train and\r\neducate savage paupers. We have purchased paint, beads, scalping-knives,\r\nto deck warriors, and have fed them in idleness at the agency. Around\r\nthis agency and along the border were gathered influences to degrade the\r\nsavage, and sink him to a depth his fathers had never known. It has only\r\nneeded a real or a fancied wrong to have this pauperized savagery break\r\nout in deeds of blood. Under President Grant a new departure was taken.\r\nThe peace policy was little more than a name. No change was made in the\r\nIndian system; no rights of property were given; no laws were passed to\r\nprotect the Indians. The President did take the nomination of Indian\r\nagents from politicians, who had made the office a reward for political\r\nservice. He gave the nomination of Indian agents to the executive\r\ncommittees of the missionary societies of the different churches. Where\r\nthese Christian bodies established schools and missions, and the\r\nGovernment cast its influence on the side of labor, it was a success.\r\nMore has been done to civilize the Indians in the past twelve years than\r\nin any period of our history. The Indian Ring has fought the new policy\r\nat every step; and yet, notwithstanding our Indian wars, our violated\r\ntreaties, and our wretched system, thousands of Indians, who were poor,\r\ndegraded savages, are now living as Christian, civilized men. There was\r\na time when it seemed impossible to secure the attention of the\r\nGovernment to any wrongs done to the Indians: it is not so to-day. The\r\nGovernment does listen to the friends of the Indians, and many of the\r\ngrosser forms of robbery are stopped. No permanent reform can be secured\r\nuntil the heart of the people is touched. In 1862 I visited Washington,\r\nto lay before the Administration the causes which had desolated our fair\r\nState with the blood of those slain by Indian massacre. After pleading\r\nin vain, and finding no redress, Secretary Stanton said to a friend,\r\n\"What does the Bishop want? If he came here to tell us that our Indian\r\nsystem is a sink of iniquity, tell him we all know it. Tell him the\r\nUnited States never cures a wrong until the people demand it; and when\r\nthe hearts of the people are reached the Indian will be saved.\" In this\r\nbook the reader will find the sad story of a century—no, not the whole\r\nstory, but the fragmentary story of isolated tribes. The author will\r\nhave her reward if it shall aid in securing justice to a noble and a\r\nwronged race. Even with the sad experiences of the past we have not\r\nlearned justice. The Cherokees and other tribes received the Indian\r\nTerritory as a compensation and atonement for one of the darkest crimes\r\never committed by a Christian nation. That territory was conveyed to\r\nthem by legislation as strong as the wit of statesmen could devise. The\r\nfathers who conveyed this territory to the Cherokees are dead. Greedy\r\neyes covet the land. The plans are laid to wrest it from its rightful\r\nowners. If this great iniquity is consummated, these Indians declare\r\nthat all hope in our justice will die out of their hearts, and that they\r\nwill defend their country with their lives.\r\n\r\nThe work of reform is a difficult one; it will cost us time, effort, and\r\nmoney; it will demand the best thoughts of the best men in the country.\r\nWe shall have to regain the confidence of our Indian wards by honest\r\ndealing and the fulfilment of our promises. Now the name of a white man\r\nis to the Indians a synonyme for \"liar.\" Red Cloud recently paid a visit\r\nto the Black Hills, and was hospitably entertained by his white friends.\r\nIn bidding them good-bye he expressed the hope that, if they did not\r\nmeet again on earth, they might meet beyond the grave \"in a land where\r\nwhite men ceased to be liars.\"\r\n\r\nDark as the history is, there is a brighter side. No missions to the\r\nheathen have been more blessed than those among the Indians. Thousands,\r\nwho were once wild, painted savages, finding their greatest joy in deeds\r\nof war, are now the disciples of the Prince of Peace. There are Indian\r\nchurches with Indian congregations, in which Indian clergy are telling\r\nthe story of God's love in Jesus Christ our Saviour. Where once was only\r\nheard the medicine-drum and the song of the scalp-dance, there is now\r\nthe bell calling Christians to prayer, and songs of praise and words of\r\nprayer go up to heaven. The Christian home, though only a log-cabin, has\r\ntaken the place of the wigwam; and the poor, degraded Indian woman has\r\nbeen changed to the Christian wife and mother. With justice, personal\r\nrights, and the protection of law, the Gospel will do for our Red\r\nbrothers what it has done for other races—give to them homes, manhood\r\nand freedom.\r\n\r\n                                   H. B. WHIPPLE, _Bishop of Minnesota_.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _November 11th, 1880_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present number of Indians in the United States does not exceed three\r\nhundred thousand, but is possibly as large now as when the Europeans\r\nbegan the settlement of the North American continent. Different tribes\r\nthen existing have dwindled, and some have become extinct; but there is\r\nreason to believe that the vast territory now occupied by the United\r\nStates, if not then a howling wilderness, was largely an unpeopled\r\nsolitude. The roaming wild men who met the new discoverers were,\r\nhowever, numerous enough to make the Indian problem at the outset a\r\nserious one, while neither its gravity nor its difficulty yet shows\r\nsigns of diminution.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is not because the Indians are wild and savage men, for\r\nsuch men have in the past history of the human race been subdued and\r\ncivilized in unnumbered instances, while the changes which in our time\r\nhave been wrought among the cannibals of the South Sea and the\r\nbarbarians of South Africa, and among the wildest and most savage of the\r\nNorth American Indians themselves, show abundantly that the agencies of\r\ncivilization, ready to our hand are neither wanting nor weak.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty with the Indian problem is not with the Indian, but\r\nwith the Government and people of the United States. Instead of a\r\nliberal and far-sighted policy looking to the education and civilization\r\nand possible citizenship of the Indian tribes, we have suffered these\r\npeople to remain as savages, for whose future we have had no adequate\r\ncare, and to the consideration of whose present state the Government has\r\nonly been moved when pressed by some present danger. We have encroached\r\nupon their means of subsistence without furnishing them any proper\r\nreturn; we have shut them up on reservations often notoriously unfit for\r\nthem, or, if fit, we have not hesitated to drive them off for our\r\nprofit, without regard to theirs; we have treated them sometimes as\r\nforeign nations, with whom we have had treaties; sometimes as wards, who\r\nare entitled to no voice in the management of their affairs; and\r\nsometimes as subjects, from whom we have required obedience, but to whom\r\nwe have recognized no obligations. That the Government of the United\r\nStates, which has often plighted its faith to the Indian, and has broken\r\nit as often, and, while punishing him for his crimes, has given him no\r\nstatus in the courts except as a criminal, has been sadly derelict in\r\nits duty toward him, and has reaped the whirlwind only because it has\r\nsown the wind, is set forth in no exaggerated terms in the following\r\npages, and ought to be acknowledged with shame by every American\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nIt will be admitted now on every hand that the only solution of the\r\nIndian problem involves the entire change of these people from a savage\r\nto a civilized life. They are not likely to be exterminated. Unless we\r\nourselves withdraw from all contact with them, and leave them to roam\r\nuntrammeled over their wilds, or until the power of a Christian\r\ncivilization shall make them consciously one with us, they will not\r\ncease to vex us.\r\n\r\nBut how shall they become civilized? Civilization is in a most important\r\nsense a gift rather than an acquisition. Men do not gain it for\r\nthemselves, except as stimulated thereto by some incitement from above\r\nthemselves. The savage does not labor for the gratifications of\r\ncivilized life, since he does not desire these. His labors and his\r\ndesires are both dependent upon some spiritual gift, which, having\r\nkindled him, quickens his desires and calls forth his toil. Unless he\r\nhas some help from without, some light and life from above to illumine\r\nand inspire him, the savage remains a savage, and without this all the\r\nblandishments of the civilization with which he might be brought into\r\ncontact could no more win him into a better state than could all the\r\nlight and warmth of the sun woo a desert into a fruitful field. When\r\nEnglish missionaries went to the Indians in Canada, they took with them\r\nskilled laborers who should teach the Indians how to labor, and who, by\r\nproviding them at first with comfortable houses, and clothing, and food,\r\nshould awaken their desires and evoke their efforts to perpetuate and\r\nincrease these comforts. But the Indian would not work, and preferred\r\nhis wigwam, and skins, and raw flesh, and filth to the cleanliness and\r\nconveniences of a civilized home; and it was only as Christian\r\ninfluences taught him his inner need, and how this could be supplied,\r\nthat he was led to wish and work for the improvement of his outer\r\ncondition and habits of life. The same is true everywhere. Civilization\r\ndoes not reproduce itself. It must first be kindled, and can then only\r\nbe kept alive by a power genuinely Christian.\r\n\r\nBut it is idle to attempt to carry Christian influences to any one\r\nunless we are Christian. The first step, therefore, toward the desired\r\ntransformation of the Indian is a transformed treatment of him by\r\nourselves. In sober earnest, our Government needs, first of all, to be\r\nChristian, and to treat the Indian question as Christian principles\r\nrequire. This means at the outset that we should be honest, and not talk\r\nabout maintaining our rights until we are willing to fulfil our\r\nobligations. It means that we should be kind, and quite as eager to give\r\nthe Indian what is ours as to get what is his. It means that we should\r\nbe wise, and patient, and persevering, abandoning all makeshifts and\r\ntemporary expedients, and setting it before us as our fixed aim to act\r\ntoward him as a brother, until he shall act as a brother toward us.\r\nThere is no use to attempt to teach Christian duty to him in words till\r\nhe has first seen it exemplified in our own deeds.\r\n\r\nThe true Christian principle of self-forgetful honesty and kindness,\r\nclearly and continuously exhibited, is the first requisite of true\r\nstatesmanship in the treatment of the Indian question. This would not\r\nrequire, however, the immediate entrance of the Indian upon all the\r\nprivileges of citizenship and self-direction. Christianized though he\r\nmight be, he would need for a longer or shorter time guardianship like a\r\nchild. A wise care for his own interests could not be expected of him at\r\nthe outset, and the Government should care for him with wise\r\nforethought. Obedience to the law should be required of him, and the\r\nprotection of the law afforded him. The jurisdiction of the courts and\r\nthe presence of the Government should be felt in the Indian Territory\r\nand upon every Indian reservation as powerfully as in the most\r\nenlightened portions of the land. The court should go as early as the\r\nschool, if not before, and is itself an educational agency of\r\nincalculable importance.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indian, through wise and Christian treatment, becomes invested\r\nwith all the rights and duties of citizenship, his special tribal\r\nrelations will become extinct. This will not be easily nor rapidly done;\r\nbut all our policy should be shaped toward the gradual loosening of the\r\ntribal bond, and the gradual absorption of the Indian families among the\r\nmasses of our people. This would involve the bringing to an end of the\r\nwhole system of Indian reservations, and would forbid the continued\r\nisolation of the Indian Territory. It is not wise statesmanship to\r\ncreate impassable barriers between any parts of our country or any\r\nportions of our people.\r\n\r\nVery difficult questions demanding very careful treatment arise in\r\nreference to just this point. Certain Indian tribes now own certain\r\nIndian reservations and the Indian Territory, and this right of property\r\nought to be most sacredly guarded. But it does not, therefore, follow\r\nthat these Indians, in their present state, ought to control the present\r\nuse of this property. They may need a long training before they are wise\r\nenough to manage rightfully what is nevertheless rightfully their own.\r\nThis training, to which their property might fairly contribute means,\r\nshould assiduously be given in established schools with required\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\nIf the results thus indicated shall gradually come to pass, the property\r\nnow owned by the tribes should be ultimately divided and held in\r\nseveralty by the individual members of the tribes. Such a division\r\nshould not be immediately made, and, when made, it should be with great\r\ncare and faithfulness; but the Indian himself should, as soon as may be,\r\nfeel both the incentives and the restraints which an individual\r\nownership of property is fitted to excite, and the Government, which is\r\nhis guardian, having educated him for this ownership, should endow him\r\nwith it. But until the Indian becomes as able as is the average white\r\nman to manage his property for himself, the Government should manage it\r\nfor him, no matter whether he be willing or unwilling to have this done.\r\n\r\nA difficulty arises in the cases—of which there are many—where treaties\r\nhave been made by the Government of the United States with different\r\nIndian tribes, wherein the two parties have agreed to certain definitely\r\nnamed stipulations. Such treaties have proceeded upon the false\r\nview—false in principle, and equally false in fact—that an Indian tribe,\r\nroaming in the wilderness and living by hunting and plunder, is a\r\nnation. In order to be a nation, there must be a people with a code of\r\nlaws which they practise, and a government which they maintain. No vague\r\nsense of some unwritten law, to which human nature, in its lowest\r\nstages, doubtless feels some obligation, and no regulations\r\ninstinctively adopted for common defence, which the rudest people herded\r\ntogether will always follow, are enough to constitute a nation. These\r\nIndian tribes are not a nation, and nothing either in their history or\r\ntheir condition could properly invest them with a treaty-making power.\r\n\r\nAnd yet when exigencies have seemed to require, we have treated them as\r\nnations, and have pledged our own national faith in solemn covenant with\r\nthem. It were the baldest truism to say that this faith and covenant\r\nshould be fulfilled. Of course it should be fulfilled. It is to our own\r\nunspeakable disgrace that we have so often failed therein. But it\r\nbecomes us wisely and honestly to inquire whether the spirit of these\r\nagreements might not be falsified by their letter, and whether, in order\r\nto give the Indian his real rights, it may not be necessary to set aside\r\nprerogatives to which he might technically and formally lay claim. If\r\nthe Indian Territory and the Indian reservations have been given to\r\ncertain tribes as their possession forever, the sacredness of this\r\nguarantee should not shut our eyes to the sacredness also of the real\r\ninterests of the people in whose behalf the guarantee was given. We\r\nought not to lose the substance in our efforts to retain the shadow; we\r\nought not to insist upon the _summum jus_, when this would become the\r\n_summa injuria_.\r\n\r\nOf course the utmost caution is needed in the application of such a\r\nprinciple. To admit that a treaty with the Indians may be set aside\r\nwithout the consent of the Indians themselves, is to open the door again\r\nto the same frauds and falsehoods which have so darkly branded a\r\n\"Century of Dishonor.\" But our great trouble has been that we have\r\nsought to exact justice from the Indian while exhibiting no justice to\r\nhim; and when we shall manifest that all our procedure toward him is in\r\ntruth and uprightness, we need have no fear but that both his conscience\r\nand his judgment will in the end approve.\r\n\r\n                                                       JULIUS H. SEELYE.\r\n\r\nAMHERST COLLEGE, _December 10, 1880_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AUTHOR'S NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the quotations in this book, where the name of the authority is not\r\ncited, are from Official Reports of the War Department or the Department\r\nof the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe book gives, as its title indicates, only a sketch, and not a\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nTo write in full the history of any one of these Indian communities, of\r\nits forced migrations, wars, and miseries, would fill a volume by\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe history of the missionary labors of the different churches among the\r\nIndians would make another volume. It is the one bright spot on the dark\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nAll this I have been forced to leave untouched, in strict adherence to\r\nmy object, which has been simply to show our causes for national shame\r\nin the matter of our treatment of the Indians. It is a shame which the\r\nAmerican nation ought not to lie under, for the American people, as a\r\npeople, are not at heart unjust.\r\n\r\nIf there be one thing which they believe in more than any other, and\r\nmean that every man on this continent shall have, it is \"fair play.\" And\r\nas soon as they fairly understand how cruelly it has been denied to the\r\nIndian, they will rise up and demand it for him.\r\n\r\n                                                                   H. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         A CENTURY OF DISHONOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of the honorableness of the United States' dealings with\r\nthe Indians turns largely on a much disputed and little understood\r\npoint. What was the nature of the Indians' right to the country in which\r\nthey were living when the continent of North America was discovered?\r\nBetween the theory of some sentimentalists that the Indians were the\r\nreal owners of the soil, and the theory of some politicians that they\r\nhad no right of ownership whatever in it, there are innumerable grades\r\nand confusions of opinion. The only authority on the point must be the\r\nview and usage as accepted by the great discovering Powers at the time\r\nof discovery, and afterward in their disposition of the lands\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nFortunately, an honest examination of these points leaves no doubt on\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nEngland, France, Spain, little Portugal—all quarrelling fiercely, and\r\nfighting with each other for the biggest share in the new continent—each\r\nclaiming \"sovereignty of the soil\" by right of priority of discovery—all\r\nrecognized the Indians' \"right of occupancy\" as a right; a right\r\nalienable in but two ways, either by purchase or by conquest.\r\n\r\nAll their discussions as to boundaries, from 1603 down to 1776,\r\nrecognized this right and this principle. They reiterated, firstly, that\r\ndiscoverers had the right of sovereignty—a right in so far absolute that\r\nthe discoverer was empowered by it not only to take possession of, but\r\nto grant, sell, and convey lands still occupied by Indians—and that for\r\nany nation to attempt to take possession of, grant, sell, or convey any\r\nsuch Indian-occupied lands while said lands were claimed by other\r\nnations under the right of discovery, was an infringement of rights, and\r\njust occasion of war; secondly, that all this granting, selling,\r\nconveying was to be understood to be \"subject to the Indians' right of\r\noccupancy,\" which remained to be extinguished either through further\r\npurchase or through conquest by the grantee or purchaser.\r\n\r\nPeters, in his preface to the seventh volume of the \"United States\r\nStatutes at Large,\" says, \"The history of America, from its discovery to\r\nthe present day, proves the universal recognition of these principles.\"\r\n\r\nEach discovering Power might regulate the relations between herself and\r\nthe Indians; but as to the existence of the Indians' \"right of\r\noccupancy,\" there was absolute unanimity among them. That there should\r\nhave been unanimity regarding any one thing between them, is remarkable.\r\nIt is impossible for us to realize what a sudden invitation to greed and\r\ndiscord lay in this fair, beautiful, unclaimed continent—eight millions\r\nof square miles of land—more than twice the size of all Europe itself.\r\nWhat a lure to-day would such another new continent prove! The fighting\r\nover it would be as fierce now as the fighting was then, and the \"right\r\nof occupancy\" of the natives would stand small chance of such unanimous\r\nrecognition as the four Great Powers then justly gave it.\r\n\r\nOf the fairness of holding that ultimate sovereignty belonged to the\r\ncivilized discoverer, as against the savage barbarian, there is no\r\nmanner nor ground of doubt. To question this is feeble sentimentalism.\r\nBut to affirm and uphold this is not in any wise to overlook the lesser\r\nright which remained; as good, of its kind, and to its extent, as was\r\nthe greater right to which, in the just nature of things, it was bound\r\nto give way.\r\n\r\nIt being clear, then, that the Indians' \"right of occupancy\" was a right\r\nrecognized by all the great discovering Powers, acted upon by them in\r\nall their dispositions of lands here discovered, it remains next to\r\ninquire whether the United States Government, on taking its place among\r\nthe nations, also recognized or accepted this Indian \"right of\r\noccupancy\" as an actual right. Upon this point, also, there is no doubt.\r\n\r\n\"By the treaty which concluded the War of our Revolution, Great Britain\r\nrelinquished all claims not only to the government, but to the\r\nproprietary and territorial rights of the United States whose boundaries\r\nwere fixed in the second Article. By this treaty the powers of the\r\ngovernment and the right to soil which had previously been in Great\r\nBritain passed definitely to these States. We had before taken\r\npossession of them by declaring independence, but neither the\r\ndeclaration of independence nor the treaty confirming it could give us\r\nmore than that which we before possessed, or to which Great Britain was\r\nbefore entitled. It has never been doubted that either the United States\r\nor the several States had a clear title to all the lands within the\r\nboundary-lines described in the treaty, subject only to the Indian right\r\nof occupancy, and that the exclusive right to extinguish that right was\r\nvested in that government which might constitutionally exercise it.\"[1]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Peters, United States Statutes at Large, vol. vii.\r\n\r\n\"Subject to the Indian right of occupancy.\" It is noticeable how\r\nperpetually this phrase reappears. In their desire to define, assert,\r\nand enforce the greater right, the \"right of sovereignty,\" the makers,\r\ninterpreters, and recorders of law did not realize, probably, how\r\nclearly and equally they were defining, asserting, and enforcing the\r\nlesser right, the \"right of occupancy.\"\r\n\r\nProbably they did not so much as dream that a time would come when even\r\nthis lesser right—this least of all rights, it would seem, which could\r\nbe claimed by, or conceded to, an aboriginal inhabitant of a country,\r\nhowever savage—would be practically denied to our Indians. But if they\r\nhad foreseen such a time, they could hardly have left more explicit\r\ntestimony to meet the exigency.\r\n\r\n\"The United States have unequivocally acceded to that great and broad\r\nrule by which its civilized inhabitants now hold this country. They hold\r\nand assert in themselves the title by which it was acquired. They\r\nmaintain, as all others have maintained, that discovery gave an\r\nexclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of occupancy, either by\r\npurchase or conquest, and gave also a right to such a degree of\r\nsovereignty as the circumstances of the people would allow them to\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n\"The power now possessed by the United States to grant lands resided,\r\nwhile we were colonies, in the Crown or its grantees. The validity of\r\nthe titles given by either has never been questioned in our courts. It\r\nhas been exercised uniformly over territories in possession of the\r\nIndians. The existence of this power must negative the existence of any\r\nright which may conflict with and control it. An absolute title to lands\r\ncannot exist at the same time in different persons or in different\r\ngovernments. An absolute must be an exclusive title, or at least a title\r\nwhich excludes all others not compatible with it. All our institutions\r\nrecognize the absolute title of the Crown, subject only to the Indian\r\nright of occupancy, and recognize the absolute title of the Crown to\r\nextinguish the right. This is incompatible with an absolute and complete\r\ntitle in the Indians.\"[2]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Peters.\r\n\r\nCertainly. But it is also \"incompatible with an absolute and perfect\r\ntitle\" in the white man! Here again, in their desire to define and\r\nenforce the greater right, by making it so clear that it included the\r\nlesser one, they equally define and enforce the lesser right as a thing\r\nto be included. The word \"subject\" is a strong participle when it is\r\nused legally. Provisions are made in wills, \"subject to\" a widow's right\r\nof dower, for instance, and the provisions cannot be carried out without\r\nthe consent of the person to whom they are thus declared to be\r\n\"subject.\" A title which is pronounced to be \"subject to\" anything or\r\nanybody cannot be said to be absolute till that subjection is removed.\r\n\r\nThere have been some definitions and limitations by high legal authority\r\nof the methods in which this Indian \"right of occupancy\" might be\r\nextinguished even by conquest.\r\n\r\n\"The title by conquest is acquired and maintained by force. The\r\nconqueror prescribes its limits. Humanity, however, acting on public\r\nopinion, has established as a general rule that the conquered shall not\r\nbe wantonly oppressed, and that their condition shall remain as eligible\r\nas is compatible with the objects of the conquest. Usually they are\r\nincorporated with the victorious nation, and become subjects or citizens\r\nof the government with which they are connected. *** When this\r\nincorporation is practicable, humanity demands, and a wise policy\r\nrequires, that the rights of the conquered to property should remain\r\nunimpaired; that the new subjects should be governed as equitably as the\r\nold. *** When the conquest is complete, and the conquered inhabitants\r\ncan be blended with the conquerors, or safely governed as a distinct\r\npeople, public opinion, which not even the conqueror can disregard,\r\nimposes these restraints upon him, and he cannot neglect them without\r\ninjury to his fame, and hazard to his power.\"[3]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Peters, United States Statutes at Large, vol. vii.\r\n\r\nIn the sadly famous case of the removal of the Cherokee tribe from\r\nGeorgia, it is recorded as the opinion of our Supreme Court that \"the\r\nIndians are acknowledged to have an unquestionable, and heretofore\r\nunquestioned, right to the lands they occupy until that right shall be\r\nextinguished by a voluntary cession to the Government.\" *** \"The Indian\r\nnations have always been considered as distinct independent political\r\ncommunities, retaining their original natural rights as the undisputed\r\npossessors of the soil, from time immemorial, with the single exception\r\nof that imposed by irresistible power, which excluded them from\r\nintercourse with any other European potentate than the first discoverer\r\nof the coast of the particular region claimed; and this was a\r\nrestriction which those European potentates imposed on themselves as\r\nwell as on the Indians. The very term 'nation,' so generally applied to\r\nthem, means 'a people distinct from others.' The Constitution, by\r\ndeclaring treaties already made, as well as those to be made, to be the\r\nsupreme law of the land, has adopted and sanctioned the previous\r\ntreaties with the Indian nations, and consequently admits their rank\r\namong those powers who are capable of making treaties. The words\r\n'treaty' and 'nation' are words of our own language, selected in our\r\ndiplomatic and legislative proceedings by ourselves, having each a\r\ndefinite and well understood meaning. We have applied them to Indians as\r\nwe have applied them to other nations of the earth. They are applied to\r\nall in the same sense.\"[4]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Worcester _vs._ State of Georgia, 6 Peters, 515.\r\n\r\nIn another decision of the Supreme Court we find still greater emphasis\r\nput upon the Indian right of occupancy, by stating it as a right, the\r\nobservance of which was stipulated for in treaties between the United\r\nStates and other nations.\r\n\r\n\"When the United States acquired and took possession of the Floridas,\r\nthe treaties which had been made with the Indian tribes before the\r\nacquisition of the territory by Spain and Great Britain remained in\r\nforce over all the ceded territory, as the law which regulated the\r\nrelations with all the Indians who were parties to them, and were\r\nbinding on the United States by the obligation they had assumed by the\r\nLouisiana treaty as a supreme law of the land.\r\n\r\n\"The treaties with Spain and England before the acquisition of Florida\r\nby the United States, which guaranteed to the Seminole Indians their\r\nlands, according to the right of property with which they possessed\r\nthem, were adopted by the United States, who thus became the protectors\r\nof all the rights they (the Indians) had previously enjoyed, or could of\r\nright enjoy, under Great Britain or Spain, as individuals or nations, by\r\nany treaty to which the United States thus became parties in 1803. ***\r\n\r\n\"The Indian right to the lands as property was not merely of possession;\r\nthat of alienation was concomitant; both were equally secured,\r\nprotected, and guaranteed by Great Britain and Spain, subject only to\r\nratification and confirmation by the license, charter, or deed from the\r\ngovernment representing the king.\" ***\r\n\r\nThe laws made it necessary, when the Indians sold their lands, to have\r\nthe deeds presented to the governor for confirmation. The sales by the\r\nIndians transferred the kind of right which they possessed; the\r\nratification of the sale by the governor must be regarded as a\r\nrelinquishment of the title of the Crown to the purchaser, and no\r\ninstance is known of refusal of permission to sell, or of the rejection\r\nof an Indian sale.[5]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  United States _vs._ Clark, 9 Peters, 168.\r\n\r\n\"The colonial charters, a great portion of the individual grants by the\r\nproprietary and royal governments, and a still greater portion by the\r\nStates of the Union after the Revolution, were made for lands within the\r\nIndian hunting-grounds. North Carolina and Virginia, to a great extent,\r\npaid their officers and soldiers of the Revolutionary War by such\r\ngrants, and extinguished the arrears due the army by similar means. It\r\nwas one of the great resources which sustained the war, not only by\r\nthose States but by other States. The ultimate fee, encumbered with the\r\nright of occupancy, was in the Crown previous to the Revolution, and in\r\nthe States afterward, and subject to grant. This right of occupancy was\r\nprotected by the political power, and respected by the courts until\r\nextinguished.\" *** \"So the Supreme Court and the State courts have\r\nuniformly held.\"[6]\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Clark _vs._ Smith, 13 Peters.\r\n\r\nPresident Adams, in his Message of 1828, thus describes the policy of\r\nthe United States toward the Indians at that time:\r\n\r\n\"At the establishment of the Federal Government the principle was\r\nadopted of considering them as foreign and independent powers, and also\r\nas proprietors of lands. As independent powers, we negotiated with them\r\nby treaties; as proprietors, we purchased of them all the land which we\r\ncould prevail on them to sell; as brethren of the human race, rude and\r\nignorant, we endeavored to bring them to the knowledge of religion and\r\nletters.\"\r\n\r\nKent says: \"The European nations which, respectively, established\r\ncolonies in America, assumed the ultimate dominion to be in themselves,\r\nand claimed the exclusive right to grant a title to the soil, subject\r\nonly to the Indian right of occupancy. The natives were admitted to be\r\nthe rightful occupants of the soil, with a _legal_ as well as just claim\r\nto retain possession of it, and to use it according to their own\r\ndiscretion, though not to dispose of the soil at their own will, except\r\nto the government claiming the right of pre-emption.\" *** \"The United\r\nStates adopted the same principle; and their exclusive right to\r\nextinguish the Indian title by purchase or conquest, and to grant the\r\nsoil and exercise such a degree of sovereignty as circumstances\r\nrequired, has never been judicially questioned.\"\r\n\r\nKent also says, after giving the Supreme Court decision in the case of\r\nJohnson _vs._ M'Intosh: \"The same court has since been repeatedly called\r\nupon to discuss and decide great questions concerning Indian rights and\r\ntitle, and the subject has of late become exceedingly grave and\r\nmomentous, affecting the faith and the character, if not the\r\ntranquillity and safety, of the Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn Gardner's \"Institutes of International Law\" the respective rights to\r\nland of the Indians and the whites are thus summed up: \"In our Union the\r\naborigines had only a possessory title, and in the original thirteen\r\nStates each owned in fee, _subject to the Indian right_, all ungranted\r\nlands within their respective limits; and beyond the States the residue\r\nof the ungranted lands were vested in fee in the United States, _subject\r\nto the Indian possessory_ right, to the extent of the national limits.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Walker, in his \"American Law,\" makes a still briefer summary: \"The\r\nAmerican doctrine on the subject of Indian title is briefly this: The\r\nIndians have no fee in the lands they occupy. The fee is in the\r\nGovernment. They cannot, of course, aliene them either to nations or\r\nindividuals, the exclusive right of pre-emption being in the Government.\r\nYet they have a qualified right of occupancy which can only be\r\n_extinguished by treaty, and upon fair compensation_; until which they\r\nare entitled to be protected in their possession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Abbott's Digest,\" one of the very latest authorities, reiterates the\r\nsame principle: \"The right of occupancy has been recognized in countless\r\nways, among others by many decisions of courts and opinions of\r\nattorney-generals.\"\r\n\r\nIt being thus established that the Indian's \"right of occupancy\" in his\r\nlands was a right recognized by all the Great Powers discovering this\r\ncontinent, and accepted by them as a right necessary to be extinguished\r\neither by purchase or conquest, and that the United States, as a nation,\r\nhas also from the beginning recognized, accepted, and acted upon this\r\ntheory, it is next in order to inquire whether the United States has\r\ndealt honorably or dishonorably by the Indians in this matter of their\r\nrecognized \"right of occupancy.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the actions of individuals there is rarely much room for\r\ndiscussion whether they be honorable or dishonorable, the standard of\r\nhonor in men's conduct being, among the civilized, uniform, well\r\nunderstood, and undisputed. Stealing, for instance, is everywhere held\r\nto be dishonorable, as well as impolitic; lying, also, in all its forms;\r\nbreaking of promises and betrayals of trust are scorned even among the\r\nmost ignorant people. But when it comes to the discussion of the acts of\r\nnations, there seems to be less clearness of conception, less uniformity\r\nof standard of right and wrong, honor and dishonor. It is necessary,\r\ntherefore, in charging a government or nation with dishonorable conduct,\r\nto show that its moral standard ought in nowise to differ from the moral\r\nstandard of an individual; that what is cowardly, cruel, base in a man,\r\nis cowardly, cruel, base in a government or nation. To do this, it is\r\nonly needful to look into the history of the accepted \"Law of Nations,\"\r\nfrom the days of the Emperor Justinian until now.\r\n\r\nThe Roman jurisconsults employed as synonymous, says Wheaton, \"the two\r\nexpressions, 'jus gentium,' that law which is found among all the known\r\nnations of the earth, and 'jus naturale,' founded on the general nature\r\nof mankind; nevertheless, of these two forms of the same idea, the first\r\nought to be considered as predominant, since it as well as the 'jus\r\ncivile' was a positive law, the origin and development of which must be\r\nsought for in history.\"\r\n\r\nNations being simply, as Vattel defines them, \"societies of men united\r\ntogether,\" it is plain that, if there be such a thing as the \"law of\r\nnature,\" which men as individuals are bound to obey, that law is also\r\nobligatory on the \"societies\" made up of men thus \"united.\"\r\n\r\nHobbes divides the law of nature into that of man and that of States,\r\nsaying, \"The maxims of each of these laws are precisely the same; but as\r\nStates, once established, assume personal properties, that which is\r\ntermed the natural law when we speak of the duties of individuals is\r\ncalled the law of nations when applied to whole nations or States.\" The\r\nEmperor Justinian said, \"The law of nations is common to the whole human\r\nrace.\"\r\n\r\nGrotius draws the distinction between the law of nature and the law of\r\nnations thus: \"When several persons at different times and in various\r\nplaces maintain the same thing as certain, such coincidence of sentiment\r\nmust be attributed to some general cause. Now, in the questions before\r\nus, that cause must necessarily be one or the other of these two—either\r\na just consequence drawn from natural principles, or a universal\r\nconsent; the former discovers to us the law of nature, and the latter\r\nthe law of nations.\"\r\n\r\nVattel defines the \"necessary law of nations\" to be the \"application of\r\nthe law of nature to nations.\" He says: \"It is 'necessary,' because\r\nnations are absolutely bound to observe it. This law contains the\r\nprecepts prescribed by the law of nature to States, on whom that law is\r\nnot less obligatory than on individuals; since States are composed of\r\nmen, their resolutions are taken by men, and the law of nations is\r\nbinding on all men, under whatever relation they act. This is the law\r\nwhich Grotius, and those who follow him, call the Internal Law of\r\nNations, on account of its being obligatory on nations in the point of\r\nconscience.\"\r\n\r\nVattel says again: \"Nations being composed of men naturally free and\r\nindependent, and who before the establishment of civil societies lived\r\ntogether in the state of nature, nations or sovereign States are to be\r\nconsidered as so many free persons living together in the state of\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again: \"Since men are naturally equal, and a perfect equality\r\nprevails in their right and obligations as equally proceeding from\r\nnature, nations composed of men, and considered as so many free persons\r\nliving together in the state of nature, are naturally equal, and inherit\r\nfrom nature the same obligations and rights. Power or weakness does not\r\nin this respect produce any difference. A dwarf is as much a man as a\r\ngiant; a small republic no less a sovereign State than the most powerful\r\nkingdom.\"\r\n\r\nIn these two last sentences is touched the key-note of the true law of\r\nnations, as well as of the true law for individuals—justice. There is\r\namong some of the later writers on jurisprudence a certain fashion of\r\ncondescending speech in their quotations from Vattel. As years have gone\r\non, and States have grown more powerful, and their relations more\r\ncomplicated by reason of selfishness and riches, less and less has been\r\nsaid about the law of nature as a component and unalterable part of the\r\nlaw of nations. Fine subtleties of definition, of limitation have been\r\nattempted. Hundreds of pages are full of apparently learned\r\ndiscriminations between the parts of that law which are based on the law\r\nof nature and the parts which are based on the consent and usage of\r\nnations. But the two cannot be separated. No amount of legality of\r\nphrase can do away with the inalienable truth underlying it. Wheaton and\r\nPresident Woolsey to-day say, in effect, the same thing which Grotius\r\nsaid in 1615, and Vattel in 1758.\r\n\r\nSays Wheaton: \"International law, as understood among civilized nations,\r\nmay be defined as consisting of those rules of conduct which reason\r\ndeduces as consonant to justice from the nature of the society existing\r\namong independent nations.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Woolsey says: \"International law, in a wide and abstract\r\nsense, would embrace those rules of intercourse between nations which\r\nare deduced from their rights and moral claims; or, in other words, it\r\nis the expression of the jural and moral relations of States to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"If international law were not made up of rules for which reasons could\r\nbe given satisfactory to man's intellectual and moral nature, if it were\r\nnot built on principles of right, it would be even less of a science\r\nthan is the code which governs the actions of polite society.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the one fundamental right, of which the\r\n\"law of nations\" is at once the expression and the guardian, is the\r\nright of every nation to just treatment from other nations, the right of\r\neven the smallest republic equally with \"the most powerful kingdom.\"\r\nJust as the one fundamental right, of which civil law is the expression\r\nand guardian, is the right of each individual to just treatment from\r\nevery other individual: a right indefeasible, inalienable, in nowise\r\nlessened by weakness or strengthened by power—as majestic in the person\r\nof \"the dwarf\" as in that of \"the giant.\"\r\n\r\nOf justice, Vattel says: \"Justice is the basis of all society, the sure\r\nbond of all commerce. ***\r\n\r\n\"All nations are under a strict obligation to cultivate justice toward\r\neach other, to observe it scrupulously and carefully, to abstain from\r\nanything that may violate it. ***\r\n\r\n\"The right of refusing to submit to injustice, of resisting injustice by\r\nforce if necessary, is part of the law of nature, and as such recognized\r\nby the law of nations.\r\n\r\n\"In vain would Nature give us a right to refuse submitting to injustice,\r\nin vain would she oblige others to be just in their dealings with us, if\r\nwe could not lawfully make use of force when they refused to discharge\r\nthis duty. The just would lie at the mercy of avarice and injustice, and\r\nall their rights would soon become useless. From the foregoing right\r\narise, as two distinct branches, first, the right of a just defence,\r\nwhich belongs to every nation, or the right of making war against\r\nwhoever attacks her and her rights; and this is the foundation of\r\ndefensive war. Secondly, the right to obtain justice by force, if we\r\ncannot obtain it otherwise, or to pursue our right by force of arms.\r\nThis is the foundation of offensive war.\"\r\n\r\nJustice is pledged by men to each other by means of promises or\r\ncontracts; what promises and contracts are between men, treaties are\r\nbetween nations.\r\n\r\nPresident Woolsey says: \"A contract is one of the highest acts of human\r\nfree-will: it is the will binding itself in regard to the future, and\r\nsurrendering its right to change a certain expressed intention, so that\r\nit becomes, morally and jurally, a wrong to act otherwise.\r\n\r\n\"National contracts are even more solemn and sacred than private ones,\r\non account of the great interests involved; of the deliberateness with\r\nwhich the obligations are assumed; of the permanence and generality of\r\nthe obligations, measured by the national life, and including thousands\r\nof particular cases; and of each nation's calling, under God, to be a\r\nteacher of right to all, within and without its borders.\"\r\n\r\nVattel says: \"It is a settled point in natural law that he who has made\r\na promise to any one has conferred upon him a real right to require the\r\nthing promised; and, consequently, that the breach of a perfect promise\r\nis a violation of another person's right, and as evidently an act of\r\ninjustice as it would be to rob a man of his property. ***\r\n\r\n\"There would no longer be any security, no longer any commerce between\r\nmankind, if they did not think themselves obliged to keep faith with\r\neach other, and to perform their promises.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the whole weight of the recognized and accepted law\r\nof nations is thrown on the side of justice between nation and nation,\r\nand is the recognized and accepted standard of the obligation involved\r\nin compacts between nation and nation.\r\n\r\nWe must look, then, among the accepted declarations of the law of\r\nnations for the just and incontrovertible measure of the shame of\r\nbreaking national compacts, and of the wickedness of the nations that\r\ndare to do it.\r\n\r\nWe shall go back to the earliest days of the world, and find no dissent\r\nfrom, no qualification of the verdict of the infamy of such acts. Livy\r\nsays of leagues: \"Leagues are such agreements as are made by the command\r\nof the supreme power, and whereby the whole nation is made liable to the\r\nwrath of God if they infringe it.\"\r\n\r\nGrotius opens his \"Admonition,\" in conclusion of the third book of his\r\nfamous \"Rights of War and Peace,\" as follows: \"'For it is by faith,'\r\nsaith Cicero, 'that not commonwealths only, but that grand society of\r\nnations is maintained.' 'Take away this,' saith Aristotle, 'and all\r\nhuman commerce fails.' It is, therefore, an execrable thing to break\r\nfaith on which so many lives depend. 'It is,' saith Seneca, 'the best\r\nornament wherewith God hath beautified the rational soul; the strongest\r\nsupport of human society, which ought so much the more inviolably to be\r\nkept by sovereign princes by how much they may sin with greater license\r\nand impunity than other men. Wherefore take away faith, and men are more\r\nfierce and cruel than savage beasts, whose rage all men do horribly\r\ndread. Justice, indeed, in all other of her parts hath something that is\r\nobscure; but that whereunto we engage our faith is of itself clear and\r\nevident; yea, and to this very end do men pawn their faith, that in\r\ntheir negotiations one with another all doubts may be taken away, and\r\nevery scruple removed. How much more, then, doth it concern kings to\r\nkeep their faith inviolate, as well for conscience' sake as in regard to\r\ntheir honor and reputation, wherein consists the authority of a\r\nkingdom.'\"\r\n\r\nVattel says: \"Treaties are no better than empty words, if nations do not\r\nconsider them as respectable engagements, as rules which are to be\r\ninviolably observed by sovereigns, and held sacred throughout the whole\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\"The faith of treaties—that firm and sincere resolution, that invariable\r\nconstancy in fulfilling our engagements, of which we make profession in\r\na treaty—is therefore to be held sacred and inviolable between the\r\nnations of the earth, whose safety and repose it secures; and if mankind\r\nbe not wilfully deficient in their duty to themselves, infamy must ever\r\nbe the portion of him who violates his faith. ***\r\n\r\n\"He who violates his treaties, violates at the same time the law of\r\nnations, for he disregards the faith of treaties, that faith which the\r\nlaw of nations declares sacred; and, so far as dependent on him, he\r\nrenders it vain and ineffectual. Doubly guilty, he does an injury to his\r\nally, and he does an injury to all nations, and inflicts a wound on the\r\ngreat society of mankind. ***\r\n\r\n\"On the observance and execution of treaties,\" said a respectable\r\nsovereign, \"depends all the security which princes and States have with\r\nrespect to each other, and no dependence could henceforward be placed in\r\nfuture conventions if the existing ones were not to be observed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said, by those seeking to defend, or at least palliate,\r\nthe United States Government's repeated disregard of its treaties with\r\nthe Indians, that no Congress can be held responsible for the acts of\r\nthe Congress preceding it, or can bind the Congress following it; or, in\r\nother words, that each Congress may, if it chooses, undo all that has\r\nbeen done by previous Congresses. However true this may be of some\r\nlegislative acts, it is clearly not true, according to the principles of\r\ninternational law, of treaties.\r\n\r\nOn this point Vattel says: \"Since public treaties, even those of a\r\npersonal nature, concluded by a king, or by another sovereign who is\r\ninvested with sufficient power, are treaties of State, and obligatory on\r\nthe whole nation, real treaties, which were intended to subsist\r\nindependently of the person who has concluded them, are undoubtedly\r\nbinding on his successors; and the obligation which such treaties impose\r\non the State passes successively to all her rulers as soon as they\r\nassume the public authority. The case is the same with respect to the\r\nrights acquired by those treaties. They are acquired for the State, and\r\nsuccessively pass to her conductors.\"\r\n\r\nVon Martens says: \"Treaties, properly so called, are either personal or\r\nreal. They are personal when their continuation in force depends on the\r\nperson of the sovereign or his family, with whom they have been\r\ncontracted. They are real when their duration depends on the State,\r\nindependently of the person who contracts. Consequently, all treaties\r\nbetween republics must be real. All treaties made for a time specified\r\nor forever are real. ***\r\n\r\n\"This division is of the greatest importance, because real treaties\r\nnever cease to be obligatory, except in cases where all treaties become\r\ninvalid. Every successor to the sovereignty, in virtue of whatever title\r\nhe may succeed, is obliged to observe them without their being renewed\r\nat his accession.\"\r\n\r\nWheaton says: \"They (treaties) continue to bind the State, whatever\r\nintervening changes may take place in its internal constitution or in\r\nthe persons of its rulers. The State continues the same, notwithstanding\r\nsuch change, and consequently the treaty relating to national objects\r\nremains in force so long as the nation exists as an independent State.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no disagreement among authorities on this point. It is also\r\nsaid by some, seeking to defend or palliate the United States\r\nGovernment's continuous violations of its treaties with the Indians,\r\nthat the practice of all nations has been and is to abrogate a treaty\r\nwhenever it saw good reason for doing so. This is true; but the treaties\r\nhave been done away with in one of two ways, either by a mutual and\r\npeaceful agreement to that effect between the parties who had made\r\nit—the treaty being considered in force until the consent of both\r\nparties to its abrogation had been given—or by a distinct avowal on the\r\npart of one nation of its intention no longer to abide by it, and to\r\ntake, therefore, its chances of being made war upon in consequence.\r\nNeither of these courses has been pursued by the United States\r\nGovernment in its treaty-breaking with the Indians.\r\n\r\nVattel says, on the dissolution of treaties: \"Treaties may be dissolved\r\nby mutual consent at the free-will of the contracting powers.\"\r\n\r\nGrotius says: \"If either party violate the League, the other party is\r\nfreed; because each Article of the League hath the form and virtue of a\r\ncondition.\"\r\n\r\nKent says: \"The violation of any one article of a treaty is a violation\r\nof the whole treaty. ***\r\n\r\n\"It is a principle of universal jurisprudence that a compact cannot be\r\nrescinded by one party only, if the other party does not consent to\r\nrescind it, and does no act to destroy it. ***\r\n\r\n\"To recommence a war by breach of the articles of peace, is deemed much\r\nmore odious than to provoke a war by some new demand or aggression; for\r\nthe latter is simply injustice, but in the former case the party is\r\nguilty both of perfidy and injustice.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also said, with unanswerable irrelevancy, by some who seek to\r\ndefend or palliate the United States Government's continuous violation\r\nof its treaties with the Indians, that it was, in the first place,\r\nabsurd to make treaties with them at all, to consider them in any sense\r\nas treaty-making powers or nations. The logic of this assertion, made as\r\na justification for the breaking of several hundred treaties, concluded\r\nat different times during the last hundred years, and broken as fast as\r\nconcluded, seems almost equal to that of the celebrated defence in the\r\ncase of the kettle, which was cracked when it was lent, whole when\r\nreturned, and, in fact, was never borrowed at all. It would be a waste\r\nof words to reason with minds that can see in this position any shelter\r\nfor the United States Government against the accusation of perfidy in\r\nits treaty relations with the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe statement is undoubtedly a true one, that the Indians, having been\r\nplaced in the anomalous position as tribes, of \"domestic dependent\r\nnations,\" and as individuals, in the still more anomalous position of\r\nadult \"wards,\" have not legally possessed the treaty-making power. Our\r\nright to put them, or to consider them to be in those anomalous\r\npositions, might be successfully disputed; but they, helpless, having\r\naccepted such positions, did, no doubt, thereby lose their right to be\r\ntreated with as nations. Nevertheless, that is neither here nor there\r\nnow: as soon as our Government was established, it proceeded to treat\r\nwith them as nations by name and designation, and with precisely the\r\nsame forms and ratifications that it used in treating with other\r\nnations; and it continued to treat with them as nations by name and\r\ndesignation, and with continually increasing solemnity of asseveration\r\nof good intent and good faith, for nearly a century. The robbery, the\r\ncruelty which were done under the cloak of this hundred years of\r\ntreaty-making and treaty-breaking, are greater than can be told. Neither\r\nmountains nor deserts stayed them; it took two seas to set their bounds.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, Congress, either ashamed of making treaties only to break them,\r\nor grudging the time, money, and paper it wasted, passed an act to the\r\neffect that no Indian tribe should hereafter be considered as a foreign\r\nnation with whom the United States might contract by treaty. There seems\r\nto have been at the time, in the minds of the men who passed this act, a\r\ncertain shadowy sense of some obligation being involved in treaties; for\r\nthey added to the act a proviso that it should not be construed as\r\ninvalidating any treaties already made. But this sense of obligation\r\nmust have been as short-lived as shadowy, and could have had no element\r\nof shame in it, since they forthwith proceeded, unabashed, to negotiate\r\nstill more treaties with Indians, and break them; for instance, the\r\nso-called \"Brunot Treaty\" with the Ute Indians in Colorado, and one with\r\nthe Crow Indians in Montana—both made in the summer of 1873. They were\r\ncalled at the time \"conventions\" or \"agreements,\" and not \"treaties;\"\r\nbut the difference is only in name.\r\n\r\nThey stated, in a succession of numbered articles, promises of payment\r\nof moneys, and surrenders and cessions of land, by both parties; were to\r\nbe ratified by Congress before taking effect; and were understood by the\r\nIndians agreeing to them to be as binding as if they had been called\r\ntreaties. The fact that no man's sense of justice openly revolted\r\nagainst such subterfuges, under the name of agreements, is only to be\r\nexplained by the deterioration of the sense of honor in the nation. In\r\nthe days of Grotius there were men who failed to see dishonor in a trick\r\nif profit came of it, and of such he wrote in words whose truth might\r\nsting to-day as, no doubt, it stung then:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas there are many that think it superfluous to require that\r\njustice from a free people or their governors which they exact daily\r\nfrom private men, the ground of this error is this: because these men\r\nrespect nothing in the law but the profit that ariseth from it, which in\r\nprivate persons, being single and unable to defend themselves, is plain\r\nand evident; but for great cities, that seem to have within themselves\r\nall things necessary for their own well-being, it doth not so plainly\r\nappear that they have any need of that virtue called justice which\r\nrespects strangers.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts from unquestioned authorities on international law prove\r\nthat we may hold nations to standards of justice and good faith as we\r\nhold men; that the standards are the same in each case; and that a\r\nnation that steals and lies and breaks promises, will no more be\r\nrespected or unpunished than a man who steals and lies and breaks\r\npromises. It is possible to go still farther than this, and to show that\r\na nation habitually guilty of such conduct might properly be dealt with\r\ntherefore by other nations, by nations in no wise suffering on account\r\nof her bad faith, except as all nations suffer when the interests of\r\nhuman society are injured.\r\n\r\n\"The interest of human society,\" says Vattel, \"would authorize all the\r\nother nations to form a confederacy, in order to humble and chastise the\r\ndelinquent.\" *** When a nation \"regards no right as sacred, the safety\r\nof the human race requires that she should be repressed. To form and\r\nsupport an unjust pretension is not only doing an injury to the party\r\nwhose interests are affected by that pretension; but to despise justice\r\nin general is doing an injury to all nations.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the United States Government's repeated violations of\r\nfaith with the Indians thus convicts us, as a nation, not only of having\r\noutraged the principles of justice, which are the basis of international\r\nlaw; and of having laid ourselves open to the accusation of both cruelty\r\nand perfidy; but of having made ourselves liable to all punishments\r\nwhich follow upon such sins—to arbitrary punishment at the hands of any\r\ncivilized nation who might see fit to call us to account, and to that\r\nmore certain natural punishment which, sooner or later, as surely comes\r\nfrom evil-doing as harvests come from sown seed.\r\n\r\nTo prove all this it is only necessary to study the history of any one\r\nof the Indian tribes. I propose to give in the following chapters merely\r\noutline sketches of the history of a few of them, not entering more into\r\ndetails than is necessary to show the repeated broken faith of the\r\nUnited States Government toward them. A full history of the wrongs they\r\nhave suffered at the hands of the authorities, military and civil, and\r\nalso of the citizens of this country, it would take years to write and\r\nvolumes to hold.\r\n\r\nThere is but one hope of righting this wrong. It lies in appeal to the\r\nheart and the conscience of the American people. What the people demand,\r\nCongress will do. It has been—to our shame be it spoken—at the demand of\r\npart of the people that all these wrongs have been committed, these\r\ntreaties broken, these robberies done, by the Government.\r\n\r\nSo long as there remains on our frontier one square mile of land\r\noccupied by a weak and helpless owner, there will be a strong and\r\nunscrupulous frontiersman ready to seize it, and a weak and unscrupulous\r\npolitician, who can be hired for a vote or for money, to back him.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that can stay this is a mighty outspoken sentiment and\r\npurpose of the great body of the people. Right sentiment and right\r\npurpose in a Senator here and there, and a Representative here and\r\nthere, are little more than straws which make momentary eddies, but do\r\nnot obstruct the tide. The precedents of a century's unhindered and\r\nprofitable robbery have mounted up into a very Gibraltar of defence and\r\nshelter to those who care for nothing but safety and gain. That such\r\nprecedents should be held, and openly avowed as standards, is only one\r\nmore infamy added to the list. Were such logic employed in the case of\r\nan individual man, how quick would all men see its enormity. Suppose\r\nthat a man had had the misfortune to be born into a family whose name\r\nhad been blackened by generations of criminals; that his father, his\r\ngrandfather, and his great-grandfather before them had lived in prisons,\r\nand died on scaffolds, should that man say in his soul, \"Go to! What is\r\nthe use? I also will commit robbery and murder, and get the same gain by\r\nit which my family must have done?\" Or shall he say in his soul, \"God\r\nhelp me! I will do what may be within the power of one man, and the\r\ncompass of one generation, to atone for the wickedness, and to make\r\nclean the name of my dishonored house!\"\r\n\r\nWhat an opportunity for the Congress of 1880 to cover itself with a\r\nlustre of glory, as the first to cut short our nation's record of\r\ncruelties and perjuries! the first to attempt to redeem the name of the\r\nUnited States from the stain of a century of dishonor!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                             THE DELAWARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Hendrik Hudson anchored his ship, the _Half Moon_, off New York\r\nIsland in 1609, the Delawares stood in great numbers on the shore to\r\nreceive him, exclaiming, in their innocence, \"Behold! the gods have come\r\nto visit us!\"\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred years later, the traditions of this event were still\r\ncurrent in the tribe. The aged Moravian missionary, Heckewelder, writing\r\nin 1818, says:\r\n\r\n\"I at one time, in April, 1787, was astonished when I heard one of their\r\norators, a great chief of the Delawares, Pachgants-chilias by name, go\r\nover this ground, recapitulating the most extraordinary events which had\r\nbefore happened, and concluding in these words: 'I admit that there are\r\ngood white men, but they bear no proportion to the bad; the bad must be\r\nthe strongest, for they rule. They do what they please. They enslave\r\nthose who are not of their color, although created by the same Great\r\nSpirit who created them. They would make slaves of us if they could; but\r\nas they cannot do it, they kill us. There is no faith to be placed in\r\ntheir words. They are not like the Indians, who are only enemies while\r\nat war, and are friends in peace. They will say to an Indian, \"My\r\nfriend; my brother!\" They will take him by the hand, and, at the same\r\nmoment, destroy him. And so you' (he was addressing himself to the\r\nChristian Indians at Gnadenhütten, Pennsylvania) 'will also be treated\r\nby them before long. Remember that this day I have warned you to beware\r\nof such friends as these. I know the Long-knives. They are not to be\r\ntrusted.'\"\r\n\r\nThe original name of the Delawares was Lenni Lenape, or \"original\r\npeople.\" They were also called by the Western tribes Wapenachki, \"people\r\nat the rising of the sun.\" When the name \"Delawares\" was given to them\r\nby the whites, they at first resented it; but being told that they, and\r\nalso one of their rivers, were thus named after a great English\r\nbrave—Lord De la Warre—they were much pleased, and willingly took the\r\nname. Their lands stretched from the Hudson River to the Potomac. They\r\nwere a noble-spirited but gentle people; much under the control of the\r\narrogant and all-powerful Iroquois, who had put upon them the\r\ndegradation of being called \"women,\" and being forced to make war or\r\ngive up land at the pleasure of their masters.\r\n\r\nDuring William Penn's humane administration of the affairs of\r\nPennsylvania, the Delawares were his most devoted friends. They called\r\nhim Mignon, or Elder Brother.\r\n\r\n\"From his first arrival in their country,\" says Heckewelder, \"a\r\nfriendship was formed between them, which was to last as long as the sun\r\nshould shine, and the rivers flow with water. That friendship would\r\nundoubtedly have continued to the end of time, had their good brother\r\nalways remained among them.\"\r\n\r\nIn the French and Indian war of 1755 many of them fought on the side of\r\nthe French against the English; and in the beginning of our\r\nRevolutionary war the majority of them sided with the English against\r\nus.\r\n\r\nMost of the memorable Indian massacres which happened during this period\r\nwere the result of either French or English influence. Neither nation\r\nwas high-minded enough to scorn availing herself of savage allies to do\r\nbloody work which she would not have dared to risk national reputation\r\nby doing herself. This fact is too much overlooked in the habitual\r\nestimates of the barbarous ferocity of the Indian character as shown by\r\nthose early massacres.[7]\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Art. X.\r\n\r\nThe United States' first treaty with the Delawares was made in 1778, at\r\nFort Pitt. The parties to it were said to be \"the United States and the\r\nDelaware Nation.\" It stipulates that there shall be peace, and that the\r\ntroops of the United States may pass \"through the country of the\r\nDelaware Nation,\" upon paying the full value of any supplies they may\r\nuse. It further says that, \"Whereas the enemies of the United States\r\nhave endeavored by every artifice to possess the Indians with an opinion\r\nthat it is our design to extirpate them, and take possession of their\r\ncountry; to obviate such false suggestions, the United States guarantee\r\nto said nation of Delawares, and their heirs, all their territorial\r\nrights in the fullest and most ample manner as bounded by former\r\ntreaties.\"\r\n\r\nThe treaty also provides that, \"should it for the future be found\r\nconducive for the mutual interest of both parties to invite any other\r\ntribes who have been friends to the interests of the United States to\r\njoin the present confederation and form a State, whereof the Delaware\r\nNation shall be the head,\" it shall be done; and the Delawares shall be\r\nentitled to send a representative to Congress.[8]\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  It is superfluous to say that these provisions were never carried out.\r\n\r\nThe Delawares agreed to send all the warriors they could spare to fight\r\nfor us, and that there should be peace and perpetual friendship.\r\n\r\nAt this time the rest of the Ohio tribes, most of the New York tribes,\r\nand a large part of the Delawares were in arms on the British side. When\r\nthe war of the Revolution was concluded, they were all forced to make\r\npeace as best they could with us; and in our first treaty we provided\r\nfor the reinstating in the Delaware Nation of the chiefs and headmen who\r\nhad made that old alliance with us; they having lost caste in their\r\ntribe for having fought on our side.\r\n\r\n\"It is agreed,\" says the final Article of the treaty, \"that the Delaware\r\nchiefs, Kelelamand, or Lieut.-colonel Henry, Henque Pushees, or the Big\r\nCat, and Wicocalind, or Captain White Eyes, who took up the hatchet for\r\nthe United States, and their families, shall be received into the\r\nDelaware Nation in the same situation and rank as before the war, and\r\nenjoy their due portions of the lands given to the Wyandotte and\r\nDelaware nations in this treaty, as fully as if they had not taken part\r\nwith America, or as any other person or persons in the said nations.\"\r\n\r\nThis Captain White Eyes had adhered to our cause in spite of great\r\nopposition from the hostile part of the tribe. At one time he was\r\nthreatened with a violent death if he should dare to say one word for\r\nthe American cause; but by spirited harangues he succeeded in keeping\r\nthe enthusiasm of his own party centred around himself, and finally\r\ncarrying them over to the side of the United States. Some of his\r\nspeeches are on record, and are worthy to be remembered:\r\n\r\n\"If you will go out in this war,\" he said to them at one time, when the\r\nband were inclined to join the British, \"you shall not go without me. I\r\nhave taken peace measures, it is true, with the view of saving my tribe\r\nfrom destruction; but if you think me in the wrong, if you give more\r\ncredit to runaway vagabonds than to your own friends—to a man, to a\r\nwarrior, to a Delaware—if you insist on fighting the Americans—go! and I\r\nwill go with you. And I will not go like the bear-hunter, who sets his\r\ndogs on the animal to be beaten about with his paws, while he keeps\r\nhimself at a safe distance. No; I will lead you on; I will place myself\r\nin the front; I will fall with the first of you! You can do as you\r\nchoose; but as for me, I will not survive my nation. I will not live to\r\nbewail the miserable destruction of a brave people, who deserved, as you\r\ndo, a better fate.\"\r\n\r\nWere there many speeches made by commanders to their troops in those\r\nrevolutionary days with which these words do not compare favorably?\r\n\r\nThis treaty, by which our faithful ally, Wicocalind, was reinstated in\r\nhis tribal rank, was made at Fort M'Intosh in 1785. The Wyandottes,\r\nChippewas, and Ottawas, as well as the Delawares, joined in it. They\r\nacknowledged themselves and all their tribes to be \"under the protection\r\nof the United States, and of no other sovereign whatsoever.\" The United\r\nStates Government reserved \"the post of Detroit\" and an outlying\r\ndistrict around it; also, the post at Michilimackinac, with a\r\nsurrounding district of twelve miles square, and some other reserves for\r\ntrading-posts.\r\n\r\nThe Indians' lands were comprised within lines partly indicated by the\r\nCuyahoga, Big Miami, and Ohio rivers and their branches; it fronted on\r\nLake Erie; and if \"any citizen of the United States,\" or \"any other\r\nperson not an Indian,\" attempted \"to settle on any of the lands allotted\r\nto the Delaware and Wyandotte nations in this treaty\"—the fifth Article\r\nof the treaty said—\"the Indians may punish him as they please.\"\r\n\r\nMichigan, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, all are largely made up of the\r\nlands which were by this first treaty given to the Indians.\r\n\r\nFive years later, by another treaty at Fort Harmar, the provisions of\r\nthis treaty were reiterated, the boundaries somewhat changed and more\r\naccurately defined. The privilege of hunting on all the lands reserved\r\nto the United States was promised to the Indians \"without hinderance or\r\nmolestation, so long as they behaved themselves peaceably;\" and \"that\r\nnothing may interrupt the peace and harmony now established between the\r\nUnited States and the aforesaid nations,\" it was promised in one of the\r\narticles that white men committing offences or murders on Indians should\r\nbe punished in the same way as Indians committing such offences.\r\n\r\nThe year before this treaty Congress had resolved that \"the sum of\r\n$20,000, in addition to the $14,000 already appropriated, be\r\nappropriated for defraying the expenses of the treaties which have been\r\nordered, or which may be ordered to be held, in the present year, with\r\nthe several Indian tribes in the Northern Department; and for\r\nextinguishing the Indian claims, the whole of the said $20,000, together\r\nwith $6,000 of the said $14,000, to be applied solely to the purpose of\r\nextinguishing Indian claims to the lands they have already ceded to the\r\nUnited States by obtaining regular conveyances for the same, and for\r\nextending a purchase beyond the limits hitherto fixed by treaty.\"\r\n\r\nHere is one of the earliest records of the principle and method on which\r\nthe United States Government first began its dealings with Indians.\r\n\"Regular conveyances,\" \"extinguishing claims\" by \"extending purchase.\"\r\nThese are all the strictest of legal terms, and admit of no double\r\ninterpretations.\r\n\r\nThe Indians had been much dissatisfied ever since the first treaties\r\nwere made. They claimed that they had been made by a few only,\r\nrepresenting a part of the tribe; and, in 1786, they had held a great\r\ncouncil on the banks of the Detroit River, and sent a message to\r\nCongress, of which the following extracts will show the spirit.\r\n\r\nThey said: \"It is now more than three years since peace was made between\r\nthe King of Great Britain and you; but we, the Indians, were\r\ndisappointed, finding ourselves not included in that peace according to\r\nour expectations, for we thought that its conclusion would have promoted\r\na friendship between the United States and the Indians, and that we\r\nmight enjoy that happiness that formerly subsisted between us and our\r\nElder Brethren. We have received two very agreeable messages from the\r\nThirteen United States. We also received a message from the king, whose\r\nwar we were engaged in, desiring us to remain quiet, which we\r\naccordingly complied with. During this time of tranquillity we were\r\ndeliberating the best method we could to form a lasting reconciliation\r\nwith the Thirteen United States. *** We are still of the same opinion as\r\nto the means which may tend to reconcile us to each other; and we are\r\nsorry to find, although we had the best thoughts in our minds during the\r\nbefore-mentioned period, mischief has nevertheless happened between you\r\nand us. We are still anxious of putting our plan of accommodation into\r\nexecution, and we shall briefly inform you of the means that seem most\r\nprobable to us of effecting a firm and lasting peace and reconciliation,\r\nthe first step toward which should, in our opinion, be that all treaties\r\ncarried on with the United States on our parts should be with the\r\ngeneral will of the whole confederacy, and carried on in the most open\r\nmanner, without any restraint on either side; and especially as landed\r\nmatters are often the subject of our councils with you—a matter of the\r\ngreatest importance and of general concern to us—in this case we hold it\r\nindisputably necessary that any cession of our lands should be made in\r\nthe most public manner, and by the united voice of the confederacy,\r\nholding all partial treaties as void and of no effect. *** We say, let\r\nus meet half-way, and let us pursue such steps as become upright and\r\nhonest men. We beg that you will prevent your surveyors and other people\r\nfrom coming upon our side of the Ohio River.\"\r\n\r\nThese are touching words, when we remember that only the year before the\r\nUnited States had expressly told these Indians that if any white\r\ncitizens attempted to settle on their lands they might \"punish them as\r\nthey pleased.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have told you before we wished to pursue just steps, and we are\r\ndetermined they shall appear just and reasonable in the eyes of the\r\nworld. This is the determination of all the chiefs of our confederacy\r\nnow assembled here, notwithstanding the accidents that have happened in\r\nour villages, even when in council, where several innocent chiefs were\r\nkilled when absolutely engaged in promoting a peace with you, the\r\nThirteen United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe next year the President instructed the governor of the territory\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio to \"examine carefully into the real temper of the\r\nIndian tribes\" in his department, and says: \"The treaties which have\r\nbeen made may be examined, but must not be departed from, unless a\r\nchange of boundary beneficial to the United States can be obtained.\" He\r\nsays also: \"You will not neglect any opportunity that may offer of\r\nextinguishing the Indian rights to the westward, _as far as the\r\nMississippi_.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond that river even the wildest dream of greed did not at that time\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nThe President adds, moreover: \"You may stipulate that any white persons\r\ngoing over the said boundaries without a license from the proper\r\nofficers of the United States may be treated in such manner as the\r\nIndians may see fit.\"\r\n\r\nI have not yet seen, in any accounts of the Indian hostilities on the\r\nNorth-western frontier during this period, any reference to those\r\nrepeated permissions given by the United States to the Indians, to\r\ndefend their lands as they saw fit. Probably the greater number of the\r\npioneer settlers were as ignorant of these provisions in Indian treaties\r\nas are the greater number of American citizens to-day, who are honestly\r\nunaware—and being unaware, are therefore incredulous—that the Indians\r\nhad either provocation or right to kill intruders on their lands.\r\n\r\nAt this time separate treaties were made with the Six Nations, and the\r\ngovernor says that these treaties were made separately because of the\r\njealousy and hostility existing between them and the Delawares,\r\nWyandottes, etc., which he is \"not willing to lessen,\" because it\r\nweakens their power. \"Indeed,\" he frankly adds, \"it would not be very\r\ndifficult, if circumstances required it, to set them at deadly\r\nvariance.\"\r\n\r\nThus early in our history was the ingenious plan evolved of first\r\nmaddening the Indians into war, and then falling upon them with\r\nexterminating punishment. The gentleman who has left on the official\r\nrecords of his country his claim to the first suggestion and\r\nrecommendation of this method is \"Arthur St. Clair, governor of the\r\nterritory of the United States northwest of the Ohio River, and\r\ncommissioner plenipotentiary of the United States of America for\r\nremoving all causes of controversy, regulating trade, and settling\r\nboundaries with the Indian nations in the Northern Department.\"\r\n\r\nUnder all these conditions, it is not a matter of wonder that the\r\nfrontier was a scene of perpetual devastation and bloodshed; and that,\r\nyear by year, there grew stronger in the minds of the whites a terror\r\nand hatred of Indians; and in the minds of the Indians a stronger and\r\nstronger distrust and hatred of the whites.\r\n\r\nThe Delawares were, through the earlier part of these troubled times,\r\nfriendly. In 1791 we find the Secretary of War recommending the\r\ncommissioners sent to treat with the hostile Miamis and Wabash Indians\r\nto stop by the way with the friendly Delawares, and take some of their\r\nleading chiefs with them as allies. He says, \"these tribes are our\r\nfriends,\" and, as far as is known, \"the treaties have been well observed\r\nby them.\"\r\n\r\nBut in 1792 we find them mentioned among the hostile tribes to whom was\r\nsent a message from the United States Government, containing the\r\nfollowing extraordinary paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\"Brethren: The President of the United States entertains the opinion\r\nthat the war which exists is an error and mistake on your parts. That\r\nyou believe the United States want to deprive you of your lands, and\r\ndrive you out of the country. _Be assured that this is not so_; on the\r\ncontrary, that we should be greatly gratified with the opportunity of\r\nimparting to you all the blessings of civilized life; of teaching you to\r\ncultivate the earth, and raise corn; to raise oxen, sheep, and other\r\ndomestic animals; to build comfortable houses; and to educate your\r\nchildren so as ever to dwell upon the land.\r\n\r\n\"Consult, therefore, upon the great object of peace; call in your\r\nparties, and enjoin a cessation of all further depredations; and as many\r\nof the principal chiefs as shall choose repair to Philadelphia, the seat\r\nof the Great Government, and there make a peace founded on the\r\nprinciples of justice and humanity. _Remember that no additional lands\r\nwill be required of you, or any other tribe, to those that have been\r\nceded by former treaties._\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this same year, also, that General Putnam said to them, in a\r\nspeech at Post Vincennes: \"The United States don't mean to wrong you out\r\nof your lands. They don't want to take away your lands by force. They\r\nwant to do you justice.\" And the venerable missionary, Heckewelder, who\r\nhad journeyed all the way from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to try to help\r\nbring about peace, said to them, \"The great chief who has spoken to you\r\nis a good man. He loves you, and will always speak the truth to you. I\r\nwish you to listen to his words, and do as he desires you.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1793 a great council was held, to which came the chiefs and headmen\r\nof the Delawares, and of twelve other tribes, to meet commissioners of\r\nthe United States, for one last effort to settle the vexed boundary\r\nquestion. The records of this council are profoundly touching. The\r\nIndians reiterated over and over the provisions of the old treaties\r\nwhich had established the Ohio River as one of their boundaries. Their\r\nwords were not the words of ignorant barbarians, clumsily and doggedly\r\nholding to a point; they were the words of clear-headed, statesman-like\r\nrulers, insisting on the rights of their nations. As the days went on,\r\nand it became more and more clear that the United States commissioners\r\nwould not agree to the establishment of the boundary for which the\r\nIndians contended, the speeches of the chiefs grow sadder and sadder.\r\nFinally, in desperation, as a last hope, they propose to the\r\ncommissioners that all the money which the United States offers to pay\r\nto them for their lands shall be given to the white settlers to induce\r\nthem to move away. They say:\r\n\r\n\"Money to us is of no value, and to most of us unknown; and as no\r\nconsideration whatever can induce us to sell the lands on which we get\r\nsustenance for our women and children, we hope we may be allowed to\r\npoint out a mode by which your settlers may be easily removed, and peace\r\nthereby obtained.\r\n\r\n\"We know that these settlers are poor, or they would never have ventured\r\nto live in a country which has been in continual trouble ever since they\r\ncrossed the Ohio. Divide, therefore, this large sum of money which you\r\nhave offered us among these people; give to each, also, a proportion of\r\nwhat you say you would give to us annually, over and above this very\r\nlarge sum of money, and we are persuaded they would most readily accept\r\nof it in lieu of the lands you sold them. If you add, also, the great\r\nsums you must expend in raising and paying armies with a view to force\r\nus to yield you our country, you will certainly have more than\r\nsufficient for the purpose of repaying these settlers for all their\r\nlabor and their improvements.\r\n\r\n\"You have talked to us about concessions. It appears strange that you\r\nshould expect any from us, who have only been defending our just rights\r\nagainst your invasions. We want peace. Restore to us our country, and we\r\nshall be enemies no longer.\r\n\r\n\"*** We desire you to consider, brothers, that our only demand is the\r\npeaceable possession of a small part of our once great country. Look\r\nback and review the lands from whence we have been driven to this spot.\r\nWe can retreat no farther, because the country behind hardly affords\r\nfood for its present inhabitants, and we have therefore resolved to\r\nleave our bones in this small space to which we are now confined.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners replied that to make the Ohio River the boundary was\r\nnow impossible; that they sincerely regretted that peace could not be\r\nmade; but, \"knowing the upright and liberal views of the United States,\"\r\nthey trust that \"impartial judges will not attribute the continuance of\r\nthe war to them.\"\r\n\r\nNotice was sent to the governor that the Indians \"refused to make\r\npeace;\" and General Anthony Wayne, a few weeks later, wrote to the\r\nSecretary of War, \"The safety of the Western frontiers, the reputation\r\nof the legion, the dignity and interest of the nation—all forbid a\r\nretrograde manœuvre, or giving up one inch of ground we now possess,\r\ntill the enemy are compelled to sue for peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the campaigns that followed is to be found in many\r\nvolumes treating of the pioneer life of Ohio and other North-western\r\nStates. One letter of General Wayne's to the Secretary of War, in\r\nAugust, 1794, contains a paragraph which is interesting, as showing the\r\nhabits and method of life of the people whom we at this time, by force\r\nof arms, drove out from their homes—homes which we had only a few years\r\nbefore solemnly guaranteed to them, even giving them permission to\r\npunish any white intruders there as they saw fit. By a feint of\r\napproaching Grand Glaize through the Miami villages, General Wayne\r\nsurprised the settlement, and the Indians, being warned by a deserter,\r\nhad barely time to flee for their lives. What General Wayne had intended\r\nto do may be inferred from this sentence in his letter: \"I have good\r\ngrounds to conclude that the defection of this villain prevented the\r\nenemy from receiving a fatal blow at this place when least expected.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, he consoles himself by the fact that he has \"gained possession\r\nof the grand emporium of the hostile Indians of the West without loss of\r\nblood. The very extensive and highly cultivated fields and gardens show\r\nthe work of many hands. The margins of those beautiful rivers—the\r\nMiamis, of the Lake, and Au Glaize—appear like one continued village for\r\na number of miles, both above and below this place; nor have I ever\r\nbefore beheld such immense fields of corn in any part of America, from\r\nCanada to Florida.\"\r\n\r\nAll these villages were burnt, and all these cornfields destroyed; the\r\nIndians were followed up and defeated in a sharp fight. The British\r\nagents did their best to keep them hostile, and no inconsiderable aid\r\nwas furnished to them from Canada. But after a winter of suffering and\r\nhunger, and great vacillations of purpose, they finally decided to yield\r\nto the inevitable, and in the summer of 1795 they are to be found once\r\nmore assembled in council, for the purpose of making a treaty; once more\r\nto be told by the representatives of the United States Government that\r\n\"the heart of General Washington, the Great Chief of America, wishes for\r\nnothing so much as peace and brotherly love;\" that \"such is the justice\r\nand liberality of the United States,\" that they will now a third time\r\npay for lands; and that they are \"acting the part of a tender father to\r\nthem and their children in thus providing for them not only at present,\r\nbut forever.\"\r\n\r\nEleven hundred and thirty Indians (eleven tribes, besides the Delawares,\r\nbeing represented) were parties to this treaty. By this treaty nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of the present State of Ohio were ceded to the United States;\r\nand, in consideration of these \"cessions and relinquishments, and to\r\nmanifest the liberality of the United States as the great means of\r\nrendering this peace strong and perpetual,\" the United States\r\nrelinquished all claims \"to all other Indian lands northward of the\r\nRiver Ohio, eastward of the Mississippi, and westward and southward of\r\nthe Great Lakes and the waters uniting them, according to the boundary\r\nline agreed upon by the United States and the King of Great Britain, in\r\nthe treaty of peace made between them in the year 1783,\" with the\r\nexception of four tracts of land. But it was stated to the Indians that\r\nthese reservations were not made \"to annoy or impose the smallest degree\r\nof restraint on them in the quiet enjoyment and full possession of their\r\nlands,\" but simply to \"connect the settlements of the people of the\r\nUnited States,\" and \"to prove convenient and advantageous to the\r\ndifferent tribes of Indians residing and hunting in their vicinity.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifth Article of the treaty is: \"To prevent any misunderstanding\r\nabout the Indian lands now relinquished by the United States, it is\r\nexplicitly declared that the meaning of that relinquishment is this:\r\nthat the Indian tribes who have a right to those lands are quietly to\r\nenjoy them—hunting, planting, and dwelling thereon _so long as they\r\nplease_ without any molestation from the United States; but when those\r\ntribes, or any of them, shall be disposed to sell their lands, or any\r\npart of them, they are to be sold only to the United States; and until\r\nsuch sale the United States will protect all the said Indian tribes in\r\nthe quiet enjoyment of their lands against all citizens of the United\r\nStates, and against all other white persons who intrude on the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe sixth Article reiterates the old pledge, proved by the last three\r\nyears to be so worthless—that, \"If any citizen of the United States, or\r\nany other white person or persons, shall presume to settle upon the\r\nlands now relinquished by the United States, such citizen or other\r\nperson shall be out of the protection of the United States; and the\r\nIndian tribe on whose land the settlement may be made may drive off the\r\nsettler, or punish him in such manner as they shall think fit.\"\r\n\r\nThe seventh Article gives the Indians the liberty \"to hunt within the\r\nterritory and lands which they have now ceded to the United States,\r\nwithout hinderance or molestation, so long as they demean themselves\r\npeaceably.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States agreed to pay to the Indians twenty thousand dollars'\r\nworth of goods at once; and \"henceforward, every year, forever, useful\r\ngoods to the value of nine thousand five hundred dollars.\" Peace was\r\ndeclared to be \"established\" and \"perpetual.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne told the Indians that they might believe him, for he had\r\nnever, \"in a public capacity, told a lie;\" and one of the Indians said,\r\nwith much more dignity, \"The Great Spirit above hears us, and I trust we\r\nshall not endeavor to deceive each other.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1813, by a treaty at Vincennes, the bounds of the reservation of the\r\nPost of St. Vincennes were defined, and the Indians, \"as a mark of their\r\nregard and attachment to the United States, relinquished to the United\r\nStates the great salt spring on the Saline Creek.\"\r\n\r\nIn less than a year we made still another treaty with them for the\r\nextinguishment of their title to a tract of land between the Ohio and\r\nthe Wabash rivers (which they sold to us for a ten years' annuity of\r\nthree hundred dollars, which was to be \"exclusively appropriated to\r\nameliorating their condition and promoting their civilization\"); and in\r\none year more still another treaty, in which a still further cession of\r\nland was made for a permanent annuity of one thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nIn August of this year General Harrison writes to the Secretary of War\r\nthat there are great dissensions between the Delawares and Miamis in\r\nregard to some of the ceded lands, the Miamis claiming that they had\r\nnever consented to give them up. General Harrison observes the most\r\nexact neutrality in this matter, but says, \"A knowledge of the value of\r\nland is fast gaining ground among the Indians,\" and negotiations are\r\nbecoming in consequence much more difficult. In the course of this\r\ncontroversy, \"one of the chiefs has said that he knew a great part of\r\nthe land was worth six dollars an acre.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only ten years since one of the chiefs of these same tribes had\r\nsaid, \"Money is to us of no value.\" However, they must be yet very far\r\nfrom having reached any true estimate of real values, as General\r\nHarrison adds: \"From the best calculation I have been able to make, the\r\ntract now ceded contains at least two millions of acres, and embraces\r\nsome of the finest lands in the Western country.\"\r\n\r\nCheap at one thousand dollars a year!—even with the negro man thrown in,\r\nwhich General Harrison tells the Secretary he has ordered Captain Wells\r\nto purchase, and present to the chief, The Turtle, and to draw on the\r\nUnited States Treasury for the amount paid for him.\r\n\r\nFour years later (1809) General Harrison is instructed by the President\r\n\"to take advantage of the most favorable moment for extinguishing the\r\nIndian title to the lands lying east of the Wabash, and adjoining\r\nsouth;\" and the title was extinguished by the treaty of Fort Wayne—a\r\nlittle more money paid, and a great deal of land given up.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 we made a treaty, simply of peace and friendship, with the\r\nDelawares and several other tribes: they agreeing to fight faithfully on\r\nour side against the English, and we agreeing to \"confirm and establish\r\nall the boundaries\" as they had existed before the war.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 it was deemed advisable to make an effort to \"extinguish the\r\nIndian title to all the lands claimed by them within the limits of the\r\nState of Ohio\". Two commissioners were appointed, with great\r\ndiscretionary powers; and a treaty was concluded early in the autumn, by\r\nwhich there was ceded to the United States nearly all the land to which\r\nthe Indians had claim in Ohio, a part of Indiana, and a part of\r\nMichigan. This treaty was said by the Secretary of War to be \"the most\r\nimportant of any hitherto made with the Indians.\" \"The extent of the\r\ncession far exceeded\" his most sanguine expectations, and he had the\r\nhonesty to admit that \"there can be no real or well-founded objection to\r\nthe amount of the compensation given for it, except that it is not an\r\nadequate one.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners who negotiated the treaty were apprehensive that they\r\nwould be accused of having made too liberal terms with the Indians, and\r\nin their report to the department they enumerate apologetically the\r\nreasons which made it impossible for them to get the land cheaper. Mr.\r\nCass says of the terms: \"Under any circumstances, they will fall\r\ninfinitely short of the pecuniary and political value of the country\r\nobtained.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians, parties to this treaty, surrendered by it almost the last\r\nof their hunting-grounds, and would soon be driven to depending wholly\r\nupon the cultivation of the soil.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 the Delawares again ceded land to the United States—ceded all to\r\nwhich they laid claim in the State of Indiana—and the United States\r\npromised to provide for them \"a country to reside in on the west side of\r\nthe Mississippi,\" and \"to guarantee to them the peaceable possession\" of\r\nthe same. They were to have four thousand dollars a year in addition to\r\nall the sums promised by previous treaties, and they were to be allowed\r\nto remain three years longer by sufferance in their present homes. The\r\nGovernment also agreed to pay them for their improvements on their\r\nlands, to give them a hundred and twenty horses, and a \"sufficient\r\nnumber of pirogues to aid in transporting them to the west side of the\r\nMississippi;\" also provisions for the journey.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 a supplementary Article was added to this treaty. The United\r\nStates Government began to show traces of compunction and pity. The\r\nArticle says, \"Whereas the Delaware Nation are now willing to remove,\"\r\nit is agreed upon that the country in the fork of the Kansas and\r\nMissouri rivers, selected for their home, \"shall be conveyed and forever\r\nsecured by the United States to the said Delaware Nation, as their\r\npermanent residence; and the United States hereby pledges the faith of\r\nthe Government to guarantee to the said Delaware Nation, forever, the\r\nquiet and peaceable and undisturbed enjoyment of the same against the\r\nclaims and assaults of all and every other people whatever.\"\r\n\r\nAn additional permanent annuity of one thousand dollars is promised;\r\nforty horses, \"and the use of six wagons and ox-teams to assist in\r\nremoving heavy articles,\" provisions for the journey, and one year's\r\nsubsistence after they reach their new home; also the erection of a\r\ngrist and saw mill within two years.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 the Secretary of War congratulated the country on the fact that\r\n\"the country north of the Ohio, east of the Mississippi, including the\r\nStates of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and the Territory of Michigan as far\r\nas the Fox and Wisconsin rivers,\" has been practically \"cleared of the\r\nembarrassments of Indian relations,\" as there are not more than five\r\nthousand Indians, all told, left in this whole region.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the same year says that it is\r\n\"grateful to notice\" how much the Indians' condition is \"ameliorated\r\nunder the policy of removal.\" He says that they, \"protected by the\r\nstrong arm of the Government, and dwelling on lands _distinctly_ and\r\npermanently established as their own, enjoying a delightful climate and\r\na fertile soil, turn their attention to the cultivation of the earth,\r\nand abandon the chase for the surer supply of domestic animals.\"\r\n\r\nThis commissioner apparently does not remember, perhaps never read, the\r\nrecords of the great fields of corn which the Delawares had on the Miami\r\nRiver in 1795, and how they returned twice that summer and replanted\r\nthem, after General Wayne had cut down and burnt the young crops. They\r\nhad \"turned their attention to the cultivation of the soil\" forty years\r\nago, and that was what came of it. We shall see how much better worth\r\nwhile it may be for them to plant corn in their new \"permanent home,\"\r\nthan it was in their last one.\r\n\r\nThe printed records of Indian Affairs for the first forty years of this\r\ncentury are meagre and unsatisfactory. Had the practice prevailed then,\r\nas at the present time, of printing full annual reports for the\r\ndifferent tribes, it would be possible to know much which is now forever\r\nlocked up in the traditions and the memories of the Indians themselves.\r\nFor ten years after the making of this last quoted treaty, there is\r\nlittle official mention of the Delawares by name, beyond the mention in\r\nthe fiscal reports of the sums paid to them as annuities and for\r\neducation. In 1833 the commissioner says, \"The agent for the Delawares\r\nand Shawnees states that he was shown cloth that was spun and wove, and\r\nshirts and other clothing made by the Indian girls.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1838 the Delawares are reported as cultivating one thousand five\r\nhundred acres of land in grain and vegetables, and raising a great many\r\nhogs, cattle, and horses. \"They are a brave, enterprising people,\" and\r\n\"at peace with all neighboring Indians.\"\r\n\r\nParties of them frequently make excursions into the Rocky Mountains\r\nafter beaver, and return with a rich reward, sometimes as much as one\r\nthousand dollars to an individual; but their money is soon spent,\r\nchiefly for ardent spirits. The agent says: \"The only hinderance now in\r\nthe way of the Delawares, Shawnees, and Kickapoos is ardent spirits. ***\r\nThese whiskey traffickers, who seem void of all conscience, rob and\r\nmurder many of these Indians; I say rob—they will get them drunk, and\r\nthen take their horses, guns, or blankets off their backs, regardless of\r\nhow quick they may freeze to death; I say they murder—if not directly,\r\nindirectly, they furnish the weapon—they make them drunk, and, when\r\ndrunk, they kill their fellow-beings. Some freeze to death when drunk;\r\nseveral drunken Indians have been drowned in the Missouri River this\r\nseason, aiming to cross when drunk.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the chiefs of the Delawares met together, and prepared a\r\nremarkable document, which was forwarded to the Secretary of War. In\r\nthis paper they requested that all the school funds to which they were\r\nentitled by treaty provisions might be paid to the Indian Manual Labor\r\nSchool near the Fort Leavenworth Agency; might be pledged to that school\r\nfor ten years to come, and that they might therefor be guaranteed the\r\neducation and subsistence of Delaware children, not exceeding fifty at\r\nany one time. It came out, in course of this negotiation, that two\r\nthousand dollars were due them on arrearages of their school fund.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary acceded to this request, but imposed five conditions upon\r\nit, of which the fourth seems worth chronicling, as an indication of the\r\nhelplessness of the Delawares in the matter of the disposition of their\r\nown money: \"The interest to be paid annually when it may suit the\r\nTreasury; and this ratification to be subject to withdrawal, and the\r\nagreement itself to rescission, and to be annulled at the pleasure of\r\nthe Department.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1845 the Delawares \"raise a sufficiency to subsist on. The women do a\r\nlarge portion of the work on the farms. In many families, however, the\r\nwomen do not work on the farm. They raise corn, pumpkins, beans, pease,\r\ncabbages, potatoes, and many kinds of garden vegetables. Some few raise\r\nwheat and oats. They have lately had built, out of their own means, a\r\ngood saw and grist mill, with two run of stones, one for corn and the\r\nother for wheat. There is a constant stream, called the Stranger, in\r\ntheir country that affords excellent water privileges. On this stream\r\ntheir mills are built.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time they are waiting with much anxiety to see if their \"Great\r\nFather\" will punish the Sioux, who have at two different times attacked\r\nthem, and murdered in all some thirty men. \"They say they do not wish to\r\noffend and disobey their Great Father, and before they attempt to\r\nrevenge themselves they will wait and see if their Great Father will\r\ncompel the Sioux to make reparation.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1848 \"almost every family is well supplied with farming-stock; and\r\nthey have raised abundance of corn, some wheat, potatoes, oats, and\r\ngarden vegetables; have made butter and cheese; and raised fruit, etc.,\r\netc. They dwell in good log-cabins, and some have extremely neat houses,\r\nwell furnished. They have their outhouses, stables, well-fenced lots,\r\nand some have good barns.\" There are seventy scholars in one school\r\nalone that are taught by the Friends; and the teacher reports: \"It is\r\ntruly astonishing to see the rapidity with which they acquire knowledge.\r\nThe boys work on the farm part of the time, and soon learn how to do\r\nwhat they are set at. The girls spend a part of their time in doing\r\nhousework, sewing, etc. Many of them do the sewing of their own, and\r\nsome of the clothes of the other children.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1853 the Delawares are recorded as being \"among the most remarkable\r\nof our colonized tribes. By their intrepidity and varied enterprise they\r\nare distinguished in a high degree. Besides being industrious farmers\r\nand herdsmen, they hunt and trade all over the interior of the\r\ncontinent, carrying their traffic beyond the Great Salt Lake, and\r\nexposing themselves to a thousand perils.\"\r\n\r\nTheir agent gives, in his report for this year, a graphic account of an\r\nincident such as has only too often occurred on our frontier. \"A small\r\nparty of Delawares, consisting of a man, his squaw, and a lad about\r\neighteen years of age, recently returning from the mountains, with the\r\navails and profits of a successful hunt and traffic, after they had\r\ncommenced their journey homeward the second day the man sickened and\r\ndied. Before he died he directed his squaw and the young man to hasten\r\nhome with their horses and mules—thirteen in number—their money (four\r\nhundred and forty-five dollars), besides many other articles of value.\r\nAfter a few days' travel, near some of the forts on the Arkansas, they\r\nwere overtaken by four white men, deserters from the United States\r\nArmy—three on foot, and one riding a mule. The squaw and young man\r\nloaned each of the men on foot a horse or mule to ride, and furnished\r\nthem with provisions. They all travelled on friendly together for some\r\nsix or seven days, till they arrived at Cottonwood Creek, thirty-five or\r\nforty miles west of Council Grove. One evening, while resting, the young\r\nman was killed by these men; and the squaw was also supposed by these\r\nwretches to be dead, having had her throat cut badly and her head\r\nfractured. The two were then dragged off in the grass, supposed to be\r\ndead. The men gathered the mules, horses, money, guns, blankets—all that\r\nthey supposed of value—and made for Jackson County, Missouri, where they\r\ndisposed of the stock as best they could, and three of them took steamer\r\nfor St. Louis. The squaw, on the day after, resuscitated; and soon\r\ndiscovering that her companion had been killed, and everything they\r\npossessed had disappeared, she, in her feeble and dangerous condition,\r\ntook the road to Council Grove. The fifth day, she says, she was\r\novertaken by a Kaw Indian, and brought into Council Grove, where the\r\ntraders had every attention paid her, and sent a runner to the Delaware\r\ntraders and myself, and we soon succeeded in capturing one of the men in\r\nLiberty, Clay County, Missouri, where he confessed the whole tragedy—the\r\nmurder, robbing, etc. The three others had left for St. Louis. A\r\ntelegraphic despatch to St. Louis, however, had the desired effect, and\r\nthe three men were taken and brought back to Liberty, where, on trial\r\nbefore two justices of the peace, they were committed for trial in the\r\nDistrict Court of the United States for the State of Missouri. As feeble\r\nas the squaw was, I was under the necessity of having her taken to\r\nLiberty as a witness. She readily recognized and pointed out in a large\r\ncrowd of persons three of the prisoners. I have caused four of the\r\nrecovered mules and horses to be turned over to the unfortunate squaw. I\r\nexpect to recover two or three more; the balance, I am of opinion, will\r\nnever be obtained.\"\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Indian Commissioner for this year there is also a\r\nparagraph which should not be omitted from this sketch: \"The present\r\nseems to be an appropriate occasion for calling the attention of\r\nCongress to certain treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes which\r\nthe Government, for a number of years, has failed to execute. In\r\nconsideration of the cession of their lands to the United States\"—by\r\nsome nine tribes of the Mississippi and Missouri regions, among whom\r\nwere the Delawares—\"it was stipulated on the part of the Government that\r\ncertain sums should be paid to said tribes, amounting in the aggregate\r\nto $2,396,600, and that the same should be invested in safe and\r\nprofitable stocks, yielding an interest of not less than five per cent.\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\n\"Owing, however, to the embarrassed condition of the Treasury, it was\r\ndeemed advisable by Congress, in lieu of making the investments, to\r\nappropriate from year to year a sum equal to the annual interest at five\r\nper cent. on the several amounts required to be invested. On this amount\r\nthe Government has already paid from its treasury $1,742,240—a sum which\r\nis now equal to two-thirds of the principal, and will in a few years be\r\nequal to the whole, if the practice of appropriating the interest be\r\ncontinued. As there is no limitation to the period of these payments,\r\nsuch a policy indefinitely continued would prove a most costly one to\r\nthe Government. At the end of every twenty years it will have paid from\r\nthe public treasury by way of interest the full amount of the stipulated\r\ninvestments. *** The public finances are in a prosperous condition.\r\nInstead of fiscal embarrassment, there is now a redundancy of money, and\r\none of the vexed questions of the day is, What shall be done with the\r\nsurplus in the Treasury? Considering the premises, it seems to be quite\r\nclear that so much thereof as may be necessary for the purpose should be\r\npromptly applied to the fulfilment of our treaty obligations.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the influx of white settlers into Kansas was so great, it became\r\nevident that the Indian reservations there could not be kept intact; and\r\nthe Delawares made a large cession of their lands back to the United\r\nStates, to be restored to the public domain. For this they were to\r\nreceive ten thousand dollars. The sixth Article of this treaty provided\r\nfor the giving of annuities to their chiefs. \"The Delawares feel now, as\r\nheretofore, grateful to their old chiefs for their long and faithful\r\nservices. In former treaties, when their means were scanty, they\r\nprovided by small life annuities for the wants of the chiefs, some of\r\nwhom are now receiving them. These chiefs are poor, and the Delawares\r\nbelieve it their duty to keep them from want in their old age.\" The sum\r\nof ten thousand dollars, therefore, was to be paid to their five\r\nchiefs—two hundred and fifty dollars a year each.\r\n\r\nArticle second provided that the President should cause the land now\r\nreserved for their permanent home to be surveyed at any time when they\r\ndesired it, in the same manner as the ceded country was being surveyed\r\nfor the white settlers.\r\n\r\nIn the following year their agent writes thus of the results which have\r\nfollowed the opening of this large tract to white settlers: \"The Indians\r\nhave experienced enough to shake their confidence in the laws which\r\ngovern the white race. The irruptions of intruders on their trust lands,\r\ntheir bloody dissensions among themselves, outbreaks of party, etc.,\r\nmust necessarily, to these unsophisticated people, have presented our\r\nsystem of government in an unfavorable light.\r\n\r\n\"Numerous wrongs have been perpetrated on many parts of the reserve; the\r\nwhite men have wasted their most valuable timber with an unsparing hand;\r\nthe trust lands have been greatly injured in consequence of the\r\nsettlements made thereon. The Indians have complained, but to no\r\npurpose. I have found it useless to threaten legal proceedings. *** The\r\nGovernment is bound in good faith to protect this people. *** The\r\nagricultural portion of this tribe have done well this season; abundant\r\ncrops of corn promise them a supply of food for the ensuing year.\"\r\n\r\nThe simple-minded trustingness of these people is astonishing. Even now\r\nthey assent to an Article in this treaty which says that, as the means\r\narising from the sale of all this land they had given up would be more\r\nthan they could use, the remainder should be \"from time to time invested\r\nby the President of the United States in safe and profitable stocks; the\r\nprincipal to remain unimpaired, and the interest to be applied annually\r\nfor the civilization, education, and religious culture of the Delaware\r\npeople, and such other objects of a beneficial character as in his\r\njudgment are proper and necessary.\" Another Article stipulates that, if\r\nany of the Delawares are worthless or idle, the President can withhold\r\ntheir share of the moneys.\r\n\r\nArticle fifteenth says, gravely, \"The primary object of this instrument\r\nbeing to advance the interests and welfare of the Delaware people, it is\r\nagreed that, if it prove insufficient to effect these ends from causes\r\nwhich cannot now be foreseen, Congress may hereafter make such farther\r\nprovision, by law not inconsistent herewith, as experience may prove to\r\nbe necessary to promote the interests, peace, and happiness of the\r\nDelaware people.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the United States made its next treaty with the Delawares, in\r\nwhich they consented to give the Leavenworth, Pawnee, and Western\r\nRailroad Company right of way and certain lands in their reserve. In\r\n1861 another treaty, in which, as the railway company had not paid, and\r\nwas not able to pay, the $286,742 which it had promised to pay the\r\nDelawares, the President authorized the Commissioners of Indian Affairs\r\nto take the bonds of said railroad for that amount, and a mortgage on\r\none hundred thousand acres of the land which the Indians had sold to the\r\nrailway company.\r\n\r\nThere was another very curious bit of legislation in regard to the\r\nDelawares this year, viz., an Act of Congress authorizing the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury to enter on his books $423,990.26 to the credit of the\r\nDelawares; being the amount of bonds which the United States had\r\ninvested for the Delawares in State bonds of Missouri, Tennessee, and\r\nNorth Carolina, and which had been stolen while in the custody of Jacob\r\nThompson, late Secretary of the Interior, in whose department they had\r\nbeen deposited for safe-keeping. (At the same time there were stolen\r\n$66,735 belonging to the Iowas, and $169,686.75 belonging to the\r\nconfederated bands of Kaskaskias, Peorias, Piankeshaws, and Keas.)\r\n\r\nIn this year the Commissioner of Indian Affairs visited the Delawares,\r\nand reported them well advanced in civilization, in possession of\r\ncomfortable dwellings and farms, with personal property averaging one\r\nthousand dollars to an individual. Many of them were traders, and\r\ntravelled even to the boundaries of California.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 two regiments of Delawares and Osages enlisted as soldiers in an\r\nexpedition to the Indian Territory, under Colonel Weer, who says of\r\nthem: \"The Indian soldiers have far exceeded the most sanguine\r\nexpectations. They bore the brunt of the fighting done by the\r\nexpedition, and, had they been properly sustained, would have\r\neffectually ended the sway of the rebels in the Indian Territory.\"\r\n\r\nThere was during this year a terrible condition of affairs in Kansas and\r\nthe Indian Territory. The Indians were largely on the side of the\r\nrebels; yet, as the Indian Commissioner said in his report for this\r\nyear—a paragraph which is certainly a species of Irish bull—\"While the\r\nrebelling of a large portion of most of the tribes abrogates treaty\r\nobligations, and places them at our mercy, the very important fact\r\nshould not be forgotten that the Government first wholly failed to keep\r\nits treaty stipulations with them in protecting them.\" \"By withdrawing\r\nall the troops from the forts in the Indian Territory,\" it left them \"at\r\nthe mercy of the rebels.\" That is, we first broke the treaty; and then\r\ntheir subsequent failure to observe it \"placed them at our mercy!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" he says, \"a well-known fact that in many instances\r\nself-preservation compelled them to make the best terms they could with\r\nthe rebels; and that this is the case has been proved by a large number\r\nof them joining our army as soon as a sufficient force had penetrated\r\ntheir country to make it safe for them to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe Delawares enlisted, in 1862, one hundred and seventy men in the\r\nUnion army, and this out of a population of only two hundred males\r\nbetween the ages of eighteen and forty-five. There was probably no\r\ninstance in the whole country of such a ratio of volunteers as this.\r\nThey were reported as being in the army \"tractable, sober, watchful, and\r\nobedient to the commands of their superiors.\" They officered their own\r\ncompanies, and the use of spirituous liquors was strictly prohibited\r\namong them—a fact the more remarkable, as drunkenness was one of their\r\nchief vices at home.\r\n\r\nAlready, however, the \"interests\" of the white settlers in Kansas were\r\nbeginning to be clearly in opposition to the interests of the Indians.\r\n\"Circumscribed as they are, and closely surrounded by white settlements,\r\nI can see nothing in the future for them but destruction,\" says the\r\ncommissioner. \"I think it is for the interest of the Indians that they\r\nbe removed to some other locality as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Several of them have from fifty to one hundred acres of land in\r\ncultivation, with comfortable dwellings, barns, and out-houses. *** All\r\nthe families are domiciled in houses. *** Their crops of corn will yield\r\nlargely. Nearly every family will have a sufficiency for their own\r\nconsumption, and many of the larger farmers a surplus. *** There are but\r\nfew Delaware children of the age of twelve or fourteen that cannot\r\nread.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a community of a thousand people, larger than many of the\r\nfarming villages in New England, for instance, \"the average of personal\r\nproperty amounting to one thousand dollars;\" all living in their own\r\nhouses, cultivating from fifty to one hundred acres of land, nearly all\r\nthe children in schools, and yet it is for their \"interest to be moved!\"\r\nThe last sentence of the following paragraph tells the story:\r\n\r\n\"When peace is restored to our country, a removal of all the Indians in\r\nKansas will certainly be advantageous to them as well as to the State.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1863 their agent writes: \"Since the question of the removal of the\r\nIndians from Kansas has been agitated, improvements have been much\r\nretarded among the Delawares and other Indians in Kansas.\r\n\r\n\"I think they are sufficiently prepared to make new treaties with the\r\nGovernment, *** having in view settlement in the Southern country of\r\nthose who elect to emigrate, compensation for the homes they relinquish,\r\nand a permission to remain in their present homes for all who are\r\nopposed to leaving Kansas.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time, \"one-half the adult population are in the volunteer\r\nservice of the United States. They make the best of soldiers, and are\r\nhighly valued by their officers. *** No State in the Union has furnished\r\nso many men for our armies, from the same ratio of population, as has\r\nthe Delaware tribe. *** The tribe has 3900 acres of land under\r\ncultivation, in corn, wheat, oats, and potatoes.\" (And yet one-half the\r\nadult men are away!)\r\n\r\nIn this year the Delawares, being \"sufficiently prepared\" to make new\r\ntreaties looking to their removal out of the way of the white settlers\r\nin Kansas, petitioned the United States Government to permit them to\r\ntake eight hundred dollars of their annuity funds to pay the expense of\r\nsending a delegation of their chiefs to the Rocky Mountains, to see if\r\nthey could find there a country which would answer for their new home.\r\nThe commissioner advises that they should not be allowed to go there,\r\nbut to the Indian Territory, of which he says, \"The geographical\r\nsituation is such that its occupation by lawless whites can be more\r\neasily prevented than any other portion of the country.\" \"By common\r\nconsent, this appears to be recognized as the Indian country, and I have\r\nstrong hopes that it will eventually prove for them a prosperous and\r\nhappy home.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1864 their agent writes that the greater part of the personal\r\nproperty owned by the Delawares is in stock, \"which is constantly being\r\npreyed upon by the whites, until it has become so reduced that it is\r\ndifficult to obtain a good animal in the nation.\" He says he is unable,\r\nfor the want of proper information, to determine what amount they had at\r\nthe beginning of the year, but believes, from observation, \"that it has\r\nundergone a depletion to the extent of twenty thousand dollars in the\r\npast year.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a picture of a distressed community! The men away at war, old men,\r\nwomen, and children working the farms, and twenty thousand dollars of\r\nstock stolen from them in one year!\r\n\r\nIn 1865 a large proportion of those who had enlisted in the United\r\nStates Army were mustered out, and returned home. The agent says: \"It\r\naffords me great pleasure to chronicle the continued loyalty of this\r\ntribe during the past four years; and, as events tend westward, they\r\nevince every disposition to aid the Government by contributing their\r\nknowledge of the country to the officers of the army, and rendering such\r\nservices thereto as they are qualified to perform.\"\r\n\r\nThey \"have distinguished themselves in many instances in the conflicts\r\non the borders;\" nevertheless, in this same year, these discharged\r\nsoldiers were prohibited by the Government from carrying revolvers. When\r\nthe commissioner instructed the agent to disarm them, the agent very\r\nproperly replied, stating the difficulties in the case: \"Firstly, what\r\ndisposition is to be made of weapons taken forcibly from these Indians?\r\nSecondly, many of these Indians are intelligent, only using weapons when\r\nany well-disposed white person would have done so; and if one class is\r\ndisarmed, all must be;\" on which the commissioner so modified his order\r\nas to say that \"peaceably disposed Indians\" might keep the usual weapons\r\nused by them in hunting; but whenever they visited agencies or towns\r\nthey must deliver up all weapons to the agent, who would receipt for\r\nthem, and return them \"at proper times.\" This order is to be enforced,\r\nif possible, by an \"appeal to their better judgment.\"\r\n\r\nThere are no records of the practical working of this order. Very\r\npossibly it fell at once, by its own weight, into the already large\r\ncategory of dead-letter laws in regard to Indians. It is impossible to\r\nimagine an Indian who had served four years as an officer in the army\r\n(for the Delawares officered their own companies) submitting to be\r\ndisarmed by an agent on any day when he might need to go to Atchison on\r\nbusiness. Probably even that \"appeal to his better judgment\" which the\r\ncommissioner recommends, would only draw from him a very forcible\r\nstatement to the effect that any man who went about in Kansas at that\r\ntime unarmed was a fool.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the Indian Commissioner reports that \"the State of Kansas is\r\nfast being filled by an energetic population who appreciate good land;\r\nand as the Indian reservations were selected as being the best in the\r\nState, but _one result can be expected to follow_.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the Indians are anxious to move to the Indian country south of\r\nKansas, where white settlers cannot interfere with them.\r\n\r\n\"Intermingled as the Kansas reservations are with the public lands, and\r\nsurrounded in most cases by white settlers who too often act on the\r\nprinciple that an Indian has no rights that a white man is bound to\r\nrespect, they are injured and annoyed in many ways. Their stock are\r\nstolen, their fences broken down, their timber destroyed, their young\r\nmen plied with whiskey, their women debauched; so that, while the\r\nuncivilized are kept in a worse than savage state, having the crimes of\r\ncivilization forced upon them, those farther advanced, and disposed to\r\nhonest industry, are discouraged beyond endurance.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this the Delawares raised, in 1866, 72,000 bushels of\r\ngrain, 13,000 bushels of potatoes, and owned 5000 head of cattle.\r\n\r\nIn July of this year a treaty was made with them, providing for the\r\nremoval to the Indian Territory of all who should not decide to become\r\ncitizens of Kansas, and the sale of their lands. The superintendent of\r\nthe Fort Leavenworth Agency writes at this time: \"The running of the\r\nUnion Pacific Railroad through the Delawares' diminished reserve has\r\nbeen a source of grievous annoyance and damage to the Delawares, as has\r\nalso an organization styled the Delaware Lumber Company. Out of these\r\ntwo companies grew much complaint and investigation, resulting in the\r\nappointment of a special agent to sell to the railroad the timber\r\nrequired for the construction of the road, and no more. The Delaware\r\nLumber Company being thus restricted\" (_i.e._, being prevented from\r\nhelping themselves to the Indians' timber), immediately \"gave up their\r\nbusiness, and stopped their mills,\" but not before they had damaged the\r\nIndians' property to the amount of twenty-eight thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nTwenty thousand dollars' worth of stock and twenty-eight thousand\r\ndollars' worth of timber having been stolen in two years from this\r\nlittle village of farmers, no wonder they are \"sufficiently prepared to\r\nmove.\" Other causes have conspired also to render them in haste to be\r\ngone. The perpetual expectation of being obliged to remove had unsettled\r\nthe whole community, and made them indifferent to effort and\r\nimprovement. The return of their young men from the war had also had a\r\ndemoralizing effect. Drunken frays were not uncommon, in which deadly\r\nweapons were used, spite of the Department's regulations for disarming\r\nall Indians.\r\n\r\nIn July of this year the Delaware chiefs, distressed by this state of\r\naffairs, drew up for their nation a code of laws which compare favorably\r\nwith the laws of so-called civilized States.[9]\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Art. 8.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the Delawares are said to be \"very impatient to be gone from\r\ntheir reserve, in order to build houses this autumn for winter use, and\r\nto be fencing fields for the ensuing year at their new reserve.\" The\r\nannuities due them in April of this year have not been paid till autumn,\r\nand this has delayed their movements. Many of the young men are still\r\naway, acting as scouts and guides in the army. In the course of this\r\nyear and the next the whole tribe moved by detachments to their new\r\nhome. \"Those who removed during the winter went to work in a laudable\r\nmanner, and made their improvements—many building comfortable houses and\r\nraising respectable crops\" the first season. They are said to be now in\r\na fair way to be better off than ever before. They have \"given up their\r\ntribal organization and become Cherokee citizens. They report that they\r\nare well pleased with their new homes; and, being separated from the\r\nmany temptations by which they were surrounded in their old reservation,\r\nare learning to appreciate the many benefits to be derived from leading\r\na temperate, industrious, and consequently a prosperous and happy life.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1869 it is said that, \"as soon as the final arrangement relative to\r\ntheir funds is perfected, they will lose their nationality and become\r\nidentified with the Cherokees.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1870 we find nearly all the Delawares in Indian Territory; but it\r\nseems that, owing to a carelessly surveyed boundary, some three hundred\r\nof them had settled down on lands which were outside the Cherokee\r\nReservation, and had been assigned by the Government to the Osages. This\r\nunfortunate three hundred, therefore, are removed again; this time to\r\nthe lands of the Peorias, where they ask permission to establish\r\nthemselves. But in the mean time, as they had made previous arrangements\r\nwith the Cherokees, and all their funds had been transferred to the\r\nCherokee Nation, it is thought to be \"very unfortunate that they should\r\nbe thus obliged to seek a new home;\" and it is said to be \"quite\r\ndesirable that the parties in interest should reconcile their unsettled\r\naffairs to mutual advantage.\"\r\n\r\nWe are too much inclined to read these records carelessly, without\r\ntrying to picture to ourselves the condition of affairs which they\r\nrepresent. It has come to be such an accepted thing in the history and\r\nfate of the Indian that he is to be always pushed on, always in advance\r\nof what is called the march of civilization, that to the average mind\r\nstatements of these repeated removals come with no startling force, and\r\nsuggest no vivid picture of details, only a sort of reassertion of an\r\nabstract general principle. But pausing to consider for a moment what\r\nsuch statements actually mean and involve; imagining such processes\r\napplied to some particular town or village that we happen to be\r\nintimately acquainted with, we can soon come to a new realization of the\r\nfull bearing and import of them; such uprooting, such perplexity, such\r\nloss, such confusion and uncertainty, inflicted once on any community of\r\nwhite people anywhere in our land, would be considered quite enough to\r\ndestroy its energies and blight its prospects for years. It may very\r\nwell be questioned whether any of our small communities would have\r\nrecovered from such successive shocks, changes, and forced migrations,\r\nas soon and as well as have many of these Indian tribes. It is very\r\ncertain that they would not have submitted to them as patiently.\r\n\r\nAfter this we find in the Official Reports no distinctive mention of the\r\nDelawares by name, except of a few who had been for some time living in\r\nthe Indian Territory, and were not included in the treaty provisions at\r\nthe time of the removal from Kansas. This little handful—eighty-one in\r\nnumber—is all that now remain to bear the name of that strong and\r\nfriendly people to whom, a little more than one hundred years ago, we\r\npromised that they should be our brothers forever, and be entitled to a\r\nrepresentation in our Congress.\r\n\r\nThis band of Delawares is associated with six other dwindled remnants of\r\ntribes—the Caddoes, Ionies, Wichitas, Towaconies, Wacoes, Keechies, and\r\nComanches—on the Wichita Agency, in Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nThey are all reported as being \"peaceable, well disposed,\" and \"actively\r\nengaged in agricultural pursuits.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Delawares it is said, in 1878, that they were not able to\r\ncultivate so much land as they had intended to during that year, \"on\r\naccount of loss of stock by horse-thieves.\"\r\n\r\nEven here, it seems, in that \"Indian country south of Kansas, where\" (as\r\nthey were told) \"white settlers could not interfere with them,\" enemies\r\nlie in wait for them, as of old, to rob and destroy; even here the\r\nGovernment is, as before, unable to protect them; and in all\r\nprobability, the tragedies of 1866 and 1867 will before long be\r\nre-enacted with still sadder results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                             THE CHEYENNES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur first treaty with the Cheyennes was made in 1825, at the mouth of\r\nthe Teton River. It was merely a treaty of amity and friendship, and\r\nacknowledgment on the part of the Cheyennes of the \"supremacy\" of the\r\nUnited States. Two years before this, President Monroe reported the\r\n\"Chayenes\" to be \"a tribe of three thousand two hundred and fifty souls,\r\ndwelling and hunting on a river of the same name, a western tributary of\r\nthe Missouri, a little above the Great Bend.\" Ten years later, Catlin,\r\nthe famous painter of Indians, met a \"Shienne\" chief and squaw among the\r\nSioux, and painted their portraits. He says, \"The Shiennes are a small\r\ntribe of about three thousand in number, living neighbors to the Sioux\r\non the west of them, between the Black Hills and the Rocky Mountains.\r\nThere is no finer race of men than these in North America, and none\r\nsuperior in stature, except the Osages: scarcely a man in the tribe full\r\ngrown who is less than six feet in height.\" They are \"the richest in\r\nhorses of any tribe on the continent; living where the greatest herds of\r\nwild horses are grazing on the prairies, which they catch in great\r\nnumbers, and sell to the Sioux, Mandans, and other tribes, as well as to\r\nthe fur-traders.\r\n\r\n\"These people are the most desperate set of warriors and horsemen,\r\nhaving carried on almost unceasing wars with the Pawnees and Blackfeet.\r\nThe chief was clothed in a handsome dress of deer-skins, very neatly\r\ngarnished with broad bands of porcupine-quill work down the sleeves of\r\nhis shirt and leggings. The woman was comely, and beautifully dressed.\r\nHer dress of the mountain-sheepskin tastefully ornamented with quills\r\nand beads, and her hair plaited in large braids that hung down on her\r\nbreast.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1837 the agent for the \"Sioux, Cheyennes, and Poncas\" reports that\r\n\"all these Indians live exclusively by the chase;\" and that seems to be\r\nthe sum and substance of his information about them. He adds, also, that\r\nthese remote wandering tribes have a great fear of the border tribes,\r\nand wish to avoid them. In 1838 the Cheyennes are reported as carrying\r\non trade at a post on the Arkansas River near the Santa Fe road, but\r\nstill depending on the chase.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 they are spoken of as a \"wandering tribe on the Platte;\" and in\r\nthe same year, Mr. D. D. Mitchell, Supt. of Indian Affairs, with his\r\nhead-quarters at St. Louis, writes: \"Generations will pass away before\r\nthis territory\" [the territory in which the wild tribes of the Upper\r\nMississippi were then wandering] \"becomes much more circumscribed; for\r\nif we draw a line running north and south, so as to cross the Missouri\r\nabout the mouth of the Vermilion River, we shall designate the limits\r\nbeyond which civilized men are never likely to settle. At this point the\r\nCreator seems to have said to the tides of emigration that are annually\r\nrolling toward the West, 'Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.' At\r\nall events, if they go beyond this, they will never stop on the east\r\nside of the Rocky Mountains. The utter destitution of timber, the\r\nsterility of sandy soil, together with the coldness and dryness of the\r\nclimate, furnish obstacles which not even Yankee enterprise is likely to\r\novercome. A beneficent Creator seems to have intended this dreary region\r\nas an asylum for the Indians, when the force of circumstances shall have\r\ndriven them from the last acre of the fertile soil which they once\r\npossessed. Here no inducements are offered to the ever-restless Saxon\r\nbreed to erect their huts. *** The time may arrive when the whole of the\r\nWestern Indians will be forced to seek a resting-place in this Great\r\nAmerican Desert; and this, in all probability, will form a new era in\r\nthe history of this singular and ill-fated race. They will remain a\r\nwandering, half civilized, though happy people. 'Their flocks and herds\r\nwill cover a thousand hills,' and will furnish beef and mutton for a\r\nportion of the dense population of whites that will swarm in the more\r\nfertile sections of the great valley of the Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\nThis line, recommended by Mr. Mitchell, runs just east of Dakota,\r\nthrough the extreme eastern portion of Nebraska, a little to the east of\r\nthe middle of Kansas, through the middle of Indian Territory and Texas,\r\nto the Gulf of Mexico. Montana, Idaho, Colorado, and New Mexico, all lie\r\nwest of it.\r\n\r\nThe records of the War Department for 1846 contain an interesting\r\naccount of a visit made to all the wild tribes of the Upper Missouri\r\nAgency—the Yankton Sioux, the Arrikarees, Mandans, Assinaboines,\r\nArapahoes, Cheyennes, and others. In reply to the agent's remonstrances\r\nwith one of the Sioux chiefs in regard to their perpetual warring with\r\neach other, the chief \"was very laconic and decided, remarking 'that if\r\ntheir great-grandfather desired them to cease to war with their enemies,\r\nwhy did he not send each of them a petticoat, and make squaws of them at\r\nonce?'\" This same chief refused to allow the boys of his tribe to go to\r\nthe Choctaw schools, saying, \"They would return, as the few did who went\r\nto St. Louis, drunkards, or die on the way.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cheyennes and other Indians living on the Platte complained bitterly\r\nof the passage of the emigrants through their country. They said they\r\nought to be compensated for the right of way, and that the emigrants\r\nshould be restricted by law and the presence of a military force from\r\nburning the grass, and from unnecessary destruction of game. They were\r\nsystematically plundered and demoralized by traders. Whiskey was to be\r\nhad without difficulty; sugar and coffee were sold at one dollar a\r\npound; ten-cent calico at one dollar a yard; corn at seventy-five cents\r\na gallon, and higher.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 a law was passed by Congress forbidding the introduction of\r\nwhiskey into the Indian country, and even the partial enforcement of\r\nthis law had a most happy effect. Foremost among those to acknowledge\r\nthe benefits of it were the traders themselves, who said that the\r\nIndians' demand for substantial articles of trade was augmented two\r\nhundred per cent.: \"They enjoy much better health, look much better, and\r\nare better people. *** You now rarely ever hear of a murder committed,\r\nwhereas when whiskey was plenty in that country murder was a daily\r\noccurrence.\" These Indians themselves were said to be \"opposed to the\r\nintroduction of ardent spirits into their country; *** but, like almost\r\nall other Indians, will use it if you give it to them, and when under\r\nits influence are dangerous and troublesome.\" There were at this time\r\nnearly forty-six thousand of these Upper Missouri Indians. Five bands of\r\nthem—\"the Sioux, Cheyennes, Gros Ventres, Mandans, and Poncas\"—were\r\n\"excellent Indians, devotedly attached to the white man,\" living \"in\r\npeace and friendship with our Government,\" and \"entitled to the special\r\nfavor and good opinion of the Department for their uniform good conduct\r\nand pacific relations.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1848 it was estimated from the returns made by traders that the trade\r\nof this agency amounted to $400,000. Among the items were 25,000 buffalo\r\ntongues. In consequence of this prosperity on the part of the Indians,\r\nthere was a partial cessation of hostilities on the whites; but it was\r\nstill a perilous journey to cross the plains, and in 1849 the necessity\r\nfor making some sort of treaty stipulations with all these wild tribes\r\nbegins to be forced emphatically upon the attention of the United States\r\nGovernment. A safe highway across the continent must be opened. It is a\r\nnoticeable thing, however, that, even as late as this in the history of\r\nour diplomatic relations with the Indian, his right to a certain control\r\nas well as occupancy of the soil was instinctively recognized. The\r\nSecretary of the Interior, in his report for 1849, says: \"The wild\r\ntribes of Indians who have their hunting-grounds in the great prairie\r\nthrough which our emigrants to California pass, have, during the year,\r\nbeen more than usually pacific. They have suffered our people to pass\r\nthrough their country with little interruption, though they travelled in\r\ngreat numbers, and consumed on their route much grass and game. For\r\nthese the Indians expect compensation, and their claim is just.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary, therefore, concurs in the recommendation of the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs that treaties be negotiated with these\r\ntribes, stipulating for the right of way through their country, and the\r\nuse of grass and game, paying them therefor small annuities in useful\r\narticles of merchandise, and agricultural implements, and instruction.\r\n\"The right of way\"—\"through their country.\" A great deal is conceded,\r\ncovered, and conveyed by such phrases as these. If they mean anything,\r\nthey mean all that the Indians ever claimed.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were supposed to be influenced to this peaceableness and\r\ngood-will more by a hope of rewards and gifts than by a wholesome fear\r\nof the power of the Government; and it was proposed to take a delegation\r\nof chiefs to Washington, \"in order that they may acquire some knowledge\r\nof our greatness and strength, which will make a salutary impression on\r\nthem, and through them on their brethren,\" and \"will tend to influence\r\nthem to continue peaceful relations.\"\r\n\r\nIt begins to dawn upon the Government's perception that peace is cheaper\r\nas well as kinder than war. \"We never can whip them into friendship,\"\r\nsays one of the superintendents of the Upper Missouri Agency. A treaty\r\n\"can do no harm, and the expense would be less than that of a six\r\nmonths' war. *** Justice as well as policy requires that we should make\r\nsome remuneration for the damages these Indians sustain in consequence\r\nof the destruction of their game, timber, etc., by the whites passing\r\nthrough their country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their game, timber,\" \"their country,\" again. The perpetual recurrence\r\nof this possessive pronoun, and of such phrases as these in all that the\r\nGovernment has said about the Indians, and in all that it has said to\r\nthem, is very significant.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the Indian Commission writes that \"it is much to be regretted\r\nthat no appropriation was made at the last session of Congress for\r\nnegotiating treaties with the wild tribes of the plains. These Indians\r\nhave long held undisputed possession of this extensive region; and,\r\nregarding it as their own, they consider themselves entitled to\r\ncompensation not only for the right of way through their territory, but\r\nfor the great and injurious destruction of game, grass, and timber\r\ncommitted by our troops and emigrants.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill providing for the negotiation of these treaties was passed\r\nunanimously by the Senate, but \"the unhappy difficulties existing on the\r\nsubject of slavery\" delayed it in the House until it was too late to be\r\ncarried into effect.\r\n\r\nAll the tribes had been informed of this pending bill, and were looking\r\nforward to it with great interest and anxiety. In 1849 they had all\r\nexpressed themselves as \"very anxious to be instructed in agriculture\r\nand the civilized arts.\" Already the buffalo herds were thinning and\r\ndisappearing. From time immemorial the buffalo had furnished them food,\r\nclothing, and shelter; with its disappearance, starvation stared them in\r\nthe face, and they knew it. There can be no doubt that at this time all\r\nthe wild tribes of the Upper Missouri region—the Sioux, Cheyennes,\r\nArapahoes—were ready and anxious to establish friendly relations with\r\nthe United States Government, and to enter into some arrangement by\r\nwhich some means of future subsistence, and some certainty of lands\r\nenough to live on, could be secured to them. Meantime they hunted with\r\ngreater diligence than ever; and in this one year alone had sold to the\r\nfur-traders within the limits of one agency $330,000 worth of\r\nbuffalo-robes, and \"furs, peltries, and miscellaneous goods to the\r\namount of $60,000. What they thus receive for their furs, robes, etc.,\r\nwould be ample for their support,\" says Hatton, \"were it not that they\r\nhave to give such exorbitant prices for what they purchase from the\r\nwhites.\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter and spring of 1850 all these tribes were visited by an\r\nagent of the Government. He reported them as \"friendly disposed,\" but\r\nvery impatient to come to some understanding about the right of way.\r\n\"This is what the Indians want, and what they are anxious about; having\r\nbeen told long since, and so often repeated by travellers passing (who\r\ncare little about the consequences of promises so they slip through\r\nsafely and unmolested themselves), that their 'Great Father' would soon\r\nreward them liberally for the right of way, the destruction of timber,\r\ngame, etc., as well as for any kindness shown Americans passing through\r\ntheir country.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1851 this much desired treaty was made. Seven of the\r\nprairie and mountain tribes gathered in great force at Fort Laramie. The\r\nreport of this council contains some interesting and noticeable points.\r\n\r\n\"We were eighteen days encamped together, during which time the Indians\r\nconducted themselves in a manner that excited the admiration and\r\nsurprise of every one. The different tribes, although hereditary\r\nenemies, interchanged daily visits, both in their individual and\r\nnational capacities; smoked and feasted together; exchanged presents;\r\nadopted each other's children, according to their own customs; and did\r\nall that was held sacred or solemn in the eyes of these Indians to prove\r\nthe sincerity of their peaceful and friendly intentions, both among\r\nthemselves and with the citizens of the United States lawfully residing\r\namong them or passing through the country.\"\r\n\r\nBy this treaty the Indians formally conceded to the United States the\r\nright to establish roads, military or otherwise, throughout the Indian\r\ncountry, \"so far as they claim or exercise ownership over it.\"\r\n\r\nThey agreed \"to maintain peaceful relations among themselves, and to\r\nabstain from all depredations upon whites passing through their country,\r\nand to make restitution for any damages or loss that a white man shall\r\nsustain by the acts of their people.\"\r\n\r\nFor all the damages which they had suffered up to that time in\r\nconsequence of the passing of the whites through their country, they\r\naccepted the presents then received as payment in full.\r\n\r\nAn annuity of $50,000 a year for fifty years to come was promised to\r\nthem. This was the price of the \"right of way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty thousand dollars for a limited period of years is a small amount\r\nto be distributed among at least fifty thousand Indians, especially when\r\nwe consider that we have taken away, or are rapidly taking away from\r\nthem all means of support,\" says one of the makers of this treaty. There\r\nwould probably be no dissent from this opinion. A dollar a year, even\r\nassured to one for fifty years, seems hardly an adequate compensation\r\nfor the surrender of all other \"means of support.\"\r\n\r\nThe report continues: \"Viewing the treaty in all its provisions, I am\r\nclearly of opinion that it is the best that could have been made for\r\nboth parties. I am, moreover, of the opinion that it will be observed\r\nand carried out in as good faith on the part of the Indians as it will\r\non the part of the United States and the white people thereof. There was\r\nan earnest solemnity and a deep conviction of the necessity of adopting\r\nsome such measures evident in the conduct and manners of the Indians\r\nthroughout the whole council. On leaving for their respective homes, and\r\nbidding each other adieu, they gave the strongest possible evidence of\r\ntheir friendly intentions for the future, and the mutual confidence and\r\ngood faith which they had in each other. Invitations were freely given\r\nand as freely accepted by each of the tribes to interchange visits,\r\ntalk, and smoke together like brothers, upon ground where they had never\r\nbefore met except for the purpose of scalping each other. This, to my\r\nmind, was conclusive evidence of the sincerity of the Indians, and\r\nnothing but bad management or some untoward misfortune ever can break\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior, in his report for this year, speaks with\r\nsatisfaction of the treaties negotiated with Indians during the year,\r\nand says: \"It cannot be denied that most of the depredations committed\r\nby the Indians on our frontiers are the offspring of dire necessity. The\r\nadvance of our population compels them to relinquish their fertile\r\nlands, and seek refuge in sterile regions which furnish neither corn nor\r\ngame: impelled by hunger, they seize the horses, mules, and cattle of\r\nthe pioneers, to relieve their wants and satisfy the cravings of nature.\r\nThey are immediately pursued, and, when overtaken, severely punished.\r\nThis creates a feeling of revenge on their part, which seeks its\r\ngratification in outrages on the persons and property of peaceable\r\ninhabitants. The whole country then becomes excited, and a desolating\r\nwar, attended with a vast sacrifice of blood and treasure, ensues. This,\r\nit is believed, is a true history of the origin of most of our Indian\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\n\"All history admonishes us of the difficulty of civilizing a wandering\r\nrace who live mainly upon game. To tame a savage you must tie him down\r\nto the soil. You must make him understand the value of property, and the\r\nbenefits of its separate ownership. You must appeal to those selfish\r\nprinciples implanted by Divine Providence in the nature of man for the\r\nwisest purposes, and make them minister to civilization and refinement.\r\nYou must encourage the appropriation of lands by individuals; attach\r\nthem to their homes by the ties of interest; teach them the uses of\r\nagriculture and the arts of peace; *** and they should be taught to look\r\nforward to the day when they may be elevated to the dignity of American\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\"By means like these we shall soon reap our reward in the suppression of\r\nIndian depredations; in the diminution of the expenses of the Department\r\nof War; in a valuable addition to our productive population; in the\r\nincrease of our agriculture and commerce; and in the proud consciousness\r\nthat we have removed from our national escutcheon the stain left on it\r\nby our acknowledged injustice to the Indian race.\"\r\n\r\nWe find the Cheyennes, therefore, in 1851, pledged to peace and\r\ngood-will toward their Indian neighbors, and to the white emigrants\r\npouring through their country. For this conceded right of way they are\r\nto have a dollar a year apiece, in \"goods and animals;\" and it is\r\nsupposed that they will be able to eke out this support by hunting\r\nbuffaloes, which are still not extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs writes: \"Notwithstanding the\r\nmountain and prairie Indians continue to suffer from the vast number of\r\nemigrants who pass through their country, destroying their means of\r\nsupport, and scattering disease and death among them, yet those who were\r\nparties to the treaty concluded at Fort Laramie, in the fall of 1851,\r\nhave been true to their obligations, and have remained at peace among\r\nthemselves and with the whites.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the superintendent writes: \"Congress made a very liberal\r\nappropriation of $100,000 to make a treaty with the prairie and mountain\r\ntribes. A very satisfactory treaty was made with them last fall at Fort\r\nLaramie, the conditions of which, on their part, have been faithfully\r\nobserved—no depredations having been committed during the past season by\r\nany of the tribes parties to the Fort Laramie treaty. The Senate amended\r\nthe treaty, substituting _fifteen_ instead of _fifty_ years as the\r\nperiod for which they were to have received an annual supply of goods,\r\nanimals, etc., at the discretion of the President. This modification of\r\nthe treaty I think very proper, as the condition of these wandering\r\nhordes will be entirely changed during the next fifteen years. The\r\ntreaty, however, should have been sent back to the Indians for the\r\npurpose of obtaining their sanction to the modification, as was done in\r\nthe case of the Sioux treaty negotiated by Commissioners Ramsey and Lea.\r\nIt is hoped this oversight will be corrected as early as practicable\r\nnext spring, otherwise the large amounts already expended will have been\r\nuselessly wasted, and the Indians far more dissatisfied than ever.\"\r\n\r\nTo comment on the bad faith of this action on the part of Congress would\r\nbe a waste of words; but its impolicy is so glaring that one's\r\nastonishment cannot keep silent—its impolicy and also its incredible\r\nniggardliness. A dollar apiece a year, \"in goods, animals,\" etc., those\r\nIndians had been promised that they should have for fifty years. It must\r\nhave been patent to the meanest intellect that this was little to pay\r\neach year to any one man from whom we were taking away, as the\r\ncommissioner said, \"his means of support.\" But, unluckily for the\r\nIndians, there were fifty thousand of them. It entered into some thrifty\r\nCongressman's head to multiply fifty by fifty, and the aggregate\r\nterrified everybody. This was much more likely to have been the cause of\r\nthe amendment than the cause assigned by the superintendent, viz., the\r\nprobable change of localities of all the \"wandering hordes\" in the next\r\nfifteen years. No doubt it would be troublesome to the last degree to\r\ndistribute fifty thousand dollars, \"in goods, animals,\" etc., to fifty\r\nthousand Indians wandering over the entire Upper Missouri region; but no\r\nmore troublesome, surely, in the sixteenth year than in the fifteenth.\r\nThe sophistry is too transparent; it does not in the least gloss over\r\nthe fact that, within the first year after the making of our first\r\ntreaty of any moment with these tribes—while they to a man, the whole\r\nfifty thousand of them, kept their faith with us—we broke ours with them\r\nin the meanest of ways—robbing them of more than two-thirds of the money\r\nwe had promised to pay.\r\n\r\nAll the tribes \"promptly\" assented to this amendment, however; so says\r\nthe Annual Report of the Indian Commissioner for 1853; and adds that,\r\nwith a single exception, they have maintained friendly relations among\r\nthemselves, and \"manifested an increasing confidence in and kindness\r\ntoward the whites.\"\r\n\r\nSome of them have begun to raise corn, beans, pumpkins, etc., but depend\r\nchiefly on the hunt for their support. But the agent who was sent to\r\ndistribute to them their annuities, and to secure their assent to the\r\namendment to the treaty, reports: \"The Cheyennes and the Arapahoes, and\r\nmany of the Sioux, are actually in a starving state. They are in abject\r\nwant of food half the year, and their reliance for that scanty supply,\r\nin the rapid decrease of the buffalo, is fast disappearing. The travel\r\nupon the roads drives them off, or else confines them to a narrow path\r\nduring the period of emigration, and the different tribes are forced to\r\ncontend with hostile nations in seeking support for their villages.\r\nTheir women are pinched with want, and their children constantly crying\r\nwith hunger. Their arms, moreover, are unfitted to the pursuit of\r\nsmaller game, and thus the lapse of a few years presents only the\r\nprospect of a gradual famine.\" And in spite of such suffering, these\r\nIndians commit no depredations, and show increasing confidence in and\r\nkindness toward the whites.\r\n\r\nThis agent, who has passed many years among the Indians, speaks with\r\ngreat feeling of the sad prospect staring them in the face. He says:\r\n\"But one course remains which promises any permanent relief to them, or\r\nany lasting benefit to the country in which they dwell; that is, simply\r\nto make such modifications in the 'intercourse' laws as will invite the\r\nresidence of traders among them, and open the whole Indian Territory for\r\nsettlement. Trade is the only civilizer of the Indian. It has been the\r\nprecursor of all civilization heretofore, and it will be of all\r\nhereafter. It teaches the Indian the value of other things besides the\r\nspoils of the chase, and offers to him other pursuits and excitements\r\nthan those of war. All obstructions to its freedom, therefore, only\r\noperate injuriously. *** The Indians would soon lose their nomadic\r\ncharacter, and forget the relations of tribes. *** And this, while it\r\nwould avoid the cruel necessity of our present policy—to wit,\r\nextinction—would make them an element in the population, and sharer in\r\nthe prosperity of the country.\" He says of the \"system of removals, and\r\ncongregating tribes in small parcels of territory,\" that it has\r\n\"eventuated injuriously on those who have been subjected to it. It is\r\nthe legalized murder of a whole nation. It is expensive, vicious, and\r\ninhuman, and producing these consequences, and these alone. The custom,\r\nbeing judged by its fruits, should not be persisted in.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in the face of such statements, such protests as these, that the\r\nUnited States Government has gone steadily on with its policy, so\r\ncalled, in regard to the treatment of the Indian.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the report from the Upper Missouri region is still of peace and\r\nfidelity on the part of all the Indians who joined in the Fort Laramie\r\ntreaty. \"Not a single instance of murder, robbery, or other depredation\r\nhas been committed by them, either on the neighboring tribes parties to\r\nthe treaty or on whites. This is the more remarkable, as before the\r\ntreaty they were foremost in the van of thieves and robbers—always at\r\nwar, pillaging whoever they met, and annoying their own traders in their\r\nown forts.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of this year the Cheyennes began to be dissatisfied and\r\nimpertinent. At a gathering of the northern band at Fort Laramie, one of\r\nthe chiefs demanded that the travel over the Platte road should be\r\nstopped. He also, if the interpreter was to be relied on, said that next\r\nyear the Government must send them out one thousand white women for\r\nwives. The Southern Cheyennes had given up to their agent some Mexican\r\nprisoners whom they had taken in the spring, and this act, it was\r\nsupposed, had seemed to the northern band a needless interference on the\r\npart of the United States. Moreover, it was a matter constantly open to\r\nthe observation of all friendly Indians that the hostiles, who were\r\ncontinually plundering and attacking emigrant trains, made, on the\r\nwhole, more profit out of war than they made out of peace. On the North\r\nPlatte road during this year the Pawnees alone had stolen several\r\nthousands of dollars' worth of goods; and, in addition to this, there\r\nwas the pressure of public sentiment—a thing which is as powerful among\r\nIndians as among whites. It was popular to be on the war-path: the\r\nwhites were invaders; it was brave and creditable to slay them. Taking\r\nall these things into account, it was only to be wondered at that these\r\nCheyennes, Arapahoes, and Sioux kept to the provisions of their treaty\r\nat all. Nevertheless, the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and some bands of the\r\nSioux continued peaceable and friendly; and in 1855 they begged to be\r\nsupplied with a farmer to teach them how to farm; also with a\r\nblacksmith. Their agent strongly recommends that this be done, saying\r\nthat there is not \"in the whole Indian country a more favorable location\r\nfor a farm for grazing stock and game than the South Platte. In a very\r\nshort period of time the Arapahoes and Cheyennes would become fixed and\r\nsettled, and a part of each tribe—the old women and men—would become\r\nagriculturists; rude, it is true, yet sufficiently skilful to raise\r\ncorn, potatoes, and beans, and dwell in cabins or fixed habitations.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1856 the Cheyennes were, by a disastrous accident,\r\nforced into the position of hostiles. A small war-band went out to\r\nattack the Pawnees; they were in camp near the North Platte road: as the\r\nmail-wagon was passing, two of the Cheyennes ran toward it to beg\r\ntobacco. The mail-carrier, terrified, fired on them, and the Indians\r\nfired back, wounding him; the chiefs rushed out, stopped the firing,\r\nexplained the matter, and then severely flogged the Indians who had\r\nreturned the mail-carrier's fire. But the mischief had been done.\r\n\r\nThe mail-carrier reported his having been fired at by a Cheyenne Indian,\r\nand the next day troops from Fort Kearny attacked the Indians and killed\r\nsix of the war-party. The rest refused to fight, and ran away, leaving\r\ntheir camp and all it contained. The war-party, thoroughly exasperated,\r\nattacked an emigrant train, killed two men and a child, and took one\r\nwoman captive. The next day they killed her, because she could not ride\r\non horseback and keep up with them. Within a short time two more small\r\nwar-parties had left the band, attacked trains, and killed two men, two\r\nwomen, and a child. The chiefs at first could not restrain them, but in\r\nSeptember they sent a delegation to the agency to ask their agent's\r\nassistance and advice. They said that the war-party was now completely\r\nunder their control, and they wished to know what they could do. They\r\nimplored the Great Father not to be angry with them, \"for they could not\r\ncontrol the war-party when they saw their friends killed by soldiers\r\nafter they had thrown down their bows and arrows and begged for life.\"\r\n\r\nIn October the agent reported that the Cheyennes were \"perfectly quiet\r\nand peaceable, and entirely within control, and obedient to authority.\"\r\nThe chiefs had organized a sort of police, whose duty was to kill any\r\nwar-parties that might attempt to leave the camp.\r\n\r\nThrough the winter the Cheyennes remained in the south and south-eastern\r\nparts of the agency, and strictly observed the conditions which their\r\nagent had imposed upon them. In the following August, however, a\r\nmilitary force under General Sumner was sent out \"to demand from the\r\ntribe the perpetrators of their late outrages on the whites, and ample\r\nsecurity for their good conduct.\" The Cheyennes were reported by General\r\nSumner as showing no disposition to yield to these demands; he therefore\r\nattacked them, burnt their village to the ground, and destroyed their\r\nwinter supplies—some fifteen or twenty thousand pounds of buffalo meat.\r\n\r\nOf how they lived, and where, during the winter following this fight,\r\nthere is little record. In the next year's reports the Cheyennes are\r\nsaid to be very anxious for a new treaty, which will assign to them a\r\ncountry in which they can dwell safely. \"They said they had learned a\r\nlesson last summer in their fight with General Sumner—that it was\r\nuseless to contend with the white man, who would soon with his villages\r\noccupy the whole prairie. They wanted peace; and as the buffalo—their\r\nprincipal dependence for food and clothing (which even now they were\r\ncompelled to seek many miles from home, where their natural enemies, the\r\nPawnee and Osage, roamed), would soon disappear entirely, they hoped\r\ntheir Great Father, the white chief at Washington, would listen to them,\r\nand give them a home where they might be provided for and protected\r\nagainst the encroachments of their white brothers, until at least they\r\nhad been taught to cultivate the soil and other arts of civilized life.\r\nThey have often desired ploughs and hoes, and to be taught their use.\"\r\n\r\nThe next year's records show the Government itself aware that some\r\nmeasures must be taken to provide for these troublesome wild tribes of\r\nthe prairie: almost more perplexing in time of peace than in time of war\r\nis the problem of the disposition to be made of them. Agents and\r\nsuperintendents alike are pressing on the Government's attention the\r\nfacts and the bearing of the rapid settling of the Indian lands by the\r\nwhites; the precariousness of peaceful relations; the dangers of Indian\r\nwars. The Indians themselves are deeply anxious and disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"They have heard that all of the Indian tribes to the eastward of them\r\nhave ceded their lands to the United States, except small reservations;\r\nand hence, by an Indian's reasoning, in a few years these tribes will\r\nemigrate farther west, and, as a matter of necessity, occupy the\r\nhunting-grounds of the wild tribes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the agent of the Upper Platte Agency tried to reason on this\r\nsubject with one of the Sioux chiefs, the chief said: \"When I was a\r\nyoung man, and I am not yet fifty, I travelled with my people through\r\nthe country of the Sac and Fox tribe, to the great water Minne Toukah\r\n(Mississippi), where I saw corn growing, but no white people; continuing\r\neastward, we came to the Rock River valley, and saw the Winnebagoes, but\r\nno white people. We then came to the Fox River valley, and thence to the\r\nGreat Lake (Lake Michigan), where we found a few white people in the\r\nPottawattomie country. Thence we returned to the Sioux country at the\r\nGreat Falls of Irara (St. Anthony), and had a feast of green corn with\r\nour relations, who resided there. Afterward we visited the pipe-clay\r\nquarry in the country of the Yankton Sioux, and made a feast to the\r\n'Great Medicine,' and danced the 'sun dance,' and then returned to our\r\nhunting-grounds on the prairie. And now our Father tells us the white\r\nman will never settle on our lands, and kill our game; but see! the\r\nwhites cover all of those lands I have just described, and also the\r\nlands of the Poncas, Omahas, and Pawnees. On the South Platte the white\r\npeople are finding gold, and the Cheyennes and Arapahoes have no longer\r\nany hunting-grounds. Our country has become very small, and before our\r\nchildren are grown up we shall have no game.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of this year (1859) an agent was sent to hold a council\r\nwith the Cheyennes and Arapahoes, and tell them of the wish of the\r\nGovernment that they should \"assume a fixed residence, and occupy\r\nthemselves in agriculture. This they at once received with favor, and\r\ndeclared with great unanimity to be acceptable to them. They expected\r\nand asked that the Department shall supply them with what is necessary\r\nto establish themselves permanently. *** Both these tribes had\r\nscrupulously maintained peaceful relations with the whites, and with\r\nother Indian tribes, notwithstanding the many causes of irritation\r\ngrowing out of the occupation of the gold region, and the emigration to\r\nit through their hunting-grounds, which are no longer reliable as a\r\ncertain source of food to them.\"\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that during the summer of 1859 over sixty thousand\r\nemigrants crossed these plains in their central belt. The trains of\r\nvehicles and cattle were frequent and valuable in proportion; and post\r\nlines and private expresses were in constant motion.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 a commissioner was sent out to hold a council with the Cheyennes\r\nand Arapahoes at Bent's Fort, on the Upper Arkansas, and make a treaty\r\nwith them. The Arapahoes were fully represented; but there were present\r\nonly two prominent chiefs of the Cheyennes—Black Kettle and White\r\nAntelope. (White Antelope was one of the chiefs brutally murdered five\r\nyears later in the Chivington massacre in Colorado.) As it was\r\nimpossible for the rest of the Cheyennes to reach the Fort in less than\r\ntwenty days, and the commissioner could not wait so long, Black Kettle\r\nand White Antelope wished it to be distinctly understood that they\r\npledged only themselves and their own bands.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner says: \"I informed them as to the object of my visit,\r\nand gave them to understand that their Great Father had heard with\r\ndelight of their peaceful disposition, although they were almost in the\r\nmidst of the hostile tribes. They expressed great pleasure on learning\r\nthat their Great Father had heard of their good conduct, and requested\r\nme to say, in return, that they intended in every respect to conform to\r\nthe wishes of the Government. I then presented to them a diagram of the\r\ncountry assigned them, by their treaty of 1851, as their\r\nhunting-grounds, which they seemed to understand perfectly, and were\r\nenabled without difficulty to give each initial point. In fact, they\r\nexhibited a degree of intelligence seldom to be found among tribes where\r\nno effort has been made to civilize them. I stated to them that it was\r\nthe intention of their Great Father to reduce the area of their present\r\nreservation, and that they should settle down and betake themselves to\r\nagriculture, and eventually abandon the chase as a means of support.\r\nThey informed me that such was their wish; and that they had been aware\r\nfor some time that they would be compelled to do so: that game was\r\ngrowing more scarce every year, and that they had also noticed the\r\napproach of whites, and felt that they must soon, in a great measure,\r\nconform to their habits. *** It has not fallen to my lot to visit any\r\nIndians who seem more disposed to yield to the wishes of the Government\r\nthan the Cheyennes and Arapahoes. Notwithstanding they are fully aware\r\nof the rich mines discovered in their country, they are disposed to\r\nyield up their claims without any reluctance. They certainly deserve the\r\nfostering hand of the Government, and should be liberally encouraged in\r\ntheir new sphere of life.\"\r\n\r\nThis treaty was concluded in February of the next year, at Fort Wise.\r\nThe chiefs of the Cheyennes and Arapahoes there \"ceded and relinquished\"\r\nall the lands to which they had any claim, \"wherever situated,\" except a\r\ncertain tract whose boundaries were defined. The land relinquished\r\nincluded lands in Kansas and Nebraska, and all of that part of Colorado\r\nwhich is north of the Arkansas, and east of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Cheyennes and Arapahoes, in \"consideration of their kind treatment\r\nby the citizens of Denver and the adjoining towns,\" \"respectfully\r\nrequested,\" in the eleventh Article of this treaty, that the United\r\nStates would permit the proprietors of these towns to enter their lands\r\nat the minimum price of one dollar and twenty-five cents an acre. This\r\nArticle was struck out by the Senate, and the Indians consented to the\r\namendment; but the proof of their good-will and gratitude remained on\r\nrecord, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nThe desire of the Government to make farmers of these Indians was\r\nreiterated in this treaty, and evidenced by pledges of purchase of\r\nstock, agricultural implements, etc.; mills, also, and mechanic shops\r\nthey were to have, and an annuity of $30,000 a year for fifteen years.\r\nThere was this clause, however, in an article of the treaty, \"Their\r\nannuities may, at the discretion of the President of the United States,\r\nbe discontinued entirely should said Indians fail to make reasonable and\r\nsatisfactory efforts to improve and advance their condition; in which\r\ncase such other provision shall be made for them as the President and\r\nCongress may judge to be suitable or proper.\" Could there be a more\r\ncomplete signing away than this of all benefits provided for by the\r\ntreaty?\r\n\r\nLands were to be assigned to them \"in severalty,\" and certificates were\r\nto be issued by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, specifying the names\r\nof individuals; and that the \"said tracts were set apart for the\r\nexclusive use and benefit of the assignees and their heirs.\" Each Indian\r\nwas to have forty acres of land, \"to include in every case, as far as\r\npracticable, a reasonable portion of timber and water.\"\r\n\r\nThe tenth Article of the treaty provided that the annuities now paid to\r\nthe Arapahoes and Cheyennes should be continued to them until the\r\nstipulations of such treaties or articles of agreement should be\r\nfulfilled; and the seventh Article provided that the President, with the\r\nassent of Congress, should have power to modify or change any \"of the\r\nprovisions of former treaties\" \"in such manner and to whatever extent\"\r\nhe might judge it to be necessary and expedient for their best\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nCould a community of people be delivered up more completely bound and at\r\nthe mercy of a government? Some of the bands of the Cheyennes who were\r\nnot represented at this council were much dissatisfied with the treaty,\r\nas evidently they had great reason to be. And as time went on, all the\r\nbands became dissatisfied. Two years later we find that, instead of\r\ntheir being settled on those farms \"in severalty,\" the survey of their\r\nlands has been just completed, and that \"a contract will soon be made\r\nfor the construction of a ditch for the purpose of irrigating their\r\narable land.\" \"It is to be hoped,\" the Superintendent of the Colorado\r\nAgency writes, that \"when suitable preparations for their subsistence by\r\nagriculture and grazing are made, these tribes will gradually cease\r\ntheir roaming, and become permanently settled.\" It would seem highly\r\nprobable that under those conditions the half-starved creatures would be\r\nonly too glad to cease to roam. It is now ten years since they were\r\nreported to be in a condition of miserable starvation every winter,\r\ntrying to raise a little corn here and there, and begging to have a\r\nfarmer and a blacksmith sent out to them. They are now divided and\r\nsubdivided into small bands, hunting the buffalo wherever they can find\r\nhim, and going in small parties because there are no longer large herds\r\nof buffaloes to be found anywhere. The Governor of Colorado says, in his\r\nreport for 1863, that \"these extensive subdivisions of the tribes caused\r\ngreat difficulty in ascertaining the really guilty parties in the\r\ncommission of offences.\" Depredations and hostilities are being\r\nfrequently committed, but it is manifestly unjust to hold the whole\r\ntribe responsible for the acts of a few.\r\n\r\nThings grew rapidly worse in Colorado. Those \"preparations for their\r\nsubsistence by agriculture and grazing\"—which it took so much room to\r\ntell in the treaty—not having been made; the farmer, and the blacksmith,\r\nand the grist-mill not having arrived; the contract not having been even\r\nlet for the irrigating-ditch, without which no man can raise any crops\r\nin Colorado, not even on arable lands—many of the Cheyennes and\r\nArapahoes took to a system of pilfering reprisals from emigrant trains,\r\nand in the fights resulting from this effort to steal they committed\r\nmany terrible murders. All the tribes on the plains were more or less\r\nengaged in these outrages; and it was evident, before midsummer of 1864,\r\nthat the Government must interfere with a strong hand to protect the\r\nemigrants and Western settlers—to protect them from the consequences of\r\nits own bad faith with the Indians. The Governor of Colorado called for\r\nmilitary aid, and for authority to make a campaign against the Indians,\r\nwhich was given him. But as there was no doubt that many of the Indians\r\nwere still peaceable and loyal, and he desired to avoid every\r\npossibility of their sharing in the punishment of the guilty, he issued\r\na proclamation in June, requesting all who were friendly to come to\r\nplaces which he designated, where they were to be assured of safety and\r\nprotection. This proclamation was sent to all the Indians of the plains.\r\nIn consequence of it, several bands of friendly Arapahoes and Cheyennes\r\ncame to Fort Lyon, and were there received by the officer in charge,\r\nrationed, and assured of safety. Here there occurred, on the 29th of\r\nNovember, one of the foulest massacres which the world has seen. This\r\ncamp of friendly Indians was surprised at daybreak, and men, women, and\r\nchildren were butchered in cold blood. Most of those who escaped fled to\r\nthe north, and, joining other bands of the tribe, proceeded at once to\r\ntake most fearful, and, it must be said, natural revenge. A terrible war\r\nfollowed. Some of them confederated with the Sioux, and waged relentless\r\nwar on all the emigrant routes across the plains. These hostilities were\r\nbitter in proportion to the bitterness of resentment felt by the\r\nrefugees from this massacre. \"It will be long before faith in the honor\r\nand humanity of the whites can be re-established in the minds of these\r\nbarbarians,\" says an official report, \"and the last Indian who escaped\r\nfrom the brutal scene at Sand Creek will probably have died before its\r\neffects will have disappeared.\"[10]\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Arts. I. and XI.\r\n\r\nIn October of the next year some of the bands, having first had their\r\nsafety assured by an old and tried friend, I. H. Leavenworth, Indian\r\nAgent for the Upper Arkansas, gathered together to hold a council with\r\nUnited States Commissioners on the Little Arkansas. The commissioners\r\nwere empowered by the President to restore to the survivors of the Sand\r\nCreek massacre full value for all the property then destroyed; \"to make\r\nreparation,\" so far as possible. To each woman who had lost a husband\r\nthere they gave one hundred and sixty acres of land; to each child who\r\nhad lost a parent, the same. Probably even an Indian woman would\r\nconsider one hundred and sixty acres of land a poor equivalent for a\r\nmurdered husband; but the offers were accepted in good part by the\r\ntribe, and there is nothing in all the history of this patient race more\r\npathetic than the calm and reasonable language employed by some of these\r\nCheyenne and Arapahoe chiefs at this council. Said Black Kettle, the\r\nchief over whose lodge the American flag, with a white flag tied below,\r\nwas floating at the time of the massacre, \"I once thought that I was the\r\nonly man that persevered to be the friend of the white man; but since\r\nthey have come and cleaned out our lodges, horses, and everything else,\r\nit is hard for me to believe white men any more. *** All my friends, the\r\nIndians that are holding back, they are afraid to come in; are afraid\r\nthat they will be betrayed as I have been. I am not afraid of white men,\r\nbut come and take you by the hand.\" Elsewhere, Black Kettle spoke of\r\nColonel Chivington's troops as \"that fool-band of soldiers that cleared\r\nout our lodges, and killed our women and children. This is hard on us.\"\r\nWith a magnanimity and common-sense which white men would have done well\r\nto imitate in their judgments of the Indians, he recognized that it\r\nwould be absurd, as well as unjust, to hold all white men in distrust on\r\naccount of the acts of that \"fool-band of soldiers.\"[11]\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Gen. Harney, on being asked by Bishop Whipple if Black Kettle were a\r\n  hostile Indian, replied, laying his hand on his heart, \"I have worn\r\n  this uniform fifty-five years. He was as true a friend of the white\r\n  man as I am.\"\r\n\r\nBy the terms of this treaty, a new reservation was to be set apart for\r\nthe Cheyennes and Arapahoes; hostile acts on either side were to be\r\nsettled by arbitration; no whites were to be allowed on the reservation;\r\na large tract of country was to be \"relinquished\" by the Indians, but\r\nthey were \"expressly permitted to reside upon and range at pleasure\r\nthroughout the unsettled portions of that part of the country they claim\r\nas originally theirs.\" The United States reserved the right to build\r\nroads and establish forts in the reservation, and pledged itself to pay\r\n\"annually, for the period of forty years,\" certain sums of money to each\r\nperson in the tribe: twenty dollars a head till they were settled on\r\ntheir reservation; after that, forty dollars a head. To this end an\r\naccurate annual census of the Indians was promised at the time of the\r\nannuity payment in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe Indians went away from this council full of hope and satisfaction.\r\nTheir oldest friends, Colonel Bent and Kit Carson, were among the\r\ncommissioners, and they felt that at last they had a treaty they could\r\ntrust. Their old reservation in Colorado (to which they probably could\r\nnever have been induced to return) was restored to the public domain of\r\nthat territory, and they hoped in their new home for greater safety and\r\npeace. The Apaches, who had heretofore been allied with the Kiowas and\r\nComanches, were now allied with them, and to have the benefits of the\r\nnew treaty. A small portion of the tribe—chiefly young men of a\r\nturbulent nature—still held aloof, and refused to come under the treaty\r\nprovisions. One riotous band, called the Dog Soldiers, were especially\r\nrefractory; but, before the end of the next year, they also decided to\r\ngo southward and join the rest of the tribe on the new reservation.\r\nOccasional hostilities took place in the course of the winter, one of\r\nwhich it is worth while to relate, the incident is so typical a one.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of February a son of one Mr. Boggs was killed and scalped by\r\na party of four Cheyenne Indians about six miles east of Fort Dodge, on\r\nthe Arkansas River. On investigation, it appeared that Mr. Boggs had\r\ngone to the Indian camp without any authority, and had there traded off\r\neleven one-dollar bills for ten-dollar bills. The Indian on whom this\r\ntrick had been played found Mr. Boggs out, went to him, and demanded\r\nreparation; and, in the altercation and fight which ensued, Mr. Boggs's\r\nson was killed. This story is given in the official report of\r\nLieutenant-colonel Gordon, U.S.A., and Colonel Gordon adds, \"I think\r\nthis case needs no further comment.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cheyennes did not long remain at peace; in the summer the Senate had\r\nadded to this last treaty an amendment requiring their new reservation\r\nto be entirely \"outside the State of Kansas, and not within any Indian\r\nterritory, except on consent of the tribes interested.\" As the\r\nreservation had been partly in Kansas, and partly on the lands of the\r\nCherokees, this amendment left them literally without any home whatever.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the young men of the tribe soon began to join\r\nagain with other hostile Indians in committing depredations and\r\nhostilities along the great mail-routes on the plains. Again they were\r\nvisited with summary and apparently deserved vengeance by the United\r\nStates troops, and in the summer of 1867 a Cheyenne village numbering\r\nthree hundred lodges was burnt by United States soldiers under General\r\nHancock. Fortunately the women and children had all fled on the first\r\nnews of the approach of the army. Soon after this another council was\r\nheld with them, and once more the precarious peace was confirmed by\r\ntreaty; but was almost immediately broken again in consequence of the\r\nfailure of the Government to comply with the treaty provisions. That\r\nsome members of these tribes had also failed to keep to the treaty\r\nprovisions is undoubtedly true, but by far the greater part of them were\r\nloyal and peaceable. \"The substantial cause of this war,\" however, was\r\nacknowledged by the Indian Bureau itself to be \"the fact that the\r\nDepartment, for want of appropriations, was compelled to stop their\r\nsupplies, and to permit them to recur to the chase for subsistence.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1868 \"the country bounded east by the State of Arkansas, south by\r\nTexas, north by Kansas, and west by the hundredth meridian of longitude,\r\nwas set apart for the exclusive use of the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Kiowas,\r\nand Comanches, and such other bands as might be located there by proper\r\nauthority;\" and the whole was declared to constitute \"a military\r\ndistrict,\" under command of Major-general Hazen, U.S.A. In October of\r\nthe same year Major Wynkoop, who had been the faithful friend of the\r\nCheyennes and Arapahoes ever since the days of Sand Creek, published his\r\nlast protest in their behalf, in a letter to the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs. He says that the failure of the Government to fulfil treaty\r\nprovisions in the matter of supplies forced them to resort to hunting\r\nagain; and then the refusal of the Government to give them the arms and\r\nammunition promised in the treaty, left them without any means of\r\nsecuring the game; hence the depredations. The chiefs had promised to\r\ndeliver up the guilty ones to Major Wynkoop, \"but before sufficient time\r\nhad elapsed for them to fulfil their promises the troops were in the\r\nfield, and the Indians in flight. *** Even after the majority of the\r\nCheyennes had been forced to take the war-path, in consequence of the\r\nbad acts of some of their nation, several bands of the Cheyennes, and\r\nthe whole Arapahoe tribe, could have been kept at peace had proper\r\naction been taken at the time; but now all the Indians of the Upper\r\nArkansas are engaged in the struggle.\"[12]\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  On October 27th of this year Black Kettle and his entire band were\r\n  killed by Gen. Custer's command at Antelope Hills, on the Wichita\r\n  River.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 many Arapahoes and Cheyennes had made their way to Montana, and\r\nwere living with the Gros Ventres; most of those who remained at the\r\nsouth were quiet, and seemed to be disposed to observe the provisions of\r\nthe treaty, but were earnestly imploring to be moved farther to the\r\nnorth, where they might hunt buffalo.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, under the care of an agent of the Society of Friends, the\r\nimprovement of the Southern Cheyennes was remarkable. Buildings were put\r\nup, land was broken and planted, and the agent reports that, \"with\r\nproper care on the part of the Government,\" there will not be any\r\n\"serious trouble\" with the tribe, although there are still some\r\n\"restless spirits\" among them.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 the Cheyennes and Arapahoes are reported as \"allied to the\r\nGovernment in the maintenance of peace on the border. Very strong\r\ninducements have been made by the raiding bands of Kiowas, at critical\r\ntimes in the past two years, to join them in hostile alliance in raids\r\nagainst the whites; but all such appeals have been rejected, and, as a\r\ntribe, they have remained loyal and peaceful.\"\r\n\r\nThirty lodges of the Northern Cheyennes returned this year and joined\r\ntheir tribe, but many of them were still roaming among the Northern\r\nSioux. In 1874 there were said to be over three thousand of these\r\nNorthern Cheyennes and Arapahoes at the Red Cloud Agency. The Government\r\nrefused any longer to permit them to stay there; and, after repeated\r\nprotests, and expressions of unwillingness to move, they at last\r\nconsented to go to the Indian Territory. But their removal was deferred,\r\non account of the unsettled state of the Southern Cheyennes. Early in\r\nthe spring troubles had broken out among them, in consequence of a raid\r\nof horse-thieves on their reservation. The chief, Little Robe, lost\r\nforty-three head of valuable ponies. These ponies were offered for sale\r\nin Dodge City, Kansas, where Little Robe's son, with a small band of\r\nyoung men, made an unsuccessful effort to reclaim them. Failing in this,\r\nthe band, on their way back, stole the first stock they came to; were\r\npursued by the Kansas farmers, the stock recaptured, and Little Robe's\r\nson badly wounded. This was sufficient to bring on a general war against\r\nwhite men in the whole region; and the history of the next few months\r\nwas a history of murders and outrages by Cheyennes, Kiowas, Osages, and\r\nComanches. Sixty lodges of the Cheyennes took refuge under the\r\nprotection of the United States troops at the agency, and the old\r\nproblem returned again, how to punish the guilty without harming the\r\ninnocent. A vigorous military campaign was carried on under General\r\nMiles against the hostiles until, in the spring of 1875, the main body\r\nsurrendered. Wretched, half starved, more than half naked, without\r\nlodges, ponies—a more pitiable sight was never seen than this band of\r\nIndians. It was inconceivable how they had so long held out; nothing but\r\na well-nigh indomitable pride and inextinguishable hatred of the whites\r\nand sense of wrongs could have supported them. It was decided that\r\nthirty-three of the most desperate ones should be sent as prisoners to\r\nSt. Augustine, Florida; but before the selection was completed a general\r\nstampede among the surrendered braves took place, resulting in the final\r\nescape of some four hundred. They held their ground from two P.M. until\r\ndark against three companies of cavalry and two Gatling guns, and,\r\n\"under cover of an extremely dark and stormy night, escaped, leaving\r\nonly three dead on the field.\" It is impossible not to admire such\r\nbravery as this. The Report of the Indian Bureau for 1875 says of the\r\ncondition of affairs at this agency at this time: \"The friendly\r\nCheyennes have had their loyalty put to the severest test by comparing\r\ntheir own condition with that of the full-fed and warmly-housed captives\r\nof the War Department. Notwithstanding all privations, they have been\r\nunswerving in their friendship, and ever ready to assist the agent in\r\nmaintaining order, and compelling the Northern Cheyennes who have\r\nvisited the agency to submit to a count.\" In consequence of the\r\nhostilities, they were obliged to remain close to the agency in camp—a\r\nhardship that could hardly be endured, and resulted in serious\r\nsuffering. Their rations were not enough to subsist them, and yet, being\r\ncut off from hunting, they were entirely dependent on them. And even\r\nthese inadequate rations did not arrive when they were due. Their agent\r\nwrites, in 1875: \"On last year's flour contract not a single pound was\r\nreceived until the fourteenth day of First Month, 1875, when six months\r\nof cold weather and many privations had passed, notwithstanding the many\r\nprotestations and urgent appeals from the agent.\"\r\n\r\nThe now thoroughly subjugated Cheyennes went to work with a will. In one\r\nshort year they are reported as so anxious to cultivate the ground that,\r\nwhen they could not secure the use of a plough or hoe, they used \"axes,\r\nsticks of wood, and their hands, in preparing the ground, planting and\r\ncultivating their garden spots.\"\r\n\r\nThe Northern Cheyennes are still on the Red Cloud Agency, and are\r\nreported as restless and troublesome.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 they were all removed to the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Agency, in\r\nIndian Territory. The Reports of the Department say that they asked to\r\nbe taken there. The winter of 1866 and the summer of 1867 were seasons\r\nof great activity and interest at this agency. In the autumn they went\r\noff on a grand buffalo hunt, accompanied by a small detail of troops\r\nfrom Fort Reno. Early in the winter white horse-thieves began to make\r\nraids on their ponies, and stole so many that many of the Indians were\r\nobliged to depend on their friends' ponies to help them return home. Two\r\nhundred and sixty in all were stolen—carried, as usual, to Dodge City\r\nand sold. A few were recovered; but the loss to the Indians was\r\nestimated at two thousand nine hundred dollars. \"Such losses are very\r\ndiscouraging to the Indians,\" writes their agent, and are \"but a\r\nrepetition of the old story that brought on the war of 1874.\"\r\n\r\nIn midsummer of this year the \"Cheyenne and Arapahoe Transportation\r\nCompany\" was formed: forty wagons were sent out, with harness, by the\r\nGovernment; the Indians furnished the horses; and on the 19th of July\r\nthe Indians set out in their new _rôle_ of \"freighters\" of their own\r\nsupplies. They went to Wichita, Kansas—one hundred and sixty-five\r\nmiles—in six days, with their ponies; loaded sixty-five thousand pounds\r\nof supplies into the wagons, and made the return trip in two weeks, all\r\nthings being delivered in good condition.\r\n\r\nThis experiment was thoroughly tested; and its results are notable among\r\nthe many unheeded refutations of the constantly repeated assertion that\r\nIndians will not work. The agent of the Cheyennes and the Arapahoes,\r\ntestifying before a Senate Committee in 1879, says: \"We have run a wagon\r\ntrain, driven by Indians, to Wichita, for three years and over, and have\r\nnever had a drunken Indian yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they waste their money, or bring it home?\"\r\n\r\n\"They almost invariably spend it for saddles or clothing, or something\r\nof use to them that is not furnished by the Government. *** They have\r\nnever stolen an ounce of sugar, coffee, or anything else: they have been\r\ncareful not to injure or waste anything, and have delivered everything\r\nin good faith.\"\r\n\r\nThe agent reports not a single case of drunkenness during the year. The\r\nmanual labor and boarding-school has one hundred and thirteen scholars\r\nin it, \"all it can accommodate.\" The children earned four hundred\r\ndollars in the year by work of one sort and another, and have \"expended\r\nthe money as judiciously as would white children of their ages.\" They\r\nbought calico, cotton cloth, shoes, hats, several head of cattle, and\r\none horse. They also \"bought many delicacies for their friends in camp\r\nwho were sick and in need.\"\r\n\r\n\"One Cheyenne woman tanned robes, traded them for twenty-five\r\ntwo-year-old heifers, and gave them to her daughter in the school. ***\r\nThe boys have one hundred and twenty acres of corn under cultivation,\r\nten acres of potatoes, broom-corn, sugar-cane, peanuts, melons, and a\r\ngood variety of vegetables. They are entitled to one-half the crop for\r\ncultivating it.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a marvellous report of the change wrought in a people in only\r\ntwo years' time. It proves that the misdemeanors, the hostilities of\r\n1874 and 1875, had been largely forced on them by circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1877 and summer of 1878 were terrible seasons for the\r\nCheyennes. Their fall hunt had proved unsuccessful. Indians from other\r\nreservations had hunted the ground over before them, and driven the\r\nbuffalo off; and the Cheyennes made their way home again in straggling\r\nparties, destitute and hungry. Their agent reports that the result of\r\nthis hunt has clearly proved that \"in the future the Indian must rely on\r\ntilling the ground as the principal means of support; and if this\r\nconviction can be firmly established, the greatest obstacle to\r\nadvancement in agriculture will be overcome. With the buffalo gone, and\r\ntheir pony herds being constantly decimated by the inroads of\r\nhorse-thieves, they must soon adopt, in all its varieties, the way of\r\nthe white man. *** The usual amount of horse-stealing has prevailed, and\r\nthe few cases of successful pursuit have only increased the boldness of\r\nthe thieves and the number of the thefts. Until some other system of law\r\nis introduced we cannot hope for a cessation of this grievance.\"\r\n\r\nThe ration allowed to these Indians is reported as being \"reduced and\r\ninsufficient,\" and the small sums they have been able to earn by selling\r\nbuffalo-hides are said to have been \"of material assistance\" to them in\r\n\"supplementing\" this ration. But in this year there have been sold only\r\n$657 worth of skins by the Cheyennes and Arapahoes together. In 1876\r\nthey sold $17,600 worth. Here is a falling off enough to cause very\r\ngreat suffering in a little community of five thousand people. But this\r\nwas only the beginning of their troubles. The summer proved one of\r\nunusual heat. Extreme heat, chills and fever, and \"a reduced and\r\ninsufficient ration,\" all combined, resulted in an amount of sickness\r\nheart-rending to read of. \"It is no exaggerated estimate,\" says the\r\nagent, \"to place the number of sick people on the reservation at two\r\nthousand. Many deaths occurred which might have been obviated had there\r\nbeen a proper supply of anti-malarial remedies at hand. *** Hundreds\r\napplying for treatment have been refused medicine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Northern Cheyennes grew more and more restless and unhappy. \"In\r\ncouncil and elsewhere they profess an intense desire to be sent North,\r\nwhere they say they will settle down as the others have done,\" says the\r\nreport; adding, with an obtuseness which is inexplicable, that \"no\r\ndifference has been made in the treatment of the Indians,\" but that the\r\n\"compliance\" of these Northern Cheyennes has been \"of an entirely\r\ndifferent nature from that of the other Indians,\" and that it may be\r\n\"necessary in the future to compel what so far we have been unable to\r\neffect by kindness and appeal to their better natures.\"\r\n\r\nIf it is \"an appeal to men's better natures\" to remove them by force\r\nfrom a healthful Northern climate, which they love and thrive in, to a\r\nmalarial Southern one, where they are struck down by chills and\r\nfever—refuse them medicine which can combat chills and fever, and\r\nfinally starve them—then, indeed, might be said to have been most\r\nforcible appeals made to the \"better natures\" of these Northern\r\nCheyennes. What might have been predicted followed.\r\n\r\nEarly in the autumn, after this terrible summer, a band of some three\r\nhundred of these Northern Cheyennes took the desperate step of running\r\noff and attempting to make their way back to Dakota. They were pursued,\r\nfought desperately, but were finally overpowered, and surrendered. They\r\nsurrendered, however, only on the condition that they should be taken to\r\nDakota. They were unanimous in declaring that they would rather die than\r\ngo back to the Indian Territory. This was nothing more, in fact, than\r\nsaying that they would rather die by bullets than of chills and fever\r\nand starvation.\r\n\r\nThese Indians were taken to Fort Robinson, Nebraska. Here they were\r\nconfined as prisoners of war, and held subject to the orders of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior. The department was informed of the Indians'\r\ndetermination never to be taken back alive to Indian Territory. The army\r\nofficers in charge reiterated these statements, and implored the\r\ndepartment to permit them to remain at the North; but it was of no\r\navail. Orders came—explicit, repeated, finally stern—insisting on the\r\nreturn of these Indians to their agency. The commanding officer at Fort\r\nRobinson has been censured severely for the course he pursued in his\r\neffort to carry out those orders. It is difficult to see what else he\r\ncould have done, except to have resigned his post. He could not take\r\nthree hundred Indians by sheer brute force and carry them hundreds of\r\nmiles, especially when they were so desperate that they had broken up\r\nthe iron stoves in their quarters, and wrought and twisted them into\r\nweapons with which to resist. He thought perhaps he could starve them\r\ninto submission. He stopped the issue of food; he also stopped the issue\r\nof fuel to them. It was midwinter; the mercury froze in that month at\r\nFort Robinson. At the end of two days he asked the Indians to let their\r\nwomen and children come out that he might feed them. Not a woman would\r\ncome out. On the night of the fourth day—or, according to some accounts,\r\nthe sixth—these starving, freezing Indians broke prison, overpowered the\r\nguards, and fled, carrying their women and children with them. They held\r\nthe pursuing troops at bay for several days; finally made a last stand\r\nin a deep ravine, and were shot down—men, women, and children together.\r\nOut of the whole band there were left alive some fifty women and\r\nchildren and seven men, who, having been confined in another part of the\r\nfort, had not had the good fortune to share in this outbreak and meet\r\ntheir death in the ravine. These, with their wives and children, were\r\nsent to Fort Leavenworth, to be put in prison; the men to be tried for\r\nmurders committed in their skirmishes in Kansas on their way to the\r\nnorth. Red Cloud, a Sioux chief, came to Fort Robinson immediately after\r\nthis massacre, and entreated to be allowed to take the Cheyenne widows\r\nand orphans into his tribe to be cared for. The Government, therefore,\r\nkindly permitted twenty-two Cheyenne widows and thirty-two Cheyenne\r\nchildren—many of them orphans—to be received into the band of the\r\nOgallalla Sioux.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in his Report\r\nfor 1879, to show by tables and figures that these Indians were not\r\nstarving at the time of their flight from Indian Territory. The attempt\r\nonly redounded to his own disgrace; it being proved, by the testimony\r\ngiven by a former clerk of the Indian Bureau before the Senate committee\r\nappointed to investigate the case of the Northern Cheyennes, that the\r\ncommissioner had been guilty of absolute dishonesty in his estimates,\r\nand that the quantity of beef actually issued to the Cheyenne Agency was\r\nhundreds of pounds less than he had reported it, and that the Indians\r\nwere actually, as they had claimed, \"starving.\"\r\n\r\nThe testimony given before this committee by some of the Cheyenne\r\nprisoners themselves is heart-rending. One must have a callous heart who\r\ncan read it unmoved.\r\n\r\nWhen asked by Senator Morgan, \"Did you ever really suffer from hunger?\"\r\none of the chiefs replied, \"We were _always_ hungry; we _never_ had\r\nenough. When they that were sick once in awhile felt as though they\r\ncould eat something, we had nothing to give them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not go out on the plains sometimes and hunt buffalo, with the\r\nconsent of the agent?\"\r\n\r\n\"We went out on a buffalo-hunt, and nearly starved while out; we could\r\nnot find any buffalo hardly; we could hardly get back with our ponies;\r\nwe had to kill a good many of our ponies to eat, to save ourselves from\r\nstarving.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many children got sick and died?\"\r\n\r\n\"Between the fall of 1877 and 1878 we lost fifty children. A great many\r\nof our finest young men died, as well as many women.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Crow,\" a chief who served faithfully as Indian scout and ally under\r\nGeneral Crook for years, said: \"I did not feel like doing anything for\r\nawhile, because I had no heart. I did not want to be in this country. I\r\nwas all the time wanting to get back to the better country where I was\r\nborn, and where my children are buried, and where my mother and sister\r\nyet live. So I have laid in my lodge most of the time with nothing to\r\nthink about but that, and the affair up north at Fort Robinson, and my\r\nrelatives and friends who were killed there. But now I feel as though,\r\nif I had a wagon and a horse or two, and some land, I would try to work.\r\nIf I had something, so that I could do something, I might not think so\r\nmuch about these other things. As it is now, I feel as though I would\r\njust as soon be asleep with the rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe wife of one of the chiefs confined at Fort Leavenworth testified\r\nbefore the committee as follows: \"The main thing I complained of was\r\nthat we didn't get enough to eat; my children nearly starved to death;\r\nthen sickness came, and there was nothing good for them to eat; for a\r\nlong time the most they had to eat was corn-meal and salt. Three or four\r\nchildren died every day for awhile, and that frightened us.\"\r\n\r\n(This testimony was taken at Fort Reno, in Indian Territory.)\r\n\r\nWhen asked if there were anything she would like to say to the\r\ncommittee, the poor woman replied: \"I wish you would do what you can to\r\nget my husband released. I am very poor here, and do not know what is to\r\nbecome of me. If he were released he would come down here, and we would\r\nlive together quietly, and do no harm to anybody, and make no trouble.\r\nBut I should never get over my desire to get back north; I should always\r\nwant to get back where my children were born, and died, and were buried.\r\nThat country is better than this in every respect. *** There is plenty\r\nof good, cool water there—pure water—while here the water is not good.\r\nIt is not hot there, nor so sickly. Are you going where my husband is?\r\nCan you tell when he is likely to be released?\"\r\n\r\nThe Senators were obliged to reply to her that they were not going where\r\nher husband was, and they could not tell when he would be released.\r\n\r\nIn view of the accounts of the sickness and suffering of these Indians\r\nin 1877 and 1878, the reports made in 1879 of the industry and progress\r\nat the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Agency are almost incredible. The school\r\nchildren have, by their earnings, bought one hundred head of cattle;\r\n451,000 pounds of freight have been transported by the Indians during\r\nthe year; they have also worked at making brick, chopping wood, making\r\nhay, hauling wood, and splitting and hauling rails; and have earned\r\nthereby $7,121.25. Two of the girls of the school have been promoted to\r\nthe position of assistant teachers; and the United States mail\r\ncontractor between this agency and Fort Elliott, in Texas—a distance of\r\none hundred and sixty-five miles—has operated almost exclusively with\r\nfull-blooded Indians: \"there has been no report of breach of trust on\r\nthe part of any Indians connected with this trust, and the contractor\r\nexpresses his entire approval of their conduct.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated also that there was not sufficient clothing to furnish each\r\nIndian with a warm suit of clothing, \"as promised by the treaty,\" and\r\nthat, \"by reference to official correspondence, the fact is established\r\nthat the Cheyennes and Arapahoes are judged as having no legal rights to\r\nany lands, having forfeited their treaty reservation by a failure to\r\nsettle thereon,\" and their \"present reservation not having been, as yet,\r\nconfirmed by Congress. Inasmuch as the Indians fully understood, and\r\nwere assured that this reservation was given to them in lieu of their\r\ntreaty reservation, and have commenced farming in the belief that there\r\nwas no uncertainty about the matter, it is but common justice that\r\ndefinite action be had at an early day, securing to them what is their\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem that there could be found nowhere in the melancholy record\r\nof the experiences of our Indians a more glaring instance of confused\r\nmultiplication of injustices than this. The Cheyennes were pursued and\r\nslain for venturing to leave this very reservation, which, it appears,\r\nis not their reservation at all, and they have no legal right to it. Are\r\nthere any words to fitly characterize such treatment as this from a\r\ngreat, powerful, rich nation, to a handful of helpless people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                            THE NEZ PERCÉS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBounded on the north, south, and east by snow-topped mountains, and on\r\nthe west by shining waters; holding in its rocky passes the sources of\r\nsix great rivers; bearing on its slopes and plains measureless forests\r\nof pine and cedar and spruce; its meadows gardens of summer bloom and\r\nfruit, and treasure-houses of fertility,—lies Oregon: wide, healthful,\r\nbeautiful, abundant, and inviting, no wonder it was coveted and fought\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nWhen Lewis and Clarke visited it, eighty years ago, they found living\r\nthere many tribes of Indians, numbering in all, at the lowest estimates,\r\nbetween twenty and thirty thousand; of all these tribes the Nez Percés\r\nwere the richest, noblest, and most gentle.\r\n\r\nTo the Cayuses, one of the most warlike of these tribes, Messrs. Lewis\r\nand Clarke presented an American flag, telling them it was an emblem of\r\npeace. The gay coloring and beauty of the flag, allied to this\r\nsignificance, made a deep impression on the poetic minds of these\r\nsavages. They set the flag up in a beautiful valley called the Grande\r\nRonde—a fertile basin some twenty-five miles in diameter, surrounded by\r\nhigh walls of basaltic rock, and watered by a branch of the Snake River:\r\naround this flag they met their old enemies the Shoshones, and swore to\r\nkeep perpetual peace with them; and the spot became consecrated to an\r\nannual meeting of the tribes—a sort of fair, where the Cayuse, Nez\r\nPercé, and Walla Walla Indians came every summer and traded their roots,\r\nskins, elk and buffalo meats, for salmon and horses, with the Shoshones.\r\nIt was a beautiful spot, nearly circular, luxuriantly covered with\r\ngrass, the hill wall around it thick grown with evergreen trees, chiefly\r\nlarch. The Indians called it Karpkarp, which being translated is \"Balm\r\nof Gilead.\"\r\n\r\nThe life of these Indians was a peculiar one. Most of them had several\r\nhomes, and as they lived only a part of the year in each, were\r\nfrequently spoken of by travellers as nomadic tribes, while in fact they\r\nwere as wedded to their homes as any civilized inhabitants of the world;\r\nand their wanderings were as systematic as the removals of wealthy city\r\npeople from town homes to country places. If a man were rich enough, and\r\nfond enough of change, to have a winter house in New York, a house for\r\nthe summer in Newport, and one for autumn in the White Mountains, nobody\r\nwould think of calling him a nomad; still less if he made these\r\nsuccessive changes annually, with perfect regularity, owing to\r\nopportunities which were offered him at regularly recurring intervals in\r\nthese different places to earn his living; which was the case with the\r\nOregon Indians.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the snow disappears in the spring there is in certain\r\nlocalities, ready for gathering, the \"pohpoh\"—a small bulb, like an\r\nonion. This is succeeded by the \"spatlam,\" and the \"spatlam\" by the\r\n\"cammass\" or \"ithwa,\" a root like a parsnip, which they make into fine\r\nmeal. In midsummer come the salmon in countless shoals up the rivers.\r\nAugust is the month for berries, of which they dry great quantities for\r\nwinter use. In September salmon again—coming down stream now, exhausted\r\nand ready to die, but in sufficiently good condition to be dried for the\r\nwinter. In October comes the \"mesani,\" another root of importance in the\r\nIndian larder. After this they must depend on deer, bears, small game,\r\nand wild-fowl. When all these resources fail, there is a kind of lichen\r\ngrowing on the trees, of which they can eat enough to keep themselves\r\nfrom starving, though its nutritive qualities are very small. Thus each\r\nseason had its duty and its appointed place of abode, and year after\r\nyear the same month found them in the same spot.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 a delegation from these Oregon Indians went to St. Louis, and\r\nthrough Mr. Catlin, the artist, made known their object, which was \"to\r\ninquire for the truth of a representation which they said some white\r\nmen had made among them, that our religion was better than theirs, and\r\nthat they would all be lost if they did not embrace it.\" Two members\r\nof this delegation were Nez Percés—\"Hee-oh'ks-te-kin\" and\r\n\"H'co-a-h'co-a-h'cotes-min,\" or \"Rabbit-skin Leggings,\" and \"No Horns\r\non his Head.\" Their portraits are to be found in \"Catlin's American\r\nIndians.\" One of these died on his way home; but the other journeyed\r\nhis thousands of miles safely back, and bore to his tribe the news\r\n\"that the report which they had heard was well founded, and that good\r\nand religious men would soon come among them to teach this religion,\r\nso that they could all understand and have the benefits of it.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later the Methodist Episcopal Society and the American Board\r\nboth sent missionaries to Oregon. Before this the religion of the\r\nfur-traders was the only white man's religion that the Indians had had\r\nthe opportunity of observing. Eleven different companies and\r\nexpeditions, besides the Hudson's Bay and the North-west Companies, had\r\nbeen established in their country, and the Indians had become only too\r\nfamiliar with their standards and methods. It was not many years after\r\nthe arrival of the missionaries in Oregon that a traveller there gave\r\nthe following account of his experience with a Nez Percé guide:\r\n\r\n\"Creekie (so he was named) was a very kind man; he turned my worn-out\r\nanimals loose, and loaded my packs on his own; gave me a splendid horse\r\nto ride, and intimated by significant gestures that we would go a short\r\ndistance that afternoon. I gave my assent, and we were soon on our way;\r\nhaving ridden about ten miles, we camped for the night. I noticed,\r\nduring the ride, a degree of forbearance toward each other which I had\r\nnever before observed in that race. When we halted for the night the two\r\nboys were behind; they had been frolicking with their horses, and, as\r\nthe darkness came on, lost the trail. It was a half-hour before they\r\nmade their appearance, and during this time the parents manifested the\r\nmost anxious solicitude for them. One of them was but three years old,\r\nand was lashed to the horse he rode; the other only seven years of\r\nage—young pilots in the wilderness at night. But the elder, true to the\r\nsagacity of his race, had taken his course, and struck the brook on\r\nwhich we were encamped within three hundred yards of us. The pride of\r\nthe parents at this feat, and their ardent attachment to the children,\r\nwere perceptible in the pleasure with which they received them at their\r\nevening fire, and heard the relation of their childish adventures. The\r\nweather was so pleasant that no tent was spread. The willows were bent,\r\nand the buffalo-robes spread over them. Underneath were laid other\r\nrobes, on which my Indian host seated himself, with his wife and\r\nchildren on one side and myself on the other. A fire burnt brightly in\r\nfront. Water was brought, and the evening ablutions having been\r\nperformed, the wife presented a dish of meat to her husband and one to\r\nmyself. There was a pause. The woman seated herself between her\r\nchildren. The Indian then bowed his head and prayed to God. A wandering\r\nsavage in Oregon, calling on Jehovah in the name of Jesus Christ! After\r\nthe prayer he gave meat to his children and passed the dish to his wife.\r\nWhile eating, the frequent repetition of the words Jehovah and Jesus\r\nChrist, in the most reverential manner, led me to suppose that they were\r\nconversing on religious topics, and thus they passed an hour. Meanwhile\r\nthe exceeding weariness of a long day's travel admonished me to seek\r\nrest. I had slumbered I know not how long, when a strain of music awoke\r\nme. The Indian family was engaged in its evening devotions. They were\r\nsinging a hymn in the Nez Percés language. Having finished, they all\r\nknelt and bowed their faces on the buffalo-robe, and Creekie prayed long\r\nand fervently. Afterward they sung another hymn, and retired. To\r\nhospitality, family affection, and devotion, Creekie added honesty and\r\ncleanliness to a great degree, manifesting by these fruits, so contrary\r\nto the nature and habits of his race, the beautiful influence of the\r\nwork of grace on the heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of the Nez Percés in the official records of the\r\nIndian Bureau is in the year 1843. In that year an agent was sent out to\r\ninvestigate the condition of the Oregon tribes, and he reports as\r\nfollows: \"The only tribes from which much is to be hoped, or anything to\r\nbe feared in this part of Oregon, are the Walla Wallas, Cayuses, and Nez\r\nPercés, inhabiting a district on the Columbia and its tributaries,\r\ncommencing two hundred and forty miles from its mouth, and stretching\r\nfour hundred and eighty miles in the interior.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nez Percés, living farther inland, \"inhabit a beautiful grazing\r\ndistrict, not surpassed by any I have seen for verdure, water\r\nprivileges, climate, or health. This tribe forms an honorable exception\r\nto the general Indian character—being more noble, industrious, sensible,\r\nand better disposed toward the whites and their improvements in the arts\r\nand sciences; and though brave as Cæsar, the whites have nothing to\r\ndread at their hands in case of their dealing out to them what they\r\nconceive to be right and equitable.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this agent arrived at the missionary station among the Nez Percés,\r\nhe was met there by a large body of the Indians with twenty-two of their\r\nchiefs. The missionaries received him \"with joyful countenances and glad\r\nhearts;\" the Indians, \"with civility, gravity, and dignified reserve.\"\r\n\r\nHe addressed them at length, explaining to them the kind intentions of\r\nthe Government toward them. They listened with \"gravity, fixed\r\nattention, and decorum.\" Finally an aged chief, ninety years of age,\r\narose and said: \"I speak to-day; perhaps to-morrow I die. I am the\r\noldest chief of the tribe. I was the high chief when your great\r\nbrothers, Lewis and Clarke, visited this country. They visited me, and\r\nhonored me with their friendship and counsel. I showed them my numerous\r\nwounds, received in bloody battle with the Snakes. They told me it was\r\nnot good; it was better to be at peace; gave me a flag of truce; I held\r\nit up high. We met, and talked, but never fought again. Clarke pointed\r\nto this day—to you and this occasion. We have long waited in\r\nexpectation; sent three of our sons to Red River school to prepare for\r\nit; two of them sleep with their fathers; the other is here, and can be\r\nears, mouth, and pen for us. I can say no more; I am quickly tired; my\r\nvoice and limbs tremble. I am glad I live to see you and this day; but I\r\nshall soon be still and quiet in death.\"\r\n\r\nAt this council the Nez Percés elected a head chief named Ellis, and\r\nadopted the following Code of Laws:\r\n\r\n    _Art. 1._ Whoever wilfully takes life shall be hung.\r\n\r\n    _Art. 2._ Whoever burns a dwelling-house shall be hung.\r\n\r\n    _Art. 3._ Whoever burns an out-building shall be imprisoned six\r\n    months, receive fifty lashes, and pay all damages.\r\n\r\n    _Art. 4._ Whoever carelessly burns a house or any property shall\r\n    pay damages.\r\n\r\n    _Art. 5._ If any one enter a dwelling without permission of the\r\n    occupant, the chiefs shall punish him as they think proper.\r\n    Public rooms are excepted.\r\n\r\n    _Art. 6._ If any one steal, he shall pay back twofold; and if it\r\n    be the value of a beaver-skin or less, he shall receive\r\n    twenty-five lashes; and if the value is over a beaver-skin, he\r\n    shall pay back twofold, and receive fifty lashes.\r\n\r\n    _Art. 7._ If any one take a horse and ride it, without\r\n    permission, or take any article and use it, without liberty, he\r\n    shall pay for the use of it, and receive from twenty to fifty\r\n    lashes, as the chief shall direct.\r\n\r\n    _Art. 8._ If any one enter a field and injure the crops, or\r\n    throw down the fence, so that cattle or horses go in and do\r\n    damage, he shall pay all damages, and receive twenty-five lashes\r\n    for every offence.\r\n\r\n    _Art. 9._ Those only may keep dogs who travel or live among the\r\n    game. If a dog kill a lamb, calf, or any domestic animal, the\r\n    owner shall pay the damage, and kill the dog.\r\n\r\n    _Art. 10._ If an Indian raise a gun or other weapon against a\r\n    white man, it shall be reported to the chiefs, and they shall\r\n    punish him. If a white man do the same to an Indian, it shall be\r\n    reported to Dr. White, and he shall punish or redress it.\r\n\r\n    _Art. 11._ If an Indian break these laws, he shall be punished\r\n    by his chiefs; if a white man break them, he shall be reported\r\n    to the agent, and punished at his instance.\r\n\r\nThese laws, the agent says, he \"proposed one by one, leaving them as\r\nfree to reject as to accept. They were greatly pleased with all\r\nproposed, but wished a heavier penalty to some, and suggested the\r\ndog-law, which was annexed.\"\r\n\r\nIn a history of Oregon written by one W. H. Gray, of Astoria, we find\r\nthis Indian agent spoken of as a \"notorious blockhead.\" Mr. Gray's\r\nmethods of mention of all persons toward whom he has antagonism or\r\ndislike are violent and undignified, and do not redound either to his\r\ncredit as a writer or his credibility as a witness. But it is impossible\r\nto avoid the impression that in this instance he was not far from the\r\ntruth. Surely one cannot read, without mingled horror and incredulity,\r\nthis programme of the whipping-post, offered as one of the first\r\ninstalments of the United States Government's \"kind intentions\" toward\r\nthese Indians; one of the first practical illustrations given them of\r\nthe kind of civilization the United States Government would recommend\r\nand introduce.\r\n\r\nWe are not surprised to read in another narrative of affairs in Oregon,\r\na little later, that \"the Indians want pay for being whipped, the same\r\nas they did for praying—to please the missionaries—during the great\r\nrevival of 1839. *** Some of the influential men in the tribe desired to\r\nknow of what benefit this whipping-system was going to be to them. They\r\nsaid they were willing it should continue, provided they were to receive\r\nshirts and pants and blankets as a reward for being whipped. They had\r\nbeen whipped a good many times, and had got nothing for it, and it had\r\ndone them no good. If this state of things was to continue, it was all\r\ngood for nothing, and they would throw it away.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War does not appear to have seen this aspect of his\r\nagent's original efforts in the line of jurisprudence. He says of the\r\nreport which includes this astounding code, merely that \"it furnishes\r\nsome deeply interesting and curious details respecting certain of the\r\nIndian tribes in that remote part of our territories,\" and that the\r\nconduct of the Nez Percés on the occasion of this important meeting\r\n\"impresses one most agreeably.\"\r\n\r\nA report submitted at the same time by the Rev. Mr. Spaulding, who had\r\nlived six years as missionary among the Nez Percés, is much pleasanter\r\nreading. He says that \"nearly all the principal men and chiefs are\r\nmembers of the school; that they are as industrious in their schools as\r\non their farms. They cultivate their lands with much skill and to good\r\nadvantage, and many more would do so if they had the means. About one\r\nhundred are printing their own books with the pen. This keeps up a deep\r\ninterest, as they daily have new lessons to print; and what they print\r\nmust be committed to memory as soon as possible. A good number are now\r\nso far advanced in reading and printing as to render much assistance in\r\nteaching. Their books are taken home at night, and every lodge becomes a\r\nschool-room. Their lessons are Scripture lessons; no others (except the\r\nlaws) seem to interest them.\"\r\n\r\nEven this missionary seems to have fallen under some strange glamour on\r\nthe subject of the whipping-code; for he adds: \"The laws which you so\r\nhappily prepared, and which were unanimously adopted by the people, I\r\nhave printed in the form of a small school-book. A great number of the\r\nschool now read them fluently.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next year's report of the Secretary of War we read that \"the Nez\r\nPercé tribe have adopted a few simple and plain laws as their code,\r\nwhich will teach them self-restraint, and is the beginning of government\r\non their part.\" The Secretary also thinks it \"very remarkable that there\r\nshould so soon be several well supported, well attended, and well\r\nconducted schools in Oregon.\" (Not at all remarkable, considering that\r\nthe Congregationalists, the Methodist Episcopalians, and the Roman\r\nCatholics have all had missionaries at work there for eight years.)\r\n\r\nIn 1846, the Nez Percés, with the rest of the Oregon tribes, disappear\r\nfrom the official records of the Indian Bureau. \"It will be necessary to\r\nmake some provision for conducting our relations with the Indian tribes\r\nwest of the Rocky Mountains,\" it is said; but, \"the whole subject having\r\nbeen laid before Congress, it was not deemed advisable to continue a\r\nservice that was circumscribed in its objects, and originally designed\r\nto be temporary.\" The founder of the whipping-post in Oregon was\r\ntherefore relieved from his duties, and it is to be hoped his laws\r\nspeedily fell into disuse. The next year all the Protestant missions in\r\nOregon were abandoned, in consequence of the frightful massacre by the\r\nCayuses of the missionary families living among them.[13] But the Nez\r\nPercés, though deprived of their teaching, did not give up the faith and\r\nthe practice they had taught them. Six years later General Benjamin\r\nAlvord bore the following testimony to their religious character:\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Art. XIII.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of 1853 a white man, who had passed the previous winter\r\nin the country of the Nez Percés, came to the military post at the\r\nDalles, and on being questioned as to the manners and customs of the\r\ntribe, he said that he wintered with a band of several hundred in\r\nnumber, and that the whole party assembled every evening and morning for\r\nprayer, the exercises being conducted by one of themselves in their own\r\nlanguage. He stated that on Sunday they assembled for exhortation and\r\nworship.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1851 a superintendent and three agents were appointed for Indian\r\nservice in Oregon. Treaties were negotiated with some of the tribes, but\r\nthey were not ratified, and in 1853 there was, in consequence, a\r\nwide-spread dissatisfaction among all the Indians in the region. \"They\r\nhave become distrustful of all promises made them by the United States,\"\r\nsays the Oregon superintendent, \"and believe the design of the\r\nGovernment is to defer doing anything for them till they have wasted\r\naway. The settlement of the whites on the tracts which they regarded as\r\nsecured to them by solemn treaty stipulations, results in frequent\r\nmisunderstandings between them and the settlers, and occasions and\r\naugments bitter animosities and resentments. I am in almost daily\r\nreceipt of complaints and petitions for a redress of wrongs from both\r\nparties.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Stevens, of Washington Territory, in charge of the Northern\r\nPacific Railroad Explorations and Survey, wrote, this year, \"These\r\nhitherto neglected tribes, whose progress from the wild wanderers of the\r\nplains to kind and hospitable neighbors is personally known to you, are\r\nentitled, by every consideration of justice and humanity, to the\r\nfatherly care of the Government.\"\r\n\r\nIn Governor Stevens's report is to be found a comprehensive and\r\nintelligible account of all the Indian tribes in Oregon and Washington\r\nTerritory. The greater part of the Nez Percés' country was now within\r\nthe limits of Washington Territory, only a few bands remaining in\r\nOregon. They were estimated to number at least eighteen hundred, and\r\nwere said to be a \"rich and powerful tribe, owning many horses.\" Every\r\nyear they crossed the mountains to hunt buffalo on the plains of the\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 there was a general outbreak of hostilities on the part of the\r\nOregon Indians. Tribe after tribe, even among those who had been\r\nconsidered friendly, fell into the ranks of the hostiles, and some base\r\nacts of treachery were committed. The Oregon settlers, menaced with\r\ndanger on all sides, became naturally so excited and terrified that\r\ntheir actions were hasty and ill-advised. \"They are without discipline,\r\nwithout order, and similar to madmen,\" says one official report. \"Every\r\nday they run off the horses and the cattle of the friendly Indians. I\r\nwill soon no longer be able to restrain the friendly Indians. They are\r\nindignant at conduct so unworthy of the whites, who have made so many\r\npromises to respect and protect them if they remain faithful friends. I\r\nam very sure, if the volunteers are not arrested in their brigand\r\nactions, our Indians will save themselves by flying to the homes of\r\ntheir relations, the Nez Percés, who have promised them help; and then\r\nall these Indians of Oregon would join in the common defence until they\r\nbe entirely exterminated.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to do full justice to the moral courage which is shown\r\nby Indians who remain friendly to whites under such circumstances as\r\nthese. The traditions of their race, the powerful influence of public\r\nsentiment among their relatives and friends, and, in addition, terror\r\nfor their own lives—all combine in times of such outbreaks to draw even\r\nthe friendliest tribes into sympathy and co-operation with those who are\r\nmaking war on whites.\r\n\r\nAt this time the hostile Indians in Oregon sent word to the Nez Percés,\r\n\"Join us in the war against the whites, or we will wipe you out.\" They\r\nsaid, \"We have made the whites run out of the country, and we will now\r\nmake the friendly Indians do the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can the friendly Indians do?\" wrote the colonel of a company of\r\nWashington Territory Volunteers; \"they have no ammunition, and the\r\nwhites will give them none; and the hostiles say to them, 'We have\r\nplenty; come and join us, and save your lives.' The Nez Percés are very\r\nmuch alarmed; they say, 'We have no ammunition to defend ourselves with\r\nif we are attacked.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Oregon superintendent writes to General Wool (in command at this\r\ntime of the Department of the Pacific), imploring him to send troops to\r\nOregon to protect both friendly Indians and white settlers, and to\r\nenable this department to maintain guarantees secured to these Indians\r\nby treaty stipulations. He says that the friendly Indians are \"willing\r\nto submit to almost any sacrifice to obtain peace, but there may be a\r\npoint beyond which they could not be induced to go without a struggle.\"\r\n\r\nThis outbreak terminated after some sharp fighting, and about equal\r\nlosses on both sides, in what the Oregon superintendent calls \"a sort of\r\narmistice,\" which left the Indians \"much emboldened,\" with the\r\nimpression on their minds that they have the \"ability to contend\r\nsuccessfully against the entire white race.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, \"the non-ratification of the treaties heretofore made to\r\nextinguish their title to the lands necessary for the occupancy and use\r\nof our citizens, seems to have produced no little disappointment; and\r\nthe continued extension of our settlements into their territory, without\r\nany compensation being made to them, is a constant source of\r\ndissatisfaction and hostile feeling.\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be expected that Indians situated like those in Oregon and\r\nWashington Territory, occupying extensive sections of country where,\r\nfrom the game and otherwise, they derive a comfortable support, will\r\nquietly and peaceably submit, without any equivalent, to be deprived of\r\ntheir homes and possessions, and to be driven off to some other locality\r\nwhere they cannot find their usual means of subsistence. Such a\r\nproceeding is not only contrary to our policy hitherto, but is repugnant\r\nalike to the dictates of humanity and the principles of natural justice.\r\n\r\n\"The principle of recognizing and respecting the usufruct right of the\r\nIndians to the lands occupied by them has not been so strictly adhered\r\nto in the case of the tribes in the Territories of Oregon and\r\nWashington. When a territorial government was first provided for\r\nOregon—which then embraced the present Territory of Washington—strong\r\ninducements were held out to our people to emigrate and settle there\r\nwithout the usual arrangements being made in advance for the\r\nextinguishment of the title of the Indians who occupied and claimed the\r\nlands. Intruded upon, ousted of their homes and possessions without any\r\ncompensation, and deprived in most cases of their accustomed means of\r\nsupport, without any arrangement having been made to enable them to\r\nestablish and maintain themselves in other locations, it is not a matter\r\nof surprise that they have committed many depredations upon our\r\ncitizens, and been exasperated to frequent acts of hostility.\"\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, the armistice proved of no avail; and in 1858 the\r\nunfortunate Territories had another Indian war on their hands. In this\r\nwar we find the Nez Percés fighting on the side of the United States\r\nagainst the hostile Indians. One of the detachments of United States\r\ntroops was saved from destruction only by taking refuge with them.\r\nNearly destitute of ammunition, and surrounded by hundreds of hostile\r\nIndians, the little company escaped by night; and \"after a ride of\r\nninety miles mostly at a gallop, and without a rest, reached Snake\r\nRiver,\" where they were met by this friendly tribe, who \"received them\r\nwith open arms, succored the wounded men, and crossed in safety the\r\nwhole command over the difficult and dangerous river.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer in command of the Nez Percé band writes as follows, in his\r\nreport to the Indian Commissioner:\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, my dear sir, while this general war is going on, to point you\r\nto at least a few green spots where the ravages of war do not as yet\r\nextend, and which thus far are untainted and unaffected, with a view of\r\nso retaining them that we may hereafter point to them as oases in this\r\ndesert of war. These green spots are the Nez Percés, the Flat-heads, and\r\nPend d'Oreilles. In this connection I refer with grateful pride to an\r\nact of Colonel Wright, which embodies views and motives which, endorsed\r\nand carried out by the Government, must redound to his credit and\r\npraise, and be the means of building up, at no distant day, a bold,\r\nbrave, warlike, and numerous people.\r\n\r\n\"Before leaving Walla-Walla, Colonel Wright assembled the Nez Percé\r\npeople, told them his object was to war with and punish our enemies; but\r\nas this great people were and ever had been our friends, he wanted their\r\nfriendship to be as enduring as the mountains around which they lived;\r\nand in order that no difference of views or difficulty might arise, that\r\ntheir mutual promises should be recorded.\"\r\n\r\nWith this view he there made a treaty of friendship with them, and\r\nthirty of the bravest warriors and chiefs at once marshalled themselves\r\nto accompany him against the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Wright asked these Indians what they wanted, \"their reply\r\nwas worthy of a noble race—'Peace, ploughs, and schools.'\" At this time\r\nthey had no agent appointed to attend to their welfare; they were\r\nraising wheat, corn, and vegetables with the rude means at their\r\ncommand, and still preserved the faith and many of the practices taught\r\nthem by the missionaries thirteen years before.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 peace was again established in Oregon, and the Indians\r\n\"considered as conquered.\" The treaties of 1855 were ratified by the\r\nSenate, and this fact went far to restore tranquillity in the\r\nterritories. Congress was implored by the superintendents to realize\r\n\"the importance of making the appropriations for fulfilling those treaty\r\nstipulations at the earliest practicable moment;\" that it may \"prevent\r\nthe recurrence of another savage war, necessarily bloody and devastating\r\nto our settlements, extended under the authority and sanction of our\r\nGovernment.\" With marvellous self-restraint, the superintendents do not\r\nenforce their appeals by a reference to the fact that, if the treaties\r\nhad been fulfilled in the outset, all the hostilities of the last four\r\nyears might probably have been avoided.\r\n\r\nThe reservation secured to the Nez Percés was a fine tract of country,\r\none hundred miles long and sixty in width—well watered, timbered, and of\r\ngreat natural resources. Already the Indians had begun to practice\r\nirrigation in their fields; had large herds of horses, and were\r\nbeginning to give attention to improving the breed. Some of them could\r\nread and write their own language, and many of them professed\r\nChristianity, and were exemplary in their conduct—a most remarkable\r\nfact, proving the depth of the impression the missionary teachings must\r\nhave made. The majority of them wore the American costume, and showed\r\n\"their progress in civilization by attaching little value to the gewgaws\r\nand trinkets which so generally captivate the savage.\"\r\n\r\nIn less than two years the peace of this noble tribe was again invaded;\r\nthis time by a deadly foe—the greed of gold. In 1861 there were said to\r\nbe no less than ten thousand miners in the Nez Percé country prospecting\r\nfor gold. Now arose the question, What will the Government do? Will it\r\nprotect the rights of the Indians or not?\r\n\r\n\"To attempt to restrain miners would be like attempting to restrain the\r\nwhirlwind,\" writes the superintendent of Washington Territory; and he\r\nconfesses that, \"seeing the utter impossibility of preventing miners\r\nfrom going to the mines,\" he has refrained from taking any steps which,\r\nby a certain want of success, would tend to weaken the force of the law.\r\n\r\nFor the next few years the Nez Percés saw with dismay the steady stream\r\nof settlers pouring into their country. That they did not resist it by\r\nforce is marvellous, and can only be explained by the power of a truly\r\nChristian spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Their reservation was overrun by the enterprising miners; treaty\r\nstipulations were disregarded and trampled under foot; towns were\r\nestablished thereon, and all the means that cupidity could invent or\r\ndisloyalty achieve were resorted to to shake their confidence in the\r\nGovernment. They were disturbed in the peaceable possession of what they\r\nregarded as their vested rights, sacredly secured by treaty. They were\r\ninformed that the Government was destroyed, and that whatever treaties\r\nwere made would never be carried out. All resistance on their part\r\nproved unavailing, and inquietude and discontent predominated among\r\nthem,\" says the Governor of Idaho, in 1865. Shortly after, by the\r\norganization of that new Territory, the Nez Percés' reservation had been\r\nremoved from the jurisdiction of Washington Territory to that of Idaho.\r\n\r\nA powerful party was organized in the tribe, advocating the forming of a\r\nleague with the Crows and Blackfeet against the whites. The non-arrival\r\nof promised supplies; the non-payment of promised moneys; the unchecked\r\ninflux of miners throughout the reservation, put strong weapons into the\r\nhands of these disaffected ones. But the chiefs \"remained firm and\r\nunwavering in their devotion to the Government and the laws. They are\r\nintelligent—their head chief, Sawyer, particularly so—and tell their\r\npeople to still wait patiently.\" And yet, at this very time, there was\r\ndue from the United States Government to this chief Sawyer six hundred\r\nand twenty-five dollars! He had for six months been suffering for the\r\ncommonest necessaries of life, and had been driven to disposing of his\r\nvouchers at fifty cents on the dollar to purchase necessaries. The\r\nwarriors also, who fought for us so well in 1856, were still unpaid;\r\nalthough in the seventh article of the treaty of 1863 it had been agreed\r\nthat \"the claims of certain members of the Nez Percé tribe against the\r\nGovernment, for services rendered and horses furnished by them to the\r\nOregon Mounted Volunteers, as appears by certificates issued by W. H.\r\nFauntleroy, Acting Regimental Quartermaster, and commanding Oregon\r\nVolunteers, on the 6th of March, 1856, at Camp Cornelius, and amounting\r\nto $4665, shall be paid to them in full in gold coin.\"\r\n\r\nHow many communities of white men would remain peaceable, loyal, and\r\nfriendly under such a strain as this?\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the Indian Bureau report of the state of our diplomatic\r\nrelations with the Nez Percés is that the treaty concluded with them in\r\n1863 was ratified by the Senate, \"with an amendment which awaited the\r\naction of the Indians. The ratification of this treaty has been delayed\r\nfor several years for various reasons, partly arising from successive\r\nchanges in the Superintendent of Indian Affairs in Idaho, whose varying\r\nopinions on the subject of the treaty have caused doubts in the minds of\r\nsenators. A later treaty had been made, but, on careful consideration of\r\nthe subject, it was deemed advisable to carry into effect that of 1863.\r\nThe Nez Percés claimed title to a very large district of country\r\ncomprised in what are now organized as Oregon, Washington, and Idaho,\r\nbut principally within the latter Territory; and already a large white\r\npopulation is pressing upon them in the search for gold. They are\r\npeaceable, industrious, and friendly, and altogether one of the most\r\npromising of the tribes west of the Rocky Mountains, having profited\r\nlargely by the labors of missionaries among them.\"\r\n\r\nBy the treaty ratified in this year they give up \"all their lands except\r\na reservation defined by certain natural boundaries, and agree to remove\r\nto this reservation within one year. Where they have improvements on\r\nlands outside of it, such improvements are to be appraised and paid for.\r\nThe tillable lands are to be surveyed into tracts of twenty acres each,\r\nand allotted to such Indians as desire to hold lands in severalty. The\r\nGovernment is to continue the annuities due under former treaties, and,\r\nin addition, pay the tribe, or expend for them for certain specific\r\npurposes having their improvement in view, the sum of $262,500, and a\r\nmoderate sum is devoted to homes and salaries for chiefs. The right of\r\nway is secured through the reservation, and the Government undertakes to\r\nreserve all important springs and watering-places for public use.\"\r\n\r\nIn this same year the Governor of Idaho writes, in his annual report to\r\nthe Department of the Interior: \"Prominent among the tribes of Northern\r\nIdaho stand the Nez Percés, a majority of whom boast that they have ever\r\nbeen the faithful friends of the white man. But a few over half of the\r\nentire tribe of the Nez Percés are under treaty. The fidelity of those\r\nunder treaty, even under the most discouraging circumstances, must\r\ncommend itself to the favorable consideration of the Department. The\r\nnon-payment of their annuities has had its natural effect on the minds\r\nof some of those under treaty; but their confiding head chief, Sawyer,\r\nremains unmoved, and on all occasions is found the faithful apologist\r\nfor any failure of the Government. Could this tribe have been kept aloof\r\nfrom the contaminating vices of white men, and had it been in the power\r\nof the Government promptly to comply with the stipulations of the treaty\r\nof 1855, there can be no doubt but that their condition at this time\r\nwould have been a most prosperous one, and that the whole of the Nez\r\nPercé nation would by this time have been willing to come under treaty,\r\nand settle on the reservation with those already there.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the patience of the Nez Percés is beginning to show signs of\r\nwearing out. The Governor of Idaho writes: \"This disaffection is great,\r\nand serious trouble is imminent. It could all be settled by prompt\r\npayment by the Government of their just dues; but if delayed too long I\r\ngreatly fear open hostilities. They have been patient, but promises and\r\nexplanations are losing force with them now. *** Their grievances are\r\nurged with such earnestness that even Sawyer, who has always been our\r\napologist, has in a measure abandoned his pacific policy, and asks\r\nboldly that we do them justice. *** Even now it may not be too late;\r\nbut, if neglected, war may be reasonably expected. Should the Nez Percés\r\nstrike a blow, all over our Territory and around our boundaries will\r\nblaze the signal-fires and gleam the tomahawks of the savages—Kootenays,\r\nPen d'Oreilles, Cœur d'Alenes, Blackfeet, Flat-heads, Spokanes,\r\nPelouses, Bannocks, and Shoshones will be involved.\"\r\n\r\nThis disaffection, says the agent, \"began to show itself soon after the\r\nvisit of George C. Haigh, Esq., special agent, last December, to obtain\r\ntheir assent to the amendments to the treaty of June 9th, 1863—the\r\nnon-ratification of that treaty had gone on so long, and promises made\r\nthem by Governor Lyon that it would not be ratified, and that he was\r\nauthorized to make a new treaty with them by which they would retain all\r\nof their country, as given them under the treaty of 1851, except the\r\nsite of the town of Lewiston. They had also been informed in March,\r\n1866, that Governor Lyon would be here in the June following, to pay\r\nthem back-annuities due under the treaty of 1855. The failure to carry\r\nout these promises, and the idea they have that the stipulations of the\r\ntreaty of 1863 will be carried out in the same manner, is one of the\r\ncauses of their bad feeling. It showed itself plainly at the council\r\nlately held, and is on the increase. If there is the same delay in\r\ncarrying out the stipulations of the treaty of 1863 that there has been\r\nin that of 1855, some of the chiefs with their bands will join the\r\nhostile Indians. There are many things it is impossible to explain to\r\nthem. They cannot understand why the $1185 that was promised by Governor\r\nLyon to the Indian laborers on the church is not paid. He told them when\r\nthe walls were up they should receive their pay. These laborers were\r\npoor men, and such inducements were held out to them that they commenced\r\nthe work in good faith, with the full expectation of receiving their pay\r\nwhen their labors ceased.\"\r\n\r\nThe head chief Sawyer's pay is still in arrears. For the last quarter of\r\n1863, and the first and second of 1864, he has received no pay. No\r\nwonder he has ceased to be the \"apologist\" of the Government, which four\r\nyears ago promised him an annuity of $500 a year.\r\n\r\nSpite of this increasing disaffection the Nez Percés are industrious and\r\nprosperous. They raised in this year 15,000 bushels of wheat. \"Many of\r\nthem carried their wheat to be ground to the mills, while many sold the\r\ngrain to packers for feed, while much of it is boiled whole for food.\r\nSome few of the better class have had their wheat ground, and sold the\r\nflour in the mining-camps at lower prices than packers could lay it down\r\nin the camps. Some have small pack-trains running through the summer;\r\none in particular, Cru-cru-lu-ye, runs some fifteen animals; he\r\nsometimes packs for whites, and again runs on his own account. A\r\nClearwater Station merchant a short time ago informed me of his buying\r\nsome oats of Cru-cru-lu-ye last fall. After the grain had been weighed,\r\nand emptied out of the sacks, the Indian brought the empty sacks to the\r\nscales to have them weighed, and the tare deducted, saying he only\r\nwanted pay for the oats. Their sales of melons, tomatoes, corn,\r\npotatoes, squashes, green pease, etc., during the summer, in the\r\ndifferent towns and mining-camps, bring in some $2000 to $3000. Their\r\nstock of horses and cattle is increasing fast, and with the benefits to\r\nbe derived from good American stallions, and good bulls and cows, to be\r\ndistributed to them under the stipulations of the treaty of 1863, they\r\nwill rapidly increase in wealth.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1869 their reservation is still unsurveyed, and when the Indians\r\nclaim that white settlers are establishing themselves inside the lines\r\nthere is no way of proving it, and the agent says all he can do is to\r\npromise that \"the white man's heart shall be better;\" and thus the\r\nmatter will rest until another disturbance arises, when the same\r\ncomplaints are made, and the same answers given as before—that \"the\r\nwhite man's heart shall be better, and the boundary-line shall be\r\nsurveyed.\"\r\n\r\nOther treaty stipulations are still unfulfilled; and the non-treaty\r\nparty, while entirely peaceable, is very strong, and immovably opposed\r\nto treaties.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, seven years after it was promised, the long deferred survey of\r\nthe reservation was made. The superintendent and the agent both\r\nremonstrated, but in vain, against the manner in which it was done; and\r\nthree years later a Board of Special Commissioners, appointed to inquire\r\ninto the condition of the Indians in Idaho, examined the fence put up at\r\nthat time, and reported that it was \"a most scandalous fraud. It is a\r\npost-and-board fence. The posts are not well set. Much of the lumber is\r\ndeficient in width and length. The posts are not dressed. The lumber\r\nlaps at any joint where it may chance to meet, whether on the posts or\r\nbetween them, and the boards are not jointed on the posts where they\r\nmeet; they are lapped and fastened generally with one nail, so that they\r\nare falling down rapidly. The lumber was cut on the reservation. The\r\ncontract price of the fence was very high; the fencing done in places of\r\nno value to any one, for the reason that water cannot be had for\r\nirrigation. The Government cannot be a party to such frauds on the\r\npeople who intrust it with their property.\"\r\n\r\nIn this year a commission was sent to Oregon to hold council with the\r\nband of Nez Percés occupying Wallowa Valley, in Oregon, \"with a view to\r\ntheir removal, if practicable, to the Nez Percé Reservation in Idaho.\r\nThey reported this removal to be impracticable, and the Wallowa Valley\r\nhas been withdrawn from sale, and set apart for their use and occupation\r\nby Executive order.\"[14]\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Report of the Secretary of the Interior for 1873.\r\n\r\nThis commission report that one of the most troublesome questions in the\r\nway of the Government's control of Indian affairs in Idaho is the\r\ncontest between the Catholic and Protestant churches. This strife is a\r\ngreat detriment to the Indians. To illustrate this, they quote Chief\r\nJoseph's reason for not wishing schools on his reservation. He was the\r\nchief of the non-treaty band of Nez Percés occupying the Wallowa Valley,\r\nin Oregon:\r\n\r\n\"Do you want schools and school-houses on the Wallowa Reservation?\"\r\nasked the commissioners.\r\n\r\n_Joseph._ \"No, we do not want schools or school-houses on the Wallowa\r\nReservation.\"\r\n\r\n_Com._ \"Why do you not want schools?\"\r\n\r\n_Joseph._ \"They will teach us to have churches.\"\r\n\r\n_Com._ \"Do you not want churches?\"\r\n\r\n_Joseph._ \"No, we do not want churches.\"\r\n\r\n_Com._ \"Why do you not want churches?\"\r\n\r\n_Joseph._ \"They will teach us to quarrel about God, as the Catholics and\r\nProtestants do on the Nez Percé Reservation, and at other places. We do\r\nnot want to learn that. We may quarrel with men sometimes about things\r\non this earth, but we never quarrel about God. We do not want to learn\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nGreat excitement prevailed among the settlers in Oregon at the cession\r\nof the Wallowa Valley to the Indians. The presence of United States\r\nsoldiers prevented any outbreak; but the resentment of the whites was\r\nvery strong, and threats were openly made that the Indians should not be\r\npermitted to occupy it; and in 1875 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n\"The settlements made in the Wallowa Valley, which has for years been\r\nthe pasture-ground of the large herds of horses owned by Joseph's band,\r\nwill occasion more or less trouble between this band and the whites,\r\nuntil Joseph is induced or compelled to settle on his reservation.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only two years since this valley was set apart by Executive order\r\nfor the use and occupation of these Indians; already the Department is\r\ncontemplating \"compelling\" them to leave it and go to the reservation in\r\nIdaho. There were stormy scenes there also during this year. Suits were\r\nbrought against all the employés of the Lapwai Agency, and a claim set\r\nup for all the lands of the agency, and for many of the Indian farms, by\r\none Langford, representing the old claim of the missionaries, to whom a\r\nlarge tract of ground had been ceded some thirty years before. He\r\nattempted to take forcible possession of the place, and was ejected\r\nfinally by military force, after the decision of the Attorney-general\r\nhad been given that his claim was invalid.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Bureau recommended a revocation of the executive order giving\r\nthe Wallowa Valley to Joseph and his band. In June of this year\r\nPresident Grant revoked the order, and in the autumn a commission was\r\nsent out \"to visit these Indians, with a view to secure their permanent\r\nsettlement on the reservation, their early entrance on a civilized life,\r\nand to adjust the difficulties then existing between them and the\r\nsettlers.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to study with some care the reasons which this\r\ncommission gave to Chief Joseph why the Wallowa Valley, which had been\r\ngiven to him by Executive order in 1873, must be taken away from him by\r\nExecutive order in 1875:\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the coldness of the climate, it is not a suitable location for\r\nan Indian reservation. *** It is now in part settled by white squatters\r\nfor grazing purposes. *** The President claimed that he extinguished the\r\nIndian title to it by the treaty of 1863. *** It is embraced within the\r\nlimits of the State of Oregon. *** The State of Oregon could not\r\nprobably be induced to cede the jurisdiction of the valley to the United\r\nStates for an Indian reservation. *** In the conflicts which might arise\r\nin the future, as in the past, between him and the whites, the President\r\nmight not be able to justify or defend him. *** A part of the valley had\r\nalready been surveyed and opened to settlement: *** if, by some\r\narrangement, the white settlers in the valley could be induced to leave\r\nit, others would come.\"\r\n\r\nTo all these statements Joseph replied that he \"asked nothing of the\r\nPresident. He was able to take care of himself. He did not desire\r\nWallowa Valley as a reservation, for that would subject him and his band\r\nto the will of, and dependence on, another, and to laws not of their own\r\nmaking. He was disposed to live peaceably. He and his band had suffered\r\nwrong rather than do wrong. One of their number was wickedly slain by a\r\nwhite man during the last summer, but he would not avenge his death.\"\r\n\r\n\"The serious and feeling manner in which he uttered these sentiments was\r\nimpressive,\" the commissioners say, and they proceeded to reply to him\r\n\"that the President was not disposed to deprive him of any just right,\r\nor govern him by his individual will, but merely subject him to the same\r\njust and equal laws by which he himself as well as all his people were\r\nruled.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean when commissioners sent by the President to induce a\r\nband of Indians to go on a reservation to live, tell them that they\r\nshall be subjected on that reservation \"merely to the same just and\r\nequal laws\" by which the President and \"all his people are ruled?\" And\r\nstill more, what is the explanation of their being so apparently unaware\r\nof the enormity of the lie that they leave it on official record, signed\r\nby their names in full? It is only explained, as thousands of other\r\nthings in the history of our dealings with the Indians are only to be\r\nexplained, by the habitual indifference, carelessness, and inattention\r\nwith which questions relative to Indian affairs and legislation thereon\r\nare handled and disposed of, in whatever way seems easiest and shortest\r\nfor the time being. The members of this commission knew perfectly well\r\nthat the instant Joseph and his band moved on to the reservation they\r\nbecame subject to laws totally different from those by which the\r\nPresident and \"all his people were ruled,\" and neither \"just\" nor\r\n\"equal:\" laws forbidding them to go beyond certain bounds without a pass\r\nfrom the agent; laws making them really just as much prisoners as\r\nconvicts in a prison—the only difference being that the reservation is\r\nan unwalled out-of-door prison; laws giving that agent power to summon\r\nmilitary power at any moment, to enforce any command he might choose to\r\nlay on them, and to shoot them if they refused to obey.[15] \"The same\r\njust and equal laws by which the President himself and all his people\r\nare ruled!\" Truly it is a psychological phenomenon that four men should\r\nbe found willing to leave it on record under their own signatures that\r\nthey said this thing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Witness the murder of Big Snake on the Ponca Reservation, Indian\r\n  Territory, in the summer of 1879.\r\n\r\nFarther on in the same report there is an enumeration of some of the\r\nexperiences which the Nez Percés who are on the Idaho Reservation have\r\nhad of the advantages of living there, and of the manner in which the\r\nGovernment has fulfilled its promises by which it induced them to go\r\nthere; undoubtedly these were all as well known to Chief Joseph as to\r\nthe commissioners. For twenty-two years he had had an opportunity to\r\nstudy the workings of the reservation policy. They say:\r\n\r\n\"During an interview held with the agent and the treaty Indians, for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining whether there were sufficient unoccupied\r\ntillable lands for Joseph's band on the reservation, and for the further\r\npurpose of securing their co-operation to aid us in inducing Joseph to\r\ncome upon the reservation, facts were brought to our attention of a\r\nfailure on the part of the Government to fulfil its treaty stipulations\r\nwith these Indians. The commission therefore deem it their duty to call\r\nthe attention of the Government to this subject.\r\n\r\n\"1st. Article second of the treaty of June 9th, 1863, provides that no\r\nwhite man—excepting such as may be employed by the Indian\r\nDepartment—shall be permitted to reside upon the reservation without\r\npermission of the tribe, and the superintendent and the agent.\r\nNevertheless, four white men are occupying or claiming large tracts on\r\nthe reservation.\r\n\r\n\"It is clearly the duty of the Government to adjust and quiet these\r\nclaims, and remove the parties from the reservation. Each day's delay to\r\nfulfil this treaty stipulation adds to the distrust of the Indians in\r\nthe good faith of the Government.\r\n\r\n\"2d. Article third of the same treaty of 1863 provides for the survey of\r\nthe land suitable for cultivation into lots of twenty acres each; while\r\na survey is reported to have been early made, no measures were then, or\r\nhave been since, taken to adjust farm limits to the lines of the\r\nsurveyed lots.\r\n\r\n\"3d. Rules and regulations for continuing the possession of these lots\r\nand the improvements thereon in the families of deceased Indians, have\r\nnot been prescribed, as required by the treaty.\r\n\r\n\"4th. It is also provided that certificates or deeds for such tracts\r\nshall be issued to individual Indians.\r\n\r\n\"The failure of the Government to comply with this important provision\r\nof the treaty causes much uneasiness among the Indians, who are little\r\ninclined to spend their labor and means in improving ground held by the\r\nuncertain tenure of the pleasure of an agent.\r\n\r\n\"5th. Article seventh of the treaty provides for a payment of four\r\nthousand six hundred and sixty-five dollars in gold coin to them for\r\nservices and horses furnished the Oregon Mounted Volunteers in 1856. It\r\nis asserted by the Indians that this provision of the treaty has\r\nhitherto been disregarded by the Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners say that \"every consideration of justice and equity,\r\nas well as expediency, demands from the Government a faithful and\r\nliteral compliance with all its treaty obligations toward the Indians. A\r\nfailure to do this is looked upon as bad faith, and can be productive of\r\nonly bad results.\"\r\n\r\nAt last Chief Joseph consented to remove from the Wallowa Valley with\r\nhis band, and go to the Lapwai Reservation. The incidents of the council\r\nin which this consent was finally wrung from him, are left on record in\r\nChief Joseph's own words, in an article written by him (through an\r\ninterpreter) and published in the _North American Review_ in 1874. It is\r\na remarkable contribution to Indian history.\r\n\r\nIt drew out a reply from General O. O. Howard, who called his paper \"The\r\ntrue History of the Wallowa Campaign:\" published in the _North American\r\nReview_ two months after Chief Joseph's paper.\r\n\r\nBetween the accounts given by General Howard and by Chief Joseph of the\r\nevents preceding the Nez Percé war, there are noticeable discrepancies.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard says that he listened to the \"oft-repeated dreamer\r\nnonsense of the chief, 'Too-hool-hool-suit,' with no impatience, but\r\nfinally said to him: 'Twenty times over I hear that the earth is your\r\nmother, and about the chieftainship of the earth. I want to hear it no\r\nmore.'\"\r\n\r\nChief Joseph says: \"General Howard lost his temper, and said 'Shut up! I\r\ndon't want to hear any more of such talk.'\r\n\r\n\"Too-hool-hool-suit answered, 'Who are you, that you ask us to talk, and\r\nthen tell me I sha'n't talk? Are you the Great Spirit? Did you make the\r\nworld?'\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard, quoting from his record at the time, says: \"The rough\r\nold fellow, in his most provoking tone, says something in a short\r\nsentence, looking fiercely at me. The interpreter quickly says: 'He\r\ndemands what person pretends to divide this land, and put me on it?' In\r\nthe most decided voice I said, 'I am the man. I stand here for the\r\nPresident, and there is no spirit, bad or good, that will hinder me. My\r\norders are plain, and will be executed.'\"\r\n\r\nChief Joseph says: \"General Howard replied, 'You are an impudent fellow,\r\nand I will put you in the guard-house,' and then ordered a soldier to\r\narrest him.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard says: \"After telling the Indians that this bad advice\r\nwould be their ruin, I asked the chiefs to go with me to look at their\r\nland. 'The old man (Too-hool-hool-suit) shall not go. I will leave him\r\nwith Colonel Perry.' He says, 'Do you want to scare me with reference to\r\nmy body?' I said, 'I will leave your body with Colonel Perry.' I then\r\narose and led him out of the council, and gave him into the charge of\r\nColonel Perry.\"\r\n\r\nChief Joseph says: \"Too-hool-hool-suit made no resistance. He asked\r\nGeneral Howard, 'Is that your order? I don't care. I have expressed my\r\nheart to you. I have nothing to take back. I have spoken for my country.\r\nYou can arrest me, but you cannot change me, or make me take back what I\r\nhave said.' The soldiers came forward and seized my friend, and took him\r\nto the guard—house. My men whispered among themselves whether they\r\nshould let this thing be done. I counselled them to submit. ***\r\nToo-hool-hool-suit was prisoner for five days before he was released.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard, it will be observed, does not use the word \"arrested,\"\r\nbut as he says, later, \"Too-hool-hool-suit was released on the pledge of\r\nLooking-glass and White Bird, and on his own earnest promise to behave\r\nbetter,\" it is plain that Chief Joseph did not misstate the facts. This\r\nIndian chief, therefore, was put under military arrest, and confined for\r\nfive days, for uttering what General Howard calls a \"tirade\" in a\r\ncouncil to which the Indians had been asked to come for the purpose of\r\nconsultation and expression of sentiment.\r\n\r\nDoes not Chief Joseph speak common-sense, as well as natural feeling, in\r\nsaying, \"I turned to my people and said, 'The arrest of\r\nToo-hool-hool-suit was wrong, but we will not resent the insult. We were\r\ninvited to this council to express our hearts, and we have done so.'\"\r\n\r\nIf such and so swift penalty as this, for \"tirades\" in council, were the\r\nlaw of our land, especially in the District of Columbia, it would be \"no\r\njust cause of complaint\" when Indians suffer it. But considering the\r\nfrequency, length, and safety of \"tirades\" in all parts of America, it\r\nseems unjust not to permit Indians to deliver them. However, they do\r\ncome under the head of \"spontaneous productions of the soil;\" and an\r\nIndian on a reservation is \"invested with no such proprietorship\" in\r\nanything which comes under that head.[16]\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Annual Report of the Indian Commissioner for 1878, p. 69.\r\n\r\nChief Joseph and his band consented to move. Chief Joseph says: \"I said\r\nin my heart that, rather than have war, I would give up my country. I\r\nwould give up my father's grave. I would give up everything rather than\r\nhave the blood of white men upon the hands of my people.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not easy for Joseph to bring his people to consent to move. The\r\nyoung men wished to fight. It has been told that, at this time, Chief\r\nJoseph rode one day through his village, with a revolver in each hand,\r\nsaying he would shoot the first one of his warriors that resisted the\r\nGovernment. Finally, they gathered all the stock they could find, and\r\nbegan the move. A storm came, and raised the river so high that some of\r\nthe cattle could not be taken across. Indian guards were put in charge\r\nof the cattle left behind. White men attacked these guards and took the\r\ncattle. After this Joseph could no longer restrain his men, and the\r\nwarfare began, which lasted over two months. It was a masterly campaign\r\non the part of the Indians. They were followed by General Howard; they\r\nhad General Crook on their right, and General Miles in front, but they\r\nwere not once hemmed in; and, at last, when they surrendered at Bear Paw\r\nMountain, in the Montana Hills, it was not because they were beaten, but\r\nbecause, as Joseph says, \"I could not bear to see my wounded men and\r\nwomen suffer any longer; we had lost enough already. *** We could have\r\nescaped from Bear Paw Mountain if we had left our wounded, old women and\r\nchildren, behind. We were unwilling to do this. We had never heard of a\r\nwounded Indian recovering while in the hands of white men. *** I\r\nbelieved General Miles, or I never would have surrendered. I have heard\r\nthat he has been censured for making the promise to return us to Lapwai.\r\nHe could not have made any other terms with me at that time. I could\r\nhave held him in check until my friends came to my assistance, and then\r\nneither of the generals nor their soldiers would ever have left Bear Paw\r\nMountain alive. On the fifth day I went to General Miles and gave up my\r\ngun, and said, 'From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more.' My\r\npeople needed rest; we wanted peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms of this surrender were shamefully violated. Joseph and his\r\nband were taken first to Fort Leavenworth and then to the Indian\r\nTerritory. At Leavenworth they were placed in the river bottom, with no\r\nwater but the river water to drink.\r\n\r\n\"Many of my people sickened and died, and we buried them in this strange\r\nland,\" says Joseph. \"I cannot tell how much my heart suffered for my\r\npeople while at Leavenworth. The Great Spirit Chief who rules above\r\nseemed to be looking some other way, and did not see what was being done\r\nto my people.\"\r\n\r\nYet with a marvellous magnanimity, and a clear-headed sense of justice\r\nof which few men would be capable under the circumstances, Joseph says:\r\n\"I believe General Miles would have kept his word if he could have done\r\nso. I do not blame him for what we have suffered since the surrender. I\r\ndo not know who is to blame. We gave up all our horses, over eleven\r\nhundred, and all our saddles, over one hundred, and we have not heard\r\nfrom them since. Somebody has got our horses.\"\r\n\r\nThis narrative of Chief Joseph's is profoundly touching; a very Iliad of\r\ntragedy, of dignified and hopeless sorrow; and it stands supported by\r\nthe official records of the Indian Bureau.\r\n\r\n\"After the arrival of Joseph and his band in Indian Territory, the bad\r\neffect of their location at Fort Leavenworth manifested itself in the\r\nprostration by sickness at one time of two hundred and sixty out of the\r\nfour hundred and ten; and 'within a few months' in the death of 'more\r\nthan one-quarter of the entire number.'\"[17]\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Annual Report of the Indian Commissioner for 1878, p. 33.\r\n\r\n\"It will be borne in mind that Joseph has never made a treaty with the\r\nUnited States, and that he has never surrendered to the Government the\r\nlands he claimed to own in Idaho. *** Joseph and his followers have\r\nshown themselves to be brave men and skilful soldiers, who, with one\r\nexception, have observed the rules of civilized warfare. *** These\r\nIndians were encroached upon by white settlers, on soil they believed to\r\nbe their own, and when these encroachments became intolerable, they were\r\ncompelled in their own estimation to take up arms.\"[18]\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  Same Report, p. 34.\r\n\r\nChief Joseph and a remnant of his band are still in Indian Territory,\r\nwaiting anxiously the result of the movement now being made by the Ponca\r\nchief, Standing Bear, and his friends and legal advisers, to obtain from\r\nthe Supreme Court a decision which will extend the protection of the\r\ncivil law to every Indian in the country.\r\n\r\nOf the remainder of the Nez Percés (those who are on the Lapwai\r\nReservation), the report of the Indian Bureau for 1879 is that they\r\n\"support themselves entirely without subsistence from the Government;\r\nprocure of their own accord, and at their own expense, wagons, harness,\r\nand other farming implements beyond the amount furnished by the\r\nGovernment under their treaty,\" and that \"as many again as were taught\r\nwere turned away from school for lack of room.\"\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions has contributed during this\r\nyear $1750 for missionary work among them, and the Indians themselves\r\nhave raised $125.\r\n\r\nTheir reservation is thus described: \"The majority of land comprising\r\nthe reservation is a vast rolling prairie, affording luxuriant pasturage\r\nfor thousands of their cattle and horses. The Clearwater River, flowing\r\nas it does directly through the reserve, branching out in the North,\r\nMiddle, and South Forks, greatly benefits their locations that they have\r\ntaken in the valleys lying between such river and the bluffs of the\r\nhigher land, forming in one instance—at Kaimaih—one of the most\r\npicturesque locations to be found in the whole North-west. Situated in a\r\nvalley on either side of the South Fork, in length about six miles,\r\nvarying in width from one-half to two miles; in form like a vast\r\namphitheatre, surrounded on all sides by nearly perpendicular bluffs\r\nrising two thousand feet in height, it forms one of the prettiest\r\nvalleys one can imagine. A view from the bluff reveals a living\r\npanorama, as one sees the vast fields of waving grain surrounding\r\nwell-built and tasty cottages adorned with porches, and many of the\r\nconveniences found among industrious whites. The sight would lead a\r\nstranger, not knowing of its inhabitance by Indians, to inquire what\r\nprosperous white settlement was located here. It is by far the most\r\nadvanced in the ways of civilization and progress of any in the\r\nTerritory, if not on the coast.\"\r\n\r\nHow long will the white men of Idaho permit Indians to occupy so fair a\r\ndomain as this? The small cloud, no larger than a man's hand, already\r\nlooms on their horizon. The closing paragraph of this (the last) report\r\nfrom the Nez Percés is:\r\n\r\n\"Some uneasiness is manifest about stories set afloat by renegade\r\nwhites, in relation to their treatment at the expiration of their treaty\r\nnext July, but I have talked the matter over, and they will wait\r\npatiently to see the action on the part of the Government. They are well\r\ncivilized; but one mistake on the part of the Government at this time\r\nwould destroy the effects of the past thirty years' teachings. Give them\r\ntime and attention; they will astonish their most zealous friends in\r\ntheir progress toward civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                               THE SIOUX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word Sioux is a contraction from the old French word \"Nadouessioux,\"\r\nor \"Enemies,\" the name given by the French traders to this most powerful\r\nand warlike of all the North-western tribes. They called themselves\r\n\"Dakota,\" or \"many in one,\" because so many bands under different names\r\nwere joined together. At the time of Captain Carver's travels among the\r\nNorth American Indians there were twelve known bands of these\r\n\"Nadouwessies.\" They entertained the captain most hospitably for seven\r\nmonths during the winter of 1766-'7; adopted him as one of their chiefs;\r\nand when the time came for him to depart, three hundred of them\r\naccompanied him for a distance on his journey, and took leave with\r\nexpressions of friendship for him, and good-will toward the Great\r\nFather, the English king, of whom he had told them. The chiefs wished\r\nhim to say to the king \"how much we desire that traders may be sent to\r\nabide among us with such things as we need, that the hearts of our young\r\nmen, our wives, and children may be made glad. And may peace subsist\r\nbetween us so long as the sun, the moon, the earth, and the waters shall\r\nendure;\" and \"acquaint the Great King how much the Nadouwessies wish to\r\nbe counted among his good children.\"\r\n\r\nNothing in all the history of the earliest intercourse between the\r\nfriendly tribes of North American Indians and the Europeans coming among\r\nthem is more pathetic than the accounts of their simple hospitality,\r\ntheir unstinted invitations, and their guileless expressions of desire\r\nfor a greater knowledge of the white men's ways.\r\n\r\nWhen that saintly old bigot, Father Hennepin, sailed up the Illinois\r\nRiver, in 1680, carrying his \"portable chapel,\" chalice, and chasuble,\r\nand a few holy wafers \"in a steel box, shut very close,\" going to teach\r\nthe savages \"the knowledge of the Captain of Heaven and Earth, and to\r\nuse fire-arms, and several other things relating to their advantage,\"\r\nthe Illinois were so terrified that, although they were several thousand\r\nstrong, they took to flight \"with horrid cries and howlings.\" On being\r\nreassured by signs and words of friendliness, they slowly returned—some,\r\nhowever, not until three or four days had passed. Then they listened to\r\nthe good man's discourses with \"great attention; afterward gave a great\r\nshout for joy,\" and \"expressed a great gratitude;\" and, the missionaries\r\nbeing footsore from long travel, the kindly creatures fell to rubbing\r\ntheir legs and feet \"with oil of bears, and grease of wild oxen, which\r\nafter much travel is an incomparable refreshment; and presented us some\r\nflesh to eat, putting the three first morsels into our mouths with great\r\nceremonies.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a pity that Father Hennepin had no more tangible benefit than the\r\ndoctrine of the \"efficacy of the Sacraments\" to communicate to the\r\nhospitable Illinois in return for their healing ointments. Naturally\r\nthey did not appreciate this, and he proceeded on his way disheartened\r\nby their \"brutish stupidity,\" but consoling himself, however, with the\r\nthought of the infants he had baptized. Hearing of the death of one of\r\nthem, he says he is \"glad it had pleased God to take this little\r\nChristian out of the world,\" and he attributed his own \"preservation\r\namidst the greatest dangers\" afterward to \"the care he took for its\r\nbaptism.\" Those dangers were, indeed, by no means inconsiderable, as he\r\nand his party were taken prisoners by a roaming party of these Indians,\r\ncalled in the Father's quaint old book \"Nadouwessians.\" He was forced to\r\naccompany them on their expeditions, and was in daily danger of being\r\nmurdered by the more riotous and hostile members of the band. He found\r\nthese savages on the whole \"good-natured men, affable, civil, and\r\nobliging,\" and he was indebted for his life to the good-will of one of\r\nthe chiefs, who protected him again and again at no inconsiderable\r\ndanger to himself. The only evidence of religion among the Nadouwessies\r\nwhich he mentions is that they never began to smoke without first\r\nholding the pipe up to the sun, saying, \"Smoke, sun!\" They also offered\r\nto the sun the best part of every beast they killed, carrying it\r\nafterward to the cabin of their chief; from which Father Hennepin\r\nconcluded that they had \"a religious veneration for the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic relations between the United States Government and the\r\nSioux began in the year 1815. In that year and the year following we\r\nmade sixteen \"treaties\" of peace and friendship with different tribes of\r\nIndians—treaties demanding no cessions of land beyond the original\r\ngrants which had been made by these tribes to the English, French, or\r\nSpanish governments, but confirming those to the United States;\r\npromising \"perpetual peace,\" and declaring that \"every injury or act of\r\nhostility committed by one or other of the contracting parties shall be\r\nmutually forgiven and forgot.\" Three of these treaties were made with\r\nbands of the Sioux—one of them with \"the Sioux of the Leaf, the Sioux of\r\nthe Broad Leaf, and the Sioux who shoot in the Pine-tops.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1825 four more treaties were made with separate Sioux bands. By one\r\nof those treaties—that of Prairie du Chien—boundaries were defined\r\nbetween the Chippewas and the Sioux, and it was hoped that their\r\nincessant feuds might be brought to an end. This hostility had continued\r\nunabated from the time of the earliest travellers in the country, and\r\nthe Sioux had been slowly but steadily driven south and west by the\r\nvictorious Chippewas. A treaty could not avail very much toward keeping\r\npeace between such ancient enemies as these. Fighting went on as before;\r\nand white traders, being exposed to the attacks of all war-parties,\r\nsuffered almost more than the Indians themselves. The Government\r\nconsoled itself for this spectacle of bloody war, which it was powerless\r\nto prevent, by the thought that the Indians would \"probably fight on\r\nuntil some one or other of the tribes shall become too reduced and\r\nfeeble to carry on the war, when it will be lost as a separate power\"—an\r\nequivocal bit of philosophizing which was unequivocally stated in these\r\nprecise words in one of the annual reports of the War Department.\r\n\r\nIn the third Article of the next treaty, also at Prairie du Chien, in\r\n1830, began the trouble which has been from that day to this a source of\r\nnever ending misunderstanding and of many fierce outbreaks on the part\r\nof the Sioux. Four of the bands by this article ceded and relinquished\r\nto the United States \"forever\" a certain tract of country between the\r\nMississippi and the Des Moines River. In this, and in a still further\r\ncession, two other bands of Sioux, who were not fully represented at the\r\ncouncil, must join; also, some four or five other tribes. Landed and\r\n\"undivided\" estate, owned in common by dozens of families, would be a\r\nvery difficult thing to parcel out and transfer among white men to-day,\r\nwith the best that fair intentions and legal skill combined could do;\r\nhow much more so in those days of unsurveyed forests, unexplored rivers,\r\nowned and occupied in common by dozens of bands of wild and ignorant\r\nIndians, to be communicated with only by interpreters. Misconstructions\r\nand disputes about boundaries would have been inevitable, even if there\r\nhad been all possible fairmindedness and good-will on both sides; but in\r\nthis case there was only unfairmindedness on one side, and unwillingness\r\non the other. All the early makers of treaties with the Indians\r\ncongratulated themselves and the United States on the getting of acres\r\nof valuable land by the million for next to nothing, and, as years went\r\non, openly lamented that \"the Indians were beginning to find out what\r\nlands were worth;\" while the Indians, anxious, alarmed, hostile at\r\nheart, seeing themselves harder and harder pressed on all sides, driven\r\n\"to provide other sources for supplying their wants besides those of\r\nhunting, which must soon entirely fail them,\"[19] yielded mile after\r\nmile with increasing sense of loss, which they were powerless to\r\nprevent, and of resentment which it would have been worse than impolitic\r\nfor them to show.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Treaty of Prairie du Chien.\r\n\r\nThe first annuities promised to the Sioux were promised by this\r\ntreaty—$3000 annually for ten years to the Yankton and Santee bands; to\r\nthe other four, $2000. The Yankton and Santee bands were to pay out of\r\ntheir annuity $100 yearly to the Otoes, because part of some land which\r\nwas reserved for the half-breeds of the tribe had originally belonged to\r\nthe Otoes. \"A blacksmith, at the expense of the United States; also,\r\ninstruments for agricultural purposes; and iron and steel to the amount\r\nof $700 annually for ten years to some of the bands, and to the amount\r\nof $400 to the others; also, $3000 a year 'for educational purposes,'\r\nand $3000 in presents distributed at the time,\" were promised them.\r\n\r\nIt was soon after these treaties that the artist Catlin made his famous\r\njourneys among the North American Indians, and gave to the world an\r\ninvaluable contribution to their history, perpetuating in his pictures\r\nthe distinctive traits of their faces and their dress, and leaving on\r\nrecord many pages of unassailable testimony as to their characteristics\r\nin their native state. He spent several weeks among the Sioux, and says\r\nof them: \"There is no tribe on the continent of finer looking men, and\r\nfew tribes who are better and more comfortably clad and supplied with\r\nthe necessaries of life. *** I have travelled several years already\r\namong these people, and I have not had my scalp taken, nor a blow struck\r\nme, nor had occasion to raise my hand against an Indian; nor has my\r\nproperty been stolen as yet to my knowledge to the value of a shilling,\r\nand that in a country where no man is punishable by law for the crime of\r\nstealing. *** That the Indians in their native state are drunken, is\r\nfalse, for they are the only temperance people, literally speaking, that\r\never I saw in my travels, or expect to see. If the civilized world are\r\nstartled at this, it is the fact that they must battle with, not with\r\nme. These people manufacture no spirituous liquor themselves, and know\r\nnothing of it until it is brought into their country, and tendered to\r\nthem by Christians.\r\n\r\n\"That these people are naked, is equally untrue, and as easily disproved\r\nwith the paintings I have made, and with their beautiful costumes which\r\nI shall bring home. I shall be able to establish the fact that many of\r\nthese people dress not only with clothes comfortable for any latitude,\r\nbut that they dress also with some considerable taste and elegance. ***\r\nNor am I quite sure that they are entitled to the name of 'poor' who\r\nlive in a country of boundless green fields, with good horses to ride;\r\nwhere they are all joint tenants of the soil together; where the Great\r\nSpirit has supplied them with an abundance of food to eat.\"\r\n\r\nCatlin found six hundred families of the Sioux camped at one time around\r\nFort Pierre, at the mouth of the Teton River, on the west bank of the\r\nMissouri. There were some twenty bands, each with their chief, over whom\r\nwas one superior chief, called Ha-won-je-tah (the One Horn), whose\r\nportrait is one of the finest in Catlin's book. This chief took his\r\nname, \"One Horn,\" from a little shell which he wore always on his neck.\r\nThis shell had descended to him from his father, and he said \"he valued\r\nit more than anything which he possessed:\" affording a striking instance\r\nof the living affection which these people often cherish for the dead,\r\ninasmuch as he chose to carry this name through life in preference to\r\nmany others and more honorable ones he had a right to have taken from\r\ndifferent battles and exploits of his extraordinary life. He was the\r\nfleetest man in the tribe; \"could run down a buffalo, which he had often\r\ndone on his own legs, and drive his arrow to the heart.\"\r\n\r\nThis chief came to his death, several years later, in a tragic way. He\r\nhad been in some way the accidental cause of the death of his only son—a\r\nvery fine youth—and so great was the anguish of his mind at times that\r\nhe became insane. In one of these moods he mounted his favorite\r\nwar-horse, with his bow and arrows in his hand, and dashed off at full\r\nspeed upon the prairies, repeating the most solemn oath that he would\r\nslay the first living thing that fell in his way, be it man or beast,\r\nfriend or foe. No one dared follow him, and after he had been absent an\r\nhour or two his horse came back to the village with two arrows in its\r\nbody covered with blood. Fears of the most serious kind were now\r\nentertained for the fate of the chief, and a party of warriors\r\nimmediately mounted their horses and retraced the animal's tracks to the\r\nplace of the tragedy, where they found the body of their chief horribly\r\nmangled and gored by a buffalo-bull, whose carcass was stretched by the\r\nside of him.\r\n\r\nA close examination of the ground was then made by the Indians, who\r\nascertained by the tracks that their unfortunate chief, under his\r\nunlucky resolve, had met a buffalo-bull in the season when they are very\r\nstubborn, and unwilling to run from any one, and had incensed the animal\r\nby shooting a number of arrows into him, which had brought him into\r\nfurious combat. The chief had then dismounted and turned his horse\r\nloose, having given it a couple of arrows from his bow, which sent it\r\nhome at full speed, and then had thrown away his bow and quiver,\r\nencountering the infuriated animal with his knife alone, and the\r\ndesperate battle had resulted in the death of both. Many of the bones of\r\nthe chief were broken, and his huge antagonist lay dead by his side,\r\nweltering in blood from a hundred wounds made by the chief's long and\r\ntwo-edged knife.\r\n\r\nHad the provisions of these first treaties been fairly and promptly\r\ncarried out, there would have been living to-day among the citizens of\r\nMinnesota thousands of Sioux families, good and prosperous farmers and\r\nmechanics, whose civilization would have dated back to the treaty of\r\nPrairie du Chien.\r\n\r\nIn looking through the records of the expenditures of the Indian Bureau\r\nfor the six years following this treaty, we find no mention of any\r\nspecific provisions for the Sioux in the matter of education. The $3000\r\nannually which the treaty promised should be spent \"on account of the\r\nchildren of the said tribes and bands,\" is set down as expended on the\r\n\"Choctaw Academy,\" which was in Kentucky. A very well endowed\r\ninstitution that must have been, if we may trust to the fiscal reports\r\nof the Indian Bureau. In the year 1836 there were set down as expended\r\non this academy: On account of the Miamis, $2000; the Pottawattomies,\r\n$5000; the Sacs, Foxes, and others, $3000; the Choctaws, $10,000; the\r\nCreeks, east, $3000; the Cherokees, west, $2000; the Florida Indians,\r\n$1000; the Quapaws, $1000; the Chickasaws, $3000; the Creeks, $1000:\r\nbeing a total of $31,000.\r\n\r\nThere were in this year one hundred and fifty-six pupils at the Choctaw\r\nAcademy, sixteen of them being from the Sacs, Foxes, Sioux, and others\r\nrepresented in the Treaty of Prairie du Chien of 1830. For the education\r\nof these sixteen children, therefore, these tribes paid $3000 a year.\r\nThe Miamis paid more in proportion, having but four youths at school,\r\nand $2000 a year charged to them. The Pottawattomies, on a treaty\r\nprovision of $5000, educated twenty.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Congress appropriated $2000 \"for the purpose of extinguishing\r\nthe Indian title between the State of Missouri and the Missouri River.\r\nThe land owned here by the Indians was a long, narrow belt of country,\r\nseparated from the rest of the Indian country by the Missouri River. The\r\nimportance of it to the State of Missouri was evident—an \"obvious\r\nconvenience and necessity.\" The citizens of Missouri made\r\nrepresentations to this effect; and though the President is said to have\r\nbeen \"unwilling to assent, as it would be in disregard of the guarantee\r\ngiven to the Indians in the Treaty of Prairie du Chien, and might be\r\nconsidered by them as the first step in a series of efforts to obtain\r\npossession of their new country,\" he nevertheless consented that the\r\nquestion of such a cession should be submitted to them. Accordingly,\r\nnegotiations were opened, and nearly all the Indians who had rights in\r\nthese lands, \"seeing that from their local position they could never be\r\nmade available for Indian purposes,\" relinquished them.[20]\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  For this relinquishment the Government gave to the Lower Sioux\r\n  presents to the amount of $400, and to the upper bands $530 in goods.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 the Government invited deputations of chiefs from many of the\r\nprincipal tribes to come to Washington. It was \"believed to be important\r\nto exhibit\" to them \"the strength of the nation they would have to\r\ncontend with\" if they ventured to attack our borders, \"and at the same\r\ntime to impress upon them the advantages which flow from civilization.\"\r\nAmong these chiefs came thirty chiefs and headmen of the Sioux; and,\r\nbeing duly \"impressed,\" as was most natural, concluded treaties by which\r\nthey ceded to the United States \"all their land east of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, and all their islands in the same.\" These chiefs all belonged to\r\nthe Medawakanton band, \"community of the Mysterious Lakes.\"\r\n\r\nThe price of this cession was $300,000, to be invested for them, and the\r\ninterest upon this sum, at five per cent., to be paid to them \"annually\r\nforever;\" $110,000 to be distributed among the persons of mixed blood in\r\nthe tribe; $90,000 to be devoted to paying the just debts of the tribe;\r\n$8230 to be expended annually for twenty years in stock, implements, on\r\nphysicians, farmers, blacksmiths, etc.; $10,000 worth of tools, cattle,\r\netc., to be given to them immediately, \"to enable them to break up and\r\nimprove their lands;\" $5300 to be expended annually for twenty years in\r\nfood for them, \"to be delivered at the expense of the United States;\"\r\n$6000 worth of goods to be given to them on their arrival at St. Louis.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 the Indian Bureau reports that all the stipulations of this\r\ntreaty have been complied with, \"except those which appropriate $8230 to\r\nbe expended annually in the purchase of medicines, agricultural\r\nimplements, and stock; and for the support of a physician, farmers, and\r\nblacksmiths,\" and \"bind the United States to supply these Sioux as soon\r\nas practicable with agricultural implements, tools, cattle, and such\r\nother articles as may be useful to them, to an amount not exceeding\r\n$10,000, to enable them to break up and improve their lands.\" The\r\nfulfilment or non-fulfilment of these stipulations has been left to the\r\ndiscretion of the agent; and the agent writes that it \"must be obvious\r\nto any one that a general personal intercourse\" on his part \"is\r\nimpracticable,\" and that \"his interviews with many of the tribes must\r\nresult from casualty and accident.\" This was undoubtedly true; but it\r\ndid not, in all probability, occur to the Indians that it was a good and\r\nsufficient reason for their not receiving the $18,000 worth of goods\r\npromised.\r\n\r\nFive thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine dollars were expended the\r\nnext year under this provision of the treaty, and a few Indians, who\r\n\"all labored with the hoe,\" raised their own crops without assistance.\r\nSix thousand bushels of corn in all were housed for the winter; but the\r\nexperiment of turning hunters into farmers in one year was thought not\r\nto be, on the whole, an encouraging one. The \"peculiar habits of\r\nindolence, and total disregard and want of knowledge of the value and\r\nuses of time and property,\" the agent says, \"almost forbid hope.\" A more\r\nreasonable view of the situation would have seen in it very great hope.\r\nThat out of five hundred warriors a few score should have been already\r\nfound willing to work was most reassuring, and promised well for the\r\nfuture of the tribe.\r\n\r\nFor the next ten years affairs went on badly with the Sioux; they were\r\ncontinually attacked by the Chippewas, Ottawas, and others, and\r\ncontinually retaliated. The authorities took a sensible view of this\r\nstate of things, as being the easiest way of securing the safety of the\r\nwhites. \"So long as they (the Indians) are at war with each other they\r\nwill not feel a disposition to disturb the peace and safety of our\r\nexposed frontier settlements,\" wrote Governor Dodge, in 1840.\r\n\r\nWhiskey traders flocked faster and faster into the neighborhood; fur\r\ntraders, also, found it much more for their interest to trade with\r\ndrunken Indians than with sober ones, and the Sioux grew rapidly\r\ndemoralized. Their annuities were in arrears; yet this almost seemed\r\nless a misfortune than a blessing, since both money, goods, and\r\nprovisions were so soon squandered for whiskey.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 several of the bands were reduced to a state of semi-starvation\r\nby the failure of corn crops, and also by the failure of the Senate to\r\nratify a treaty they had made with Governor Doty in 1841.[21] Depending\r\non the annuities promised in this treaty, they had neglected to make\r\ntheir usual provisions for the winter. Frosts, which came in June, and\r\ndrought, which followed in July, combined to ruin their crops. For\r\nseveral years the water had been rapidly decreasing in all the lakes and\r\nstreams north-west of Traverse de Sioux: the musk-rat ponds, from which\r\nthe Indians used to derive considerable revenue, had dried up, and the\r\nmusk-rats had gone, nobody knew where; the beaver, otter, and other\r\nfurry creatures had been hunted down till they were hard to find; the\r\nbuffalo had long since been driven to new fields, far distant. Many of\r\nthe Indians were too poor to own horses on which to hunt. They were two\r\nhundred miles from the nearest place where corn could be obtained, even\r\nif they had money to pay for it. Except for some assistance from the\r\nGovernment, they would have died by hundreds in the winter of this year.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Never ratified.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the \"needs\" of the white settlers on the east side of the\r\nMississippi made it imperative that the Sioux should be again removed\r\nfrom their lands. \"The desirable portions of Minnesota east of the\r\nMississippi were already so occupied by a white population as to seem to\r\nrender it absolutely necessary to obtain without delay a cession from\r\nthe Indians on the west side of the river, for the accommodation of our\r\ncitizens emigrating to that quarter, a large portion of whom would\r\nprobably be compelled to precipitate themselves on that side of the\r\nMississippi.\"\r\n\r\nCommissioners were accordingly sent to treat with the Indians owning\r\nthese desired lands. In the instructions given to these commissioners\r\nthere are some notable sentences: \"Though the proposed purchase is\r\nestimated to contain some twenty millions of acres, and some of it no\r\ndoubt of excellent quality,\" there are \"sound reasons why it is\r\ncomparatively valueless to the Indians, and a large price should not be\r\npaid for it.\" Alive to the apparent absurdity of the statement that\r\nlands which are \"absolutely necessary\" for white farmers are\r\n\"comparatively valueless\" to Indians whom the Government is\r\ntheoretically making every effort to train into farmers, and who have\r\nfor the last ten years made appreciable progress in that direction, the\r\ncommissioner adds, \"With respect to its being valuable to the United\r\nStates, it is more so for the purpose of making room for our emigrating\r\ncitizens than for any other; and only a small part of it is now actually\r\nnecessary for that object. *** The extent of the proposed cession should\r\nbe no criterion of the amount that should be paid for it. On a full\r\nconsideration of the whole matter, it is the opinion of this office that\r\nfrom two to two and a half cents an acre would be an ample equivalent\r\nfor it.\" Some discretion is left to the commissioners as to giving more\r\nthan this if the Indians are \"not satisfied;\" but any such increase of\r\nprice must be \"based on such evidence and information as shall fully\r\nsatisfy the President and Senate.\"[22]\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  \"Chrysostom was of opinion, and not without reason, that, in\r\n  contracts, as often as we strive earnestly to buy anything for less\r\n  than it is worth, or to have more than our just measure or weight,\r\n  there was in that fact a kind of theft.\"—GROTIUS _on Contracts_.\r\n\r\nReading farther on in these instructions, we come at last to the real\r\nsecret of this apparent niggardliness on the part of the Government. It\r\nis not selfishness at all; it is the purest of philanthropy. The\r\nGovernment has all along been suffering in mind from two conflicting\r\ndesires—\"the desire to give these Indians an equivalent for their\r\npossessions,\" and, on the other hand, \"the well-ascertained fact that no\r\ngreater curse can be inflicted on a tribe so little civilized as the\r\nSioux than to have large sums of money coming to them as annuities.\" ***\r\nOn the whole, the commissioner says that we are called on, \"as a matter\r\nof humanity and duty toward this helpless race, to make every exertion\r\nin our power not to place much money at their discretion.\" The\r\nGovernment is beginning very well in this direction, it must be\r\nadmitted, when it proposes to pay for Mississippi Valley lands in\r\nMinnesota only two and a half cents per acre. \"Humanity and duty\" allied\r\ncould hardly do more at one stroke than that.\r\n\r\nWe cannot ascribe to the same philanthropy, however, the withholding\r\nfrom 1837 to 1850 the $3000 a year which the treaty of 1837 provided\r\nshould be expended \"annually\" as the President might direct, and which\r\nwas not expended at all, because President after President directed that\r\nit should be applied to educational purposes; and there being no evident\r\nand easy way of expending it in that manner, it was allowed to\r\naccumulate, until in 1850 it amounted, according to the report of\r\nGovernor Ramsey, of Minnesota, to $50,000. The governor also thinks\r\nbetter than the United States Government does of the country to be\r\nrelinquished this year by the Sioux. He says that it will be \"settled\r\nwith great rapidity, possessing as it does from its situation\r\nconsiderable prospective commercial as well as agricultural advantages.\"\r\nIt was evidently very cheap at two and a half cents an acre.\r\n\r\nIn this same code of instructions by the Indian Bureau there is a record\r\nof another instance of the Government's disregard of treaty\r\nstipulations. At the time of the treaty of Prairie du Chien, in 1850,\r\nthe Sioux chiefs had requested that a certain tract be set apart and\r\nbestowed upon the half-breeds of their nation. This was provided for in\r\nthe ninth Article of that treaty; but the Government refused to give to\r\nthe half-breeds any title to this land, except \"in the same manner as\r\nother Indian titles are held.\" It was agreed, however, that the\r\nPresident might \"assign to any of said half-breeds, to be held by him or\r\nthem in fee-simple, any portion of said tract not exceeding a section of\r\nsix hundred and forty acres to an individual.\" This tract of land was\r\nknown as the \"Half-breed Reservation on Lake Tepin.\"\r\n\r\nThe half-breeds had made almost unintermitting efforts to have these\r\nassignments made, but the Government had as constantly refused to do it.\r\nThe Indian Bureau now assigns two reasons why this treaty stipulation\r\nwas never fulfilled: 1st, that \"the half-breeds, or most of them, would\r\nbe speculated upon by designing persons, and cheated out of their\r\nreservations;\" 2d, that, \"on account of the quality of the lands, some\r\nwould necessarily have much better reservations than others, which would\r\nengender dissatisfaction and heart-burning among themselves as well as\r\nagainst the United States.\" The Bureau felicitates itself that \"the only\r\ntitle they now have to this land, therefore, is that by which other\r\nIndians hold their lands, viz., the occupant or usufruct right, and this\r\nthey enjoy by the permission of the United States.\" Such being the case,\r\nand as the Government would probably never find it expedient and\r\nadvisable to make the assignment referred to, this tract, whatever may\r\nbe the character of the land, must be and would continue comparatively\r\nworthless to them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it appears that in 1841 one of the three treaties made\r\nwith the Sioux, but not ratified, was with these very half-breeds for\r\nthis same \"valueless\" tract of 384,000 acres of land; that they were to\r\nbe paid $200,000 for it, and also to be paid for all the improvements\r\nthey had made on it; and that the treaty commissioners are still\r\ninstructed \"to allow them for it now whatever sum the commissioners deem\r\nit to be\" fairly worth; \"under no circumstances,\" however, \"to exceed\r\nthe sum stipulated in 1841.\" Putting this all into plain English, it\r\nsimply means that in 1830 the Government promised to let a band of men\r\ntake out tracts of land in fee-simple, and settle down like other men on\r\ntheir homesteads; that for ten years the men begged to do so, and were\r\nrefused; that at the end of ten years, thinking there was no hope of\r\nanything better, they agreed to sell the whole tract back to the\r\nGovernment for $200,000; that this bargain, also, the Government did not\r\nfulfil (the treaties never being ratified), and nine years later was\r\nfound congratulating itself on the fact that, by reason of all these\r\nunfulfilled agreements, the land was still \"held only in the same manner\r\nas other Indian titles are held\"—_i.e._, not \"held\" at all—only used on\r\nsufferance of the Government, and could be taken possession of at any\r\ntime at the Government's pleasure. (This matter was supposed to be\r\nfinally settled in 1854 by a law of Congress; but in 1856 the thing\r\nappears to have been still unsettled. A commission had been sent out to\r\ninvestigate it, and the report was that \"the subject has been one of\r\nsome difficulty and intricacy; but the final report of the commissioners\r\nhas just been received, and steps will be taken at once to cause the\r\nscrip to issue to the parties entitled thereto.\")\r\n\r\nA little farther on in this same notable document is a mention of\r\nanother tract, of which it is now \"desirable to extinguish the title.\"\r\nThis was set apart by the tenth Article of that same old treaty for the\r\nhalf-breeds of the Omahas, Otoes, Iowas, and Yankton and Santee Sioux.\r\nThis contains about 143,000 acres, but is \"supposed to be of much less\r\nvalue than that on Lake Tepin much less value than 'valueless;'\" but the\r\n\"amount to be paid for it is left to the discretion\" of the\r\ncommissioners.\r\n\r\nAt this time the bands of the Medewakanton Sioux were occupying a tract\r\nof over two hundred miles along the west shore of the Mississippi,\r\nreaching also some twenty-five miles up the St. Peter's. The Yanktons,\r\nSantees, and other bands lived high up the St. Peter's, reaching over\r\ninto the lands west of the Missouri, out of reach of ordinary facilities\r\nof intercourse. These bands were often in great distress for food, owing\r\nto the failure of the buffalo. They never lost an occasion to send\r\nimploring messages to the Great Father, urging him to help them. They\r\nparticularly ask for hoes, that they may plant corn. In his report for\r\n1850 the superintendent of the territory embracing these Indians says:\r\n\"The views of most of those who have lived the longest among the Indians\r\nagree in one respect—that is, that no great or beneficial change can\r\ntake place in their condition until the General Government has made them\r\namenable to local laws—laws which will punish the evil-disposed, and\r\nsecure the industrious in their property and individual rights.\"\r\n\r\nSuperintendents, agents, commissioners, secretaries, all reiteratedly\r\nrecommending this one simple and necessary step toward civilization—the\r\nIndians themselves by hundreds imploring for titles to their farms, or\r\nat least \"hoes\"—why did the United States Government keep on and on in\r\nits obstinate way, feeding the Indian in gross and reckless improvidence\r\nwith one hand, plundering him with the other, and holding him steadily\r\ndown at the level of his own barbarism? Nay, forcing him below it by the\r\nnewly added vices of gambling and drunkenness, and yet all the while\r\nboasting of its desire to enlighten, instruct, and civilize him. It is\r\nas inexplicable as it is infamous: a phenomenal thing in the history of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1851 the desired treaties were made, the upper and\r\nlower bands of Sioux being treated with separately at Traverse de Sioux\r\nand at Mendota. The upper bands were soon disposed of, though \"some few\r\nof them, having been taught to read,\" had become impressed with the idea\r\nthat their country was of immense value, and at first demanded six\r\nmillion dollars for the lands to be ceded. The treaty with the lower\r\nbands—the Medawakantons and Wahpacootas—was \"exceedingly difficult of\r\nattainment\" on account of, firstly, \"their proximity to the flourishing\r\nsettlements on the east side of the Mississippi producing necessarily\r\nfrequent contact with the whites, whose ideas of the great value of the\r\ncountry had been imparted to these Indians; secondly, their great\r\nexperience in Indian diplomacy, being in the enjoyment already of\r\nliberal annuities under former stipulations\"—all these things rendered\r\nthem as \"indifferent to the making of another treaty at present as the\r\nwhites on their borders were anxious that their lands should be\r\nacquired.\" In consequence of this indomitable common-sense on the part\r\nof the Indians the sessions of the commissioners were tedious and long;\r\nnot until a month had passed did they prevail on these Indians to sign\r\naway the coveted lands, \"the garden-spot of the Mississippi Valley,\" and\r\nthey were obliged to more than treble the number of cents per acre which\r\nthey had been instructed to pay. For thirty-five millions of acres of\r\nland they agreed to pay nominally $3,075,000, which would be between\r\neight and nine cents an acre. But as $2,500,000 was to be held in trust,\r\nand only the interest at five per cent, to be paid to the Indians, and\r\nthis only for the term of fifty years, at which time the principal was\r\nto revert to the Government, it will be easily reckoned that the Indians\r\nwould receive, all told, only about six and one-quarter cents an acre.\r\nAnd taking into account the great value of the relinquished lands, and\r\nthe price the Government would undoubtedly obtain for them, it will be\r\nreadily conceded that Governor Ramsey was not too sanguine when he\r\nstated, in his report to the Interior Department, that the \"actual cost\r\nto the Government of this magnificent purchase is only the sum paid in\r\nhand\" ($575,000).\r\n\r\nThe governor says that it was \"by no means the purpose\" of the\r\ncommission \"to act other than justly and generously toward the Indians;\"\r\nthat \"a continuation of the payment of large sums of interest annually\r\nwould do them no further good \"after fifty years had expired, and would\r\nbe \"inconsistent with sound governmental policy.\" He says that the\r\nDakota nation, although warlike, is \"friendly to the whites,\" and that\r\nit may be reasonably expected that, \"by a judicious expenditure of the\r\ncivilization and improvement funds provided for in these treaties,\" they\r\nwill soon take the lead \"in agriculture and other industrial pursuits.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the provisions of this treaty forbade the introduction of ardent\r\nspirits into the new reservation. This was put in in accordance with the\r\n\"earnest desire\" of the chiefs, who requested that \"some stringent\r\nmeasures should be taken by the Government to exclude all kinds of\r\nliquors from their new home.\"\r\n\r\nBy this treaty the four great bands of Minnesota Sioux were all to be\r\n\"consolidated together on one reservation in the upper part of the\r\nMississippi Valley.\" This region was thought to be \"sufficiently remote\r\nto guarantee\" them against any pressure from the white population for\r\nmany years to come. Farms were to be opened for them, mills and schools\r\nto be established, and dwelling-houses erected. They were to have now a\r\nchance to own \"that domestic country called home, with all the living\r\nsympathies and all the future hopes and projects which people it.\" From\r\nthis time \"a new era was to be dated in the history of the Dakotas: an\r\nera full of brilliant promise.\" The tract of territory relinquished by\r\nthem was \"larger than the State of New York, fertile and beautiful\r\nbeyond description,\" far the best part of Minnesota. It is \"so far\r\ndiversified in natural advantages that its productive powers may be\r\nconsidered almost inexhaustible. *** Probably no tract on the surface of\r\nthe globe is equally well watered. *** A large part is rich arable land;\r\nportions are of unsurpassed fertility, and eminently adapted to the\r\nproduction in incalculable quantities of the cereal grains. The\r\nboundless plains present inexhaustible fields of pasturage, and the\r\nriver bottoms are richer than the banks of the Nile. In the bowels of\r\nthe earth there is every indication of extensive mineral fields.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the assertion made only a few lines before this\r\nglowing paragraph—\"to the Indians themselves the broad regions which\r\nhave been ceded are of inconsiderable value\"—could not be true. It would\r\nseem that for eight thousand people, who, according to this same writer,\r\n\"have outlived in a great degree the means of subsistence of the hunter\r\nstate,\" and must very soon \"resort to the pursuits of agriculture,\"\r\nnothing could have been more fortunate than to have owned and occupied\r\nthirty-five millions of acres of just such land as this.\r\n\r\nThey appear to be giving already some evidence of a disposition to turn\r\nthis land to account. The reports from the different farms and schools\r\nshow progress in farming industry and also in study. The farming is\r\ncarried on with difficulty, because there are only a few carts and\r\nploughs, which must be used in turn by the different farmers, and\r\ntherefore must come to some quite too late to be of use, and there is\r\nmuch quarrelling among them owing to this trouble. Nevertheless, these\r\nbands have raised over four thousand bushels of corn in the year. There\r\nis also a great opposition to the schools, because the Indians have been\r\ntold that the accumulated fifty thousand dollars which is due to them\r\nwould be paid to them in cash if it were not for the schools.\r\nNevertheless, education is slowly progressing; in this year fifty copies\r\nof a little missionary paper called _The Dakota Friend_ were subscribed\r\nfor in the one mission station of Lac qui Parle, and sixty scholars were\r\nenrolled at the school. The blacksmith at St. Peter's reports that he\r\nhas made during the year 2506 pieces of one sort and another for the\r\nIndians, and repaired 1430 more. Evidently a community keeping\r\nblacksmiths so busy as this are by no means wholly idle themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to dwell upon these seemingly trivial details at this\r\npoint in the history of the Minnesota Sioux, because they are all\r\nsignificant to mark the point in civilization they had already reached,\r\nand the disposition they had already shown toward industry before they\r\nwere obliged to submit to their first great removal. Their condition at\r\nthe end of two years from the ratification of these treaties is curtly\r\ntold in the official reports of the Indian Bureau:\r\n\r\n\"The present situation of that portion of the Sioux Indians parties to\r\nthe treaties of July 23d and August 5th, 1851, is peculiar, unfortunate,\r\nand to them must prove extremely injurious. By these treaties they\r\nreluctantly parted with a very large extent of valuable country, which\r\nit was of the greatest importance to the Government to acquire. An\r\ninsignificant portion of it near its western boundary, not deemed\r\nnecessary or desirable for a white population for many years, if at all,\r\nwas agreed to be reserved and assigned to them for their future\r\nresidence. The Senate amended the treaties, striking out this provision,\r\nallowing ten cents an acre in lieu of the reservations, and requiring\r\nthe President, with the assent of the Indians, if they agreed to the\r\namendments, to assign them such tracts of country, beyond the limits of\r\nthat ceded, as might be satisfactory for their future home. To the\r\namendments was appended a proviso 'that the President may, by the\r\nconsent of the Indians, vary the conditions aforesaid, if deemed\r\nexpedient.' The Indians were induced to agree to the amendments;\r\n'confiding in the justice, liberality, and humanity of the President and\r\nthe Congress of the United States, that such tracts of country will be\r\nset apart for their future occupancy and home as will be to them\r\nacceptable and satisfactory.' Thus, not only was the assent of the\r\nIndians made necessary to a country being assigned to them without the\r\nlimits of that ceded, but, by the authority given to the President to\r\nvary the conditions of the amendments to the treaties, he was empowered,\r\nwith the consent of the Indians, to place them upon the designated\r\nreservations, or upon any other portion of the ceded territory, 'if\r\ndeemed expedient.'\r\n\r\n\"To avoid collisions and difficulties between the Indians and the white\r\npopulation which rapidly commenced pouring into the ceded country, it\r\nbecame necessary that the former should vacate at least a large portion\r\nof it without delay, while there was neither the time nor the means to\r\nmake the requisite explorations to find a suitable location for them\r\nbeyond the limits of the cession.\r\n\r\n\"Under these pressing and embarrassing circumstances the late President\r\ndetermined to permit them to remain five years on the designated\r\nreservations, if they were willing to accept this alternative. They\r\nassented, and many of them have been already removed. However\r\nunavoidable this arrangement, it is a most unfortunate one. The Indians\r\nare fully aware of its temporary character, and of the uncertainty as to\r\ntheir future position, and will consequently be disinclined and deterred\r\nfrom any efforts to make themselves comfortable and improve their\r\ncondition. The inevitable result must be that, at the end of the time\r\nlimited, they will be in a far worse condition than now, and the efforts\r\nand expenditures of years to infuse into them a spirit of improvement\r\nwill all have been in vain.\r\n\r\n\"The large investments in mills, farms, mechanic shops, and other\r\nimprovements required by the treaties to be made for their benefit, will\r\nbe entirely wasted if the Indians are to remain on their reservations\r\nonly during the prescribed five years. At the very period when they\r\nwould begin to reap the full advantage of these beneficial provisions\r\nthey would have to remove. Another unfortunate feature of this\r\narrangement, if temporary, is that the Indians will have expended the\r\nconsiderable sums set apart in the treaties for the expenses of their\r\nremoval to a permanent home, and for subsistence until they could\r\notherwise provide it, leaving nothing for these important and necessary\r\npurposes in the event of another emigration. In view of these facts and\r\nconsiderations, no time should be lost in determining upon some final\r\nand permanent arrangement in regard to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Minnesota also writes at this time: \"The doubtful tenure\r\nby which this tribe hold their supposed reservation is well understood\r\nby their chiefs and headmen, and is beginning to give deep\r\ndissatisfaction, and throwing daily more and more obstacles in the way\r\nof their removal. This reservation will not be wanted for white men for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n\"There is not wood, or timber, or coal sufficient for the purposes of\r\ncivilization, except immediately on the St. Peter's and its tributaries.\r\nFrom near the vicinity of the new agency there commences a vast prairie\r\nof more than one hundred miles in extent, entirely destitute of timber,\r\nand I feel confident that we never shall be able to keep any very large\r\nnumber of them at their new agency, or near there.\r\n\r\n\"Already the fund set apart for the removal and subsistence the first\r\nyear of the Sissetons and Wah-pa-tons has been expended, and all their\r\nprovisions eaten up. Seventeen thousand dollars and upward have been\r\nexpended by Governor Ramsey, and one year in advance of the time fixed\r\nby the treaty for their removal. This expenditure was made while he was\r\ngetting them to sign the Senate amendments to the treaty of 1851, which\r\nthey were very reluctant to do, and which not more than half the chiefs\r\nhave signed. These Indians want the Government to confirm this\r\nreservation to them. I would recommend that this be done as the only\r\nmeans to satisfy them, and humanity demands it.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of a helpless people! Forced to give up the\r\n\"garden-spot of the State,\" and accept in its stead an \"insignificant\r\ntract, on the greater part of which there is not wood, or timber, or\r\ncoal sufficient for civilization;\" and then, before the ink of this\r\ntreaty is dry, told that even from this insignificant tract they must\r\npromise to move at the end of five years. What words could characterize\r\nsuch a transaction between man and man? There is not a country, a\r\npeople, a community in which it would be even attempted! Was it less\r\nbase, or more, being between a strong government and a feeble race?\r\n\r\nFrom the infamy of accomplishing this purpose the United States was\r\nsaved. Remonstrances, and still more the resistance of the Indians,\r\nprevailed, and in 1854 we find the poor creatures expressing \"much\r\nsatisfaction\" that the President has decreed that they are to remain\r\npermanently on their \"insignificant tract.\"\r\n\r\nThe Upper Missouri Sioux are still suffering and destitute; a few of\r\nthem cultivating little patches of ground, depending chiefly on the\r\nchase, and on roots and wild berries; when these resources fail there is\r\nnothing left for them but to starve, or to commit depredations on white\r\nsettlers. Some of the bands, nevertheless, have scrupulously observed\r\nthe stipulations of the Fort Laramie treaty in 1851, show a \"strong\r\ndesire for improvement,\" and are on the most friendly terms with the\r\nwhites. These peaceable and friendly bands are much distressed, as well\r\nthey may be, at the reckless course pursued by others of their tribe.\r\nThey welcome the presence of the soldiers sent to chastise the\r\noffenders, and gladly render all the service to them they can, even\r\nagainst their relatives and friends.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 it is stated that \"various causes have combined to prevent the\r\nMinnesota Sioux from deriving, heretofore, much substantial benefit from\r\nthe very liberal provisions of the treaties of 1851. Until after the\r\nreservations were permanently assured to the Indians (1854) it would\r\nhave been highly improper to have made the expenditures for permanent\r\nimprovements, and since then the affairs of the agency have not been\r\nfree from confusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Large sums of money have been expended for these Sioux, but they have\r\nbeen indolent, extravagant, intemperate, and have wasted their means\r\nwithout improving, or seeming to desire to improve their condition.\"\r\n\r\nBoth these statements are made in grave good faith; certainly without\r\nany consciousness of their bearing on each other. It is not stated,\r\nhowever, what specific means the Sioux could have employed \"to improve\r\ntheir condition,\" had they \"desired\" to do so.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1857 was one which will long be remembered by the citizens\r\nof Minnesota. It was opened by terrible massacres, which were all the\r\nwork of a strolling outcast band of Sioux, not more than fifteen in\r\nnumber. They had been driven out of their tribe some sixteen years\r\nprevious, and had been ever since then leading a wandering and marauding\r\nlife. The beginning of the trouble was a trivial difficulty between one\r\nof the white settlers on Rock River and an Indian. The settler's dog bit\r\nthe Indian, and the Indian shot the dog. For this the white settlers\r\nbeat the Indian severely, and then went to the camp and by force took\r\naway all the guns of the band. This was at a season of the year when to\r\nbe without guns meant simply to be without food, and the Indians were\r\nreduced at once to a condition of great suffering. By some means they\r\neither repossessed themselves of their guns or procured others, and,\r\nattacking the settlement, killed all the inhabitants except four women,\r\nwhom they carried away with them, and treated with the utmost barbarity.\r\nThe inevitable results of such horrors followed. The thousands of\r\npeaceable Indians in Minnesota, who did not even know of this outrage,\r\nwere all held in one common terror and hatred by the general public;\r\nonly the very great firmness and discretion of the military officers\r\nsent to deal with the outbreak saved Minnesota from a general uprising\r\nand attack from all the Sioux bands, who were already in a state of\r\nsmouldering discontent by reason of the non-payment of their annuities.\r\nHowever, they obeyed the demands of the Government that they themselves\r\nshould pursue this offending band, and either capture or exterminate it.\r\nThey killed four, and took three prisoners, and then returned \"much\r\njaded and worn,\" and said they could do no more without the help of\r\nUnited States soldiers; and that they thought they had now done enough\r\nto show their loyalty, and to deserve the payment of their annuities.\r\nOne of the chiefs said: \"The man who killed white people did not belong\r\nto us, and we did not expect to be called to account for the people of\r\nanother band. We have always tried to do as our Great Father tells us.\"\r\nAnother said: \"I am going to speak of the treaty. For fifty years we\r\nwere to be paid $50,000 per annum. We were also promised $300,000 that\r\nwe have not seen. I wish to say to my Great Father we were promised\r\nthese things, but have not seen them yet. Why does not the Great Father\r\ndo as he promised?\"\r\n\r\nThese hostilities were speedily brought to an end, yet the situation was\r\nby no means reassuring for the Indians. But one sentiment seemed to\r\ninspire the whole white population, and this was the desire to\r\nexterminate the entire Indian race.\r\n\r\n\"For the present,\" writes the superintendent, \"it is equally important\r\nto protect the Indians from the whites as the whites from the Indians\r\nand this in spite of the fact that all the leading bands of the treaty\r\nSioux had contributed warriors to go in pursuit of the murderers, had\r\nkilled or captured all they could find, and stood ready to go again\r\nafter the remaining eight, if the United States troops would go also and\r\nassist them. Spite of the exertions of one of the chiefs of the Lower\r\nSioux, \"Little Crow,\" who, the superintendent says, labored with him\r\n\"night and day in organizing the party, riding continually between the\r\nlower and upper agencies,\" so that they \"scarcely slept\" till the\r\nwar-party had set out on the track of the murderers; spite of the fact\r\nthat the whole body of the Sioux, without exception, \"received the\r\nintelligence with as much indignation and disapprobation as the whites\r\nthemselves, and did their best to stand clear of any suspicion of or\r\nconnection with the affair—spite of all this, they were in continual\r\ndanger of being shot at sight by the terrified and unreasoning settlers.\r\nOne band, under the chief Sleepy Eyes, were returning to their homes\r\nfrom a hunt; and while they were \"wondering what the panic among the\r\nwhites meant\" (they having heard nothing of the massacre), were fired\r\ninto by some of the militia volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe next day a white settler was found killed near that spot—presumably\r\nby some member of Sleepy Eyes' band. This excitement slowly abated, and\r\nfor the next four years a steady improvement was visible in the\r\nMinnesota Sioux. Hundreds of them threw aside the blanket—the\r\ndistinctive badge of their wild state; schools were well attended, and\r\nfarms were well tilled. That there was great hostility to this\r\ncivilization, on the part of the majority of the tribe, cannot be\r\ndenied; but that was only natural—the inevitable protest of a\r\nhigh-spirited and proud race against abandoning all its race\r\ndistinctions. When we see the men of Lorraine, or of Montenegro, ready\r\nto die for the sake merely of being called by the name of one power\r\nrather than by that of another, we find it heroic, and give them our\r\nsympathies; but when the North American Indian is ready to die rather\r\nthan wear the clothes and follow the ways of the white man, we feel for\r\nhim only unqualified contempt, and see in his instinct nothing more than\r\na barbarian's incapacity to appreciate civilization. Is this just?\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, visiting these Sioux,\r\nreports: \"I was much surprised to find so many of the Sioux Indians\r\nwearing the garb of civilization, many of them living in frame or brick\r\nhouses, some of them with stables or out-houses, and their fields\r\nindicating considerable knowledge of agriculture. Their condition,\" he\r\nsays, \"affords abundant evidence of what may be accomplished among the\r\nSioux Indians by steadily adhering to a uniform, undeviating policy.\r\n\r\n\"The number that live by agricultural pursuits is yet small compared\r\nwith the whole; but their condition is so much better than that of the\r\nwild Indian, that they, too, are becoming convinced that it is the\r\nbetter way to live; and many are coming in, asking to have their hair\r\ncut, and for a suit of clothes, and to be located on a piece of land\r\nwhere they can build a house and fence in their fields.\"\r\n\r\nMany more of them would have entered on the agricultural life had the\r\nGovernment provided ways and means for them to do so. In this same\r\nreport is a mention of one settlement of two thousand Indians at Big\r\nStone Lake, who \"have been hitherto almost entirely neglected. These\r\npeople complain that they have lived upon promises for the last ten\r\nyears, and are really of opinion that white men never perform what they\r\npromise. Many of them would go to work if they had any reasonable\r\nencouragement.\"\r\n\r\nThe annuities are still in arrears. Every branch of the industries and\r\nimprovements attempted suffers for want of the promised funds, and from\r\ndelays in payments expected. The worst result, however, of these delays\r\nin the fulfilment of treaty stipulations was the effect on the Indians.\r\nA sense of wrong in the past and distrust for the future was ever\r\ndeepening in their minds, and preparing them to be suddenly thrown by\r\nany small provocation into an antagonism and hostility grossly\r\ndisproportionate to the apparent cause. This was the condition of the\r\nMinnesota Sioux in the summer of 1862.[23]\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Art. VI.\r\n\r\nThe record of the massacres of that summer is scarcely equalled in the\r\nhistory of Indian wars. Early in August some bands of the Upper Sioux,\r\nwho had been waiting at their agency nearly two months for their annuity\r\npayments, and had been suffering greatly for food during that time—so\r\nmuch so that \"they dug up roots to appease their hunger, and when corn\r\nwas turned out to them they devoured it uncooked, like wild\r\nanimals\"—became desperate, broke into the Government warehouse, and took\r\nsome of the provisions stored there. This was the real beginning of the\r\noutbreak, although the first massacre was not till the 18th. When that\r\nbegan, the friendly Indians were powerless to resist—in fact, they were\r\nthreatened with their lives if they did not join. Nevertheless, some of\r\nthem rescued whole families, and carried them to places of safety;\r\nothers sheltered and fed women and children in their own lodges; many\r\nfled, leaving all their possessions behind—as much victims of the\r\noutbreak as the Minnesota people themselves. For three days the hostile\r\nbands, continually re-enforced, went from settlement to settlement,\r\nkilling and plundering. A belt of country nearly two hundred miles in\r\nlength and about fifty in width was entirely abandoned by the\r\npopulation, who flocked in panic to the towns and forts. Nearly a\r\nthousand were killed—men, women, and children—and nameless outrages were\r\ncommitted on many. Millions of dollars' worth of property were\r\ndestroyed. The outbreak was quickly quelled by military force, and a\r\nlarge number of Indians captured. Many voluntarily surrendered, bringing\r\nwith them over two hundred whites that they had taken prisoners. A\r\nmilitary commission tried these Indians, and sentenced over three\r\nhundred to be hung. All but thirty-nine were reprieved and put into\r\nprison. The remainder were moved to Dakota, to a barren desert, where\r\nfor three years they endured sufferings far worse than death. The\r\nremainder escaped to the Upper Missouri region or to Canada.[24]\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  All the Winnebagoes were removed from Minnesota at the same time.\r\n\r\nMinnesota, at a terrible cost to herself and to the United States\r\nGovernment, was at last free from the presence of Indians within her\r\nborders—Indians who were her enemies only because they had been treated\r\nwith injustice and bad faith.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the bands of Sioux in the Upper Missouri region had\r\nbeen more or less hostile, and military force in continual requisition\r\nto subdue them. Re-enforced by the Minnesota refugees, they became more\r\nhostile still, and in the summer of 1863 were in almost incessant\r\nconflict. In 1864 the Governor of Dakota Territory writes to the\r\nDepartment that the war is spreading into Nebraska and Kansas, and that\r\nif provision is not made for the loyal treaty Indians in that region\r\nbefore long, they also will join the hostiles. One band of the Sioux—the\r\nYanktons—has been persistently loyal, and rendered great service through\r\nall the troubles. Fifty of these Yankton Sioux had been organized by\r\nGeneral Sibley into a company of scouts, and had proved \"more effective\r\nthan twice the number of white soldiers.\" The only cost to the\r\nGovernment \"of this service on the part of the Yanktons had been fifty\r\nsuits of condemned artillery uniforms, arms, and rations in part to the\r\nscouts themselves.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the Government, having spent about $40,000,000 on these\r\ncampaigns, began to cast about for cheaper, if not more humane methods,\r\nand, partly at the instance of the Governor of Dakota, who knew very\r\nwell that the Indians desired peace, sent out a commission to treat with\r\nthem. There were now, all told, some 14,000 Sioux in this region, nearly\r\n2000 being the refugees from Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe report of this commission is full of significant statements. There\r\nseems to be no doubt that the great majority of the Indians are anxious\r\nfor peace; but they are afraid to meet the agents of the Government,\r\nlest they be in some way betrayed. Such bands as are represented,\r\nhowever, gladly assent to a treaty of peace and good-will. The\r\ncommissioners speak with great feeling of the condition of the loyal\r\nYanktons. \"No improvements have been made on their lands, and the\r\ncommissioners were obliged to issue provisions to them to keep them from\r\nstarving. *** No crops met the eye, nor is there the semblance of a\r\nschool-house.\"\r\n\r\nYet by Article four of the treaty with the Yankton Sioux the United\r\nStates Government had agreed to expend $10,000 in erecting a suitable\r\nbuilding or buildings, and to establish and maintain one or more normal\r\nlabor schools; and it is to be read in the United States Statutes at\r\nLarge that in each of the years 1860, 1861, 1862, and 1863, Congress\r\nappropriated $65,000, as per treaty, for the benefit of the Yankton\r\nSioux.\r\n\r\n\"With the exception of a few miserable huts, a saw-mill, and a small\r\namount of land enclosed, there are few vestiges of improvement. *** They\r\nare reduced to the necessity of hunting for a living, and, unless soon\r\nreassured and encouraged, they will be driven to despair, and the great\r\ndiscontent existing among them will culminate in another formidable\r\nIndian war.\"\r\n\r\nNine treaties were concluded by this commission with as many different\r\nbands of Sioux, the Indians pledging themselves to abstain from all\r\nhostilities with each other and with the whites, and the Government\r\nagreeing to pay to the Indians fifteen dollars a head per annum, and to\r\nall who will settle down to farming twenty-five dollars a head.\r\n\r\nIn the winter following these treaties all these Indians faithfully kept\r\ntheir promises, in spite of terrible sufferings from cold and from lack\r\nof food. Some of them were at the old Crow Creek Reservation in Dakota,\r\nwhere they were \"kept from absolute starvation only by the issue to them\r\nof such scanty supplies as could be spared from the stores at Fort\r\nSully, and from the agency.\" It is much to the credit of these Indians\r\nthat, in spite of their manifold sufferings, scarcely a case of stealing\r\noccurred among them, they being determined to keep their faith to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\"They will run like chickens to gather the offal from the slop buckets\r\nthat are carried from the garrison kitchens; while they pass a pile of\r\ncorn and hundreds of loose cattle without touching a thing, except when\r\ntold they may gather up the grains of corn from the ground where the\r\nrats in their depredations have let it fall from the sacks,\" says the\r\nreport of one of the commissioners.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1865 still further treaties were concluded with the\r\nIndians of the plains, and all the Sioux, with the exception of those in\r\nthe British possessions, were now pledged to peace. This summer also saw\r\nthe first recognition on the part of the Government of its flagrant\r\ninjustice toward the friendly Minnesota Sioux who were moved to Crow\r\nCreek, Dakota, at the time of the massacre. There were nearly one\r\nthousand of these—mostly old men, women, and children—many of them the\r\nwidows and children of those who had been hung or were in prison at\r\nDavenport. For three years they had been \"quiet and patient in their\r\nsufferings.\"\r\n\r\nThe two hundred prisoners in Davenport had also shown \"an excellent\r\ndisposition and entire submission,\" although many of them were known and\r\nproved to have been \"absolutely guiltless of any acts of hostility; and\r\nnot only this, but deserving of reward for the rescue of white\r\ncaptives.\" Certificates, petitions, and letters showing these facts were\r\nforwarded from Iowa to the Department, but the commissioner says, in his\r\nreport for 1866, that \"they have been mislaid in their passage through\r\nthe various departments, and cannot be found!\"\r\n\r\nThere was still another class of these Indians deserving of help from\r\nthe Government—some two hundred and fifty friendly farmer Indians, who\r\nwere living in 1862 quietly on their farms, \"who have acted as scouts\r\nfor the Government; who never committed any acts of hostility, nor fled\r\nwith those who did commit them,\" and have still remained friendly\r\nthrough these four years, \"while compelled to a vagabond life by the\r\nindiscriminate confiscation of all their land and property.\"\r\n\r\n\"The crops belonging to these farmer Indians were valued at $125,000,\r\nand they had large herds of stock of all kinds, fine farms, and\r\nimprovements. The United States troops engaged in suppressing the\r\nmassacre, also the prisoners taken by them—in all, some 3500 men—lived\r\nfor fifty days on this property.\"\r\n\r\nStrong efforts were made by Bishop Whipple and others to obtain from the\r\nGovernment some aid for these friendly Indians, and the sum of $7500 was\r\nappropriated by Congress for that purpose. The letter of Bishop Whipple,\r\nwho was requested to report on the division of this sum, is so eloquent\r\na summing up of the case of these Indians, that it ought to be placed on\r\npermanent record in the history of our country. He writes:\r\n\r\n\"There is positive injustice in the appropriation of so miserable a\r\npittance. *** A much larger sum would not pay the amount which we\r\nhonestly owe these men. The Government was the trustee of the Upper and\r\nLower Sioux. It held several millions of dollars for their benefit—the\r\njoint property of the tribes. These friendly Sioux had abandoned their\r\nwild life, and adopted the dress, habits, and customs of civilization;\r\nand in doing this, which placed them in open opposition to the\r\ntraditions of their tribes, they were pledged the protection of the\r\nGovernment. By a mistaken policy, by positive neglect to provide a\r\ngovernment, by the perversion of funds due them for the sale of one-half\r\ntheir reservations, by withholding their annuities until two months\r\nafter they were due (which was caused by the use of a part of these\r\nfunds for claims), by permitting other causes of dissatisfaction to go\r\non unheeded, we provoked the hostility of the wild Indians, and it went\r\non until it ripened in massacre. These farmer Indians had been pledged a\r\npatent for their farms: unless we violated our solemn pledge, these\r\nlands were theirs by a title as valid as any title could be. They had\r\nlarge crops, sufficient to support General Sibley's army for a number of\r\nweeks. They lost all they had—crops, stock, clothing, furniture. In\r\naddition to this, they were deprived of their share in these annuities,\r\nand for four years have lived in very great suffering. You can judge\r\nwhether $5000 shall be deemed a just reward[25] for the bravery and\r\nfidelity of men who, at the risk of their own lives, were instrumental\r\nin saving white captives, and maintained their friendship to the whites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Two thousand five hundred of the seven thousand five hundred dollars\r\n  had been especially set aside by the Government (unjust in its rewards\r\n  as in its punishments) for Chief Other Day, who was really less\r\n  deserving than many others.\r\n\r\n\"I submit to you, sir, and through you hope to reach all who fear God\r\nand love justice, whether the very least we can do for all the friendly\r\nSioux is not to fulfil the pledges we made years ago, and give to each\r\nof them a patent of eighty acres of land, build them a house, and\r\nprovide them cattle, seeds, and implements of husbandry?\"\r\n\r\nIn 1866 all these Sioux were removed, and, in spite of the protestations\r\nof the Nebraska citizens, settled on reservations on the Niobrara River,\r\nin Northern Nebraska. It soon became evident that this place was\r\nundesirable for a reservation, both on account of its previous occupancy\r\nby the whites and scarcity of timber.\r\n\r\nIn the fall they removed again to the mouth of Bazile Creek. Temporary\r\nbuildings were again erected, and here they spent the winters of 1866\r\nand 1867. In February they were cheered by the invitation sent their\r\nchiefs and headmen to visit Washington. They went, feeling sure that\r\nthey should get a home for themselves and people. \"All they got was a\r\npromise that a commission should be sent out to visit them the next\r\nyear.\" They were told, however, to move to Breckenridge, on the west\r\nbank of the Missouri, plant crops there, and were promised that, if they\r\nliked the place, they should have it \"secured to them as a permanent\r\nhome.\" Accordingly, the \"agency buildings\" were once more removed, and\r\ntwo hundred acres of land were planted. Before the crops were harvested\r\nthe commission arrived, and urged the Indians to move farther up the\r\nMissouri. The Indians being averse to this, however, they were allowed\r\nto remain, and told that if they would cultivate the soil like white\r\nmen—take lands in severalty—the Government would assist them. The\r\nIndians gladly consented to this, and signed a treaty to that effect.\r\nBut in 1868 their agent writes: \"That treaty is not yet ratified, and,\r\ninstead of assistance to open farms, their appropriation has been cut\r\ndown one half. After paying for supplies purchased on credit last year,\r\nit is entirely insufficient for clothing and subsistence, and leaves\r\nnothing for opening farms, procuring cattle,\" etc. These Indians, only\r\nfive years previous, had been living on good farms, and had $125,000\r\nworth of stock, implements, etc. No wonder their agent writes: \"Leave\r\nthem without a home a few years longer, and you offer strong inducements\r\nfor them to become idle and worthless.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an intricate and perplexing task to attempt now to follow the\r\nhistory of the different bands of the Sioux tribe through all their\r\nchanges of location and affiliation—some in Dakota, some in Nebraska,\r\nand some on the Upper Arkansas with the hostile Cheyennes and\r\nArapahoes—signing treaties one summer, and on the war-path the\r\nnext—promised a home in spring, and ordered off it before harvest—all\r\nthe time more and more hemmed in by white settlers, and more and more\r\ndriven out of their buffalo ranges by emigrations—liable at any time to\r\nhave bodies of United States soldiers swoop down on them and punish\r\nwhole bands for depredations committed by a handful of men, perhaps of a\r\ntotally distinct band—the wonder is not that some of them were hostile\r\nand vindictive, but that any of them remained peaceable and friendly.\r\nBandied about from civil authorities to military—the War Department\r\nrecommending \"that all Indians not on fixed reservations be considered\r\nat war,\" and proceeded against accordingly, and the Interior Department\r\nneglecting to provide them with \"fixed reservations,\" or to define or\r\nenforce the boundaries of even their temporary reservations—tricked,\r\ncheated on all sides—starving half the time—there is not a tribe of all\r\nthe persecuted tribes of Indians that has a more piteous record than the\r\nSioux. Nevertheless, we find many of the bands, in 1870, advancing in\r\ncivilization. In the Yankton band nearly one hundred children are in\r\nschool, and eight hundred acres of land are under cultivation. The Lower\r\nYanktons are peaceful and quiet, although they are near the Brulés, who\r\nare always roving and hostile. The Sissetons and Wahpetons, who were by\r\na treaty of 1867 placed on reservations in Dakota, are \"industrious, and\r\nfast advancing in agricultural pursuits.\" Four schools are in operation\r\namong them. The Yanktons are \"anxious to farm, and state that the\r\nGovernment has promised to assist and teach them to farm; that they are\r\nand have been ready for some time, but as yet the agent has not received\r\nany instructions or funds to permit of their accomplishing their\r\ndesire.\"\r\n\r\nTwo events, important in the history of the Sioux tribe, happened in\r\n1869 and 1870. One was the visit of a delegation of chiefs and headmen\r\nfrom several of the bands, under the leadership of the chief Red Cloud,\r\nto Washington, Philadelphia, and New York. They had thus an opportunity\r\nof relating all their grievances, and of receiving the Government's\r\ndeclarations of good intentions toward them. Red Cloud, after his return\r\nhome, became an ardent and determined advocate of peace and loyalty. The\r\nother was the withdrawal of a portion of the Santee Sioux from their\r\nband, for the purpose of taking up farms under the Homestead Act, and\r\nbecoming independent citizens. The story of this experiment, and the\r\nmanner in which it was met by the United States Government, is best told\r\nin the words of Dr. Williamson, a missionary, who had lived thirty-five\r\nyears among them, and who pleaded thus warmly for them in a letter\r\naddressed to the Department in the summer of 1870: \"Several\r\nconsiderations have influenced the Dakotas in going to the Big Sioux\r\nRiver: 1st. The soil and climate are more similar to that to which they\r\nhave been accustomed in Minnesota, their former home, than is that of\r\ntheir reservation on the Missouri; 2d. Feeling that they were men\r\ncapable of sustaining themselves if a fair opportunity is afforded them,\r\nthey felt that it was degrading to live as sinecures and pensioners\r\ndependent on Government for food and clothing; 3d. And chiefly a desire\r\nto make homes for their families where they could be subjected to, and\r\nprotected by, the laws of the United States, the same as all other men\r\nare. This they thought could not be the case on their reservation.\r\n\r\n\"These Sioux were parties to the treaties made in 1851, by which they\r\nand other bands ceded to the United States all the best settled parts of\r\nMinnesota west of the Mississippi for less than one-hundredth part of\r\nits present value, and much less than the lands were worth to them as\r\nhunting-grounds. And while as hunters they needed no protection of the\r\nlaw, they knew that as agriculturists they could not live without it;\r\nand they positively refused to sell their hunting-grounds till the\r\nCommissioner of the United States promised that they should be protected\r\nin their persons and property the same as white men. Government never\r\naccorded to them this protection, which, in the view of the Indians, was\r\na very important consideration in selling the lands. This neglect on the\r\npart of the Government led to yearly complaints, and the massacres of\r\n1862. *** These Sioux were most of them previous to the war living in\r\ncomfortable homes, with well-cultivated farms and teams,\" and were\r\nreceiving by annuity provisions, either in money or the equivalent,\r\nabout $50 a head annually, from interest on their money invested in the\r\nbonds of the Government. These Indians, in taking up their new\r\nhomesteads, were required by the Department to renounce, on oath, all\r\nclaims on the United States for annuities. Without doubt, citizenship of\r\nthe United States, the protection of our laws, is worth a great sum; but\r\nis it wise or right in our Government to require these natives of the\r\ncountry to purchase, at a price of several thousands of dollars, that\r\nwhich is given without money or price to every immigrant from Asia,\r\nEurope, or Africa that asks for it?\r\n\r\n\"Besides their annuities, there is due them from the Government the\r\nproceeds of the sale of their old reservation on the Minnesota River,\r\nwhich is more than forty miles long and ten wide; which, after paying\r\nexpenses of survey and sale, are, according to a law of the United\r\nStates, to be expended in assisting them to make homes elsewhere; and as\r\nthese lands were valued at $1.25 an acre and upward, and are rapidly\r\nselling, the portion which will be due each of the Indians cannot be\r\nless than $200 or $300—or $1000 for each family. The oath required of\r\nthem is supposed to bar them from any claim to this also. Now, I cannot\r\nsee how this decision of the Indian Department is consistent either with\r\njustice or good policy, and it is certainly inconsistent with both the\r\nspirit and letter of Articles six and ten of a treaty between the United\r\nStates of America and different bands of Sioux Indians, concluded in\r\n1868, and ratified and proclaimed February, 1869. *** What I ask for\r\nthem is that our Government restore to them a part of what we took from\r\nthem, and give them the same chance to live and thrive which we give to\r\nall the other inhabitants of our country, whether white or black. ***\r\nThat some aid is very necessary must be obvious to you, who know how\r\ndifficult it is for even white men, trained to work, and with several\r\nhundred dollars in property, to open a new farm in this Western\r\nwilderness. Their number is probably greater than you are aware of. When\r\nI administered the Lord's Supper there on the first Sabbath of this\r\nmonth, there were present seventy-seven communicants of our church,\r\nbesides quite a number of other persons. *** It is owing to the Santee\r\nSioux—partly to those on the Big Sioux River, chiefly to those near Fort\r\nWadsworth—that in the last five years not a single white inhabitant of\r\nMinnesota or Iowa has been murdered by the wild Indians, while many have\r\nbeen cut off in every frontier State and Territory south-west of the\r\nMissouri. So long as the Christian Sioux can be kept on the frontier,\r\nthe white settlements are safe. *** In conclusion, I wish again to call\r\nyour attention to the fact that these Indians on the Big Sioux purchase\r\ncitizenship at a very great sum, and to entreat you to do all in your\r\npower to secure for them that protection of person or property for which\r\nthey bargain, and without which nothing our Government can do will make\r\nthem prosperous or happy.\"\r\n\r\nNo attention was paid to this appeal; and the next year the\r\nindefatigable missionary sent a still stronger one, setting forth that\r\nthis colony now numbered fifty families; had been under the instruction\r\nof the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions for many\r\nyears; had a church of one hundred members; a native preacher, partly\r\nsupported by them; had built log-cabins on their claims, and planted\r\nfarms, \"many of them digging up the ground with hoes and spades.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Williamson reiterates the treaty provisions under which he claims\r\nthat these Indians are entitled to aid. The sixth Article of the treaty\r\nof 1868 closes as follows: \"Any Indian or Indians receiving a patent for\r\nland under the foregoing provisions, shall thereby and henceforth become\r\nand be a citizen of the United States, and be entitled to all the\r\nprivileges and immunities of such citizenship, and shall at the same\r\ntime retain all his rights and benefits accruing to Indians under this\r\ntreaty.\"\r\n\r\nThis treaty goes on to provide most liberally for all Indians adopting\r\nthe civilized mode of life. Article eighth specially provides for\r\nsupplying them with seed and agricultural implements, and this is what\r\nthey most of all need.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement held forth in this treaty was one great motive in\r\nleading these people to break tribal influences, so deleterious to\r\nimprovement, and adopt our democratic civilization. Is it not base\r\ntyranny to disappoint them? They are the first Sioux, if not the first\r\nIndians in the United States to adopt the spirit and life of our\r\nAmerican civilization. They have of their own accord done just what the\r\nGovernment has been for generations trying to get the Indians to do. And\r\nnow will the Government refuse this helping hand? To our shame, it has\r\nfor two years refused. And why? Because the Indians said, \"If we become\r\ncivilized, it is necessary for us to break up tribal relations, and\r\nsettle down like white men.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the Government at last yielded to this request, and sent out\r\noxen, wagons, ploughs, etc., enough to stock thirty farms. In 1874, Dr.\r\nWilliamson, having been appointed a special agent for them, reports\r\ntheir progress: \"They all live in log-houses and wear citizens' dress.\r\n*** One hundred and nineteen can read their own language fluently. They\r\nall go to church regularly. They have broken one hundred and\r\nseventy-seven acres of new prairie. Twenty new houses have been built.\r\n*** They have cut and hauled two hundred cords of wood, hauling some of\r\nit forty miles to market. *** They have done considerable freighting\r\nwith their teams, going sometimes a hundred miles away. They have earned\r\nthirty-five hundred dollars, catching small furs. *** One Indian has the\r\ncontract for carrying the mail through Flandreau, for which he receives\r\none thousand dollars a year. *** It is but a few miles from Flandreau to\r\nthe far-famed pipe-stone quarry, and these Indians make many little sums\r\nby selling pipes, rings, ink-glasses, etc., made of this beautiful red\r\nstone. *** They are anxious to be taught how to make baskets, mats,\r\ncloth; and the young men ask to be taught the blacksmith and carpenter\r\ntrades.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a community that only five years before had pushed out into an\r\nunbroken wilderness without a dollar of money, without a plough, to open\r\nfarms. \"Without ploughs, they had to dig the sod with their hoes, and at\r\nthe same time make their living by hunting. They suffered severe\r\nhardships, and a number of their best men perished in snow-storms.\r\nBelieving they were carrying out the wishes of the Great Father, as\r\nexpressed in the treaty of 1868, to which they were parties, they were\r\ndisappointed when for three years no notice was taken of them.\" There is\r\nsomething pathetic in the gratitude they are said now to feel for the\r\nniggardly gift of a few oxen, wagons, and ploughs. They have apparently\r\ngiven over all hope of ever obtaining any of the money due them on\r\naccount of their lands sold in Minnesota. No further allusion is made to\r\nit by Dr. Williamson.\r\n\r\nFrom the Yankton Sioux this year comes a remarkable report: \"We have no\r\njail, no law except the treaty and the agent's word, yet we have no\r\nquarrels, no fighting, and, with one or two exceptions, not a single\r\ncase of drunkenness during the year. This I consider remarkable, when we\r\ntake into consideration the fact that the reservation is surrounded by\r\nranches where liquors of all kinds can be obtained.\" Is there another\r\nvillage of two thousand inhabitants in the United States of which this\r\ncan be said?\r\n\r\nIn this year a commission was sent to treat with some of the wilder\r\nbands of Sioux for the relinquishment of their right to hunt and roam\r\nover a large part of their unneeded territory in Kansas and Nebraska.\r\nSome of the chiefs consented. Red Cloud's band refused at first; \"but on\r\nbeing told that the right would soon be taken from them,\" after a delay\r\nof two days they \"agreed to accept,\" merely stipulating that their share\r\nof the twenty-five thousand dollars promised should be paid in horses\r\nand guns. They insisted, however, on this proviso: \"That we do not\r\nsurrender any right of occupation of the country situated in Nebraska\r\nnorth of the divide, which is south of and near to the Niobrara River\r\nand west of the one hundredth meridian.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a significant fact that, when these Sioux gave up this hunting\r\nprivilege, \"they requested that nearly all the $25,000 they received in\r\ncompensation for this relinquishment should be expended in cows, horses,\r\nharness, and wagons,\" says the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1875.\r\n\r\nThere are still some thousand or more of hostile Sioux roaming about\r\nunder the famous chief Sitting Bull—living by the chase when they can,\r\nand by depredations when they must; occasionally, also, appearing at\r\nagencies, and drawing rations among the other Indians unsuspected. The\r\nremainder of the bands are steadily working their way on toward\r\ncivilization. The Santees are a Christian community; they have their\r\nindustrial-schools, Sabbath-schools, and night-schools; they publish a\r\nmonthly paper in the Dakota tongue, which prints twelve hundred copies.\r\nThe Yanktons have learned to weave, and have made cloth enough to give\r\nevery Indian woman in the tribe one good dress. The Flandreau citizen\r\nSioux have a Presbyterian church of one hundred and thirty-five members,\r\nand pay half the salary of the native preacher. On the occasion of an\r\nanniversary meeting of the Dakota missionaries there, these people\r\nraised one hundred dollars to pay for their entertainment. These three\r\nbands are far the most advanced, but all the others are making steady\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the news from the Sioux on the agencies is that, owing to the\r\nfailure of appropriations, the Indian Bureau had been unable to send the\r\nregular supplies, and the Indians, being in \"almost a starving\r\ncondition,\" had been induced, by the \"apparent purpose of the Government\r\nto abandon them to starvation,\" to go north in large numbers, and join\r\nthe hostile camps of Sitting Bull. This was in the spring; again in\r\nmidsummer the same thing happened, and many of the Indians, growing\r\nstill more anxious and suspicious, left their agencies to join in the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nCongress would probably have paid little attention at this time to the\r\nreading of this extract from \"Kent's Commentaries:\" \"Treaties of peace,\r\nwhen made by the competent power, are obligatory on the whole nation. If\r\nthe treaty requires the payment of money to carry it into effect, and\r\nthe money cannot be raised but by an act of the legislature, the treaty\r\nis morally obligatory upon the legislature to pass the law; and to\r\nrepeal it would be a breach of the public faith.\"\r\n\r\nA disturbed and unsettled condition of things prevailed at all the Sioux\r\nagencies, consequent on this state of things. Companies of troops were\r\nstationed at all of them to guard against outbreaks. Owing to lack of\r\nfunds, the Yanktons were obliged to give up their weaving and\r\nbasket-making. At the Standing Rock Agency, after the Indians had\r\nplanted eight hundred and seventy-two dollars' worth of seeds—of corn,\r\npotatoes, and other vegetables—the grasshoppers came and devoured them.\r\n\"Many of these Indians, with their whole families, stood all day in\r\ntheir fields fighting these enemies, and in several places succeeded so\r\nfar as to save a considerable part of their crops.\" The Santees were\r\nmade very anxious and unhappy by fresh rumors of their probable removal.\r\nPublic sentiment at the East, knowing no difference between different\r\ntribes of Sioux, regarded it as maudlin sentimentalism to claim for the\r\nSantees any more rights than for the hostiles that had murdered General\r\nCuster. One of the agents in Dakota writes:\r\n\r\n\"The recent troubles in the Indian country, and the existing uncertainty\r\nas to the future intentions of the Government toward the Indians,\r\noccasion considerable uneasiness among them. *** Reports are circulated\r\nthat no further assistance will be rendered by the Government, as the\r\nGreat Council in Washington refuses to furnish money unless the Indians\r\nare turned over to the War Department. Every inducement is held out to\r\nencourage secession from the agencies, and strengthen the forces of the\r\nhostile camp. It is not surprising that, in view of the non-arrival of\r\nsupplies, and the recent order of the War Department to arrest parties\r\nleaving and arriving, that people less credulous than Indians would feel\r\nundecided and uneasy. *** It must be remembered that the whole Sioux\r\nnation is related, and that there is hardly a man, woman, or child in\r\nthe hostile camp who has not blood relations at one or the other of the\r\nagencies.\"\r\n\r\nContrast the condition into which all these friendly Indians are\r\nsuddenly plunged now, with their condition only two years previous:\r\nmartial law now in force on all their reservations; themselves in danger\r\nof starvation, and constantly exposed to the influence of emissaries\r\nfrom their friends and relations, urging them to join in fighting this\r\ntreacherous government that had kept faith with nobody—neither with\r\nfriend nor with foe; that made no discriminations in its warfare between\r\nfriends and foes; burning villages occupied only by women and children;\r\nbutchering bands of Indians living peacefully under protection of its\r\nflag, as at Sand Creek, in Colorado—no wonder that one of the military\r\ncommander's official reports says, \"The hostile body was largely\r\nre-enforced by accessions from the various agencies, where the\r\nmalcontents were, doubtless, in many cases, driven to desperation by\r\nstarvation and the heartless frauds perpetrated on them;\" and that the\r\nInterior Department is obliged to confess that, \"Such desertions were\r\nlargely due to the uneasiness which the Indians had long felt on account\r\nof the infraction of treaty stipulations by the white invasion of the\r\nBlack Hills, seriously aggravated at the most critical period by\r\nirregular and insufficient issues of rations, necessitated by inadequate\r\nand delayed appropriations.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Sitting Bull made his famous reply: \"Tell them\r\nat Washington if they have one man who speaks the truth to send him to\r\nme, and I will listen to what he has to say.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the military campaign against these hostile Sioux in 1876\r\nand 1877 is to be read in the official records of the War Department, so\r\nfar as statistics can tell it. Another history, which can never be read,\r\nis written in the hearts of widowed women in the Sioux nation and in the\r\nnation of the United States.\r\n\r\nBefore midsummer the Sioux war was over. The indomitable Sitting Bull\r\nhad escaped to Canada—that sanctuary of refuge for the Indian as well as\r\nfor the slave. Here he was visited in the autumn by a commission from\r\nthe United States, empowered by the President to invite him with his\r\npeople to return, and be \"assigned to agencies,\" and treated \"in as\r\nfriendly a spirit as other Indians had been who had surrendered.\" It was\r\nexplained to him that every one of the Indians who had surrendered had\r\n\"been treated in the same manner as those of your nation who, during all\r\nthe past troubles, remained peaceably at their agencies.\" As a great\r\npart of those who had fled from these same agencies to join Sitting Bull\r\nhad done so because they were starving, and the Government knew this\r\n(had printed the record of the fact in the reports of two of its\r\nDepartments), this was certainly a strange phraseology of invitation for\r\nit to address to Sitting Bull. His replies and those of his chiefs were\r\nfull of scathing sarcasm. Secure on British soil, they had for once safe\r\nfreedom of speech as well as of action, and they gave the United States\r\nCommissioners very conclusive reasons why they chose to remain in\r\nCanada, where they could \"trade with the traders and make a living,\" and\r\nwhere their women had \"time to raise their children.\"[26]\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Art. V.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners returned from their bootless errand, and the Interior\r\nDepartment simply entered on its records the statement that \"Sitting\r\nBull and his adherents are no longer considered wards of the\r\nGovernment.\" It also enters on the same record the statement that \"in\r\nthe months of September and October, 1876, the various Sioux agencies\r\nwere visited by a commission appointed under the Act of Congress, August\r\n15th of that year, to negotiate with the Sioux for an agreement to\r\nsurrender that portion of the Sioux Reservation which included the Black\r\nHills, and certain hunting privileges outside that reserve, guaranteed\r\nby the treaty of 1868; to grant a right of way across their reserve; and\r\nto provide for the removal of the Red Cloud and Spotted Tail bands to\r\nnew agencies on the Missouri River. The commission were also authorized\r\nto take steps to gain the consent of the Sioux to their removal to the\r\nIndian Territory. *** The commission were successful in all the\r\nnegotiations with which they were charged, and the Indians made every\r\nconcession that was desired by the Government, although we were engaged\r\nat that very time in fighting their relatives and friends.\" The only\r\ncomment needed on this last paragraph is to suggest that a proper list\r\nof errata for that page should contain: \"For 'although' read 'because!'\"\r\n\"On behalf of the United States the agreement thus entered into provided\r\nfor subsisting the Sioux on a stated ration until they should become\r\nself-supporting; for furnishing schools, and all necessary aid and\r\ninstruction in agriculture and the mechanical arts, and for the\r\nallotment of lands in severalty.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this act, a commission was sent to select a location\r\non the Missouri River for the two new Sioux agencies (the Red Cloud and\r\nSpotted Tail).\r\n\r\n\"For the former the site chosen is the junction of Yellow Medicine and\r\nMissouri rivers, and at that point agency buildings have just been\r\nerected,\" says the Report of the Indian Bureau for 1877. \"For the latter\r\nthe old Ponca Reserve was decided on, where the agency buildings,\r\nstorehouses, one hundred and fifty Indian houses, and five hundred acres\r\nof cultivated fields, left vacant by the Poncas, offer special\r\nadvantages for present quarters.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioner says: \"The removal of fourteen thousand Sioux Indians\r\nat this season of the year, a distance of three hundred miles from their\r\nold agencies in Nebraska to their new quarters near the Missouri River,\r\nis not a pleasant matter to contemplate. Neither the present Secretary\r\nof the Interior nor the present Commissioner of Indian Affairs is\r\nresponsible for the movement, but they have carried out the law\r\nfaithfully though reluctantly. The removal is being made in accordance\r\nwith the Act of August 15th, 1876. It is proper to say here that I\r\ncannot but look on the necessity thus imposed by law on the executive\r\nbranch of the Government as an unfortunate one, and the consequences\r\nought to be remedied as speedily as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Let us for a moment consider that the Spotted Tail Agency was in 1871\r\non the west bank of the Missouri River, where the whites became\r\nexceedingly troublesome, and the river afforded abundant facilities for\r\nthe introduction of intoxicating liquors. In 1874 the Red Cloud and\r\nSpotted Tail agencies were removed to what a subsequent survey proved to\r\nbe the State of Nebraska—the former agency one hundred and sixty-five\r\nmiles from Cheyenne, and the latter one hundred and eight miles from\r\nSidney, the nearest points on the Union Pacific Railroad. Here the usual\r\nill-fortune attending the removal of these Indians was again exemplified\r\nin placing the agencies on absolutely barren land, where there was no\r\npossibility of cultivating the soil, no hope of their being enabled to\r\nbecome self-supporting, and where they have of necessity been kept in\r\nthe hopeless condition of paupers.\"\r\n\r\nIn the hope of placing these Indians upon arable land, where they might\r\nbecome civilized and self-supporting, the determination was hastily\r\ntaken to remove them back to the Missouri River. This step was taken\r\nwithout a proper examination of other points on their reservation, where\r\nit is stated that \"a sufficient quantity of excellent wheat lands can be\r\nfound on either bank of the White River, and where there is also timber\r\nsufficient in quantity and quality for all practical purposes. *** The\r\nIndian chiefs, in their interview with the President in September last,\r\nbegged that they might not be sent to the Missouri River, as\r\nwhiskey-drinking and other demoralization would be the consequence. This\r\nwas the judgment of the best men of the tribe; but the necessity was one\r\nthat the President could not control. The provisions and supplies for\r\nthe ensuing winter had been placed, according to law, on the Missouri,\r\nand, owing to the lateness of the season, it was impossible to remove\r\nthem to the old agencies. Accordingly, the necessities of the case\r\ncompelled the removal of these Indians in the midst of the snows and\r\nstorms of early winter, which have already set in.\"\r\n\r\nIf there were absolutely no other record written of the management of\r\nIndian affairs by the Interior Department than this one page of the\r\nhistory of these two bands of the Sioux tribe, this alone would be\r\nenough to show the urgent need of an entirely new system. So many and\r\nsuch hasty, ill-considered, uninformed, capricious, and cruel decisions\r\nof arbitrary power could hardly be found in a seven years' record of any\r\nknown tyrant; and there is no tyrant whose throne would not have been\r\nrocked, if not upset, by the revolutions which would have followed on\r\nsuch oppressions.\r\n\r\nThere is a sequel to this story of the removal of the Red Cloud and\r\nSpotted Tail bands—a sequel not recorded in the official reports of the\r\nDepartment, but familiar to many men in the Western country. Accounts of\r\nit—some humorous, some severe—were for some time floating about in\r\nWestern newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cloud and Spotted Tail bands of Sioux consented to go to the old\r\nPonca Reserve only after being told that all their supplies had been\r\nsent to a certain point on the Missouri River with a view to this move;\r\nand it being too late to take all this freight northward again, they\r\nwould starve if they stayed where they were. Being assured that they\r\nwould be allowed to go back in the spring, and having a written pledge\r\nfrom General Crook (in whose word they had implicit faith) that the\r\nGovernment would fulfil this promise, they at last very reluctantly\r\nconsented to go to the Ponca Reserve for the winter. In the spring no\r\norders came for the removal. March passed, April passed—no orders. The\r\nchiefs sent word to their friend, General Crook, who replied to them\r\nwith messages sent by a swift runner, begging them not to break away,\r\nbut to wait a little longer. Finally, in May, the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs went himself to hold a council with them. When he rose to speak,\r\nthe chief Spotted Tail sprung up, walked toward him, waving in his hand\r\nthe paper containing the promise of the Government to return them to\r\nWhite Clay Creek, and exclaimed, \"All the men who come from Washington\r\nare liars, and the bald-headed ones are the worst of all! I don't want\r\nto hear one word from you—you are a bald-headed old liar! You have but\r\none thing to do here, and that is to give an order for us to return to\r\nWhite Clay Creek. Here are your written words; and if you don't give\r\nthis order, and everything here is not on wheels inside of ten days,\r\nI'll order my young men to tear down and burn everything in this part of\r\nthe country! I don't want to hear anything more from you, and I've got\r\nnothing more to say to you:\" and he turned his back on the commissioner\r\nand walked away. Such language as this would not have been borne from\r\nunarmed and helpless Indians; but when it came from a chief with four\r\nthousand armed warriors at his back, it was another affair altogether.\r\nThe order was written. In less than ten days everything was \"on wheels,\"\r\nand the whole body of these Sioux on the move to the country they had\r\nindicated; and the Secretary of the Interior says, naïvely, in his\r\nReport for 1868, \"The Indians were found to be quite determined to move\r\nwestward, and the promise of the Government in that respect was\r\nfaithfully kept.\"\r\n\r\nThe reports from all the bands of Sioux for the past two years have been\r\nfull of indications of their rapid and encouraging improvement. \"The\r\nmost decided advance in civilization has been made by the Ogallalla and\r\nBrulé Sioux,\" says the Report of the Indian Bureau for 1879. \"Their\r\nprogress during the last year and a half has been simply marvellous.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet this one band of Ogallalla Sioux has been moved, since 1863,\r\neight times. Is it not a wonder that they have any heart to work, any\r\nhope of anything in the future?\r\n\r\n\"It is no longer a question,\" says this same report, \"whether Indians\r\nwill work. They are steadily asking for opportunities to do so, and the\r\nIndians who to-day are willing and anxious to engage in civilized labor\r\nare largely in the majority; *** there is an almost universal call for\r\nlands in severalty; *** there is a growing desire to live in houses; the\r\ndemand for agricultural implements and appliances, and for wagons and\r\nharness for farming and freighting purposes, is constantly increasing.\"\r\n\r\nThat all this should be true of these wild, warlike Sioux, after so many\r\nyears of hardships and forced wanderings and removals, is\r\nincontrovertible proof that there is in them a native strength of\r\ncharacter, power of endurance, and indomitable courage, which will make\r\nof them ultimately a noble and superior race of people, if civilization\r\nwill only give them time to become civilized, and Christians will leave\r\nthem time and peace to learn Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                              THE PONCAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1803 Captain Lewis and Lieutenant Clarke, of the First United States\r\nInfantry, were commissioned by Congress to explore the river Missouri\r\nfrom its mouth to its source, to \"seek the best water communication from\r\nthence to the Pacific Ocean,\" and to enter into conference with all the\r\nIndian tribes on their route, with a view to the establishment of\r\ncommerce with them. They report the \"Poncars\" as \"the remnant of a\r\nnation once respectable in point of numbers; they formerly resided on a\r\nbranch of the Red River of Lake Winnipeg; being oppressed by Sioux, they\r\nremoved to the west side of the Missouri, on Poncar River, where they\r\nbuilt and fortified a village, and remained some years; but, being\r\npursued by their ancient enemies, the Sioux, and reduced by continual\r\nwars, they have joined and now live with the Mahas (Omahas), whose\r\nlanguage they speak.\" Their numbers are estimated by Lewis and Clarke as\r\nbeing only about two hundred, all told; but this small estimate is\r\nprobably to be explained by the fact that at this time the tribe was\r\naway on its annual buffalo-hunt, and their village had been so long\r\nempty and quiet that a buffalo was found grazing there. A few years\r\nlater the tribe is reckoned at four hundred: in a census of the Indian\r\ntribes, taken by General Porter in 1829, they are set down at six\r\nhundred. The artist Catlin, who visited them a few years later, rated\r\nthem a little less. He gives an interesting account of the chief of the\r\ntribe, named Shoo-de-ga-cha (Smoke), and his young and pretty wife,\r\nHee-la'h-dee (the Pure Fountain), whose portraits he painted. He says:\r\n\"The chief, who was wrapped in a buffalo-robe, is a noble specimen of\r\nnative dignity and philosophy. I conversed much with him, and from his\r\ndignified manners, as well as from the soundness of his reasoning; I\r\nbecame fully convinced that he deserved to be the sachem of a more\r\nnumerous and prosperous tribe. He related to me with great coolness and\r\nfrankness the poverty and distress of his nation—and with the method of\r\na philosopher predicted the certain and rapid extinction of his tribe,\r\nwhich he had not the power to avert. Poor, noble chief, who was equal to\r\nand worthy of a greater empire! He sat on the deck of the steamer,\r\noverlooking the little cluster of his wigwams mingled among the trees,\r\nand, like Caius Marius weeping over the ruins of Carthage, shed tears as\r\nhe was descanting on the poverty of his ill-fated little community,\r\nwhich he told me had 'once been powerful and happy; that the buffaloes\r\nwhich the Great Spirit had given them for food, and which formerly\r\nspread all over their green prairies, had all been killed or driven out\r\nby the approach of white men, who wanted their skins; that their country\r\nwas now entirely destitute of game, and even of roots for food, as it\r\nwas one continuous prairie; and that his young men, penetrating the\r\ncountries of their enemies for buffaloes, which they were obliged to do,\r\nwere cut to pieces and destroyed in great numbers. That his people had\r\nfoolishly become fond of fire-water, and had given away everything in\r\ntheir country for it; that it had destroyed many of his warriors, and\r\nwould soon destroy the rest; that his tribe was too small and his\r\nwarriors too few to go to war with the tribes around them; that they\r\nwere met and killed by the Sioux on the north, by the Pawnees on the\r\nwest, by the Osages and Konzas on the south, and still more alarmed from\r\nthe constant advance of the pale faces—their enemies from the east—with\r\nwhiskey and small-pox, which already had destroyed four-fifths of his\r\ntribe, and would soon impoverish and at last destroy the remainder of\r\nthem.' In this way did this shrewd philosopher lament over the unlucky\r\ndestiny of his tribe, and I pitied him with all my heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe day before Catlin arrived at this village this old chief's son—the\r\nyoung Hongs-kay-de—had created a great sensation in the community by\r\naccomplishing a most startling amount of bigamy in a single day. Being\r\nthe chief's son, and having just been presented by his father with a\r\nhandsome wigwam and nine horses, he had no difficulty whatever in\r\ningratiating himself with the fathers of marriageable daughters, and\r\nhad, with ingenious slyness, offered himself to and been accepted by\r\nfour successive fathers-in-law, promising to each of them two\r\nhorses—enjoining on them profound secrecy until a certain hour, when he\r\nwould announce to the whole tribe that he was to be married. At the time\r\nappointed he appeared, followed by some of his young friends leading\r\neight horses. Addressing the prospective father-in-law who stood nearest\r\nhim, with his daughter by his side, he said, \"You promised me your\r\ndaughter: here are the two horses.\" A great hubbub immediately arose;\r\nthe three others all springing forward, angry and perplexed, claiming\r\nhis promises made to them. The triumphant young Turk exclaimed, \"You\r\nhave all now acknowledged your engagements to me, and must fulfil them.\r\nHere are your horses.\" There was nothing more to be said. The horses\r\nwere delivered, and Hongs-kay-de, leading two brides in each hand,\r\nwalked off with great dignity to his wigwam.\r\n\r\nThis was an affair totally unprecedented in the annals of the tribe, and\r\nproduced an impression as profound as it could have done in a civilized\r\ncommunity, though of a different character—redounding to the young\r\nprince's credit rather than to his shame—marking him out as one daring\r\nand original enough to be a \"Big Medicine.\" Mr. Catlin says that he\r\nvisited the bridal wigwam soon afterward, and saw the \"four modest\r\nlittle wives seated around the fire, seeming to harmonize very well.\" Of\r\nthe prettiest one—\"Mong-shong-shaw\" (the Bending Willow)—he took a\r\nportrait, and a very sweet-faced young woman she is too, wrapped in a\r\nbeautifully ornamented fur robe, much handsomer and more graceful than\r\nthe fur-lined circulars worn by civilized women.\r\n\r\nThe United States' first treaty with this handful of gentle and\r\npeaceable Indians was made in 1817. It was simply a treaty of peace and\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 another was made, in which the Poncas admit that \"they reside\r\nwithin the territorial limits of the United States, acknowledge their\r\nsupremacy, and claim their protection.\" They also admit \"the right of\r\nthe United States to regulate all trade and intercourse with them.\" The\r\nUnited States, on their part, \"agree to receive the Poncar tribe of\r\nIndians into their friendship and under their protection, and to extend\r\nto them from time to time such benefits and acts of kindness as may be\r\nconvenient, and seem just and proper to the President of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this there is little mention, in the official records of the\r\nGovernment, of the Poncas for some thirty years. Other tribes in the\r\nUpper Missouri region were so troublesome and aggressive that the\r\npeaceable Poncas were left to shift for themselves as they best could\r\namidst all the warring and warring interests by which they were\r\nsurrounded. In 1856 the agent of the Upper Platte mentions incidentally\r\nthat their lands were being fast intruded upon by squatters; and in 1857\r\nanother agent reports having met on the banks of the Missouri a large\r\nband of Poncas, who made complaint that all the Indians on the river\r\nwere receiving presents and they were overlooked; that the men from the\r\nsteamboats cut their trees down, and that white settlers were taking\r\naway all their land. In 1858 the Commissioner for Indian Affairs writes:\r\n\"Treaties were entered into in March and April last with the Poncas and\r\nYankton Sioux, who reside west of Iowa, for the purpose of extinguishing\r\ntheir title to all the lands occupied and claimed by them, except small\r\nportions on which to colonize and domesticate them. This proceeding was\r\ndeemed necessary in order to obtain such control over these Indians as\r\nto prevent their interference with our settlements, which are rapidly\r\nextending in that direction. These treaties were duly laid before the\r\nSenate at its last regular session, but were not, it is understood,\r\nfinally acted on by that body.\r\n\r\n\"Relying on the ratification of their treaty, and the adoption of timely\r\nmeasures to carry out its provisions in their favor the Poncas proceeded\r\nin good faith to comply with its stipulations by abandoning their\r\nsettlements and hunting-grounds, and withdrawing to the small tract\r\nreserved for their future home. Being without a crop to rely upon, and\r\nhaving been unsuccessful in their usual summer hunt, they were reduced\r\nto a state of desperation and destitution. As nothing had been done for\r\nthem under the treaty, they concluded it was void, and threatened to\r\nfall back upon their former settlements, some of the most important of\r\nwhich had, in the mean time, been taken possession of by numerous white\r\npersons.\"\r\n\r\nThe Poncas never heard of Grotius or Vattel; but, in assuming that the\r\ntreaty was void because it was not fulfilled, they only acted on the\r\nnatural principles of the law of nations and of treaties, as laid down\r\nby all authorities. Thucydides said: \"They are not the first breakers of\r\na league who, being deserted, seek for aid to others, but they that\r\nperform not by their deeds what they have promised to do upon their\r\noaths.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this delay to fulfil the treaty provisions, the\r\nGovernment was forced to step in at the last moment and \"incur a heavy\r\nexpense\" in furnishing the Poncas with food enough to keep them from\r\nstarving; and in 1859, under this pressure, the Senate ratified the\r\ntreaty. By it the Poncas ceded and relinquished to the United States all\r\nthe lands they had ever owned or claimed, \"wherever situate,\" except a\r\nsmall tract between the Ponca and Niobrara rivers. In consideration of\r\nthis cession, the United States Government agreed \"to protect the Poncas\r\nin the possession of this tract of land, and their persons and property\r\nthereon, during good behavior on their part; to pay them annuities\r\nannually for thirty years—$12,000 for the first five years, then $10,000\r\nfor ten years, then $8000 for fifteen years; to expend $20,000 for their\r\nsubsistence during the first year, for building houses, etc.; to\r\nestablish schools, and to build mills, mechanics' shops, etc.; to give\r\n$20,000 for the payment of the existing obligations of the tribe.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later the agent newly appointed to take charge of the Poncas\r\nreports to the Department the amount of improvements made on the\r\nreservation: \"One saw and grist-mill; two agency houses—story and a half\r\nhouses—without inside lining or plastering, 16 by 26 and 18 by 32 feet\r\nin size; six small round log-houses (three with a small shed for a\r\nstable), a light log-corral for cattle, and a canvas shed for storing\r\nunder; and about sixty acres of ground, broken, comprised all the\r\nimprovements.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently a very small part of the $20,000 had been spent as yet. He did\r\nnot find an Indian on the reservation. From fear of the Sioux (who in\r\n1860 had stolen from them more than half the horses they owned) they had\r\nmoved down the Niobrara River, some twenty miles nearer the Missouri. It\r\nwas with the greatest difficulty that the agent induced them to return;\r\nand after they did so, they huddled their tents close about the agency\r\nbuildings, and could not be induced to go half a mile away unless\r\naccompanied by some of the white employés.\r\n\r\nAs the agent had no food to feed them with, and no money to buy any\r\n(spite of the appropriation of $20,000 for subsistence and\r\nhouse-building), he induced them to go off on a hunt; but in less than a\r\nmonth they came straggling back, \"begging for provisions for their women\r\nand children, whom they had left on the plains half-starved, having been\r\nunable to find any game, or any food except wild-turnips. Some of them\r\nwent to visit the Omahas, others the Pawnees, where they remained until\r\nthe little corn they had planted produced roasting-ears. In the mean\r\ntime those who were here subsisted mainly on wild-cherries and plums and\r\nthe wild-turnip, and traded away most of their blankets and annuity\r\ngoods for provisions.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1863 the reports are still more pitiful. \"They started on their\r\nsummer hunt toward the last of May, immediately after the first hoeing\r\nof their corn. At first they were successful and found buffaloes; but\r\nafterward, the ground being occupied by the Yanktons, who were sent\r\nsouth of the Niobrara by the general commanding the district, and who\r\nwere about double the number, and with four times as many horses, they\r\nsoon consumed what meat they had cured, and were compelled to abandon\r\nthe chase. They commenced to return in the latter part of July. They\r\nwent away with very high hopes, and reasonably so, of a large crop, but\r\nreturned to see it all withered and dried up. In the mean time the\r\nplains had been burnt over, so that they could not discover the roots\r\nthey are in the habit of digging. Even the wild-plums, which grow on\r\nbushes down in ravines and gullies, are withered and dried on the limbs.\r\nThe building I occupy was constantly surrounded by a hungry crowd\r\nbegging for food. *** I am warned by military authority to keep the\r\nPoncas within the limits of the reservation; but this is an\r\nimpossibility. There is nothing within its limits, nor can anything be\r\nobtained in sufficient quantity, or brought here soon enough to keep\r\nthem from starving. *** The Poncas have behaved well—quite as well, if\r\nnot better than, under like circumstances, the same number of whites\r\nwould have done. I have known whole families to live for days together\r\non nothing but half-dried corn-stalks, and this when there were cattle\r\nand sheep in their sight.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time martial law was in force on many of the Indian\r\nreservations, owing to the presence of roving bands of hostile Sioux,\r\ndriven from Minnesota after their outbreak there.\r\n\r\nThe Poncas through all these troubles remained loyal and peaceable, and\r\nwere \"unwavering in their fidelity to their treaty,\" says the Indian\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nIn December of this year what the governmental reports call \"a very\r\nunfortunate occurrence\" took place in Nebraska. A party of Poncas,\r\nconsisting of four men, six women, three boys, and two girls, returning\r\nfrom a visit to the Omahas, had camped for the night about twelve miles\r\nfrom their own reservation. In the night a party of soldiers from a\r\nmilitary post on the Niobrara River came to their camp, and began to\r\ninsult the squaws, \"offering money with one hand, and presenting a\r\nrevolver with the other.\" The Indians, alarmed, pulled up their lodge,\r\nand escaped to a copse of willows near by. The soldiers fired at them as\r\nthey ran away, and then proceeded to destroy all their effects. They cut\r\nthe lodge covers to pieces, burnt the saddles and blankets, cut open\r\nsacks of beans, corn, and dried pumpkin, and strewed their contents on\r\nthe ground, and went away, taking with them a skin lodge-covering,\r\nbeaver-skins, buffalo-robes, blankets, guns, and all the small articles.\r\nThe Indians' ponies were hid in the willows. Early in the morning they\r\nreturned with these, picked up all the corn which had not been\r\ndestroyed, and such other articles as they could find, packed their\r\nponies as best they might, and set off barefooted for home. After they\r\nhad gone a few miles they stopped and built a fire to parch some corn to\r\neat. Some of the women and children went to look for wild-beans, leaving\r\nthree women and a child at the camp. Here the soldiers came on them\r\nagain. As soon as the Indians saw them coming they fled. The soldiers\r\nfired on them, wounding one woman by a ball through her thigh; another,\r\nwith a child on her back, by two balls through the child's thighs, one\r\nof which passed through the mother's side. These women were fired on as\r\nthey were crossing the river on the ice. The soldiers then took\r\npossession of the six ponies and all the articles at the camp, and left.\r\nThe squaws and children who were looking for beans were half a mile\r\nbelow; a little dog belonging to them barked and revealed their\r\nhiding-place in the willows. The soldiers immediately turned on them,\r\ndismounted, and, making up to them, deliberately shot them dead as they\r\nhuddled helplessly together—three women and a little girl!\r\n\r\nOne of the boys, a youth, ran for the river, pursued by the soldiers. On\r\nreaching the river he dived into the water through a hole in the ice; as\r\noften as he lifted his head they fired at him. After they went away he\r\ncrawled out and escaped to the agency. One of the murdered women, the\r\nmother of this boy, had three balls in her head and cheek, her throat\r\ncut, and her head half-severed by a sabre-thrust; another, the youngest\r\nwoman, had her cloth skirt taken off and carried away, and all her other\r\nclothes torn from her body, leaving it naked!\r\n\r\nThe men who did this deed belonged to Company B of the Seventh Iowa\r\nCavalry.\r\n\r\nThe outrage was promptly reported to the Department, and the general\r\ncommanding the Nebraska District detailed an officer to examine into it.\r\nThere was some correspondence between the military authorities relative\r\nto it, but with no result; and in the report of the next year the Indian\r\nCommissioner says: \"Attention was called last year to the fact that the\r\nmurderers of several of this loyal and friendly tribe had not been\r\ndiscovered and punished. I trust that, as there seems to be no\r\nprobability that this will be done, a special appropriation may be made\r\nfor presents to the relatives of the deceased.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1865 a supplementary treaty was made with the Poncas, extending their\r\nreservation down the Niobrara to the Missouri River; and the Government\r\nagreed to pay them $15,000, for the purpose of indemnifying them for the\r\nloss they had sustained in this outrage and in others. For the\r\nratification of this treaty also they waited two years; and in 1867 the\r\nSuperintendent of the Dakota Territory says: \"Schools would have been in\r\noperation at the Ponca Agency before this time but for the long delay in\r\nratifying the supplementary treaty of 1865; and now that this measure\r\nhas fortunately been accomplished, there can be no further necessity for\r\ndelay, and it is confidently believed another year will witness the\r\nfoundation and rapid progress of an English school at this agency.\"\r\n\r\nThis superintendent, having been in office only one year, was probably\r\nnot familiar with the provisions of the treaty of 1859 with the Poncas,\r\nin which, by Article three, the United States Government had promised\r\n\"to establish and maintain for ten years, at an annual expense not to\r\nexceed $5,000, one or more manual labor schools for the education and\r\ntraining of the Ponca youth in letters, agriculture, mechanics, and\r\nhousewifery.\"\r\n\r\nThis educational annuity has but one more year to run, whatever may have\r\nbeen done with it up to this time, it really is now being spent on\r\nschools, and it seems a great pity that it should soon cease. The\r\nGovernor of Dakota, in 1868, evidently thinks so too, for he writes to\r\nthe Department, in the autumn of 1868: \"A school has been in successful\r\noperation at this agency (the Ponca) for the past nine months, with an\r\naverage attendance of about fifty scholars, and with every evidence of\r\nadvancement in the primary department of an English education. But just\r\nat this interesting period of its existence we are notified by the agent\r\nthat with this fiscal year all funds for school as well as for\r\nagricultural purposes cease, agreeably to the terms and conditions of\r\ntheir original treaty. This will be a serious and irreparable calamity\r\nif not remedied by the most generous action of the Government. If funds\r\nfor this purpose cannot be otherwise procured, the Poncas are willing\r\nand anxious to transfer their old reservation to the Government for a\r\nmoderate extension of these important and indispensable benefits.\"\r\n\r\nThe governor also says that in the past year the Poncas have paid out of\r\ntheir annuity money for all the improvements which had been made on\r\nlands occupied by certain white settlers, who were ejected from their\r\nnew reservation by the terms of the last treaty.\r\n\r\nIn the report for 1869 we read that the Ponca school has been\r\n\"discontinued for want of funds.\" The Department earnestly recommends an\r\nappropriation of $25,000 to put it in operation again. The new Governor\r\nof Dakota seconds the recommendation, and regrets to say that, \"for the\r\nenlightenment of the 35,000 Indians embraced in the Dakota\r\nSuperintendency, there is not one school in operation.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1870 an appropriation of $5,000 was made by the Department from a\r\ngeneral educational fund, for the purpose of resuming this school. The\r\ncondition of the Poncas now is, on the whole, encouraging; they are \"not\r\nonly willing, but extremely anxious to learn the arts by which they may\r\nbecome self-supporting, and conform to the usages of white men. With the\r\ncomparatively small advantages that have been afforded them, their\r\nadvancement has been very great.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1869 they built for themselves sixteen very comfortable\r\nlog-houses; in the summer of 1870 they built forty-four more; with their\r\nannuity money they bought cookstoves, cows, and useful implements of\r\nlabor. They worked most assiduously in putting in their crops, but lost\r\nthem all by drought, and are in real danger of starvation if the\r\nGovernment does not assist them. All this while they see herds of cattle\r\ndriven across their reservation to feed the lately hostile Sioux—flour,\r\ncoffee, sugar, tobacco, by the wagon-load, distributed to them—while\r\ntheir own always peaceable, always loyal, long-suffering tribe is\r\ndigging wild roots to eat, and in actual danger of starvation.\r\nNevertheless they are not discouraged, knowing that but for the drought\r\nthey would have had ample food from their farms, and they make no\r\nattempts to retaliate on the Sioux for raiding off their horses and\r\nstock, because they hope \"that the Government will keep its faith with\r\nthem,\" and that suitable remuneration for these losses will be made\r\nthem, according to the treaty stipulations.\r\n\r\nFor the next two years they worked industriously and well; three schools\r\nwere established; a chapel was built by the Episcopal mission; the\r\nvillage began to assume the appearance of permanence and thrift; but\r\nmisfortune had not yet parted company with the Poncas. In the summer of\r\n1873 the Missouri River suddenly overflowed, washed away its banks\r\nhundreds of yards back, and entirely ruined the Ponca village. By\r\nworking night and day for two weeks the Indians saved most of the\r\nbuildings, carrying them half a mile inland to be sure of safety. The\r\nsite of their village became the bed of the main channel of the river;\r\ntheir cornfields were ruined, and the lands for miles in every direction\r\nwashed and torn up by the floods.\r\n\r\n\"For nearly two weeks,\" the agent writes, \"the work of salvage from the\r\never-threatening destruction occupied our whole available force night\r\nand day. We succeeded in carrying from the river bank to near half a\r\nmile inland the whole of the agency buildings, mechanics' houses,\r\nstabling, and sheds—more than twenty houses—nearly every panel of\r\nfencing. The Poncas worked well and long, often through the night; and\r\nthe fact that the disaster did not cost us ten dollars of actual loss is\r\nto be attributed to their labor, continuous and persevering—working\r\nsometimes over the swiftly-flowing waters, terrible and turbid, on the\r\nedge of the newly-formed current but a few inches below them, and into\r\nwhich a fall would have been certain death, even for an Indian.\"\r\n\r\nIn one year after this disaster they had recovered themselves\r\nmarvellously; built twenty new houses; owned over a hundred head of\r\ncattle and fifty wagons, and put three hundred acres of land under\r\ncultivation (about three acres to each male in the tribe). But this year\r\nwas not to close without a disaster. First came a drought; then three\r\nvisitations of locusts, one after the other, which so completely\r\nstripped the fields that \"nothing was left but a few prematurely dry\r\nstalks and straw.\" One hundred young trees which had been set\r\nout—box-elder, soft maple, and others—withered and died.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the locusts came again, destroyed the corn and oats, but left\r\nthe wheat. Much of this crop, however, was lost, as there was only one\r\nreaping-machine on the agency, and it could not do all of the work. Many\r\nof the Indians saved a part of their crop by cutting it with large\r\nbutcher-knives; but this was slow, and much of the wheat dried up and\r\nperished before it could be harvested by this tedious process.\r\n\r\nThis year was also marked by a flagrant instance of the helplessness of\r\nIndians in the courts. Two Poncas were waylaid by a party of Santees,\r\none of the Poncas murdered, and the other seriously wounded. This\r\noccurred at the Yankton Agency, where both parties were visiting. When\r\nthe case was brought up before the courts, a motion was made to quash\r\nthe indictment for want of jurisdiction, and the judge was obliged to\r\nsustain the motion, there being under the present laws no jurisdiction\r\nwhatever \"over crimes committed by one Indian on the person or property\r\nof another Indian in the Indian country.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the project of consolidating all the Indians in the United\r\nStates upon a few reservations began to be discussed and urged. If this\r\nplan were carried out, it would be the destiny of the Poncas to go to\r\nthe Indian Territory. It was very gratuitously assumed that, as they had\r\nbeen anxious to be allowed to remove to Nebraska and join the Omahas,\r\nthey would be equally ready to remove to Indian Territory—a process of\r\nreasoning whose absurdity would be very plainly seen if it were\r\nattempted to apply it in the case of white men.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of negotiations, protestations, delays, and\r\nbewilderments, the tribe at last gave what the United States Government\r\nchose to call a \"consent\" to the removal. The story of the influences,\r\ndeceits, coercions brought to bear on these unfortunate creatures before\r\nthis was brought about, is one of the most harrowing among the harrowing\r\nrecords of our dealings with the Indians. A party of chiefs were\r\ninduced, in the first place, to go, in company with a United States\r\ninspector—Kemble by name—to the Indian Territory, to see whether the\r\ncountry would suit them. It was distinctly promised to them that, if it\r\ndid not suit them, they should then be permitted to go to Washington and\r\nconsult with the President as to some further plan for their\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThe story of this journey and of its results is best told in the words\r\nof one of the Ponca chiefs, Standing Bear. No official document, no\r\nother man's narrative—no, not if a second Homer should arise to sing\r\nit—could tell the story so well as he tells it:\r\n\r\n\"We lived on our land as long as we can remember. No one knows how long\r\nago we came there. The land was owned by our tribe as far back as memory\r\nof men goes.\r\n\r\n\"We were living quietly on our farms. All of a sudden one white man\r\ncame. We had no idea what for. This was the inspector. He came to our\r\ntribe with Rev. Mr. Hinman. These two, with the agent, James Lawrence,\r\nthey made our trouble.\r\n\r\n\"They said the President told us to pack up—that we must move to the\r\nIndian Territory.\r\n\r\n\"The inspector said to us: 'The President says you must sell this land.\r\nHe will buy it and pay you the money, and give you new land in the\r\nIndian Territory.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'We do not know your authority. You have no right to\r\nmove us till we have had council with the President.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'When two persons wish to make a bargain, they can talk\r\ntogether and find out what each wants, and then make their agreement.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'We do not wish to go. When a man owns anything, he\r\ndoes not let it go till he has received payment for it.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'We will see the President first.'\r\n\r\n\"He said to us: 'I will take you to see the new land. If you like it,\r\nthen you can see the President, and tell him so. If not, then you can\r\nsee him and tell him so.' And he took all ten of our chiefs down. I\r\nwent, and Bright Eyes' uncle went. He took us to look at three different\r\npieces of land. He said we must take one of the three pieces, so the\r\nPresident said. After he took us down there he said: 'No pay for the\r\nland you left.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'You have forgotten what you said before we started.\r\nYou said we should have pay for our land. Now you say not. You told us\r\nthen you were speaking truth.' All these three men took us down there.\r\nThe man got very angry. He tried to compel us to take one of the three\r\npieces of land. He told us to be brave. He said to us: 'If you do not\r\naccept these, I will leave you here alone. You are one thousand miles\r\nfrom home. You have no money. You have no interpreter, and you cannot\r\nspeak the language.' And he went out and slammed the door. The man\r\ntalked to us from long before sundown till it was nine o'clock at night.\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'We do not like this land. We could not support\r\nourselves. The water is bad. How send us to Washington, to tell the\r\nPresident, as you promised.'\r\n\r\n\"He said to us: 'The President did not tell me to take you to\r\nWashington; neither did he tell me to take you home.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'You have the Indian money you took to bring us down\r\nhere. That money belongs to us. We would like to have some of it. People\r\ndo not give away food for nothing. We must have money to buy food on the\r\nroad.'\r\n\r\n\"He said to us: 'I will not give you a cent.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'We are in a strange country. We cannot find our way\r\nhome. Give us a pass, that people may show us our way.'\r\n\r\n\"He said: 'I will not give you any.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'This interpreter is ours. We pay him. Let him go with\r\nus.'\r\n\r\n\"He said: 'You shall not have the interpreter. He is mine, and not\r\nyours.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'Take us at least to the railroad; show us the way to\r\nthat.'\r\n\r\n\"And he would not. He left us right there. It was winter. We started for\r\nhome on foot. At night we slept in hay-stacks. We barely lived till\r\nmorning, it was so cold. We had nothing but our blankets. We took the\r\nears of corn that had dried in the fields; we ate it raw. The soles of\r\nour moccasins wore out. We were barefoot in the snow. We were nearly\r\ndead when we reached the Otoe Reserve. It had been fifty days. We stayed\r\nthere ten days to strengthen up, and the Otoes gave each of us a pony.\r\nThe agent of the Otoes told us he had received a telegram from the\r\ninspector, saying that the Indian chiefs had run away; not to give us\r\nfood or shelter, or help in any way. The agent said: 'I would like to\r\nunderstand. Tell me all that has happened. Tell me the truth.'\"\r\n\r\n(This Otoe agent afterward said that when the chiefs entered his room\r\nthey left the prints of their feet in blood on the floor as they came\r\nin.)\r\n\r\n\"Then we told our story to the agent and to the Otoe chiefs—how we had\r\nbeen left down there to find our way.\r\n\r\n\"The agent said: 'I can hardly believe it possible that any one could\r\nhave treated you so. That inspector was a poor man to have done this. If\r\nI had taken chiefs in this way, I would have brought them home; I could\r\nnot have left them there.'\r\n\r\n\"In seven days we reached the Omaha Reservation. Then we sent a telegram\r\nto the President: asked him if he had authorized this thing. We waited\r\nthree days for the answer. No answer came.\r\n\r\n\"In four days we reached our own home. We found the inspector there.\r\nWhile we were gone, he had come to our people and told them to move.\r\n\r\n\"Our people said: 'Where are our chiefs? What have you done with them?\r\nWhy have you not brought them back? We will not move till our chiefs\r\ncome back.'\r\n\r\n\"Then the inspector told them: 'To-morrow you must be ready to move. If\r\nyou are not ready you will be shot.' Then the soldiers came to the doors\r\nwith their bayonets, and ten families were frightened. The soldiers\r\nbrought wagons; they put their things in and were carried away. The rest\r\nof the tribe would not move.\r\n\r\n\"When we got there, we asked the inspector why he had done this thing,\r\nand he got very angry.\r\n\r\n\"Then we said to him: 'We did not think we would see your face again,\r\nafter what has passed. We thought never to see your face any more. But\r\nhere you are.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'This land is ours. It belongs to us. You have no right\r\nto take it from us. The land is crowded with people, and only this is\r\nleft to us.'\r\n\r\n\"We said to him: 'Let us alone. Go away from us. If you want money, take\r\nall the money which the President is to pay us for twelve years to come.\r\nYou may have it all, if you will go and leave us our lands.'\r\n\r\n\"Then, when he found that we would not go, he wrote for more soldiers to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\"Then the soldiers came, and we locked our doors, and the women and\r\nchildren hid in the woods. Then the soldiers drove all the people the\r\nother side of the river, all but my brother Big Snake and I. We did not\r\ngo; and the soldiers took us and carried us away to a fort and put us in\r\njail. There were eight officers who held council with us after we got\r\nthere. The commanding officer said: 'I have received four messages\r\ntelling me to send my soldiers after you. Now, what have you done?'\r\n\r\n\"Then we told him the whole story. Then the officer said: 'You have done\r\nno wrong. The land is yours; they had no right to take it from you. Your\r\ntitle is good. I am here to protect the weak, and I have no right to\r\ntake you; but I am a soldier, and I have to obey orders.'\r\n\r\n\"He said: 'I will telegraph to the President, and ask him what I shall\r\ndo. We do not think these three men had any authority to treat you as\r\nthey have done. When we own a piece of land, it belongs to us till we\r\nsell it and pocket the money.'\r\n\r\n\"Then he brought a telegram, and said he had received answer from the\r\nPresident. The President said he knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\n\"They kept us in jail ten days. Then they carried us back to our home.\r\nThe soldiers collected all the women and children together; then they\r\ncalled all the chiefs together in council; and then they took wagons and\r\nwent round and broke open the houses. When we came back from the council\r\nwe found the women and children surrounded by a guard of soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"They took our reapers, mowers, hay-rakes, spades, ploughs, bedsteads,\r\nstoves, cupboards, everything we had on our farms, and put them in one\r\nlarge building. Then they put into the wagons such things as they could\r\ncarry. We told them that we would rather die than leave our lands; but\r\nwe could not help ourselves. They took us down. Many died on the road.\r\nTwo of my children died. After we reached the new land, all my horses\r\ndied. The water was very bad. All our cattle died; not one was left. I\r\nstayed till one hundred and fifty-eight of my people had died. Then I\r\nran away with thirty of my people, men and women and children. Some of\r\nthe children were orphans. We were three months on the road. We were\r\nweak and sick and starved. When we reached the Omaha Reserve the Omahas\r\ngave us a piece of land, and we were in a hurry to plough it and put in\r\nwheat. While we were working the soldiers came and arrested us. Half of\r\nus were sick. We would rather have died than have been carried back; but\r\nwe could not help ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless they were helped. The news of their arrest, and the\r\nintention of the Government to take them back by force to Indian\r\nTerritory, roused excitement in Omaha. An Omaha editor and two Omaha\r\nlawyers determined to test the question whether the Government had a\r\nlegal right to do it. It seemed a bold thing, almost a hopeless thing,\r\nto undertake. It has passed into a proverb that Providence is on the\r\nside of the heaviest battalions: the oppressed and enslaved in all ages\r\nhave felt this. But there are times when a simple writ of habeas corpus\r\nis stronger than cannon or blood-hounds; and this was one of these\r\ntimes. Brought into the District Court of the United States for the\r\nDistrict of Nebraska, these Poncas were set free by the judge of that\r\ncourt. Will not the name of Judge Dundy stand side by side with that of\r\nAbraham Lincoln in the matter of Emancipation Acts?\r\n\r\nThe Government attorney, the Hon. G. M. Lambertson, made an argument\r\nfive hours long, said to have been both \"ingenious and eloquent,\" to\r\nprove that an Indian was not entitled to the protection of the writ of\r\nhabeas corpus, \"_not_ being a person or citizen under the law.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Dundy took several days to consider the case, and gave a decision\r\nwhich strikes straight to the root of the whole matter—a decision which,\r\nwhen it is enforced throughout our land, will take the ground out from\r\nunder the feet of the horde of unscrupulous thieves who have been\r\nrobbing, oppressing, and maddening the Indians for so long, that to try\r\nto unmask and expose their processes, or to make clean their methods, is\r\na task before which hundreds of good men—nay, whole denominations of\r\ngood men—disheartened, baffled, and worn-out, have given up.\r\n\r\nWhen Standing Bear found that by the decision of Judge Dundy he was\r\nreally a free man, and could go where he pleased, he made a speech which\r\nshould never be forgotten or left out in the history of the dealings of\r\nthe United States Government with the Indians.\r\n\r\nAfter a touching expression of gratitude to the lawyers who had pleaded\r\nhis cause, he said: \"Hitherto, when we have been wronged, we went to war\r\nto assert our rights and avenge our wrongs. We took the tomahawk. We had\r\nno law to punish those who did wrong, so we took our tomahawks and went\r\nto kill. If they had guns and could kill us first, it was the fate of\r\nwar. But you have found a better way. You have gone into the court for\r\nus, and I find that our wrongs can be righted there. Now I have no more\r\nuse for the tomahawk. I want to lay it down forever.\"\r\n\r\nUttering these words with eloquent impressiveness, the old chief,\r\nstooping down, placed the tomahawk on the floor at his feet; then,\r\nstanding erect, he folded his arms with native dignity, and continued:\r\n\"I lay it down. I have no more use for it. I have found a better way.\"\r\n\r\nStooping again and taking up the weapon, he placed it in Mr. Webster's\r\nhands, and said: \"I present it to you as a token of my gratitude. I want\r\nyou to keep it in remembrance of this great victory which you have\r\ngained. I have no further use for it. I can now seek the ways of peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe first use that Standing Bear made of his freedom was to endeavor to\r\nprocure the freedom of his tribe, and establish their legal right to\r\ntheir old home in Dakota. Accompanied by a young and well-educated Omaha\r\ngirl and her brother as interpreters, and by Mr. Tibbles, the champion\r\nand friend to whom he owed his freedom, he went to the Eastern States,\r\nand told the story of the sufferings and wrongs of his tribe to large\r\naudiences in many of the larger cities and towns. Money was generously\r\nsubscribed everywhere for the purpose of bringing suits to test the\r\nquestion of the Poncas' legal right to the lands which the United States\r\nGovernment had by treaty ceded to them in specified \"townships,\" thus\r\ngiving to them the same sort of title which would be given to any\r\ncorporation or individual.\r\n\r\nVery soon this movement of Standing Bear and his companions began to\r\nproduce on the community a strong effect, shown by the interest in their\r\npublic meetings, and by expressions of strong feeling in the newspapers.\r\nThis attracted the attention of the authorities at Washington. Letters\r\nwere published contradicting many of Standing Bear's assertions;\r\nstatements were circulated injurious to the reputation of all members of\r\nthe party. A careful observer of the whole course of the Department of\r\nthe Interior in this matter could not fail to come to the conclusion\r\nthat for some mysterious, unexplained, and unexplainable reason the\r\nDepartment did not wish—in fact, was unwilling—that the Ponca tribe\r\nshould be reinstated on its lands. Discussions on the matter grew warm.\r\nThe inspector who had been concerned in their removal published long\r\nletters reflecting equally on the veracity of Standing Bear and of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior. Standing Bear replied in a few pithy words,\r\nwhich were conclusive in their proving of the falsity of some of the\r\ninspector's statements. The Secretary, also, did not think it beneath\r\nhis dignity to reply in successive newspaper articles to the inspector's\r\nreflections upon him; but the only thing that was made clear by this\r\nmeans was that either the Secretary or the inspector, or both, said what\r\nwas not true.\r\n\r\nIn Boston the interest in the Ponca case reached such a height that a\r\ncommittee was appointed to represent the case in Washington, and to\r\nsecure legislation upon it. Standing Bear and his party went to\r\nWashington, and, in spite of the secret hostility of the Interior\r\nDepartment, produced a powerful impression upon Congress. Senator Dawes,\r\nof Massachusetts, and Senator Morgan, of Alabama, both became warm\r\nadvocates of their cause. The subject once started, case after case came\r\nup for investigation; and the Congressional committees called for\r\nevidence in regard to several of the more striking instances of\r\ninjustice to Indians.\r\n\r\nWhite Eagle, one of the Ponca chiefs, who had lost his wife and four\r\nchildren, and who was himself fast sinking under disease developed by\r\nthe malarial Indian Territory, came to Washington and gave eloquent\r\ntestimony in behalf of his tribe. The physicians there predicted that he\r\nhad not three months to live. A bill was introduced into Congress for\r\nrestoring to the Poncas their old reservation in Dakota, and putting\r\ntheir houses, farms, etc., in the same good condition they were at the\r\ntime of their removal.\r\n\r\nThe story of that removal was written out in full at the time by the\r\nagent who superintended it. That he should forward this report to the\r\nDepartment of the Interior was natural; but that the Department of the\r\nInterior should have been willing to publish it to the country, to have\r\nit on the official record of its management of Indian affairs for the\r\nyear 1877, is strange. It will make a fitting conclusion to this sketch\r\nof the history of the Ponca tribe. The name of this agent was E. A.\r\nHoward. He calls the report \"Journal of the March.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 21st._ Broke camp at seven o'clock and marched to Crayton, a\r\ndistance of thirteen miles. Roads very heavy. The child that died\r\nyesterday was here buried by the Indians, they preferring to bury it\r\nthan to have it buried by the white people.\r\n\r\n\"_May 22d._ Broke camp at seven o'clock and marched to Neligh, a\r\ndistance of about twenty-five miles. The day was cool, and, the road\r\nbeing high and comparatively good, the travel was made without much\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n\"_May 23d._ The morning opened with light rain; but at eight o'clock a\r\nterrific thunder-storm occurred of two hours' duration, which was\r\nfollowed by steady rain throughout the day, in consequence of which we\r\nremained in camp. During the day a child died, and several women and\r\nchildren were reported sick, and medical attendance and medicine were\r\nprocured for them.\r\n\r\n\"_May 24th._ Buried the child that died yesterday in the cemetery at\r\nNeligh, giving it a Christian burial. Broke camp at ten o'clock and\r\nmarched about eight miles, crossing the Elk-horn River about two miles\r\nbelow Oakdale Village. Were unable to cross at Neligh, the road being\r\nabout two feet under water and the bridges being washed away. The road\r\nwas fearfully bad, and much time and labor were expended in making the\r\nroad and bridges at all passable over the Elk-horn flats, where the\r\ncrossing was effected.\r\n\r\n\"_May 25th._ Broke camp at six o'clock and marched twenty miles, to a\r\npoint on Shell Creek. No wood at this place, and none to be had except\r\nwhat little had been picked up and brought in by the trains. Weather\r\ncold, damp, and dreary. The Indians during the day behaved well, and\r\nmarched splendidly.\r\n\r\n\"_May 26th._ The morning opened with a heavy continuous rain, which\r\nprevailed until ten o'clock. Broke camp at eleven o'clock and marched\r\neight miles farther down Shell Creek, when it again commenced raining,\r\nand we went into camp. The evening set in cold and rainy, and no wood to\r\nbe had except what was purchased of a settler.\r\n\r\n\"_May 27th._ The morning opened cold, with a misty rain. Rain ceased at\r\nhalf-past seven o'clock, and we broke camp at eight and marched eight\r\nmiles farther down Shell Creek, when, a heavy thunder-storm coming on,\r\nwe again went into camp. Several of the Indians were here found to be\r\nquite sick, and having no physician, and none being attainable, they\r\ngave us much anxiety and no little trouble. The daughter of Standing\r\nBear, one of the chiefs, was very low of consumption, and moving her\r\nwith any degree of comfort was almost impossible, and the same trouble\r\nexisted in transporting all the sick.\r\n\r\n\"_May 28th._ Last evening I gave orders to break camp at five o'clock\r\nthis morning, intending, if practicable, to reach Columbus before night;\r\nbut a heavy thunder-storm prevailed at that time. Broke camp at seven\r\no'clock. Marched seven miles, when we came to a slough confluent to\r\nShell Creek, which was only made passable after two hours of active work\r\nin cutting willow-brush and bringing a large quantity of wheat straw\r\nfrom a distance of thirty rods, with which we covered the road thickly.\r\nAfter crossing the slough we marched to a point on Shell Creek and\r\ncamped, having made about fourteen miles during the day.\r\n\r\n\"_May 29th._ Broke camp at seven o'clock and crossed Shell Creek. For\r\nabout five miles the road led over a divide, and was quite good; but in\r\ncoming down on the flats, which extended for five miles between the\r\nBluffs and Columbus, we found the roads for the entire distance almost\r\nimpassable, owing to the many deep, miry sloughs which cross the road,\r\nand the generally flooded and yielding condition of the soil aside from\r\nthe sloughs. Teams had to be frequently doubled, in order to get the\r\nwagons through. The difficulties were finally overcome, and the train\r\nmarched into Columbus at two o'clock, and went into camp at Soap Fork,\r\nhaving made a march of about ten miles, the march of five miles across\r\nthe flats occupying about seven hours. Major Walker, who had accompanied\r\nus from the Niobrara River to this place with twenty-five soldiers,\r\nunder orders from the War Department, took leave of us, and returned to\r\nDakota.\"\r\n\r\nIt was asserted again and again by the Secretary of the Interior, and by\r\nthe inspector, E. C. Kemble, that these Indians were not removed by\r\nforce—that they consented to go.\r\n\r\nIn another part of this same report this agent says:\r\n\r\n\"On the 15th\" (six days before the \"march\" began) \"I held another\r\ncouncil, which was largely attended by the chiefs, headmen, and soldiers\r\nof the tribe, and which was of more than four hours' duration. At this\r\ncouncil the Indians maintained that the Government had no right to move\r\nthem from the reservation, and demanded, as an inducement or equivalent\r\nfor them to give up the reservation and move to the Indian\r\nTerritory—first, the payment to them by the Government of the sum of\r\n$3,000,000; and, second, that, before starting, I should show to them\r\nthe sum of $40,000 which they had been told had been appropriated by the\r\nGovernment for their removal. To all of which I replied positively in\r\nthe negative, telling them that I would not accede to nor consider any\r\ndemands that they might make; but that I would take under my\r\nconsideration reasonable requests that they might submit touching their\r\nremoval, and, as their agent, do what I could for them in promoting\r\ntheir welfare; that I demanded that they should at all times listen to\r\nmy words; that they should go with me to their new home; and that _they\r\nshould without delay give me their final answer whether they would go\r\npeaceably or by force_. The Indians refused to give answer at this time;\r\nthe council closed without definite results; and the Indians dispersed\r\nwith a sullen look and determined expression.\"\r\n\r\nThis evidently was not the \"consent\" of which we have heard. We come to\r\nit presently.\r\n\r\n\"On the following morning, however, May 16th, they sent word to me, at\r\nan early hour, that they had considered my words, and had concluded to\r\ngo with me, and that they wanted assistance in getting the old and\r\ninfirm, together with their property, over the Niobrara River, which was\r\nmuch swollen by the rains and at a low temperature.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a night must these helpless creatures have passed before this\r\n\"consent\" was given! Seven hundred people, _more than half of them women\r\nand children_; a farming people, not armed with rifles, as the Ogallalla\r\nSioux were, when, one year later, on this same ground, the Chief Spotted\r\nTail told Commissioner Hayt that, if he did not give an order to have\r\nhis tribe on the way back to White Clay Creek in ten days, his young men\r\nwould go on the war-path at once; and the much-terrified commissioner\r\nwrote the order then and there, and the Sioux were allowed to go where\r\nthey had chosen to go. Behold the difference between the way our\r\nGovernment treats the powerful and treats the weak! What could these\r\nPonca farmers do? They must, \"without delay,\" give their \"final answer\r\nwhether they would go peaceably or _by force_.\" What did \"_by force_\"\r\nmean? It was \"_by force_\" that the Government undertook to compel the\r\nCheyennes to go to Indian Territory; and in that Cheyenne massacre the\r\nCheyenne men, women, children, and babies were all shot down together!\r\n\r\nWhat could these Ponca farmers do? What would any father, brother,\r\nhusband have done under the circumstances? He would have \"consented\" to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nThe agent, as was wise, took them at their word, quickly, and that very\r\nday, \"at five o'clock P.M., had the entire tribe, with their effects,\r\nacross the river, off the reservation, and in camp in Nebraska.\"\r\n\r\nThe agent should have said, \"with part of their effects,\" for it was\r\nonly a part, and a very small part, that this helpless _consenting_\r\nparty were allowed to take with them. All their agricultural implements\r\nand most of their furniture were left behind.\r\n\r\n\"It was a hard day's work,\" the getting the tribe and their \"effects\"\r\nacross the river, the agent says; \"the river being about forty rods\r\nwide, and the current so swift that it was found impossible to move the\r\ngoods across in any other way than by packing them on the shoulders of\r\nthe men, the quicksand bottom rendering it unsafe to trust them on the\r\nbacks of animals; even the wagons having to be drawn across by hand.\"\r\n\r\nLet us dwell for a moment on this picture. Seven hundred helpless,\r\nheart-broken people beginning their sad journey by having to ford this\r\nicy stream with quicksands at bottom. The infirm, the sick, the old, the\r\ninfants, all carried \"by packing them on the shoulders of the men!\" What\r\na scene! The Honorable Secretary of the Interior said, in one of the\r\nletters in his newspaper controversy with the inspector in regard to the\r\naccounts of this removal, that \"the highly-colored stories which are\r\ntold about the brutal military force employed in compelling their [the\r\nPoncas'] removal from Dakota to the Indian Territory are sensational\r\nfabrications; at least, the official record, which is very full, and\r\ngoes into minute details, does not in the least bear them out.\"\r\n\r\nThere was never any accusation brought against the \"military force\" of\r\n\"brutality\" in this removal. The brutality was on the part of the\r\nGovernment. The simple presence of the \"military force\" was brutal. It\r\nmeant but one thing. The Indians understood it, and the Government\r\nintended that they should understand it; and when the agent of the\r\nGovernment said to these Indians that they must give him their \"final\r\nanswer whether they would go peaceably or by force,\" he intended that\r\nthey should understand it. Has anybody any doubt what were the orders\r\nunder which that \"military force\" was there? any doubt what it would\r\nhave been the military duty of Major Walker to have done in case the\r\nPoncas had refused to \"consent\" to go?\r\n\r\nAnd now let us return to the \"Official Record,\" which is, indeed, as the\r\nHonorable Secretary of the Interior says, \"very full,\"and\" goes into\r\nminute details,\" and let us see in how much it will \"bear us out;\" and\r\nwhen we have done with this \"Official Record,\" let us ask ourselves if\r\nany imagination could have invented so \"highly-colored\" a \"story\" as it\r\ntells.\r\n\r\n\"_June 2d._ Broke camp at seven o'clock and marched seventeen miles,\r\ngoing into camp near Ulysses. Roads in bad condition.\r\n\r\n\"_June 3d._ Had some trouble in getting started. Broke camp at eleven\r\no'clock and marched eight miles. Went into camp on Blue River. Many\r\npeople sick, one of whom was reported in a dying condition. Had bad\r\nroads. Rained during afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"_June 4th._ Broke camp at six o'clock. Marched fifteen miles, and went\r\ninto camp on Lincoln Creek, near Seward.\r\n\r\n\"_June 5th._ Broke camp at seven o'clock. Marched fourteen miles, and\r\nwent into camp near Milford. Daughter of Standing Bear, Ponca chief,\r\ndied at two o'clock, of consumption.\r\n\r\n\"_June 6th._ Remained in camp all day, for the purpose of obtaining\r\nsupplies. Prairie Flower, wife of Shines White and daughter of Standing\r\nBear, who died yesterday, was here given Christian burial, her remains\r\nbeing deposited in the cemetery at Milford, Nebraska, a small village on\r\nBlue River.\r\n\r\n\"In this connection I wish to take official knowledge and recognition of\r\nthe noble action performed by the ladies of Milford, in preparing and\r\ndecorating the body of the deceased Indian woman for burial in a style\r\nbecoming the highest civilization. In this act of Christian kindness\r\nthey did more to ameliorate the grief of the husband and father than\r\nthey could have done by adopting the usual course of this untutored\r\npeople and presenting to each a dozen ponies. It was here that, looking\r\non the form of his dead daughter thus arrayed for the tomb, Standing\r\nBear was led to forget the burial-service of his tribe, and say to those\r\naround him that he was desirous of leaving off the ways of the Indian\r\nand adopting those of the white men.\r\n\r\n\"_June 7th._ Quite a heavy rain during the afternoon. The storm, most\r\ndisastrous of any that occurred during the removal of the Poncas under\r\nmy charge, came suddenly upon us while in camp on the evening of this\r\nday. It was a storm such as I never before experienced, and of which I\r\nam unable to give an adequate description. The wind blew a fearful\r\ntornado, demolishing every tent in camp, and rending many of them into\r\nshreds, overturning wagons, and hurling wagon-boxes, camp-equipages,\r\netc., through the air in every direction like straws. Some of the people\r\nwere taken up by the wind and carried as much as three hundred yards.\r\nSeveral of the Indians were quite seriously hurt, and one child died the\r\nnext day from injuries received, and was given Christian burial. The\r\nstorm caused a delay until the 8th for repairs, and for medical\r\nattendance upon the injured.\r\n\r\n\"_June 8th._ Broke camp at Milford and marched seven miles. Roads very\r\nbad. Child died during the day.\r\n\r\n\"_June 9th._ Put the child that died yesterday in the coffin and sent it\r\nback to Milford, to be buried in the same grave with its aunt, Prairie\r\nFlower. Broke camp at seven o'clock and marched to within three miles of\r\nCrete.\r\n\r\n\"_June 10th._ Broke camp at seven o'clock and marched one mile beyond De\r\nWitt, where I employed a physician to visit camp and prescribe for the\r\nsick. A woman had a thumb accidentally cut off, which caused further\r\ncommotion in the camp.\r\n\r\n\"_June 12th._ Broke camp at seven o'clock and marched to within two\r\nmiles of Otoe Agency. Crossed Wolf Creek with a part of the train, the\r\ncrossing being very difficult; but the Indians worked splendidly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Indians worked splendidly!\" Is not this a well-nigh incredible\r\nrecord of patience and long-suffering? These poor creatures, marching\r\nfrom ten to twenty-five miles a day, for twenty-two days, through muddy\r\nsloughs, swollen rivers, in tempests and floods and dreary cold, leaving\r\ntheir wives and their children dead by the way—dead of the sufferings of\r\nthe march—are yet docile, obedient, and \"work splendidly!\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 13th._ After considerable time we succeeded in building a bridge\r\nover Wolf Creek out of drift-timber, and succeeded in crossing the\r\nbalance of the train. Broke camp and marched three miles, and went into\r\ncamp again near Otoe Agency.\r\n\r\n\"_June 14th._ Water-bound, and had to remain in camp all day waiting for\r\ncreek to run down. The Otoe Indians came out to see the Poncas, and gave\r\nthem ten ponies.\r\n\r\n\"_June 15th._ Still water-bound. Remained in camp all day.\r\n\r\n\"_June 16th._ Broke camp at seven o'clock and reached Marysville,\r\nKansas, where we went into camp. During the march a wagon tipped over,\r\ninjuring a woman quite severely. Indians out of rations, and feeling\r\nhostile.\"\r\n\r\nWhat wonder that the Indians felt hostile? Hunger added to all the rest\r\nof their direful misery!\r\n\r\n\"_June 18th._ Broke camp at seven o'clock. Marched nine miles and went\r\ninto camp at Elm Creek. Little Cottonwood died. Four families determined\r\nto return to Dakota. I was obliged to ride nine miles on horseback to\r\novertake them, to restore harmony, and settle difficulty in camp. Had\r\ncoffin made for dead Indian, which was brought to camp at twelve o'clock\r\nat night from Blue Rapids. A fearful thunder-storm during the night,\r\nflooding the camp-equipage.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a \"highly-colored\" story, indeed! The darkness; the camp flooded\r\nby the driving rain; thunder and lightning; a messenger arriving at\r\nmidnight with a coffin; the four families of desperate fugitives setting\r\nout to flee back to their homes! What \"sensational fabrication\" could\r\ncompete with this?\r\n\r\n\"_June 19th._ The storm of last night left the roads in an impassable\r\ncondition, and, in consequence, was obliged to remain in camp all day.\r\nBuried Little Cottonwood in a cemetery about five miles from camp. ***\r\n\r\n\"_June 25th._ Broke camp at six o'clock. Marched to a point about\r\nfifteen miles farther up Deep Creek. Two old women died during the day.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\"_June 30th._ Broke camp at six o'clock. Passed through Hartford, and\r\ncamped about six miles above Burlington. A child of Buffalo Chief died\r\nduring the day. ***\r\n\r\n\"_July 2d._ Broke camp at six o'clock. Made a long march of fifteen\r\nmiles for Noon Camp, for reason that no water could be got nearer. An\r\nIndian became hostile, and made a desperate attempt to kill White Eagle,\r\nhead chief of the tribe. For a time every male in camp was on the\r\nwar-path, and for about two hours the most intense excitement prevailed,\r\nheightened by continued loud crying by all the women and children.\"\r\n\r\nThis Indian, who is reported here as having \"become hostile,\" no doubt,\r\ntried to kill White Eagle for having allowed the tribe to be brought\r\ninto all this trouble. It is the general feeling among the less\r\nintelligent members of a tribe that their chiefs are bound, under all\r\ncircumstances, to see that they come to no harm.\r\n\r\n\"_July 9th._ Broke camp at six o'clock, passing through Baxter Springs\r\nat about one o'clock. Just after passing Baxter Springs a terrible\r\nthunder-storm struck us. The wind blew a heavy gale and the rain fell in\r\ntorrents, so that it was impossible to see more than four or five rods\r\ndistant, thoroughly drenching every person and every article in the\r\ntrain, making a fitting end to a journey commenced by wading a river and\r\nthereafter encountering innumerable storms.\r\n\r\n\"During the last few days of the journey the weather was exceedingly\r\nhot, and the teams terribly annoyed and bitten by green-head flies,\r\nwhich attacked them in great numbers. Many of the teams were nearly\r\nexhausted, and, had the distance been but little farther, they must have\r\ngiven out. The people were all nearly worn out from the fatigue of the\r\nmarch, and were heartily glad that the long, tedious journey was at an\r\nend, that they might take that rest so much required for the\r\nrecuperation of their physical natures.\" Now let us see what provision\r\nthe Government had made for that \"rest\" and \"recuperation,\" surely \"much\r\nrequired\" and fairly earned. Not one dollar had been appropriated for\r\nestablishing them in their new home; not one building had been put up.\r\nThis people was set down in a wilderness without one provision of any\r\nkind for their shelter.\r\n\r\n\"It is a matter of astonishment to me,\" says Agent Howard (p. 100 of\r\nthis \"Report\"), \"that the Government should have ordered the removal of\r\nthe Ponca Indians from Dakota to the Indian Territory without having\r\nfirst made some provision for their settlement and comfort. Before their\r\nremoval was carried into effect an appropriation should have been made\r\nby Congress sufficient to have located them in their new home, by\r\nbuilding a comfortable home for the occupancy of every family of the\r\ntribe. As the case now is, no appropriation has been made by Congress\r\nexcept of a sum little more than sufficient to remove them; and the\r\nresult is that these people have been placed on an uncultivated\r\nreservation, to live in their tents as best they may, and await further\r\nlegislative action.\"\r\n\r\nThis journal of Mr. Howard's is the best record that can ever be written\r\nof the sufferings of the Poncas in their removal from their homes. It is\r\n\"highly colored;\" but no one, however much it may be for his interest to\r\ndo so, can call it \"a sensational fabrication,\" or can discredit it in\r\nthe smallest particular, for it is an \"official record,\" authorized and\r\nendorsed by being published in the \"Annual Report\" of the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the Ponca tribe is still in Indian Territory, awaiting\r\nanxiously the result of the efforts to restore to them their old homes,\r\nand to establish the fact of their indisputable legal right to them.[27]\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Art. II., for later facts in the history of the Poncas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                            THE WINNEBAGOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Winnebagoes belonged to the Dakota family, but, so far as can be\r\nknown, were naturally a peace-loving people, and had no sympathy with\r\nthe more warlike tribes of their race. The Algonquins gave them the name\r\nof Winnebagoes, or \"people of the salt-water;\" and as the Algonquin word\r\nfor salt-water and stinking-water was the same, the French called them\r\n\"Les Puants,\" or \"Stinkards.\" The Sioux gave them a more melodious and\r\npleasing name, \"O-ton-kah,\" which signified \"The large, strong people.\"\r\n\r\nBancroft, in his account of the North American tribes, says: \"One little\r\ncommunity of the Dakota (Sioux) family had penetrated the territories of\r\nthe Algonquins: the Winnebagoes dwelling between Green Bay and the lake\r\nthat bears their name preferred to be environed by Algonquins than to\r\nstay in the dangerous vicinity of their own kindred.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest mentions that is found of this tribe, in the\r\ndiplomatic history of our country, is in the reports given of a council\r\nheld in July, 1815, at \"Portage des Sioux,\" in Missouri, after the\r\ntreaty of Ghent. To this council the Winnebagoes refused to send\r\ndelegates; and their refusal was evidently considered a matter of some\r\nmoment. The commissioners \"appointed to treat with the North-western\r\nIndians\" at this time reported that they found \"the Indians much divided\r\namong themselves in regard to peace with the United States.\" Some of\r\nthem \"spoke without disguise of their opposition to military\r\nestablishments on the Mississippi,\" and many of them, \"among whom were\r\nthe Winnebagoes, utterly refused to send deputies to the council.\" This\r\ndisaffection was thought by the commissioners to be largely due to the\r\ninfluence of British traders, who plied the Indians with gifts, and\r\nassured them that war would soon break out again between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain. It is probable, however, that the Winnebagoes\r\nheld themselves aloof from these negotiations more from a general\r\ndistrust of white men than from any partisan or selfish leaning to the\r\nside of Great Britain; for when Dr. Jedediah Morse visited them, only\r\nseven years later, he wrote: \"There is no other tribe which seems to\r\npossess so much jealousy of the whites, and such reluctance to have\r\nintercourse with them, as this.\"\r\n\r\nSpite of this reluctance they made, in 1816, a treaty \"of peace and\r\nfriendship with the United States,\" agreeing \"to remain distinct and\r\nseparate from the rest of their nation or tribe, giving them no\r\nassistance whatever until peace shall be concluded between the United\r\nStates and their tribe or nation.\" They agreed also to confirm and\r\nobserve all the lines of British, French, or Spanish cessions of land to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 the United States Government, unable to endure the spectacle of\r\nIndians warring among themselves, and massacring each other, appears in\r\nthe North-western country as an unselfish pacificator, and compels the\r\nSacs, Foxes, Chippewas, and Sioux, including the Winnebagoes, to make a\r\ntreaty of peace and friendship with each other and with the United\r\nStates. The negotiations for this treaty occupied one month; which does\r\nnot seem a long time when one considers that the boundaries of all the\r\nlands to be occupied by these respective tribes were to be defined, and\r\nthat in those days and regions definitions of distance were stated in\r\nsuch phrases as \"a half day's march,\" \"a long day's march,\" \"about a\r\nday's paddle in a canoe,\" \"to a point where the woods come out into the\r\nmeadows,\" \"to a point on Buffalo River, half way between its source and\r\nits mouth.\" These were surely precarious terms for peace to rest upon,\r\nespecially as it was understood by all parties that \"no tribe shall hunt\r\nwithin the actual limits of any other without their consent.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of this treaty there occurred a curious incident, which\r\nSchoolcraft calls \"an experiment on the moral sense of the Indians with\r\nregard to intoxicating liquors.\" \"It had been said by the tribes that\r\nthe true reason for the Commissioners of the United States speaking\r\nagainst the use of ardent spirits by the Indians, and refusing to give\r\nit to them, was the fear of expense, and not a sense of its bad effects.\r\nTo show them that the Government was above such a petty motive, the\r\ncommissioners had a long row of tin camp-kettles, holding several\r\ngallons each, placed on the grass; and then, after some suitable\r\nremarks, each kettle was spilled out in their presence. The thing was\r\nill-relished by the Indians, who loved the whiskey better than the\r\njoke.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time the lands of the Winnebagoes lay between the Rock and the\r\nWisconsin rivers, along the shore of Winnebago Lake, and the Indians\r\nclaimed that the whole lake belonged to them. It was here that President\r\nMorse had found them living in 1822. He gives the following graphic\r\npicture of their pleasant home: \"They have five villages on the Lake,\r\nand fourteen on Rock River. The country has abundance of springs, small\r\nlakes, ponds, and rivers; a rich soil, producing corn and all sorts of\r\ngrain. The lakes abound with fine-flavored, firm fish.\" Of the Indians\r\nthemselves, he says: \"They are industrious, frugal, and temperate. They\r\ncultivate corn, potatoes, pumpkins, squashes, and beans, and are\r\nremarkably provident. They numbered five hundred and eighty souls.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1827 a third treaty was signed by the Winnebagoes, Chippewas, and\r\nMenomonies with the United States and with each other. This treaty\r\ncompleted the system of boundaries of their lands, which had been only\r\npartially defined by the two previous treaties. Of these three treaties\r\nSchoolcraft says: \"These three conferences embody a new course and\r\npolicy for keeping the tribes in peace, and are founded on the most\r\nenlarged consideration of the aboriginal right of fee-simple to the\r\nsoil. They have been held exclusively at the charge and expense of the\r\nUnited States, and contain no cession of territory.\"\r\n\r\nThey were the last treaties of their kind. In 1828 the people of\r\nNorthern Illinois were beginning to covet and trespass on some of the\r\nIndian lands, and commissioners were sent to treat with the Indians for\r\nthe surrender of such lands. The Indians demurred, and the treaty was\r\ndeferred; the United States in the mean time agreeing to pay to the four\r\ntribes $20,000, \"in full compensation for all the injuries and damages\r\nsustained by them in consequence of the occupation of any part of the\r\nmining country.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1829 a benevolent scheme for the rescue of these hard-pressed tribes\r\nof the North-western territory was proposed by Mr. J. D. Stevens, a\r\nmissionary at Mackinaw. He suggested the formation of a colony of them\r\nin the Lake Superior region. He says—and his words are as true to-day,\r\nin 1879, as they were fifty years ago: \"The Indian is in every view\r\nentitled to sympathy. The misfortune of the race is that, seated on the\r\nskirts of the domain of a popular government, they have no vote to give.\r\nThey are politically a nonentity. *** The whole Indian race is not worth\r\none white man's vote. If the Indian were raised to the right of giving\r\nhis suffrage, a plenty of politicians on the frontiers would enter into\r\nplans to better him; whereas now the subject drags along like an incubus\r\nin Congress.\"\r\n\r\nIt did, indeed. Appropriations were sadly behindhand. The promises made\r\nto the Indians could not be fulfilled, simply because there was no money\r\nto fulfil them with. In 1829 a Washington correspondent writes to Mr.\r\nSchoolcraft: \"There is a screw loose in the public machinery somewhere.\r\nIn 1827 we were promised $48,000 for the Indian service, and got\r\n$30,000; in 1828 $40,000, and got $25,000.\" A little later the Secretary\r\nof War himself writes: \"Our annual appropriation has not yet passed; and\r\nwhen it will, I am sure I cannot tell.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the all-engrossing topic of Congress is said to be \"the removal\r\nof the Indians. It occupies the public mind throughout the Union, and\r\npetitions and remonstrances are pouring in without number.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the Indians were warring among themselves, and also retaliating\r\non the white settlers who encroached upon their lands. The inevitable\r\nconflict had begun in earnest, and in September of 1832 the Winnebagoes\r\nwere compelled to make their first great cession of territory to the\r\nUnited States. In exchange for it they accepted a tract west of the\r\nMississippi, and before the 1st of June, 1833, most of those who were\r\nliving on the ceded lands had crossed the river to their new homes.\r\nTheir title to this new country was not so good as they probably\r\nsupposed, for the treaty expressly stated that it was granted to them\r\n\"to be held as other Indian lands are held.\"\r\n\r\nArticle three of this treaty said, \"As the country hereby ceded by the\r\nWinnebagoes is more extensive and valuable than that given by the United\r\nStates in exchange,\" the United States would pay to the Winnebagoes\r\n$10,000 annually in specie for twenty-seven years. The Government also\r\npromised to put up buildings for them, send teachers, make various\r\nallowances for stock, implements, tobacco, etc., and to furnish them\r\nwith a doctor.\r\n\r\nThe Winnebagoes agreed to deliver up some of their number who had\r\nmurdered white settlers. Lands were granted by patent to four\r\nWinnebagoes by name—two men and two women; for what reason, does not\r\nappear in the treaty.\r\n\r\nFive years later the Winnebagoes ceded to the United States all their\r\nlands east of the Mississippi, and also relinquished the right to\r\noccupy, \"except for hunting,\" a portion of that which they owned on the\r\nwest side. For this cession and relinquishment they were to receive\r\n$200,000; part of this sum to be expended in paying their debts, the\r\nexpense of their removal and establishment in their new homes, and the\r\nrest to be invested by the United States Government for their benefit.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 the Winnebagoes were forced to make another treaty, by which\r\nthey finally ceded and sold to the United States \"all right, title,\r\ninterest, claim, and privilege to all lands heretofore occupied by\r\nthem;\" and accepted as their home, \"to be held as other Indian lands are\r\nheld,\" a tract of 800,000 acres north of St. Peter's, and west of the\r\nMississippi. For this third removal they were to be paid\r\n$190,000—$150,000 for the lands they gave up, and $40,000 for\r\nrelinquishing the hunting privilege on lands adjacent to their own. Part\r\nof this was to be expended in removing them, and the balance was to be\r\n\"left in trust\" with the Government at five per cent. interest.\r\n\r\nThis reservation proved unsuited to them. The tribe were restless and\r\ndiscontented; large numbers of them were continually roaming back to\r\ntheir old homes in Iowa and Wisconsin, and in 1855 they gladly made\r\nanother treaty with the Government, by which they ceded back to the\r\nUnited States all the land which the treaty of 1846 had given them, and\r\ntook in exchange for it a tract eighteen miles square on the Blue Earth\r\nRiver. The improved lands on which they had been living, their mills and\r\nother buildings, were to be appraised and sold to the highest bidder,\r\nand the amount expended in removing them, subsisting them, and making\r\nthem comfortable in their new home. This reservation, the treaty said,\r\nshould be their \"permanent home;\" and as this phrase had never before\r\nbeen used in any of their treaties, it is to be presumed that the\r\nWinnebagoes took heart at hearing it. They are said to have \"settled\r\ndown quietly and contentedly,\" and have gone to work immediately,\r\n\"ploughing, planting, and building.\"\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Minnesota did not take kindly to their new neighbors.\r\n\"An indignation meeting was held; a petition to the President signed;\r\nand movements made, the object of all which was to oust these Indians\r\nfrom their dearly-purchased homes,\" says the Report of the Indian\r\nCommissioner for 1855.\r\n\r\nSuch movements, and such a public sentiment on the part of the\r\npopulation surrounding them, certainly did not tend to encourage the\r\nWinnebagoes to industry, or to give them any very sanguine hopes of\r\nbeing long permitted to remain in their \"permanent home.\" Nevertheless\r\nthey worked on, doing better and better every year, keeping good faith\r\nwith the whites and with the Government, and trusting in the\r\nGovernment's purpose and power to keep faith with them. The only serious\r\nfaults with which they could be charged were drunkenness and gambling,\r\nand both of these they had learned of the white settlers. In the latter\r\nthey had proved to be apt scholars, often beating professional gamblers\r\nat their own game.\r\n\r\nThey showed the bad effects of their repeated removals, also, in being\r\ndisposed to wander back to their old homes. Sometimes several hundred of\r\nthem would be roaming about in Wisconsin. But the tribe, as a whole,\r\nwere industrious, quiet, always peaceable and loyal, and steadily\r\nimproving. They took hold in earnest of the hard work of farming; some\r\nof them who could not get either horses or ploughs actually breaking up\r\nnew land with hoes, and getting fair crops out of it. Very soon they\r\nbegan to entreat to have their farms settled on them individually, and\r\nguaranteed to them for their own; and the Government, taking advantage\r\nof this desire on their part, made a treaty with them in 1859, by which\r\npart of their lands were to be \"allotted\" to individuals in \"severalty,\"\r\nas they had requested, and the rest were to be sold, the proceeds to be\r\npartly expended in improvements on their farms, and partly to be \"left\r\nin trust\" with the Government. This measure threw open hundreds of\r\nthousands of acres of land to white settlers, and drew the belt of\r\ngreedy civilization much tighter around the Indians. Similar treaties to\r\nthis had been already made with some of the Sioux tribes and with\r\nothers. It was evident that \"the surplus land occupied by the Indians\r\nwas required for the use of the increasing white population,\" and that\r\nit was \"necessary to reduce the reservations.\"\r\n\r\nThere is in this treaty of 1859 one extraordinary provision: \"In order\r\nto render unnecessary any further treaty engagements or arrangements\r\nwith the United States, it is hereby agreed and stipulated that the\r\nPresident, with the assent of Congress, shall have full power to modify\r\nor change any of the provisions of former treaties with the Winnebagoes,\r\nin such manner and to whatever extent he may judge to be necessary and\r\nexpedient for their welfare and best interest.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to avoid having a doubt whether the chiefs and headmen\r\nof the Winnebago tribe who signed this treaty ever heard that proviso.\r\nIt is incredible that they could have been so simple and trustful as to\r\nhave assented to it.\r\n\r\nProspects now brightened for the Winnebagoes. With their farms given to\r\nthem for their own, and a sufficient sum of money realized by the sale\r\nof surplus lands to enable them to thoroughly improve the remainder,\r\ntheir way seemed open to prosperity and comfort. They \"entered upon\r\nfarming with a zeal and energy which gave promise of a prosperous and\r\ncreditable future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every family in the tribe has more or less ground under cultivation,\"\r\nsays their agent. He reports, also, the minutes of a council held by the\r\nchiefs, which tell their own story:\r\n\r\n\"When we were at Washington last winter, we asked our Great Father to\r\ntake $300,000 out of the $1,100,000, so that we could commence our next\r\nspring's work. We do not want all of the $1,100,000, only sufficient to\r\ncarry on our improvements. This money we ask for we request only as a\r\nloan; and when our treaty is ratified, we want it replaced. We want to\r\nbuy cattle, horses, ploughs, and wagons; and this money can be replaced\r\nwhen our lands are sold. We hope you will get this money: we want good\r\nfarms and good houses. Many have already put on white man's clothes, and\r\nmore of us will when our treaty is ratified.\r\n\r\n\"Father, we do not want to make you tired of talk, but hope you will\r\nmake a strong paper, and urgent request of our Great Father in respect\r\nto our wishes.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs writes: \"The Winnebagoes\r\ncontinue steadily on the march of improvement. *** The progress of the\r\nWinnebagoes in agricultural growths is particularly marked with success.\r\nThere have been raised by individuals as high as sixty acres of wheat on\r\na single farm. *** The agent's efforts have been directed to giving to\r\neach Indian his own allotment of land. *** Wigwams are becoming as\r\nscarce as houses were two years ago. *** All Indians who had horses\r\nploughed and farmed their own lands. *** The Indians were promised that\r\nnew and comfortable houses should be built for them. The treaty not yet\r\nbeing ratified, I have no funds in my hands that could be made\r\napplicable to this purpose. *** The greater part of the Indians have\r\nentreated me to carry out the meaning of the commissioner on his visit\r\nhere, and the reasons for my not doing so do not seem comprehensible to\r\nthem. *** The school is in a flourishing condition.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the commissioner writes that the allotment of lands in severalty\r\nto the Winnebagoes has been \"substantially accomplished;\" but that the\r\nsales of the remaining lands have not yet been made, owing to the\r\nunsettled condition of the country, and therefore the funds on which the\r\nIndians were depending for the improvements of their farms have not been\r\npaid to them. They complain bitterly that the provisions of the treaty\r\nof 1859 have not been fulfilled. \"It has been two years and a half since\r\nthis treaty was concluded,\" says the agent, \"and the Indians have been\r\ntold from one season to another that something would be done under it\r\nfor their benefit, and as often disappointed, till the best of them\r\nbegin to doubt whether anything will be done. *** The Indians who have\r\nhad their allotments made are 'clamoring for their certificates.'\"\r\n\r\nDrunkenness is becoming one of the serious vices of the tribe. They are\r\nsurrounded on all sides by white men who traffic in whiskey, and who\r\nare, moreover, anxious to reduce the Indians to as degraded a state as\r\npossible. \"There are some circumstances connected with the location of\r\nthis tribe which make it more difficult to protect them from the ravages\r\nof liquor-selling than any other tribe. They are closely surrounded by a\r\nnumerous white population, and these people feel very indignant because\r\nthe Indians are settled in their midst, and are disposed to make it as\r\nuncomfortable for them to remain here as they can, hoping at some future\r\ntime they may be able to cause their removal.\"\r\n\r\nThe time was not far distant. In 1862 we find the Winnebagoes in trouble\r\nindeed. A ferocious massacre of white settlers by the Sioux had so\r\nexasperated the citizens of Minnesota, that they demanded the removal of\r\nall Indians from the State. The people were so excited that not an\r\nIndian could step outside the limits of the reservation without the risk\r\nof being shot at sight. The Winnebagoes had utterly refused to join the\r\nSioux in their attack on the whites, and had been threatened by them\r\nwith extermination in consequence of this loyalty. Thus they were\r\nequally in danger from both whites and Indians: their position was truly\r\npitiable.\r\n\r\nIn the Annual Report of the Interior Department for 1862 the condition\r\nof things is thus described: \"While it may be true that a few of the\r\nWinnebagoes were engaged in the atrocities of the Sioux, the tribe, as\r\nsuch, is no more justly responsible for their acts than our Government\r\nwould be for a pirate who happened to have been born on our territory.\r\nNotwithstanding this, the exasperation of the people of Minnesota\r\nappears to be nearly as great toward the Winnebagoes as toward the\r\nSioux. They demand that the Winnebagoes as well as the Sioux shall be\r\nremoved from the limits of the State. The Winnebagoes are unwilling to\r\nmove. Yet the Minnesota people are so excited that not a Winnebago can\r\nleave his reservation without risk of being shot; and as they have never\r\nreceived their promised implements of agriculture, and the game on their\r\nreservation is exhausted, and their arms have been taken from them, they\r\nare starving.\"\r\n\r\nTheir agent writes: \"These Indians have been remaining here in a\r\ncontinuous state of suspense, waiting for the Government to cause the\r\nstipulations of the treaty of 1859 to be carried into operation: such\r\nhas been their condition for three years and a half, and they do not\r\nunderstand why it is so. *** The fact that a very few of the Winnebagoes\r\nwere present and witnessed, if they did not take part in, the massacre\r\nat the Lower Sioux Agency, has caused the Winnebagoes themselves to be\r\nuniversally suspected of disloyalty. *** The hostile feelings of the\r\nwhite people are so intense, that I am necessitated to use extra efforts\r\nto keep the Indians upon their own lands. I have been notified by the\r\nwhites that the Indians will be massacred if they go out of their own\r\ncountry; and it is but a few days since an Indian was killed while\r\ncrossing the Mississippi River, for no other reason than that he was an\r\nIndian, and such is the state of public opinion that the murderer goes\r\nunpunished.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the loyalty of the tribe, the agent says: \"There is no tribe of\r\nIndians more so.\" There is \"no doubt of their loyalty as a tribe. *** In\r\nconsequence of a threat made by the Sioux, immediately upon their\r\noutbreak, that they (the Sioux) would exterminate the Winnebagoes unless\r\nthey joined them in a raid against the white people, the Winnebagoes\r\nhave lived in fear of an attack from the Sioux, and have almost daily\r\nimplored me for protection. *** To further assure them, I requested of\r\nthe Governor of the State that two companies of United States infantry\r\nbe stationed here in their midst, which has allayed their fears. ***\r\nNotwithstanding the nearness of the belligerent Sioux, and the\r\nunfriendly feelings of the white people, and other unfortunate\r\ncircumstances, I am confident that my Indians will remain loyal to the\r\nlast. *** They have been informed that, notwithstanding their fidelity\r\nto the Government and the people, the people of this State are\r\nmemorializing Congress to remove them out of the State—which they\r\nconsider very unjust under the circumstances, for they have become\r\nattached to this location and would not leave it willingly, and think\r\ntheir fidelity ought to entitle them to respect and kind treatment.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"popular demand\" of the people of Minnesota triumphed. In February,\r\n1863, Congress passed an act authorizing the \"peaceful and quiet removal\r\nof the Winnebago Indians from the State of Minnesota, and the settling\r\nof them on a new reserve.\" It was determined to locate them \"on the\r\nMissouri River somewhere within a hundred miles of Fort Randall, where\r\nit is not doubted they will be secure from any danger of intrusion from\r\nwhites.\" All their guns, rifles, and pistols were to be taken from them,\r\n\"securely boxed up,\" labelled \"with the names of their respective\r\nowners.\" The Department impressed it on the agent in charge of the\r\nremoval that it was \"absolutely necessary that no time should be lost in\r\nthe emigrating of these Indians.\" The hostile Sioux were to be removed\r\nat the same time, and to a reservation adjoining the reservation of the\r\nWinnebagoes. The reports of the Indian Bureau for 1863 tell the story of\r\nthis removal.[28]\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Art. VI.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner says: \"The case of the Winnebagoes is one of peculiar\r\nhardship. I am still of the opinion that this tribe was in no manner\r\nimplicated in or responsible for the cruel and wanton outbreak on the\r\npart of the Sioux; but its consequences to the tribe have been as\r\ndisastrous as unmerited. In obedience to the Act of Congress, and the\r\npopular demand of the people of Minnesota, they have been removed to a\r\nnew location upon the Missouri River, adjoining that selected for the\r\nSioux. Contrasting the happy homes, and the abundant supply for all\r\ntheir wants which they have left behind them, with the extreme\r\ndesolation which prevails throughout the country, including their\r\npresent location, and their almost defenceless state, as against the\r\nhostile savages in their vicinity, their present condition is truly\r\npitiable; and it is not surprising that they have become to some extent\r\ndiscouraged, and are dissatisfied with their new homes. It cannot be\r\ndisguised that their removal, although nominally peaceable and with\r\ntheir consent, was the result of the overwhelming pressure of the public\r\nsentiment of the community in which they resided; and it is to be feared\r\nthat it will be many years before their confidence in the good faith of\r\nour Government, in its professed desire to ameliorate and improve their\r\ncondition, will be restored. Their misfortunes and good conduct deserve\r\nour sympathy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Act of Congress above mentioned provides for the peaceable removal\r\nof the Indians. In its execution some of the members of the tribe were\r\nfound unwilling to leave their homes; and as there was neither the\r\ndisposition nor the power to compel them to accompany their brethren,\r\nthey remained upon their old reservation. The most of them are\r\nrepresented as having entirely abandoned the Indian habits and customs,\r\nand as being fully qualified by good conduct and otherwise for civilized\r\nlife. Many of them are enlisted in the military service, and all are\r\ndesirous of retaining possession of the homes allotted to them under the\r\nprovisions of their treaty.\r\n\r\n\"The trust lands belonging to the tribe have been placed in the market,\r\nand from the amount already sold has been realized $82,537.62. An\r\nappraisement has also been had of the lands of the diminished reserve,\r\nand the same will soon be placed in the market.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Report of the Superintendent of the North-west Territory for the\r\nsame year is the following summing up of their case: \"The case of these\r\nWinnebago Indians is one of peculiar hardship. Hurried from their\r\ncomfortable homes in Minnesota, in 1863, almost without previous notice,\r\nhuddled together on steamboats with poor accommodations, and transported\r\nto the Crow Creek Agency in Dakota Territory at an expense to themselves\r\nof more than $50,000, they were left, after a very imperfect and hasty\r\npreparation of their new agency for their reception, upon a sandy beach\r\non the west bank of the Missouri River, in a country remarkable only for\r\nthe rigors of its winter climate and the sterility of its soil, to\r\nsubsist themselves where the most industrious and frugal white man would\r\nfail, five years out of six, to raise enough grain upon which to subsist\r\na family. The stern alternative was presented to this unfortunate\r\npeople, thus deprived of comfortable homes (on account of no crime or\r\nmisdemeanor of their own), of abandoning this agency, or encountering\r\ndeath from cold or starvation. They wisely chose the former; and after\r\nencountering hardships and sufferings too terrible to relate, and the\r\nloss of several hundred of their tribe by starvation and freezing, they\r\narrived at their present place of residence [the Omaha Agency] in a\r\ncondition which excited the active sympathy of all who became acquainted\r\nwith the story of their wrongs. There they have remained, trusting that\r\nthe Government would redeem its solemn promise to place them in a\r\nposition west of the Missouri which should be as comfortable as the one\r\nwhich they occupied in Minnesota.\r\n\r\n\"This tribe is characterized by frugality, thrift, and industry to an\r\nextent unequalled by any other tribe of Indians in the North-west. Loyal\r\nto the Government, and peaceable toward their neighbors, they are\r\nentitled to the fostering care of the General Government. The\r\nimprovement of the homes which they have voluntarily selected for their\r\nfuture residence will place them in a short time beyond the reach of\r\nwant, and take from the Government the burden of supplying their wants\r\nat an actual expense of $100,000.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in May, 1863, that the Winnebagoes gathered at Fort Snelling,\r\nready for their journey. The chiefs are said to have \"acquiesced in the\r\nmove as a matter of necessity, for the protection of their people,\" but\r\nsome of them \"actually shed tears on taking leave.\" Colonel Mix, who was\r\nin charge of this removal, wrote to Washington, urgently entreating that\r\ntents at least might be provided for them on their arrival at their new\r\nhomes in the wilderness. He also suggests that it is a question whether\r\nthey ought to be settled so near the hostile Sioux, especially as just\r\nbefore leaving Minnesota some of the tribe had \"scalped three Sioux\r\nIndians, thinking it would propitiate them in the kind regards of their\r\nGreat Father at Washington, and, as a consequence, they would perhaps be\r\npermitted to remain in Minnesota.\"\r\n\r\nThe removal was accomplished in May and June. There were, all told, 1945\r\nof the Winnebagoes. They arrived to find themselves in an almost barren\r\nwilderness—a dry, hard soil, \"too strong for ploughs;\" so much so, that\r\nit was \"difficult to get a plough to run a whole day without breaking.\"\r\nA drought had parched the grass, so that in many places where the\r\nprevious year several tons of good hay to an acre had been raised there\r\nwas not now \"pasturage for a horse.\" The cottonwood timber, all which\r\ncould be procured, was \"crooked, difficult to handle, full of\r\nwind-shakes, rots, etc.\" The channel of the Missouri River here was so\r\n\"changeable,\" and the banks so low, that it was \"dangerous to get too\r\nnear.\" They were obliged therefore to settle half a mile away from the\r\nriver. No wonder that on July 1st the Winnebagoes are reported as \"not\r\npleased with their location, and anxious to return to Minnesota, or to\r\nsome other place among the whites.\" They gathered together in council,\r\nand requested Superintendent Thompson to write to their Great Father for\r\npermission \"to move among the whites again. *** They have lived so long\r\namong the whites that they are more afraid of wild Indians than the\r\nwhites are.\" The superintendent hopes, however, they will be more\r\ncontented as soon as he can get them comfortable buildings. But on July\r\n16th we find Brigadier-general Sulley, commander of the North-western\r\nexpedition against Indians, writing to the Department in behalf of these\r\nunfortunate creatures. General Sulley having been detained in camp near\r\nCrow Creek on account of the low water, the chiefs had gone to him with\r\ntheir tale of misery. \"They stated that nothing would grow here. They\r\ndare not go out to hunt for fear of other tribes, and they would all\r\nstarve to death. This I believe to be true, without the Government\r\nintends to ration them all the time. The land is sandy, dry, and parched\r\nup. *** The land is poor; a low, sandy soil. I don't think you can\r\ndepend on a crop of corn even once in five years, as it seldom rains\r\nhere in the summer. *** I find them hard at work making canoes, with the\r\nintention of quitting the agency and going to join the Omahas or some\r\nother tribe down the river. They said they had been promised to be\r\nsettled on the Big Sioux River. *** I told them they must stay here till\r\nthey get permission from Washington to move; that, if they attempted it,\r\nthey would be fired on by my troops stationed down the river.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a graphic picture of the condition of a band of two thousand\r\nhuman beings, for whose \"benefit\" $82,537.62 had just been realized from\r\nsale of their lands by the Government, to say nothing of the property\r\nthey owned in lands yet unsold, and in annuity provisions of previous\r\ntreaties to the amount of over $1,000,000 capital! Is not their long\r\nsuffering, their patience, well-nigh incredible?\r\n\r\nSpite of the dread of being fired on by the United States troops, they\r\ncontinued to make canoes and escape in them from this \"new home\" in the\r\ndesert, and in October the Department of the Interior began to receive\r\nletters containing paragraphs like this: \"I have also to report that\r\nsmall detachments of Winnebagoes are constantly arriving in canoes,\r\nlocating on our reserve, and begging for food to keep them from\r\nstarving.\"—_Agent for Omaha Agency._\r\n\r\nThese are the men who only one year before had been living in\r\ncomfortable homes, with several hundred acres of good ground under\r\ncultivation, and \"clamoring for certificates\" of their \"allotted\"\r\nfarms—now shelterless, worse than homeless, escaping by canoe-loads,\r\nunder fire of United States soldiers, from a barren desert, and\r\n\"clamoring\" for food at Indian agencies!\r\n\r\nThe Department of the Interior promptly reports to the Superintendent of\r\nIndian Affairs in Minnesota this \"information,\" and calls it\r\n\"astounding.\" The Department had \"presumed that Agent Balcombe would\r\nadopt such measures as would induce the Winnebagoes to remain upon their\r\nreservation,\" and had \"understood that ample arrangements had been made\r\nfor their subsistence.\" It, however, ordered the Omaha agent to feed the\r\nstarving refugees till spring, and it sent word to those still remaining\r\non the reservation that they must not \"undertake to remove without the\r\nconsent of their Great Father, as it is his determination that a home\r\nthat shall be healthy, pleasant, and fertile, shall be furnished to them\r\nat the earliest practicable moment.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in the autumn of 1863. In one year no less than 1222 of the\r\ndestitute Winnebagoes had escaped and made their way to the Omaha\r\nReservation in Nebraska. Here the Superintendent of the Northern\r\nSuperintendency held a council with them.\r\n\r\n\"They expressed,\" he says, \"a strong desire to have some arrangement\r\nmade by which they would be allowed to occupy a portion of that\r\nreservation. It was represented that the Omahas wished it also. *** I\r\nfound that I could not gain their consent to go back to their\r\nreservation, and I had no means within my reach of forcing them back,\r\neven if I had deemed it proper to do so.\" The superintendent\r\nrecommended, therefore, that they be subsisted where they were \"until\r\nsome arrangement be made for their satisfaction, or some concert of\r\naction agreed upon between the War Department and the Interior\r\nDepartment by which they can be kept on their reservation after they\r\nshall have been moved there.\"\r\n\r\nIn September of this same year the agent for the Winnebago Reserve wrote\r\nthat the absence of a protecting force had been one of the reasons of\r\nthe Indians leaving in such numbers. \"Both the Winnebagoes and Sioux who\r\nhave stayed here have lived in fear and trembling close to the stockade,\r\nand have refused to separate and live upon separate tracts of land.\"\r\n\r\nHe gives some further details as to the soil and climate. \"The region\r\nhas been subject, as a general rule, to droughts, and the destructive\r\nvisits of grasshoppers and other insects. The soil has a great quantity\r\nof alkali in it; it is an excessively dry climate; it very seldom rains,\r\nand dews are almost unknown here: almost destitute of timber. *** It is\r\ngenerally supposed that game is plenty about here. This is an erroneous\r\nimpression. There are but a very few small streams, an entire absence of\r\nlakes, and an almost entire destitution of timber—the whole country\r\nbeing one wilderness of dry prairie for hundreds of miles around; hence\r\nthere is but a very little small game, fish, or wild fruit to be found.\r\nIn former times the buffalo roamed over this country, but they have\r\nreceded, and very seldom come here in any numbers. *** The Indians must\r\nhave horses to hunt them: horses they have not. The Winnebagoes had some\r\nwhen they first arrived, but they were soon stolen by the hostile\r\nSioux.\"\r\n\r\nAgent Balcombe must have led a hard life on this reservation. Exposed to\r\nall the inconveniences of a remote frontier, three hundred miles from\r\nany food-raising country; receiving letters from the Interior Department\r\nexpressing itself \"astounded\" that he does not \"induce the Indians in\r\nhis charge to remain on their reservation;\" and letters from citizens,\r\nand petitions from towns in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska,\r\nimploring him to \"gather up\" all the wandering Winnebagoes who have been\r\nleft behind; unprovided with any proper military protection, and\r\nsurrounded by hostile Indians—no wonder that he recommends to the\r\nGovernment \"to remove and consolidate\" the different tribes of Indians\r\ninto \"one territory\" as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this sojourn in the wilderness upon the Winnebagoes were\r\nterrible. Not only were they rendered spiritless and desperate by\r\nsufferings, they were demoralized by being brought again into conflict\r\nwith the wild Sioux. They had more than one skirmish with them, and, it\r\nis said, relapsed so far into the old methods of their barbaric life\r\nthat at one of their dances they actually roasted and ate the heart of a\r\nSioux prisoner! Yet in less than a year after they were gathered\r\ntogether once more on the Omaha Reservation, and began again to have\r\nhopes of a \"permanent home,\" we find their chiefs and headmen sending\r\nthe following petition to Washington:\r\n\r\n\"OUR GREAT FATHER AT WASHINGTON, ALL GREETING,—From the chiefs, braves,\r\nand headmen of your dutiful children the Winnebagoes.\r\n\r\n\"Father, we cannot see you. You are far away from us. We cannot speak to\r\nyou. We will write to you; and, Father, we hope you will read our letter\r\nand answer us.\r\n\r\n\"Father: Some years ago, when we had our homes on Turkey River, we had a\r\nschool for our children, where many of them learned to read and write\r\nand work like white people, and we were happy.\r\n\r\n\"Father: Many years have passed away since our school was broken up; we\r\nhave no such schools among us, and our children are growing up in\r\nignorance of those things that should render them industrious,\r\nprosperous, and happy, and we are sorry. Father: It is our earnest wish\r\nto be so situated no longer. It is our sincere desire to have again\r\nestablished among us such a school as we see in operation among your\r\nOmaha children. Father: As soon as you find a permanent home for us,\r\nwill you not do this for us? And, Father, as we would like our children\r\ntaught the Christian religion, as before, we would like our school\r\nplaced under the care of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions. And\r\nlast, Father, to show you our sincerity, we desire to have set apart for\r\nits establishment, erection, and support, all of our school-funds and\r\nwhatever more is necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Father: This is our prayer. Will not you open your ears and heart to\r\nus, and write to us?\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was signed by thirty-eight of the chiefs and headmen of the\r\nWinnebagoes.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1865, a new treaty was made between the United States and this\r\nlong-suffering tribe of Indians, by which, in consideration of their\r\n\"ceding, selling, and conveying\" to the United States all their right in\r\nthe Dakota Reserve, the United States agreed \"to set apart for the\r\noccupation and future home of the Winnebago Indians forever\" a certain\r\ntract of 128,000 acres in Nebraska—a part of the Omaha Reservation which\r\nthe Omahas were willing to sell. The United States also agreed to erect\r\nmills, break land, furnish certain amounts of seeds, tools, guns, and\r\nhorses, oxen and wagons, and to subsist the tribe for one year, as some\r\nsmall reparation for the terrible losses and sufferings they had\r\nexperienced. From this word \"forever\" the Winnebagoes perhaps took\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nAt the time of their removal from Minnesota, among the fugitives who\r\nfled back to Wisconsin was the chief De Carry. He died there, two years\r\nlater, in great poverty. He was very old, but remarkably intelligent; he\r\nwas the grandson of Ho-po-ko-e-kaw, or \"Glory of the Morning,\" who was\r\nthe queen of the Winnebagoes in 1776, when Captain Carver visited the\r\ntribe. There is nothing in Carver's quaint and fascinating old story\r\nmore interesting than his account of the Winnebago country. He stayed\r\nwith them four days, and was entertained by them \"in a very\r\ndistinguished manner.\" Indeed, if we may depend upon Captain Carver's\r\nstory, all the North-western tribes were, in their own country, a\r\ngracious and hospitable people. He says: \"I received from every tribe of\r\nthem the most hospitable and courteous treatment, and am convinced that,\r\ntill they are contaminated by the example and spirituous liquors of\r\ntheir more refined neighbors, they will retain this friendly and\r\ninoffensive conduct toward strangers.\"\r\n\r\nHe speaks with great gusto of the bread that the Winnebago women made\r\nfrom the wild maize. The soft young kernels, while full of milk, are\r\nkneaded into a paste, the cakes wrapped in bass-wood leaves, and baked\r\nin the ashes. \"Better flavored bread I never ate in any country,\" says\r\nthe honest captain.\r\n\r\nHe found the Winnebagoes' home truly delightful. The shores of the lake\r\nwere wooded with hickory, oak, and hazel. Grapes, plums, and other\r\nfruits grew in abundance. The lake abounded in fish; and in the fall of\r\nthe year with geese, ducks, and teal, the latter much better flavored\r\nthan those found nearer the sea, as they \"acquire their excessive\r\nfatness by feeding on the wild rice which grows so plentifully in these\r\nparts.\"\r\n\r\nHow can we bear to contrast the picture of this peace, plenty, and\r\ngracious hospitality among the ancient Winnebagoes with the picture of\r\ntheir descendants—only two generations later—hunted, driven, starved?\r\nAnd how can we bear to contrast the picture of the drunken, gambling\r\nWinnebago of Minnesota with this picture which Captain Carver gives of a\r\nyoung Winnebago chief with whom he journeyed for a few days?\r\n\r\nCaptain Carver, after a four days' visit with the Winnebagoes, and\r\n\"having made some presents to the good old queen, and received her\r\nblessing,\" went on his way. Two months later, as he was travelling to\r\nthe Falls of St. Anthony, he encountered a young Winnebago chief going\r\non an embassy to some of the bands of the \"Nadouwessies\" (Sioux). This\r\nyoung chief, finding that Captain Carver was about to visit the Falls,\r\nagreed to accompany him, \"his curiosity having been often excited by the\r\naccounts he had received from some of his chiefs. He accordingly left\r\nhis family (for the Indians never travel without their households) at\r\nthis place under charge of my Mohawk servant, and we proceeded together\r\nby land, attended only by my Frenchman, to this celebrated place. We\r\ncould distinctly hear the noise of the water full fifty miles before we\r\nreached the Falls; and I was greatly pleased and surprised when I\r\napproached this astonishing work of nature; but I was not long at\r\nliberty to indulge these emotions, my attention being called off by the\r\nbehavior of my companion. The prince had no sooner gained the point that\r\noverlooks this wonderful cascade than he began with an audible voice to\r\naddress the Great Spirit, one of whose places of residence he imagined\r\nthis to be. He told him that he had come a long way to pay his\r\nadorations to him, and now would make him the best offerings in his\r\npower. He accordingly threw his pipe into the stream; then the roll that\r\ncontained his tobacco; after these the bracelets he wore on his arms and\r\nwrists; next an ornament that encircled his neck, composed of beads and\r\nwires; and at last the ear-rings from his ears; in short, he presented\r\nto his god every part of his dress that was valuable. During this he\r\nfrequently smote his breast with great violence, threw his arms about,\r\nand appeared to be much agitated. All this while he continued his\r\nadorations, and at length concluded them with fervent petitions that the\r\nGreat Spirit would constantly afford us his protection on our travels,\r\ngiving us a bright sun, a blue sky, and clear, untroubled waters; nor\r\nwould he leave the place till we had smoked together with my pipe in\r\nhonor of the Great Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"I was greatly surprised at beholding an instance of such elevated\r\ndevotion in so young an Indian. *** Indeed, the whole conduct of this\r\nyoung prince at once charmed and amazed me. During the few days we were\r\ntogether his attention seemed to be totally employed in yielding me\r\nevery assistance in his power, and even in so short a time he gave me\r\ninnumerable proofs of the most generous and disinterested friendship, so\r\nthat on our return I parted from him with the greatest reluctance.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the report from the Winnebagoes is that they are \"improving;\"\r\nmanifest \"a good degree of industry;\" that the health of the tribe is\r\ngenerally poor, but \"as good as can be expected when we remember their\r\nexposures and sufferings during the last three years.\" The tribe has\r\n\"diminished some four or five hundred since they left Minnesota.\" One\r\nhundred soldiers have returned, \"who have served with credit to\r\nthemselves and to their tribe in the defence of their country.\" No\r\nschool has yet been established on the agency, and this is said to be\r\n\"their greatest want.\"\r\n\r\nThe superintendent writes: \"The appropriations under the late treaty\r\nhave all been made, and the work of fitting up the reservation is\r\nprogressing. It affords me the highest personal satisfaction to assure\r\nthe Department that this deeply-wronged and much-abused tribe will soon\r\nbe in all respects comfortable and self-sustaining. They entered upon\r\ntheir new reservation late last May, and during the present year they\r\nhave raised at least twenty thousand bushels of corn.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs says: \"The Winnebagoes have a\r\njust claim against the Government on account of their removal from\r\nMinnesota, the expenses of which _were borne out of their own tribal\r\nfunds_. The Government is clearly bound in all honor to refund to them\r\nmoneys thus expended.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem that there could have been no question in the beginning as\r\nto who should pay the costs of such a removal as that. It should not\r\neven have been a tax on the general Government, but on the State of\r\nMinnesota, which demanded it—especially as there was no shadow of doubt\r\nthat the demand was made—not because the citizens of Minnesota had any\r\nreal fear of the peaceable and kindly Winnebagoes (who were as much in\r\nterror of the Sioux as they were themselves), but because they \"coveted\r\nthe splendid country the Winnebagoes were occupying, and the Sioux\r\ndifficulties furnished the pretext to get rid of them with the aid of\r\nCongressional legislation.\"\r\n\r\nSome members of the tribe who remained in Minnesota still claimed their\r\n\"allotted\" lands; \"their share of all moneys payable to the Winnebagoes\r\nunder treaty stipulations, and that their share of the funds of the\r\ntribe be capitalized and paid to them in bulk; their peculiar relations\r\nas Indians be dissolved, and they left to merge themselves in the\r\ncommunity where they have cast their lot.\" The commissioner urges upon\r\nthe Government compliance with these requests.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 a school was opened on the Winnebago Agency, and had a daily\r\nattendance of one hundred and fifty scholars. The tribe adopted a code\r\nof laws for their government, and the year was one of peace and\r\nquietness, with the exception of some dissatisfaction on the part of the\r\nIndians in regard to three hundred cows, which, having been sent to the\r\nagency in fulfilment of one of the provisions of the treaty, were\r\nnevertheless ordered by the Indian Bureau to be \"kept as Department\r\nstock.\" The Indians very naturally held that they had a right to these\r\ncows; nevertheless, they continued peaceable and contented, in the\r\nfeeling that they had \"at last found a home,\" where they might \"hope to\r\nremain and cultivate the soil with the feeling that it is theirs, and\r\nthat their children will not in a few days be driven from their\r\nwell-tilled and productive lands.\" They are, however, \"growing\r\nexceedingly anxious for the allotment of their lands in severalty.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1869 \"preparations\" were \"being made for allotting the lands to heads\r\nof families.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1870 \"the allotment of land in severalty to the Indians has been\r\nnearly completed, each head of a family receiving eighty acres. *** The\r\nIndians anxiously look for the patents to these, as many have already\r\ncommenced making improvements. *** At least thirty have broken four\r\nacres of prairie apiece, and several have built houses. *** Three\r\nschools are in operation, and four hundred acres of ground under\r\ncultivation.\"\r\n\r\nIn this year comes also an interesting report from the stray Winnebagoes\r\nleft behind in Wisconsin. They and the stray Pottawattomies? who are in\r\nthe same neighborhood are \"remarkably quiet and inoffensive, giving no\r\ncause of complaint; on the contrary, the towns and villages where they\r\ntrade their berries, maple-sugar, etc., are deriving considerable\r\nbenefit from them: a number have been employed in lumbering, harvesting,\r\nand hop-picking. A number of mill-owners and lumbermen have informed me\r\nthat the Indians they have employed in their business have been steady,\r\ngood hands. *** There are nearly one thousand of these Winnebagoes. Some\r\nof them have bought land; others are renting it; and all express an\r\nanxiety that the 'Great Father' should give them a reservation in this\r\nregion, and allow them to remain.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the Nebraska Winnebagoes deposed their old chiefs, and elected\r\ntwelve new ones, to serve one year; these were mainly from the younger\r\nmembers of the tribe who were in favor of civilization and progress.\r\nThis was an important step toward breaking up the old style of tribal\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 we hear again from the \"strays\" in Wisconsin. The whites having\r\ncomplained of them, Congress has appropriated funds to move them to\r\ntheir respective tribes \"west of the Mississippi;\" but the removal has\r\nnot been undertaken \"for various reasons,\" and the commissioner doubts\r\n\"whether it can be accomplished without additional and severe\r\nlegislation on the part of Congress, as the Indians are attached to the\r\ncountry, and express great repugnance to their contemplated removal from\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor creatures are not wanted anywhere. Spite of their being\r\n\"steady, good hands\" for hired labor, and useful to towns and villages\r\nin furnishing fruits and fish, the Wisconsin people do not want them in\r\ntheir State. And the agent of the Winnebago Reservation writes,\r\nearnestly protesting against their being brought there. He thinks they\r\nare in moral tone far below the Indians under his charge. Moreover, he\r\nsays \"the prejudice in the surrounding country is such\" that he believes\r\nit would be bad policy to remove any \"more Indians\" there. Nebraska does\r\nnot like Indians any better than Wisconsin does, or Minnesota did. He\r\nadds also that his Indians \"would be greatly stimulated to improve their\r\nclaims if they could secure the titles for them. They have waited three\r\nyears since the first allotments were made. It is difficult to make them\r\nbelieve that it requires so long a time to prepare the patents, and they\r\nare beginning to fear that they are not coming.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the Winnebagoes are cited as a \"striking example of what can be\r\naccomplished in a comparatively short time in the way of civilizing and\r\nChristianizing Indians. *** Their beautiful tract of country is dotted\r\nover with substantially-built cottages; the farmers own their wagons,\r\nhorses, harness, furniture of their houses—dress in civilized costume,\r\nraise crops—and several hundred Winnebago men assisted the farmers in\r\nadjoining counties during the late harvest in gathering their grain\r\ncrop, and proved themselves efficient and satisfactory workmen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1874 the Wisconsin \"strays\" were moved down to the\r\nNebraska Reservation. They were discontented, fomented dissatisfaction\r\nin the tribe, and in less than a year more than half of them had\r\nwandered back to Wisconsin again; a striking instance of the differences\r\nin the Government's methods of handling different bands of Indians. The\r\nthirty Poncas who ran away from Indian Territory were pursued and\r\narrested, as if they had been thieves escaping with stolen property; but\r\nmore than five hundred Winnebagoes, in less than one year, stroll away\r\nfrom their reserve, make their way back to Wisconsin, and nothing is\r\ndone about it.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 there are only two hundred and four of the Wisconsin \"strays\"\r\nleft on the Nebraska Reservation. All the others are \"back in their old\r\nhaunts, where a few seem to be making a sincere effort to take care of\r\nthemselves by taking land under the Homestead Act.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska Winnebagoes are reported as being \"nearly civilized;\" all\r\nare engaged in civilized pursuits, \"the men working with their own\r\nhands, and digging out of the ground three-fourths of their\r\nsubsistence.\" They have raised in this year 20,000 bushels of corn, 5800\r\nbushels of wheat, and 6000 bushels of oats and vegetables. They have\r\nbroken 800 acres of new land, and have built 3000 rods of fencing.\r\nNearly one-sixth of the entire tribe is in attendance at schools. The\r\nsystem of electing chiefs annually works well; the chiefs, in their\r\nturn, select twelve Indians to serve for the year as policemen, and they\r\nprove efficient in maintaining order.\r\n\r\nWhat an advance in six years! Six years ago there were but twenty-three\r\nhomes and only 300 acres of land under cultivation on the whole\r\nreservation; the people were huddled together in ravines and\r\nbottom-lands, and were dying of disease and exposure.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the Winnebagoes are reported again as \"fast emerging from a\r\ncondition of dependence upon their annual appropriations. *** Each head\r\nof a family has a patent for eighty acres of land. Many have fine farms,\r\nand are wholly supporting themselves and families by their own industry.\r\n*** The issue of rations has been discontinued, except to the Wisconsin\r\nbranch of the tribe and to the sick-list.\"\r\n\r\nIn what does this report differ from the report which would be rendered\r\nfrom any small farming village in the United States? The large majority\r\n\"wholly supporting themselves and their families by their own industry;\"\r\na small minority of worthless or disabled people being fed by\r\ncharity—_i.e._, being fed on food bought, at least in part, by interest\r\nmoney due on capital made by sales of land in which they had a certain\r\nreckonable share of ownership. Every one of the United States has in\r\nnearly every county an almshouse, in which just such a class of\r\nworthless and disabled persons will be found; and so crowded are these\r\nalmshouses, and so appreciable a burden is their support on the\r\ntax-payers of State and county, that there are perpetual disputes going\r\non between the authorities of neighboring districts as to the ownership\r\nand responsibility of individual paupers: for the paupers in civilized\r\nalmshouses are never persons who have had proceeds of land sales\r\n\"invested\" for their benefit, the interest to be paid to them \"annually\r\nforever.\" It is for nobody's interest to keep them paupers, or to take\r\ncare of them as such.\r\n\r\nWe now find the Winnebagoes once more quietly established in comfortable\r\nhomes—as they were, in their own primitive fashion, in 1822, when Dr.\r\nMorse visited them on the shores of their beautiful lake; as they were,\r\nafter our civilized fashion, in 1862, on the healthful and fertile\r\nup-lands of Minnesota. In their present home they seem to have reason,\r\nat last, to feel secure, to anticipate permanence, safety, and success.\r\nTheir lands have been allotted to them in severalty: each head of a\r\nfamily has his patent for eighty acres. They are, in the main,\r\nself-supporting.\r\n\r\nHow does the United States Government welcome this success, this heroic\r\ntriumph of a patient people over disheartening obstacles and sufferings?\r\n\r\nIn the Annual Report of the Secretary of the Interior for 1876 the\r\nSecretary says: \"As a matter of economy, the greatest saving could be\r\nmade by uniting all the Indians upon a few reservations; the fewer, the\r\nbetter.\" He says that there is land enough in the Indian Territory to\r\ngive every Indian—man, woman, and child—in the country seventy-five\r\nacres apiece. He says, \"The arguments are all in favor of the\r\nconsolidation.\" He then goes on to enumerate those arguments: \"Expensive\r\nagencies would be abolished; the Indians themselves can be more easily\r\nwatched over and controlled; evil-designing men be the better kept away\r\nfrom them, and illicit trade and barter in arms and ammunition and\r\nwhiskey prevented. Goods could be supplied at a greater saving; the\r\nmilitary service relieved; the Indians better taught, and friendly\r\nrivalry established among them—those most civilized hastening the\r\nprogress of those below them; and _most of the land now occupied as\r\nreserves reverting to the General Government, would be open to entry and\r\nsale_.\"\r\n\r\nHere are nine reasons given for removing all Indians to Indian\r\nTerritory. Five of these reasons ostensibly point to benefits likely to\r\naccrue from this removal to the Indians. The other four point to\r\nbenefits likely to accrue to the Government; the first three of these\r\nlast are, simply, \"saving;\" the fourth is the significant one,\r\n\"gain\"—\"most of the land reverting to the General Government would be\r\nopen to entry and sale.\"\r\n\r\nIt was before this necessity of opening Indian lands \"to entry and sale\"\r\nthat the Winnebagoes had been fleeing, from 1815 to 1863. It seems they\r\nare no safer now. There is evidently as much reason for moving them out\r\nof Nebraska as there was for moving them out of Wisconsin and Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary goes on to say: \"As soon as the Indian is taught to toil\r\nfor his daily bread, and realize the sense of proprietorship in the\r\nresults of his labor, it cannot but be further to his advantage to be\r\nable to appreciate that his labor is expended upon his individual\r\npossessions and for his personal benefit. *** The Indian must be made to\r\nsee the practical advantage to himself of his work, and feel that he\r\nreaps the full benefit of it. Everything should teach him that he has a\r\nhome; *** a hearth-stone of his own, around which he can gather his\r\nfamily, and in its possession be entirely secure and independent.\"\r\n\r\nThe logical relation of these paragraphs to the preceding one is\r\nstriking, and the bearing of the two together on the case of the\r\nWinnebagoes is still more striking.\r\n\r\nIn the same report the Commissioner for Indian Affairs says: \"If\r\nlegislation were secured giving the President authority to remove any\r\ntribe or band, or any portion of a tribe or band, whenever in his\r\njudgment it was practicable, to any one of the reservations named, and\r\nif Congress would appropriate from year to year a sum sufficient to\r\nenable him to take advantage of every favorable opportunity to make such\r\nremovals, I am confident that a few years' trial would conclusively\r\ndemonstrate the entire feasibility of the plan. I believe that all the\r\nIndians in Kansas, Nebraska, and Dakota, and a part at least of those in\r\nWyoming and Montana, could be induced to remove to the Indian\r\nTerritory.\"\r\n\r\nHe adds \"that the Indian sentiment is opposed to such removal is true,\"\r\nbut he thinks that, \"with a fair degree of persistence,\" the removal\r\n\"can be secured.\" No doubt it can.\r\n\r\nLater in the same report, under the head of \"Allotments in Severalty,\"\r\nhe says: \"It is doubtful whether any high degree of civilization is\r\npossible without individual ownership of land. The records of the past,\r\nand the experience of the present, testify that the soil should be made\r\nsecure to the individual by all the guarantees which law can devise, and\r\nthat nothing less will induce men to put forth their best exertions. It\r\nis essential that each individual should feel that his home is his own;\r\n*** that he has a direct personal interest in the soil on which he\r\nlives, and that that interest will be faithfully protected for him and\r\nfor his children by the Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioner and the secretary who wrote these clear statements of\r\nevident truths, and these eloquent pleas for the Indians' rights, both\r\nknew perfectly well that hundreds of Indians had had lands \"allotted to\r\nthem\" in precisely this way, and had gone to work on the lands so\r\nallotted, trusting \"that that interest would be faithfully protected by\r\nthe Government;\" and that these \"allotments,\" and the \"certificates\" of\r\nthem, had proved to be good for nothing as soon as the citizens of a\r\nState united in a \"demand\" that the Indians should be moved. The\r\ncommissioner and the secretary knew perfectly well, at the time they\r\nwrote these paragraphs, that in this one Winnebago tribe in Nebraska,\r\nfor instance, \"every head of a family owned eighty acres of land,\" and\r\nwas hard at work on it—industrious, self-supporting, trying to establish\r\nthat \"hearth-stone\" around which, as the secretary says, he must \"gather\r\nhis family, and in its possession be entirely secure and independent.\"\r\nAnd yet the secretary and the commissioner advise the moving of this\r\nWinnebago tribe to Indian Territory with the rest: \"all the Indians in\r\nKansas, Nebraska, and Dakota\" could probably be \"induced to move,\" they\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nThese quotations from this report of the Interior Department are but a\r\nfair specimen of the velvet glove of high-sounding phrase of\r\nphilanthropic and humane care for the Indian, by which has been most\r\neffectually hid from the sight of the American people the iron hand of\r\ninjustice and cruelty which has held him for a hundred years helpless in\r\nits grasp.\r\n\r\nIn this same year an agent on one of the Nebraska agencies writes\r\nfeelingly and sensibly:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing has tended to retard the progress of this tribe in the line of\r\nopening farms for themselves so much as the unsettlement occasioned by a\r\ncontinued agitation of the subject of selling their reservation and the\r\nremoval of the tribe. *** The improvement that has been made at this\r\nagency during the past three years in the direction of developing among\r\nthe Indians the means of self-support, seems to have caused an\r\nuneasiness that has been prolific of a great deal of annoyance, inasmuch\r\nas it has alarmed this speculative element around us with the fear that\r\nthe same (continued) will eventually plant the Indians on their present\r\nfertile land so firmly that they cannot be removed, and thus they be\r\ndeprived of the benefits of manipulating the sale of their reservation.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Winnebagoes keep on in their work—building houses,\r\nschool-buildings, many of them of brick made on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn this year (1876) they experienced a great injustice in the passing of\r\nan Act of Congress fixing the total amount to be expended for pay of\r\nemployés at any one agency at not more than $10,000. This necessitated\r\nthe closing of the fine building they had built at a cost of $20,000 for\r\nthe purpose of an industrial boarding-school.\r\n\r\nIn this year's report their agent gives a resumé of the financial\r\ncondition of the tribe: \"By treaty proclaimed June 16th, 1838, the\r\nWinnebagoes ceded to the United States all their land east of the\r\nMississippi, in consideration of which they were to receive $1,100,000.\r\nThe balance of this, after making certain payments, was to be invested\r\nfor their benefit, on which the United States guaranteed to pay them an\r\nannual interest of not less than five per cent.\r\n\r\n\"The Winnebagoes receive no support from the Government, other than from\r\nthe interest appropriated annually on what remains of these funds. This\r\nin 1870 amounted to over $50,000. Since then the half-breeds, numbering\r\none hundred and sixty persons, members of the tribe remaining in\r\nMinnesota at the time of the removal of the Indians from that State in\r\n1863, have, in accordance with the provisions of the act making\r\nappropriations for the Indian service, approved March 3d, 1871, been\r\npaid their proportion of the principal of all Winnebago funds, as shown\r\non the books of the Treasury at that time, including the proportion of\r\n$85,000, on which but five more instalments of interest were to be paid,\r\nper fourth Article treaty October 13th, 1846. In computing this\r\nproportion, the whole number of the tribe considered as being entitled\r\nto participate in the benefits of the tribal funds was 1531; which\r\nnumber included only those located on the Winnebago reservation in\r\nNebraska at that time, in addition to the one hundred and sixty already\r\nspoken of. By this Act of Congress the Nebraska Winnebagoes, who\r\ncomprise only that portion of the tribe which has complied with treaty\r\nstipulations, and quietly acquiesced in the demands of the Government,\r\nwere deprived of nearly one-eighth part of their accustomed support.\r\n\r\n\"Other reductions were afterward made for the purchase of a reservation\r\nadjoining the old one in this State, and for removing to it the\r\nwandering bands of Winnebagoes in Wisconsin. These were supposed to have\r\nnumbered in all nearly one thousand persons. They had not been in the\r\nhabit of receiving any attention or acknowledgment from the Government\r\nsince they, as a tribal organization, had declined to treat with it.\r\nNearly all of them objected to removing from Wisconsin to their new\r\nreservation in Nebraska, and, as a natural consequence, soon returned\r\nafter being compelled to do so. At the present time there are probably\r\nless than one hundred of the number remaining here. For the past three\r\nyears the sum to which the Wisconsin Winnebagoes would have been\r\nentitled had they remained on their reservation, amounting in all to\r\n$48,521 07, has been set apart, awaiting such act of Congress as will\r\ngive relief in the premises; thus reducing the total amount received per\r\nannum by that portion of the tribe living on the reservation to but\r\nlittle more than one-half of what it was seven years ago. It seems\r\nneedless to say that they are very much dissatisfied at this, and that\r\nwhen they refer to the subject I have some difficulty in satisfying them\r\nas to the justice of the governmental policy in setting apart funds (to\r\nbe expended at some future time) for the benefit of certain individuals\r\nwho persist in absenting themselves from their reservation, while\r\nothers, who are absent but a few months, are deprived of all advantages\r\nfrom issues of supplies or payments that may have been made during their\r\nabsence.\"\r\n\r\nThis case is a good illustration of the working of the trustee relation\r\nbetween the United States Government and its wards.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 we find the Secretary of the Interior still recommending that\r\nthe Indians be \"gradually gathered together on smaller reservations,\" to\r\nthe end that \"greater facilities be afforded for civilization.\" He\r\nreiterates that \"the enjoyment and pride of individual ownership of\r\nproperty is one of the most effective civilizing agencies,\" and\r\nrecommends that \"allotments of small tracts of land should be made to\r\nthe heads of families on all reservations, to be held in severalty under\r\nproper restrictions, so that they may have fixed homes.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioner also recommends \"a steady concentration of the smaller\r\nbands of Indians on the larger reservations.\" He calls attention again\r\nto the fact that there are 58,000 square miles in the Indian Territory\r\n\"set apart for the use of Indians, and that there they can be fed and\r\nclothed at a greatly diminished expense; and, better than all, can be\r\nkept in obedience, and taught to become civilized and self-supporting.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reports that a bill has been\r\ndrawn \"providing for the removal and consolidation of certain Indians in\r\nthe States of Oregon, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and\r\nMinnesota, and the Territories of Washington and Dakota. *** A reduction\r\nof twenty-five reservations and eleven agencies will thus be effected.\r\n*** There will be restored to the public domain 17,642,455 acres of\r\nland.\" He says that \"further consolidations of like character are not\r\nonly possible, but expedient and advisable. *** There is a vast area of\r\nland in the Indian Territory not yet occupied.\"\r\n\r\nWith the same ludicrous, complacent logic as before, he proceeds to give\r\nas the reason for uprooting all these Indians from the homes where they\r\nare beginning to thrive and take root, and moving them again—for the\r\nthird, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh time, as it may be—the fact\r\nthat, \"among the most radical defects of the policy formerly pursued\r\nwith the Indians, has been the frequent changes in their location which\r\nhave been made. *** Permanent homes, sufficient aid to enable them to\r\nbuild houses, cultivate the soil, and to subsist them until they have\r\nharvested their first crops, will wean them entirely from their old\r\nmethods of life, and in the course of a few years enable them to become\r\nentirely self-supporting. *** Among the more forcible arguments which\r\ncan be presented in connection with this subject is the fact that the\r\nexpenses attending the removal and consolidation of the Indians, as\r\nherein proposed, _will be more than met from the sale of lands vacated_.\r\n*** Much of the land now owned by these Indians is valuable only for its\r\ntimber, and may be sold at an appraised value for an amount far in\r\nexcess of the price fixed by law, and yet leave a large margin of profit\r\nto the purchaser into whose hands the lands will fall. *** I can see no\r\nreason why the Government should not avail itself of these facts, and in\r\neffecting the consolidation of the Indians, and the opening of the lands\r\nfor settlement, sell the same for an amount sufficient to support the\r\nIndians in their new locations, without any actual drain on the Treasury\r\nin the future. *** The lands belong to the Indians, and they are clearly\r\nentitled to receive the full value of the same when sold.\"\r\n\r\nIn this sentence we reach the high-water mark of the sophistry and\r\ndishonesty of the Department's position. \"The lands belong to the\r\nIndians,\" but we will compel them to \"restore to the public domain\"\r\n(_i.e._, to give up to white settlers) 17,642,455 acres of them. The\r\nIndians \"are clearly entitled to receive the full value of the same when\r\nsold,\" but we will compel them to expend that \"full value\" in removing\r\nto a place where they do not want to go, opening new lands, building new\r\nhouses, buying new utensils, implements, furniture and stock, and\r\ngenerally establishing themselves, \"without any actual drain on the\r\nTreasury\" of the United States: and the Department of the Interior \"can\r\nsee no reason why the Government should not avail itself of these\r\nfacts.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is proposed with a view to the benefit of the Indians. The\r\nreport goes on to reiterate the same old story that the Indians must\r\nhave \"a perfect title to their lands;\" that they have come to feel that\r\nthey are at any time liable to be moved, \"whenever the pressure of white\r\nsettlers upon them may create a demand for their lands,\" and that they\r\n\"decline to make any improvements on their lands, even after an\r\nallotment in severalty has been made, until they have received their\r\npatents for the same,\" and that even \"after the issue of patents the\r\ndifficulties surrounding them do not cease.\" Evidently not, since, as we\r\nhave seen, it is now several years since every head of a family among\r\nthese Winnebagoes, whose \"removal\" the commissioner now recommends,\r\nsecured his \"patent\" for eighty acres of land.\r\n\r\nFinally, the commissioner says: \"Every means that human ingenuity can\r\ndevise, legal or illegal, has been resorted to for the purpose of\r\nobtaining possession of Indian lands.\" Of this there would seem to be\r\nleft no doubt in the mind of any intelligent person, after reading the\r\nabove quotations.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered that when the news of such schemes as these\r\nreaches the Indians on their reservations great alarm and discontent are\r\nthe result. We find in the reports from the Nebraska agencies for this\r\nyear unmistakable indications of disheartenment and anxiety. The\r\nWinnebagoes are reported to be very anxious to be made citizens. A\r\nmajority are in favor of it, \"provided the Government will adopt certain\r\nmeasures which they consider necessary for the care and protection of\r\ntheir property.\"\r\n\r\nThey have had a striking illustration of the disadvantage of not being\r\ncitizens, in an instance of the unpunished murder of one of their number\r\nby a white man. The story is related by the agent tersely and well, and\r\nis one of the notable incidents in the history of the relation between\r\nthe United States Government and its wards.\r\n\r\n\"Henry Harris, a Winnebago in good standing, an industrious man and a\r\nsuccessful farmer, was employed by Joseph Smith, a white man, to cut\r\nwood on his land in Dakota County, a short distance north of the\r\nreservation. While alone and thus engaged, on the 29th of last January,\r\nHarris was shot through the heart with a rifle-ball. I had his dead body\r\ntaken before the coroner of the county, and at the inquest held before\r\nthat officer it was shown, to the satisfaction of the jury that rendered\r\na verdict in accordance therewith, that the Indian came to his death at\r\nthe hands of one D. Balinska, who had been for many years leading a\r\nhermit's life on a tract of land that he owned adjoining the\r\nreservation, and who had threatened Harris's life a few months before,\r\nwhen they quarrelled about damages for corn destroyed by Balinska's\r\nhorse. There being snow on the ground at the time of the murder,\r\nBalinska was tracked from his home to the place where, under cover, he\r\ndid the shooting; and his shot-pouch, containing a moulded ball of the\r\nsame weight as the one cut from the body of the Indian, was found near\r\nby and identified. Notwithstanding this direct evidence, which was laid\r\nbefore the Grand-jury of Dakota County, that honorable body was\r\nunwilling to find a 'true bill;' for the reason, as I understand, that\r\nit was only an Indian that was killed, and it would not be popular to\r\nincur the expense of bringing the case to trial. This is but another\r\nillustration of the difficulty of punishing a white man for a wrong\r\ncommitted against an Indian. I need hardly say that the Indians, when\r\ncomparing this murder with that of a white man, committed eight years\r\nago by five of their young men—who, upon less direct evidence, were\r\nsentenced to imprisonment in the State Penitentiary for life—are struck\r\nwith the wonderful difference in the application of the same law to\r\nwhites and Indians.\"\r\n\r\nThe report from the Winnebago Agency for 1879 tells the story of the\r\nsequel to this unpunished murder of Henry Harris. The agent says: \"In my\r\nlast report I referred to the murder of one of our best Indian farmers\r\nby a white man, who was afterward arrested and discharged without trial,\r\nthough there was no question as to his guilt. As a sequel to this, one\r\nwhite man is known to have been killed last May by Holly Scott, a nephew\r\nof the murdered Indian; and another white man is supposed to have been\r\nkilled by Eddy Priest and Thomas Walker, two young Indians who have left\r\nfor Wisconsin. The murdered white men had temporarily stopped with the\r\nIndians. Their antecedents are unknown, and they are supposed to have\r\nbelonged to the fraternity of tramps. Holly Scott was arrested by the\r\nIndian police, and turned over to the authorities of Dakota County for\r\ntrial, the State Legislature having at its last session extended the\r\njurisdiction of that county over this reservation, by what authority I\r\nam unable to say.\r\n\r\n\"The effect of these murders was to unsettle the Indians, nearly all\r\nindustry being suspended for several weeks. They feared that the white\r\npeople would do as they did in Minnesota in 1862, after the Sioux\r\nmassacre, when the Winnebagoes were driven from their homes in\r\nMinnesota. *** A number of our most quiet and industrious men became\r\nalarmed, and moved their families to Wisconsin, encouraged in so doing\r\nby the hope of receiving from the Government a share of the funds which\r\nhave been set apart from the annual appropriations during the past four\r\nyears for the benefit of the Wisconsin Winnebagoes, and which they\r\nsuppose aggregate a large amount which will soon be paid in cash.\"\r\n\r\nThis brings the story of the Winnebagoes down to the present time. What\r\nits next chapter may be is saddening to think. It is said by those\r\nfamiliar with the Nebraska Indians that, civilized though they be, they\r\nwill all make war to the knife if the attempt is made by the Government\r\nto rob them of their present lands on the plea again of offering them a\r\n\"permanent home.\" That specious pretence has done its last duty in the\r\nUnited States service. No Indian is left now so imbecile as to believe\r\nit once more.\r\n\r\nWhether the Winnebagoes' \"patents\" in Nebraska would, in such a case,\r\nprove any stronger than did their \"certificates\" in Minnesota, and\r\nwhether the Winnebagoes themselves, peaceable and civilized though they\r\nbe, would side with the United States Government, or with their wronged\r\nand desperate brethren, in such an uprising, it would be hard to\r\npredict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                             THE CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees were the Eastern Mountaineers of America. Their country\r\nlay along the Tennessee River, and in the highlands of Georgia,\r\nCarolina, and Alabama—the loveliest region east of the Mississippi\r\nRiver. Beautiful and grand, with lofty mountains and rich valleys\r\nfragrant with flowers, and forests of magnolia and pine filled with the\r\nsinging of birds and the melody of streams, rich in fruits and nuts and\r\nwild grains, it was a country worth loving, worth fighting, worth dying\r\nfor, as thousands of its lovers have fought and have died, white men as\r\nwell as red, within the last hundred years.\r\n\r\nWhen Oglethorpe came with his cargo of Madeira wine and respectable\r\npaupers from England in 1733, and lived in tents in midwinter on the\r\nshores of the Savannah River, one of the first conditions of safety for\r\nhis colossal almshouse, in shape of a new colony, was that all the\r\nIndians in the region should become its friends and allies.\r\n\r\nThe reputation of his goodness and benevolence soon penetrated to the\r\nfastnesses of their homes, and tribe after tribe sent chiefs and headmen\r\nto greet him with gifts and welcome. When the Cherokee chief appeared,\r\nOglethorpe said to him, \"Fear nothing. Speak freely.\" \"I always speak\r\nfreely,\" answered the mountaineer. \"Why should I fear? I am now among\r\nfriends: I never feared, even among my enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal intention of the English trustees who incorporated the\r\nGeorgia colony was to provide a home for worthy persons in England who\r\nwere \"in decayed circumstances.\" Among other great ends which they also\r\navowed was \"the civilization of the savages.\" In one of Oglethorpe's\r\nfirst reports to the trustees he says: \"A little Indian nation—the only\r\none within fifty miles—is not only in amity, but desirous to be subjects\r\nto his Majesty King George; to have lands given to them among us, and to\r\nbreed their children at our schools. Their chief and his beloved man,\r\nwho is the second man in the nation, desire to be instructed in the\r\nChristian religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe next year he returned to England, carrying with him eight Indian\r\nchiefs, to show them \"so much of Great Britain and her institutions as\r\nmight enable them to judge of her power and dignity. *** Nothing was\r\nneglected,\" we are told, \"that was likely to awaken their curiosity or\r\nimpress them with a sense of the power and grandeur of the nation.\" They\r\nwere received by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and by the Fellows of\r\nEton, and for a space of four months were hospitably entertained, and\r\nshown all the great sights of London and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe tribes at home were much gratified by these attentions paid to their\r\nrepresentatives, and sent out to the trustees a very curious missive,\r\nexpressing their thanks and their attachment to General Oglethorpe. This\r\nletter was the production of a young Cherokee chief. It was written in\r\nblack and red hieroglyphs on a dressed buffalo-skin. Before it was sent\r\nto England it was exhibited in Savannah, and the meaning of the\r\nhieroglyphs translated by an interpreter in a grand gathering of fifty\r\nIndian chiefs and all the principal people of Savannah. Afterward the\r\ncurious document was framed and hung up in the Georgia Office in\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nWhen the Wesleyan missionaries arrived in Georgia, two years later, some\r\nof the chiefs who had made this visit to England went to meet them,\r\ncarrying large jars of honey and of milk as gifts, to \"represent their\r\ninclinations;\" and one of the chiefs said to Mr. Wesley, \"I am glad you\r\nare come. When I was in England I desired that some one would speak the\r\nGreat Word to me. I will go up and speak to the wise men of our nation,\r\nand I hope they will hear. But we would not be made Christians as the\r\nSpaniards make Christians; we would be taught before we are baptized.\"\r\n\r\nIn those early days Wesley was an intolerant and injudicious enthusiast.\r\nHis missionary work in the Georgia Colony was anything but successful in\r\nthe outset, either among the whites or the Indians, and there was ample\r\njustification for the reply which this same Indian chief made later when\r\nurged to embrace the doctrines of Christianity.\r\n\r\n\"Why, these are Christians at Savannah. Those are Christians at\r\nFrederica. Christians get drunk! Christians beat men! Christians tell\r\nlies! Me no Christian!\" On another occasion Wesley asked him what he\r\nthought he was made for. \"He that is above,\" answered the chief, \"knows\r\nwhat he made us for. We know nothing; we are in the dark; but white men\r\nknow much. And yet white men build great houses, as if they were to live\r\nforever. But white men cannot live forever. In a little time white men\r\nwill be dust as well as I.\"\r\n\r\nFor twenty years Oglethorpe's colony struggled on under great\r\ndifficulties and discouragements. Wars with France and with Spain;\r\ntiresome squabbles with and among Methodist missionaries, all combined\r\nto make Oglethorpe's position hard. Again and again England would have\r\nlost her colony except for the unswerving fidelity of the Indian allies;\r\nthey gathered by hundreds to fight for Oglethorpe. In one expedition\r\nagainst the frontier, four hundred Creeks and six hundred Cherokees set\r\nout in one day, under an urgent call for help sent by Indian runners to\r\ntheir towns. His Indian friends were the only friends Oglethorpe had who\r\nstood by him past everything: nothing could shake their fidelity.\r\n\r\n\"He is poor; he can give you nothing,\" said the St. Augustine Spaniards\r\nto a Creek chief at this time; \"it is foolish for you to go to him:\" and\r\nthey showed to the Indian a fine suit of scarlet clothes, and a sword,\r\nwhich they were about to give to a chief of the Tennessees who had\r\nbecome their ally.\r\n\r\nBut the Creek answered, \"We love him. It is true, he does not give us\r\nsilver; but he gives us everything we want that he has. He has given me\r\nthe coat off his back, and the blanket from under him.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the trustees of the Georgia Colony lost patience: very bitterly\r\nthey had learned that paupers, however worthy, are not good stuff to\r\nbuild new enterprises of. In eighteen years the colony had not once\r\nfurnished a sufficient supply of subsistence for its own consumption:\r\nfarms which had been cultivated were going to ruin; and the country was\r\nrapidly degenerating in every respect. Dishonest traders had tampered\r\nwith and exasperated the Indians, so that their friendliness could no\r\nlonger be implicitly trusted. For everything that went wrong the English\r\nCompany was held responsible, and probably there were no happier men in\r\nall England on the 20th of June, 1752, than were the Georgia trustees,\r\nwho on that day formally resigned their charter, and washed their hands\r\nof the colony forever.\r\n\r\nThe province was now formed into a royal government, and very soon\r\nbecame the seat of frightful Indian wars. The new authorities neither\r\nunderstood nor kept faith with the Indians: their old friend Oglethorpe\r\nhad left them forever, and the same scenes of treachery and massacre\r\nwhich were being enacted at the North began to be repeated with\r\nheart-sickening similarity at the South. Indians fighting\r\nIndians—fighting as allies to-day with the French, to-morrow with the\r\nEnglish; treaties made, and broken as soon as made; there was neither\r\npeace nor safety anywhere.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1763, a treaty was concluded with the chiefs and headmen of\r\nfive tribes, which seemed to promise better things. The Cherokees and\r\nCreeks granted to the King of England a large tract of land, cleared off\r\ntheir debts with the sum paid for it, and observed its stipulations\r\nfaithfully for several years, until peace was again destroyed, this time\r\nby no fault of the Indians, in consequence of the revolt of the American\r\nColonies against Great Britain. The English loyalists in Georgia now\r\navailed themselves of the Indians' old habit of allegiance to the Crown.\r\nOne of their leading agents took a Cherokee woman as his mistress,\r\nplaced her at the head of his table, gave her the richest dress and\r\nequipage that the country could afford, and distributed through her\r\nlavish gifts to all the Indians he could reach. When war actually broke\r\nout he retreated with her into the fastnesses of the Cherokee nation,\r\nwhere he swayed them at his will. Attempts to capture him were repelled\r\nby the Cherokees with ferocity. Prisoners taken by them at this time\r\nwere tortured with great cruelty; one instance is recorded (in a journal\r\nkept by another prisoner, who escaped alive) of a boy about twelve years\r\nof age who was suspended by the arms between two posts, and raised about\r\nthree feet from the ground. \"The mode of inflicting the torture was by\r\nlight-wood splints of about eighteen inches long, made sharp at one end\r\nand fractured at the other, so that the torch might not be extinguished\r\nby throwing it. After these weapons of death were prepared, and a fire\r\nmade for the purpose of lighting them, the scene of horror commenced. It\r\nwas deemed a mark of dexterity, and accompanied by shouts of applause,\r\nwhen an Indian threw one of these torches so as to make the sharp end\r\nstick into the body of the suffering youth without extinguishing the\r\ntorch. This description of torture was continued for two hours before\r\nthe innocent victim was relieved by death.\"\r\n\r\nThese are sickening details, and no doubt will be instinctively set down\r\nby most readers as proof of innate cruelty peculiar to the Indian race.\r\nLet us, therefore, set side by side with them the record that in this\r\nsame war white men (British officers) confined white men (\"rebels\") in\r\nprison-ships, starved, and otherwise maltreated them till they died,\r\nfive or six a day, then threw their dead bodies into the nearest marsh,\r\nand had them \"_trodden down in the mud_—from whence they were soon\r\nexposed by the washing of the tides, and at low-water the prisoners\r\nbeheld the carrion-crows picking the bones of their departed\r\ncompanions!\" Also, that white men (British officers) were known at that\r\ntime to have made thumb-screws out of musket-locks, to torture Georgia\r\nwomen, wives of \"rebels,\" to force them to reveal the places where their\r\nhusbands were in hiding. Innate cruelty is not exclusively an Indian\r\ntrait.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees had the worst of the fighting on the British side during\r\nthe Revolution. Again and again their towns were burnt, their winter\r\nstores destroyed, and whole bands reduced to the verge of starvation. At\r\none time, when hard pressed by the American forces, they sent to the\r\nCreeks for help; but the shrewd Creeks replied, \"You have taken the\r\nthorns out of our feet; you are welcome to them.\" The Creeks, having\r\ngiven only limited aid to the British, had suffered much less severely.\r\nThat any of the Indians should have joined the \"rebel\" cause seems\r\nwonderful, as they had evidently nothing to gain by the transfer of\r\ntheir allegiance to what must have appeared to them for a long time to\r\nbe the losing side in the contest. For three years and a half Savannah\r\nwas in the possession of the British, and again and again they had\r\ncontrol of the entire State. And to show that they had no compunction\r\nabout inciting the Indians to massacres they left many a written\r\nrecord—such, for instance, as this, which is in a letter written by\r\nGeneral Gage from Boston, June, 1775: \"We need not be tender of calling\r\non the savages to attack the Americans.\"[29]\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Art. X.\r\n\r\nThe first diplomatic relations of the United States Government with the\r\nCherokees were in the making of the treaty of Hopewell, in 1785. At the\r\nHopewell council the United States commissioners said: \"Congress is now\r\nthe sovereign of all our country which we now point out to you on the\r\nmap. They want none of your lands, nor anything else which belongs to\r\nyou; and as an earnest of their regard for you, we propose to enter into\r\narticles of a treaty perfectly equal and conformable to what we now tell\r\nyou. *** This humane and generous act of the United States will no doubt\r\nbe received by you with gladness, and held in grateful remembrance; and\r\nthe more so, as many of your young men, and the greater number of your\r\nwarriors, during the late war, were our enemies, and assisted the King\r\nof Great Britain in his endeavors to conquer our country.\"\r\n\r\nThe chiefs complained bitterly of the encroachments of white settlers\r\nupon lands which had been by old treaties distinctly reserved to the\r\nCherokees. They demanded that some of these settlers should be removed;\r\nand when the commissioners said that the settlers were too numerous for\r\nthe Government to remove, one of the chiefs asked, satirically, \"Are\r\nCongress, who conquered the King of Great Britain, unable to remove\r\nthose people?\"\r\n\r\nFinally, the chiefs agreed to accept payment for the lands which had\r\nbeen taken. New boundaries were established, and a general feeling of\r\ngood-will and confidence was created. One notable feature in this\r\ncouncil was the speech of an Indian woman, called the \"war-woman of\r\nChota.\" (Chota was the Cherokees' city of refuge. All murderers were\r\nsafe so long as they lived in Chota. Even Englishmen had not disdained\r\nto take advantage of its shelter; one English trader who had killed an\r\nIndian, having fled, lived there for many months, his own house being\r\nbut a short distance away. After a time he resolved to return home, but\r\nthe headmen of the tribe assured him that, though he was entirely safe\r\nthere, he would surely be killed if he left the town.) The chief who\r\nbrought this \"war-woman\" to the council introduced her as \"one of our\r\nbeloved women who has borne and raised up warriors.\" She proceeded to\r\nsay, \"I am fond of hearing that there is a peace, and I hope you have\r\nnow taken us by the hand in real friendship. I have a pipe and a little\r\ntobacco to give the commissioners to smoke in friendship. I look on you\r\nand the red people as my children. Your having determined on peace is\r\nmost pleasing to me, for I have seen much trouble during the late war. I\r\nam old, but I hope yet to bear children who will grow up and people our\r\nnation, as we are now to be under the protection of Congress, and shall\r\nhave no disturbance.\"\r\n\r\nA brief summary of the events which followed on the negotiation of this\r\ntreaty may be best given in the words of a report made by the Secretary\r\nof War to the President four years later. In July, 1789, General Knox\r\nwrites as follows of the Cherokees: \"This nation of Indians, consisting\r\nof separate towns or villages, are seated principally on the head-waters\r\nof the Tennessee, which runs into the Ohio. Their hunting-grounds extend\r\nfrom the Cumberland River along the frontiers of Virginia, North and\r\nSouth Carolina, and part of Georgia.\r\n\r\n\"The frequent wars they have had with the frontier people of the said\r\nStates have greatly diminished their number. The commissioners estimated\r\nthem in November, 1785, at 2000 warriors, but they were estimated in\r\n1787 at 2650; yet it is probable they may be lessened since by the\r\ndepredations committed on them.\r\n\r\n\"The United States concluded a treaty with the Cherokees at Hopewell, on\r\nthe Keowee, the 28th of November, 1785, which is entered on the printed\r\njournals of Congress April 17th, 1786. The negotiations of the\r\ncommissioners on the part of the United States are hereunto annexed,\r\nmarked A. It will appear by the papers marked B. that the State of North\r\nCarolina, by their agent, protested against the said treaty as\r\ninfringing and violating the legislative rights of that State.\r\n\r\n\"By a variety of evidence which has been submitted to the last Congress,\r\nit has been proved that the said treaty has been entirely disregarded by\r\nthe white people inhabiting the frontiers, styling themselves the State\r\nof Franklin. The proceedings of Congress on the 1st of September, 1788,\r\nand the proclamation they then issued on this subject, will show their\r\nsense of the many unprovoked outrages committed against the Cherokees.\r\n\r\n\"The information contained in the papers marked C., from Colonel Joseph\r\nMartin, the late agent to the Cherokees, and Richard Winn, Esq., will\r\nfurther evince the deplorable situation of the Cherokees, and the\r\nindispensable obligation of the United States to vindicate their faith,\r\njustice, and national dignity.\r\n\r\n\"The letter of Mr. Winn, the late superintendent, of the 1st of March,\r\ninforms that a treaty will be held with the Cherokees on the third\r\nMonday of May, at the Upper War-ford on French Broad River. But it is to\r\nbe observed that the time for which both he and Colonel Joseph Martin,\r\nthe agent to the Cherokees and Chickasaws, were elected has expired, and\r\ntherefore they are not authorized to act on the part of the Union. If\r\nthe commissioners appointed by North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia, by virtue of the resolve of Congress of the 26th of October,\r\n1787, should attend the said treaty, their proceedings thereon may soon\r\nbe expected. But, as part of the Cherokees have taken refuge within the\r\nlimits of the Creeks, it is highly probable they will be under the same\r\ndirection; and, therefore, as the fact of the violation of the treaty\r\ncannot be disputed, and as the commissioners have not power to replace\r\nthe Cherokees within the limits established in 1785, it is not probable,\r\neven if a treaty should be held, as stated by Mr. Winn, that the result\r\nwould be satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the summing up of the situation. The details of it are to be\r\nread in copious volumes of the early history of Tennessee, North and\r\nSouth Carolina, and Georgia—all under the head of \"Indian Atrocities.\"\r\nTo very few who read those records does it occur that the Indians who\r\ncommitted these \"atrocities\" were simply ejecting by force, and, in the\r\ncontests arising from this forcible ejectment, killing men who had\r\nusurped and stolen their lands—lands ceded to them by the United States\r\nGovernment in a solemn treaty, of which the fifth Article was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"If any citizen of the United States or other person, not being an\r\nIndian, shall attempt to settle on any of the lands westward or\r\nsouthward of the said boundaries which are hereby allotted to the\r\nIndians for their hunting-grounds, or having already settled and will\r\nnot remove from the same within six months after the ratification of\r\nthis treaty, such person shall forfeit the protection of the United\r\nStates, and the Indians _may punish him or not as they please_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that it is necessary to go back to the days of the first\r\ntreaties with our Indians to possess ourselves of the first requisites\r\nfor fair judgment of their conduct toward white men. What would a\r\ncommunity of white men, situated precisely as these Cherokees were, have\r\ndone? What did these very Southern colonists themselves do to Spaniards\r\nwho encroached on their lands? Fought them; killed them; burnt their\r\nhouses over their heads, and drove them into the sea!\r\n\r\nIn a later communication in the same year to the President, the\r\nSecretary says: \"The disgraceful violation of the treaty of Hopewell\r\nwith the Cherokees requires the serious consideration of Congress. If so\r\ndirect and manifest contempt of the authority of the United States be\r\nsuffered with impunity, it will be in vain to attempt to extend the arm\r\nof the Government to the frontiers. The Indian tribes can have no faith\r\nin such imbecile promises, and the lawless whites will ridicule a\r\ngovernment which shall on paper only make Indian treaties and regulate\r\nIndian boundaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe President, thus entreated, addressed himself to the Senate, and\r\nasked their advice. He recapitulated the facts as set forth by General\r\nKnox, \"that upward of five hundred families are settled on the Cherokee\r\nlands,\" and asks,\r\n\r\n\"1st. Is it the judgment of the Senate that overtures shall be made to\r\nthe Cherokees to arrange a new boundary, so as to embrace the\r\nsettlements made by the white people since the treaty of Hopewell in\r\nNovember, 1785?\r\n\r\n\"2d. If so, shall compensation to the amount of $—— annually, or of $——\r\nin gross, be made to the Cherokees for the land they shall relinquish,\r\nholding the occupiers of the land accountable to the United States for\r\nits value?\r\n\r\n\"3d. Shall the United States stipulate solemnly to guarantee the new\r\nboundary which may be arranged?\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate thereupon resolved that the President should, at his\r\ndiscretion, cause the Hopewell treaty to be carried out, or make a new\r\none; but, in case a new one was made, the \"Senate do advise and consent\r\nsolemnly to guarantee the same.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in July, 1791, a new treaty—the treaty of Holston—was made\r\nwith the Cherokees, new boundaries established, and $1000 a year\r\npromised to the tribe for the lands relinquished.\r\n\r\nBy the seventh Article of this treaty the United States \"solemnly\r\nguarantee to the Cherokee nation all their lands not hereby ceded:\" the\r\neighth Article reiterates the old permission that if any citizen of the\r\nUnited States or other person (not an Indian) shall settle on the\r\nCherokees' lands, the Cherokees may punish him as they please. Article\r\nninth says that no citizen or inhabitant of the United States shall hunt\r\nor destroy game on the Cherokee lands, or go into the Cherokee country\r\nwithout a passport from the governor or some other authorized person.\r\n\r\nThe next year the Cherokees sent an embassy to Philadelphia to ask for\r\nan increase of $500 in their annuity. One of the chiefs said that he had\r\ntold Governor Blunt the year before that he would not consent to selling\r\nthe lands for $1000 a year. \"It would not buy a breech-clout for each of\r\nmy nation;\" which was literally true.\r\n\r\nTo this additional annuity the Senate consented, and with this the\r\nchiefs said they were \"perfectly satisfied.\" But they begged for the\r\nploughs, hoes, cattle, etc., which had been promised in the treaty. They\r\nsaid, \"Game is going fast away from among us. We must plant corn and\r\nraise cattle, and we want you to assist us.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1794 it was necessary to make another treaty, chiefly to declare that\r\nthe Holston treaty was in \"full force and binding.\" It had not been\r\n\"fully carried into execution by reason of misunderstandings,\" it was\r\nsaid. This was very true; white settlers had gone where they pleased, as\r\nif it did not exist; Cherokees had murdered them, as they were, by their\r\ntreaty, explicitly permitted to do. The whites had retaliated by\r\nunprovoked attacks on friendly Indians, and the Indians had retaliated\r\nagain. The exasperated Indians implored Congress to protect them: the\r\nstill more exasperated whites demanded of Congress to protect them. The\r\nSecretary of War writes despairingly, that \"The desire of too many\r\nfrontier white people to seize by force or fraud on the neighboring\r\nIndian lands continues to be an unceasing cause of jealousy and hatred\r\non the part of the Indians; and it would appear, upon a calm\r\ninvestigation, that until the Indians can be quieted on this point, and\r\nrely with confidence on the protection of their lands by the United\r\nStates, no well-grounded hope of tranquillity can be entertained.\"\r\n\r\nIn this miserable manner, unjust equally to the white men and to the\r\nIndians, affairs went on for several years, until in 1801 it became\r\nabsolutely necessary that in some way a definite understanding of\r\nboundaries, and an authoritative enforcement of rights on both sides,\r\nshould be brought about; accordingly, commissioners were sent by the\r\nPresident \"to obtain the consent of the Cherokees\" to new grants of land\r\nand establishment of boundaries. The instructions given to these\r\ncommissioners are remarkable for their reiterated assertion of the\r\nIndians' unquestioned right to do as they please about ceding these\r\nlands. Such phrases as these: \"Should the Indians refuse to cede to the\r\nUnited States any of the above-designated lands,\" and \"you will endeavor\r\nto prevail upon them to cede,\" and \"you will endeavor to procure the\r\nconsent of the Indians,\" are proof of the fulness of the recognition the\r\nUnited States Government at that time gave of the Indians' \"right of\r\noccupancy;\" also of the realization on the part of the Government that\r\nthese Indian nations were powers whose good-will it was of importance to\r\nconciliate. \"It is of importance,\" the instructions say, \"that the\r\nIndian nations generally should be convinced of the certainty in which\r\nthey may at all times rely upon the friendship of the United States, and\r\nthat the President will never abandon them or their children;\" and, \"It\r\nwill be incumbent on you to introduce the desires of the Government in\r\nsuch a manner as will permit you to drop them, as you may find them illy\r\nreceived, without giving the Indians an opportunity to reply with a\r\ndecided negative, or raising in them unfriendly and inimical\r\ndispositions. You will state none of them in the tone of demands, but in\r\nthe first instance merely mention them as propositions which you are\r\nauthorized to make, and their assent to which the Government would\r\nconsider as new testimonials of their friendship.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Cherokees did reply with \"a decided negative.\" They\r\nutterly refused to cede any more lands, or to give their consent to the\r\nopening of any more roads through their territory. But it only took four\r\nyears to bring them to the point where they were ready to acquiesce in\r\nthe wishes of the Government, and to make once more the effort to secure\r\nto themselves an unmolested region, by giving up several large tracts of\r\nland and a right of way on several roads. In 1805 they concluded another\r\ntreaty, ceding territory for which the United States thought it worth\r\nwhile to pay $15,000 immediately, and an annuity of $3000.\r\n\r\nTen years later (in 1816) they gave up all their lands in South\r\nCarolina, and the United States became surety that South Carolina should\r\npay to them $5000 for the same. In the autumn of the same year they made\r\nstill another cession of lands to the United States Government, for\r\nwhich they were to have an annuity of $6000 a year for ten years, and\r\n$5000 as compensation for the improvements they surrendered.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 an important treaty was concluded, making still further cessions\r\nof lands, and defining the position of a part of the Cherokee nation\r\nwhich had moved away, with the President's permission, to the Arkansas\r\nRiver in 1809. The eighth Article of this treaty promises that the\r\nUnited States will give to every head of an Indian family residing on\r\nthe east side of the Mississippi, who may wish to become a citizen, \"a\r\nreservation of six hundred and forty acres of land, in which they will\r\nhave a life estate, with a reversion in fee-simple to their children.\"\r\n\r\nWhat imagination could have foreseen that in less than twenty years the\r\nchiefs of this Cherokee nation would be found piteously pleading to be\r\nallowed to remain undisturbed on these very lands? In the whole history\r\nof our Government's dealings with the Indian tribes, there is no record\r\nso black as the record of its perfidy to this nation. There will come a\r\ntime in the remote future when, to the student of American history, it\r\nwill seem well-nigh incredible. From the beginning of the century they\r\nhad been steadily advancing in civilization. As far back as 1800 they\r\nhad begun the manufacture of cotton cloth, and in 1820 there was\r\nscarcely a family in that part of the nation living east of the\r\nMississippi but what understood the use of the card and spinning-wheel.\r\nEvery family had its farm under cultivation. The territory was laid off\r\ninto districts, with a council-house, a judge, and a marshal in each\r\ndistrict. A national committee and council were the supreme authority in\r\nthe nation. Schools were flourishing in all the villages.\r\nPrinting-presses were at work.\r\n\r\nTheir territory was larger than the three States of Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, and Connecticut combined. It embraced the North-western part of\r\nGeorgia, the North-east of Alabama, a corner of Tennessee and of North\r\nCarolina. They were enthusiastic in their efforts to establish and\r\nperfect their own system of jurisprudence. Missions of several sects\r\nwere established in their country, and a large number of them had\r\nprofessed Christianity, and were living exemplary lives.\r\n\r\nThere is no instance in all history of a race of people passing in so\r\nshort a space of time from the barbarous stage to the agricultural and\r\ncivilized. And it was such a community as this that the State of\r\nGeorgia, by one high-handed outrage, made outlaws!—passing on the 19th\r\nof December, 1829, a law \"to annul all laws and ordinances made by the\r\nCherokee nation of Indians;\" declaring \"all laws, ordinances, orders,\r\nand regulations of any kind whatever, made, passed, or enacted by the\r\nCherokee Indians, either in general council or in any other way\r\nwhatever, or by any authority whatever, null and void, and of no effect,\r\nas if the same had never existed; also, that no Indian, or descendant of\r\nany Indian residing within the Creek or Cherokee nations of Indians,\r\nshall be deemed a competent witness in any court of this State to which\r\na white man may be a party.\"\r\n\r\nWhat had so changed the attitude of Georgia to the Indians within her\r\nborders? Simply the fact that the Indians, finding themselves hemmed in\r\non all sides by fast thickening white settlements, had taken a firm\r\nstand that they would give up no more land. So long as they would cede\r\nand cede, and grant and grant tract after tract, and had millions of\r\nacres still left to cede and grant, the selfishness of white men took no\r\nalarm; but once consolidated into an empire, with fixed and inalienable\r\nboundaries, powerful, recognized, and determined, the Cherokee nation\r\nwould be a thorn in the flesh to her white neighbors. The doom of the\r\nCherokees was sealed on the day when they declared, once for all,\r\nofficially as a nation, that they would not sell another foot of land.\r\nThis they did in an interesting and pathetic message to the United\r\nStates Senate in 1822.\r\n\r\nGeorgia, through her governor and her delegates to Congress, had been\r\npersistently demanding to have the Cherokees compelled to give up their\r\nlands. She insisted that the United States Government should fulfil a\r\nprovision, made in an old compact of 1802, to extinguish the Indian\r\ntitles within her limits as soon as it could be peaceably done. This she\r\ndemanded should be done now, either peaceably or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot but view the design of those letters,\" says this message, \"as\r\nan attempt bordering on a hostile disposition toward the Cherokee nation\r\nto wrest from them by arbitrary means their just rights and liberties,\r\nthe security of which is solemnly guaranteed to them by these United\r\nStates. *** We assert under the fullest authority that all the\r\nsentiments expressed in relation to the disposition and determination of\r\nthe nation never to cede another foot of land, are positively the\r\nproduction and voice of the nation. *** There is not a spot out of the\r\nlimits of any of the States or Territories thereof, and within the\r\nlimits of the United States, that they would ever consent to inhabit;\r\nbecause they have unequivocally determined never again to pursue the\r\nchase as heretofore, or to engage in wars, unless by the common call of\r\nthe Government to defend the common rights of the United States. *** The\r\nCherokees have turned their attention to the pursuits of the civilized\r\nman: agriculture, manufactures, and the mechanic arts and education are\r\nall in successful operation in the nation at this time; and while the\r\nCherokees are peacefully endeavoring to enjoy the blessings of\r\ncivilization and Christianity on the soil of their rightful inheritance,\r\nand while the exertions and labors of various religious societies of\r\nthese United States are successfully engaged in promulgating to them the\r\nwords of truth and life from the sacred volume of Holy Writ, and under\r\nthe patronage of the General Government, they are threatened with\r\nremoval or extinction. *** We appeal to the magnanimity of the American\r\nCongress for justice, and the protection of the rights and liberties and\r\nlives of the Cherokee people. We claim it from the United States by the\r\nstrongest obligation which imposes it on them—by treaties: and we expect\r\nit from them under that memorable declaration, 'that all men are created\r\nequal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable\r\nrights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness.'\"\r\n\r\nThe dignified and pathetic remonstrances of the Cherokee chiefs, their\r\nfirm reiterations of their resolve not to part with their lands, were\r\ncalled by the angry Georgian governor \"tricks of vulgar cunning,\" and\r\n\"insults from the polluted lips of outcasts and vagabonds;\" and he is\r\nnot afraid, in an official letter to the Secretary of War, to openly\r\nthreaten the President that, if he upholds the Indians in their\r\nrejection of the overtures for removal, the \"consequences are\r\ninevitable,\" and that, in resisting the occupation of the Cherokee lands\r\nby the Georgians, he will be obliged to \"make war upon, and shed the\r\nblood of brothers and friends.\"\r\n\r\nTo these Cherokees Mr. Jefferson had written, at one time during his\r\nadministration, \"I sincerely wish you may succeed in your laudable\r\nendeavors to save the remnant of your nation by adopting industrious\r\noccupations, and a government of regular law. In this you may always\r\nrely on the counsel and assistance of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1791 he had written to General Knox, defining the United States'\r\nposition in the matter of Indian lands: \"Government should firmly\r\nmaintain this ground, that the Indians have a right to the occupation of\r\ntheir lands independent of the States within whose chartered lines they\r\nhappen to be; that until they cede them by treaty, or other transaction\r\nequivalent to treaty, no act of a State can give a right to such lands.\r\n*** The Government is determined to exert all its energy for the\r\npatronage and protection of the rights of the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the year before General Washington had said to the Six Nations: \"In\r\nfuture you cannot be defrauded of your lands. No State or person can\r\npurchase your lands unless at some public treaty held under the\r\nauthority of the United States. The General Government will never\r\nconsent to your being defrauded; but it will protect you in all your\r\njust rights. *** You possess the right to sell, and the right of\r\nrefusing to sell your lands. *** The United States will be true and\r\nfaithful to their engagements.\"\r\n\r\nWhat could Cherokee men and women have thought when, only thirty years\r\nlater, they found this United States Government upholding the State of\r\nGeorgia in her monstrous pretensions of right to the whole of their\r\ncountry, and in her infamous cruelties of oppression toward them? when\r\nthey found this United States Government sending its agents to seduce\r\nand bribe their chiefs to bargain away their country; even stooping to\r\nleave on the public records of official instructions to a commissioner\r\nsuch phrases as these: \"Appeal to the chiefs and influential men—not\r\ntogether, but apart, at their own houses;\" \"make offers to them of\r\nextensive reservations in fee-simple, and other rewards, to obtain their\r\nacquiescence;\" \"the more careful you are to secure from even the chiefs\r\nthe official character you bear, the better;\" \"enlarge on the advantage\r\nof their condition in the West: there the Government would protect\r\nthem.\" This the Secretary of War called \"moving on them in the line of\r\ntheir prejudices.\"\r\n\r\nIn a report submitted to the War Department in 1825 by Thomas L.\r\nMcKenney is a glowing description of the Cherokee country and nation at\r\nthat time: \"The country is well watered; abundant springs of pure water\r\nare found in every part; a range of majestic and lofty mountains stretch\r\nthemselves across it. The northern part is hilly and mountainous; in the\r\nsouthern and western parts there are extensive and fertile plains,\r\ncovered partly with tall trees, through which beautiful streams of water\r\nglide. These plains furnish immense pasturage, and numberless herds of\r\ncattle are dispersed over them; horses are plenty; numerous flocks of\r\nsheep, goats, and swine cover the valleys and the hills. On Tennessee,\r\nUstanula, and Canasagi rivers Cherokee commerce floats. The climate is\r\ndelicious and healthy; the winters are mild; the spring clothes the\r\nground with the richest scenery; flowers of exquisite beauty and\r\nvariegated hues meet and fascinate the eye in every direction. In the\r\nplains and valleys the soil is generally rich, producing Indian-corn,\r\ncotton, tobacco, wheat, oats, indigo, and sweet and Irish potatoes. The\r\nnatives carry on considerable trade with the adjoining States; some of\r\nthem export cotton in boats down the Tennessee to the Mississippi, and\r\ndown that river to New Orleans. Apple and peach orchards are quite\r\ncommon, and gardens are cultivated, and much attention paid to them.\r\nButter and cheese are seen on Cherokee tables. There are many public\r\nroads in the nation, and houses of entertainment kept by natives.\r\nNumerous and flourishing villages are seen in every section of the\r\ncountry. Cotton and woollen cloths are manufactured: blankets of various\r\ndimensions, manufactured by Cherokee hands, are very common. Almost\r\nevery family in the nation grows cotton for its own consumption.\r\nIndustry and commercial enterprise are extending themselves in every\r\npart. Nearly all the merchants in the nation are native Cherokees.\r\nAgricultural pursuits engage the chief attention of the people.\r\nDifferent branches in mechanics are pursued. The population is rapidly\r\nincreasing. *** White men in the nation enjoy all the immunities and\r\nprivileges of the Cherokee people, except that they are not eligible to\r\npublic offices. *** The Christian religion is the religion of the\r\nnation. Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, and Moravians are the most\r\nnumerous sects. Some of the most influential characters are members of\r\nthe Church, and live consistently with their professions. The whole\r\nnation is penetrated with gratitude for the aid it has received from the\r\nUnited States Government, and from different religious societies.\r\nSchools are increasing every year; learning is encouraged and rewarded;\r\nthe young class acquire the English, and those of mature age the\r\nCherokee system of learning. *** Our relations with all nations are of\r\nthe most friendly character. We are out of debt, and our public revenue\r\nis in a flourishing condition. Besides the amount arising from imports,\r\nperpetual annuity is due from the United States in consideration of\r\nlands ceded in former periods. Our system of government, founded on\r\nrepublican principles by which justice is equally distributed, secures\r\nthe respect of the people. New Town, pleasantly situated in the centre\r\nof the nation, and at the junction of the Canasagi and Gusuwati, two\r\nbeautiful streams, is the seat of government. The legislative power is\r\nvested in what is denominated in native dialect Tsalagi Tinilawige,\r\nconsisting of a national committee and council. Members of both branches\r\nare chosen by and from the people for a limited period. In New Town a\r\nprinting-press is soon to be established; also a national library and\r\nmuseum. An immense concourse of people frequent the seat of government\r\nwhen the Tsalagi Tinilawige is in session, which takes place once a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\"The success which has attended the philological researches of one in\r\nthe nation whose system of education has met with universal approbation\r\namong the Cherokees certainly entitles him to great consideration, and\r\nto rank with the benefactors of man. His name is Guess, and he is a\r\nnative and unlettered Cherokee; but, like Cadmus, he has given to his\r\npeople the alphabet of their language. It is composed of eighty-six\r\ncharacters, by which in a few days the older Indians, who had despaired\r\nof deriving an education by means of the schools, and who are not\r\nincluded in the existing school system, may read and correspond.\"[30]\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Art. IX.\r\n\r\nNever did mountaineers cling more desperately to their homes than did\r\nthe Cherokees. The State of Georgia put the whole nation in duress, but\r\nstill they chose to stay. Year by year high-handed oppressions increased\r\nand multiplied; military law reigned everywhere; Cherokee lands were\r\nsurveyed, and put up to be drawn by lottery; missionaries were arrested\r\nand sent to prison for preaching to Cherokees; Cherokees were sentenced\r\nto death by Georgia juries, and hung by Georgia executioners. Appeal\r\nafter appeal to the President and to Congress for protection produced\r\nonly reiterated confessions of the Government's inability to protect\r\nthem—reiterated proposals to them to accept a price for their country\r\nand move away. Nevertheless they clung to it. A few hundreds went, but\r\nthe body of the nation still protested and entreated. There is nothing\r\nin history more touching than the cries of this people to the Government\r\nof the United States to fulfil its promises to them. And their cause was\r\nnot without eloquent advocates. When the bill for their removal was\r\nbefore Congress, Frelinghuysen, Sprague, Robbins, Storrs, Ellsworth,\r\nEvans, Huntington, Johns, Bates, Crockett, Everett, Test—all spoke\r\nwarmly against it; and, to the credit of Congress be it said, the bill\r\npassed the Senate by only one majority.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Jeremiah Evarts published a series of papers in the _National\r\nIntelligencer_ under the signature of William Penn, in which he gave a\r\nmasterly analysis and summing up of the case, recapitulated the sixteen\r\ntreaties which the Government had made with the Cherokees, all\r\nguaranteeing to them their lands, and declared that the Government had\r\n\"arrived at the bank of the Rubicon,\" where it must decide if it would\r\nor would not save the country from the charge of bad faith. Many of his\r\neloquent sentences read in the light of the present time like\r\nprophecies. He says, \"in a quarter of a century the pressure upon the\r\nIndians will be much greater from the boundless prairies, which must\r\nultimately be subdued and inhabited, than it would ever have been from\r\nthe borders of the present Cherokee country;\" and asks, pertinently, \"to\r\nwhat confidence would such an engagement be entitled, done at the very\r\nmoment that treaties with Indians are declared not to be binding, and\r\nfor the very reason that existing treaties are not strong enough to bind\r\nthe United States.\" Remonstrances poured in upon Congress, petitions and\r\nmemorials from religious societies, from little country villages, all\r\nimploring the Government to keep its faith to these people.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees' own newspaper, _The Phœnix_, was filled at this time with\r\nthe records of the nation's suffering and despair.\r\n\r\n\"The State of Georgia has taken a strong stand against us, and the\r\nUnited States must either defend us and our rights or leave us to our\r\nfoe. In the latter case she will violate her promise of protection, and\r\nwe cannot in future depend upon any guarantee to us, either here or\r\nbeyond the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\"If the United States shall withdraw their solemn pledges of protection,\r\nutterly disregard their plighted faith, deprive us of the right of\r\nself-government, and wrest from us our land, then, in the deep anguish\r\nof our misfortunes, we may justly say there is no place of security for\r\nus, no confidence left that the United States will be more just and\r\nfaithful toward us in the barren prairies of the West than when we\r\noccupied the soil inherited from the Great Author of our existence.\"\r\n\r\nAs a last resort the Cherokees carried their case before the Supreme\r\nCourt, and implored that body to restrain the State of Georgia from her\r\nunjust interference with their rights. The reports of the case of the\r\nCherokee Nation _vs._ the State of Georgia fill a volume by themselves,\r\nand are of vital importance to the history of Indian affairs. The\r\nmajority of the judges decided that an Indian tribe could not be\r\nconsidered as a foreign nation, and therefore could not bring the suit.\r\nJudge Thompson and Judge Story dissented from this opinion, and held\r\nthat the Cherokee tribe did constitute a foreign nation, and that the\r\nState of Georgia ought to be enjoined from execution of its unjust laws.\r\nThe opinion of Chancellor Kent coincided with that of Judges Thompson\r\nand Story. Chancellor Kent gave it as his opinion that the cases in\r\nwhich the Supreme Court had jurisdiction would \"reach and embrace every\r\ncontroversy that can arise between the Cherokees and the State of\r\nGeorgia or its officers under the execution of the act of Georgia.\"\r\n\r\nBut all this did not help the Cherokees; neither did the fact of the\r\nmanifest sympathy of the whole court with their wrongs. The technical\r\nlegal decision had been rendered against them, and this delivered them\r\nover to the tender mercies of Georgia: no power in the land could help\r\nthem. Fierce factions now began to be formed in the nation, one for and\r\none against the surrender of their lands. Many were ready still to\r\nremain and suffer till death rather than give them up; but wiser\r\ncounsels prevailed, and in the last days of the year 1835 a treaty was\r\nconcluded with the United States by twenty of the Cherokee chiefs and\r\nheadmen, who thereby, in behalf of their nation, relinquished all the\r\nlands claimed or possessed by them east of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nThe preamble of this treaty is full of pathos: \"_Whereas_, The Cherokees\r\nare anxious to make some arrangement with the Government of the United\r\nStates whereby the difficulties they have experienced by a residence\r\nwithin the settled parts of the United States under the jurisdiction and\r\nlaws of the State governments may be terminated and adjusted; and with a\r\nview to reuniting their people in one body, and securing a permanent\r\nhome for themselves and their posterity in the country selected by their\r\nforefathers without the territorial limits of the State sovereignties,\r\nand where they can establish and enjoy a government of their choice, and\r\nperpetuate such a state of society as may be most consonant with their\r\nviews, habits, and condition, and as may tend to their individual\r\ncomfort and their advancement in civilization.\"\r\n\r\nBy this treaty the Cherokees gave up a country \"larger than the three\r\nStates of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut combined, and\r\nreceived therefor five millions of dollars and seven millions of acres\r\nof land west of the Mississippi.\" This the United States \"guaranteed,\r\nand secured to be conveyed in patent,\" and defined it by exact\r\nboundaries; and, \"in addition to the seven millions of acres of land\r\nthus provided for and bounded,\" the United States did \"further guarantee\r\nto the Cherokee nation a perpetual outlet west, and a free and\r\nunmolested use of all the country west of the western boundary of said\r\nseven millions of acres, as far west as the sovereignty of the United\r\nStates and their rights of soil extend.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifth Article of this treaty is, \"The United States hereby covenant\r\nand agree that the lands ceded to the Cherokee nation in the foregoing\r\narticle shall in no future time, without their consent, be included\r\nwithin the territorial limits or jurisdiction of any State or\r\nTerritory.\"\r\n\r\nIn the sixth Article is this promise: \"The United States agree to\r\nprotect the Cherokee nation from domestic strife and foreign enemies,\r\nand against intestine wars between the several tribes.\"\r\n\r\nEven after this treaty was made a great part of the nation refused to\r\nsanction it, saying that it did not represent their wish; they would\r\nnever carry it out; hundreds refused to receive any longer either money\r\nor supplies from the United States agents, lest they should be\r\nconsidered to have thereby committed themselves to the treaty.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 General Wool wrote from the Cherokee country that the people\r\n\"uniformly declare that they never made the treaty in question. *** So\r\ndetermined are they in their opposition that not one of all those who\r\nwere present, and voted in the council held but a day or two since at\r\nthis place, however poor or destitute, would receive either rations or\r\nclothing from the United States, lest they might compromise themselves\r\nin regard to the treaty. These same people, as well as those in the\r\nmountains of North Carolina, during the summer past preferred living on\r\nthe roots and sap of trees rather than receive provisions from the\r\nUnited States. Thousands, I have been informed, had no other food for\r\nweeks.\"\r\n\r\nFor two years—to the very last moment allowed them by the treaty—they\r\nclung to their lands, and at last were removed only by military force.\r\nIn May, 1838, General Scott was ordered to go with a sufficient military\r\nforce to compel the removal. His proclamation \"to the Cherokee people\r\nremaining in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama\" opens\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\"CHEROKEES,—The President of the United States has sent me with a\r\npowerful army to cause you, in obedience to the treaty of 1835, to join\r\nthat part of your people who are already established on the other side\r\nof the Mississippi. Unhappily the two years which were allowed for the\r\npurpose you have suffered to pass away without following, and without\r\nmaking any preparation to follow; and now, or by the time that this\r\nsolemn address shall reach your distant settlements, the emigration must\r\nbe commenced in haste, but I hope without disorder. I have no power, by\r\ngranting a further delay, to correct the error that you have committed.\r\nThe full-moon of May is already on the wane, and before another shall\r\nhave passed away every Cherokee man, woman, and child in those States\r\nmust be in motion to join their brethren in the West.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone of this proclamation, at once firm and kindly, could not fail\r\nto profoundly impress the unfortunate people to whom it was addressed.\r\n\"My troops,\" said the humane and sympathizing general, \"already occupy\r\nmany positions in the country that you are to abandon, and thousands and\r\nthousands are approaching from every quarter, to render resistance and\r\nescape alike hopeless. All those troops, regular and militia, are your\r\nfriends. Receive them and confide in them as such; obey them when they\r\ntell you that you can remain no longer in this country. Soldiers are as\r\nkind-hearted as brave, and the desire of every one of us is to execute\r\nour painful duty in mercy. ***\r\n\r\n\"Chiefs, headmen, and warriors, will you then, by resistance, compel us\r\nto resort to arms? God forbid. Or will you by flight seek to hide\r\nyourselves in mountains and forests, and thus oblige us to hunt you\r\ndown? Remember that in pursuit it may be impossible to avoid conflicts.\r\nThe blood of the white man or the blood of the red man may be spilt; and\r\nif spilt, however accidentally, it may be impossible for the discreet\r\nand humane among you or among us to prevent a general war and carnage.\r\nThink of this, my Cherokee brethren! I am an old warrior, and have been\r\npresent at many a scene of slaughter; but spare me, I beseech you, the\r\nhorror of witnessing the destruction of the Cherokees. Do not even wait\r\nfor the close approach of the troops, but make such preparations for\r\nemigration as you can, and hasten to this place, to Ross's Landing, or\r\nto Guinter's Landing, where you will be received in kindness by officers\r\nselected for the purpose. *** This is the address of a warrior to\r\nwarriors. May its entreaties be kindly received, and may the God of both\r\nprosper the Americans and Cherokees, and preserve them long in peace and\r\nfriendship with each other.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply of the council of the Cherokee nation to this proclamation is\r\nworthy to be put on record. They make no further protest against going;\r\nthey simply ask the privilege of undertaking the whole charge of the\r\nremoval themselves. They say: \"The present condition of the Cherokee\r\npeople is such that all dispute as to the time of emigration is set at\r\nrest. Being already severed from their homes and their property, their\r\npersons being under the absolute control of the commanding general, and\r\nbeing altogether dependent on the benevolence and humanity of that high\r\nofficer for the suspension of their transportation to the West at a\r\nseason and under circumstances in which sickness and death were to be\r\napprehended to an alarming extent, all inducements to prolong their stay\r\nin this country are taken away. And however strong their attachment to\r\nthe homes of their fathers may be, their interests and their wishes are\r\nnow to depart as early as may be consistent with their safety.\"\r\n\r\nThe council therefore submitted to General Scott several propositions:\r\n1st. \"That the Cherokee nation will undertake the whole business of\r\nremoving their people to the west of the river Mississippi.\" Their\r\nestimates of cost, and arrangement as to time, intervals, etc., were\r\nwise and reasonable. To their estimate of $65,880 as the cost for every\r\nthousand persons transported General Scott objected, thinking it high.\r\nHe said that he was \"confident\" that it would be found that out of every\r\nthousand there would be \"at least five hundred strong men, women, boys,\r\nand girls not only capable of marching twelve or fifteen miles a day,\r\nbut to whom the exercise would be beneficial; and another hundred able\r\nto go on foot half that distance daily.\" He also objected to the\r\nestimate of the ration at sixteen cents as too high.\r\n\r\nThe council replied that they believed the estimate reasonable, \"having\r\nthe comfortable removal of our people solely in view, and endeavoring to\r\nbe governed, as far as that object will allow, by the rates of\r\nexpenditure fixed by the officers of the Government. After the necessary\r\nbedding, cooking-utensils, and other indispensable articles of twenty\r\npersons—say, four or five families—are placed in a wagon, with\r\nsubsistence for at least two days, the weight already will be enough to\r\nexclude, in our opinion, more than a very few persons being hauled. The\r\ngreat distance to be travelled, liability to sickness on the way of\r\ngrown persons, and the desire of performing the trip in as short a time\r\nas possible, induce us still to think our estimate of that item not\r\nextravagant. *** Whatever may be necessary in the emigration of our\r\npeople to their comfort on the way, and as conducive to their health, we\r\ndesire to be afforded them; at the same time it is our anxious wish, in\r\nthe management of this business, to be free at all times from the\r\nimputation of extravagance.\" They added that the item of soap had been\r\nforgotten in their first estimate, and must now be included, at the rate\r\nof three pounds to every hundred pounds of rations.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott replied, \"as the Cherokee people are exclusively\r\ninterested in the cost as well as the comfort of the removal,\" he did\r\nnot feel himself at liberty to withhold his sanction from these\r\nestimates. In the report of the Indian Commissioner, also, it is stated\r\nthat \"the cost of removal, according to the Indian estimate, is high;\"\r\nbut the commissioner adds, \"as their own fund pays it, and it was\r\ninsisted on by their own confidential agents, it was thought it could\r\nnot be rejected.\"\r\n\r\nNoble liberality! This nation of eighteen thousand industrious,\r\nself-supporting people, compelled at the point of the bayonet to leave\r\ntheir country and seek new homes in a wilderness, are to be permitted,\r\nas a favor, to spend on their journey to this wilderness as much of\r\ntheir own money as they think necessary, and have all the soap they\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nThe record which the United States Government has left in official\r\npapers of its self-congratulations in the matter of this Cherokee\r\nremoval has an element in it of the ludicrous, spite of the tragedy and\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nSays the Secretary of War: \"The generous and enlightened policy evinced\r\nin the measures adopted by Congress toward that people during the last\r\nsession was ably and judiciously carried into effect by the general\r\nappointed to conduct their removal. The reluctance of the Indians to\r\nrelinquish the land of their birth in the East, and remove to their new\r\nhomes in the West, was entirely overcome by the judicious conduct of\r\nthat officer, and they departed with alacrity under the guidance of\r\ntheir own chiefs. The arrangements for this purpose made by General\r\nScott, in compliance with his previous instructions, although somewhat\r\ncostly to the Indians themselves, met the entire approbation of the\r\nDepartment, as it was deemed of the last importance that the Cherokees\r\nshould remove to the West voluntarily, and that upon their arrival at\r\nthe place of their ultimate destination they should recur to the manner\r\nin which they had been treated with kind and grateful feelings. Humanity\r\nno less than good policy dictated this course toward these children of\r\nthe forest; and in carrying out in this instance with an unwavering hand\r\nthe measures resolved upon by the Government, in the hope of preserving\r\nthe Indians and of maintaining the peace and tranquillity of the whites,\r\nit will always be gratifying to reflect that this has been effected not\r\nonly without violence, but with every proper regard for the feelings and\r\ninterests of that people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Indian Affairs says, in his report: \"The case of the\r\nCherokees is a striking example of the liberality of the Government in\r\nall its branches. *** A retrospect of the last eight months in reference\r\nto this numerous and more than ordinarily enlightened tribe cannot fail\r\nto be refreshing to well-constituted minds.\"\r\n\r\nA further appropriation had been asked by the Cherokee chiefs to meet\r\nthe expense of their removal (they not thinking $5,000,000 a very\r\nmunificent payment for a country as large as all Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, and Connecticut together), and Congress had passed a law giving\r\nthem $1147.67 more, and the commissioner says of this: \"When it is\r\nconsidered that by the treaty of December, 1835, the sum of $5,000,000\r\nwas stipulated to be paid them as the full value of their lands, after\r\nthat amount was declared by the Senate of the United States to be an\r\nample consideration for them, the spirit of this whole proceeding cannot\r\nbe too much admired. By some the measure may be regarded as just; by\r\nothers generous: it perhaps partook of both attributes. If it went\r\nfarther than naked justice could have demanded, it did not stop short of\r\nwhat liberality approved. *** If our acts have been generous, they have\r\nnot been less wise and politic. A large mass of men have been\r\nconciliated; the hazard of an effusion of human blood has been put by;\r\ngood feeling has been preserved, and we have quietly and gently\r\ntransported eighteen thousand friends to the west bank of the\r\nMississippi.\"\r\n\r\nTo dwell on the picture of this removal is needless. The fact by itself\r\nis more eloquent than pages of detail and description could make it. No\r\nimagination so dull, no heart so hard as not to see and to feel, at the\r\nbare mention of such an emigration, what horrors and what anguish it\r\nmust have involved. \"Eighteen thousand friends!\" Only a great\r\nmagnanimity of nature, strengthened by true Christian principle, could\r\nhave prevented them from being changed into eighteen thousand bitter\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nFor some years after this removal fierce dissensions rent the Cherokee\r\nnation. The party who held that the treaty of 1835 had been unfair, and\r\nthat the nation still had an unextinguished right to its old country at\r\nthe East, felt, as was natural, a bitter hatred toward the party which,\r\nthey claimed, had wrongfully signed away the nation's lands. Several of\r\nthe signers of the treaty, influential men of the nation, were murdered.\r\nParty-spirit ran to such a height that the United States Government was\r\ncompelled to interfere; and in 1846, after long negotiations and\r\ndissensions, a new treaty was made, by the terms and concessions of\r\nwhich the anti-treaty party were appeased, a general amnesty provided\r\nfor, and comparative harmony restored to the nation.\r\n\r\nThe progress of this people in the ten years following this removal is\r\nalmost past belief. In 1851 they had twenty-two primary schools, and had\r\njust built two large houses for a male and female seminary, in which the\r\nhigher branches of education were to be taught. They had a temperance\r\nsociety with three thousand members, and an auxiliary society in each of\r\nthe eight districts into which the country was divided. They had a Bible\r\nSociety and twelve churches; a weekly newspaper, partly in English,\r\npartly in Cherokee; eight district courts, two circuit courts, and a\r\nsupreme court. Legislative business was transacted as before by the\r\nnational council and committee, elected for four years. Nearly one\r\nthousand boys and girls were in the public schools.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the agitation on the subject of slavery began to be felt, a\r\nstrong antislavery party being organized in the nation. There were\r\nstormy scenes also in that part of the country nearest the Kansas line.\r\nFor several years white settlers had persisted in taking up farms there,\r\nand the Cherokees had in vain implored the Government to drive them\r\naway. The officer at last sent to enforce the Cherokees' rights and\r\ndislodge the squatters was obliged to burn their cabins over their heads\r\nbefore they would stir, so persuaded were they of the superior right of\r\nthe white man over the Indian. \"The only reason the settlers gave for\r\nnot heeding the notices was that they had been often notified before to\r\nquit the reservation; and, no steps having been taken to enforce\r\nobedience, they supposed they would be allowed to remain with like\r\nsecurity in this instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is surprising,\" says the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, \"to see the\r\ngrowing disposition on the part of our citizens to wholly disregard our\r\ntreaty obligations with Indian tribes within our borders; and it is to\r\nbe hoped that in future their rights will be held more sacred, or that\r\nthe Government will in every instance promptly see that they are\r\nobserved and respected.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the Civil War a large number of the Cherokees took\r\nup arms on the rebel side. That this was not from any love or liking for\r\nthe Southern cause, it would seem, must be evident to any one who\r\nbelieved that they were possessed of memories. The opportunity of\r\nfighting against Georgians could not but have been welcome to the soul\r\nof a Cherokee, even if he bought it at the price of fighting on the side\r\nof the government which had been so perfidious to his nation. Their\r\ndefection was no doubt largely due to terror. The forts in their\r\nvicinity were surrendered to the rebels; all United States troops were\r\nwithdrawn from that part of the country. They had no prospect of\r\nprotection from the Government, and, as if to leave them without one\r\nincentive to loyalty, the Government suspended the payment of their\r\nannuities.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate Government stepped in, artfully promising to pay what\r\nthe Northern Government refused. It would have taken a rare loyalty,\r\nindeed, to have stood unmoved in such circumstances as these; yet\r\nthousands of the Indians in Indian Territory did remain loyal, and fled\r\nfor their lives to avoid being pressed into the rebel service; almost\r\nhalf of the Creek nation, many Seminoles, Chickasaws, Quapaws,\r\nCherokees, and half a dozen others—over six thousand in all—fled to\r\nKansas, where their sufferings in the winter of 1862 were heart-rending.\r\n\r\nThat the Cherokees did not lightly abandon their allegiance is on record\r\nin the official history of the Department of the Interior. The Report of\r\nthe Indian Bureau for 1863 says: \"The Cherokees, prior to the Rebellion,\r\nwere the most numerous, intelligent, wealthy, and influential tribe of\r\nthis superintendency (the southern). For many months they steadily\r\nresisted the efforts made by the rebels to induce them to abandon their\r\nallegiance to the Federal Government; but being wholly unprotected, and\r\nwithout the means of resistance, they were finally compelled to enter\r\ninto treaty stipulations with the rebel authorities. This connection\r\nwas, however, of short duration, for upon the first appearance of United\r\nStates forces in their country an entire regiment of Indian troops,\r\nraised ostensibly for service in the rebel army, deserted and came over\r\nto us, and have ever since been under our command, and upon all\r\noccasions have proved themselves faithful and efficient soldiers.\" In\r\nthe course of the next year, however, many more joined the rebels: it\r\nwas estimated that between six and seven thousand of the wealthier\r\nportion of the nation co-operated in one way or another with the rebels.\r\nThe result was that at the end of the war the Cherokee country was\r\nruined.\r\n\r\n\"In the Cherokee country,\" says the Report of the Indian Bureau for\r\n1865, \"where the contending armies have moved to and fro; where their\r\nforaging parties have gone at will, sparing neither friend nor foe;\r\nwhere the disloyal Cherokees in the service of the rebel government were\r\ndetermined that no trace of the homesteads of their loyal brethren\r\nshould remain for their return; and where the swindling cattle-thieves\r\nhave made their ill-gotten gains for two years past, the scene is one of\r\nutter desolation.\"\r\n\r\nThe party feeling between the loyal and disloyal Cherokees ran as high\r\nas it did between the loyal and disloyal whites, and it looked for a\r\ntime as if it would be as impossible to make the two opposing parties in\r\nthe Cherokee nation agree to live peaceably side by side with each\r\nother, as it would to make discharged soldiers from Georgia and from\r\nMaine settle down in one village together. But after long and\r\ntroublesome negotiations a treaty was concluded in 1866, by which all\r\nthe necessary points seemed to be established of a general amnesty and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThat the Indians were at a great disadvantage in the making of these new\r\ntreaties it is unnecessary to state. The peculiarity of the Government's\r\nview of their situation and rights is most näively stated in one of the\r\nreports for 1862. Alluding to the necessity of making at no very distant\r\ntime new treaties with all these Southern tribes, one of the Indian\r\nsuperintendents says: \"While the rebelling of a large portion of most of\r\nthese tribes abrogates treaty obligations, and places them at our mercy,\r\nthe very important fact should not be forgotten that the Government\r\nfirst wholly failed to keep its treaty stipulations with those people,\r\nand in protecting them, by withdrawing all the troops from the forts in\r\nIndian Territory, and leaving them at the mercy of the rebels. It is a\r\nwell-known fact that self-preservation in many instances compelled them\r\nto make the best terms they could with the rebels.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless they are \"at our mercy,\" because their making the \"best\r\nterms they could with the rebels abrogates treaty obligations.\" The\r\ntrite old proverb about the poorness of rules that do not work both ways\r\nseems to be applicable here.\r\n\r\nWith a recuperative power far in advance of that shown by any of the\r\nsmall white communities at the South, the Cherokees at once addressed\r\nthemselves to rebuilding their homes and reconstructing their national\r\nlife. In one year they established fifteen new schools, set all their\r\nold industries going, and in 1869 held a large agricultural fair, which\r\ngave a creditable exhibition of stock and farm produce. Thus a second\r\ntime they recovered themselves, after what would seem to be well-nigh\r\ntheir destruction as a people. But the Indian's fate of perpetual\r\ninsecurity, alarm, and unrest does not abandon them. In 1870 they are\r\nsaid to be \"extremely uneasy about the security of their possession of\r\nthe lands they occupy.\" When asked why their high-schools are not\r\nre-established, reforms introduced into the administration of justice,\r\ndesirable improvements undertaken, the reply inevitably comes, \"We\r\nexpect to have our lands taken away: what is the use of all that when\r\nour doom as a nation is sealed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Distrust is firmly seated in their minds. National apathy depresses\r\nthem, and until they realize a feeling of assurance that their title to\r\ntheir lands will be respected, and that treaties are an inviolable law\r\nfor all parties, the Cherokees will not make the efforts for national\r\nprogress of which they are capable.\"\r\n\r\nWhen their delegates went to Washington, in 1866, to make the new\r\ntreaty, they were alarmed by the position taken by the Government that\r\nthe nation, as a nation, had forfeited its rights. They were given to\r\nunderstand that \"public opinion held them responsible for complicity in\r\nthe Rebellion; and, although they could point to the fact that the only\r\ncountenance the rebels received came from less than one-third of the\r\npopulation, and cite the services of two Cherokee regiments in the Union\r\ncause, it was urged home to them that, before being rehabilitated in\r\ntheir former rights by a new treaty, they were not in a position to\r\nrefuse any conditions imposed. Such language from persons they believed\r\nto possess the power of injuring their people intimidated the Cherokee\r\ndelegates. They sold a large tract in South-eastern Kansas at a dollar\r\nan acre to an association of speculators, and it went into the\r\npossession of a railroad company. They also acceded, against the wishes\r\nof the Cherokee people, to a provision in the treaty granting right of\r\nway through the country for two railroads. This excited great uneasiness\r\namong the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nAnd well it might. The events of the next few years amply justified this\r\nuneasiness. The rapacity of railroad corporations is as insatiable as\r\ntheir methods are unscrupulous. The phrase \"extinguishing Indian titles\"\r\nhas become, as it were, a mere technical term in the transfer of lands.\r\nThe expression is so common that it has probably been one of the\r\nagencies in fixing in the minds of the people the prevalent impression\r\nthat extinction is the ultimate and inevitable fate of the Indian; and\r\nthis being the case, methods and times are not, after all, of so much\r\nconsequence; they are merely foreordained conditions of the great\r\nforeordained progression of events. This is the only explanation of the\r\nunconscious inhumanity of many good men's modes of thinking and speaking\r\nin regard to the Indians being driven from home after home, and robbed\r\nof tract after tract of their lands.\r\n\r\nIn the Report of the Indian Bureau for 1875 is an account of a remnant\r\nof the Cherokee tribe in North Carolina: \"They number not far from\r\nseventeen hundred, and there are probably in other parts of North\r\nCarolina, and scattered through Georgia and Tennessee, between three and\r\nfour hundred more. These Cherokees have had an eventful history. When\r\nthe main portion of the tribe was compelled to remove west of the\r\nMississippi they fled to the mountains, and have steadily refused to\r\nleave their homes. The proceeds of their lands, which were sold in\r\naccordance with a treaty with the main body of the Cherokees, have been\r\nmainly expended in the purchase of lands, and providing funds for the\r\nWestern Cherokees. At various times previous to the year 1861 the agent\r\nfor the Eastern Cherokees, at their request, purchased lands with their\r\nfunds, upon which they might make their homes. These purchases, though\r\nprobably made with good intent, carelessly left the title in their agent\r\npersonally, and not in trust. By this neglect, when subsequently the\r\nagent became insolvent, all their lands were seized and sold for his\r\ndebts. By special legislation of Congress their case has been brought\r\nbefore the courts of North Carolina, and their rights to a certain\r\nextent asserted, and they are enabled to maintain possession of their\r\nlands; and, by the use of their own funds in extinguishing liens, are\r\nnow in possession of above seventy thousand acres of fair arable,\r\ntimber, and grazing lands. They have shown themselves capable of\r\nself-support, and, I believe, have demonstrated the unwisdom of removing\r\nIndians from a country which offers to them a home, and where a white\r\nman could make a living. This is shown by the fact that they are now,\r\nthough receiving scarcely any Government aid, in a more hopeful\r\ncondition, both as to morals, and industry, and personal property, than\r\nthe Cherokees who removed West.\"\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Indian Bureau for 1876 fully bears out this statement.\r\nThe North Carolina Cherokees have, indeed, reason to be in a more\r\nhopeful condition, for they have their lands secured to them by patent,\r\nconfirmed by a decision of State courts; but this is what the Department\r\nof the Interior has brought itself to say as to the Western Cherokees'\r\nlands, and those of all other civilized tribes in the Indian Territory:\r\n\"By treaty the Government has ceded to the so-called civilized\r\ntribes—the Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Seminoles—a\r\nsection of country altogether disproportionate in amount to their needs.\r\n*** The amount susceptible of cultivation must be many-fold greater than\r\ncan ever be cultivated by the labor of the Indians. But the Indians\r\nclaim, it is understood, that they hold their lands by sanctions so\r\nsolemn that it would be a gross breach of faith on the part of the\r\nGovernment to take away any portion thereof without their consent; and\r\nthat consent they apparently propose to withhold.\"\r\n\r\nLet us set side by side with this last paragraph a quotation from the\r\ntreaty by virtue of which \"the Indians claim, it is understood, that\r\nthey hold\" these lands, which they now \"apparently propose to withhold.\"\r\nWe will not copy it from the original treaty; we will copy it, and a few\r\nother sentences with it, from an earlier report of this same Department\r\nof the Interior. Only so far back as 1870 we find the Department in a\r\njuster frame of mind toward the Cherokees. \"A large part of the Indian\r\ntribes hold lands to which they are only fixed by laws that define the\r\nreservations to which they shall be confined. It cannot be denied that\r\nthese are in a great measure dependent on the humanity of the American\r\npeople. *** But the Cherokees, and the other civilized Indian nations no\r\nless, hold lands in perpetuity by titles defined by the supreme law of\r\nthe land. The United States agreed 'to possess the Cherokees, and to\r\nguarantee it to them forever,' and that guarantee 'was solemnly pledged\r\nof seven million acres of land.' The consideration for this territory\r\nwas the same number of acres elsewhere located. The inducement to the\r\nbargain set forth in the treaty was 'the anxious desire of the\r\nGovernment of the United States to secure to the Cherokee nation of\r\nIndians a permanent home, and which shall, under the most solemn\r\nguarantee of the United States, be and remain theirs forever—a home that\r\nshall never in all future time be embarrassed by having extended around\r\nit the lines or placed over it the jurisdiction of a Territory or State,\r\nor be pressed upon by the extension in any way of the limits of any\r\nexisting State.' To assure them of their title, a patent for the\r\nTerritory was issued.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the view of the Department of the Interior in 1870. In 1876 the\r\nDepartment says that affairs in the Indian Territory are \"complicated\r\nand embarrassing, and the question is directly raised whether an\r\nextensive section of country is to be allowed to remain for an\r\nindefinite period practically an uncultivated waste, or whether the\r\nGovernment shall determine to reduce the size of the reservation.\"\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"whether the Government shall determine to reduce the size of\r\nthe reservation\" sounds much better than \"whether the Government shall\r\nrob the Indians of a few millions of acres of land;\" but the latter\r\nphrase is truth, and the other is the spirit of lying.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner says that the question is a difficult one, and should\r\nbe \"considered with calmness, and a full purpose to do no injustice to\r\nthe Indians.\" He gives his own personal opinion on it \"with hesitancy,\"\r\nbut gives it nevertheless, that \"public policy will soon require the\r\ndisposal of a large portion of these lands to the Government for the\r\noccupancy either of other tribes of Indians or of white people. There is\r\na very general and growing opinion that observance of the strict letter\r\nof treaties with Indians is in many cases at variance with their own\r\nbest interests and with sound public policy.\" He adds, however, that it\r\nmust not be understood from this recommendation that it is \"the policy\r\nor purpose of this office to in any way encourage the spirit of rapacity\r\nwhich demands the throwing open of the Indian Territory to white\r\nsettlement.\" He says, \"the true way to secure its perpetual occupancy by\r\nIndians is to fill it up with other Indians, to give them lands in\r\nseveralty, and to provide a government strong and intelligent enough to\r\nprotect them effectually from any and all encroachments on the part of\r\nthe whites.\"\r\n\r\nComment on these preposterously contradictory sentences would be idle.\r\nThe best comment on them, and the most fitting close to this sketch of\r\nthe Cherokee nation, is in a few more quotations from the official\r\nreports of the Indian Bureau.\r\n\r\nOf this people, from whom the Department of the Interior proposes, for\r\n\"public policy,\" to take away \"a large portion\" of their country, it has\r\npublished within the last three years these records:\r\n\r\n\"It has been but a few years since the Cherokees assembled in council\r\nunder trees or in a rude log-house, with hewed logs for seats. Now the\r\nlegislature assembles in a spacious brick council-house, provided with\r\nsuitable committee-rooms, senate chamber, representative hall, library,\r\nand executive offices, which cost $22,000.\r\n\r\n\"Their citizens occupy neat hewed double log-cabins, frame, brick, or\r\nstone houses, according to the means or taste of the individual, with\r\nground adorned by ornamental trees, shrubbery, flowers, and nearly every\r\nimprovement, including orchards of the choicest fruits. Some of these\r\norchards have existed for nearly twenty years, and are now in a good,\r\nfruitful condition. Their women are usually good house-keepers, and give\r\ngreat attention to spinning and weaving yarns, jeans, and linsey, and\r\nmake most of the pants and hunter-jackets of the men and boys. The\r\nfarmers raise most of their own wool and cotton, and it is not an\r\nuncommon sight, in a well-to-do Cherokee farmer's house, to see a\r\nsewing-machine and a piano.\r\n\r\n\"They have ample provision for the education of all their children to a\r\ndegree of advancement equal to that furnished by an ordinary college in\r\nthe States. They have seventy-five common day-schools, kept open ten\r\nmonths in the year, in the different settlements. For the higher\r\neducation of their young men and women they have two commodious and\r\nwell-furnished seminaries, one for each sex; and, in addition to those\r\nalready mentioned, they have a manual labor school and an orphan asylum.\r\nThe cost of maintaining these schools the past year (1877) was, as\r\nreported by the superintendent of public instruction, $73,441.65, of\r\nwhich $41,475 was paid as salary to teachers.\r\n\r\n\"They have twenty-four stores, twenty-two mills, and sixty-five\r\nsmith-shops, owned and conducted by their own citizens.\r\n\r\n\"Their constitution and laws are published in book form; and from their\r\nprinting-house goes forth among the people in their own language, and\r\nalso in English, the _Cherokee Advocate_, a weekly paper, which is\r\nedited with taste and ability.\r\n\r\n\"They have (and this is true also of the Choctaws, Creeks, Chickasaws,\r\nand Seminoles) a constitutional government, with legislative, judicial,\r\nand executive departments, and conducted upon the same plan as our State\r\ngovernments, the entire expenses of which are paid out of their own\r\nfunds, which are derived from interest on various stocks and bonds—the\r\ninvested proceeds of the sale of their lands, and held in trust by the\r\nGovernment of the United States—which interest is paid the treasurers of\r\nthe different nations semi-annually, and by them disbursed on national\r\nwarrants issued by the principal chief and secretary, and registered by\r\nthe auditors.\r\n\r\n\"They are an intelligent, temperate, and industrious people, who live by\r\nthe honest fruits of their labor, and seem ambitious to advance both as\r\nto the development of their lands and the conveniences of their homes.\r\nIn their council may be found men of learning and ability; and it is\r\ndoubtful if their rapid progress from a state of wild barbarism to that\r\nof civilization and enlightenment has any parallel in the history of the\r\nworld. What required five hundred years for the Britons to accomplish in\r\nthis direction they have accomplished in one hundred years.\"\r\n\r\nWill the United States Government determine to \"reduce the size of the\r\nreservation?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                    MASSACRES OF INDIANS BY WHITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.—_The Conestoga Massacre._\r\n\r\nWhen the English first entered Pennsylvania messengers from the\r\nConestoga Indians met them, bidding them welcome, and bringing gifts of\r\ncorn and venison and skins. The whole tribe entered into a treaty of\r\nfriendship with William Penn, which was to last \"as long as the sun\r\nshould shine or the waters run into the rivers.\"\r\n\r\nThe records of Pennsylvania history in the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury contain frequent mention of the tribe. In 1705 the governor sent\r\nthe secretary of his council, with a delegation of ten men, to hold an\r\ninterview with them at Conestoga, for purposes of mutual understanding\r\nand confidence. And in that same year Thomas Chalkley, a famous Quaker\r\npreacher, while sojourning among the Maryland Quakers, was suddenly\r\nseized with so great a \"concern\" to visit these Indians that he laid the\r\nmatter before the elders at the Nottingham meeting; and, the idea being\r\n\"promoted\" by the elders, he set off with an interpreter and a party of\r\nfourteen to make the journey. He says: \"We travelled through the woods\r\nabout fifty miles, carrying our provisions with us; and on the journey\r\nsat down by a river and spread our food on the grass, and refreshed\r\nourselves and horses, and then went on cheerfully and with good-will and\r\nmuch love to the poor Indians. And when we came they received us kindly,\r\ntreating us civilly in their way. We treated about having a meeting with\r\nthem in a religious way; upon which they called a council, in which they\r\nwere very grave, and spoke, one after another, without any heat or\r\njarring. Some of the most esteemed of their women speak in their\r\ncouncils.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked why they suffered the women to speak, they replied that \"some\r\nwomen were wiser than some men.\" It was said that they had not for many\r\nyears done anything without the advice of a certain aged and grave\r\nwoman, who was always present at their councils. The interpreter said\r\nthat she was an empress, and that they gave much heed to what she said.\r\nThis wise queen of Conestoga looked with great favor on the Quakers, the\r\ninterpreter said, because they \"did not come to buy or sell, or get\r\ngain;\" but came \"in love and respect\" to them, \"and desired their\r\nwell-doing, both here and hereafter.\" Two nations at this time were\r\nrepresented in this Conestoga band—the Senecas and the Shawanese.\r\n\r\nThe next year the governor himself, anxious to preserve their\r\ninalienable good-will, and to prevent their being seduced by emissaries\r\nfrom the French, went himself to visit them. On this occasion one of the\r\nchiefs made a speech, still preserved in the old records, which contains\r\nthis passage: \"Father, we love quiet; we suffer the mouse to play; when\r\nthe woods are rustled by the wind, we fear not; when the leaves are\r\ndisturbed in ambush, we are uneasy; when a cloud obscures your brilliant\r\nsun, our eyes feel dim; but when the rays appear, they give great heat\r\nto the body and joy to the heart. Treachery darkens the chain of\r\nfriendship; but truth makes it brighter than ever. This is the peace we\r\ndesire.\"\r\n\r\nA few years later a Swedish missionary visited them, and preached them a\r\nsermon on original sin and the necessity of a mediator. When he had\r\nfinished, an Indian chief rose and replied to him; both discourses being\r\ngiven through an interpreter. The Swede is said to have been so\r\nimpressed with the Indian's reasoning that, after returning to Sweden,\r\nhe wrote out his own sermon and the Indian's reply in the best Latin at\r\nhis command, and dedicated the documents to the University of Upsal,\r\nrespectfully requesting them to furnish him with some arguments strong\r\nenough to confute the strong reasonings of this savage.\r\n\r\n\"Our forefathers,\" said the chief, \"were under a strong persuasion (as\r\nwe are) that those who act well in this life will be rewarded in the\r\nnext according to the degrees of their virtues; and, on the other hand,\r\nthat those who behave wickedly here will undergo such punishments\r\nhereafter as were proportionate to the crimes they were guilty of. This\r\nhas been constantly and invariably received and acknowledged for a truth\r\nthrough every successive generation of our ancestors. It could not,\r\nthen, have taken its rise from fable; for human fiction, however\r\nartfully and plausibly contrived, can never gain credit long among\r\npeople where free inquiry is allowed, which was never denied by our\r\nancestors. *** Now we desire to propose some questions. Does he believe\r\nthat our forefathers, men eminent for their piety, constant and warm in\r\ntheir pursuit of virtue, hoping thereby to merit eternal happiness, were\r\nall damned? Does he think that we who are zealous imitators in good\r\nworks, and influenced by the same motives as we are, earnestly\r\nendeavoring with the greatest circumspection to tread the path of\r\nintegrity, are in a state of damnation? If that be his sentiment, it is\r\nsurely as impious as it is bold and daring. *** Let us suppose that some\r\nheinous crimes were committed by some of our ancestors, like to that we\r\nare told of another race of people. In such a case God would certainly\r\npunish the criminal, but would never involve us that are innocent in the\r\nguilt. Those who think otherwise must make the Almighty a very\r\nwhimsical, evil-natured being. *** Once more: are the Christians more\r\nvirtuous, or, rather, are they not more vicious than we are? If so, how\r\ncame it to pass that they are the objects of God's beneficence, while we\r\nare neglected? Does he daily confer his favors without reason and with\r\nso much partiality? In a word, we find the Christians much more depraved\r\nin their morals than we are; and we judge from their doctrine by the\r\nbadness of their lives.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain that this Indian chief's speech was very much Latinized in\r\nthe good Swede's hands; but if the words even approached being a true\r\npresentation of what he said, it is wonderful indeed.\r\n\r\nIn 1721 His Excellency Sir William Keith, Bart., Governor of the\r\nProvince of Pennsylvania, went with an escort of eighty horsemen to\r\nConestoga, and spent several days in making a treaty with the\r\nrepresentatives of the Five Nations, \"the Indians of Conestoga and their\r\nfriends.\" He was entertained at \"Captain Civility's cabin.\" When he left\r\nthem, he desired them to give his \"very kind love and the love of all\r\nour people to your kings and to all their people.\" He invited them to\r\nvisit him in Philadelphia, saying, \"We can provide better for you and\r\nmake you more welcome. People always receive their friends best at their\r\nown homes.\" He then took out a coronation medal of the King, and\r\npresented it to the Indian in these words: \"That our children when we\r\nare dead may not forget these things, but keep this treaty between us in\r\nperpetual remembrance, I here deliver to you a picture in gold, bearing\r\nthe image of my great master, the King of all the English. And when you\r\nreturn home, I charge you to deliver this piece into the hands of the\r\nfirst man or greatest chief of all the Five Nations, whom you call\r\nKannygoodk, to be laid up and kept as a token to our children's children\r\nthat an entire and lasting friendship is now established forever between\r\nthe English in this country and the great Five Nations.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time the village of Conestoga was described as lying \"about\r\nseventy miles west of Philadelphia. The land thereabout being exceeding\r\nrich, it is now surrounded with divers fine plantations and farms, where\r\nthey raise quantities of wheat, barley, flax, and hemp, without the help\r\nof any dung.\"\r\n\r\nThe next year, also, was marked by a council of great significance at\r\nConestoga. In the spring of this year an Indian called Saanteenee had\r\nbeen killed by two white men, brothers, named Cartledge. At this time it\r\nwas not only politic but necessary for the English to keep on good terms\r\nwith as many Indians as possible. Therefore, the old record says,\r\n\"Policy and justice required a rigid inquiry\" into this affair, and the\r\ninfliction of \"exemplary punishment.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Cartledges were arrested and confined in Philadelphia,\r\nand the high-sheriff of Chester County went, with two influential men of\r\nthe province, to Conestoga, to confer with the Indians as to what should\r\nbe done with them. The Indians were unwilling to decide the matter\r\nwithout advice from the Five Nations, to whom they owed allegiance. A\r\nswift runner (Satcheecho) was, therefore, sent northward with the news\r\nof the occurrence; and the governor, with two of his council, went to\r\nAlbany to hear what the Five Nations had to say about it. What an\r\ninconceivable spectacle to us to-day: the governments of Pennsylvania\r\nand New York so fully recognizing an Indian to be a \"person,\" and his\r\nmurder a thing to be anxiously and swiftly atoned for if possible!\r\n\r\nOnly a little more than a hundred and fifty years lie between this\r\nmurder of Saanteenee in Conestoga and the murder of Big Snake on the\r\nPonca Reservation in 1880. Verily, Policy has kept a large assortment of\r\nspectacles for Justice to look through in a surprising short space of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOn the decision of the king and chiefs of the Five Nations hung the fate\r\nof the murderers. Doubtless the brothers Cartledge made up their minds\r\nto die. The known principles of the Indians in the matter of avenging\r\ninjuries certainly left them little room for hope. But no! The Five\r\nNations took a different view. They \"desired that the Cartledges should\r\nnot suffer death, and the affair was at length amicably settled,\" says\r\nthe old record. \"One life,\" said the Indian king, \"on this occasion, is\r\nenough to be lost. There should not two die.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in 1722. In 1763 there were only twenty of these Conestoga\r\nIndians left—seven men, five women, and eight children. They were still\r\nliving in their village on the Shawanee Creek, their lands being assured\r\nto them by manorial gift; but they were miserably poor—earned by making\r\nbrooms, baskets, and wooden bowls a part of their living, and begged the\r\nrest. They were wholly peaceable and unoffending, friendly to their\r\nwhite neighbors, and pitifully clinging and affectionate, naming their\r\nchildren after whites who were kind to them, and striving in every way\r\nto show their gratitude and good-will.\r\n\r\nUpon this little community a band of white men, said by some of the old\r\nrecords to be \"Presbyterians,\" from Paxton, made an attack at daybreak\r\non the 14th of December. They found only six of the Indians at\r\nhome—three men, two women, and a boy. The rest were away, either at work\r\nfor the white farmers or selling their little wares. \"These poor\r\ndefenceless creatures were immediately fired upon, stabbed, and\r\nhatcheted to death; the good Shebaes, among the rest, cut to pieces in\r\nhis bed. All of them were scalped and otherwise horribly mangled, then\r\ntheir huts were set on fire, and most of them burnt down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shebaes was a very old man, having assisted at the second treaty held\r\nwith Mr. Penn, in 1701, and ever since continued a faithful friend to\r\nthe English. He is said to have been an exceeding good man, considering\r\nhis education; being naturally of a most kind, benevolent temper.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a manuscript journal kept at this time, and belonging to the\r\ngreat-granddaughter of Robert Barber, the first settler in Lancaster\r\nCounty, are gathered the few details known of this massacre. \"Some of\r\nthe murderers went directly from the scene of their crime to Mr.\r\nBarber's house. They were strangers to him; but, with the hospitality of\r\nthose days, he made a fire for them and set refreshments before them.\r\n\r\n\"While they warmed themselves they inquired why the Indians were\r\nsuffered to live peaceably here. Mr. Barber said they were entirely\r\ninoffensive, living on their own lands and injuring no one. They asked\r\nwhat would be the consequence if they were all destroyed. Mr. Barber\r\nsaid he thought they would be as liable to punishment as if they had\r\ndestroyed so many white men. They said _they_ were of a different\r\nopinion, and in a few minutes went out. In the mean time two sons of Mr.\r\nBarber's, about ten or twelve years old, went out to look at the\r\nstrangers' horses, which were hitched at a little distance from the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"After the men went the boys came in, and said that they had tomahawks\r\ntied to their saddles which were all bloody, and that they had Christy's\r\ngun. Christy was a little Indian boy about their own age. They were much\r\nattached to him, as he was their playmate, and made bows and arrows for\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the family were talking over this, and wondering what it could\r\nmean, a messenger came running breathless to inform them of what had\r\nhappened. Mr. Barber went at once to the spot, and there he found the\r\nmurdered Indians lying in the smouldering ruins of their homes, \"like\r\nhalf-consumed logs.\" He, \"with some trouble, procured their bodies, to\r\nadminister to them the rights of sepulture.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was said that at the beginning of the slaughter an Indian mother\r\nplaced her little child under a barrel, charging it to make no noise,\r\nand that a shot was fired through the barrel which broke the child's\r\narm, and still it kept silent.\"\r\n\r\nThe magistrates of Lancaster, shocked, as well they might be, at this\r\nfrightful barbarity, sent messengers out immediately, and took the\r\nremaining Indians, wherever they were found, brought them into the town\r\nfor protection, and lodged them in the newly-erected workhouse or jail,\r\nwhich was the strongest building in the place. The Governor of\r\nPennsylvania issued a proclamation, ordering all judges, sheriffs, and\r\n\"all His Majesty's liege subjects in the province,\" to make every effort\r\nto apprehend the authors and perpetrators of this crime, also their\r\nabettors and accomplices. But the \"Paxton Boys\" held magistrates and\r\ngovernor alike in derision. Two weeks later they assembled again, fifty\r\nstrong, rode to Lancaster, dismounted, broke open the doors of the jail,\r\nand killed every Indian there.\r\n\r\n\"When the poor wretches saw they had no protection nigh, nor could\r\npossibly escape, and being without the least weapon of defence, they\r\ndivided their little families, the children clinging to their parents.\r\nThey fell on their faces, protested their innocence, declared their love\r\nto the English, and that in their whole lives they had never done them\r\ninjury. And in this posture they all received the hatchet. Men, women,\r\nand children were every one inhumanly murdered in cold blood. *** The\r\nbarbarous men who committed the atrocious act, in defiance of\r\ngovernment, of all laws, human and divine, and to the eternal disgrace\r\nof their country and color, then mounted their horses, huzzaed in\r\ntriumph, as if they had gained a victory, and rode off unmolested. ***\r\nThe bodies of the murdered were then brought out and exposed in the\r\nstreet till a hole could be made in the earth to receive and cover them.\r\nBut the wickedness cannot be covered, and the guilt will lie on the\r\nwhole land till justice is done on the murderers. The blood of the\r\ninnocent will cry to Heaven for vengeance.\"\r\n\r\nThese last extracts are from a pamphlet printed in Philadelphia at the\r\ntime of the massacre; printed anonymously, because \"so much had fear\r\nseized the minds of the people\" that neither the writer nor the printer\r\ndared to give \"name or place of abode.\"\r\n\r\nThere are also private letters still preserved which give accounts of\r\nthe affair. A part of one from William Henry, of Lancaster, to a friend\r\nin Philadelphia, is given in \"Rupp's History of Lancaster County.\" He\r\nsays, \"A regiment of Highlanders were at that time quartered at the\r\nbarracks in the town, and yet these murderers were permitted to break\r\nopen the doors of the city jail and commit the horrid deed. The first\r\nnotice I had of the affair was that, while at my father's store near the\r\ncourt-house, I saw a number of people running down-street toward the\r\njail, which enticed me and other lads to follow them. At about six or\r\neight yards from the jail we met from twenty-five to thirty men, well\r\nmounted on horses, and with rifles, tomahawks, and scalping-knives,\r\nequipped for murder. I ran into the prison-yard, and there, oh, what a\r\nhorrid sight presented itself to my view! Near the back door of the\r\nprison lay an old Indian and his squaw, particularly well known and\r\nesteemed by the people of the town on account of his placid and friendly\r\nconduct. His name was Will Soc. Around him and his squaw lay two\r\nchildren, about the age of three years, whose heads were split with the\r\ntomahawk and their scalps taken off. Toward the middle of the jail-yard,\r\nalong the west side of the wall, lay a stout Indian, whom I particularly\r\nnoticed to have been shot in his breast. His legs were chopped with the\r\ntomahawk, his hands cut off, and finally a rifle-ball discharged in his\r\nmouth, so that his head was blown to atoms, and the brains were splashed\r\nagainst and yet hanging to the wall for three or four feet around. This\r\nman's hands and feet had been chopped off with a tomahawk. In this\r\nmanner lay the whole of them—men, women, and children—spread about the\r\nprison-yard, shot, scalped, hacked, and cut to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a second proclamation,\r\nstill more stringent than the first, and offering a reward of $600 for\r\nthe apprehension of any three of the ringleaders.\r\n\r\nBut the \"Paxton Boys\" were now like wild beasts that had tasted blood.\r\nThey threatened to attack the Quakers and all persons who sympathized\r\nwith or protected Indians. They openly mocked and derided the governor\r\nand his proclamations, and set off at once for Philadelphia, announcing\r\ntheir intention of killing all the Moravian Indians who had been placed\r\nunder the protection of the military there.\r\n\r\nTheir march through the country was like that of a band of maniacs. In a\r\nprivate letter written by David Rittenhouse at this time, he says,\r\n\"About fifty of these scoundrels marched by my workshop. I have seen\r\nhundreds of Indians travelling the country, and can with truth affirm\r\nthat the behavior of these fellows was ten times more savage and brutal\r\nthan theirs. Frightening women by running the muzzles of guns through\r\nwindows, hallooing and swearing; attacking men without the least\r\nprovocation, dragging them by the hair to the ground, and pretending to\r\nscalp them; shooting dogs and fowls: these are some of their exploits.\"\r\n\r\nIt is almost past belief that at this time many people justified these\r\nacts. An Episcopalian clergyman in Lancaster wrote vindicating them,\r\n\"bringing Scripture to prove that it was right to destroy the heathen;\"\r\nand the \"Presbyterians think they have a better justification—nothing\r\nless than the Word of God,\" says one of the writers on the massacre.\r\n\r\n\"With the Scriptures in their hands and mouths, they can set at naught\r\nthat express command, 'Thou shalt do no murder,' and justify their\r\nwickedness by the command given to Joshua to destroy the heathen. Horrid\r\nperversion of Scripture and religion, to father the worst of crimes on\r\nthe God of Love and Peace!\" It is a trite saying that history repeats\r\nitself; but it is impossible to read now these accounts of the massacres\r\nof defenceless and peaceable Indians in the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, without the reflection that the record of the nineteenth is\r\nblackened by the same stains. What Pennsylvania pioneers did in 1763 to\r\nhelpless and peaceable Indians of Conestoga, Colorado pioneers did in\r\n1864 to helpless and peaceable Cheyennes at Sand Creek, and have\r\nthreatened to do again to helpless and peaceable Utes in 1880. The word\r\n\"extermination\" is as ready on the frontiersman's tongue to-day as it\r\nwas a hundred years ago; and the threat is more portentous now, seeing\r\nthat we are, by a whole century of prosperity, stronger and more\r\nnumerous, and the Indians are, by a whole century of suffering and\r\noppression, fewer and weaker. But our crime is baser and our infamy\r\ndeeper in the same proportion.\r\n\r\nClose upon this Conestoga massacre followed a \"removal\" of friendly\r\nIndians—the earliest on record, and one whose cruelty and cost to the\r\nsuffering Indians well entitle it to a place in a narrative of\r\nmassacres.\r\n\r\nEverywhere in the provinces fanatics began to renew the old cry that the\r\nIndians were the Canaanites whom God had commanded Joshua to destroy;\r\nand that these wars were a token of God's displeasure with the Europeans\r\nfor permitting the \"heathen\" to live. Soon it became dangerous for a\r\nMoravian Indian to be seen anywhere. In vain did he carry one of the\r\nPennsylvania governor's passports in his pocket. He was liable to be\r\nshot at sight, with no time to pull his passport out. Even in the\r\nvillages there was no safety. The devoted congregations watched and\r\nlistened night and day, not knowing at what hour they might hear the\r\nfatal warwhoop of hostile members of their own race, coming to slay\r\nthem; or the sudden shots of white settlers, coming to avenge on them\r\noutrages committed by savages hundreds of miles away.\r\n\r\nWith every report that arrived of Indian massacres at the North, the\r\nfury of the white people all over the country rose to greater height,\r\nincluding even Christian Indians in its unreasoning hatred. But, in the\r\npious language of a narrative written by one of the Moravian\r\nmissionaries, \"God inclined the hearts of the chief magistrates to\r\nprotect them. November 6th an express arrived from Philadelphia,\r\nbringing an order that all the baptized Indians from Nain and\r\nWechquetank should be brought to Philadelphia, and be protected in that\r\ncity, having first delivered up their arms.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later both these congregations set out on their sad journey,\r\nweeping as they left their homes. They joined forces at Bethlehem, on\r\nthe banks of the Lecha, and \"entered upon their pilgrimage in the name\r\nof the Lord, the congregation of Bethlehem standing spectators, and, as\r\nthey passed, commending them to the grace and protection of God, with\r\nsupplication and tears.\"\r\n\r\nFour of the Moravian missionaries were with them, and some of the\r\nbrethren from Bethlehem accompanied them all the way, \"the sheriff, Mr.\r\nJennings, caring for them as a father.\"\r\n\r\nThe aged, the sick, and the little children were carried in wagons. All\r\nthe others, women and men, went on foot. The November rains had made the\r\nroads very heavy. As the weary and heart-broken people toiled slowly\r\nalong through the mud, they were saluted with curses and abuse on all\r\nsides. As they passed through the streets of Germantown a mob gathered\r\nand followed them, taunting them with violent threats of burning,\r\nhanging, and other tortures. It was said that a party had been organized\r\nto make a serious attack on them, but was deterred by the darkness and\r\nthe storm. Four days were consumed in this tedious march, and on the\r\n11th of November they reached Philadelphia. Here, spite of the\r\ngovernor's positive order, the officers in command at the barracks\r\nrefused to allow them to enter. From ten in the forenoon till three in\r\nthe afternoon there the helpless creatures stood before the shut\r\ngate—messengers going back and forth between the defiant garrison and\r\nthe bewildered and impotent governor; the mob, thickening and growing\r\nmore and more riotous hour by hour, pressing the Indians on every side,\r\njeering them, reviling them, charging them with all manner of outrages,\r\nand threatening to kill them on the spot. The missionaries, bravely\r\nstanding beside their flock, in vain tried to stem or turn the torrent\r\nof insult and abuse. All that they accomplished was to draw down the\r\nsame insult and abuse on their own heads.\r\n\r\nNothing but the Indians' marvellous patience and silence saved them from\r\nbeing murdered by this exasperated mob. To the worst insults they made\r\nno reply, no attempt at retaliation or defence. They afterward said that\r\nthey had comforted themselves \"by considering what insult and mockery\r\nour Saviour had suffered on their account.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, after five hours of this, the governor, unable to compel the\r\ngarrison to open the barracks, sent an order that the Indians should be\r\ntaken to Province Island, an island in the Delaware River joined to the\r\nmain-land by a dam. Six miles more, every mile in risk of their lives,\r\nthe poor creatures walked. As they passed again through the city,\r\nthousands followed them, the old record says, and \"with such tumultuous\r\nclamor that they might truly be considered as sheep among wolves.\"\r\n\r\nLong after dark they reached the island, and were lodged in some unused\r\nbuildings, large and comfortless. There they kept their vesper service,\r\nand took heart from the fact that the verse for the day was that verse\r\nof the beautiful thirty-second psalm which has comforted so many\r\nperplexed souls: \"I will teach thee in the way thou shalt go.\"\r\n\r\nHere they settled themselves as best they could. The missionaries had\r\ntheir usual meetings with them, and humane people from Philadelphia,\r\n\"especially some of the people called Quakers,\" sent them provisions and\r\nfuel, and tried in various ways to \"render the inconvenience of their\r\nsituation less grievous.\"\r\n\r\nBefore they had been here a month some of the villages they had left\r\nwere burnt, and the riotous Paxton mob, which had murdered all the\r\npeaceful Conestoga Indians, announced its intention of marching on\r\nProvince Island and killing every Indian there. The Governor of\r\nPennsylvania launched proclamation after proclamation, forbidding any\r\none, under severest penalties, to molest the Indians under its\r\nprotection, and offering a reward of two hundred pounds for the\r\napprehension of the ringleaders of the insurgents. But public sentiment\r\nwas inflamed to such a degree that the Government was practically\r\npowerless. The known ringleaders and their sympathizers paraded\r\ncontemptuously in front of the governor's house, mocking him derisively,\r\nand not even two hundred pounds would tempt any man to attack them. In\r\nmany parts of Lancaster County parties were organized with the avowed\r\nintention of marching on Philadelphia and slaughtering all the Indians\r\nunder the protection of the Government. Late on the 29th of December\r\nrumors reached Philadelphia that a large party of these rioters were on\r\nthe road; and the governor, at daybreak the next day, sent large boats\r\nto Province Island, with orders to the missionaries to put their people\r\non board as quickly as possible, row to Leek Island, and await further\r\norders. In confusion and terror the congregations obeyed, and fled to\r\nLeek Island. Later in the day came a second letter from the governor,\r\ntelling them that the alarm had proved a false one. They might return to\r\nProvince Island, where he would send them a guard; and that they would\r\nbetter keep the boats, to be ready in case of a similar emergency.\r\n\r\n\"They immediately returned with joy to their former habitation,\" says\r\nthe old record, \"comforted by the text for the day—'The Lord is my\r\nstrength and my shield; my heart trusted in him' (Ps. xxviii., 7)—and\r\nclosed this remarkable year with prayer and thanksgiving for all the\r\nproofs of the help of God in so many heavy trials.\"\r\n\r\nFour days later the missionaries received a second order for instant\r\ndeparture. The reports of the murderous intentions of the rioters being\r\nconfirmed, and the governor seeing only too clearly his own\r\npowerlessness to contend with them, he had resolved to send the Indians\r\nnorthward, and put them under the protection of the English army, and\r\nespecially of Sir William Johnson, agent for the Crown among the\r\nNorthern Indians. No time was to be lost in carrying out this plan, for\r\nat any moment the mob might attack Province Island. Accordingly, at\r\nmidnight of January 4th, the fugitives set out once more, passed through\r\nPhiladelphia, undiscovered, to the meeting-house of the Moravian\r\nBrethren, where a breakfast had been provided for them. Here they were\r\nmet by the commissary, Mr. Fox, who had been detailed by the governor to\r\ntake charge of their journey. Mr. Fox, heart-stricken at their suffering\r\nappearance, immediately sent out and bought blankets to be distributed\r\namong them, as some protection against the cold. Wagons were brought for\r\nthe aged, sick, blind, little children, and the heavy baggage; and again\r\nthe pitiful procession took up its march. Again an angry mob gathered\r\nfast on its steps, cursing and reviling in a terrible manner, only\r\nrestrained by fear from laying violent hands on them. Except for the\r\nprotection of a military escort they would scarcely have escaped\r\nmurderous assault.\r\n\r\nAt Amboy two sloops lay ready to transport them to New York; but just as\r\nthey reached this place, and were preparing to go on shore, a messenger\r\narrived from the Governor of New York with angry orders that not an\r\nIndian should set foot in that territory. Even the ferry-men were\r\nforbidden, under heavy penalties, to ferry one across the river.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner in charge of them, in great perplexity, sent to the\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania for further orders, placing the Indians,\r\nmeantime, in the Amboy barracks. Here they held their daily meetings,\r\nsinging and praying with great unction, until finally many of their\r\nenemies were won to a hearty respect and sympathy for them; even\r\nsoldiers being heard to say, \"Would to God all the white people were as\r\ngood Christians as these Indians.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania governor had nothing left him to do but to order the\r\nIndians back again, and, accordingly, says the record, \"The Indian\r\ncongregation set out with cheerfulness on their return, in full\r\nconfidence that the Lord in his good providence, for wise purposes best\r\nknown to himself, had ordained their travelling thus to and fro. This\r\nbelief supported them under all the difficulties they met with in their\r\njourneys made in the severest part of winter.\"\r\n\r\nThey made the return journey under a large military escort, one party in\r\nadvance and one bringing up the rear. This escort was composed of\r\nsoldiers, who, having just come from Niagara, where they had been\r\nengaged in many fights with the North-western savages, were at first\r\ndisposed to treat these defenceless Indians with brutal cruelty; but\r\nthey were soon disarmed by the Indians' gentle patience, and became\r\ncordial and friendly.\r\n\r\nThe return journey was a hard one. The aged and infirm people had become\r\nmuch weakened by their repeated hardships, and the little children\r\nsuffered pitiably. In crossing some of the frozen rivers the feeble ones\r\nwere obliged to crawl on their hands and feet on the ice.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of January they reached Philadelphia, and were at once taken\r\nto the barracks, where almost immediately mobs began again to molest and\r\nthreaten them. The governor, thoroughly in earnest now, and determined\r\nto sustain his own honor and that of the province, had eight heavy\r\npieces of cannon mounted and a rampart thrown up in front of the\r\nbarracks. The citizens were called to arms, and so great was the\r\nexcitement that it is said even Quakers took guns and hurried to the\r\nbarracks to defend the Indians; and the governor himself went at\r\nmidnight to visit them, and reassure them by promises of protection.\r\n\r\nOn February 4th news was received that the rioters in large force were\r\napproaching the city. Hearing of the preparations made to receive them,\r\nthey did not venture to enter. On the night of the 5th, however, they\r\ndrew near again. The whole city was roused, church-bells rung, bonfires\r\nlighted, cannon fired, the inhabitants waked from their sleep and\r\nordered to the town-house, where arms were given to all. Four more\r\ncannon were mounted at the barracks, and all that day was spent in\r\nhourly expectation of the rebels. But their brave boasts were not\r\nfollowed up by action. Seeing that the city was in arms against them,\r\nthey halted. The governor then sent a delegation of citizens to ask them\r\nwhat they wanted.\r\n\r\nThey asserted, insolently, that there were among the Indians some who\r\nhad committed murders, and that they must be given up. Some of the\r\nringleaders were then taken into the barracks and asked to point out the\r\nmurderers. Covered with confusion, they were obliged to admit they could\r\nnot accuse one Indian there. They then charged the Quakers with having\r\ntaken away six and concealed them. This also was disproved, and finally\r\nthe excitement subsided.\r\n\r\nAll through the spring and summer the Indians remained prisoners in the\r\nbarracks. Their situation became almost insupportable from confinement,\r\nunwholesome diet, and the mental depression inevitable in their state.\r\nTo add to their misery small-pox broke out among them, and fifty-six\r\ndied in the course of the summer from this loathsome disease.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot describe,\" said the missionaries, \"the joy and fervent desire\r\nwhich most of them showed in the prospect of seeing their Saviour face\r\nto face. We saw with amazement the power of the blood of Jesus in the\r\nhearts of poor sinners.\" This was, no doubt, true; but there might well\r\nhave entered into the poor, dying creatures' thoughts an ecstasy at the\r\nmere prospect of freedom, after a year of such imprisonment and\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nAt last, on December 4th, the news of peace reached Philadelphia. On the\r\n6th a proclamation was published in all the newspapers that war was\r\nended and hostilities must cease. The joy with which the prisoned\r\nIndians received this news can hardly be conceived. It \"exceeded all\r\ndescriptions,\" says the record, and \"was manifested in thanksgivings and\r\npraises to the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nIt was still unsafe, however, for them to return to their old homes,\r\nwhich were thickly surrounded by white settlers, who were no less\r\nhostile now at heart than they had been before the proclamation of\r\npeace. It was decided, therefore, that they should make a new settlement\r\nin the Indian country on the Susquehanna River. After a touching\r\nfarewell to their old friends of the Bethlehem congregation, and a\r\ngrateful leave-taking of the governor, who had protected and supported\r\nthem for sixteen months, they set out on the 3d of April for their new\r\nhome in the wilderness. For the third time their aged, sick, and little\r\nchildren were placed in overloaded wagons, for a long and difficult\r\njourney—a far harder one than any they had yet taken. The\r\ninhospitalities of the lonely wilderness were worse than the curses and\r\nrevilings of riotous mobs. They were overtaken by severe snow-storms.\r\nThey camped in icy swamps, shivering all night around smouldering fires\r\nof wet wood. To avoid still hostile whites they had to take great\r\ncircuits through unbroken forests, where each foot of their path had to\r\nbe cut tree by tree. The men waded streams and made rafts for the women\r\nand children. Sometimes, when the streams were deep, they had to go into\r\ncamp, and wait till canoes could be built. They carried heavy loads of\r\ngoods for which there was no room in the wagons. Going over high, steep\r\nhills, they often had to divide their loads into small parcels, thus\r\ndoubling and trebling the road. Their provisions gave out. They ate the\r\nbitter wild potatoes. When the children cried with hunger, they peeled\r\nchestnut-trees, and gave them the sweet-juiced inner bark to suck. Often\r\nthey had no water except that from shallow, muddy puddles. Once they\r\nwere environed by blazing woods, whose fires burnt fiercely for hours\r\naround their encampment. Several of the party died, and were buried by\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n\"But all these trials were forgotten in their daily meetings, in which\r\nthe presence of the Lord was most sensibly and comfortably felt. These\r\nwere always held in the evening, around a large fire, in the open air.\"\r\n\r\nThey celebrated a \"joyful commemoration\" of Easter, and spent the\r\nPassion-week \"in blessed contemplation\" of the sufferings of Jesus,\r\nwhose \"presence supported them under all afflictions, insomuch that they\r\nnever lost their cheerfulness and resignation\" during the five long\r\nweeks of this terrible journey.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of May they arrived at Machwihilusing, and \"forgot all their\r\npain and trouble for joy that they had reached the place of their future\r\nabode. *** With offers of praise and thanksgiving, they devoted\r\nthemselves anew to Him who had given them rest for the soles of their\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\n\"With renewed courage\" they selected their home on the banks of the\r\nSusquehanna, and proceeded to build houses. They gave to the settlement\r\nthe name of Friedenshutten—a name full of significance, as coming from\r\nthe hearts of these persecuted wanderers: Friedenshutten—\"Tents of\r\nPeace.\"\r\n\r\nIf all this persecution had fallen upon these Indians because they were\r\nChristians, the record, piteous as it is, would be only one out of\r\nthousands of records of the sufferings of Christian martyrs, and would\r\nstir our sympathies less than many another. But this was not the case.\r\nIt was simply because they were Indians that the people demanded their\r\nlives, and would have taken them, again and again, except that all the\r\npower of the Government was enlisted for their protection. The fact of\r\ntheir being Christians did not enter in, one way or the other, any more\r\nthan did the fact that they were peaceable. They were Indians, and the\r\nfrontiersmen of Pennsylvania intended either to drive all Indians out of\r\ntheir State or kill them, just as the frontiersmen of Nebraska and of\r\nColorado now intend to do if they can. We shall see whether the United\r\nStates Government is as strong to-day as the Government of the Province\r\nof Pennsylvania was in 1763; or whether it will try first (and fail), as\r\nJohn Penn did, to push the helpless, hunted creatures off somewhere into\r\na temporary makeshift of shelter, for a temporary deferring of the\r\ntrouble of protecting them.\r\n\r\nSixteen years after the Conestoga massacre came that of Gnadenhütten,\r\nthe blackest crime on the long list; a massacre whose equal for\r\ntreachery and cruelty cannot be pointed out in the record of massacres\r\nof whites by Indians.\r\n\r\nII.—_The Gnadenhütten Massacre._\r\n\r\nIn the year 1779 the congregations of Moravian Indians living at\r\nGnadenhütten, Salem, and Schonbrun, on the Muskingum River, were\r\ncompelled by hostile Indians to forsake their villages and go northward\r\nto the Sandusky River. This movement was instigated by the English, who\r\nhad become suspicious that the influence of the Moravian missionaries\r\nwas thrown on the side of the colonies, and that their villages were\r\nsafe centres of information and supplies. These Indians having taken no\r\npart whatever in the war, there was no pretext for open interference\r\nwith them; but the English agents found it no difficult matter to stir\r\nup the hostile tribes to carry out their designs. And when the harassed\r\ncongregations finally consented to move, the savages who escorted them\r\nwere commanded by English officers.\r\n\r\n\"The savages drove them forward like cattle,\" says an old narrative;\r\n\"the white brethren and sisters in the midst, surrounded by the\r\nbelieving Indians.\" \"One morning, when the latter could not set out as\r\nexpeditiously as the savages thought proper, they attacked the white\r\nbrethren, and forced them to set out alone, whipping their horses\r\nforward till they grew wild, and not even allowing mothers time to\r\nsuckle their children. The road was exceeding bad, leading through a\r\ncontinuance of swamps. Sister Zeisberger fell twice from her horse, and\r\nonce, hanging in the stirrup, was dragged for some time; but assistance\r\nwas soon at hand, and the Lord preserved her from harm. Some of the\r\nbelieving Indians followed them as fast as possible, but with all their\r\nexertions did not overtake them till night.\"\r\n\r\nFor one month these unfortunate people journeyed through the wilds in\r\nthis way. When they reached the Sandusky Creek the savages left them to\r\ntake care of themselves as best they might. They were over a hundred\r\nmiles from their homes, \"in a wilderness where there was neither game\r\nnor provisions.\" Here they built huts of logs and bark. They had neither\r\nbeds nor blankets. In fact, the only things which the savages had left\r\nthem were their utensils for making maple sugar. It was the middle of\r\nOctober when they reached Sandusky. Already it was cold, and the winter\r\nwas drawing near. In November Governor De Peyster, the English commander\r\nat Fort Detroit, summoned the missionaries to appear before him and\r\nrefute the accusations brought against their congregations of having\r\naided and abetted the colonies.\r\n\r\n\"The missionaries answered that they doubted not in the least but that\r\nvery evil reports must have reached his ears, as the treatment they had\r\nmet with had sufficiently proved that they were considered as guilty\r\npersons, but that these reports were false. *** That Congress, indeed,\r\nknew that they were employed as missionaries to the Indians, and did not\r\ndisturb them in their labors; but had never in anything given them\r\ndirections how to proceed.\"\r\n\r\nThe governor, convinced of the innocence and single-heartedness of these\r\nnoble men, publicly declared that \"he felt great satisfaction in their\r\nendeavors to civilize and Christianize the Indians, and would permit\r\nthem to return to their congregations.\" He then gave them passports for\r\ntheir journey back to Sandusky, and appended a permission that they\r\nshould perform the functions of their office among the Christian Indians\r\nwithout molestation.\r\n\r\nThis left them at rest so far as apprehensions of attack from hostile\r\nIndians were concerned; but there still remained the terrible\r\napprehension of death by starvation and cold. Deep snows lay on the\r\nground. Their hastily-built huts were so small that it was impossible to\r\nmake large fires in them. Their floors being only the bare earth,\r\nwhenever a thaw came the water forced itself up and then froze again.\r\nCattle died for lack of food, and their carcasses were greedily\r\ndevoured; nursing children died for want of nourishment from their\r\nstarving mothers' breasts; the daily allowance of corn to each adult was\r\none pint, and even this pittance it was found would not last till\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, \"they celebrated the Christmas holidays with cheerfulness\r\nand blessing, and concluded this remarkable year with thanks and praise\r\nto Him who is ever the Saviour of his people. But, having neither bread\r\nnor wine, they could not keep the communion.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the corn still stood ungathered in their old fields on the\r\nMuskingum River. Weather-beaten, frozen, as it was, it would be still a\r\npriceless store to these starving people. The project of going back\r\nthere after it began to be discussed. It was one hundred and twenty-five\r\nmiles' journey; but food in abundance lay at the journey's end. Finally\r\nit was decided that the attempt should be made. Their first plan was to\r\nhide their families in the woods at some distance from the settlements\r\nlest there might be some danger from hostile whites. On their way,\r\nhowever, they were met by some of their brethren from Schonbrun, who\r\nadvised them to go back openly into their deserted towns, assuring them\r\nthat the Americans were friendly to them now. They accordingly did so,\r\nand remained for several weeks at Salem and Gnadenhütten, working day\r\nand night gathering and husking the weather-beaten corn, and burying it\r\nin holes in the ground in the woods for future supply. On the very day\r\nthat they were to have set off with their packs of corn, to return to\r\ntheir starving friends and relatives at Sandusky, a party of between one\r\nand two hundred whites made their appearance at Gnadenhütten. Seeing the\r\nIndians scattered all through the cornfields, they rode up to them,\r\nexpressing pleasure at seeing them, and saying that they would take them\r\ninto Pennsylvania, to a place where they would be out of all reach of\r\npersecution from the hostile savages or the English. They represented\r\nthemselves as \"friends and brothers, who had purposely come out to\r\nrelieve them from the distress brought on them on account of their being\r\nfriends to the American people. *** The Christian Indians, not in the\r\nleast doubting their sincerity, walked up to them and thanked them for\r\nbeing so kind; while the whites again gave assurances that they would\r\nmeet with good treatment from them. They then advised them to\r\ndiscontinue their work and cross over to the town, in order to make\r\nnecessary arrangements for the journey, as they intended to take them\r\nout of the reach of their enemies, and where they would be supplied\r\nabundantly with all they stood in need of.\"\r\n\r\nThey proposed to take them to Pittsburg, where they would be out of the\r\nway of any assault made by the English or the savages. This the Indians\r\nheard, one of their missionaries writes, \"with resignation, concluding\r\nthat God would perhaps choose this method to put an end to their\r\nsufferings. Prepossessed with this idea, they cheerfully delivered their\r\nguns, hatchets, and other weapons to the murderers, who promised to take\r\ngood care of them, and in Pittsburg to return every article to its\r\nrightful owner. Our Indians even showed them all those things which they\r\nhad secreted in the woods, assisted in packing them up, and emptied all\r\ntheir beehives for these pretended friends.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time one of the assistants, John Martin by name, went to\r\nSalem, ten miles distant, and carried the good news that a party of\r\nwhites had come from the settlements to carry them to a place of safety\r\nand give them protection. \"The Salem Indians,\" says the same narrative,\r\n\"did not hesitate to accept of this proposal, believing unanimously that\r\nGod had sent the Americans to release them from their disagreeable\r\nsituation at Sandusky, and imagining that when arrived at Pittsburg they\r\nmight soon find a safe place to build a settlement, and easily procure\r\nadvice and assistance from Bethlehem.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the whites expressed a desire to see the village of Salem, were\r\nconducted thither, and received with much friendship by the Indians. On\r\nthe way they entered into spiritual conversation with their unsuspecting\r\ncompanions, feigning great piety and discoursing on many religious and\r\nscriptural subjects. They offered also to assist the Salem Indians in\r\nmoving their effects.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the defenceless Indians at Gnadenhütten were suddenly\r\nattacked, driven together, bound with ropes, and confined. As soon as\r\nthe Salem Indians arrived, they met with the same fate.\r\n\r\nThe murderers then held a council to decide what should be done with\r\nthem. By a majority of votes it was decided to kill them all the next\r\nday. To the credit of humanity be it recorded, that there were in this\r\nband a few who remonstrated, declared that these Indians were innocent\r\nand harmless, and should be set at liberty, or, at least, given up to\r\nthe Government as prisoners. Their remonstrances were unavailing, and,\r\nfinding that they could not prevail on these monsters to spare the\r\nIndians' lives, \"they wrung their hands, calling God to witness that\r\nthey were innocent of the blood of these Christian Indians. They then\r\nwithdrew to some distance from the scene of slaughter.\"\r\n\r\nThe majority were unmoved, and only disagreed as to the method of\r\nputting their victims to death. Some were for burning them alive; others\r\nfor tomahawking and scalping them. The latter method was determined on,\r\nand a message was sent to the Indians that, \"as they were Christian\r\nIndians, they might prepare themselves in a Christian manner, for they\r\nmust all die to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the narrative is best told in the words of the Moravian\r\nmissionaries: \"It may be easily conceived how great their terror was at\r\nhearing a sentence so unexpected. However, they soon recollected\r\nthemselves, and patiently suffered the murderers to lead them into two\r\nhouses, in one of which the brethren were confined and in the other the\r\nsisters and children. *** Finding that all entreaties to save their\r\nlives were to no purpose, and that some, more blood-thirsty than others,\r\nwere anxious to begin upon them, they united in begging a short delay,\r\nthat they might prepare themselves for death, which request was granted\r\nthem. Then asking pardon for whatever offence they had given, or grief\r\nthey had occasioned to each other, they knelt down, offering fervent\r\nprayers to God their Saviour and kissing one another. Under a flood of\r\ntears, fully resigned to his will, they sung praises unto him, in the\r\njoyful hope that they would soon be relieved from all pains and join\r\ntheir Redeemer in everlasting bliss. *** The murderers, impatient to\r\nmake a beginning, came again to them while they were singing, and,\r\ninquiring whether they were now ready for dying, they were answered in\r\nthe affirmative, adding that they had commended their immortal souls to\r\nGod, who had given them the assurance in their hearts that he would\r\nreceive their souls. One of the party, now taking up a cooper's mallet\r\nwhich lay in the house, saying, 'How exactly this will answer for the\r\npurpose,' began with Abraham, and continued knocking down one after\r\nanother until he counted fourteen that he had killed with his own hands.\r\nHe now handed the instrument to one of his fellow-murderers, saying: 'My\r\narm fails me. Go on in the same way. I think I have done pretty well.'\r\nIn another house, where mostly women and children were confined, Judith,\r\na remarkably pious aged widow, was the first victim. After they had\r\nfinished the horrid deed they retreated to a small distance from the\r\nslaughterhouses; but, after a while, returning again to view the dead\r\nbodies, and finding one of them (Abel), although scalped and mangled,\r\nattempting to raise himself from the floor, they so renewed their blows\r\nupon him that he never rose again. *** Thus ninety-six persons magnified\r\nthe name of the Lord by patiently meeting a cruel death. Sixty-two were\r\ngrown persons and thirty-four children. Many of them were born of\r\nChristian parents in the society, and were among those who in the year\r\n1763 were taken under the protection of the Pennsylvania Government at\r\nthe time of the riots of the Paxton Boys. *** Two boys, about fourteen\r\nyears of age, almost miraculously escaped from this massacre. One of\r\nthem was scalped and thrown down for dead. Recovering himself, he looked\r\naround; but, with great presence of mind, lay down again quickly,\r\nfeigning death. In a few moments he saw the murderers return, and again\r\nbury their hatchets in the head of Abel, who was attempting to rise,\r\nthough scalped and terribly mangled. As soon as it was dark, Thomas\r\ncrept over the dead bodies and escaped to the woods, where he hid\r\nhimself till night. The other lad, who was confined in the house with\r\nthe women, contrived unnoticed to slip through a trap-door into the\r\ncellar, where he lay concealed through the day, the blood all the while\r\nrunning down through the floor in streams. At dark he escaped through a\r\nsmall window and crept to the woods, where he encountered Thomas, and\r\nthe two made their way together, after incredible hardships, to\r\nSandusky. To describe the grief and terror of the Indian congregation on\r\nhearing that so large a number of its members was so cruelly massacred\r\nis impossible. Parents wept and mourned for the loss of their children,\r\nhusbands for their wives, and wives for their husbands, children for\r\ntheir parents, sisters for brothers, and brothers for sisters. But they\r\nmurmured not, nor did they call for vengeance on the murderers, but\r\nprayed for them. And their greatest consolation was a full assurance\r\nthat all their beloved relatives were now at home in the presence of the\r\nLord, and in full possession of everlasting happiness.\"\r\n\r\nAn account of this massacre was given in the _Pennsylvania Gazette_, of\r\nApril 17th, 1782. It runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The people being greatly alarmed, and having received intelligence that\r\nthe Indian towns on the Muskingum had not moved, as reported, a number\r\nof men, properly provided, collected and rendezvoused on the Ohio,\r\nopposite the Mingo Bottom, with a desire to surprise the above towns.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred men swam the river, and proceeded to the towns on the\r\nMuskingum, where the Indians had collected a large quantity of\r\nprovisions to supply their war-parties. They arrived at the town in the\r\nnight, undiscovered, attacked the Indians in their cabins, and so\r\ncompletely surprised them that they killed and scalped upward of\r\nninety—but a few making their escape—about forty of whom were warriors,\r\nthe rest old women and children. About eighty horses fell into their\r\nhands, which they loaded with the plunder, the greatest part furs and\r\nskins, and returned to the Ohio without the loss of a man.\"\r\n\r\nIII.—_Massacres of Apaches._\r\n\r\nIn less than one hundred years from this Gnadenhütten massacre an\r\nofficer of the United States Army, stationed at Camp Grant, in Arizona\r\nTerritory, writes to his commanding officer the following letter:\r\n\r\n                         \"Camp Grant, Arizona Territory, May 17th, 1871.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR COLONEL,—Thanks for your kind letter of last week. If I could see\r\nyou and have a long talk, and answer all your questions, I could come\r\nnearer giving you a clear idea of the history of the Indians at this\r\npost than by any written account. Having had them constantly under my\r\nobservation for nearly three months, and the care of them constantly on\r\nmy mind, certain things have become so much a matter of certainty to me\r\nthat I am liable to forget the amount of evidence necessary to convince\r\neven the most unprejudiced mind that has not been brought in contact\r\nwith them. I will, however, try and give you a connected account, and if\r\nit proves not sufficiently full in detail, you may be sure all its\r\npositive statements will be sustained by the testimony of all competent\r\njudges who have been at this post and cognizant of the facts.\r\n\r\n\"Sometime in February a party of five old women came in under a flag of\r\ntruce, with a letter from Colonel Greene, saying they were in search of\r\na boy, the son of one of the number taken prisoner near Salt River some\r\nmonths before. This boy had been well cared for, and had become attached\r\nto his new mode of life, and did not wish to return. The party were\r\nkindly treated, rationed while here, and after two days went away,\r\nasking permission to return. They came in about eight days, I think,\r\nwith a still larger number, with some articles for sale, to purchase\r\nmanta, as they were nearly naked. Before going away they said a young\r\nchief would like to come in with a party and have a talk. This I\r\nencouraged, and in a few days he came with about twenty-five of his\r\nband. He stated in brief that he was chief of a band of about one\r\nhundred and fifty of what were originally the Aravapa Apaches; that he\r\nwanted peace; that he and his people had no home, and could make none,\r\nas they were at all times apprehensive of the approach of the cavalry. I\r\ntold him he should go to the White Mountains. He said, 'That is not our\r\ncountry, neither are they our people. We are at peace with them, but\r\nnever have mixed with them. Our fathers and their fathers before them\r\nhave lived in these mountains, and have raised corn in this valley. We\r\nare taught to make mescal, our principal article of food, and in summer\r\nand winter here we have a never-failing supply. At the White Mountains\r\nthere is none, and without it now we get sick. Some of our people have\r\nbeen in at Goodwin, and for a short time at the White Mountains; but\r\nthey are not contented, and they all say, \"Let us go to the Aravapa and\r\nmake a final peace, and never break it.\"'\r\n\r\n\"I told him I had no authority to make any treaty with him, or to\r\npromise him that he would be allowed a permanent home here, but that he\r\ncould bring in his hand, and I would feed them, and report his wishes to\r\nthe Department commander. In the mean time runners had been in from two\r\nother small bands, asking the same privileges and giving the same\r\nreasons. I made the same reply to all, and by about the 11th of March I\r\nhad over three hundred here. I wrote a detailed account of the whole\r\nmatter, and sent it by express to Department Head-quarters, asking for\r\ninstructions, having only the general policy of the Government in such\r\ncases for my guidance. After waiting more than six weeks my letter was\r\nreturned to me without comment, except calling my attention to the fact\r\nthat it was not briefed properly. At first I put them in camp, about\r\nhalf a mile from the post, and counted them, and issued their rations\r\nevery second day. The number steadily increased until it reached the\r\nnumber of five hundred and ten.\r\n\r\n\"Knowing, as I did, that the responsibility of the whole movement rested\r\nwith me, and that, in case of any loss to the Government coming of it, I\r\nshould be the sufferer, I kept them continually under my observation\r\ntill I came not only to know the faces of the men, but of the women and\r\nchildren. They were nearly naked, and needed everything in the way of\r\nclothing. I stopped the Indians from bringing hay, that I might buy of\r\nthese. I arranged a system of tickets with which to pay them and\r\nencourage them; and to be sure that they were properly treated, I\r\npersonally attended to the weighing. I also made inquiries as to the\r\nkind of goods sold them, and prices. This proved a perfect success; not\r\nonly the women and children engaged in the work, but the men. The amount\r\nfurnished by them in about two months was nearly 300,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\"During this time many small parties had been out with passes for a\r\ncertain number of days to burn mescal. These parties were always mostly\r\nwomen, and I made myself sure by noting the size of the party, and from\r\nthe amount of mescal brought in, that no treachery was intended. From\r\nthe first I was determined to know not only all they did, but their\r\nhopes and intentions. For this purpose I spent hours each day with them\r\nin explaining to them the relations they should sustain to the\r\nGovernment, and their prospects for the future in case of either\r\nobedience or disobedience. I got from them in return much of their\r\nhabits of thought and rules of action. I made it a point to tell them\r\nall they wished to know, and in the plainest and most positive manner.\r\nThey were readily obedient, and remarkably quick of comprehension. They\r\nwere happy and contented, and took every opportunity to show it. They\r\nhad sent out runners to two other bands which were connected with them\r\nby intermarriages, and had received promises from them that they would\r\ncome in and join them. I am confident, from all I have been able to\r\nlearn, that but for this unlooked-for butchery, by this time we would\r\nhave had one thousand persons, and at least two hundred and fifty\r\nable-bodied men. As their number increased and the weather grew warmer,\r\nthey asked and obtained permission to move farther up the Aravapa to\r\nhigher ground and plenty of water, and opposite to the ground they were\r\nproposing to plant. They were rationed every third day. Captain Stanwood\r\narrived about the first of April, and took command of the post. He had\r\nreceived, while _en route_, verbal instructions from General Stoneman to\r\nrecognize and feed any Indians he might find at the post as prisoners of\r\nwar. After he had carefully inspected all things pertaining to their\r\nconduct and treatment, he concluded to make no changes, but had become\r\nso well satisfied of the integrity of their intentions that he left on\r\nthe 24th with his whole troop for a long scout in the lower part of the\r\nTerritory. The ranchmen in this vicinity were friendly and kind to them,\r\nand felt perfectly secure, and had agreed with me to employ them at a\r\nfair rate of pay to harvest their barley. The Indians seemed to have\r\nlost their characteristic anxiety to purchase ammunition, and had, in\r\nmany instances, sold their best bows and arrows. I made frequent visits\r\nto their camp, and if any were absent from count, made it my business to\r\nknow why.\r\n\r\n\"Such was the condition of things up to the morning of the 30th of\r\nApril. They had so won on me that, from my first idea of treating them\r\njustly and honestly, as an officer of the army, I had come to feel a\r\nstrong personal interest in helping to show them the way to a higher\r\ncivilization. I had come to feel respect for men who, ignorant and\r\nnaked, were still ashamed to lie or steal; and for women who would work\r\ncheerfully like slaves to clothe themselves and children, but, untaught,\r\nheld their virtue above price. Aware of the lies industriously\r\ncirculated by the puerile press of the country, I was content to know I\r\nhad positive proof they were so.\r\n\r\n\"I had ceased to have any fears of their leaving here, and only dreaded\r\nfor them that they might be at any time ordered to do so. They\r\nfrequently expressed anxiety to hear from the general, that they might\r\nhave confidence to build for themselves better houses; but would always\r\nsay, 'You know what we want, and if you can't see him you can write, and\r\ndo for us what you can.' It is possible that, during this time,\r\nindividuals from here had visited other bands; but that any number had\r\never been out to assist in any marauding expedition I know is false. On\r\nthe morning of April 30th I was at breakfast at 7.30 o'clock, when a\r\ndespatch was brought to me by a sergeant of Company P, 21st Infantry,\r\nfrom Captain Penn, commanding Camp Lowell, informing me that a large\r\nparty had left Tucson on the 28th with the avowed purpose of killing all\r\nthe Indians at this post. I immediately sent the two interpreters,\r\nmounted, to the Indian camp, with orders to tell the chiefs the exact\r\nstate of things, and for them to bring their entire party inside the\r\npost. As I had no cavalry, and but about fifty infantry (all recruits),\r\nand no other officer, I could not leave the post to go to their defence.\r\nMy messengers returned in about an hour with intelligence that they\r\ncould find no living Indians.\r\n\r\n\"Their camp was burning, and the ground strewed with their dead and\r\nmutilated women and children. I immediately mounted a party of about\r\ntwenty soldiers and citizens, and sent them with the post surgeon with a\r\nwagon to bring in the wounded, if any could be found. The party returned\r\nlate in the afternoon, having found no wounded, and without having been\r\nable to communicate with any of the survivors. Early the next morning I\r\ntook a similar party with spades and shovels, and went out and buried\r\nthe dead immediately in and about the camp. I had, the day before,\r\noffered the interpreters, or any one who would do so, $100 to go to the\r\nmountains and communicate with them, and convince them that no officer\r\nor soldier of the United States Government had been concerned in the\r\nvile transaction; and, failing in this, I thought the act of caring for\r\ntheir dead would be an evidence to them of our sympathy, at least, and\r\nthe conjecture proved correct; for while we were at the work, many of\r\nthem came to the spot and indulged in expressions of grief too wild and\r\nterrible to be described.\r\n\r\n\"That evening they began to come in from all directions, singly and in\r\nsmall parties, so changed as hardly to be recognizable in the\r\nforty-eight hours during which they had neither eaten nor slept. Many of\r\nthe men, whose families had all been killed, when I spoke to them and\r\nexpressed sympathy for them, were obliged to turn away, unable to speak,\r\nand too proud to show their grief. The women whose children had been\r\nkilled or stolen were convulsed with grief, and looked to me\r\nappealingly, as if I were their last hope on earth. Children, who two\r\ndays before had been full of frolic, kept at a distance, expressing\r\nwondering horror.\r\n\r\n\"I did what I could: I fed them, talked to them, and listened patiently\r\nto their accounts. I sent horses to the mountains to bring in two badly\r\nwounded women, one shot through the left leg, one with an arm shattered.\r\nThese were attended to, and are doing well, and will recover.\r\n\r\n\"Their camp was surrounded and attacked at daybreak. So sudden and\r\nunexpected was it, that I found a number of women shot while asleep\r\nbeside their bundles of hay, which they had collected to bring in on\r\nthat morning. The wounded who were unable to get away had their brains\r\nbeaten out with clubs or stones, while some were shot full of arrows\r\nafter having been mortally wounded by gun-shots. The bodies were all\r\nstripped. Of the number buried, one was an old man, and one was a\r\nwell-grown boy; all the rest women and children. Of the whole number\r\nkilled and missing—about one hundred and twenty-five—only eight were\r\nmen. It has been said that the men were not there: they were all there.\r\nOn the 28th we counted one hundred and twenty-eight men, a small number\r\nbeing absent for mescal, all of whom have since been in. I have spent a\r\ngood deal of time with them since the affair, and have been astonished\r\nat their continued unshaken faith in me, and their perfectly clear\r\nunderstanding of their misfortune. They say, 'We know there are a great\r\nmany white men and Mexicans who do not wish us to live at peace. We know\r\nthat the Papagos would never have come out against us at this time\r\nunless they had been persuaded to do so.' What they do not understand\r\nis, while they are at peace and are conscious of no wrong intent, that\r\nthey should be murdered.\r\n\r\n\"One of the chiefs said: 'I no longer want to live; my women and\r\nchildren have been killed before my face, and I have been unable to\r\ndefend them. Most Indians in my place would take a knife and cut their\r\nthroats; but I will live to show these people that all they have done,\r\nand all they can do, shall not make me break faith with you so long as\r\nyou will stand by us and defend us, in a language we know nothing of, to\r\na great governor we never have and never shall see.'\r\n\r\n\"About their captives they say: 'Get them back for us. Our little boys\r\nwill grow up slaves, and our girls, as soon as they are large enough,\r\nwill be diseased prostitutes, to get money for whoever owns them. Our\r\nwomen work hard, and are good women, and they and our children have no\r\ndiseases. Our dead you cannot bring to life; but those that are living\r\nwe gave to you, and we look to you, who can write and talk and have\r\nsoldiers, to get them back.'\r\n\r\n\"I assure you it is no easy task to convince them of my zeal when they\r\nsee so little being done. I have pledged my word to them that I never\r\nwould rest, day or night, until they should have justice, and just now I\r\nwould as soon leave the army as to be ordered away from them, or be\r\nobliged to order them away from here. But you well know the difficulties\r\nin the way. You know that parties who would engage in murder like this\r\ncould and would make statements and multiply affidavits without end in\r\ntheir justification. I know you will use your influence on the right\r\nside. I believe, with them, this may be made either a means of making\r\ngood citizens of them and their children, or of driving them out to a\r\nhopeless war of extermination. They ask to be allowed to live here in\r\ntheir old homes, where nature supplies nearly all their wants. They ask\r\nfor a fair and impartial trial of their faith, and they ask that all\r\ntheir captive children may be returned to them. Is their demand\r\nunreasonable?\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was written to Colonel T. G. C. Lee, U.S.A., by Lieut. Royal\r\nE. Whitman, 3d U.S. Cavalry. It is published in the Report of the Board\r\nof Indian Commissioners for 1871. There is appended to it the following\r\naffidavit of the post surgeon at Camp Grant:\r\n\r\n\"On this 16th day of September, 1871, personally appeared Conant B.\r\nBrierley, who, being duly sworn according to law, deposeth and saith: 'I\r\nam acting-assistant surgeon, U.S.A., at Camp Grant, Arizona, where I\r\narrived April 25th, 1871, and reported to the commanding officer for\r\nduty as medical officer. Some four hundred Apache Indians were at that\r\ntime held as prisoners of war by the military stationed at Camp Grant,\r\nand during the period intervening between April 25th and 30th I saw the\r\nIndians every day. They seemed very well contented, and were busily\r\nemployed in bringing in hay, which they sold for manta and such little\r\narticles as they desired outside the Government ration. April 29th\r\nChiquita and some of the other chiefs were at the post, and asked for\r\nseeds and for some hoes, stating that they had ground cleared and ready\r\nfor planting. They were told that the garden-seeds had been sent for,\r\nand would be up from Tucson in a few days. They then left, and I saw\r\nnothing more of them until after the killing.\r\n\r\n\"'Sunday morning I heard a rumor that the Indians had been attacked, and\r\nlearned from Lieutenant Whitman that he had sent the two interpreters to\r\nthe Indian camp to warn the Indians, and bring them down where they\r\ncould be protected, if possible. The interpreters returned and stated\r\nthat the attack had already been made and the Indians dispersed, and\r\nthat the attacking party were returning.\r\n\r\n\"'Lieutenant Whitman then ordered me to go to the Indian camp to render\r\nmedical assistance, and bring down any wounded I might find. I took\r\ntwelve men and a wagon, and proceeded without delay to the scene of the\r\nmurder. On my arrival I found that I should have but little use for the\r\nwagon or medicine. The work had been too thoroughly done. The camp had\r\nbeen fired, and the dead bodies of twenty-one women and children were\r\nlying scattered over the ground; those who had been wounded in the first\r\ninstance had their brains beaten out with stones. Two of the squaws had\r\nbeen first ravished, and then shot dead. One infant of some two months\r\nwas shot twice, and one leg nearly hacked off. *** I know from my own\r\npersonal observations that, during the time the Indians were in, after\r\nmy arrival, they were rationed every three days, and Indians absent had\r\nto be accounted for; their faces soon became familiar to me, and I could\r\nat once tell when any strange Indian came in.\r\n\r\n\"'And I furthermore state that I have been among nearly all the tribes\r\non the Pacific coast, and that I have never seen any Indians who showed\r\nthe intelligence, honesty, and desire to learn manifested by these\r\nIndians. I came among them greatly prejudiced against them; but, after\r\nbeing with them, I was compelled to admit that they were honest in their\r\nintentions, and really desired peace.\r\n\r\n                                                       \"'C. B. Brierley,\r\n                                    \"'Acting Assistant Surgeon, U.S.A.'\"\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is not the only instance of cruel outrage committed by white men on\r\nthe Apaches. In the Report of the Board of Indian Commissioners for 1871\r\nis the following letter from one of the Arizona pioneers, Mr. J. H.\r\nLyman, of Northampton, Mass. Mr. Lyman spent the years of 1840-'41 among\r\nthe Apaches, and thus briefly relates an occurrence which took place at\r\na time when they were friendly and cordial to all Americans going among\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n\"The Indians were then, as now, hostile to the Mexicans of Sonora, and\r\nthey were constantly making raids into the State and driving off the\r\ncattle. The Mexicans feared them, and were unable to meet them man to\r\nman. At that time American trappers found the beaver very abundant about\r\nthe head-waters of the Gila River, among those rich mountain valleys\r\nwhere the Apaches had, and still have, their secure retreats. At the\r\ntime I speak of there were two companies of trappers in that region. One\r\nof the companies, about seventeen men, was under a captain named\r\nJohnson. The other company consisted of thirty men, I think. I was\r\ntrapping on another head of the Gila, several miles north. The valleys\r\nwere full of Apaches, but all peaceful toward the white men, both\r\nIndians and whites visiting each other's camps constantly and\r\nfearlessly, with no thought of treachery or evil. Besides the Mexicans,\r\nthe only enemies of the Apaches were the Piutes and Navajoes, in the\r\nnorth-west. But here in their fastnesses they felt safe from all foes.\r\n\r\n\"One day Johnson concluded to go down into Sonora on a spree, as was\r\noccasionally the way with mountain-men. He there saw the Governor of\r\nSonora, who, knowing that he had the confidence of the Indians, offered\r\nhim an ounce of gold for every Apache scalp he would bring him. The\r\nbargain was struck. Johnson procured a small mountain howitzer, and\r\nthen, with supplies for his party, returned to his camp. Previous to\r\nentering it he loaded his howitzer with a quantity of bullets. On\r\napproaching the valley he was met by the Indians, who joyfully welcomed\r\nhim back, and proceeded at once to prepare the usual feast. While they\r\nwere boiling and roasting their venison and bear meat, and were gathered\r\nin a small group around the fire, laughing and chatting in anticipation\r\nof the pleasure they expected in entertaining their guests, Johnson told\r\nthose of his party who had remained behind of the offer of the governor,\r\nand with such details of temptation as easily overcame any scruples such\r\nmen might have.\r\n\r\n\"As they were all armed with rifles, which were always in hand day and\r\nnight, together with pistols in belt, they needed no preparation. The\r\nhowitzer, which the Indians might have supposed to be a small keg of\r\nwhiskey, was placed on the ground and pointed at the group of warriors,\r\nsquaws, and little children round the fire, watching the roasting meal.\r\n\r\n\"While they were thus engaged, with hearts full of kindly feelings\r\ntoward their white friends, Johnson gave the signal. The howitzer was\r\ndischarged, sending its load of bullets scattering and tearing through\r\nthe mass of miserable human beings, and nearly all who were not stricken\r\ndown were shot by the rifles. A very few succeeded in escaping into the\r\nravine, and fled over the dividing ridge into the northern valleys,\r\nwhere they met others of their tribe, to whom they told the horrible\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\"The Apaches at once showed that they could imitate their more civilized\r\nbrothers. Immediately a band of them went in search of the other company\r\nof trappers, who, of course, were utterly unconscious of Johnson's\r\ninfernal work. They were attacked, unprepared, and nearly all killed;\r\nand then the story that the Apaches were treacherous and cruel went\r\nforth into all the land, but nothing of the wrongs they had received.\"\r\n\r\nIs it to be wondered at that the Apaches became one of the most hostile\r\nand dangerous tribes on the Pacific coast?\r\n\r\nThese are but four massacres out of scores, whose history, if written,\r\nwould prove as clearly as do these, that, in the long contest between\r\nwhite men and Indians, the Indian has not always been the aggressor, and\r\nthat treachery and cruelty are by no means exclusively Indian traits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are within the limits of the United States between two hundred and\r\nfifty and three hundred thousand Indians, exclusive of those in Alaska.\r\nThe names of the different tribes and bands, as entered in the\r\nstatistical tables of the Indian Office Reports, number nearly three\r\nhundred. One of the most careful estimates which have been made of their\r\nnumbers and localities gives them as follows: \"In Minnesota and States\r\neast of the Mississippi, about 32,500; in Nebraska, Kansas, and the\r\nIndian Territory, 70,650; in the Territories of Dakota, Montana,\r\nWyoming, and Idaho, 65,000; in Nevada and the Territories of Colorado,\r\nNew Mexico, Utah, and Arizona, 84,000; and on the Pacific slope,\r\n48,000.\"\r\n\r\nOf these, 130,000 are self-supporting on their own reservations,\r\n\"receiving nothing from the Government except interest on their own\r\nmoneys, or annuities granted them in consideration of the cession of\r\ntheir lands to the United States.\"[31]\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  A Annual Report of Indian Commissioner for 1872.\r\n\r\nThis fact alone would seem sufficient to dispose forever of the\r\naccusation, so persistently brought against the Indian, that he will not\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOf the remainder, 84,000 are partially supported by the Government—the\r\ninterest money due them and their annuities, as provided by treaty,\r\nbeing inadequate to their subsistence on the reservations where they are\r\nconfined. In many cases, however, these Indians furnish a large part of\r\ntheir support—the White River Utes, for instance, who are reported by\r\nthe Indian Bureau as getting sixty-six per cent. of their living by\r\n\"root-digging, hunting, and fishing;\" the Squaxin band, in Washington\r\nTerritory, as earning seventy-five per cent., and the Chippewas of Lake\r\nSuperior as earning fifty per cent. in the same way. These facts also\r\nwould seem to dispose of the accusation that the Indian will not work.\r\n\r\nThere are about 55,000 who never visit an agency, over whom the\r\nGovernment does not pretend to have either control or care. These 55,000\r\n\"subsist by hunting, fishing, on roots, nuts, berries, etc., and by\r\nbegging and stealing;\" and this also seems to dispose of the accusation\r\nthat the Indian will not \"work for a living.\" There remains a small\r\nportion, about 31,000, that are entirely subsisted by the Government.\r\n\r\nThere is not among these three hundred bands of Indians one which has\r\nnot suffered cruelly at the hands either of the Government or of white\r\nsettlers. The poorer, the more insignificant, the more helpless the\r\nband, the more certain the cruelty and outrage to which they have been\r\nsubjected. This is especially true of the bands on the Pacific slope.\r\nThese Indians found themselves of a sudden surrounded by and caught up\r\nin the great influx of gold-seeking settlers, as helpless creatures on a\r\nshore are caught up in a tidal wave. There was not time for the\r\nGovernment to make treaties; not even time for communities to make laws.\r\nThe tale of the wrongs, the oppressions, the murders of the\r\nPacific-slope Indians in the last thirty years would be a volume by\r\nitself, and is too monstrous to be believed.\r\n\r\nIt makes little difference, however, where one opens the record of the\r\nhistory of the Indians; every page and every year has its dark stain.\r\nThe story of one tribe is the story of all, varied only by differences\r\nof time and place; but neither time nor place makes any difference in\r\nthe main facts. Colorado is as greedy and unjust in 1880 as was Georgia\r\nin 1830, and Ohio in 1795; and the United States Government breaks\r\npromises now as deftly as then, and with an added ingenuity from long\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nOne of its strongest supports in so doing is the wide-spread sentiment\r\namong the people of dislike to the Indian, of impatience with his\r\npresence as a \"barrier to civilization,\" and distrust of it as a\r\npossible danger. The old tales of the frontier life, with its horrors of\r\nIndian warfare, have gradually, by two or three generations' telling,\r\nproduced in the average mind something like an hereditary instinct of\r\nunquestioning and unreasoning aversion which it is almost impossible to\r\ndislodge or soften.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of pages of unimpeachable testimony on the side of\r\nthe Indian; but it goes for nothing, is set down as sentimentalism or\r\npartisanship, tossed aside and forgotten.\r\n\r\nPresident after president has appointed commission after commission to\r\ninquire into and report upon Indian affairs, and to make suggestions as\r\nto the best methods of managing them. The reports are filled with\r\neloquent statements of wrongs done to the Indians, of perfidies on the\r\npart of the Government; they counsel, as earnestly as words can, a trial\r\nof the simple and unperplexing expedients of telling truth, keeping\r\npromises, making fair bargains, dealing justly in all ways and all\r\nthings. These reports are bound up with the Government's Annual Reports,\r\nand that is the end of them. It would probably be no exaggeration to say\r\nthat not one American citizen out of ten thousand ever sees them or\r\nknows that they exist, and yet any one of them, circulated throughout\r\nthe country, read by the right-thinking, right-feeling men and women of\r\nthis land, would be of itself a \"campaign document\" that would initiate\r\na revolution which would not subside until the Indians' wrongs were, so\r\nfar as is now left possible, righted.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 President Grant appointed a commission of nine men, representing\r\nthe influence and philanthropy of six leading States, to visit the\r\ndifferent Indian reservations, and to \"examine all matters appertaining\r\nto Indian affairs.\"\r\n\r\nIn the report of this commission are such paragraphs as the following:\r\n\"To assert that 'the Indian will not work' is as true as it would be to\r\nsay that the white man will not work.\r\n\r\n\"Why should the Indian be expected to plant corn, fence lands, build\r\nhouses, or do anything but get food from day to day, when experience has\r\ntaught him that the product of his labor will be seized by the white man\r\nto-morrow? The most industrious white man would become a drone under\r\nsimilar circumstances. Nevertheless, many of the Indians\" (the\r\ncommissioners might more forcibly have said 130,000 of the Indians) \"are\r\nalready at work, and furnish ample refutation of the assertion that 'the\r\nIndian will not work,' There is no escape from the inexorable logic of\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\"The history of the Government connections with the Indians is a\r\nshameful record of broken treaties and unfulfilled promises. The history\r\nof the border white man's connection with the Indians is a sickening\r\nrecord of murder, outrage, robbery, and wrongs committed by the former,\r\nas the rule, and occasional savage outbreaks and unspeakably barbarous\r\ndeeds of retaliation by the latter, as the exception.\r\n\r\n\"Taught by the Government that they had rights entitled to respect, when\r\nthose rights have been assailed by the rapacity of the white man, the\r\narm which should have been raised to protect them has ever been ready to\r\nsustain the aggressor.\r\n\r\n\"The testimony of some of the highest military officers of the United\r\nStates is on record to the effect that, in our Indian wars, almost\r\nwithout exception, the first aggressions have been made by the white\r\nman; and the assertion is supported by every civilian of reputation who\r\nhas studied the subject. In addition to the class of robbers and outlaws\r\nwho find impunity in their nefarious pursuits on the frontiers, there is\r\na large class of professedly reputable men who use every means in their\r\npower to bring on Indian wars for the sake of the profit to be realized\r\nfrom the presence of troops and the expenditure of Government funds in\r\ntheir midst. They proclaim death to the Indians at all times in words\r\nand publications, making no distinction between the innocent and the\r\nguilty. They irate the lowest class of men to the perpetration of the\r\ndarkest deeds against their victims, and as judges and jurymen shield\r\nthem from the justice due to their crimes. Every crime committed by a\r\nwhite man against an Indian is concealed or palliated. Every offence\r\ncommitted by an Indian against a white man is borne on the wings of the\r\npost or the telegraph to the remotest corner of the land, clothed with\r\nall the horrors which the reality or imagination can throw around it.\r\nAgainst such influences as these the people of the United States need to\r\nbe warned.\"\r\n\r\nTo assume that it would be easy, or by any one sudden stroke of\r\nlegislative policy possible, to undo the mischief and hurt of the long\r\npast, set the Indian policy of the country right for the future, and\r\nmake the Indians at once safe and happy, is the blunder of a hasty and\r\nuninformed judgment. The notion which seems to be growing more\r\nprevalent, that simply to make all Indians at once citizens of the\r\nUnited States would be a sovereign and instantaneous panacea for all\r\ntheir ills and all the Government's perplexities, is a very\r\ninconsiderate one. To administer complete citizenship of a sudden, all\r\nround, to all Indians, barbarous and civilized alike, would be as\r\ngrotesque a blunder as to dose them all round with any one medicine,\r\nirrespective of the symptoms and needs of their diseases. It would kill\r\nmore than it would cure. Nevertheless, it is true, as was well stated by\r\none of the superintendents of Indian Affairs in 1857, that, \"so long as\r\nthey are not citizens of the United States, their rights of property\r\nmust remain insecure against invasion. The doors of the federal\r\ntribunals being barred against them while wards and dependents, they can\r\nonly partially exercise the rights of free government, or give to those\r\nwho make, execute, and construe the few laws they are allowed to enact,\r\ndignity sufficient to make them respectable. While they continue\r\nindividually to gather the crumbs that fall from the table of the United\r\nStates, idleness, improvidence, and indebtedness will be the rule, and\r\nindustry, thrift, and freedom from debt the exception. The utter absence\r\nof individual title to particular lands deprives every one among them of\r\nthe chief incentive to labor and exertion—the very mainspring on which\r\nthe prosperity of a people depends.\"\r\n\r\nAll judicious plans and measures for their safety and salvation must\r\nembody provisions for their becoming citizens as fast as they are fit,\r\nand must protect them till then in every right and particular in which\r\nour laws protect other \"persons\" who are not citizens.\r\n\r\nThere is a disposition in a certain class of minds to be impatient with\r\nany protestation against wrong which is unaccompanied or unprepared with\r\na quick and exact scheme of remedy. This is illogical. When pioneers in\r\na new country find a tract of poisonous and swampy wilderness to be\r\nreclaimed, they do not withhold their hands from fire and axe till they\r\nsee clearly which way roads should run, where good water will spring,\r\nand what crops will best grow on the redeemed land. They first clear the\r\nswamp. So with this poisonous and baffling part of the domain of our\r\nnational affairs—let us first \"clear the swamp.\"\r\n\r\nHowever great perplexity and difficulty there may be in the details of\r\nany and every plan possible for doing at this late day anything like\r\njustice to the Indian, however hard it may be for good statesmen and\r\ngood men to agree upon the things that ought to be done, there certainly\r\nis, or ought to be, no perplexity whatever, no difficulty whatever, in\r\nagreeing upon certain things that ought not to be done, and which must\r\ncease to be done before the first steps can be taken toward righting the\r\nwrongs, curing the ills, and wiping out the disgrace to us of the\r\npresent condition of our Indians.\r\n\r\nCheating, robbing, breaking promises—these three are clearly things\r\nwhich must cease to be done. One more thing, also, and that is the\r\nrefusal of the protection of the law to the Indian's rights of property,\r\n\"of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\r\n\r\nWhen these four things have ceased to be done, time, statesmanship,\r\nphilanthropy, and Christianity can slowly and surely do the rest. Till\r\nthese four things have ceased to be done, statesmanship and philanthropy\r\nalike must work in vain, and even Christianity can reap but small\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\n                        THE SAND CREEK MASSACRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letters were printed in the _New York Tribune_ in the\r\nwinter of 1879. They are of interest, not only as giving a minute\r\naccount of one of the most atrocious massacres ever perpetrated, but\r\nalso as showing the sense of justice which is to be found in the\r\nfrontiersman's mind to-day. That men, exasperated by atrocities and\r\noutrages, should have avenged themselves with hot haste and cruelty,\r\nwas, perhaps, only human; but that men should be found, fifteen years\r\nlater, apologizing for, nay, justifying the cruel deed, is indeed a\r\nmatter of marvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER I.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1864, Governor Evans, of Colorado, sent out a circular to the\r\nIndians of the Plains, inviting all friendly Indians to come into the\r\nneighborhood of the forts, and be protected by the United States troops.\r\nHostilities and depredations had been committed by some bands of\r\nIndians, and the Government was about to make war upon them. This\r\ncircular says:\r\n\r\n\"In some instances they (the Indians) have attacked and killed soldiers,\r\nand murdered peaceable citizens. For this the Great Father is angry, and\r\nwill certainly hunt them out and punish them; but he does not want to\r\ninjure those who remain friendly to the whites. He desires to protect\r\nand take care of them. For this purpose I direct that all friendly\r\nIndians keep away from those who are at war, and go to places of safety.\r\nFriendly Arapahoes and Cheyennes belonging to the Arkansas River will go\r\nto Major Colby, United States Agent at Fort Lyon, who will give them\r\nprovisions and show them a place of safety.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this proclamation of the governor, a band of\r\nCheyennes, several hundred in number, came in and settled down near Fort\r\nLyon. After a time they were requested to move to Sand Creek, about\r\nforty miles from Fort Lyon, where they were still guaranteed \"perfect\r\nsafety\" and the protection of the Government. Rations of food were\r\nissued to them from time to time. On the 27th of November, Colonel J. M.\r\nChivington, a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Denver, and\r\nColonel of the First Colorado Cavalry, led his regiment by a forced\r\nmarch to Fort Lyon, induced some of the United States troops to join\r\nhim, and fell upon this camp of friendly Indians at daybreak. The chief,\r\nWhite Antelope, always known as friendly to the whites, came running\r\ntoward the soldiers, holding up his hands and crying \"Stop! stop!\" in\r\nEnglish. When he saw that there was no mistake, that it was a deliberate\r\nattack, he folded his arms and waited till he was shot down. The United\r\nStates flag was floating over the lodge of Black Kettle, the head chief\r\nof the tribe; below it was tied also a small white flag as additional\r\nsecurity—a precaution Black Kettle had been advised by United States\r\nofficers to take if he met troops on the Plains. In Major Wynkoop's\r\ntestimony, given before the committee appointed by Congress to\r\ninvestigate this massacre, is the following passage:\r\n\r\n\"Women and children were killed and scalped, children shot at their\r\nmothers' breasts, and all the bodies mutilated in the most horrible\r\nmanner. *** The dead bodies of females profaned in such a manner that\r\nthe recital is sickening, Colonel J. M. Chivington all the time inciting\r\nhis troops to their diabolical outrages.\"\r\n\r\nAnother man testified as to what he saw on the 30th of November, three\r\ndays after the battle, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I saw a man dismount from his horse and cut the ear from the body of an\r\nIndian, and the scalp from the head of another. I saw a number of\r\nchildren killed; they had bullet-holes in them; one child had been cut\r\nwith some sharp instrument across its side. I saw another that both ears\r\nhad been cut off. *** I saw several of the Third Regiment cut off\r\nfingers to get the rings off them. I saw Major Sayre scalp a dead\r\nIndian. The scalp had a long tail of silver hanging to it.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Bent testified:\r\n\r\n\"I saw one squaw lying on the bank, whose leg had been broken. A soldier\r\ncame up to her with a drawn sabre. She raised her arm to protect\r\nherself; he struck, breaking her arm. She rolled over, and raised her\r\nother arm; he struck, breaking that, and then left her without killing\r\nher. I saw one squaw cut open, with an unborn child lying by her side.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Anthony testified:\r\n\r\n\"There was one little child, probably three years old, just big enough\r\nto walk through the sand. The Indians had gone ahead, and this little\r\nchild was behind, following after them. The little fellow was perfectly\r\nnaked, travelling in the sand. I saw one man get off his horse at a\r\ndistance of about seventy-five yards and draw up his rifle and fire. He\r\nmissed the child. Another man came up and said, 'Let me try the son of a\r\nb——. I can hit him.' He got down off his horse, kneeled down, and fired\r\nat the little child, but he missed him. A third man came up, and made a\r\nsimilar remark, and fired, and the little fellow dropped.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians were not able to make much resistance, as only a part of\r\nthem were armed, the United States officers having required them to give\r\nup their guns. Luckily they had kept a few.\r\n\r\nWhen this Colorado regiment of demons returned to Denver they were\r\ngreeted with an ovation. _The Denver News_ said: \"All acquitted\r\nthemselves well. Colorado soldiers have again covered themselves with\r\nglory;\" and at a theatrical performance given in the city, these scalps\r\ntaken from Indians were held up and exhibited to the audience, which\r\napplauded rapturously.\r\n\r\nAfter listening, day after day, to such testimonies as these I have\r\nquoted, and others so much worse that I may not write and _The Tribune_\r\ncould not print the words needful to tell them, the committee reported:\r\n\"It is difficult to believe that beings in the form of men, and\r\ndisgracing the uniform of United States soldiers and officers, could\r\ncommit or countenance the commission of such acts of cruelty and\r\nbarbarity;\" and of Colonel Chivington: \"He deliberately planned and\r\nexecuted a foul and dastardly massacre, which would have disgraced the\r\nveriest savage among those who were the victims of his cruelty.\"\r\n\r\nThis was just fifteen years ago, no more. Shall we apply the same rule\r\nof judgment to the white men of Colorado that the Government is now\r\napplying to the Utes? There are 130,000 inhabitants of Colorado;\r\nhundreds of them had a hand in this massacre, and thousands in cool\r\nblood applauded it when it was done. There are 4000 Utes in Colorado.\r\nTwelve of them, desperate, guilty men, have committed murder and rape,\r\nand three or four hundred of them did, in the convenient phrase of our\r\ndiplomacy, \"go to war against the Government;\" _i.e._, they attempted,\r\nby force of arms, to restrain the entrance upon their own lands—lands\r\nbought, owned and paid for—of soldiers that the Government had sent\r\nthere, to be ready to make way upon them, in case the agent thought it\r\nbest to do so! This is the plain English of it. This is the plain, naked\r\ntruth of it.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Secretary of the Interior has stopped the issue of rations\r\nto 1000 of these helpless creatures; rations, be it understood, which\r\nare not, and never were, a charity, but are the Utes' rightful dues, on\r\naccount of lands by them sold; dues which the Government promised to pay\r\n\"annually forever.\" Will the American people justify this? There is such\r\na thing as the conscience of a nation—as a nation's sense of justice.\r\nCan it not be roused to speak now? Shall we sit still, warm and well\r\nfed, in our homes, while five hundred women and little children are\r\nbeing slowly starved in the bleak, barren wildernesses of Colorado?\r\nStarved, not because storm, or blight, or drouth has visited their\r\ncountry and cut off their crops; not because pestilence has laid its\r\nhand on them and slain the hunters who brought them meat, but because it\r\nlies within the promise of one man, by one word, to deprive them of\r\none-half their necessary food for as long a term of years as he may\r\nplease; and \"the Secretary of the Interior cannot consistently feed a\r\ntribe that has gone to war against the Government.\"\r\n\r\nWe read in the statutes of the United States that certain things may be\r\ndone by \"executive order\" of the President. Is it not time for a\r\nPresident to interfere when hundreds of women and children are being\r\nstarved in his Republic by the order of one man? Colonel J. M.\r\nChivington's method was less inhuman by far. To be shot dead is a mercy,\r\nand a grace for which we would all sue, if to be starved to death were\r\nour only other alternative.\r\n\r\n                                                                   H. H.\r\n\r\nNew York, Jan 31st, 1880.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis letter drew from the former editor of the _Rocky Mountain News_, a\r\nDenver newspaper, the following reply:\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\n                    _To the Editor of the Tribune_:\r\n\r\nSIR,—In your edition of yesterday appears an article, under the above\r\ncaption, which arraigns the people of Colorado as a community of\r\nbarbarous murderers, and finally elevates them above the present\r\nSecretary of the Interior, thereby placing the latter gentleman in a\r\nmost unenviable light if the charges averred be true. \"The Sand Creek\r\nMassacre\" of 1864 is made the text and burden of the article; its\r\napplication is to the present condition of the White River band of Utes\r\nin Colorado. Quotations are given from the testimony gathered, and the\r\nreport made thereon by a committee of Congress charged with a so-called\r\ninvestigation of the Sand Creek affair. That investigation was made for\r\na certain selfish purpose. It was to break down and ruin certain men.\r\nEvidence was taken upon one side only. It was largely false, and\r\ninfamously partial. There was no answer for the defence.\r\n\r\nThe Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians assembled at Sand Creek were not under\r\nthe protection of a United States fort. A few of them had been encamped\r\nabout Fort Lyon and drawing supplies therefrom, but they had gradually\r\ndisappeared and joined the main camp on Dry Sandy, forty miles from the\r\nfort, separated from it by a waterless desert, and entirely beyond the\r\nlimit of its control or observation. While some of the occupants were\r\nstill, no doubt, occasional visitors at the fort, and applicants for\r\nsupplies and ammunition, most of the warriors were engaged in raiding\r\nthe great Platte River Road, seventy-five miles farther north, robbing\r\nand burning trains, stealing cattle and horses, robbing and destroying\r\nthe United States mails, and killing white people. During the summer and\r\nfall they had murdered over fifty of the citizens of Colorado. They had\r\nstolen and destroyed provisions and merchandise, and driven away stock\r\nworth hundreds of thousands of dollars. They had interrupted the mails,\r\nand for thirty-two consecutive days none were allowed to pass their\r\nlines. When satiated with murder and arson, and loaded with plunder,\r\nthey would retire to their sacred refuge on Sand Creek to rest and\r\nrefresh themselves, recruit their wasted supplies of ammunition from\r\nFort Lyon—begged under the garb of gentle, peaceful savages—and then\r\nreturn to the road to relieve their tired comrades, and riot again in\r\ncarnage and robbery. These are facts; and when the \"robbers' roost\" was\r\ncleaned out, on that sad but glorious 27th day of November, 1864, they\r\nwere sufficiently proven. Scalps of white men not yet dried; letters and\r\nphotographs stolen from the mails; bills of lading and invoices of\r\ngoods; bales and bolts of the goods themselves, addressed to merchants\r\nin Denver; half-worn clothing of white women and children, and many\r\nother articles of like character, were found in that poetical Indian\r\ncamp, and recovered by the Colorado soldiers. They were brought to\r\nDenver, and those were the scalps exhibited in the theatre of that city.\r\nThere was also an Indian saddle-blanket entirely fringed around the\r\nedges with white women's scalps, with the long, fair hair attached.\r\nThere was an Indian saddle over the pommel of which was stretched skin\r\nstripped from the body of a white woman. Is it any wonder that soldiers\r\nflushed with victory, after one of the hardest campaigns ever endured by\r\nmen, should indulge—some of them—in unwarranted atrocities after finding\r\nsuch evidence of barbarism, and while more than forty of their comrades\r\nwere weltering in their own blood upon the field?\r\n\r\nIf \"H. H.\" had been in Denver in the early part of that summer, when the\r\nbloated, festering bodies of the Hungate family—father, mother, and two\r\nbabes—were drawn through the streets naked in an ox-wagon, cut,\r\nmutilated, and scalped—the work of those same red fiends who were so\r\njustly punished at Sand Creek; if, later, \"H. H.\" had seen an upright\r\nand most estimable business man go crazy over the news of his son's\r\nbeing tortured to death a hundred miles down the Platte, as I did; if\r\n\"H. H.\" had seen one-half the Colorado homes made desolate that fateful\r\nseason, and a tithe of the tears that were caused to flow, I think there\r\nwould have been one little word of excuse for the people of\r\nColorado—more than a doubtful comparison with an inefficient and\r\nculpable Indian policy. Bear in mind that Colorado had no railroads\r\nthen. Her supplies reached her by only one road—along the Platte—in\r\nwagons drawn by oxen, mules, or horses. That line was in full possession\r\nof the enemy. Starvation stared us in the face. Hardly a party went or\r\ncame without some persons being killed. In some instances whole trains\r\nwere cut off and destroyed. Sand Creek saved Colorado, and taught the\r\nIndians the most salutary lesson they had ever learned. And now, after\r\nfifteen years, and here in the shadow of the Nation's Capitol, with the\r\nspectre of \"H. H.'s\" condemnation staring me in the face, I am neither\r\nafraid nor ashamed to repeat the language then used by _The Denver\r\nNews_: \"All acquitted themselves well. Colorado soldiers have again\r\ncovered themselves with glory.\"\r\n\r\nThus much of history is gone over by \"H. H.\" to present in true dramatic\r\nform the deplorable condition of the White River Utes, 1000 in number,\r\nwho are now suffering the pangs of hunger and the discomfort of cold in\r\nthe wilds of Western Colorado, without any kind agent to issue rations,\r\nprovide blankets, or build fires for them. It is really too bad. A\r\npainful dispensation of Providence has deprived them of their best\r\nfriend, and they are desolate and bereaved. He placed his life and its\r\nbest efforts, his unbounded enthusiasm for their good, his great\r\nChristian heart—all at their service. But an accident befell him, and he\r\nis no more. The coroner's jury that sat upon his remains found that his\r\ndead body had a barrel stave driven into his mouth, a log-chain around\r\nhis neck, by which it had been dragged about like a dead hog, and sundry\r\nbullet-holes through his body. The presumption was that from the effect\r\nof some one of these accidents he died; and, alas! he is no longer to\r\nserve out weekly rations to his flock of gentle Utes. There is no sorrow\r\nover his death or the desolation it wrought, but there is pity, oceans\r\nof pity, for the Indians who are hungry and cold. True, at the time he\r\ndied they took the flour, the pork, and salt, and coffee, and sugar, and\r\ntobacco, and blankets, and all the other supplies that he would have\r\nissued to them through all this long winter had he lived. With his care\r\nthese would have lasted until spring, and been sufficient for their\r\nwants; but, without it, \"H. H.\" is suspicious that they are all gone,\r\nand yet it is but just past the middle of winter. Can \"H. H.\" tell why\r\nthis is thus? It is also true that they drove away the large herd of\r\ncattle from the increase of which that same unfortunate agent and his\r\npredecessors had supplied them with beef for eleven years past, and yet\r\nthe consumption did not keep pace with the natural increase. They took\r\nthem all, and are presumed to have them now. True, again, they had at\r\nthe beginning of winter, or at the period of the melancholy loss of\r\ntheir best friend, about 4000 horses that were rolling fat, and three\r\nacres of dogs—not bad food in an emergency, or for an Indian\r\nthanksgiving feast—some of which should still remain.\r\n\r\nTHE WHOLE WHITE RIVER BAND GUILTY.\r\n\r\nBut \"H. H.\" intimates that there is an alleged excuse for withholding\r\nrations from these poor, persecuted red angels. \"Twelve\" of them have\r\nbeen bad, and the tyrant at the head of the Interior Department is\r\nsystematically starving all of the 1000 who constitute the band, and\r\ntheir 4000 horses, and 1800 cattle, and three acres of dogs, and six\r\nmonths' supplies, because those twelve bad Indians cannot\r\nconscientiously pick themselves out and be offered up as a\r\nburnt-offering and a sacrifice to appease the wrath of an outraged and\r\npartly civilized nation. This is the present indictment, and the\r\nSecretary and the President are commanded to stand up and plead \"Guilty\r\nor not guilty, but you know you are guilty, d—n you.\" Now I challenge\r\nand defy \"H. H.,\" or any other person living, to pick out or name twelve\r\nWhite River male Utes, over sixteen years of age, who were _not_ guilty,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, as principals or accomplices before the fact, in\r\nthe Thornburgh attack or in the Agency massacre. I know these Indians\r\nwell enough to know that these attacks were perfectly understood and\r\ndeliberately planned. I cannot be made to believe that a single one of\r\nthem, of common-sense and intelligence, was ignorant of what was to take\r\nplace, and that knowledge extended far beyond the White River band.\r\nThere were plenty of recruits from both the Los Pinos and the Uintah\r\nbands. In withholding supplies from the White River Utes the Secretary\r\nof the Interior is simply obeying the law. He cannot, except upon his\r\nown personal responsibility, issue supplies to a hostile Indian tribe,\r\nand the country will hold him accountable for a departure from his line\r\nof duty. Inferentially the Indians are justified by \"H. H.\" in their\r\nattack upon Thornburgh's command. Their object was to defend \"their own\r\nlands—lands bought, owned, and paid for.\" Bought of whom, pray? Paid for\r\nby whom? To whom was payment made? The soldiers were making no attack;\r\nthey contemplated none. The agent had no authority to order an attack.\r\nHe could not proclaim war. He could have no control whatever over the\r\ntroops. But his life was in danger. The honor of his family was at\r\nstake. He asked for protection. \"H. H.\" says he had no right to it. His\r\nlife and the honor of his aged wife and of his virgin daughter are gone,\r\nand \"H. H.\" is the champion of fiends who wrought the ruin.\r\n\r\n                                                           WM. N. BYERS.\r\n\r\nWashington, D.

The writer of this letter says:\r\n\r\n\"The Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians assembled at Sand Creek were not\r\nunder the protection of a United States fort.\"\r\n\r\nThe following testimony is that of Lieutenant Craven, Senate Document,\r\nvol. ii., 1866-67, p. 46:\r\n\r\n\"I had some conversation with Major Downing, Lieutenant Maynard, and\r\nColonel Chivington. I stated to them my feelings in regard to the\r\nmatter—that I believed it to be murder—and stated the obligations that\r\nwe of Major Wynkoop's command were under to those Indians.\r\n\r\n\"To Colonel Chivington I know I stated that Major Wynkoop had pledged\r\nhis word as an officer and man to those Indians, and that all officers\r\nunder him were indirectly pledged in the same manner that he was, and\r\nthat I felt that it was placing us in very embarrassing circumstances to\r\nfight the same Indians that had saved our lives, as we all felt that\r\nthey had.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Chivington's reply was that he believed it to be right and\r\nhonorable to use any means under God's heaven to kill Indians that would\r\nkill women and children; and, 'damn any one that was in sympathy with\r\nIndians;' and, 'such men as Major Wynkoop and myself had better get out\r\nof the United States service.'\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation was testified to by other witnesses. Major Wynkoop, it\r\nwill be remembered, was the officer in command at Fort Lyon when this\r\nband of Cheyennes and Arapahoes came in there to claim protection, in\r\nconsequence of the governor's proclamation, saying that,\r\n\r\n\"All friendly Arapahoes and Cheyennes, belonging on the Arkansas River,\r\nwill go to Major Colby, United States Indian Agent at Fort Lyon, who\r\nwill give them provisions and show them a place of safety.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Wynkoop was succeeded in the command of Fort Lyon by Major\r\nAnthony, who continued for a time to issue rations to these Indians, as\r\nMajor Wynkoop had done; but after a time he called them together and\r\ntold them he could not feed them any longer; they would better go where\r\nthey could hunt. _He selected the place to which they were to move on\r\nSandy Creek._ They obeyed, and he gave back to them some of the arms\r\nwhich had been taken away. They were moved to Sandy Creek, about forty\r\nmiles from Fort Lyon, partly \"for fear of some conflict between them and\r\nthe soldiers or emigrants,\" Fort Lyon being on a thoroughfare of travel.\r\nOne of the chiefs—One Eye—was hired by Major Anthony at $125 a month \"to\r\nobtain information for the use of the military authorities. Several\r\ntimes he brought news to the fort of proposed movements of hostile\r\nIndians.\" This chief was killed in the massacre.\r\n\r\nThis is the testimony of Captain Soule, First Colorado Cavalry:\r\n\r\n\"Did you protest against attacking those Indians?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was your commanding officer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Major Anthony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you inform Major Anthony of the relations existing with Black\r\nKettle?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did. He knew the relations. I frequently talked to him about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What answer did Major Anthony make to your protests?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that we were going to fight the hostile Indians at Smoky Hill.\r\nHe also said that he was in for killing all Indians, and that he had\r\nonly been acting friendly with them until he could get a force large\r\nenough to go out and kill all of them.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the testimony of S. E. Brown:\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Chivington in a public speech said his policy was to kill and\r\nscalp all, little and big: nits made lice.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Hunt testified as follows: [Governor Hunt was one of the\r\nearliest settlers in Colorado. He was United States Marshal, Delegate to\r\nCongress, and afterward Governor of the Territory.]\r\n\r\n\"We have always regarded Black Kettle and White Antelope as the special\r\nfriends of the white man ever since I have been in this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know of any acts of hostility committed by them or with their\r\nconsent?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear any acts of hostility attributed to them by any one?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\" ***\r\n\r\nThe following extract is:\r\n\r\n\"The regiment, when they marched into Denver, exhibited Indian scalps.\"\r\n\r\nThis is from the official report of Major Wynkoop, major commanding Fort\r\nLyon.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, allow me to say that, from the time I held the\r\nconsultation with the Indian chiefs on the head-waters of Smoky Hill up\r\nto the date of this massacre by Colonel Chivington, not one single\r\ndepredation had been committed by the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians. The\r\nsettlers of the Arkansas Valley had returned to their ranches, from\r\nwhich they had fled, had taken in their crops, and had been resting in\r\nperfect security under assurances from myself that they would be in no\r\ndanger for the present. Since this last horrible murder by Colonel\r\nChivington the country presents a scene of desolation. All communication\r\nis cut off with the States, except by sending large bodies of troops,\r\nand already over a hundred whites have fallen victims to the fearful\r\nvengeance of these betrayed Indians.\"\r\n\r\n                                                     January 15th, 1865.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe writer of this letter says, in regard to the investigation of the\r\nSand Creek massacre by the Congressional committee, that \"evidence was\r\ntaken upon one side only,\" and \"there was no answer for the defence.\"\r\n\r\nA large part of the testimony is sworn evidence, given by the Governor\r\nof Colorado, by Colonel J. M. Chivington himself, who planned and\r\nexecuted the massacre, and by Major Anthony, who accompanied him with\r\ntroops from Fort Lyon. The writer of this article says that \"the\r\ninvestigation was made for a certain selfish purpose, *** to break down\r\nand ruin certain men.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of Senator Foster, Senator Doolittle, and \"honest Ben Wade\r\n\"are the best refutation of this statement. It will be hard to impeach\r\nthe trustworthiness of reports signed by these names, and one of these\r\nreports says:\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to believe that beings in the form of men, and\r\ndisgracing the uniform of United States soldiers and officers, could\r\ncommit or countenance the commission of such acts of cruelty and\r\nbarbarity.\"\r\n\r\nOf Colonel Chivington, it says:\r\n\r\n\"He deliberately planned and executed a foul and dastardly massacre,\r\nwhich would have disgraced the veriest savage among those who were the\r\nvictims of his cruelty.\"\r\n\r\nAnd of Major Anthony:\r\n\r\n\"The testimony of Major Anthony, who succeeded an officer disposed to\r\ntreat these Indians with justice and humanity, is sufficient of itself\r\nto show how unprovoked and unwarranted was this massacre. He testifies\r\nthat he found these Indians camped near Fort Lyon when he assumed\r\ncommand of that fort; that they professed their friendliness to the\r\nwhites, and their willingness to do whatever he demanded of them; that\r\nthey delivered their arms up to him; that they went to and encamped on\r\nthe place designated by him; that they gave him information from time to\r\ntime of acts of hostility which were meditated by other hostile bands,\r\nand in every way conducted themselves properly and peaceably; and yet he\r\nsays it was fear and not principle which prevented his killing them\r\nwhile they were completely in his power; and, when Colonel Chivington\r\nappeared at Fort Lyon on his mission of murder and barbarity, Major\r\nAnthony made haste to accompany him with men and artillery.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer of this letter says that the evidence given in this\r\n\"so-called investigation\" was \"largely false and infamously partial.\" If\r\nthis were the case, why did not all persons so \"infamously\" slandered\r\nsee to it that before the year ended their own version of the affair\r\nshould reach, if not the general public, at least the Department of the\r\nInterior? Why did they leave it possible for the Secretary of the\r\nInterior to incorporate in his Annual Report for 1865—to be read by all\r\nthe American people—these paragraphs?\r\n\r\n\"No official account has ever reached this office from its own proper\r\nsources of the most disastrous and shameful occurrence, the massacre of\r\na large number of men, women, and children of the Indians of this agency\r\n(the Upper Arkansas) by the troops under the command of Colonel\r\nChivington of the United States Volunteer Cavalry of Colorado. ***\r\n\r\n\"When several hundred of them had come into a place designated by\r\nGovernor Evans as a rendezvous for those who would separate themselves\r\nfrom the hostile parties, these Indians were set upon and butchered in\r\ncold blood by troops in the service of the United States. The few who\r\nescaped to the northward told a story which effectually prevented any\r\nmore advances toward peace by such of the bands as were well disposed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd why did the Government of the United States empower General Sanborn,\r\nin the Council held October 12th, 1865, with the Arapahoes and\r\nCheyennes, including the remnants of bands that had escaped from the\r\nSand Creek massacre, to formally and officially repudiate the action of\r\nthe United States soldiers in that massacre? General Sanborn said, in\r\nthis council:\r\n\r\n\"We all feel disgraced and ashamed when we see our officers or soldiers\r\noppressing the weak, or making war on those who are at peace with us.\r\n*** We are willing, as representatives of the President, to restore all\r\nthe property lost at Sand Creek, or its value. *** He has sent out his\r\ncommissioners to make reparation, as far as we can. *** So heartily do\r\nwe repudiate the actions of our soldiers that we are willing to give to\r\nthe chiefs in their own right 320 acres of land each, to hold as his own\r\nforever, and to each of the children and squaws who lost husbands or\r\nparents; we are also willing to give 160 acres of land as their own, to\r\nkeep as long as they live.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer of this letter, quoting the statement from a previous article\r\nin _The Tribune_, that the White River Utes, in their attack on Major\r\nThornburgh's command, fought \"to defend their own lands—lands bought,\r\nowned, and paid for,\" asks:\r\n\r\n\"Bought of whom, pray? Paid for by whom? To whom was payment made?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bought\" of the United States Government, thereby recognizing the United\r\nStates Government's right to \"the sovereignty of the soil\" as superior\r\nto the Indians' \"right of occupancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paid for\" by the Ute Indians, by repeated \"relinquishments\" of said\r\n\"right of occupancy\" in large tracts of valuable lands; notably by the\r\n\"relinquishment,\" according to the Brunot Treaty of 1873, of 4,000,000\r\nacres of valuable lands, \"unquestionably rich in mineral\r\ndeposits.\"—_Annual Report of the Secretary of the Interior for 1873_, p.\r\n464.\r\n\r\n\"To whom was payment made?\"\r\n\r\nTo the United States Government, which has accepted and ratified such\r\nexchanges of \"right of occupancy\" for \"right of sovereignty,\" and such\r\nsales of \"right of occupancy\" for large sums of money by repeated and\r\nreiterated treaties.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior has incorporated in his Annual Report for\r\n1879 (in the report on Indian Affairs, p. 36) the following paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\"Let it be fully understood that the Ute Indians have a good and\r\nsufficient title to 12,000,000 acres of land in Colorado, and that these\r\nIndians did not thrust themselves in the way of the white people, but\r\nthat they were originally and rightfully possessors of the soil, and\r\nthat the land they occupy has been acknowledged to be theirs by solemn\r\ntreaties made with them by the United States.\r\n\r\n\"It will not do to say that a treaty with an Indian means nothing. It\r\nmeans even more than the pledge of the Government to pay a bond. It is\r\nthe most solemn declaration that any government of any people ever\r\nenters into. Neither will it do to say that treaties never ought to have\r\nbeen made with Indians. That question is now not in order, as the\r\ntreaties have been made, and must be lived up to whether convenient or\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\"By beginning at the outset with the full acknowledgment of the absolute\r\nand indefeasible right of these Indians to 12,000,000 acres in Colorado,\r\nwe can properly consider what is the best method of extinguishing the\r\nIndian title thereto without injustice to the Indians, and without\r\nviolating the plighted faith of the Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer of this letter says:\r\n\r\n\"In withholding supplies from the White River Utes, the Secretary of the\r\nInterior is simply obeying the law. He cannot, except upon his own\r\npersonal responsibility, issue supplies to a hostile Indian tribe.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Schurz has published, in the Annual Report of the Department\r\nof the Interior for 1879, the following paragraph in regard to this case\r\nof the White River Utes:\r\n\r\n\"The atrocity of the crimes committed should not prevent those\r\nindividuals who are innocent from being treated as such, according to\r\nArticle 17 of the treaty, viz.: _Provided_, that if any chief of either\r\nof the confederated bands make war against the United States, or in any\r\nmanner violate this treaty in any essential part, said chief shall\r\nforfeit his position as chief, and all rights to any of the benefits of\r\nthis treaty; but, _provided further_, any Indian of either of these\r\nconfederated bands who shall remain at peace, and abide by the terms of\r\nthis treaty in all its essentials, shall be entitled to its benefits and\r\nprovisions, notwithstanding his particular chief and band have forfeited\r\ntheir rights thereto.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer of this letter says, in allusion to the murders and outrages\r\ncommitted by some of the White River Utes, that \"H. H. is the champion\r\nof the fiends who wrought the ruin.\" Have the readers of _The Tribune_\r\nso understood my protests against the injustice of punishing the\r\ninnocent for the crimes of the guilty?\r\n\r\n                                                                   H. H.\r\n\r\nNew York, Feb. 22d, 1880.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis letter was followed by a card from Mr. Byers, reiterating some of\r\nhis assertions; and by a second short letter, which closed the\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n                    _To the Editor of the Tribune_:\r\n\r\nSIR,—I ask only a little space for reference to the communication of \"H.\r\nH.\" in to-day's _Tribune_. It is asked, \"If the investigation of the\r\nSand Creek affair was so unfair, why did not the people of Colorado\r\ncorrect the false impression by presenting their own version of the\r\ncase?\" The answer is that the case was prejudged, and we were denied a\r\nhearing in our defence.\r\n\r\nThe inference is conveyed in to-day's article that Indian hostilities on\r\nthe plains were provoked by and followed after the Sand Creek massacre.\r\nWe, who were so unfortunate as to be citizens of Colorado at the time,\r\nknow that a very great majority of the savage atrocities of that period\r\noccurred before the battle of Sand Creek. We know that the Sand Creek\r\nIndian camp was the common rendezvous of the hostile bands who were\r\ncommitting those atrocities. We know that comparatively few occurred\r\nafterward. No amount of special pleading, no reiteration of partial\r\nstatements, and withholding of more important truths, will change the\r\nfacts so well known to the earlier settlers of Colorado.\r\n\r\nI deny that the Utes have either bought or paid for any land. They have\r\nrelinquished for a consideration a certain portion of the land they\r\nformerly claimed, and still retain the other portion. I deny, also, that\r\nonly twelve of the White River Utes are guilty and the great mass of\r\nthem innocent. The contrary is the fact.\r\n\r\n                                                           WM. N. BYERS.\r\n\r\nNew York, Feb. 24th, 1880.\r\n\r\n                    _To the Editor of the Tribune_:\r\n\r\nSIR,—In reply to the assertion that the perpetrators of the Sand Creek\r\nmassacre were \"denied a hearing in their defence,\" I wish to state to\r\nthe readers of _The Tribune_ that, in addition to the Congressional\r\ncommittees from whose reports I have already quoted, there was appointed\r\na Military Commission to investigate that massacre. This commission sat\r\nseventy-three days, in Denver and at Fort Lyon. Colonel J. M. Chivington\r\ncalled before it, in his \"defence,\" all the witnesses he chose, and gave\r\nnotice on the seventy-third day of the commission's sitting that he did\r\nnot \"wish to introduce any more witnesses for the defence.\" He also had\r\n(and used) the privilege of cross-examining every witness called by the\r\ncommission. The evidence given before this commission occupies over two\r\nhundred pages of Volume II., Senate Documents for 1866-'67.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the assertion that \"a great majority of the savage\r\natrocities of that period occurred before\" the massacre at Sand Creek,\r\nand that \"comparatively few occurred after,\" I will give to the readers\r\nof _The Tribune_ one extract from the report of the Indian Peace\r\nCommission of 1868. Alluding to the Sand Creek massacre, the report\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"It scarcely has its parallel in the records of Indian barbarity.\r\nFleeing women, holding up their hands and praying for mercy, were shot\r\ndown; infants were killed and scalped in derision; men were tortured and\r\nmutilated in a manner that would put to shame the savages of interior\r\nAfrica. No one will be astonished that a war ensued which cost the\r\nGovernment $30,000,000, and carried conflagration and death into the\r\nborder settlements. During the spring and summer of 1865 no less than\r\n8000 troops were withdrawn from the effective forces engaged in the\r\nRebellion to meet this Indian war.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners who made this report were N. J. Taylor, President; J.\r\nB. Henderson, John B. Sanborn, William T. Sherman, Lieutenant-general;\r\nWilliam S. Harvey, Brevet Major-general; Alfred H. Terry, Brevet\r\nMajor-general; C. C. Augur, Brevet Major-general; S. F. Tappan.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the assertion that the Utes have not \"either bought or paid\r\nfor any land,\" I will ask such of _The Tribune_ readers as are\r\ninterested in the subject to read the \"Brunot Treaty,\" made September\r\n13th, 1873, \"between Felix R. Brunot, Commissioner for the United\r\nStates, and the chiefs, headmen, and men\" of the seven confederated\r\nbands of Utes. It is to be found in the report of the Department of the\r\nInterior for 1873, p. 454.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion of the discussion as to the Sand Creek massacre, I will\r\nrelate one more incident of that terrible day. It has not been recorded\r\nin any of the reports. It was told in Colorado, to one of the members of\r\nthe Senate Committee at the time of their investigation: One of the\r\nsquaws had escaped from the village, and was crouching behind some low\r\nsage brush. A frightened horse came running toward her hiding-place, its\r\nowner in hot pursuit. Seeing that the horse was making directly for her\r\nshelter, and that she would inevitably be seen, and thinking that\r\npossibly if she caught the horse, and gave him back to the owner, she\r\nmight thus save her life, she ran after the horse, caught it, and stood\r\nholding it till the soldier came up. Remembering that with her blanket\r\nrolled tight around her she might possibly be taken for a man, as she\r\nput into the soldier's hand the horse's bridle, with the other hand she\r\nthrew open her blanket enough to show her bosom, that he might see that\r\nshe was a woman. He put the muzzle of his pistol between her breasts and\r\nshot her dead; and afterward was \"not ashamed\" to boast of the act. It\r\nwas by such deeds as this that \"the Colorado soldiers acquitted\r\nthemselves well, and covered themselves with glory.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                   H. H.\r\n\r\nNew York, Feb. 28th, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n                            THE PONCA CASE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from Treaty with the Poncas, giving them Dakota Lands._\r\n\r\n\"ART. II.—In consideration of the cession or release of that portion of\r\nthe reservation above described by the Ponca tribe of Indians to the\r\nGovernment of the United States, the Government of the United States, by\r\nway of rewarding them for their constant fidelity to the Government\r\nthereof, and with a view of returning to the said tribe of Ponca Indians\r\ntheir old burying-grounds and cornfields, hereby cede and relinquish to\r\nthe tribe of Ponca Indians the following described fractional townships,\r\nto wit, township thirty-one (31), north range, seven (7) west; also\r\nfractional township thirty-two (32), north ranges, six (6), seven (7),\r\neight (8), nine (9), and ten (10) west; also fractional township\r\nthirty-three (33), north ranges, seven (7) and eight (8) west; and also\r\nall that portion of township thirty-three (33), north ranges, nine (9)\r\nand ten (10) west, lying south of Ponca Creek; and also all the islands\r\nin the Niobrara or Running Water River lying in front of lands or\r\ntownships above ceded by the United States to the Ponca tribe of\r\nIndians.\"\r\n\r\nA correspondence which was held with the Secretary of the Interior in\r\nthe winter of 1879, in regard to the Poncas, is so excellent an\r\nillustration of the methods and policy of the Interior Department that\r\nit is worth while to give it at length here.\r\n\r\nFIRST LETTER.\r\n\r\nMRS. JACKSON TO SECRETARY SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n                                       New York, Friday, Jan. 9th, 1880.\r\n\r\n_To the Secretary of the Interior_:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,—I have received from a Boston lady a letter which has so\r\nimportant a bearing on the interests of the Poncas that I take the\r\nliberty of asking you to read and reply to the following extracts. I\r\nsend them to you with the writer's permission:\r\n\r\n\"In Boston most of those who are likely to give most largely and feel\r\nmost strongly for the Indians have confidence in Secretary Schurz. They\r\nthink that so far he has shown himself their friend, and they feel\r\nunprepared to help any plan with regard to the Indians which he opposes.\r\nThe greatest service which could be rendered to the Indian cause at\r\npresent would be given, therefore, by some one sufficiently interested\r\nto obtain an answer who would write to Secretary Schurz, and request\r\nhim, on the part of the Indians, either to aid them by publicly and\r\ncordially endorsing this effort of the Poncas to secure their legal\r\nrights in the courts, or else to give his reasons against this attempt,\r\nin so clear a form that one could understand them. If there are good\r\nreasons, there can be no ground for keeping them secret, and the public\r\nhas a right to know them. If not, no man can call himself a friend of\r\nthe Indians who throws cold water on the present interest of the public\r\nin this matter.\r\n\r\n\"Secretary Schurz has already stated that it was not worth while to sue\r\nfor the Ponca lands, as the Poncas are better off where they now are;\r\nbut Secretary Schurz cannot deny that it is worth ten times $10,000 to\r\nprove that if the Government seizes land given to the Indians forever by\r\nsolemn compact, the latter can by the courts recover it. Secretary\r\nSchurz has also said that a bill to give the Indians land in severalty\r\nis already before Congress. If he wishes that bill to pass he must know\r\nthat it is only by help of the people that the ignorance, apathy, and\r\ngreed which are accountable for the shameful record of the past can be\r\novercome; and that, whatever his sentiments toward these particular\r\nPoncas, he cannot afford to throw aside the interest they have excited.\r\n\r\n\"For a hundred years the Indians have been the victims of fraud and\r\noppression on the part of the Government. Will anything put an end to it\r\nbut to give the Indians the legal right to protect themselves? Promises\r\nand plans will not do it, for who can assure their performance?\r\nSecretary Schurz's position is a strange one, and the public are waiting\r\nand watching to see what it means. Is it possible that he is satisfied\r\nto have 250,000 human beings, with valuable possessions (however\r\nuncivilized), held as absolute slaves, with no rights, and at the mercy\r\nof a government like ours, whose constant changes, to say the least,\r\nrender most improbable the wise, equitable, and humane treatment he\r\nrecommends in his report—and when the distance of the Indian from the\r\npersonal interests of all but those States which have a personal\r\ninterest in possessing his lands makes the assistance of Congress in\r\nsuch treatment still more unlikely? I cannot but believe that he has\r\nallowed himself to be driven into an opposition he does not really feel;\r\nand that he will yet have the magnanimity to forget any criticism on his\r\nown acts, and take the lead with those who would try to give the Indians\r\na permanent defence against the vicissitudes of party and the greed of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\"I will not forget to add that if the three thousand and odd hundreds of\r\ndollars needed to complete the ten thousand required to pay the costs of\r\nthe Ponca suits cannot be raised in the great city of New York, I will\r\nmyself guarantee to raise it in Boston in twenty-four hours if Secretary\r\nSchurz will openly endorse the plan.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter stands, therefore, in this shape: If you can say that you\r\napprove of the Poncas bringing the suits they wish to bring for the\r\nrecovery of their lands, all the money for which they ask can be placed\r\nin their hands immediately. The writer of the above letter assured me\r\nthat she would herself give the entire sum if there were any difficulty\r\nin raising it. If you do not approve of the Poncas bringing these suits,\r\nor making an effort to bring them, are you willing to give the reasons\r\nof your disapproval? It would be a great satisfaction to those Boston\r\nfriends of yours whose action in this matter turns solely on your\r\ndecision, if these reasons could be stated in clear and explicit form.\r\n\r\n                          Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                          HELEN JACKSON.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY SCHURZ TO MRS. JACKSON.\r\n\r\n Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary, Jan. 17th, 1880.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,—I should certainly have answered your letter of the 9th\r\ninstant more promptly had I not been somewhat overburdened with official\r\nbusiness during the past week. I hope you will kindly pardon the\r\ninvoluntary delay.\r\n\r\nAs I understand the matter, money is being collected for the purpose of\r\nengaging counsel to appear for the Poncas in the courts of the United\r\nStates, partly to represent them in the case of an appeal from Judge\r\nDundy's _habeas corpus_ decision, and partly to procure a decision for\r\nthe recovery of their old reservation on the Missouri River. I believe\r\nthat the collection of money for these purposes is useless. An appeal\r\nfrom Judge Dundy's _habeas corpus_ decision can proceed only from the\r\nGovernment, not from the Poncas, for the simple reason that the decision\r\nwas in favor of the latter. An appeal was, indeed, entered by the United\r\nStates District-attorney at Omaha immediately after the decision had\r\nbeen announced. Some time ago his brief was submitted to me. On\r\nexamining it, I concluded at once to advise the attorney-general of my\r\nopinion that it should be dropped, as I could not approve the principles\r\nupon which the argument was based. The attorney-general consented to\r\ninstruct the district-attorney accordingly, and thus Judge Dundy's\r\ndecision stands without further question on the part of the Government.\r\nHad an appeal been prosecuted, and had Judge Dundy's decision been\r\nsustained by the court above, the general principles involved in it\r\nwould simply have been affirmed without any other practical effect than\r\nthat already obtained. This matter is therefore ended.\r\n\r\nAs to the right of the Poncas to their old reservation on the Missouri,\r\nthe Supreme Court has repeatedly decided that an Indian tribe cannot sue\r\nthe United States or a State in the federal courts. The decisions are\r\nclear and uniform on this point. Among lawyers with whom I discussed\r\nthis matter, I have not found a single one who entertained a different\r\nview; but I did find among them serious doubts as to whether a decision,\r\neven if the Poncas could bring suits, would be in their favor,\r\nconsidering the facts in the case. But, inasmuch as such a suit cannot\r\nbe brought at all, this is not the question. It is evidently idle to\r\ncollect money and to fee attorneys for the purpose of doing a thing\r\nwhich cannot be done. Had the disinterested friends of the Indians who\r\nare engaged in this work first consulted lawyers on the question of\r\npossibility, they would no doubt have come to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe study I have given to the Indian question in its various aspects,\r\npast and present, has produced in my mind the firm conviction that the\r\nonly certain way to secure the Indians in their possessions, and to\r\nprevent them from becoming forever a race of homeless paupers and\r\nvagabonds, is to transform their tribal title into individual title,\r\ninalienable for a certain period; in other words, to settle them in\r\nseveralty, and give them by patent an individual fee-simple in their\r\nlands. Then they will hold their lands by the same title by which white\r\nmen hold theirs, and they will, as a matter of course, have the same\r\nstanding in the courts, and the same legal protection of their property.\r\nAs long as they hold large tracts in the shape of reservations, only\r\nsmall parts of which they can make useful to themselves and to others,\r\nthe whole being held by the tribe in common, their tenure will always be\r\ninsecure. It will grow more and more so as our population increases, and\r\nthe quantity of available land diminishes. We may call this an ugly and\r\ndeplorable fact, but it is a fact for all that. Long experience shows\r\nthat the protests of good people in the name of justice and humanity\r\nhave availed but very little against this tendency, and it is useless to\r\ndisguise and unwise to overlook it, if we mean to do a real service to\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I attach much more importance to the passage of\r\nlegislation providing for the settlement of the Indians in severalty,\r\nand giving them individual title in fee-simple, the residue of their\r\nlands not occupied by them to be disposed of for their benefit, than to\r\nall the efforts, however well intended, to procure judicial decisions\r\nwhich, as I have shown, cannot be had. I am glad to say that the\r\nconversations I have had with senators and representatives in Congress\r\non the policy of settling the Indians in severalty have greatly\r\nencouraged my hope of the success of the \"severalty bill\" during the\r\npresent session.\r\n\r\nI need not repeat here what I said in a letter to Mr. Edward Atkinson,\r\nwhich you may possibly have seen some time ago in the Boston papers,\r\nabout the necessity of educating Indian children. You undoubtedly\r\nunderstand that as well as I do, and I hope you will concur in my\r\nrecommendation that the money collected for taking the Ponca case into\r\nthe courts, which is impossible of accomplishment, and as much more as\r\ncan be added, be devoted to the support and enlargement of our Indian\r\nschools, such as those at Hampton and Carlisle. Thus a movement which\r\nundoubtedly has the hearty sympathy of many good men and women, but\r\nwhich at present seems in danger of being wasted on the unattainable,\r\nmay be directed into a practical channel, and confer a real and lasting\r\nbenefit on the Indian race.\r\n\r\n                        Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                              C. SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nMrs. HELEN JACKSON, New York.\r\n\r\nMRS. JACKSON'S SECOND LETTER.\r\n\r\n                     Brevoort House, New York, Thursday, Jan. 22d, 1880.\r\n\r\n_Hon. Carl Schurz_:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,—Your letter of the 17th instant is at hand. If I understand\r\nthis letter correctly, the position which you take is as follows: That\r\nthere is in your opinion, and in the opinion of the lawyers whom you\r\nhave consulted on the subject, no way of bringing before the courts the\r\nsuits for the prosecution of which money has been and is being\r\ncontributed by the friends of the Poncas; that the reason you do not\r\napprove of this movement is that \"it is evidently idle to collect money\r\nand to fee attorneys for the purpose of doing a thing which cannot be\r\ndone.\" This is the sole reason which I understand you to give for\r\ndiscountenancing the collection of money for these suits. Am I correct\r\nin this? And are we to infer that it is on this ground and no other that\r\nyou oppose the collection of money for this purpose? Are we to\r\nunderstand that you would be in favor of the Poncas recovering their\r\nlands by process of law, provided it were practicable?\r\n\r\nYou say, also, that you hope I will \"concur\" in your \"recommendation\r\nthat the money collected for taking the Ponca case into the courts shall\r\nbe devoted to the support and enlargement of our Indian schools.\" May I\r\nask how it would be, in your opinion, possible to take money given by\r\nthousands of people for one specific purpose and use it for another\r\ndifferent purpose? You say, \"Had the friends of the Indians who are\r\nengaged in this work first consulted lawyers on the question of\r\npossibility, they would, no doubt, have come to the same conclusion.\"\r\nHad the friends of the Indians engaged in this work, and initiated this\r\nmovement without having consulted lawyers, it would have been indeed\r\nfoolish. But this was not the case. Lawyers of skill and standing were\r\nfound ready to undertake the case; and the matter stands therefore\r\nto-day precisely as it stood when I wrote to you on the 17th instant.\r\nAll the money which is thought to be needed for carrying the Ponca case\r\nbefore the courts can be raised in twenty-four hours in Boston, if you\r\ncan say that you approve of the suits being brought. If your only\r\nobjection to the movement is the one objection which you have stated,\r\nnamely, that it would be futile, can you not say that, if lawyers of\r\nstanding are ready to undertake the case, you would be glad to see the\r\nattempt made in the courts, and the question settled? If it is, as you\r\nthink, a futile effort, it will be shown to be so. If it is, as the\r\nfriends and lawyers of the Poncas think, a practicable thing, a great\r\nwrong will be righted.\r\n\r\nYou say that \"to settle them (the Indians) in severalty, and give them\r\nby patent an individual fee-simple in their lands,\" will enable them to\r\n\"hold their lands by the same title by which white men hold theirs,\" and\r\nthat \"then they will, as a matter of course, have the same standing in\r\nthe courts and the same legal protection of their property.\" May I ask\r\nyou if any bill has been brought before Congress which is so worded as\r\nto secure these ends? My only apology for troubling you again is my deep\r\ninterest in the Indians, and in the Ponca case especially.\r\n\r\n                              Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                          HELEN JACKSON.\r\n\r\nREPLY OF SECRETARY SCHURZ TO THE SECOND LETTER.\r\n\r\n                                      Washington, D.C., Jan. 26th, 1880.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,—In reply to your letter of the 22d instant, I beg leave to\r\nsay that if an Indian tribe could maintain an action in the courts of\r\nthe United States to assert its rights, I should object to it just as\r\nlittle as I would object to the exercise of the same privilege on the\r\npart of white men. What I do object to is the collection of money from\r\nphilanthropic and public-spirited persons, ostensibly for the benefit of\r\nthe Indians, but in fact for the benefit of attorneys and others who are\r\nto be paid for again testing a question which has been tested more than\r\nonce, and has been decided by the Supreme Court so clearly and\r\ncomprehensively that further testing seems utterly futile. You say that\r\nthere are lawyers of skill and standing ready to undertake the case. Of\r\ncourse there are such. You can find lawyers of skill and standing to\r\nundertake for a good fee any case, however hopeless: that is their\r\nbusiness. But I am by no means of your opinion that, whether it be\r\nfutile or not, the experiment should be tried once more, and for this\r\npurpose the collection of money should be further encouraged. It cannot\r\nbe said in this case that if the attempt will not help it will not hurt.\r\nThere seems to be now a genuine and active interest in the Indian\r\nquestion springing up. Many sincere friends of the Indian are willing to\r\nspend time and money for the promotion of their welfare. Such a movement\r\ncan do great good if wisely guided in the direction of attainable\r\nobjects; but if it be so conducted that it can result only in putting\r\nmoney into the pockets of private individuals, without any benefit to\r\nthe Indians, the collapse will be as hurtful as it seems to be\r\ninevitable. It will not only be apt to end a movement which, if well\r\ndirected, might have become very useful, but it will also deter the\r\nsincere friends of the Indians who contributed their means in the hope\r\nof accomplishing something from further efforts of that kind, so that we\r\nmay find it very difficult, for a long time at least, to engage this\r\nactive sympathy again. Confidence once abused does not revive very\r\nquickly. This is my view of the case. You ask me \"how it would be\r\npossible to take money given by thousands of people for one specific\r\npurpose, and use it for another and different purpose,\" meaning the\r\nsupport of Indian schools. It would, in my opinion, be far better to lay\r\nthe matter in its true aspect frankly before the contributors, and to\r\nask them for their consent to the change of purpose, than to throw away\r\nthe money for a purpose which cannot be accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn reply to your inquiry whether any bill has been brought before\r\nCongress providing for the settlement of the Indians in severalty, and\r\nfor conferring upon the individual title in fee-simple to the lands\r\nallotted to them, I am glad to say that several bills of this kind have\r\nbeen introduced in both the Senate and the House, and are now before the\r\nrespective committees on Indian affairs for consideration. If such a\r\nbill passes, of which there is great hope, the Indian, having a fee\r\ntitle by patent to the piece of land which he individually, not as a\r\nmember of a tribe, holds as his own, will stand in the eye of the law\r\njust like any other owner of property in his individual right, and, as a\r\nmatter of course, will have the same standing in court. This will do\r\nmore in securing the Indian in the practical enjoyment of his property\r\nthan anything else I can think of, and it has long been my endeavor to\r\nbring about just this result. I trust we shall obtain the desired\r\nlegislation during the present session of Congress.\r\n\r\n                        Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                              C. SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nMrs. HELEN JACKSON, New York.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe evasive and inconclusive character of these replies of the Secretary\r\nprovoked much comment, and gave rise to a very wide-spread and natural\r\nimpression that he was for some reason or other averse to the\r\nrestoration to the Poncas of their old homes. The letters were reviewed\r\nby one of the editors of the _New York Times_ in a paper so admirable\r\nthat the letters ought not to be printed without it.\r\n\r\nCIVIL RIGHTS IN ACRES.\r\n\r\n(From the _New York Times_, February 21st, 1880.)\r\n\r\n\"As most of the readers of the _Times_ already know, friends of the\r\nPonca Indians are endeavoring to have the tribe restored to their old\r\nreservation in Dakota. Or, more strictly speaking, it is proposed that\r\ntheir reservation shall be restored to them. The lands occupied by the\r\nPoncas were ceded to them by the United States by solemn treaty. By a\r\ncruel and wicked blunder, which no man has attempted to explain, those\r\nlands were ceded to the Sioux. But the Sioux did not want the lands, and\r\nthey have never occupied them unto this day. To this robbery of the\r\ntribe was added the destruction of their houses, movable property, and\r\nfarms. A citizen of the United States would have redress in the courts\r\nfor such an outrage as this. An Indian has no legal status. He is merely\r\na live and particularly troublesome animal, in the eye of the law. But,\r\nwhile the Poncas were trying to get back on their lands, they were\r\narrested by order of the Secretary of the Interior, on the charge of\r\nrunning away from the agency to which they had been sent by the\r\nGovernment when their lands were taken from them. It is not necessary to\r\nadd words to intensify this accumulation of criminal folly and wrong.\r\nCertain citizens of Nebraska, hearing of the injustice which was being\r\nperpetrated on the Poncas, raised funds, and had the chiefs brought\r\nbefore United States District Judge Dundy on a writ of _habeas corpus_,\r\nto inquire why they were thus restrained of their liberty. Judge Dundy\r\ndecided that an Indian was 'a person' within the meaning of the _Habeas\r\nCorpus_ Act, and that these persons were unlawfully held in duress.\r\n\r\n\"It was thought that the United States would appeal from this dictum,\r\nbut no appeal was taken, much to the disappointment of the friends of\r\nthe Indians, as it was hoped that a decision could be reached to show\r\nwhether the Indian was or was not so far clothed with the privilege of a\r\ncitizen that he could have a standing in the courts of law. Accordingly,\r\nthe public-spirited and philanthropic persons who had espoused the cause\r\nof the Poncas resolved to make up a case, which, carried to the United\r\nStates Supreme Court, should determine once and forever this moot point.\r\nTo this end money has been raised by subscription, by special gift, and\r\nby contributions taken at public meetings in various parts of the\r\ncountry. A lady residing in Boston, moved by the pitiful condition of\r\nthe Indians, who tried to struggle toward civilization, offered to\r\nsupply all the money which was lacking toward the expenses of the suit,\r\nprovided Secretary Schurz would give some public assurances that he\r\nfavored this manner of determining the case, or would give his reasons\r\nagainst this attempt. The lady's proposition was sent to Mrs. Helen Hunt\r\nJackson, whose disinterested and efficient labors in behalf of the\r\ndeeply-wronged Poncas had already attracted attention. Mrs. Jackson\r\nforwarded to Secretary Schurz the whole statement. Thereupon an\r\ninteresting correspondence ensued. This correspondence has been printed\r\nin the Boston papers, presumably by direction of Secretary Schurz.\r\n\r\n\"In reply to the request to say whether he approves of the movement to\r\ncarry the Ponca case to the Supreme Court, in order that the tribe may\r\nrecover their old reservation, the Secretary says that this would be\r\nuseless, as the courts have repeatedly decided that an Indian tribe\r\ncannot sue the United States. Unfortunately, Mr. Schurz does not cite\r\nthese cases, but we must take it for granted that he knows what he is\r\ntalking about. He adds that he has taken the advice of lawyers, who\r\ncoincide with him in this opinion. As a suit cannot be brought at all,\r\naccording to the Secretary and his legal advisers, it would be idle to\r\ncollect money for this purpose; and the Secretary suggests that, if the\r\ndisinterested friends of the Indians had consulted lawyers before they\r\nbegan their work, they would be of his opinion as to the futility of the\r\nattempt. This, of course, leaves the impression that the Secretary\r\nwithholds his approval of the movement to secure legal rights for the\r\nPoncas, though he does not say so in express terms. His reason for not\r\napproving the attempt is that it will do no good. His solution to the\r\nIndian problem, as it is vaguely called, is to settle the Indians in\r\nseveralty, breaking up their tribal organization, and giving to each\r\nindividual his lands in fee-simple. This, the Secretary thinks, will\r\nenable them to hold their lands by the same title as that by which white\r\nmen hold theirs, and, 'as a matter of course, they will have the same\r\nstanding in the courts' as white men. It is to be regretted that the\r\nSecretary did not pause here long enough to show how the giving to an\r\nIndian of 160 acres of land can clothe him with civil rights which he\r\ndoes not now possess, and which the Secretary thinks that the courts\r\ncannot give him. For this reason, however, Mr. Schurz is greatly in\r\nfavor of legislation providing for the settlement of the Indians in\r\nseveralty, various bills to accomplish which, he says, are in\r\npreparation. As for the money raised already, the Secretary suggests\r\nthat since, in his opinion, it would be misspent in obtaining judicial\r\ndecision, it might be used in the education of Indian children.\r\n\r\n\"Replying to this, Mrs. Jackson asks if the Secretary would be in favor\r\nof the Poncas recovering their lands by process of law, provided that\r\ncould be done. To this direct and very important inquiry we regret to\r\nnotice that the Secretary finds himself unable to reply, although, in a\r\nletter immediately following this, he does say that if an Indian tribe\r\ncould maintain an action at law in the courts to assert its rights, he\r\nwould no more object to it than he would to a white man's doing the same\r\nthing. As to the suggestion that the money collected for the expenses of\r\nlegal proceedings be used for educational purposes, Mrs. Jackson asks\r\nthe Secretary how it would be possible to take money given for one\r\nspecific purpose and use it for another and wholly different purpose.\r\nMr. Schurz rejoins that the consent of the donors may first be obtained;\r\nbut he forgets that it would be impossible to canvass the country to\r\nascertain the wishes of thousands of unknown givers to this fund.\r\nReferring to the intimation that the friends of the Indians had not\r\ntaken legal counsel in this matter, and that the Secretary had, Mrs.\r\nJackson observes that they did take such counsel, and that an omission\r\nto do so would have been indeed foolish.\r\n\r\n\"It will be observed that the Secretary's objection to the attempt to\r\nsecure civil rights is its futility; and, in answer to Mrs. Jackson's\r\nstatement that the friends of the Indians have sought the opinions of\r\nlawyers in this case, he replies that one 'can find lawyers of skill and\r\nstanding to undertake, for a good fee, any case, however hopeless.' To\r\nthose who might think that this is unjustly severe on the legal\r\nprofession, it should be said that Mr. Schurz has been by profession a\r\nlawyer, and should know what he is talking about. And we must presume\r\nthat Mr. Schurz's profound knowledge of the law, which is fortified by\r\nthe opinions of eminent legal men, induces him to consider the whole\r\ncase closed in advance of its submission to the courts. It would be\r\ninteresting, however, to know if the Secretary's lawyers of skill and\r\nstanding are less easily influenced by the prospect of a 'good fee' than\r\nthe lawyers of skill and standing consulted by the friends of the\r\nPoncas. The exceedingly able opinion of Secretary Schurz, we find, is\r\nthat it is useless to give the Indian a standing in the courts through\r\njudicial decisions, as he can readily secure this by accepting from the\r\nGovernment of the United States a deed of 160 acres of land.\"\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF THE PONCAS IN THE SUMMER OF 1880.\r\n\r\nStanding Bear and his party, after their release by the decision of\r\nJudge Dundy, settled on an island in the Niobrara River, which was a\r\npart of their old reservation, and had fortunately been overlooked when\r\nthe United States Government took forcible possession of the rest of\r\ntheir land and presented it to the Sioux. Here they were joined by other\r\nfugitives of their tribe till the number reached about one hundred and\r\nthirty. A committee which had been organized in Omaha for their relief\r\nsupplied them with farming implements, and they went industriously to\r\nwork. This committee published in July, 1880, a report containing the\r\nfollowing paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\"We consider the treatment of the Ponca Indians as one of the most\r\nheart-sickening chapters in our national record of Indian wrongs, and we\r\nare determined to spare no effort to restore to them their stolen homes\r\nand rights, and to relieve the American people of the stigma of this\r\nterrible wrong.\r\n\r\n\"The Senate of the United States during the past winter appointed a\r\nselect committee 'to ascertain and report the circumstances of the\r\nremoval of the Ponca Indians from their reservation, and whether the\r\nsaid Indians are not entitled to be restored thereto.' This Senate\r\nCommittee devoted a long time to a thorough and patient investigation of\r\nthis whole Ponca case, and reported that the Poncas had been 'forced,\r\nwithout authority of law, from their homes to the Indian Territory,' and\r\nreported also a bill for their restoration to their former reservation,\r\nand recommending 'that $50,000 be appropriated for the purpose of taking\r\nthe Poncas back, and restoring their now dilapidated homes.'\r\n\r\n\"This able report of the United States Senate says that 'in dealing with\r\none of the most peaceable and orderly and well-disposed of all the\r\ntribes of Indians, the Government has violated in the most flagrant\r\nmanner their rights of property, and disregarded their appeals to the\r\nhonor and justice of the United States, and the dictates of humanity.'\"\r\n\r\nThe report also says that \"the committee can find no language\r\nsufficiently strong to condemn the whole proceeding, and trace to it all\r\nthe troubles which have come upon the Poncas, and the hardships and\r\nsufferings which have followed them since they were taken from their old\r\nreservation and placed in their present position in the Indian\r\nTerritory.\"\r\n\r\nThe Omaha Ponca Relief Committee need no better vindication of their\r\naction in behalf of this distressed and outraged people than these\r\nstrong and weighty words of a committee of United States Senators,\r\ncomposed of representative men of both political parties.\r\n\r\nThe Omaha Committee consisted of Bishop Clarkson, of Nebraska, chairman;\r\nRev. A. F. Sherrill, Rev. W. I. Harsha, Leavitt Burnham, W. M. Yates,\r\nand P. L. Perine.\r\n\r\nAt the request of this committee, Mr. T. H. Tibbles in June went to the\r\nIndian Territory to visit the Poncas (of whom only about 400 were left\r\nalive). He was authorized \"to assure them of the interest and efforts of\r\nhumane people all over the country in their behalf, and to notify them\r\nthat the Omaha Committee were ready to assist them in any practical way\r\nto return to their old homes, from which they had been unjustly and\r\ninhumanly ejected.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Tibbles succeeded in visiting the Poncas, although the Government\r\nagent interfered with him in many ways, and finally arrested him by\r\nauthority of an order from Washington to arrest any member of the Omaha\r\nCommittee who came upon the reservation. He was insulted by the agent,\r\ntaken by force out of the reservation, and threatened with much more\r\nsevere treatment if he ever returned.\r\n\r\nThis high-handed outrage on a free citizen of the United States aroused\r\nindignation throughout the country. The comments of the Press on the\r\noccurrence showed that people were at last waking up to a sense of the\r\ntyrannical injustice of the Indian Department. The _New York Tribune_\r\nsaid, editorially:\r\n\r\n\"The Indian Department may as well understand at once that the Ponca\r\ncase has passed out of their control. It is a matter of simple justice\r\nwhich the people are determined to see righted. *** No petty Indian\r\nagent has the legal right to imprison, maltreat, and threaten the life\r\nof any citizen totally guiltless of offence beyond that of working to\r\ngive these serfs of the Government the standing of human beings. *** It\r\nis the Government of this great Republic, where all men are free and\r\nequal, that holds these Poncas prisoners on a tract where to remain is\r\ndeath. They are innocent of any crime except that they have been robbed\r\nof their land, and that they ask to bring suit, as a black man or\r\nconvict could do, in the courts for its recovery.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Tibbles reported the condition of the Poncas in Indian Territory as\r\n\"deplorable in the extreme. They live in constant dread and fear, and\r\nare as much imprisoned as if they were in a penitentiary.\" They seem \"to\r\nhave lost all hope, are broken-hearted and disconsolate. With one or two\r\nexceptions, they are making no effort to help themselves. Their\r\nso-called farms are miserable little patches, to which they pay very\r\nlittle attention. One of them said to me, 'If the Government forces me\r\nto stay here, it can feed me. I had a good farm back at our old home,\r\nand if I was back there I would farm again; I have no heart to work\r\nhere.' The one hundred and fifteen who are back on the old reservation\r\nhave a much larger amount of land under cultivation than the whole four\r\nhundred who are in Indian Territory. They have kept their crops in good\r\ncondition, and are full of energy and hope.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government Agency for the Poncas having been transferred to the\r\nIndian Territory, the annuities due the tribe were of course paid there,\r\nand that portion of the tribe which had fled back to Dakota received\r\nnothing. Moreover, the Indian Bureau issued an order forbidding any\r\nPonca who should leave the Indian Territory to take with him any kind of\r\nproperty whatsoever, under penalty of being arrested for stealing. As\r\nthey could not take their families on the long, hard journey to Dakota\r\nwithout food or means of transportation, this order kept them imprisoned\r\nin Indian Territory as effectually as a military guard could have done.\r\n\r\nThe Government employés in charge of them reported, meanwhile, that they\r\nhad \"made up their minds to live and die where they are. *** There\r\nexists a feeling of contentment in the tribe that will make it very\r\ndifficult for any one to induce them to leave their present home,\" says\r\na general press despatch, presumably dictated by the Indian Bureau, and\r\nsent throughout the country on July 15th.\r\n\r\nIt seems an insult to people's common-sense to suppose that this\r\nstatement would be believed, close on the heels of the general order for\r\nthe arrest of all fleeing Poncas who should dare to take with them out\r\nof the Indian Territory one dollar's worth of property. A very\r\nsuperfluous piece of legislation, surely, for a community so \"contented\"\r\nthat it would be \"difficult for any one to induce them to leave their\r\nhomes.\"\r\n\r\nTHE LEGAL ASPECT OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\nThe chivalric and disinterested attorneys who had had the charge of the\r\nPonca case from the outset, were not to be intimidated by the threats\r\nnor outwitted by the expedients of the Indian Bureau. The ingenious\r\ndevices practised by the Department of the Interior to hinder the\r\ngetting service of summons upon the defendants in the suits necessary to\r\nrecover the Poncas' lands, make by themselves a shameful chapter, which\r\nwill some day be written out. But on the 13th of July the attorneys were\r\nable to report to the Omaha Committee as follows:\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE ATTORNEYS.\r\n\r\n                                                 Omaha, July 13th, 1880.\r\n\r\n                   _To Omaha Ponca Indian Committee_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the inquiry of one of your members as to the condition of\r\nthe suits instituted by us to liberate Standing Bear and his associate\r\nfrom the custody of the military, and to recover possession of the Ponca\r\nreservation, we make the following statement:\r\n\r\nOn April 8th, 1879, was filed by us the petition in the case of United\r\nStates _ex rel._ Ma-chu-nah-zha (Standing Bear) _et al._ _vs._ George\r\nCrook, a Brigadier-general of the Army of the United States and\r\nCommander of the Department of the Platte, in the U.S. District Court\r\nfor the District of Nebraska, for a writ of _habeas corpus_ for the\r\nrelease of Standing Bear and his companions. This cause was tried about\r\nthe first of May, 1879, and Standing Bear and his companions were\r\nrestored to their liberty. Thereupon the U. S. District-attorney took\r\nthe case to the United States Circuit Court for this District by appeal,\r\nand about May 19th, upon hearing before Mr. Justice Miller, Associate\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court of the United States, was there continued,\r\nand on January 5th, 1880, the appeal was dismissed on the motion of the\r\nU. S. District-attorney.\r\n\r\nOn April 3d, 1880, was commenced by us the case of Ponca tribe of\r\nIndians _vs._ Makh-pi-ah-lu-ta, or Red Cloud, in his own behalf, and in\r\nbehalf of the Sioux nation of Indians, in the U. S. Circuit Court for\r\nthe District of Nebraska, and on May 18th, 1880, we commenced in the\r\nsame court the case of Ponca tribe of Indians _vs._ Sioux nation of\r\nIndians. These cases were commenced, and are being prosecuted by us, to\r\nrecover possession of and establish the title of the Ponca tribe of\r\nIndians to so much of their old reservation as lies within the limits of\r\nNebraska. Great delay was made necessary in the commencement of these\r\ncases, and the ones subsequently commenced in Dakota, of which we below\r\nmake mention, owing to difficulties in getting service of summons upon\r\nthe defendants. On May 22d, 1880, service of summons was had on the\r\ndefendants in both cases, and some action will be taken therein at the\r\nnext term of the court.\r\n\r\nAbout the 20th of May, 1880, there were commenced in Dakota other suits\r\nin the name of the Ponca tribe of Indians, and against the Sioux nation\r\nof Indians, and against certain of their chiefs, to settle and establish\r\nthe title of the Ponca tribe of Indians to so much of their old\r\nreservation as lies within the limits of Dakota. Service has been had in\r\nthese cases, and the several suits mentioned will be prosecuted by us\r\nwith all convenient speed.\r\n\r\nWe might add that we also have in charge the case of John Elk _vs._\r\nCharles Wilkins, in the U. S. Circuit Court for this District, which is\r\nbeing prosecuted by us to determine the rights of Indians under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n                        Respectfully submitted,\r\n\r\n                                                        A.

He observed that, irrespective of the principles of\r\nreligion and justice, it was the interest and should be the policy of\r\nthe United States to be at peace with them; but that could not\r\ncontinue to be the case if the treaties existing between them and the\r\nGovernment were broken with impunity by the inhabitants of the\r\nTerritory. He referred to the well-known fact that while the white men\r\nloudly complained of every injury committed by the Indians, however\r\ntrifling, and demanded immediate reparation, they were daily\r\nperpetrating against them injuries and wrongs of the most provoking\r\nand atrocious nature, for which the perpetrators had not been brought\r\nto justice. *** He stated that the number of those unfortunate people\r\nwho had been murdered since the peace of Greenville was sufficient to\r\nproduce serious alarm for the consequences. He added, further, that a\r\nlate attempt to bring to punishment a white man, who was clearly\r\nproved to have killed two adult Indians and wounded two of their\r\nchildren, had proved abortive.\"—BURNET'S _Notes on North-west\r\nTerritory_.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF NORTH-WESTERN INDIANS.\r\n\r\n\"Among other falsehoods it has been asserted confidently, but without a\r\nshadow of argument or fact to sustain the assertion, that they cannot be\r\nbrought to a state of civilization, or be induced to form communities\r\nand engage in the pursuits of agriculture and the arts, in consequence\r\nof some physical difference between them and the Anglo-Saxon race. This\r\nhypothesis is contradicted by experience, which has abundantly shown\r\nthat the two races, when placed in the same situation, and acted upon by\r\nthe same causes, have invariably resorted to the same expedients and\r\npursued the same policy.\r\n\r\n\"This averment is sustained by a reference to the white people who have\r\nbeen taken prisoners in childhood and brought up among the Indians. In\r\nevery such case the child of civilization has become the ferocious adult\r\nof the forest, manifesting all the peculiarities, tastes, and\r\npreferences of the native Indian. His manners, habits, propensities, and\r\npursuits have been the same, so that the most astute philosophical\r\nobserver has not been able to discover any difference between them,\r\nexcept in the color of the skin, and in some instances even this has\r\nbeen removed by long exposure to the elements, and the free use of oils\r\nand paints.\"\r\n\r\nThe many instances which there are on record of cases in which persons\r\ntaken captive by the Indians, while young, have utterly refused in later\r\nlife to return to their relatives and homes, go to confirm this\r\nstatement of Judge Burnet's.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he says: \"The attempts that have been made at\r\ndifferent times to improve the minds and cultivate the morals of these\r\npeople have always been attended by success.\r\n\r\n\"On an unprejudiced comparison between the civilized educated white man\r\nand the civilized educated Indian, all this theory of an organic\r\nconstitutional difference between the European and the native Indian\r\nvanishes.\r\n\r\n\"In what respect have Ross, Boudinot, Hicks, Ridge, and others differed\r\nfrom the educated men of our own race? Inasmuch then as the reclaimed\r\neducated Indian becomes assimilated to the white man, and the European\r\nbrought up from infancy among the Indians becomes identified with them,\r\nthis alleged difference cannot be real, it must be imaginary.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, the difficulty of civilizing the natives of this continent\r\nis neither greater nor less than that which retarded the improvement of\r\nthe barbarous nations of Europe two thousand years ago. *** Men\r\nuncivilized have always delighted in the chase, and had a propensity to\r\nroam; both history and experience prove that nothing but necessity,\r\narising from such an increase of population as destroys the game, has\r\never induced men to settle in communities, and rely on the cultivation\r\nof the earth for subsistence. In the progress of civilization the chase\r\nhas given way to the pastoral state, and that has yielded to agriculture\r\nas the increase of numbers has rendered it necessary.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the Cherokees and the Wyandots were surrounded by a white\r\npopulation, and their territory was so contracted as to cut off their\r\ndependence on hunting and fishing, they became farmers, and manifested a\r\nstrong desire to cultivate the arts; and this would have been the choice\r\nof the whole Indian race if the policy of the Government had permitted\r\nit!\r\n\r\n\"It is not just to consider the natives of this country as a distinct\r\nand inferior race because they do not generally imitate us, when we not\r\nonly remove every consideration that could induce them to do so, but in\r\nfact render it impossible. What motive of ambition was there to\r\nstimulate them to effort, when they were made to feel that they held\r\ntheir country as tenants at will, liable to be driven off at the\r\npleasure of their oppressors?\r\n\r\n\"As soon as they were brought to a situation in which necessity prompted\r\nthem to industry, and induced them to begin to adopt our manners and\r\nhabits of life, the covetous eye of the white man was fixed on their\r\nincipient improvements, and they received the chilling notice that they\r\nmust look elsewhere for permanent homes.\r\n\r\n\"At the time our settlements were commencing north-west of the Ohio, the\r\nIndians were its acknowledged owners and sovereigns; the Government\r\nclaimed no right either of occupancy or soil, except as they obtained it\r\nby purchase.\"\r\n\r\n(On the 31st of July, 1793, the United States Commissioners said to the\r\nassembled chiefs of the North-western tribes, in a council held at the\r\nhome of one Captain Elliott, on the Detroit River: \"By the express\r\nauthority of the President of the United States, we acknowledge the\r\nproperty, or right of soil to the great country above described, to be\r\nin the Indian nations as long as they desire to occupy it; we claim only\r\nthe tracts before particularly mentioned, and the right of pre-emption\r\ngranted by the King, as before explained.\")\r\n\r\n\"The entire country from Pennsylvania to the Mississippi was admitted to\r\nbe theirs, and a more delightful, fertile valley cannot be found on the\r\nearth. ***\r\n\r\n\"Unconscious of the ruinous consequences that were to follow their\r\nintimacy with white men, they ceded to the American Government large and\r\nvaluable portions of the country at nominal prices. Those lands were\r\nrapidly settled by Americans, in whose purity and friendship the\r\nunsuspecting natives had great confidence; nor did they awake from that\r\ndelusion till their habits of sobriety and morality had been undermined,\r\nand the vices engendered by intemperance and idleness had contaminated\r\nevery tribe. ***\r\n\r\n\"Their subsistence became precarious; their health declined; their\r\nself-respect, their dignity of character, and the heroism inherited from\r\ntheir ancestors were lost. They became in their own estimation a\r\ndegraded, dependent race. The Government, availing itself of their\r\nweakness and want of energy, succeeded by bribes and menaces in\r\nobtaining the best portions of their country, and eventually in driving\r\nthem from the land of their birth to a distant home in an unknown\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\"This distressing chapter of aboriginal history began at the treaty of\r\nGreenville, in 1795, and terminated in less than fifty years.

IRVING.\r\n\r\n\"I fearlessly assert to the world, and I defy contradiction, that the\r\nNorth American Indian is everywhere in his native state a highly moral\r\nand religious being, endowed by his Maker with an intuitive knowledge of\r\nsome great Author of his being and the universe—in dread of whose\r\ndispleasure he constantly lives with the apprehension before him of a\r\nfuture state, when he expects to be rewarded or punished according to\r\nthe merits he has gained or forfeited in this world.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw any other people who spend so much of their lives in\r\nhumbling themselves before and worshipping the Great Spirit as these\r\ntribes do, nor any whom I would not as soon suspect of insincerity and\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\n\"Self-denial and self-torture, and almost self-immolation, are continual\r\nmodes of appealing to the Great Spirit for his countenance and\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\n\"To each other I have found these people kind and honorable, and endowed\r\nwith every feeling of parental, filial, and conjugal affection that is\r\nmet with in more enlightened communities.\"—CATLIN'S _North American\r\nIndians_.\r\n\r\nMr. Catlin spent eight years among the Indians more than forty years\r\nago. He travelled among the wildest of them, lived with them in the\r\nfreest intimacy, and this is his verdict as to their native traits, when\r\nuncontaminated by white men and whiskey.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1724, the Jesuit Father Lafitau wrote of the Indians, and\r\nstated that to his own experience he added that of Father Garnier, who\r\nhad lived sixty years among them: \"They are possessed,\" says he, \"of\r\nsound judgment, lively imagination, ready conception, and wonderful\r\nmemory. All the tribes retain at least some trace of an ancient\r\nreligion, handed down to them from their ancestors, and a form of\r\ngovernment. They reflect justly upon their affairs, and better than the\r\nmass of the people among ourselves. They prosecute their ends by sure\r\nmeans; they evince a degree of coolness and composure which would exceed\r\nour patience; they never permit themselves to indulge in passion, but\r\nalways, from a sense of honor and greatness of soul, appear masters of\r\nthemselves. They are high-minded and proud; possess a courage equal to\r\nevery trial, an intrepid valor, the most heroic constancy under\r\ntorments, and an equanimity which neither misfortunes nor reverses can\r\nshake. Toward each other they behave with a natural politeness and\r\nattention, entertaining a high respect for the aged, and a consideration\r\nfor their equals which appears scarcely reconcilable with that freedom\r\nand independence of which they are so jealous. They make few professions\r\nof kindness, but yet are affable and generous. Toward strangers and the\r\nunfortunate they exercise a degree of hospitality and charity which\r\nmight put the inhabitants of Europe to the blush.\"\r\n\r\nFather Lafitau does not disguise the fact that the Indians have great\r\nfaults. He says they are \"suspicious and vindictive, cruel to their\r\nenemies.\"\r\n\r\nPère Lallemant, a missionary among the Hurons, says: \"In point of\r\nintellect they are not at all inferior to the natives of Europe; I could\r\nnot have believed that, without instruction, nature could have produced\r\nsuch ready and vigorous eloquence, or such a sound judgment in their\r\naffairs as that which I have so much admired among the Hurons. I admit\r\nthat their habits and customs are barbarous in a thousand ways; but,\r\nafter all, in matters which they consider as wrong, and which their\r\npublic condemns, we observe among them less criminality than in France,\r\nalthough here the only punishment of a crime is the shame of having\r\ncommitted it.\"\r\n\r\nIn a history of New France, published in 1618, it is stated of the\r\nIndians that \"they are valorous, faithful, generous, and humane; their\r\nhospitality is so great that they extend it to every one who is not\r\ntheir enemy. They speak with much judgment and reason, and, when they\r\nhave any important enterprise to undertake, the chief is attentively\r\nlistened to for two or three hours together, and he is answered point to\r\npoint, as the subject may require.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1656 the Jesuit missionaries among the Iroquois reported: \"Among many\r\nfaults caused by their blindness and barbarous education, we meet with\r\nvirtues enough to cause shame among the most of Christians. Hospitals\r\nfor the poor would be useless among them, because there are no beggars;\r\nthose who have are so liberal to those who are in want, that everything\r\nis enjoyed in common. The whole village must be in distress before any\r\nindividual is left in necessity.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Carver, who travelled in 1766 among the wildest tribes,\r\ndescribes them as \"cruel, barbarous, and revengeful in war, persevering\r\nand inflexible in pursuit of an enemy, sanguinary in their treatment of\r\nprisoners, and sparing neither age nor sex.\" On the other hand, he found\r\nthem temperate in their mode of living, patient of hunger and fatigue,\r\nsociable and humane to all whom they looked on as friends, and ready to\r\nshare with them the last morsel of food they possessed, or to expose\r\ntheir lives in their defence. In their public character he describes\r\nthem as \"possessing an attachment to their nation unknown to the\r\ninhabitants of any other country, combining as if actuated by one soul\r\nagainst a common enemy, never swayed in their councils by selfish or\r\nparty views, but sacrificing everything to the honor and advantage of\r\ntheir tribe, in support of which they fear no danger, and are affected\r\nby no sufferings. They are not only affectionately attached, indeed, to\r\ntheir own offspring, but are extremely fond of children in general. They\r\ninstruct them carefully in their own principles, and train them up with\r\nattention in the maxims and habits of their nation. Their system\r\nconsists chiefly in the influence of example, and impressing on them the\r\ntraditionary histories of their ancestors. When the children act wrong,\r\ntheir parents remonstrate and reprimand but never chastise\r\nthem.\"—_HALKETT'S Hist. Notes._\r\n\r\nThe very idea of corporal punishment of little children seems to have\r\nbeen peculiarly obnoxious to the native North American. In the \"Relation\r\nde Nouvelle France,\" published in 1633, there is a curious story of an\r\nincident which took place at Quebec. A party of Indians, watching a\r\nFrench drummer-boy beat his drum, pressed more closely around him than\r\nhe liked, and he struck one of the Indians in the face with his\r\ndrum-stick so sharply that the blow drew blood. The Indians, much\r\noffended, went to the interpreter and demanded apologies and a present,\r\naccording to their custom. \"No,\" said the interpreter, \"our custom is to\r\npunish the offender; we will punish the boy in your presence.\" When the\r\nIndians saw the child stripped for the flogging they began immediately\r\nto beg for his pardon; but as the soldiers continued their preparations\r\nfor whipping the lad, one of the Indians suddenly stripped himself and\r\nthrew his robe over the boy, crying out, \"Scourge me, if you choose, but\r\ndo not strike the boy!\" The good Father Le Jeune, who tells this story,\r\nadds that this unwillingness of the Indians to see any child chastised\r\n\"will probably occasion trouble to us in the design we have to instruct\r\ntheir youth.\"\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1587 we find evidence that the Indians were not without\r\nreligion. Thomas Hariot, an employé of Sir Walter Raleigh's, writing\r\nfrom the Virginia colony, says of the Virginia Indians: \"Theye beleeve\r\nthat there are many gods, which theye call Mantaoc, but of different\r\nsorts and degrees; one onely chief and Great God, which hath been from\r\nall eternitie; who, as theye affirme, when hee proposed to make the\r\nworld, made first other gods of a principall order, to bee as means and\r\ninstruments to bee used in the creation and government to folow; and\r\nafter the sunne, moone, and starres as pettie gods, and the instruments\r\nof the other order more principall.\"\r\n\r\n\"In general,\" says Hunter, \"a day seldom passes with an elderly Indian,\r\nor others who are esteemed wise and good, in which a blessing is not\r\nasked, or thanks returned to the Giver of Life, sometimes audibly, but\r\nmore generally in the devotional language of the heart.\"\r\n\r\nAll the employés of the North-west Fur Company bear the same testimony\r\nto the fidelity and honesty of the Indians.\r\n\r\nGeneral H. Sibley once said to Bishop Whipple that for thirty years it\r\nhad been the uniform boast of the Sioux in every council that they had\r\nnever taken the life of a white man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n                OUTRAGES COMMITTED ON INDIANS BY WHITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Captain Bonneville's narrative of five years spent in the Rocky\r\nMountains are many instances of cruel outrages committed by whites upon\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n\"One morning one of his trappers, discovering that his traps had been\r\ncarried off in the night, took a horrid oath that he would kill the\r\nfirst Indian he should meet, innocent or guilty. As he was returning\r\nwith his comrades to camp, he beheld two unfortunate Root Diggers seated\r\non the bank, fishing; advancing upon them, he levelled his rifle, shot\r\none on the spot, and flung his bleeding body into the stream.\r\n\r\n\"A short time afterward, when this party of trappers were about to cross\r\nOgden's River, a great number of Shoshokies, or Root Diggers, were\r\nposted on the opposite bank, when they imagined they were there with\r\nhostile intent; they advanced upon them, levelled their rifles, and\r\nkilled twenty-five of them on the spot. The rest fled to a short\r\ndistance, then halted and turned about, howling and whining like wolves,\r\nand uttering most piteous wailings. The trappers chased them in every\r\ndirection. The poor wretches made no defence, but fled in terror; nor\r\ndoes it appear from the accounts of the boasted victors that a weapon\r\nhad been wielded by the Indians throughout the affair.\"\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be an emulation among these trappers which could inflict\r\nthe greatest outrages on the natives. They chased them at full speed,\r\nlassoed them like cattle, and dragged them till they were dead.\r\n\r\nAt one time, when some horses had been stolen by the Riccarees, this\r\nsame party of trappers took two Riccaree Indians prisoners, and declared\r\nthat, unless the tribe restored every horse that had been stolen, these\r\ntwo Indians, who had strayed into the trappers' camp without any\r\nknowledge of the offence committed, should be burnt to death.\r\n\r\n\"To give force to their threat, a pyre of logs and fagots was heaped up\r\nand kindled into a blaze. The Riccarees released one horse and then\r\nanother; but, finding that nothing but the relinquishment of all their\r\nspoils would purchase the lives of the captives, they abandoned them to\r\ntheir fate, moving off with many parting words and howlings, when the\r\nprisoners were dragged to the blazing pyre and burnt to death in sight\r\nof their retreating comrades.\r\n\r\n\"Such are the acts that lead to terrible recriminations on the part of\r\nthe Indians. Individual cases of the kind dwell in the recollections of\r\nwhole tribes, and it is a point of honor and conscience to avenge them.\r\n\r\n\"The records of the wars between the early settlers of Virginia and New\r\nEngland and the natives exhibit cruelties on both sides that make one\r\nshudder. *** When the Indian would tear the scalp from the crown of the\r\nscarcely yet dead victim, and mutilate the body, could he be expected to\r\nreform those cruelties when he saw the white man in his turn cut off the\r\nheads of his people, and mutilate and quarter their bodies, as was done\r\nwith King Philip's, whose head, after being cut off, was sent to\r\nPlymouth and hung up there on a gibbet, where it remained twenty years,\r\nwhile one of his hands was sent to Boston as a trophy, his body being\r\nquartered and hung upon four trees?\"—_M'FORLEY'S History and Travels._\r\n\r\nFROM REPORT OF THE INDIAN BUREAU FOR 1854.\r\n\r\n                     \"Port Orford, Oregon Territory, February 5th, 1854.\r\n\r\n\"I grieve to report to you that a most horrid massacre, or rather an\r\nout-and-out barbarous murder, was perpetrated on a portion of the Nason\r\ntribe, residing at the mouth of the Coquille River, on the morning of\r\nthe 28th of January last, by a party of forty miners. Before giving you\r\nthe result of my examination and my own conclusions, I will give you the\r\nreasons which that party assign in justification of their acts.\r\n\r\n\"They avow that, for some time past, the Indians at the mouth of the\r\nCoquille have been insolent; that they have been in the habit of riding\r\nthe horses of white men without permission; that of late they have\r\ncommitted many thefts, such as stealing paddles and many other articles\r\nthe property of white men; that one of their number recently discharged\r\nhis gun at the ferry-house; and that but a few days prior to the attack\r\non the Indians, the chief, on leaving the ferry-house, where he had just\r\nbeen fed, fired his gun at a party of four white men standing near the\r\ndoor of the house. They further state that, on the 27th of January, they\r\nsent for the chief to come in for a talk; that he not only refused to\r\ncome in, but sent back word that he would kill white men if they came to\r\nhis home; that he meant to kill all the white men he could; that he was\r\ndetermined to drive the white men out of his country; that he would kill\r\nthe men at the ferry, and burn their houses. Immediately after this\r\nconversation with the chief, the white men at and near the ferry-house\r\nassembled, and deliberated on the necessity of an immediate attack on\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\n\"The result of their deliberation, with the full proceedings of their\r\nmeeting, is herein enclosed. At the conclusion, a courier was despatched\r\nto the upper mines for assistance. A party of about twenty responded to\r\nthe call, and arrived at the ferry-house on the evening preceding the\r\nmorning of the massacre. On the arrival of this re-enforcement the\r\nproceedings of the meeting first held were reconsidered, and unanimously\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n\"At the dawn of day on the morning of the 28th of January the party of\r\nthe ferry, joined by about twenty men from the upper mines, organized,\r\nand, in three detachments, marched upon the Indian ranches, and\r\nconsummated a most inhuman slaughter. A full account of what they term\r\n'a fight' you will find in the report which their captain, George H.\r\nAbbott, forwarded to me on the day of the massacre.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians were roused from sleep to meet their death, with but feeble\r\nshow of resistance. They were shot down as they were attempting to\r\nescape from their houses; fifteen men and one squaw killed; two squaws\r\nbadly wounded. On the part of the white men, not even the slightest\r\nwound was received. The houses of the Indians, with but one exception,\r\nwere fired, and entirely destroyed. Thus was committed a massacre too\r\ninhuman to be readily believed. Now for my examination of this horrid\r\naffair.\r\n\r\n\"On the morning of the 29th of January I left Port Orford for the\r\nCoquille. We arrived at the ferry-house early in the evening of that\r\nday. Early in the morning of the day after my arrival I sent for the\r\nchief, who immediately came in, attended by about thirty of his people.\r\nThe chief, as well as his people, was so greatly alarmed—apparently\r\napprehensive that the white men would kill them even in my presence—that\r\nit was with a good deal of difficulty that I could induce him to express\r\nhis mind freely. He seemed only anxious to stipulate for peace and the\r\nfuture safety of his people; and to procure this he was willing to\r\naccept any terms that I might dictate. The chief was evidently afraid to\r\ncomplain of or censure the slaughterers of his tribe, and for a time\r\nreplied to all the charges made against him with hesitancy. After\r\nrepeated assurances of protection, he finally answered to the point\r\nevery interrogatory. I asked him if he had at any time fired at the man\r\nat the ferry-house. 'No!' was his prompt reply. At the time he was said\r\nto have fired at the white man, he declared with great earnestness that\r\nhe shot at a duck in the river, at a distance of some two hundred yards\r\nfrom the ferry-house, when on his way home, and possibly the ball of his\r\ngun might have bounded from the water. My subsequent observation of the\r\ncourse of the river, and the point from which he was said to have fired,\r\nconvinced me that his statement was entitled to the fullest credit. His\r\nstatement is confirmed by the doubt expressed by one of the party at\r\nwhom he was said to have fired.\r\n\r\n\"The white men making the accusation only heard the whizzing of a\r\nbullet. This was the only evidence adduced in proof of the chief having\r\nfired at them. I asked the chief if he, or if to his knowledge any of\r\nhis people, had ever fired at the ferry-house. To this he answered,\r\n'No.' He most emphatically denied ever sending threatening language to\r\nthe men at the ferry, but admitted that some of his people had. He also\r\nadmitted that some of his tribe had stolen from white men, and that they\r\nhad used their horses without permission. He did not deny that his heart\r\nhad been bad toward white men, and that he had hoped they would leave\r\nhis country. He promised to do all I required of him. If I desired, he\r\nsaid he would leave the home of his fathers and take his people to the\r\nmountains; but, with my permission and protection, he would prefer\r\nremaining in the present home of his people.\r\n\r\n\"Everything I asked or required of him he readily assented to, promising\r\nmost solemnly to maintain on his part permanent friendly relations with\r\nwhite men. My interview with the tribe occupied about two hours. During\r\nthe entire council they listened with most profound attention, evidently\r\nbeing determined to fasten on their minds all that fell from my lips. At\r\nthe conclusion of the council I requested the chief to send for all the\r\nguns and pistols in the possession of his men. You will be surprised\r\nwhen I tell you that all the guns and pistols in the hands of the\r\nIndians at the ranches amounted to just five pieces, two of which were\r\nunserviceable; as to powder and ball, I do not believe they had five\r\nrounds. Does this look like being prepared for war? Can any sane man\r\nbelieve those Indians, numbering not over seventy-five, all told,\r\nincluding women and children, had concocted a plan to expel from their\r\ncountry some three hundred whites? Such a conclusion is too preposterous\r\nto be entertained for a moment. There was no necessity for resorting to\r\nsuch extreme measures. I regard the murder of those Indians as one of\r\nthe most barbarous acts ever perpetrated by civilized men. But what can\r\nbe done? The leaders of the party cannot be arrested, though justice\r\nloudly demands their punishment. Here we have not even a justice of the\r\npeace; and as to the military force garrisoned at Fort Orford, it\r\nconsists of four men. If such murderous assaults are to be continued,\r\nthere will be no end of Indian war in Oregon.\"—_F. M. SMITH, Sub-Agent._\r\n\r\nThe Simon Kenton referred to in the following narrative was an\r\nexperienced Indian fighter, and commanded a regiment in the war of 1812.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of the war of 1812 a plan was formed by some of the\r\nmilitia stationed at Urbana, Ohio, to attack an encampment of friendly\r\nIndians, who had been threatened by the hostile tribes, and were invited\r\nto remove with their families within our frontier settlements as a place\r\nof safety, under an assurance that they should be protected. Kenton\r\nremonstrated against the movement as being not only mutinous, but\r\ntreacherous and cowardly. He vindicated the Indian character against the\r\nfalse charges which were alleged in justification of the outrage they\r\nwere about to perpetrate, and warned them against the infamy they would\r\nincur by destroying a defenceless band of men, women, and children, who\r\nhad been induced to place themselves in their power by a solemn promise\r\nof protection.\r\n\r\n\"He appealed to their humanity, their honor, and their duty as soldiers.\r\nHe contrasted his knowledge of the character of those unfortunate people\r\nwith their ignorance of it. He told them that he had endured suffering\r\nand torture at their hands again and again, but that it was in time of\r\nwar, when they were defending their wives and children, and when he was\r\nseeking to destroy and exterminate them; and that, under those\r\ncircumstances, he had no right to complain, and never did complain. But,\r\nsaid he, in time of peace they have always been kind, faithful friends,\r\nand generous, trustworthy men.\r\n\r\n\"Having exhausted the means of persuasion without effect, and finding\r\nthem still resolved on executing their purpose, he took a rifle and\r\ncalled on them to proceed at once to the execution of the foul\r\ndeed—declaring with great firmness that he would accompany them to the\r\nencampment, and shoot down the first man who attempted to molest it. 'My\r\nlife,' said he, 'is drawing to a close: what remains of it is not worth\r\nmuch;' but, much or little, he was resolved that, if they entered the\r\nIndian camp, it should be done by passing over his corpse. Knowing that\r\nthe old veteran would fulfil his promise, their hearts failed them; not\r\none ventured to take the lead; their purpose was abandoned, and the\r\nIndians were saved.\"—_BURNET on the North-west Territory._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n\r\n                                EXTRACTS\r\n\r\n          FROM THE REPORT OF THE COMMISSION SENT TO TREAT WITH\r\n               THE SIOUX CHIEF, SITTING BULL, IN CANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commission consisted of Brigadier-general Terry, Hon. A. G.\r\nLawrence, and Colonel Corbin, secretary. After one month's journey,\r\n_via_ Omaha, Nebraska, Helena, Montana, and Fort Benton, these gentlemen\r\nwere met on the Canadian boundary by a Canadian officer with a mounted\r\nescort, who conducted them to Fort Walsh, when they were met by Sitting\r\nBull and the other chiefs.\r\n\r\nGeneral Terry recapitulated to them the advantages of being at peace\r\nwith the United States, the kindly treatment that all surrendered\r\nprisoners had received, and said: \"The President invites you to come to\r\nthe boundary of his and your country, and there give up your arms and\r\nammunition, and thence to go to the agencies to which he will assign\r\nyou, and there give up your horses, excepting those which are required\r\nfor peace purposes. Your arms and horses will then be sold, and with all\r\nthe money obtained for them cows will be bought and sent to you.\"\r\n\r\nIt is mortifying to think that representatives of the United States\r\nshould have been compelled gravely to submit in a formal council\r\nproposals so ludicrous as these. The Indians must have been totally\r\nwithout sense of humor if they could have listened to them without\r\nlaughter. Sitting Bull's reply is worthy of being put on record among\r\nthe notable protests of Indian chiefs against the oppressions of their\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"For sixty-four years you have kept me and my people, and\r\ntreated us bad. What have we done that you should want us to stop? We\r\nhave done nothing. It is all the people on your side that have started\r\nus to do all these depredations. We could not go anywhere else, and so\r\nwe took refuge in this country. *** I would like to know why you came\r\nhere. In the first place I did not give you the country; but you\r\nfollowed me from one place to another, so I had to leave and come over\r\nto this country. *** You have got ears, and you have got eyes to see\r\nwith them, and you see how I live with these people. You see me. Here I\r\nam. If you think I am a fool, you are a bigger fool than I am. This\r\nhouse is a medicine house. You come here to tell us lies, but we don't\r\nwant to hear them. I don't wish any such language used to me—that is, to\r\ntell me lies in my Great Mother's house. This country is mine, and I\r\nintend to stay here and to raise this country full of grown people. See\r\nthese people here. We were raised with them\" (again shaking hands with\r\nthe British officers). \"That is enough, so no more. *** The part of the\r\ncountry you gave me you ran me out of. *** I wish you to go back, and to\r\ntake it easy going back.\"\r\n\r\nThe-one-that-runs-the-Ree, a Santee chief, said: \"You didn't treat us\r\nwell, and I don't like you at all. *** I will be at peace with these\r\npeople as long as I live. This country is ours. We did not give it to\r\nyou. You stole it away from us. You have come over here to tell us lies,\r\nand I don't propose to talk much, and that is all I have to say. I want\r\nyou to take it easy going home. Don't go in a rush.\"\r\n\r\nNine, a Yankton, said: \"Sixty-four years ago you got our country, and\r\nyou promised to take good care of us and keep us. You ran from one place\r\nto another killing us and fighting us. *** You did not treat us right\r\nover there, so we came back over here. *** I come in to these people\r\nhere, _and they give me permission to trade with the traders_. _That is\r\nthe way I make my living._ Everything I get I buy from the traders. I\r\ndon't steal anything. *** I am going to live with these people here.\"\r\n\r\nSo profound a contempt did the Indians feel for this commission that\r\nthey allowed a squaw to address it.\r\n\r\nA squaw, named The-one-that-speaks-once, wife of\r\nThe-man-that-scatters-the-bear, said: \"I was over at your country. I\r\nwanted to raise my children there, but you did not give me any time. I\r\ncame over to this country to raise my children, and have a little peace\"\r\n(shaking hands with the British officers); \"that is all I have to say to\r\nyou. I want you to go back where you came from. These are the people\r\nthat I am going to stay with and raise my children with.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians having risen, being apparently about to leave the room, the\r\ninterpreter was directed to ask the following questions: \"Shall I say to\r\nthe President that you refuse the offers that he has made to you? Are we\r\nto understand that you refuse those offers?\" Sitting Bull answered: \"I\r\ncould tell you more, but that is all I have to tell. If we told you\r\nmore, you would not pay any attention to it. This part of the country\r\ndoes not belong to your people. You belong on the other side, this side\r\nbelongs to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Crow, shaking hands, and embracing Colonel McLeod, and shaking hands\r\nwith the other British officers, said: \"This is the way I will live in\r\nthis part of the country. *** _These people that don't hide anything_,\r\nthey are all the people I like. *** Sixty-four years ago I shook hands\r\nwith the soldiers, and ever since that I have had hardships. I made\r\npeace with them; and ever since then I have been running from one place\r\nto another to keep out of their way. *** Go to where you were born, and\r\nstay there. I came over to this country, and my Great Mother knows all\r\nabout it. She knows I came over here, and she don't wish anything of me.\r\nWe think, and all the women in the camp think, we are going to have the\r\ncountry full of people. *** I have come back in this part of the country\r\nagain to have plenty more people, to live in peace, and raise children.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians then inquired whether the commission had anything more to\r\nsay, and the commission answered that they had nothing more to say, and\r\nthe conference closed.\r\n\r\nThe commission, with a naïve lack of comprehension of the true situation\r\nof the case, go on to say that \"they are convinced that Sitting Bull and\r\nthe bands under him will not seek to return to this country at present.\r\nIt is believed that they are restrained from returning,\" partly by their\r\nrecollection of the severe handling they had by the military forces of\r\nthe United States in the last winter and spring, and partly \"by their\r\nbelief that, for some reason which they cannot fathom, the Government of\r\nthe United States earnestly desires that they shall return. *** In their\r\nintense hostility to our Government, they are determined to contravene\r\nits wishes to the best of their ability.\" It would seem so—even to the\r\nextent of foregoing all the privileges offered them on their return—the\r\ngiving up of all weapons—the exchanging of their horses for cows—and the\r\npriceless privilege of being shut up on reservations, off which they\r\ncould not go without being pursued, arrested, and brought back by\r\ntroops. What a depth of malignity must be in the breasts of these\r\nIndians, that to gratify it they will voluntarily relinquish all these\r\nbenefits, and continue to remain in a country where they must continue\r\nto hunt, and make their own living on the unjust plan of free trade in\r\nopen markets!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n                ACCOUNT OF SOME OF THE OLD GRIEVANCES OF\r\n                               THE SIOUX.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW BETWEEN RED IRON, CHIEF OF THE SISSETON SIOUX, AND GOVERNOR\r\nRAMSEY, IN DECEMBER, 1852.\r\n\r\nClaims had been set up by the Indian traders for $400,000 of the money\r\npromised to the Sioux by the treaties of 1851 and 1852. The Indians\r\ndeclared that they did not owe so much. Governor Ramsey endeavored to\r\ncompel Red Iron to sign a receipt for it; he refused. He said his tribe\r\nhad never had the goods. He asked the governor to appoint\r\narbitrators—two white men and one Indian; it was refused. He then said\r\nthat he would accept three white men as arbitrators, if they were honest\r\nmen: this was refused.\r\n\r\nAn eye-witness has sketched the appearance of the chief on that\r\noccasion, and the interview between him and the governor: The council\r\nwas crowded with Indians and white men when Red Iron was brought in,\r\nguarded by soldiers. He was about forty years old, tall and athletic;\r\nabout six feet high in his moccasins, with a large, well-developed head,\r\naquiline nose, thin compressed lips, and physiognomy beaming with\r\nintelligence and resolution. He was clad in the half-military,\r\nhalf-Indian costume of the Dakota chiefs. He was seated in the\r\ncouncil-room without greeting or salutation from any one. In a few\r\nminutes the governor, turning to the chief in the midst of a breathless\r\nsilence, by the aid of an interpreter, opened the council.\r\n\r\nGovernor Ramsey asked: \"What excuse have you for not coming to the\r\ncouncil when I sent for you?\"\r\n\r\nThe chief rose to his feet with native grace and dignity, his blanket\r\nfalling from his shoulders, and purposely dropping the pipe of peace, he\r\nstood erect before the governor with his arms folded, and right hand\r\npressed on the sheath of his scalping-knife; with firm voice he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I started to come, but your braves drove me back.\"\r\n\r\n_Gov._ \"What excuse have you for not coming the second time I sent for\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n_Red Iron._ \"No other excuse than I have given you.\"\r\n\r\n_Gov._ \"At the treaty I thought you a good man, but since you have acted\r\nbadly, and I am disposed to break you. I do break you.\"\r\n\r\n_Red Iron._ \"You break me! My people made me a chief. My people love me.\r\nI will still be their chief. I have done nothing wrong.\"\r\n\r\n_Gov._ \"Why did you get your braves together and march around here for\r\nthe purpose of intimidating other chiefs, and prevent their coming to\r\nthe council?\"\r\n\r\n_Red Iron._ \"I did not get my braves together, they got together\r\nthemselves to prevent boys going to council to be made chiefs, to sign\r\npapers, and to prevent single chiefs going to council at night, to be\r\nbribed to sign papers for money we have never got. We have heard how the\r\nMedewakantons were served at Mendota; that by secret councils you got\r\ntheir names on paper, and took away their money. We don't want to be\r\nserved so. My braves wanted to come to council in the daytime, when the\r\nsun shines, and we want no councils in the dark. We want all our people\r\nto go to council together, so that we can all know what is done.\"\r\n\r\n_Gov._ \"Why did you attempt to come to council with your braves, when I\r\nhad forbidden your braves coming to council?\"\r\n\r\n_Red Iron._ \"You invited the chiefs only, and would not let the braves\r\ncome too. This is not the way we have been treated before; this is not\r\naccording to our customs, for among Dakotas chiefs and braves go to\r\ncouncil together. When you first sent for us, there were two or three\r\nchiefs here, and we wanted to wait till the rest would come, that we\r\nmight all be in council together and know what was done, and so that we\r\nmight all understand the papers, and know what we were signing. When we\r\nsigned the treaty the traders threw a blanket over our faces and\r\ndarkened our eyes, and made us sign papers which we did not understand,\r\nand which were not explained or read to us. We want our Great Father at\r\nWashington to know what has been done.\"\r\n\r\n_Gov._ \"Your Great Father has sent me to represent him, and what I say\r\nis what he says. He wants you to pay your old debts, in accordance with\r\nthe paper you signed when the treaty was made, and to leave that money\r\nin my hands to pay these debts. If you refuse to do that I will take the\r\nmoney back.\"\r\n\r\n_Red Iron._ \"You can take the money back. We sold our land to you, and\r\nyou promised to pay us. If you don't give us the money I will be glad,\r\nand all our people will be glad, for we will have our land back if you\r\ndon't give us the money. That paper was not interpreted or explained to\r\nus. We are told it gives about 300 boxes ($300,000) of our money to some\r\nof the traders. We don't think we owe them so much. We want to pay all\r\nour debts. We want our Great Father to send three good men here to tell\r\nus how much we do owe, and whatever they say we will pay; and that's\r\nwhat all these braves say. Our chiefs and all our people say this.\" All\r\nthe Indians present responded, \"Ho! ho!\"\r\n\r\n_Gov._ \"That can't be done. You owe more than your money will pay, and I\r\nam ready now to pay your annuity, and no more; and when you are ready to\r\nreceive it, the agent will pay you.\"\r\n\r\n_Red Iron._ \"We will receive our annuity, but we will sign no papers for\r\nanything else. The snow is on the ground, and we have been waiting a\r\nlong time to get our money. We are poor; you have plenty. Your fires are\r\nwarm. Your tepees keep out the cold. We have nothing to eat. We have\r\nbeen waiting a long time for our moneys. Our hunting-season is past. A\r\ngreat many of our people are sick, for being hungry. We may die because\r\nyou won't pay us. We may die, but if we do we will leave our bones on\r\nthe ground, that our Great Father may see where his Dakota children\r\ndied. We are very poor. We have sold our hunting-grounds and the graves\r\nof our fathers. We have sold our own graves. We have no place to bury\r\nour dead, and you will not pay us the money for our lands.\"\r\n\r\nThe council was broken up, and Red Iron was sent to the guard-house,\r\nwhere he was kept till next day. Between thirty and forty of the braves\r\nof Red Iron's band were present during this arrangement before the\r\ngovernor. When he was led away, they departed in sullen silence, headed\r\nby Lean Bear, to a spot a quarter of a mile from the council-house,\r\nwhere they uttered a succession of yells—the gathering signal of the\r\nDakotas. Ere the echoes died away, Indians were hurrying from their\r\ntepees toward them, prepared for battle. They proceeded to the eminence\r\nnear the camp, where mouldered the bones of many warriors. It was the\r\nmemorable battle-ground, where their ancestors had fought, in a conflict\r\nlike Waterloo, the warlike Sacs and Foxes, thereby preserving their\r\nlands and nationality. Upon this field stood two hundred resolute\r\nwarriors ready to do battle for their hereditary chief. Lean Bear, the\r\nprincipal brave of Red Iron's band, was a large, resolute man, about\r\nthirty-five years of age, and had great influence in his nation.\r\n\r\nHere, on their old battle-ground, Lean Bear recounted the brave deeds of\r\nRed Iron, the long list of wrongs inflicted on the Indians by the white\r\nmen, and proposed to the braves that they should make a general attack\r\non the whites. By the influence of some of the half-breeds, and of white\r\nmen who were known to be friendly to them, Lean Bear was induced to\r\nabandon his scheme; and finally, the tribe, being starving, consented to\r\ngive up their lands and accept the sum of money offered to them.\r\n\r\n\"Over $55,000 of this treaty money, paid for debts of the Indians, went\r\nto one Hugh Tyler, a stranger in the country, 'for getting the treaties\r\nthrough the Senate, and for necessary disbursements in securing the\r\nassent of the chiefs.'\"\r\n\r\nFive years later another trader, under the pretence that he was going to\r\nget back for them some of this stolen treaty money, obtained their\r\nsignature to vouchers, by means of which he cheated them out of $12,000\r\nmore. At this same time he obtained a payment of $4,500 for goods he\r\nsaid they had stolen from him. Another man was allowed a claim of $5,000\r\nfor horses he said they had stolen from him.\r\n\r\n\"In 1858 the chiefs were taken to Washington, and agreed to the treaties\r\nfor the cession of all their reservation north of the Minnesota River,\r\nunder which, as ratified by the Senate, they were to have $166,000; but\r\nof this amount they never received one penny till four years afterward,\r\nwhen $15,000 in goods were sent to the Lower Sioux, and these were\r\ndeducted out of what was due them under former treaties.\"—_History of\r\nthe Sioux War_, by ISAAC V. D. HEARD.\r\n\r\nThis paragraph gives the causes of the fearful Minnesota massacre, in\r\nwhich eight hundred people lost their lives.\r\n\r\nThe treaty expressly provided that no claims against the Indians should\r\nbe paid unless approved by the Indians in open council. No such council\r\nwas held. A secret council was held with a few chiefs, but the body of\r\nthe Indians were ignorant of it. There was a clause in this treaty that\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior might use any funds of the Indians for\r\nsuch purposes of civilization as his judgment should dictate. Under this\r\nclause the avails of over six hundred thousand acres of land were taken\r\nfor claims against the Indians. Of the vast amount due to the Lower\r\nSioux, only a little over $800 was left to their credit in Washington at\r\nthe time of the outbreak. Moreover, a portion of their annual annuity\r\nwas also taken for claims.\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF THE SIOUX AND WINNEBAGOES FROM MINNESOTA in 1863.\r\n\r\n\"The guard that accompanied these Indians consisted of four commissioned\r\nofficers, one hundred and thirty-five soldiers, and one laundress; in\r\nall, one hundred and forty persons. The number of Santee Sioux\r\ntransported was thirteen hundred and eighteen. For the transportation\r\nand subsistence of these Indians and the guard there was paid the sum of\r\n$36,322.10.\r\n\r\n\"The number of Winnebagoes transported was nineteen hundred and\r\nforty-five; for their transportation and subsistence there was paid the\r\nfarther sum of $56,042.60—making the whole amount paid the contractors\r\n$92,364.70.\r\n\r\n\"The Sioux were transported from Fort Snelling to Hannibal, Missouri, on\r\ntwo steamboats. One of the boats stopped there, and the Indians on it\r\ncrossed over to St. Joseph, on the Missouri River, by rail. The other\r\nboat continued to the junction of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers,\r\nand thence up the latter to St. Joseph; and here the Indians that\r\ncrossed over by rail were put upon the boat, and from thence to Crow\r\nCreek all of them were on one boat. They were very much crowded from St.\r\nJoseph to Crow Creek. Sixteen died on the way, being without attention\r\nor medical supplies. All the Indians were excluded from the cabin of the\r\nboat, and confined to the lower and upper decks. It was in May, and to\r\ngo among them on the lower deck was suffocating. They were fed on hard\r\nbread and mess pork, much of it not cooked, there being no opportunity\r\nto cook it only at night when the boat laid up. They had no sugar,\r\ncoffee, or vegetables. Confinement on the boat in such a mass, and want\r\nof proper food, created much sickness, such as diarrhœa and fevers. For\r\nweeks after they arrived at Crow Creek the Indians died at the rate of\r\nfrom three to four per day. In a few weeks one hundred and fifty had\r\ndied, mainly on account of the treatment they had received after leaving\r\nFort Snelling.\"—_MANEYPENNY, Our Indian Wards._\r\n\r\nFOOD OF THE INDIANS AT CROW CREEK, DAKOTA, IN THE WINTER OF 1864.\r\n\r\n\"During the summer the Indians were fed on flour and pork; they got no\r\nbeef till fall. They suffered for want of fresh beef as well as for\r\nmedical supplies. In the fall their ration began to fail; and the issue\r\nwas gradually reduced; and the Indians complained bitterly. *** The beef\r\nfurnished was from the cattle that hauled the supplies from Minnesota.\r\nThese cattle had travelled over three hundred miles, hauling the train,\r\nwith nothing to eat but the dry prairie grass, there being no\r\nsettlements on the route they came. The cattle were very poor. Some died\r\nor gave out on the trip, and such were slaughtered, and the meat brought\r\nin on the train for food for the Indians. About the 1st of January,\r\n1864, near four hundred of the cattle were slaughtered. Except the dry\r\nprairie grass, which the frost had killed, these cattle had no food from\r\nthe time they came to Crow Creek until they were slaughtered. A part of\r\nthe beef thus made was piled up in the warehouse in snow, and the\r\nremainder in like manner packed in snow outside. This beef was to keep\r\nthe Indians until the coming June. The beef was black, and very poor—the\r\ngreater part only skin and bone. Shortly after the arrival of the train\r\nfrom Minnesota the contractors for supplying the Indians with flour took\r\nabout one hundred head of the oxen, selecting the best of them, yoked\r\nthem up, and sent them with wagons to Sioux City, some two hundred and\r\nforty miles, to haul up flour. This train returned in February, and\r\nthese oxen were then slaughtered, and fed to the Indians.\r\n\r\n\"In January the issue of soup to the Indians commenced. It was made in a\r\nlarge cotton-wood vat, being cooked by steam carried from the boiler of\r\nthe saw-mill in a pipe to the vat. The vat was partly filled with water,\r\nthen several quarters of beef chopped up were thrown into it, and a few\r\nsacks of flour added. The hearts, lights, and entrails were added to the\r\ncompound, and in the beginning a few beans were put into the vat; but\r\nthis luxury did not continue long. This soup was issued every other\r\nday—to the Santee Sioux one day, the alternate day to the Winnebagoes.\r\nIt was very unpalatable. On the day the Indians received the soup they\r\nhad no other food issued to them. They were very much dissatisfied, and\r\nsaid they could not live on the soup, when those in charge told them if\r\nthey could live elsewhere they had better go, but that they must not go\r\nto the white settlements. Many of them did leave the agency, some going\r\nto Fort Sully, others to Fort Randall, in search of food. From a\r\ndescription of this nauseous mess called soup, given by Samuel C.\r\nHaynes, then at Fort Randall, and assistant-surgeon in the military\r\nservice, it is seen that the Indians had good cause to leave Crow Creek.\r\nHe states that there were thrown into the vat 'beef, beef-heads,\r\nentrails of the beeves, some beans, flour, and pork. I think there were\r\nput into the vat two barrels of flour each time, which was not oftener\r\nthan once in twenty-four hours. This mass was then cooked by the steam\r\nfrom the boiler passing through the pipe into the vat. When that was\r\ndone, all the Indians were ordered to come with their pails and get it.\r\nIt was dipped out to the Indians with a long-handled dipper made for the\r\npurpose. I cannot say the quantity given to each. It was about the\r\nconsistency of very thin gruel. The Indians would pour off the thinner\r\nportion and eat that which settled at the bottom. As it was dipped out\r\nof the vat, some of the Indians would get the thinner portions and some\r\nwould get some meat. I passed there frequently when it was cooking, and\r\nwas often there when it was being issued. It had a very offensive odor.\r\nIt had the odor of the contents of the entrails of the beeves. I have\r\nseen the settlings of the vat after they were through issuing it to the\r\nIndians, when they were cleaning the vat, and the settlings smelled like\r\ncarrion—like decomposed meat. Some of the Indians refused to eat it,\r\nsaying they could not, it made them sick.'\"—_MANEYPENNY, Our Indian\r\nWards._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII.\r\n\r\n                     LETTER FROM SARAH WINNEMUCCA,\r\n\r\n                       AN EDUCATED PAH-UTE WOMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _To Major H. Douglas, U. S. Army_:\r\n\r\nSIR,—I learn from the commanding officer at this post that you desire\r\nfull information in regard to the Indians around this place, with a\r\nview, if possible, of bettering their condition by sending them on the\r\nTruckee River Reservation. All the Indians from here to Carson City\r\nbelong to the Pah-Ute tribe. My father, whose name is Winnemucca, is the\r\nhead chief of the whole tribe; but he is now getting too old, and has\r\nnot energy enough to command, nor to impress on their minds the\r\nnecessity of their being sent on the reservation. In fact, I think he is\r\nentirely opposed to it. He, myself, and most of the Humboldt and Queen's\r\nRiver Indians were on the Truckee Reservation at one time; but if we had\r\nstayed there, it would be only to starve. I think that if they had\r\nreceived what they were entitled to from the agents, they would never\r\nhave left them. So far as their knowledge of agriculture extends, they\r\nare quite ignorant, as they have never had the opportunity of learning;\r\nbut I think, if proper pains were taken, that they would willingly make\r\nthe effort to maintain themselves by their own labor, providing they\r\ncould be made to believe that the products were their own, for their own\r\nuse and comfort. It is needless for me to enter into details as to how\r\nwe were treated on the reservation while there. It is enough to say that\r\nwe were confined to the reserve, and had to live on what fish we might\r\nbe able to catch in the river. If this is the kind of civilization\r\nawaiting us on the reserves, God grant that we may never be compelled to\r\ngo on one, as it is much preferable to live in the mountains and drag\r\nout an existence in our native manner. So far as living is concerned,\r\nthe Indians at all military posts get enough to eat and considerable\r\ncast-off clothing.\r\n\r\nBut how long is this to continue? What is the object of the Government\r\nin regard to Indians? Is it enough that we are at peace? Remove all the\r\nIndians from the military posts and place them on reservations such as\r\nthe Truckee and Walker River Reservations (as they were conducted), and\r\nit will require a greater military force stationed round to keep them\r\nwithin the limits than it now does to keep them in subjection. On the\r\nother hand, if the Indians have any guarantee that they can secure a\r\npermanent home on their own native soil, and that our white neighbors\r\ncan be kept from encroaching on our rights, after having a reasonable\r\nshare of ground allotted to us as our own, and giving us the required\r\nadvantages of learning, I warrant that the savage (as he is called\r\nto-day) will be a thrifty and law-abiding member of the community\r\nfifteen or twenty years hence.\r\n\r\nSir, if at any future time you should require information regarding the\r\nIndians here, I will be happy to furnish the same if I can.\r\n\r\n                                                       SARAH WINNEMUCCA.\r\n\r\nCamp McDermitt, Nevada, April 4th, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n\r\n                LAWS OF THE DELAWARE NATION OF INDIANS.\r\n\r\n[Adopted July 21st, A.D. 1866.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chiefs and councillors of the Delaware tribe of Indians convened at\r\ntheir council-house, on the reservation of said tribe, adopted July\r\n21st, 1866, the following laws, to be amended as they think proper:\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.\r\n\r\n_Section 1._ A national jail shall be built on the public grounds, upon\r\nwhich the council-house is now situated.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 2._ Any person who shall steal any horse, mule, ass, or cattle of\r\nany kind, shall be punished as follows: For the first offence the\r\nproperty of the offender shall be sold by the sheriff, to pay the owner\r\nof the animal stolen the price of said animal, and all costs he may\r\nsustain in consequence of such theft.

If any animal shall break through or over a lawful fence, as\r\nabove defined, and do any damage, the owner of the enclosure shall give\r\nnotice thereof to the owner of such animal, without injury to the\r\nanimal. The owner of such animal shall therefore take care of the same,\r\nand prevent his doing damage; but should he neglect or refuse so to do,\r\nthe animal itself shall be sold to pay for the damage it may have done.\r\nBut if the premises be not enclosed by a lawful fence, as above defined,\r\nthe owner of the enclosure shall receive no damages; but should he\r\ninjure any animal getting into such enclosure, shall pay for any damage\r\nhe may do such animal.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 10._ Every owner of stock shall have his or her brand or mark put\r\non such stock, and a description of the brand or mark of every person in\r\nthe tribe shall be recorded by the national clerk.\r\n\r\nARTICLE II.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 1._ Whoever shall maliciously set fire to a house shall, for the\r\nfirst offence, pay to the owner of such house all damages which he may\r\nsustain in consequence of such fire; and, in addition thereto, for the\r\nsecond offence shall be confined in jail for the term of twenty-one\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 2._ Should human life be sacrificed in consequence of any such\r\nfire, the person setting fire as aforesaid shall suffer death by\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 3._ It shall be unlawful for any person to set on fire any woods\r\nor prairie, except for the purpose of protecting property, and then only\r\nat such times as shall permit the person so setting the fire to\r\nextinguish the same.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 4._ Whoever shall violate the provisions of the last preceding\r\nsection shall, for the first offence, be fined the sum of five dollars,\r\nand pay the full value of all property thereby destroyed; for the second\r\noffence, in addition to the penalty above described, the offender shall\r\nbe confined in jail for the term of thirty-five days; and for the third\r\noffence the same punishment, except that the confinement in jail shall\r\nbe for the period of three months.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 5._ Any person living outside of the reserve cutting hay upon the\r\nland of one living on the reserve, shall pay to the owner of such land\r\nthe sum of one dollar per acre, or one-half of the hay so cut.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 6._ No person shall sell any wood on the reserve, except said wood\r\nbe first cut and corded.\r\n\r\nARTICLE III.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 1._ Whoever shall find any lost article shall forthwith return the\r\nsame to the owner, if he can be found, under the penalty imposed for\r\nstealing such article, for a neglect of such duty.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 2._ Whoever shall take any article of property without permission\r\nof its owner shall pay the price of the article so taken, and receive\r\nsuch punishment as the judge in his discretion may impose.\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 1._ Whoever shall take up any animal on the reserve as a stray\r\nshall, within one week, have the description of such animal recorded in\r\nthe stray-book kept by the council.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 2._ If the owner of said stray shall claim the same within one\r\nyear from the day on which the description was recorded, he shall be\r\nentitled to take it, after duly proving his property, and paying at the\r\nrate of five dollars per month for the keeping of such animal.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 3._ The title to any stray, duly recorded, and not claimed within\r\none year from the date of such record, shall rest absolutely in the\r\nperson taking up and recording the same.\r\n\r\n_Sec. 4._ Whoever shall take up a stray, and refuse or neglect to record\r\na description of the same, as provided in Section 1 of this Article,\r\nshall be deemed to have stolen such animal, if the same be found in his\r\npossession, and shall suffer the penalties inflicted for stealing like\r\nanimals.

He also assisted in the\r\nmanagement of his mother's property, consisting of a farm and cattle and\r\nhorses. In his intercourse with the whites he became aware that they\r\npossessed an art by which a name impressed upon a hard substance might\r\nbe understood at a glance by any one acquainted with the art. He\r\nrequested an educated half-breed, named Charles Hicks, to write his\r\nname; which being done, he made a die containing a fac-simile of the\r\nword, which he stamped upon all the articles fabricated by his\r\nmechanical ingenuity. From this he proceeded to the art of drawing, in\r\nwhich he made rapid progress before he had the opportunity of seeing a\r\npicture or engraving. These accomplishments made the young man very\r\npopular among his associates, and particularly among the red ladies; but\r\nit was long before incessant adulation produced any evil effect upon his\r\ncharacter. At length, however, he was prevailed upon to join his\r\ncompanions, and share in the carouse which had been supplied by his own\r\nindustry. But he soon wearied of an idle and dissipated life, suddenly\r\nresolved to give up drinking, and learned the trade of a blacksmith by\r\nhis own unaided efforts. In the year 1820, while on a visit to some\r\nfriends in a Cherokee village, he listened to a conversation on the art\r\nof writing, which seems always to have been the subject of great\r\ncuriosity among the Indians. Sequoyah remarked that he did not regard\r\nthe art as so very extraordinary, and believed he could invent a plan by\r\nwhich the red man might do the same thing. The company were incredulous;\r\nbut the matter had long been the subject of his reflections, and he had\r\ncome to the conclusion that letters represented words or ideas, and\r\nbeing always uniform, would always convey the same meaning. His first\r\nplan was to invent signs for words; but upon trial he was speedily\r\nsatisfied that this would be too cumbrous and laborious, and he soon\r\ncontrived the plan of an alphabet which should represent sounds, each\r\ncharacter standing for a syllable. He persevered in carrying out his\r\nintention, and attained his object by forming eighty-six characters.\r\n\r\n\"While thus employed he incurred the ridicule of his neighbors, and was\r\nentreated to desist by his friends. The invention, however, was\r\ncompletely successful, and the Cherokee dialect is now a written\r\nlanguage; a result entirely due to the extraordinary genius of Sequoyah.\r\nAfter teaching many to read and write, he left the Cherokee nation in\r\n1822 on a visit to Arkansas, and introduced the art among the Cherokees\r\nwho had emigrated to that country; and, after his return home, a\r\ncorrespondence was opened in the Cherokee language between the two\r\nbranches of the nation. In the autumn of 1823 the General Council\r\nbestowed upon him a silver medal in honor of his genius, and as an\r\nexpression of gratitude for his eminent public services.\"—_North\r\nAmerican Review._\r\n\r\n\"We may remark, with reference to the above, that as each letter of this\r\nalphabet represents one of eighty-six sounds, of which in various\r\ntranspositions the language is composed, a Cherokee can read as soon as\r\nhe has learned his alphabet. It is said that a clever boy may thus be\r\ntaught to read in a single day.\"—_The Saturday Magazine_, London, April,\r\n1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X.\r\n\r\n                  PRICES PAID BY WHITE MEN FOR SCALPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the wars between France and England and their colonies, their\r\nIndian allies were entitled to a premium for every scalp of an enemy.\r\nIn the war preceding 1703 the Government of Massachusetts gave twelve\r\npounds for every Indian scalp.

But in\r\neither case the device was a futile one. The massacre will be known as\r\n\"The Chivington Massacre\" as long as history lasts, and the United\r\nStates must bear its share of the infamy of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII.\r\n\r\n                   WOOD-CUTTING BY INDIANS IN DAKOTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his report for 1877 the Superintendent of Indian Affairs in Dakota\r\nsays: \"Orders have been received to stop cutting of wood by Indians, to\r\npay them for what they have already cut, to take possession of it and\r\nsell it. This I am advised is under a recent decision which deprives\r\nIndians of any ownership in the wood until the land is taken by them in\r\nseveralty. If agents do not enforce these orders, they lay themselves\r\nliable. If they do enforce them, the Indians are deprived of what little\r\nmotive they have for labor. In the mean time, aliens of all nations cut\r\nwood on Indian lands, sell to steamboats, fill contracts for the army\r\nand for Indian agencies at high prices. *** Cutting wood is one of the\r\nvery few things an Indian can do in Dakota at this time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XIII.\r\n\r\n                  SEQUEL TO THE WALLA WALLA MASSACRE.\r\n\r\n[This narrative was written by a well-known army officer, correspondent\r\nof the _Army and Navy Journal_, and appeared in that paper Nov. 1st,\r\n1879.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of that affair (the Walla Walla Massacre) was never written,\r\nwe believe; or, if it was, the absolute facts in the case were never\r\ngiven by any unprejudiced person, and it may be interesting to not a few\r\nto give them here. The story, as told by our Washington correspondent,\r\n\"Ebbitt,\" who was a witness of the scenes narrated, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The first settlements in Oregon, some thirty years ago, were made by a\r\ncolony of Methodists. One of the principal men among them was the late\r\nMr. or Governor Abernethy, as he was called, as he was for a short time\r\nthe prominent Governor of Oregon. He was the father-in-law of our genial\r\nDeputy Quartermaster-general Henry C. Hodges, an excellent man, and he\r\nmust not be remembered as one of those who were responsible for the\r\nshocking proceedings which we are about to relate. A minister by the\r\nname of Whitman, we believe, had gone up to the Walla Walla region,\r\nwhere he was kindly received by the Cayuse and other friendly Indians,\r\nwho, while they did not particularly desire to be converted to the\r\nChristian faith as expounded by one of Wesley's followers, saw no\r\nspecial objection to the presence of the missionary. So they lived\r\nquietly along for a year or two; then the measles broke out among the\r\nIndians, and a large number of them were carried off. They were told by\r\ntheir medicine men that the disease was owing to the presence of the\r\nwhites, and Mr. Whitman was notified that he must leave their country.\r\nFilled with zeal for the cause, and not having sense enough to grasp the\r\nsituation, he refused to go.\r\n\r\n\"At this time the people of the Hudson's Bay Company had great influence\r\nwith all the Indians in that region, and the good old Governor Peter\r\nSkeen Ogden was the chief factor of the Company at Fort Vancouver. He\r\nwas apprised of the state of feeling among the Indians near the mission\r\nby the Indians themselves, and he was entreated by them to urge Whitman\r\nto go away, for if he did not he would surely be killed. The governor\r\nwrote up to the mission advising them to leave, for a while at least,\r\nuntil the Indians should become quiet, which they would do as soon as\r\nthe measles had run its course among them. His efforts were useless, and\r\nsure enough one day in 1847, we believe, the mission was cleaned out,\r\nthe missionary and nearly all of those connected with it being killed.\r\n\r\n\"An Indian war follows. This was carried on for some months, and with\r\nlittle damage, but sufficient for a claim by the territory upon the\r\nGeneral Government for untold amounts of money. Two or three years\r\nlater, when the country had commenced to fill up with emigration, and\r\nafter the regiment of Mounted Riflemen and two companies of the First\r\nArtillery had taken post in Oregon, the people began to think that it\r\nwould be well to stir up the matter of the murder of the Whitman family.\r\nGeneral Joseph Lane had been sent out as governor in 1849, and he\r\ndoubtless thought it would be a good thing for him politically to humor\r\nthe people of the territory. Lane was a vigorous, resolute, Western man,\r\nwho had been a general officer during the Mexican war, and he then had\r\nPresidential aspirations. So the governor came to Fort Vancouver, where\r\nthe head-quarters of the department were established, under Colonel\r\nLoring, of the Mounted Rifles, and procured a small escort, with which\r\nhe proceeded to hunt up the Indians concerned in the massacre, and\r\ndemand their surrender. By this time the Indians had begun to comprehend\r\nthe power of the Government; and when the governor found them, and\r\nexplained the nature of his mission, they went into council to decide\r\nwhat was to be done. After due deliberation, they were convinced that if\r\nthey were to refuse to come to any terms they would be attacked by the\r\nsoldiers, of whom they then had deadly fear, and obliged to abandon\r\ntheir country forever. So they met the governor, and the head chief said\r\nthat they had heard what he had to say. It was true that his people had\r\nkilled the whites at the mission, but that they did so for the reason\r\nthat they really thought that a terrible disease had been brought among\r\nthem by the whites; that they had begged them to go away from them, for\r\nthey did not wish to kill them, and that they only killed them to save\r\ntheir own lives, as they thought. He said that for this the whites from\r\ndown the Columbia had made war upon them, and killed many more of their\r\npeople than had been killed at the mission, and they thought they ought\r\nto be satisfied. As they were not, three of their principal men had\r\nvolunteered to go back with the governor to Oregon City to be tried for\r\nthe murder. This satisfied the governor, and the men bid farewell to\r\ntheir wives and little ones and to all their tribe, for they very well\r\nknew that they would never see them again. They knew that they were\r\ngoing among those who thirsted for their blood, and that they were going\r\nto their death, and that death the most ignominious that can be accorded\r\nto the red man, as they were to be hung like dogs.\r\n\r\n\"The governor and his party left. The victims gave one long last look at\r\nthe shore as they took the little boat on the Columbia, but no word of\r\ncomplaint ever came from their lips. When they arrived at Fort Vancouver\r\nwe had charge of these Indians. They were not restrained in any way—no\r\nguard was ever kept over them, for there was no power on earth that\r\ncould have made them falter in their determination to go down to Oregon\r\nCity, and die like men for the salvation of their tribe.\r\n\r\n\"At Oregon City these men walked with their heads erect, and with the\r\nbearing of senators, from the little boat, amidst the jibes and jeers of\r\na brutal crowd, to the jail which was to be the last covering they would\r\never have over their heads.\r\n\r\n\"The trial came on, the jury was empanelled, and Captain Claiborne, of\r\nthe Mounted Rifles, volunteered to defend the Indians, who were told\r\nthat they were to have a fair trial, and that they would not be punished\r\nunless they were found guilty. To all this they paid no heed. They said\r\nit was all right, but they did not understand a word of what they were\r\ncompelled to listen to for several days, and they cared nothing for the\r\nforms of the law. They had come to die, and when some witnesses swore\r\nthat they recognized them as the very Indians who killed Whitman—all of\r\nwhich was explained to them—not a muscle of their faces changed,\r\nalthough it was more than suspected that the witnesses were never near\r\nthe mission at the time of the massacre. The trial was over, and, of\r\ncourse, the Indians were condemned to be hanged. Without a murmur or\r\nsigh of regret, and with a dignity that would have impressed a Zulu with\r\nprofound pity, these men walked to the gallows and were hung, while a\r\ncrowd of civilized Americans—men, women, and children of the nineteenth\r\ncentury—looked on and laughed at their last convulsive twitches.\r\n\r\n\"We have read of heroes of all times, but never did we read of or\r\nbelieve that such heroism as these Indians exhibited could exist. They\r\nknew that to be accused was to be condemned, and they would be executed\r\nin the civilized town of Oregon City just as surely as would a poor\r\nwoman accused of being a witch have been executed in the civilized and\r\nChristian town of Salem, in the good State of Massachusetts, two hundred\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n\"A generation has passed away since the execution or murder of these\r\nIndians at Oregon City. Governor Lane still lives, not as ex-President,\r\nbut as a poor but vigorous old man down in the Rogue River Valley. The\r\nlittle nasty town of Oregon City was the scene of a self-immolation as\r\ngreat as any of which we read in history, and there were not three\r\npersons there who appreciated it. The accursed town is, we hear, still\r\nnastier than ever, and the intelligent jury—no man of whom dared to have\r\na word of pity or admiration for those poor Indians—with the spectators\r\nof that horrid scene, are either dead and damned, or they are sunk in\r\nthe oblivion that is the fate of those who are born without souls.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV.\r\n\r\n                               AN ACCOUNT\r\n\r\n\r\n         OF THE NUMBERS, LOCATION, AND SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL\r\n         CONDITION OF EACH IMPORTANT TRIBE AND BAND OF INDIANS\r\n         WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE EXCEPTION\r\n         OF THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS PAGES.\r\n\r\n[From the Report of Francis A. Walker, United States Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs for the year 1872.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indians within the limits of the United States, exclusive of those\r\nin Alaska, number, approximately, 300,000.\r\n\r\nThey may be divided, according to their geographical location or range,\r\ninto five grand divisions, as follows: in Minnesota, and States east of\r\nthe Mississippi River, about 32,500; in Nebraska, Kansas, and the Indian\r\nTerritory, 70,650; in the Territories of Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and\r\nIdaho, 65,000; in Nevada, and the Territories of Colorado, New Mexico,\r\nUtah, and Arizona, 84,000; and on the Pacific slope, 48,000. *** As\r\nregards their means of support and methods of subsistence, they may be\r\ndivided as follows: those who support themselves upon their own\r\nreservations, receiving nothing from the Government except interest on\r\ntheir own moneys, or annuities granted them in consideration of the\r\ncession of their lands to the United States, number about 130,000; those\r\nwho are entirely subsisted by the Government, about 31,000; those in\r\npart subsisted, 84,000,—together, about 115,000; those who subsist by\r\nhunting and fishing, upon roots, nuts, berries, etc., or by begging and\r\nstealing, about 55,000.\r\n\r\nTRIBES EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of New York, remnants of the once powerful \"Six Nations,\"\r\nnumber 5070. They occupy six reservations in the State, containing in\r\nthe aggregate 68,668 acres. Two of these reservations, viz., the\r\nAlleghany and Cattaraugus, belonged originally to the Colony of\r\nMassachusetts; but, by sale and assignment, passed into the hands of a\r\ncompany, the Indians holding a perpetual right of occupancy, and the\r\ncompany referred to, or the individual members thereof, owning the\r\nultimate fee. The same state of facts formerly existed in regard to the\r\nTonawanda reserve; but the Indians who occupy it have purchased the\r\nultimate fee of a portion of the reserve, which is now held in trust for\r\nthem by the Secretary of the Interior. The State of New York exercises\r\nsovereignty over these reservations. The reservations occupied by the\r\nOneidas, Onondagas, and Tuscaroras have been provided for by treaty\r\nstipulations between the Indians and the State of New York. All six\r\nreserves are held and occupied by the Indians in common. While the\r\nIndian tribes of the continent, with few exceptions, have been steadily\r\ndecreasing in numbers, those of New York have of late more than held\r\ntheir own, as is shown by an increase of 100 in the present reports over\r\nthe reported number in 1871, and of 1300 over the number embraced in the\r\nUnited States census of 1860. On the New York reservations are\r\ntwenty-eight schools; the attendance during some portions of the past\r\nyear exceeding 1100; the daily average attendance being 608. Of the\r\nteachers employed, fifteen are Indians, as fully competent for this\r\nposition as their white associates. An indication of what is to be\r\naccomplished in the future, in an educational point of view, is found in\r\nthe successful effort, made in August last, to establish a teacher's\r\ninstitute on the Cattaraugus Reservation for the education of teachers\r\nspecially for Indian schools. Thirty-eight applicants attended, and\r\ntwenty-six are now under training. The statistics of individual wealth\r\nand of the aggregate product of agricultural and other industry are, in\r\ngeneral, favorable; and a considerable increase in these regards is\r\nobserved from year to year. Twenty thousand acres are under cultivation;\r\nthe cereal crops are good; while noticeable success has been achieved in\r\nthe raising of fruit.\r\n\r\nMICHIGAN.\r\n\r\nThe bands or tribes residing in Michigan are the Chippewas of Saginaw,\r\nSwan Creek, and Black River; the Ottawas and Chippewas; the\r\nPottawattomies of Huron; and the L'Anse band of Chippewas.\r\n\r\n_The Chippewas_ of Saginaw, Swan Creek, and Black River, numbering 1630,\r\nand the Ottawas and Chippewas, 6039, are indigenous to the country. They\r\nare well advanced in civilization; have, with few exceptions, been\r\nallotted lands under treaty provisions, for which they have received\r\npatents; and are now entitled to all the privileges and benefits of\r\ncitizens of the United States. Those to whom no allotments have been\r\nmade can secure homesteads under the provisions of the Act of June 10th,\r\n1872. All treaty stipulations with these Indians have expired. They now\r\nhave no money or other annuities paid to them by the United States\r\nGovernment. The three tribes first named have in all four schools, with\r\n115 scholars; and the last, two schools, with 152 scholars.\r\n\r\n_The Pottawattomies_ of Huron number about fifty.\r\n\r\n_The L'Anse_ band of Chippewas, numbering 1195, belong with the other\r\nbands of the Chippewas of Lake Superior. They occupy a reservation of\r\nabout 48,300 acres, situated on Lake Superior, in the extreme northern\r\npart of the State. But few of them are engaged in agriculture, most of\r\nthem depending for their subsistence on hunting and fishing. They have\r\ntwo schools, with an attendance of fifty-six scholars.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Indians of Michigan in civilization and industry has\r\nbeen greatly hindered in the past by a feeling of uncertainty in regard\r\nto their permanent possession and enjoyment of their homes. Since the\r\nallotment of land, and the distribution of either patents or homestead\r\ncertificates to these Indians (the L'Anse or Lake Superior Chippewas, a\r\npeople of hunting and fishing habits, excepted), a marked improvement\r\nhas been manifested on their part in regard to breaking land and\r\nbuilding houses. The aggregate quantity of land cultivated by the\r\nseveral tribes is 11,620 acres—corn, oats, and wheat being the chief\r\nproducts. The dwellings occupied consist of 244 frame and 835\r\nlog-houses. The aggregate population of the several tribes named\r\n(including the confederated \"Chippewas, Ottawas, and Pottawattomies,\"\r\nabout 250 souls, with whom the Government made a final settlement in\r\n1866 of its treaty obligations) is, by the report of their agent for the\r\ncurrent year, 9117—an increase over the number reported for 1871 of 402;\r\ndue, however, perhaps as much to the return of absent Indians as to the\r\nexcess of births over deaths. In educational matters these Indians have,\r\nof late, most unfortunately, fallen short of the results of former\r\nyears; for the reason mainly that, their treaties expiring, the\r\nprovisions previously existing for educational uses failed.\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nThe bands or tribes in Wisconsin are the Chippewas of Lake Superior, the\r\nMenomonees, the Stockbridges, and Munsees, the Oneidas, and certain\r\nstray bands (so-called) of Winnebagoes, Pottawattomies, and Chippewas.\r\n\r\n_The Chippewas_ of Lake Superior (under which head are included the\r\nfollowing bands: Fond du Lac, Boise Forte, Grand Portage, Red Cliff, Bad\r\nRiver, Lac de Flambeau, and Lac Court D'Oreille) number about 5150. They\r\nconstitute a part of the Ojibways (anglicized in the term Chippewas),\r\nformerly one of the most powerful and warlike nations in the north-west,\r\nembracing many bands, and ranging over an immense territory, extending\r\nalong the shores of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior to the steppes\r\nof the Upper Mississippi. Of this great nation large numbers are still\r\nfound in Minnesota, many in Michigan, and a fragment in Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe bands above mentioned by name are at present located on several\r\nsmall reservations set apart for them by treaties of September 30th,\r\n1854, and April 7th, 1866, in Wisconsin and Minnesota, comprising in all\r\nabout 695,290 acres. By Act of Congress of May 29th, 1872, provision was\r\nmade for the sale, with the consent of the Indians, of three of these\r\nreservations, _viz._, the Lac de Flambeau and Lac Court D'Oreille in\r\nWisconsin, and the Fond du Lac in Minnesota; and for the removal of the\r\nIndians located thereon to the Bad River Reservation, where there is\r\nplenty of good arable land, and where they can be properly cared for,\r\nand instructed in agriculture and mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of these Indians at present lead a somewhat roving\r\nlife, finding their subsistence chiefly in game hunted by them, in the\r\nrice gathered in its wild state, and in the fish afforded by waters\r\nconveniently near. Comparatively little is done in the way of\r\ncultivating the soil. Certain bands have of late been greatly\r\ndemoralized by contact with persons employed in the construction of the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad, the line of which runs near one (the Fond du\r\nLac) of their reservations. Portions of this people, however, especially\r\nthose situated at the Bad River Reservation, have begun to evince an\r\nearnest desire for self-improvement. Many live in houses of rude\r\nconstruction, and raise small crops of grain and vegetables; others\r\nlabor among the whites; and a number find employment in cutting rails,\r\nfence-posts, and saw-logs for the Government. In regard to the efforts\r\nmade to instruct the children in letters, it may be said that, without\r\nbeing altogether fruitless, the results have been thus far meagre and\r\nsomewhat discouraging. The majority of the parents profess to wish to\r\nhave their children educated, and ask for schools; but when the means\r\nare provided and the work undertaken, the difficulties in the way of\r\nsuccess to any considerable extent appear in the undisciplined character\r\nof the scholars, which has to be overcome by the teacher without\r\nparental co-operation, and in the great irregularity of attendance at\r\nschool, especially on the part of those who are obliged to accompany\r\ntheir parents to the rice-fields, the sugar-camps, or the\r\nfishing-grounds.\r\n\r\n_The Menomonees_ number 1362, and are located on a reservation of\r\n230,400 acres in the north-eastern part of Wisconsin. They formerly\r\nowned most of the eastern portion of the State, and, by treaty entered\r\ninto with the Government on the 18th of October, 1848, ceded the same\r\nfor a home in Minnesota upon lands that had been obtained by the United\r\nStates from the Chippewas; but, becoming dissatisfied with the\r\narrangement, as not having accorded them what they claimed to be\r\nrightfully due, subsequently protested, and manifested great\r\nunwillingness to remove. In view of this condition of affairs, they\r\nwere, by the President, permitted to remain in Wisconsin, and\r\ntemporarily located upon the lands they now occupy, which were secured\r\nto them by a subsequent treaty made with the tribe on the 12th of May,\r\n1854. This reservation is well watered by lakes and streams, the latter\r\naffording excellent power and facilities for moving logs and lumber to\r\nmarket; the most of their country abounding with valuable pine timber. A\r\nconsiderable portion of the Menomonees have made real and substantial\r\nadvancement in civilization; numbers of them are engaged in agriculture;\r\nothers find remunerative employment in the lumbering camp established\r\nupon their reservation, under the management of the Government Agent,\r\nwhile a few still return at times to their old pursuits of hunting and\r\nfishing.\r\n\r\nUnder the plan adopted by the Department in 1871, in regard to cutting\r\nand selling the pine timber belonging to these Indians, 2,000,000 feet\r\nhave been cut and driven, realizing $23,731, of which individual Indians\r\nreceived for their labor over $3000, the treasury of the tribe deriving\r\na net profit of five dollars per thousand feet. The agent estimates\r\nthat, for labor done by the Indians upon the reservation, at lumbering,\r\nand for work outside on railroads, during the past year, about $20,000\r\nhas been earned and received, exclusive of the labor rendered in\r\nbuilding houses, raising crops, making sugar, gathering rice, and\r\nhunting for peltries. The work of education upon the reservations has\r\nbeen of late quite unsatisfactory, but one small school being now in\r\noperation, with seventy scholars, the average attendance being fifty.\r\n\r\n_The Stockbridges and Munsees_, numbering 250, occupy a reservation of\r\n60,800 acres adjoining the Menomonees. The Stockbridges came originally\r\nfrom Massachusetts and New York. After several removals, they, with the\r\nMunsees, finally located on their present reservation. Under the\r\nprovisions of the Act of February 6th, 1871, steps are now being taken\r\nto dispose of all of their reservation, with the exception of eighteen\r\nsections best adapted for agricultural purposes, which are reserved for\r\ntheir future use. They have no treaty stipulations with the United\r\nStates at the present time; nor do they receive any annuities of any\r\nkind from the Government. These tribes—indeed it may be said this tribe\r\n(the Stockbridges), for of the Munsees there probably remain not more\r\nthan half a dozen souls—were formerly an intelligent, prosperous people,\r\nnot a whit behind the most advanced of the race, possessed of good\r\nfarms, well instructed, and industrious. Unfortunately for them, though\r\nmuch to the advantage of the Government, which acquired thereby a\r\nvaluable tract of country for white settlement, they removed, in 1857,\r\nto their present place of abode. The change has proved highly\r\ndetrimental to their interests and prospects. Their new reservation, the\r\ngreater part poor in soil and seriously affected by wet seasons and\r\nfrequent frosts, has never yielded them more than a meagre subsistence.\r\nMany have for this reason left the tribe, and have been for years\r\nendeavoring to obtain a livelihood among the whites, maintaining but\r\nlittle intercourse with those remaining on the reservation, yet still\r\nholding their rights in the tribal property. The result has been\r\nbickerings and faction quarrels, prejudicial to the peace and\r\nadvancement of the community. More than one-half of the present\r\nmembership of the tribe, from both the \"citizen\" and the \"Indian\"\r\nparties, into which it has been long divided, are reported by the agent\r\nas having decided to avail themselves of the enrolment provisions in the\r\nAct of Congress of February, 1871, before referred to, by which they\r\nwill finally receive their share of the tribal property, and become\r\ncitizens of the United States. Those who desire to retain their tribal\r\nrelation under the protection of the United States may, under the act\r\nadverted to, if they so elect by their council, procure a new location\r\nfor their future home. The school interests and religious care of this\r\npeople are under the superintendence of Mr. Jeremiah Slingerland, a\r\nStockbridge of much repute for his intelligence, and his success in the\r\ncause of the moral and educational improvement of his people.\r\n\r\n_The Oneidas_, numbering 1259, have a reservation of 60,800 acres near\r\nGreen Bay. They constitute the greater portion of the tribe of that name\r\n(derived from Lake Oneida, where the tribe then resided), formerly one\r\nof the \"Six Nations.\" ***\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA.\r\n\r\nThe Indians residing within the limits of Minnesota, as in the case of\r\nthose of the same name living in Wisconsin, heretofore noticed,\r\nconstitute a portion of the Ojibway or Chippewa nation, and comprise the\r\nfollowing bands: Mississippi, Pillager, Winnebagoshish, Pembina, Red\r\nLake, Boise Forte, Fond du Lac, and Grand Portage. The last three bands,\r\nbeing attached to the agency for the Chippewas of Lake Superior, have\r\nbeen treated of in connection with the Indians of Wisconsin. The five\r\nfirst-named bands number in the aggregate about 6455 souls, and occupy,\r\nor rather it is intended they shall ultimately occupy, ample\r\nreservations in the central and northern portion of the State, known as\r\nthe White Earth, Leech Lake, and Red Lake reservations, containing\r\naltogether about 4,672,000 acres—a portion of which is very valuable for\r\nits pine timber. *** _Mississippi Bands._—These Indians reside in\r\ndifferent localities. Most of them are on their reservation at White\r\nEarth; others are at Mille Lac, Gull Lake, and some at White Oak Point\r\nreservations. Upon the first-named reservation operations have been\r\nquite extensive in the erection of school-buildings, dwelling-houses,\r\nshops, and mills, and in breaking ground. At one time during the past\r\nsummer there was a prospect of an abundant yield from 300 acres sown in\r\ncereals; but, unfortunately, the grasshoppers swept away the entire\r\ncrop; and a second crop of buckwheat and turnips proved a failure. The\r\nIndians on this reservation are well-behaved, and inclined to be\r\nindustrious. Many of them are engaged in tilling the soil, while others\r\nare learning the mechanical arts; and they may, as a body, be said to be\r\nmaking considerable progress in the pursuits of civilized life. About\r\none-half of the Indians at Gull Lake have been removed to White Earth:\r\nthe remainder are opposed to removal, and will, in their present\r\nfeeling, rather forfeit their annuities than change their location. The\r\nMille Lac Chippewas, who continue to occupy the lands ceded by them in\r\n1863, with reservation of the right to live thereon during good\r\nbehavior, are indisposed to leave their old home for the new one\r\ndesigned for them on the White Earth Reservation. Only about twenty-five\r\nhave thus far been induced to remove. Their present reservation is rich\r\nin pine lands, the envy of lumber dealers; and there is a strong\r\npressure on all sides for their early removal. They should have help\r\nfrom the Government, whether they remain or remove; and this could be\r\nafforded to a sufficient extent by the sale for their benefit of the\r\ntimber upon the lands now occupied by them. Probably the Government\r\ncould provide for them in no better way.\r\n\r\n_The White Oak Point Chippewas_ were formerly known as Sandy Lake\r\nIndians. They were removed in 1867 from Sandy Lake and Rabbit Lake to\r\nWhite Oak Point, on the Mississippi, near the eastern part of the Leech\r\nLake Reservation. This location is unfavorable to their moral\r\nimprovement and material progress, from its proximity to the lumber\r\ncamps of the whites. Thus far the effort made to better their condition,\r\nby placing them on farming land, has proved a failure. The ground broken\r\nfor them has gone back into grass, and their log-houses are in ruins,\r\nthe former occupants betaking themselves to their wonted haunts. It\r\nwould be well if these Indians could be induced to remove to the White\r\nEarth Reservation.\r\n\r\nAt Red Lake the Indians have had a prosperous year: good crops of corn\r\nand potatoes have been raised, and a number of houses built. This band\r\nwould be in much better circumstances were they possessed of a greater\r\nquantity of arable lands. That to which they are at present limited\r\nallows but five acres, suitable for that use, to each family. It is\r\nproposed to sell their timber, and with the proceeds clear lands,\r\npurchase stock, and establish a manual-labor school.\r\n\r\n_The Pembina_ bands reside in Dakota Territory, but are here noticed in\r\nconnection with the Minnesota Indians, because of their being attached\r\nto the same agency. They have no reservation, having ceded their lands\r\nby treaty made in 1863, but claim title to Turtle Mountain in Dakota, on\r\nwhich some of them resided at the time of the treaty, and which lies\r\nwest of the line of the cession then made. They number, the full-bloods\r\nabout 350, and the half-breeds about 100. They lead a somewhat nomadic\r\nlife, depending upon the chase for a precarious subsistence, in\r\nconnection with an annuity from the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n_The Chippewas_ of Minnesota have had but few educational advantages;\r\nbut with the facilities now being afforded, and with the earnest\r\nendeavors that are now being put forth by their agent and the teachers\r\nemployed, especially at White Earth, it is expected that their interests\r\nin this regard will be greatly promoted. At White Earth school\r\noperations have been quite successful; so much so, that it will require\r\nadditional accommodations to meet the demands of the Indians for the\r\neducation of their children. The only other school in operation is that\r\nat Red Lake, under the auspices of the American Indian Mission\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nINDIANA.\r\n\r\nThere are now in Indiana about 345 Miamis, who did not go to Kansas when\r\nthe tribe moved to that section under the treaty of 1840. They are good\r\ncitizens, many being thrifty farmers, giving no trouble either to their\r\nwhite neighbors or to the Government. There is also a small band called\r\nthe Eel River band of Miamis, residing in this State and in Michigan.\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA, TENNESSEE, AND GEORGIA.\r\n\r\n_Cherokees._—There are residing in these States probably about 1700\r\nCherokees, who elected to remain, under the provisions respecting\r\nCherokees averse to removal, contained in the twelfth article of the\r\ntreaty with the Cherokees of 1835. Under the Act of July 29th, 1848, a\r\n_per capita_ transportation and subsistence fund of $53.33 was created\r\nand set apart for their benefit, in accordance with a census-roll made\r\nunder the provisions of said act; the interest on which fund, until such\r\ntime as they shall individually remove to the Indian country, is the\r\nonly money to which those named in said roll, who are living, or the\r\nheirs of those who have deceased, are entitled. This interest is too\r\nsmall to be of any benefit; and some action should be taken by Congress,\r\nwith a view of having all business matters between these Indians and the\r\nGovernment settled, by removing such of them west as now desire to go,\r\nand paying those who decline to remove the _per capita_ fund referred\r\nto. The Government has no agent residing with these Indians. In\r\naccordance with their earnestly expressed desire to be brought under the\r\nimmediate charge of the Government, as its wards, Congress, by law\r\napproved July 27th, 1868, directed that the Secretary of the Interior\r\nshould cause the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to take the same\r\nsupervisory charge of them as of other tribes of Indians; but this\r\npractically amounts to nothing, in the absence of means to carry out the\r\nintention of the law with any beneficial result to the Indians. The\r\ncondition of this people is represented to be deplorable. Before the\r\nlate Rebellion they were living in good circumstances, engaged, with all\r\nthe success which could be expected, in farming, and in various minor\r\nindustrial pursuits. Like all other inhabitants of this section, they\r\nsuffered much during the war, and are now, from this and other causes,\r\nmuch impoverished.\r\n\r\nFLORIDA.\r\n\r\n_Seminoles._—There are a few Seminoles, supposed to number about 300,\r\nstill residing in Florida—being those, or the descendants of those, who\r\nrefused to accompany the tribe when it removed to the West many years\r\nago. But little is known of their condition and temper.\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA, KANSAS, AND THE INDIAN TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Nebraska, Kansas, and the Indian Territory are\r\ndivided as follows: in Nebraska, about 6485; in Kansas, 1500; in the\r\nIndian Territory, 62,465.\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in Nebraska are the Santee Sioux, Winnebagoes Omahas,\r\nPawnees, Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri, Iowas, and the Otoes and\r\nMissourias. ***\r\n\r\n_Omahas._—The Omahas, a peaceable and inoffensive people, numbering 969,\r\na decrease since 1871 of fifteen, are native to the country now occupied\r\nby them, and occupy a reservation of 345,600 acres adjoining the\r\nWinnebagoes. They have lands allotted to them in severalty, and have\r\nmade considerable advancement in agriculture and civilization, though\r\nthey still follow the chase to some extent. Under the provisions of the\r\nAct of June 10th, 1872, steps are being taken to sell 50,000 acres of\r\nthe western part of their reservation. The proceeds of the sale of these\r\nlands will enable them to improve and stock their farms, build houses,\r\netc., and, with proper care and industry, to become in a few years\r\nentirely self-sustaining. A few cottages are to be found upon this\r\nreservation. There are at present three schools in operation on this\r\nreservation, with an attendance of 120 scholars.\r\n\r\n_Pawnees._—The Pawnees, a warlike people, number 2447, an increase for\r\nthe past year of eighty-three. They are located on a reservation of\r\n288,000 acres, in the central part of the State. They are native to the\r\ncountry now occupied by them, and have for years been loyal to the\r\nGovernment, having frequently furnished scouts for the army in\r\noperations against hostile tribes or marauding bands. Their location, so\r\nnear the frontier, and almost in constant contact with the Indians of\r\nthe plains, with whom they have been always more or less at war, has\r\ntended to retard their advancement in the arts of civilization. They\r\nare, however, gradually becoming more habituated to the customs of the\r\nwhites, are giving some attention to agriculture, and, with the\r\ndisappearance of the buffalo from their section of the country, will\r\ndoubtless settle down to farming and to the practice of mechanical arts\r\nin earnest. The Act of June 10th, 1872, heretofore referred to, provides\r\nalso for the sale of 50,000 acres belonging to the Pawnees, the same to\r\nbe taken from that part of their reservation lying south of Loup Fork.\r\nThese lands are now being surveyed; and it is believed that, with the\r\nproceeds of this sale, such improvements, in the way of building houses\r\nand opening and stocking farms, can be made for the Pawnees as will at\r\nan early day induce them to give their entire time and attention to\r\nindustrial pursuits. There are two schools in operation on the\r\nreservation—one a manual-labor boarding-school, the other a day-school,\r\nwith an attendance at both of 118 scholars. Provision was also made by\r\nCongress, at its last session, for the erection of two additional\r\nschool-houses for the use of this tribe.\r\n\r\n_Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri._—These Indians, formerly a portion of\r\nthe same tribe with the Indians now known as the Sacs and Foxes of the\r\nMississippi, emigrated many years ago from Iowa, and settled near the\r\ntribe of Iowas, hereafter to be mentioned. They number at the present\r\ntime but eighty-eight, having been steadily diminishing for years. They\r\nhave a reservation of about 16,000 acres, lying in the south-eastern\r\npart of Nebraska and the north-eastern part of Kansas, purchased for\r\nthem from the Iowas. Most of it is excellent land; but they have never,\r\nto any considerable extent, made use of it for tillage, being almost\r\nhopelessly disinclined to engage in labor of any kind, and depending\r\nprincipally for their subsistence, a very poor one, upon their annuity,\r\nwhich is secured to them by the treaty of October 31st, 1837, and\r\namounts to $7870. By Act of June 10th, 1872, provision was made for the\r\nsale of a portion or all of their reservation, the proceeds of such sale\r\nto be expended for their immediate use, or for their removal to the\r\nIndian Territory or elsewhere. They have consented to the sale of their\r\nentire reservation; and, so soon as funds shall have been received from\r\nthat source, steps will be taken to have them removed to the Indian\r\nTerritory south of Kansas.\r\n\r\n_Iowas._—These Indians, numbering at present 225, emigrated years ago\r\nfrom Iowa and North-western Missouri, and now have a reservation\r\nadjoining the Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri, containing about 16,000\r\nacres. They belong to a much better class of Indians than their\r\nneighbors the Sacs and Foxes, being temperate, frugal, industrious, and\r\ninterested in the education of their children. They were thoroughly\r\nloyal during the late rebellion, and furnished a number of soldiers to\r\nthe Union army. Many of them are good farmers; and as a tribe they are\r\ngenerally extending their agricultural operations, improving their\r\ndwellings, and adding to their comforts. A large majority of the tribe\r\nare anxious to have their reservation allotted in severalty; and,\r\ninasmuch as they are not inclined to remove to another locality, it\r\nwould seem desirable that their wishes in this respect should be\r\ncomplied with. One school is in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of sixty-eight scholars, besides an industrial home for\r\norphans, supported by the Indians themselves.\r\n\r\n_Otoes and Missourias._—These Indians, numbering 464, an increase of\r\nfourteen over last year, were removed from Iowa and Missouri to their\r\npresent beautiful and fertile reservation, comprising 160,000 acres, and\r\nsituated in the southern part of Nebraska. Until quite recently they\r\nhave evinced but little disposition to labor for a support, or in any\r\nway to better their miserable condition; yet cut off from their wonted\r\nsource of subsistence, the buffalo, by their fear of the wild tribes\r\nwhich have taken possession of their old hunting-grounds, they have\r\ngradually been more and more forced to work for a living. Within the\r\nlast three years many of them have opened farms and built themselves\r\nhouses. A school has also been established, having an attendance of\r\nninety-five scholars.\r\n\r\nKANSAS.\r\n\r\nThe Indians still remaining in Kansas are the Kickapoos, Pottawattomies\r\n(Prairie band), Chippewas and Munsees, Miamis, and the Kansas or Kaws.\r\n\r\n_Kickapoos._—The Kickapoos emigrated from Illinois, and are now located,\r\nto the number of 290, on a reservation of 19,200 acres, in the\r\nnorth-eastern part of the State. During the late war a party of about\r\none hundred, dissatisfied with the treaty made with the tribe in 1863,\r\nwent to Mexico, upon representations made to them by certain of their\r\nkinsmen living in that republic that they would be welcomed and\r\nprotected by the Mexican Government; but, finding themselves deceived,\r\nattempted to return to the United States. Only a few, however, succeeded\r\nin reaching the Kickapoo Agency. The Kickapoos now remaining in Mexico\r\nseparated from the tribe more than twenty years ago, and settled among\r\nthe southern Indians in the Indian Territory, on or near the Washita\r\nRiver, whence they went to Mexico where they still live, notwithstanding\r\nthe efforts of the Government of late to arrange with Mexico for their\r\nremoval to the Indian Territory, and location upon some suitable\r\nreservation. Their raids across the border have been a sore affliction\r\nto the people of Texas; and it is important that the first promising\r\noccasion should be taken to secure their return to the United States,\r\nand their establishment where they may be carefully watched, and\r\nrestrained from their depredatory habits, or summarily punished if they\r\npersist in them. The Kickapoos remaining in Kansas are peaceable and\r\nindustrious, continuing to make commendable progress in the cultivation\r\nof their farms, and showing much interest in the education of their\r\nchildren. Under the provisions of the treaty of June 28th, 1862, a few\r\nof these Indians have received lands in severalty, for which patents\r\nhave been issued, and are now citizens of the United States. Two schools\r\nare in operation among these Indians, with a daily average attendance of\r\nthirty-nine scholars.\r\n\r\n_Pottawattomies._—The Prairie band is all of this tribe remaining in\r\nKansas, the rest having become citizens and removed, or most of them, to\r\nthe Indian Territory. The tribe, excepting those in Wisconsin heretofore\r\nnoticed, formerly resided in Michigan and Indiana, and removed to Kansas\r\nunder the provisions of the treaty of 1846. The Prairie band numbers, as\r\nnearly as ascertained, about 400, and is located on a reserve of 77,357\r\nacres, fourteen miles north of Topeka. Notwithstanding many efforts to\r\neducate and civilize these Indians, most of them still cling tenaciously\r\nto the habits and customs of their fathers. Some, however, have recently\r\nturned their attention to agricultural pursuits, and are now raising\r\nstock, and most of the varieties of grain produced by their white\r\nneighbors. They are also showing more interest in education than\r\nformerly—one school being in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of eighty-four scholars.\r\n\r\n_Chippewas and Munsees._—Certain of the Chippewas of Saginaw, Swan\r\nCreek, and Black River, removed from Michigan under the treaty of 1836;\r\nand certain Munsees, or Christian Indians, from Wisconsin under the\r\ntreaty of 1839. These were united by the terms of the treaty concluded\r\nwith them July 16th, 1859. The united bands now number only fifty-six.\r\nThey own 4760 acres of land in Franklin County, about forty miles south\r\nof the town of Lawrence, holding the same in severalty, are considerably\r\nadvanced in the arts of life, and earn a decent living, principally by\r\nagriculture. They have one school in operation, with an attendance of\r\nsixteen scholars. These Indians at present have no treaty with the\r\nUnited States; nor do they receive any assistance from the Government.\r\n\r\n_Miamis._—The Miamis of Kansas formerly resided in Indiana, forming one\r\ntribe with the Miamis still remaining in that State, but removed in 1846\r\nto their present location, under the provisions of the treaty of 1840.\r\n\r\nOwing to the secession of a considerable number who have allied\r\nthemselves with the Peorias in the Indian Territory, and also to the\r\nravages of disease consequent on vicious indulgences, especially in the\r\nuse of intoxicating drinks, this band, which on its removal from Indiana\r\nembraced about five hundred, at present numbers but ninety-five. These\r\nhave a reservation of 10,240 acres in Linn and Miami Counties, in the\r\nsouth-eastern part of Kansas, the larger part of which is held in\r\nseveralty by them.\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs, in immediate charge, in his report\r\nfor this year says the Miamis remaining in Kansas are greatly\r\ndemoralized, their school has been abandoned, and their youth left\r\ndestitute of educational advantages. Considerable trouble has been for\r\nyears caused by white settlers locating aggressively on lands belonging\r\nto these Indians, no effort for their extrusion having been thus far\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n_Kansas or Kaws._—These Indians are native to the country they occupy.\r\nThey number at present 593; in 1860 they numbered 803. Although they\r\nhave a reservation of 80,640 acres of good land in the eastern part of\r\nthe State, they are poor and improvident, and have in late years\r\nsuffered much for want of the actual necessaries of life. They never\r\nwere much disposed to labor, depending upon the chase for a living, in\r\nconnection with the annuities due from the Government. They have been\r\ngrowing steadily poorer; and even now, in their straitened\r\ncircumstances, and under the pressure of want, they show but little\r\ninclination to engage in agricultural pursuits, all attempts to induce\r\nthem to work having measurably proved failures. Until quite recently\r\nthey could not even be prevailed upon to have their children educated.\r\nOne school is now in operation, with an attendance of about forty-five\r\nscholars. By the Act of May 8th, 1872, provision was made for the sale\r\nof all the lands owned by these Indians in Kansas, and for their removal\r\nto the Indian Territory. Provision was also made, by the Act of June\r\n5th, 1872, for their settlement within the limits of a tract of land\r\ntherein provided to be set apart for the Osages. Their lands in Kansas\r\nare now being appraised by commissioners appointed for the purpose,\r\npreparatory to their sale.\r\n\r\nINDIAN TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nThe Indians at present located in the Indian Territory—an extensive\r\ndistrict, bounded north by Kansas, east by Missouri and Arkansas, south\r\nby Texas, and west by the one hundredth meridian, designated by the\r\ncommissioners appointed under Act of Congress, July 20th, 1867, to\r\nestablish peace with certain hostile tribes, as one of two great\r\nTerritories (the other being, in the main, the present Territory of\r\nDakota, west of the Missouri) upon which might be concentrated the great\r\nbody of all the Indians east of the Rocky Mountains—are the Cherokees,\r\nChoctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks, Seminoles, Senecas, Shawnees, Quapaws,\r\nOttawas of Blanchard's Fork and Roche de Bœuf, Peorias, and confederated\r\nKaskaskias, Weas and Piankeshaws, Wyandottes, Pottawattomies, Sacs and\r\nFoxes of the Mississippi, Osages, Kiowas, Comanches, the Arapahoes and\r\nCheyennes of the south, the Wichitas and other affiliated bands, and a\r\nsmall band of Apaches long confederated with the Kiowas and Comanches.\r\n***\r\n\r\n_Choctaws and Chickasaws._—These tribes are for certain national\r\npurposes confederated. The Choctaws, numbering 16,000—an increase of\r\n1000 on the enumeration for 1871—have a reservation of 6,688,000 acres\r\nin the south-eastern part of the Territory; and the Chickasaws,\r\nnumbering 6000, own a tract containing 4,377,600 acres adjoining the\r\nChoctaws on the west. These tribes originally inhabited the section of\r\ncountry now embraced within the State of Mississippi, and were removed\r\nto their present location in accordance with the terms of the treaties\r\nconcluded with them, respectively, in 1820 and 1832. The remarks made\r\nrespecting the language, laws, educational advantages, industrial\r\npursuits, and advancement in the arts and customs of civilized life of\r\nthe Cherokees will apply in the main to the Choctaws and Chickasaws. The\r\nChoctaws have thirty-six schools in operation, with an attendance of 819\r\nscholars; the Chickasaws eleven, with 379 scholars. The Choctaws, under\r\nthe treaties of November 16th, 1805, October 18th, 1820, January 20th,\r\n1825, and June 22d, 1855, receive permanent annuities as follows: in\r\nmoney, $3000; for support of government, education, and other beneficial\r\npurposes, $25,512 89; for support of light-horsemen, $600; and for iron\r\nand steel, $320. They also have United States and State stocks, held in\r\ntrust for them by the Secretary of the Interior, to the amount of\r\n$506,427 20, divided as follows: on account of \"Choctaw general fund,\"\r\n$454,000; of \"Choctaw school fund,\" $52,427 20. The interest on these\r\nfunds, and the annuities, etc., are turned over to the treasurer of the\r\nnation, and expended under the direction of the National Council in the\r\nmanner and for the objects indicated in each case. The Chickasaws, under\r\nAct of February 25th, 1799, and treaty of April 28th, 1866, have a\r\npermanent annuity of $3000. They also have United States and State\r\nstocks, held in trust for them by the Secretary of the Interior, to the\r\namount of $1,185,947 03-2/3—$183,947 03-2/3 thereof being a \"national\r\nfund,\" and $2000 a fund for \"incompetents.\" The interest on these sums,\r\nand the item of $3000 first referred to, are paid over to the treasurer\r\nof the nation, and disbursed by him under the direction of the National\r\nCouncil, and for such objects as that body may determine.\r\n\r\n_Creeks._—The Creeks came originally from Alabama and Georgia. They\r\nnumbered at the latest date of enumeration 12,295, and have a\r\nreservation of 3,215,495 acres in the eastern and central part of the\r\nterritory. They are not generally so far advanced as the Cherokees,\r\nChoctaws, and Chickasaws, but are making rapid progress, and will\r\ndoubtless in a few years rank in all respects with their neighbors, the\r\nthree tribes just named. The Creeks, by the latest reports, have\r\nthirty-three schools in operation; one of which is under the management\r\nof the Methodist Mission Society, and another supported by the\r\nPresbyterians. The number of scholars in all the schools is 760. These\r\nIndians have, under treaties of August 7th, 1790, June 16th, 1802,\r\nJanuary 24th, 1826, August 7th, 1856, and June 14th, 1866, permanent\r\nannuities and interest on moneys uninvested as follows: in money,\r\n$68,258 40; for pay of blacksmiths and assistants, wagon-maker,\r\nwheelwright, iron and steel, $3250; for assistance in agricultural\r\noperations, $2000; and for education, $1000. The Secretary of the\r\nInterior holds in trust for certain members of the tribe, known as\r\n\"orphans,\" United States and State bonds to the amount of $76,999 66,\r\nthe interest on which sum is paid to those of said orphans who are\r\nalive, and to the representatives of those who have deceased.\r\n\r\n_Seminoles._—The Seminoles, numbering 2398, an increase of 190 over the\r\ncensus of 1871, have a reservation of 200,000 acres adjoining the Creeks\r\non the west. This tribe formerly inhabited the section of country now\r\nembraced in the State of Florida. Some of them removed to their present\r\nlocation under the provisions of the treaties of 1832 and 1833. The\r\nremainder of the tribe, instigated by the former chief, Osceola,\r\nrepudiated the treaties, refused to remove, and soon after commenced\r\ndepredating upon the whites. In 1835 these depredations resulted in war,\r\nwhich continued seven years, with immense cost of blood and treasure.\r\nThe Indians were at last rendered powerless to do further injury, and,\r\nafter efforts repeated through several years, were finally, with the\r\nexception of a few who fled to the everglades, removed to a reservation\r\nin the now Indian territory. In 1866 they ceded to the United States, by\r\ntreaty, the reservation then owned by them, and purchased the tract they\r\nat present occupy. They are not so far advanced in the arts of civilized\r\nlife as the Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Creeks, but are making\r\nrapid progress in that direction, and will, it is confidently believed,\r\nsoon rank with the tribes named. They cultivate 7600 acres; upon which\r\nthey raised during the past year 300,000 bushels of corn, and 6000\r\nbushels of potatoes. They live in log-houses, and own large stocks of\r\ncattle, horses, and hogs. The schools of the Seminoles number four, with\r\nan attendance of 169 scholars.\r\n\r\nThey receive, under treaties made with them August 7th, 1856, and March\r\n21st, 1866, annuities, etc., as follows: interest on $500,000, amounting\r\nto $25,000 annually, which is paid to them as annuity; interest on\r\n$50,000, amounting to $2500 annually, for support of schools; and $1000,\r\nthe interest on $20,000, for the support of their government.\r\n\r\n_Senecas and Shawnees._—The Senecas, numbering 214, and the Shawnees,\r\nnumbering ninety, at the present time, removed, some thirty-five or\r\nforty years ago, from Ohio to their present location in the\r\nnorth-eastern corner of the territory. They suffered severely during the\r\nRebellion, being obliged to leave their homes and fly to the north,\r\ntheir country being devastated by troops of both armies. Under the\r\nprovisions of the treaty of 1867, made with these and other tribes, the\r\nSenecas, who were then confederated with the Shawnees, dissolved their\r\nconnection with that tribe, sold to the United States their half of the\r\nreservation owned by them in common with the Shawnees, and connected\r\nthemselves with those Senecas who then owned a separate reservation. The\r\nShawnees now have a reservation of 24,960 acres, and the united Senecas\r\none of 44,000 acres. These tribes are engaged in agriculture to a\r\nconsiderable extent. They are peaceable and industrious. Many are\r\nthrifty farmers, and in comfortable circumstances. They have one school\r\nin operation, with an attendance of thirty-six scholars, which includes\r\nsome children of the Wyandottes, which tribe has no schools.\r\n\r\n_Quapaws._—These Indians number at the present time about 240. They are\r\nnative to the country, and occupy a reservation of 104,000 acres in the\r\nextreme north-east corner of the territory. They do not appear to have\r\nadvanced much within the past few years. In common with other tribes in\r\nthat section, they suffered greatly by the late war, and were rendered\r\nvery destitute. Their proximity to the border towns of Kansas, and the\r\nfacilities thereby afforded for obtaining whiskey, have tended to retard\r\ntheir progress; but there has recently been manifested a strong desire\r\nfor improvement; and with the funds derived from the sale of a part of\r\ntheir lands, and with the proposed opening of a school among them,\r\nbetter things are hoped for in the future.\r\n\r\n_Ottawas._—The Ottawas of Blanchard's Fork and Roche de Bœuf number, at\r\nthe present time, 150. They were originally located in Western Ohio and\r\nSouthern Michigan, and were removed, in accordance with the terms of the\r\ntreaty concluded with them in 1831, to a reservation within the present\r\nlimits of Kansas. Under the treaty of 1867 they obtained a reservation\r\nof 24,960 acres, lying immediately north of the western portion of the\r\nShawnee Reservation. They have paid considerable attention to education,\r\nare well advanced in civilization, and many of them are industrious and\r\nprosperous farmers. They have one school, attended by fifty-two\r\nscholars. The relation of this small band to the Government is somewhat\r\nanomalous, inasmuch as, agreeably to provisions contained in the\r\ntreaties of 1862 and 1867, they have become citizens of the United\r\nStates, and yet reside in the Indian country, possess a reservation\r\nthere, and maintain a purely tribal organization. They removed from\r\nFranklin Co., Kansas, in 1870.\r\n\r\n_Peorias_, _etc._—The Peorias, Kaskaskias, Weas, and Piankeshaws, who\r\nwere confederated in 1854, and at that time had a total population of\r\n259, now number 160. They occupy a reservation of 72,000 acres,\r\nadjoining the Quapaw Reservation on the south and west. Under treaties\r\nmade with these tribes in 1832, they removed to a tract within the\r\npresent limits of Kansas, where they remained until after the treaty of\r\n1867 was concluded with them, in which treaty provision was made whereby\r\nthey obtained their present reservation. These Indians are generally\r\nintelligent, well advanced in civilization, and, to judge from the\r\nstatistical reports of their agent, are very successful in their\r\nagricultural operations, raising crops ample for their own support. With\r\nthe Peorias are about forty Miamis from Kansas. They have one school in\r\noperation, with an attendance of twenty-nine scholars.\r\n\r\n_Wyandottes._—The Wyandottes number at the present time 222 souls. Ten\r\nyears ago there were 435. They occupy a reservation of 20,000 acres,\r\nlying between the Seneca and Shawnee reservations. This tribe was\r\nlocated for many years in North-western Ohio, whence they removed,\r\npursuant to the terms of the treaty made with them in 1842, to a\r\nreservation within the present limits of Kansas. By the treaty made with\r\nthem in 1867 their present reservation was set apart for those members\r\nof the tribe who desired to maintain their tribal organization, instead\r\nof becoming citizens, as provided in the treaty of 1855. They are poor,\r\nand, having no annuities and but little force of character, are making\r\nslight progress in industry or civilization. They have been lately\r\njoined by members of the tribe, who, under the treaty, accepted\r\ncitizenship. These, desiring to resume their relations with their\r\npeople, have been again adopted into the tribe.\r\n\r\n_Pottawattomies._—These Indians, who formerly resided in Michigan and\r\nIndiana, whence they removed to Kansas, before going down into the\r\nIndian Territory numbered about 1600. They have, under the provisions of\r\nthe treaty of 1861 made with the tribe, then residing in Kansas, become\r\ncitizens of the United States. By the terms of said treaty they received\r\nallotments of land, and their proportion of the tribal funds, with the\r\nexception of their share of certain non-paying State stocks, amounting\r\nto $67,000, held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior for the\r\nPottawattomies. Having disposed of their lands, they removed to the\r\nIndian Territory, where a reservation thirty miles square, adjoining the\r\nSeminole Reservation on the west, had been, by the treaty of 1867,\r\nprovided for such as should elect to maintain their tribal organization.\r\nIt having been decided, however, by the Department that, as they had all\r\nbecome citizens, there was consequently no part of the tribe remaining\r\nwhich could lay claim, under treaty stipulations, to the reservation in\r\nthe Indian Territory, legislation was had by Congress at its last\r\nsession—Act approved May 23d, 1872—by which these citizen Pottawattomies\r\nwere allowed allotments of land within the tract originally assigned for\r\ntheir use as a tribe, to the extent of 160 acres to each head of family,\r\nand to each other person twenty-one years of age, and of eighty acres to\r\neach minor. Most if not all of them are capable of taking care of\r\nthemselves; and many of them are well-educated, intelligent, and thrifty\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n_Absentee Shawnees._—These Indians, numbering 663, separated about\r\nthirty years ago from the main tribe, then located in Kansas, and\r\nsettled in the Indian Territory, principally within the limits of the\r\nthirty miles square tract heretofore referred to in the remarks relative\r\nto the Pottawattomies, where they engaged in farming, and have since\r\nsupported themselves without assistance from the Government.\r\n\r\n_Sacs and Foxes._—The Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi number at the\r\npresent time 463. In 1846 they numbered 2478. They have a reservation of\r\n483,340 acres, adjoining the Creeks on the west, and between the North\r\nFork of the Canadian and the Red Fork of the Arkansas Rivers. They\r\nformerly occupied large tracts of country in Wisconsin, Iowa, and\r\nMissouri, whence they removed, by virtue of treaty stipulations, to a\r\nreservation within the present limits of Kansas. By the terms of the\r\ntreaties of 1859 and 1868 all their lands in Kansas were ceded to the\r\nUnited States, and they were given in lieu thereof their present\r\nreservation. These Indians, once famous for their prowess in war, have\r\nnot, for some years, made any marked improvement upon their former\r\ncondition. Still they have accomplished a little, under highly adverse\r\ncircumstances and influences, in the way of opening small farms and in\r\nbuilding houses, and are beginning to show some regard for their women\r\nby relieving them of the burdens and labors heretofore required of them.\r\nThere is hope of their further improvement, although they are still but\r\none degree removed from the Blanket or Breech-clout Indians. They have\r\none school in operation, with an attendance of only about twelve\r\nscholars. Three hundred and seventeen members of these tribes, after\r\ntheir removal to Kansas, returned to Iowa, where they were permitted to\r\nremain, and are now, under the Act of March 2d, 1867, receiving their\r\nshare of the tribal funds. They have purchased 419 acres of land in Tama\r\nCounty, part of which they are cultivating. They are not much disposed\r\nto work, however, on lands of their own, preferring to labor for the\r\nwhite farmers in their vicinity, and are still much given to roving and\r\nhunting.\r\n\r\n_Osages._—The Osages, numbering 3956, are native to the general section\r\nof the country where they now live. Their reservation is bounded on the\r\nnorth by the south line of Kansas, east by the ninety-sixth degree of\r\nwest longitude, and south and west by the Arkansas River, and contains\r\napproximately 1,760,000 acres. They still follow the chase, the buffalo\r\nbeing their main dependence for food. Their wealth consists in horses\r\n(of which they own not less than 12,000) and in cattle.\r\n\r\n_Kiowas, Comanches, and Apaches._—These tribes, confederated under\r\npresent treaty stipulations, formerly ranged over an extensive country\r\nlying between the Rio Grande and the Red River. As nearly as can be\r\nascertained, they number as follows: Kiowas, 1930; Comanches, 3180; and\r\nApaches, 380. They are now located upon a reservation secured to them by\r\ntreaty made in 1867, comprising 3,549,440 acres in the south-western\r\npart of the Indian Territory, west of and adjoining the Chickasaw\r\ncountry. Wild and intractable, these Indians, even the best of them,\r\nhave given small signs of improvement in the arts of life; and,\r\nsubstantially, the whole dealing of the Government with them thus far\r\nhas been in the way of supplying their necessities for food and\r\nclothing, with a view to keeping them upon their reservation, and\r\npreventing their raiding into Texas, with the citizens of which State\r\nthey were for many years before their present establishment on terms of\r\nmutual hatred and injury. Some individuals and bands have remained quiet\r\nand peaceable upon their reservation, evincing a disposition to learn\r\nthe arts of life, to engage in agriculture, and to have their children\r\ninstructed in letters. To these every inducement is being held out to\r\ntake up land, and actively commence tilling it. Thus far they have under\r\ncultivation but 100 acres, which have produced the past year a good crop\r\nof corn and potatoes. The wealth of these tribes consists in horses and\r\nmules, of which they own to the number, as reported by their agent, of\r\n16,500, a great proportion of the animals notoriously having been stolen\r\nin Texas.\r\n\r\nHowever, it may be said, in a word, of these Indians, that their\r\ncivilization must follow their submission to the Government, and that\r\nthe first necessity in respect to them is a wholesome example, which\r\nshall inspire fear and command obedience. So long as four-fifths of\r\nthese tribes take turns at raiding into Texas, openly and boastfully\r\nbringing back scalps and spoils to their reservation, efforts to inspire\r\nvery high ideas of social and industrial life among the communities of\r\nwhich the raiders form so large a part will presumably result in\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n_Arapahoes and Cheyennes of the South._—These tribes are native to the\r\nsection of country now inhabited by them. The Arapahoes number at the\r\npresent time 1500, and the Cheyennes 2000. By the treaty of 1867, made\r\nwith these Indians, a large reservation was provided for them, bounded\r\non the north by Kansas, on the east by the Arkansas River, and on the\r\nsouth and west by the Red Fork of the Arkansas. They have, however,\r\npersisted in a refusal to locate on this reservation; and another tract,\r\ncontaining 4,011,500 acres, north of and adjoining the Kiowa and\r\nComanche Reservation, was set apart for them by Executive order of\r\nAugust 10th, 1869. By Act of May 29th, 1872, the Secretary of the\r\nInterior was authorized to negotiate with these Indians for the\r\nrelinquishment of their claim to the lands ceded to them by the said\r\ntreaty, and to give them in lieu thereof a \"sufficient and permanent\r\nlocation\" upon lands ceded to the United States by the Creeks and\r\nSeminoles in treaties made with them in 1866. Negotiations to the end\r\nproposed were duly entered into with these tribes unitedly; but, in the\r\ncourse of such negotiations, it has become the view of this office that\r\nthe tribes should no longer be associated in the occupation of a\r\nreservation. The Arapahoes are manifesting an increasing disinclination\r\nto follow farther the fortunes of the Cheyennes, and crave a location of\r\ntheir own. Inasmuch as the conduct of the Arapahoes is uniformly good,\r\nand their disposition to make industrial improvement very decided, it is\r\nthought that they should now be separated from the more turbulent\r\nCheyennes, and given a place where they may carry out their better\r\nintentions without interruption, and without the access of influences\r\ntending to draw their young men away to folly and mischief. With this\r\nview a contract, made subject to the action of Congress, was entered\r\ninto between the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the delegation of\r\nthe Arapahoe tribe which visited Washington during the present season\r\n(the delegation being fully empowered thereto by the tribe), by which\r\nthe Arapahoes relinquish all their interest in the reservation granted\r\nthem by the treaty of 1867, in consideration of the grant of a\r\nreservation between the North Fork of the Canadian River and the Red\r\nFork of the Arkansas River, and extending from a point ten miles east of\r\nthe ninety-eighth to near the ninety-ninth meridian of west longitude.\r\nShould this adjustment of the question, so far as the Arapahoes are\r\nconcerned, meet the approval of Congress, separate negotiations will be\r\nentered into with the Cheyennes, with a view to obtaining their\r\nrelinquishment of the reservation of 1867, and their location on some\r\nvacant tract within the same general section of the Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of the Arapahoes are already engaged in\r\nagriculture, though at a disadvantage; and, when the question of their\r\nreservation shall have been settled, it is confidently believed that\r\nsubstantially the whole body of this tribe will turn their attention to\r\nthe cultivation of the soil. Two schools are conducted for their benefit\r\nat the agency, having an attendance of thirty-five scholars. Of the\r\nCheyennes confederated with the Arapahoes, the reports are less\r\nfavorable as to progress made in industry, or disposition to improve\r\ntheir condition. Until 1867 both these tribes, in common with the Kiowas\r\nand Comanches, were engaged in hostilities against the white settlers in\r\nWestern Kansas; but since the treaty made with them in that year they\r\nhave, with the exception of one small band of the Cheyennes, remained\r\nfriendly, and have committed no depredations.\r\n\r\n_Wichitas_, _etc._—The Wichitas and other affiliated bands of Keechies,\r\nWacoes, Towoccaroes, Caddoes, Ionies, and Delawares, number 1250,\r\ndivided approximately as follows: Wichitas, 299; Keechies, 126; Wacoes,\r\n140; Towoccaroes, 127; Caddoes, 392; Ionies, 85; Delawares, 81. These\r\nIndians, fragments of once important tribes originally belonging in\r\nLouisiana, Texas, Kansas, and the Indian Territory, were all, excepting\r\nthe Wichitas and Delawares, removed by the Government from Texas, in\r\n1859, to the \"leased district,\" then belonging to the Choctaws and\r\nChickasaws, where they have since resided, at a point on the Washita\r\nRiver near old Fort Cobb. They have no treaty relations with the\r\nGovernment, nor have they any defined reservation. They have always, or\r\nat least for many years, been friendly to the whites, although in close\r\nand constant contact with the Kiowas and Comanches. A few of them,\r\nchiefly Caddoes and Delawares, are engaged in agriculture, and are\r\ndisposed to be industrious. Of the other Indians at this agency some\r\ncultivate small patches in corn and vegetables, the work being done\r\nmainly by women; but the most are content to live upon the Government.\r\nThe Caddoes rank among the best Indians of the continent, and set an\r\nexample to the other bands affiliated with them worthy of being more\r\ngenerally followed than it is. In physique, and in the virtues of\r\nchastity, temperance, and industry, they are the equals of many white\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nA permanent reservation should be set aside for the Indians of this\r\nagency; and, with proper assistance, they would doubtless in a few years\r\nbecome entirely self-sustaining. But one school is in operation, with an\r\nattendance of eighteen scholars. These Indians have no annuities; but an\r\nannual appropriation of $50,000 has for several years been made for\r\ntheir benefit. This money is expended for goods and agricultural\r\nimplements, and for assistance and instruction in farming, etc.\r\n\r\nDAKOTA, MONTANA, WYOMING, AND IDAHO.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho are divided\r\nas follows: in Dakota, about 28,000; Montana, 30,000; Wyoming, 2000; and\r\nIdaho, 5000. The present temporary location of the Red Cloud Agency has,\r\nhowever, drawn just within the limits of Wyoming a body of Indians\r\nvarying from 8000 to 9000, who are here, and usually reckoned as\r\nbelonging to Dakota.\r\n\r\nDAKOTA.\r\n\r\nThe Indians within the limits of Dakota Territory are the Sioux, the\r\nPoncas, and the Arickarees, Gros Ventres, and Mandans. ***\r\n\r\n_Arickarees, Gros Ventres, and Mandans._—These tribes number 2200, and\r\nhave a reservation set apart for their occupancy by Executive order of\r\nApril 12th, 1870, comprising 8,640,000 acres, situated in the\r\nnorth-western part of Dakota and the eastern part of Montana, extending\r\nto the Yellowstone and Powder rivers. They have no treaty with the\r\nGovernment, are now and have always been friendly to the whites, are\r\nexceptionally known to the officers of the army and to frontiersmen as\r\n\"good Indians,\" and are engaged to some extent in agriculture. Owing to\r\nthe shortness of the agricultural season, the rigor of the climate, and\r\nthe periodical ravages of grasshoppers, their efforts in this direction,\r\nthough made with a degree of patience and perseverance not usual in the\r\nIndian character, have met with frequent and distressing reverses; and\r\nit has from time to time been found necessary to furnish them with more\r\nor less subsistence to prevent starvation. They are traditional enemies\r\nof the Sioux; and the petty warfare maintained between them and the\r\nSioux of the Grand River and Cheyenne River Agencies—while, like most\r\nwarfare confined to Indians alone, it causes wonderfully little loss of\r\nlife—serves to disturb the condition of these agencies, and to retard\r\nthe progress of all the parties concerned. These Indians should be moved\r\nto the Indian Territory, south of Kansas, where the mildness of the\r\nclimate and the fertility of the soil would repay their labors, and\r\nwhere, it is thought, from their willingness to labor and their docility\r\nunder the control of the Government, they would in a few years become\r\nwholly self-supporting. The question of their removal has been submitted\r\nto them, and they seem inclined to favor the project, but have expressed\r\na desire to send a delegation of their chiefs to the Indian Territory,\r\nwith a view of satisfying themselves as to the desirableness of the\r\nlocation. Their wishes in this respect should be granted early next\r\nseason, that their removal and settlement may be effected during the\r\ncoming year. Notwithstanding their willingness to labor, they have shown\r\nbut little interest in education. Congress makes an appropriation of\r\n$75,000 annually for goods and provisions, for their instruction in\r\nagricultural and mechanical pursuits, for salaries of employés, and for\r\nthe education of their children, etc.\r\n\r\nMONTANA.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes residing within the limits of Montana are the\r\nBlackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans, the Gros Ventres of the Prairie, the\r\nAssinaboines, the Yanktonais, Santee and Teton (so-called) Sioux, a\r\nportion of the Northern Arapahoes and Cheyennes, the River Crows, the\r\nMountain Crows, the Flat-heads, Pend d'Oreilles and Kootenays, and a few\r\nShoshones, Bannocks, and Sheep-eaters, numbering in the aggregate about\r\n32,412. They are all, or nearly all, native to the regions now occupied\r\nby them respectively.\r\n\r\nThe following table will exhibit the population of each of these tribes,\r\nas nearly as the same can be ascertained:\r\n\r\n        Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans                      7500\r\n\r\n        Assinaboines                                        4790\r\n\r\n        Gros Ventres                                        1100\r\n\r\n        Santee, Yanktonais, Uncpapa, and\r\n        Cut-head Sioux, at Milk River Agency                2625\r\n\r\n        River Crows                                         1240\r\n\r\n        Mountain Crows                                      2700\r\n\r\n        Flat-heads                                           460\r\n\r\n        Pend d'Oreilles                                     1000\r\n\r\n        Kootenays                                            320\r\n\r\n        Shoshones, Bannocks, and Sheep-eaters                677\r\n\r\n        Roving Sioux, commonly called Teton\r\n        Sioux, including those gathered during\r\n        1872 at and near Fort Peck (largely\r\n        estimated)                                          8000\r\n\r\n                                                        --------\r\n\r\n        Estimated total                                   30,412\r\n\r\nThe number of Northern Cheyennes and Arapahoes roaming in Montana, who,\r\nit is believed, have co-operated with the Sioux under Sitting Bull, in\r\ntheir depredations, is not known: it is probably less than 1000.\r\n\r\nThe Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans (located at the Blackfeet Agency, on\r\nthe Teton River, about seventy-five miles from Fort Benton), the Gros\r\nVentres, Assinaboines, the River Crows, about 1000 of the Northern\r\nArapahoes and Cheyennes, and the Santee and Yankton Sioux (located at\r\nthe Milk River Agency, on the Milk River, about one hundred miles from\r\nits mouth), occupy jointly a reservation in the extreme northern part of\r\nthe Territory, set apart by treaties (not ratified) made in 1868 with\r\nmost of the tribes named, and containing about 17,408,000 acres. The\r\nBlackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans, particularly the last-named band, have\r\nbeen, until within about two years, engaged in depredating upon the\r\nwhite settlers. The Indians at the Milk River Agency, with the exception\r\nof the Sioux, are now, and have been for several years, quiet and\r\npeaceable. The Sioux at this agency, or most of them, were engaged in\r\nthe outbreak in Minnesota in 1862. On the suppression of hostilities\r\nthey fled to the northern part of Dakota, where they continued roaming\r\nuntil, in the fall of 1871, they went to their present location, with\r\nthe avowed intention of remaining there. Although they had been at war\r\nfor years with the Indians properly belonging to the Milk River Agency,\r\nyet, by judicious management on the part of the agent of the Government\r\nstationed there, and the influence of some of the most powerful chiefs,\r\nthe former feuds and difficulties were amicably arranged; and all\r\nparties have remained friendly to each other during the year past. The\r\nIndians at neither the Blackfeet nor the Milk River Agency show any\r\ndisposition to engage in farming; nor have they thus far manifested any\r\ndesire for the education of their children. They rely entirely upon the\r\nchase and upon the bounty of the Government for their support. They,\r\nhowever, quite scrupulously respect their obligation to preserve the\r\npeace; and no considerable difficulty has of late been experienced, or\r\nis anticipated, in keeping them in order. The Blackfeet, Bloods, and\r\nPiegans have an annual appropriation of $50,000 made for their benefit;\r\nthe Assinaboines, $30,000; the Gros Ventres of the Prairie, $35,000; the\r\nRiver Crows, $30,000. These funds are used in furnishing the respective\r\ntribes with goods and subsistence, and generally for such other objects\r\nas may be deemed necessary to keep the Indians quiet.\r\n\r\n_Mountain Crows._—These Indians have a reservation of 6,272,000 acres,\r\nlying in the southern part of the Territory, between the Yellowstone\r\nRiver and the north line of Wyoming Territory. They have always been\r\nfriendly to the whites, but are inveterate enemies of the Sioux, with\r\nwhom they have for years been at war. By the treaty of 1868—by the terms\r\nof which their present reservation was set apart for their\r\noccupancy—they are liberally supplied with goods, clothing, and\r\nsubsistence. But few of them are engaged in farming, the main body\r\nrelying upon their success in hunting, and upon the supplies furnished\r\nby the Government for their support. They have one school in operation,\r\nwith an attendance, however, of only nine scholars. By the treaty of May\r\n7th, 1868, provision is made by which they are to receive for a limited\r\nnumber of years the following annuities, etc., viz.: in clothing and\r\ngoods, $22,723 (twenty-six instalments due); in beneficial objects,\r\n$25,000 (six instalments due); in subsistence, $131,400 (one instalment\r\ndue). Blacksmiths, teachers, physician, carpenter, miller, engineer, and\r\nfarmer are also furnished for their benefit, at an expense to the\r\nGovernment of $11,600.\r\n\r\n_Flat-heads_, _etc._—The Flat-heads, Pend d'Oreilles, and Kootenays have\r\na reservation of 1,433,600 acres in the Jocko Valley, situated in the\r\nnorth-western part of the Territory, and secured to them by treaty of\r\n1855. This treaty also provided for a reservation in the Bitter-root\r\nValley, should the President of the United States deem it advisable to\r\nset apart another for their use. The Flat-heads have remained in the\r\nlast-named valley; but under the provisions of the Act of June 5th,\r\n1872, steps are being taken for their removal to the Jocko Reservation.\r\nMany of these Indians are engaged in agriculture; but, as they receive\r\nlittle assistance from the Government, their progress in this direction\r\nis slow. They have one school in operation, with an attendance of\r\ntwenty-seven scholars.\r\n\r\n_Shoshones_, _etc._—The Shoshones, Bannocks, and Sheep-eaters are at\r\npresent located about twenty miles above the mouth of the Lemhi Fork of\r\nthe Salmon River, near the western boundary of the Territory. They have\r\nshown considerable interest in agriculture, and many of them are quite\r\nsuccessful as farmers. They have no reservation set apart for them,\r\neither by treaty or by Executive order. They are so few in number that\r\nit would probably be better to remove them, with their consent, to the\r\nFort Hall Reservation in Idaho, where their brethren are located, than\r\nto provide them with a separate reservation. They have no schools in\r\noperation. An annual appropriation of $25,000 is made for these Indians,\r\nwhich sum is expended for their benefit in the purchase of clothing,\r\nsubsistence, agricultural implements, etc.\r\n\r\nWYOMING.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in this Territory, with the exception of the Sioux and\r\nNorthern Arapahoes and Cheyennes, mentioned under the heads of Dakota\r\nand Montana, respectively, are the eastern band of Shoshones, numbering\r\nabout 1000. The Shoshones are native to the country. Their reservation\r\nin the Wind River Valley, containing 2,688,000 acres, was set apart for\r\nthem by treaty of 1868.\r\n\r\nBut little advancement in civilization has been made by these Indians,\r\nowing to their indisposition to labor for a living, and to the incessant\r\nincursions into their country of the Sioux and the Northern Arapahoes\r\nand Cheyennes, with which tribes they have for many years been at war.\r\nThe losses sustained from these incursions, and the dread which they\r\ninspire, tend to make the Shoshones unsettled and unwilling to remain\r\ncontinuously on the reservation. They therefore spend most of the year\r\nin roaming and hunting, when they should be at work tilling the soil and\r\nimproving their lands. There is one school at the agency, having an\r\nattendance of ten scholars, in charge of an Episcopal missionary as\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nIDAHO.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes in Idaho are the Nez Percés, the Boisé and Bruneau\r\nShoshones, and Bannocks, the Cœur d'Alênes, and Spokanes, with several\r\nother small bands, numbering in the aggregate about 5800 souls. ***\r\n\r\n_Shoshones and Bannocks._—These Indians, numbering 1037—the former 516\r\nand the latter 521—occupy a reservation in the south-eastern part of the\r\nTerritory, near Fort Hall, formerly a military post. This reservation\r\nwas set apart by treaty of 1868 and Executive order of July 30th, 1869,\r\nand contains 1,568,000 acres. The Shoshones on this reservation have no\r\ntreaty with the Government. Both bands are generally quiet and\r\npeaceable, and cause but little trouble; are not disposed to engage in\r\nagriculture, and, with some assistance from the Government, depend upon\r\nhunting and fishing for subsistence. There is no school in operation on\r\nthe reservation.\r\n\r\n_Cœur d'Alênes_, _etc._—The Cœur d'Alênes, Spokanes, Kootenays, and Pend\r\nd'Oreilles, numbering about 2000, have no treaty with the United States,\r\nbut have a reservation of 256,000 acres set apart for their occupancy by\r\nExecutive order of June 14th, 1867, lying thirty or forty miles north of\r\nthe Nez Percés Reservation. They are peaceable, have no annuities,\r\nreceive no assistance from the Government, and are wholly\r\nself-sustaining. These Indians have never been collected upon a\r\nreservation, nor brought under the immediate supervision of an agent. So\r\nlong as their country shall remain unoccupied, and not in demand for\r\nsettlement by the whites, it will scarcely be desirable to make a change\r\nin their location; but the construction of the Northern Pacific\r\nRailroad, which will probably pass through or near their range, may make\r\nit expedient to concentrate them. At present they are largely under the\r\ninfluence of Catholic missionaries of the Cœur d'Alêne Mission.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO, NEW MEXICO, UTAH, ARIZONA, AND NEVADA.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada\r\nare divided as follows: in Colorado, about 3800; New Mexico, 19,000;\r\nUtah, 10,000; Arizona, 25,000; and Nevada, 13,000.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO.\r\n\r\nThe Indians residing in Colorado Territory are the Tabequache band of\r\nUtes, at the Los Pinos Agency, numbering 3000, and the Yampa, Grand\r\nRiver, and Uintah bands of the White River Agency, numbering 800. They\r\nare native to the section which they now inhabit, and have a reservation\r\nof 14,784,000 acres in the western part of the Territory, set apart for\r\ntheir occupancy by treaty made with them in 1868. The two agencies above\r\nnamed are established on this reservation, the White River Agency being\r\nin the northern part, on the river of that name, and the other in the\r\nsouth-eastern part. This reservation is much larger than is necessary\r\nfor the number of Indians located within its limits; and, as valuable\r\ngold and silver mines have been, or are alleged to have been, discovered\r\nin the southern part of it, the discoveries being followed by the\r\ninevitable prospecting parties and miners, Congress, by Act of April\r\n23d, 1872, authorized the Secretary of the Interior to enter into\r\nnegotiations with the Utes for the extinguishment of their right to the\r\nsouth part of it.\r\n\r\nA few of these Indians, who have declined to remove to and remain upon\r\nthe reservation, still roam in the eastern part of the Territory,\r\nfrequently visiting Denver and its vicinity, and causing some annoyance\r\nto the settlers by their presence, but committing no acts of violence or\r\nextensive depredations. The Indians of Colorado have thus far shown but\r\nlittle interest in the pursuits of civilized life or in the education of\r\ntheir children. A school is in operation at the Northern or White River\r\nAgency, with an attendance of forty scholars. Steps are also being taken\r\nto open one at the southern or Los Pinos Agency.\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing and roaming within the limits of New Mexico are the\r\nNavajoes, the Mescalero, Gila, and Jicarilla bands of Apaches; the\r\nMuache, Capote, and Weeminuche bands of Utes; and the Pueblos.\r\n\r\n_Navajoes._—The Navajoes now number 9114, an increase of 880 over last\r\nyear's enumeration. Superintendent Pope considers this increase to be\r\nmainly due to the return, during the year, of a number who had been held\r\nin captivity by the Mexicans. They have a reservation of 3,328,000 acres\r\nin the north-western part of New Mexico and north-eastern part of\r\nArizona, set apart for them by treaty of 1868. These Indians are natives\r\nof the section of the country where they are now located. Prior to 1864\r\nno less than seven treaties had been made with these tribes, which were\r\nsuccessively broken on their part, and that, with but one exception,\r\nbefore the Senate could take action on the question of their\r\nratification. In 1864 the Navajoes were made captives by the military,\r\nand taken to the Bosque Redondo Reservation, which had been set apart\r\nfor the Mescalero Apaches, where they were for a time held as prisoners\r\nof war, and then turned over to this Department. After the treaty of\r\n1868 had been concluded, they were removed to their present location,\r\nwhere they have, as a tribe, remained quiet and peaceable, many of them\r\nbeing engaged in agriculture and in raising sheep and goats. Of these\r\nthey have large flocks, numbering 130,000 head, which supply them not\r\nonly with subsistence, but also with material from which they\r\nmanufacture the celebrated, and for warmth and durability unequalled,\r\nNavajo blanket. They also have a stock of 10,000 horses. These Indians\r\nare industrious, attend faithfully to their crops, and even put in a\r\nsecond crop when the first, as frequently happens, is destroyed by\r\ndrought or frost. One school is in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of forty scholars.\r\n\r\n_Mescalero Apaches._—These Indians, numbering about 830, are at present\r\nlocated—not, however, upon a defined reservation secured to them—near\r\nFort Stanton, in the eastern part of the Territory, and range generally\r\nsouth of that point. Prior to 1864 they were located on the Bosque\r\nRedondo Reservation, where they were quiet and peaceable until the\r\nNavajoes were removed to that place. Being unable to live in harmony\r\nwith the newcomers, they fled from the reservation, and until quite\r\nrecently have been more or less hostile. They are now living at peace\r\nwith the whites, and conducting themselves measurably well. They have no\r\nschools, care nothing apparently about the education of their children,\r\nand are not to any noticeable extent engaged in farming, or in any\r\npursuit of an industrial character. These Indians have no treaty with\r\nthe United States; nor do they receive any annuities. They are, however,\r\nsubsisted in part by the Government, and are supplied with a limited\r\nquantity of clothing when necessary. In addition to the Mescaleros\r\nproper, Agent Curtis reports as being embraced in his agency other\r\nIndians, called by him Aguas Nuevos, 440; Lipans, 350 (probably from\r\nTexas); and Southern Apaches, 310, whose proper home is no doubt upon\r\nthe Tularosa Reservation. These Indians, the agent remarks, came from\r\nthe Comanche country to his agency at various dates during the past\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n_Gila (sometimes called Southern) Apaches._—This tribe is composed of\r\ntwo bands, the Mimbres and Mogollons, and number about 1200. They are\r\nwarlike, and have for years been generally unfriendly to the Government.\r\nThe citizens of Southern New Mexico, having long suffered from their\r\ndepredatory acts, loudly demanded that they be removed; and to comply\r\nwith the wish of the people, as well as to prevent serious difficulties\r\nand possibly war, it was a year or two since decided to provide the\r\nIndians with a reservation distant from their old home, and there\r\nestablish them. With a view to that end a considerable number of them\r\nwere collected early last year at Cañada Alamosa. Subsequently, by\r\nExecutive order dated November 9th, 1871, a reservation was set apart\r\nfor them with other roving bands of Apaches in the Tularosa Valley, to\r\nwhich place 450 of them are reported to have been removed during the\r\npresent year by United States troops. These Indians, although removed\r\nagainst their will, were at first pleased with the change, but, after a\r\nshort experience of their new home, became dissatisfied; and no small\r\nportion left the reservation to roam outside, disregarding the system of\r\npasses established. They bitterly object to the location as unhealthy,\r\nthe climate being severe and the water bad. There is undoubtedly much\r\ntruth in these complaints. They ask to be taken back to Cañada Alamosa,\r\ntheir own home, promising there to be peaceable and quiet. Of course\r\nnothing can be said of them favorable to the interests of education and\r\nlabor. Such of these Indians as remain on the reservation are being fed\r\nby the Government. They have no treaty with the United States; nor do\r\nthey receive annuities of any kind.\r\n\r\n_Jicarilla Apaches._—These Indians, numbering about 850, have for\r\nseveral years been located with the Muache Utes, about 650 in number, at\r\nthe Cimarron Agency, upon what is called \"Maxwell's Grant,\" in\r\nNorth-eastern New Mexico. They have no treaty relations with the\r\nGovernment; nor have they any reservation set apart for them. Efforts\r\nwere made some years ago to have them, with the Utes referred to, remove\r\nto the large Ute Reservation in Colorado, but without success. The\r\nCimarron Agency, however, has lately been discontinued; and these\r\nApaches will, if it can be effected without actual conflict, be removed\r\nto the Mescalero Agency at Fort Stanton. Four hundred Jicarilla Apaches\r\nare also reported as being at the Tierra Amarilla Agency.\r\n\r\n_Muache, Weeminuche, and Capote Utes._—These bands—the Muache band,\r\nnumbering about 650, heretofore at the Cimarron Agency, and the other\r\ntwo bands, numbering 870, at the Abiquiu Agency—are all parties to the\r\ntreaty made with the several bands of Utes in 1868. It has been desired\r\nto have these Indians remove to their proper reservation in Colorado;\r\nbut all efforts to this end have thus far proved futile. The\r\ndiscontinuance of the Cimarron Agency may have the effect to cause the\r\nMuaches to remove either to that reservation or to the Abiquiu Agency,\r\nnow located at Tierra Amarilla, in the north-western part of the\r\nterritory. These three bands have generally been peaceable, and friendly\r\nto the whites. Recently, however, some of them have shown a disposition\r\nto be troublesome; but no serious difficulty is apprehended. None of\r\nthem appear disposed to work for a subsistence, preferring to live by\r\nthe chase and on the bounty of the Government; nor do they show any\r\ninclination or desire to have their children educated, and taught the\r\nhabits and customs of civilized life. Declining to remove to and locate\r\npermanently upon the reservation set apart for the Utes in Colorado,\r\nthey receive no annuities, and participate in none of the benefits\r\nprovided in the treaties of 1863 and 1868 with the several bands of Ute\r\nIndians referred to under the head of \"Colorado.\"\r\n\r\n_Pueblos._—The Pueblos, so named because they live in villages, number\r\n7683. They have 439,664 acres of land confirmed to them by Act of\r\nCongress of December 22d, 1858, the same consisting of approved claims\r\nunder old Spanish grants. They have no treaty with the United States,\r\nand receive but little aid from the Government. During the past two\r\nyears efforts have been made, and are still being continued, to secure\r\nthe establishment of schools in all the villages of the Pueblos, for the\r\ninstruction of their children in the English language. Five such schools\r\nare now being conducted for their benefit.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Pueblos is an interesting one. They are the remains\r\nof a once powerful people, and in habits and modes of life are still\r\nclearly distinguished from all other aborigines of the continent. The\r\nSpanish invaders found them living generally in towns and cities. They\r\nare so described by Spanish historians as far back as 1540. They early\r\nrevolted, though without success, against Spanish rule; and in the\r\nstruggle many of their towns were burnt, and much loss of life and\r\nproperty occasioned. It would seem, however, that, in addition to the\r\nvillagers, there were others at that time living dispersed, whose\r\nreduction to Pueblos was determined upon and made the subject of a\r\ndecree by Charles V. of Spain, in 1546, in order chiefly, as declared,\r\nto their being instructed in the Catholic faith. Under the Spanish\r\nGovernment schools were established at the villages; the Christian\r\nreligion was introduced, and impressed upon the people, and the rights\r\nof property thoroughly protected. By all these means a high degree of\r\ncivilization was secured, which was maintained until after the\r\nestablishment of Mexican independence; when, from want of Government\r\ncare and support, decay followed, and the Pueblos measurably\r\ndeteriorated, down to the time when the authority of the United States\r\nwas extended over that country: still they are a remarkable people,\r\nnoted for their sobriety, industry, and docility. They have few wants,\r\nand are simple in their habits and moral in their lives. They are,\r\nindeed, scarcely to be considered Indians, in the sense traditionally\r\nattached to that word, and, but for their residence upon reservations\r\npatented to these bands in confirmation of ancient Spanish grants, and\r\ntheir continued tribal organization, might be regarded as a part of the\r\nordinary population of the country. There are now nineteen villages of\r\nthese Indians in New Mexico. Each village has a distinct and organized\r\ngovernment, with its governor and other officers, all of whom are\r\nelected annually by the people, except the _cacique_, a sort of\r\nhigh-priest, who holds his office during life. Though nominally\r\nCatholics in religion, it is thought that their real beliefs are those\r\nof their ancestors in the days of Montezuma.\r\n\r\nUTAH.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing wholly or in part within the limits of Utah are the\r\nNorth-western, Western, and Goship bands of Shoshones; the Weber, Yampa,\r\nElk Mountain, and Uintah bands of Utes; the Timpanagos, the San Pitches,\r\nthe Pah-Vents, the Piedes, and She-be-rechers—all, with the exception of\r\nthe Shoshones, speaking the Ute language, and being native to the\r\ncountry inhabited by them.\r\n\r\n_North-western, Western, and Goship Shoshones._—These three bands of\r\nShoshones, numbering together about 3000, have treaties made with the\r\nGovernment in 1863. No reservations were provided to be set apart for\r\nthem by the terms of said treaties, the only provision for their benefit\r\nbeing the agreement on the part of the United States to furnish them\r\nwith articles, to a limited extent and for a limited term, suitable to\r\ntheir wants as hunters or herdsmen. Having no reservations, but little\r\ncan be done for their advancement. They live in North-western Utah and\r\nNorth-eastern Nevada, and are generally inclined to be industrious, many\r\nof them gaining a livelihood by working for the white settlers, while\r\nothers cultivate small tracts of land on their own account.\r\n\r\nThe Weber Utes, numbering about 300, live in the vicinity of Salt Lake\r\nCity, and subsist by hunting, fishing, and begging. The Timpanagos,\r\nnumbering about 500, live south of Salt Lake City, and live by hunting\r\nand fishing. The San Pitches, numbering about 300, live, with the\r\nexception of some who have gone to the Uintah Valley Reservation, in the\r\ncountry south and east of the Timpanagos, and subsist by hunting and\r\nfishing. The Pah-Vents number about 1200, and occupy the Territory south\r\nof the Goships, cultivate small patches of ground, but live principally\r\nby hunting and fishing. The Yampa Utes, Piedes, Piutes, Elk Mountain\r\nUtes, and She-be-rechers live in the eastern and southern parts of the\r\nTerritory. They number, as nearly as can be estimated, 5200; do not\r\ncultivate the soil, but subsist by hunting and fishing, and at times by\r\ndepredating in a small way upon the white settlers. They are warlike and\r\nmigratory in their habits, carrying on a petty warfare pretty much all\r\nthe time with the southern Indians. These bands of Utes have no treaties\r\nwith the United States: they receive no annuities, and but very little\r\nassistance from the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Uintah Utes, numbering 800, are now residing upon a reservation of\r\n2,039,040 acres in Uintah Valley, in the north-eastern corner of the\r\nTerritory, set apart for the occupancy of the Indians in Utah by\r\nExecutive order of October 3d, 1861, and by Act of Congress of May 5th,\r\n1864. This reservation comprises some of the best farming land in Utah,\r\nand is of sufficient extent to maintain all the Indians in the\r\nTerritory. Some of the Indians located here show a disposition to engage\r\nin agriculture, though most of them still prefer the chase to labor. No\r\nsteps have yet been taken to open a school on the reservation. The\r\nUintah Utes have no treaty with the United States; but an appropriation\r\naveraging about $10,000 has been annually made for their civilization\r\nand improvement since 1863.\r\n\r\nARIZONA.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in the Territory of Arizona are the Pimas and\r\nMaricopas, Papagoes, Mohaves, Moquis, and Orivas Pueblos, Yumas,\r\nYavapais, Hualapais, and different bands of the Apaches. All are native\r\nto the districts occupied by them, respectively.\r\n\r\n_Pimas and Maricopas._—These, said to have been in former years\r\n\"Village\" or \"Pueblo\" Indians, number 4342, and occupy a reservation of\r\n64,000 acres, set apart for them under the Act of February 28th, 1859,\r\nand located in the central part of the Territory, on the Gila River.\r\nThey are, and always have been, peaceful and loyal to the Government;\r\nare considerably advanced, according to a rude form of civilization, and\r\nbeing industrious, and engaged quite successfully, whenever the\r\nconditions of soil and climate are favorable, in farming operations, are\r\nnearly self-sustaining. The relations of these bands with the\r\nneighboring whites are, however, very unfavorable to their interests;\r\nand the condition of affairs is fast growing worse. The difficulty\r\narises out of the fact of the use, and probably the improvident use, by\r\nthe whites above them, of the water of the Gila River, by which they are\r\ndeprived of all means of irrigating their lands. Much dissatisfaction is\r\nmanifested on this account; and the result is, so far, that many of the\r\nIndians have left the reservation, and gone to Salt River Valley, where\r\nthey are making a living by tilling the soil, not, however, without\r\ngetting into trouble at this point also with the settlers.\r\n\r\nThe Pimas and Maricopas are greatly interested in the education of their\r\nchildren. Two schools are in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of 105 scholars. These tribes have no treaty with the United\r\nStates, and receive but little assistance from the Government.\r\n\r\n_Papagoes._—These Indians, numbering about 5000, are of the same class,\r\nin some respects, as the Pueblos in New Mexico, living in villages,\r\ncultivating the soil, and raising stock for a support. They have no\r\nreservation set apart for their occupancy, but inhabit the south-eastern\r\npart of the Territory. Many of them have embraced Christianity; and they\r\nare generally well-behaved, quiet, and peaceable. They manifest a strong\r\ndesire to have their children educated; and steps to this end have been\r\ntaken by the Department. These Indians have no treaty relations with the\r\nUnited States, and receive no assistance from the Government. The\r\nexpediency of assigning to the Papagoes a reservation, and concentrating\r\nthem where they can be brought within the direct care and control of the\r\nGovernment, is under consideration by the Department. There seems to be\r\nno reason to doubt that, if so established, and once supplied with\r\nimplements and stock, they would become in a short time not only\r\nself-sustaining but prosperous.\r\n\r\n_Mohaves._—These Indians have a reservation of 75,000 acres, located on\r\nthe Colorado River, and set apart for them and other tribes in the\r\nvicinity of said river, under the Act of March 3d, 1865. The Mohaves\r\nnumber about 4000, of whom only 828 are on the reservation, the rest\r\neither roaming at large or being fed at other reservations in the\r\nTerritory. An irrigating canal has been built for them at great expense;\r\nbut farming operations have not as yet proved very successful. Over 1100\r\nacres, however, are being cultivated by the Indians. The crops consist\r\nof corn, melons, and pumpkins. These Indians show but little progress in\r\ncivilization. The parents objecting to the education of their children,\r\nno schools have been put in operation on the reservation, as they could\r\nbe conducted only on a compulsory system. The Mohaves have no treaty\r\nstipulations with the United States; but they are partly subsisted, and\r\nare largely assisted in their farming operations, from the general\r\nincidental fund of the Territory.\r\n\r\n_Yumas._—These Indians number probably 2000. They inhabit the country\r\nnear the mouth of the Colorado River, but belong to the reservation\r\noccupied by the Mohaves. They refuse, however, to remove to the\r\nreservation, and gain a scanty subsistence by planting, and by cutting\r\nwood for steamers plying on the river. Many of them remain about Arizona\r\nCity, performing menial services for the whites, and gratifying their\r\ninveterate passion for gambling. They have no treaty with the United\r\nStates, and receive but little assistance from the Government.\r\n\r\n_Hualapais._—These Indians, numbering about 1500, inhabit the country\r\nnear the Colorado River, north of the Mohaves, ranging a considerable\r\ndistance into the interior. They have been, and still are, more or less\r\nhostile. Those who are quiet and peaceable are, with members of other\r\nbands of Indians, being fed by the Government at Camps McDowell, Beal's\r\nSpring, and Date Creek.\r\n\r\n_Yavapais and Apaches._—These Indians are estimated to number from 8000\r\nto 12,000, the lower estimate being the more reasonable. Their\r\nranging-grounds are in the central, northern, and eastern parts of the\r\nTerritory. Most of them have long been hostile to the Government,\r\ncommitting numerous robberies and murders. Earnest efforts have been\r\nmade during the past year to settle them on reservations, three of\r\nwhich, viz., Camp Apache, Camp Grant, and Camp Verde, were set apart for\r\ntheir occupancy by Executive order dated November 9th, 1871. These\r\nefforts, however, have not resulted very successfully; the Indians\r\noccasionally coming upon the reservations in large numbers, but leaving\r\nwithout permission, and, indeed, defiantly, whenever so disposed,\r\noftentimes renewing their depredations before their supplies of\r\ngovernment rations are exhausted. Many of the bands of this tribe (if it\r\ncan be called a tribe; habits, physical structure, and language all\r\npointing to a great diversity in origin among the several bands) are\r\nseemingly incorrigible, and will hardly be brought to cease their\r\ndepredations and massacres except by the application of military force.\r\n\r\nNEVADA.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Nevada are Pah-Utes, Piutes, Washoes, Shoshones,\r\nand Bannocks, and are native to the districts inhabited by them\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n_Pah-Utes._—These Indians, numbering about 6000, inhabit the western\r\npart of the State. Two reservations have been set apart for them—one\r\nknown as the Walker River, the other as the Pyramid Lake Reservation,\r\ncontaining each 320,000 acres. These Indians are quiet, and friendly to\r\nthe whites—are very poor, and live chiefly upon fish, game, seeds, and\r\nnuts, with such assistance as the Government from time to time renders\r\nthem. They show considerable disposition to labor; and those on the\r\nreservations, especially the Walker River Reservation, are cultivating\r\nsmall patches of ground. The Pyramid Lake Reservation affords, in\r\naddition, excellent fishing, and the surrounding settlements a ready\r\nmarket for the catch over and above what the Indians require for their\r\nown consumption. No schools have been established for these Indians.\r\nThey have no treaty relations with the Government, and receive no\r\nannuities.\r\n\r\n_Piutes._—The Piutes, numbering probably 2500, inhabit the south-eastern\r\npart of the State. They have no reservation set apart for them; nor have\r\nthey any treaty with the United States. They roam about at will, are\r\nvery destitute, and obtain a living principally by pilfering from the\r\nwhites, although a few of them are engaged in a small way in farming.\r\nBut very little can be done for these Indians by the Government in their\r\npresent unsettled condition. They should be brought upon one of the\r\nreservations set apart for the Indians in Nevada, or upon the Uintah\r\nReservation in Utah, where they could receive suitable care and proper\r\ninstruction in the arts of civilized life.\r\n\r\n_Washoes._—These Indians, numbering about 500, are a poor, miserable,\r\nand debauched people, and spend most of their time among the white\r\nsettlements, where they gain some supplies of food and clothing by\r\nmenial services. They have no reservation and no treaty, are not in\r\ncharge of any agent of the Government; and vice and disease are rapidly\r\ncarrying them away.\r\n\r\n_Shoshones._—The Shoshones are a portion of the North-western, Western,\r\nand Goship bands, referred to under the head of \"Utah.\" Those roaming or\r\nresiding in the eastern part of Nevada number about 2000. The remarks\r\nmade respecting their brethren in Utah will equally apply to them.\r\n\r\n_Bannocks._—The Bannocks, roaming in the north-eastern part of the\r\nState, number, probably, 1500, and are doubtless a portion of the people\r\nof that name ranging in Eastern Oregon and Southern Idaho. They have no\r\ntreaty with the Government, nor any reservation set apart for them, and\r\nare not in charge of any United States agent. They should, if possible,\r\nbe located upon the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho, where some steps\r\ncould be taken to advance them in civilization.\r\n\r\nTHE PACIFIC SLOPE.\r\n\r\nThe Indians on the Pacific slope are divided as follows: in Washington\r\nTerritory, about 14,000; in Oregon, 12,000; in California, 22,000.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Washington Territory are the Nisqually, Puyallup,\r\nand other confederate tribes; the D'Wamish and other allied bands; the\r\nMakahs, the S'Klallams, the Qui-nai-elts and Qui-leh-utes, the Yakamas,\r\nthe Chehalis, and other allied tribes, and the Colville, Spokanes, Cœur\r\nd'Alênes, Okanagans, and others.\r\n\r\n_Nisqually, Puyallup, and others._—These Indians, numbering about 1200,\r\nhave three reservations, containing, as per treaty of 1854, 26,776\r\nacres, situated on the Nisqually and Puyallup Rivers, and on an island\r\nin Puget Sound. Some of these Indians are engaged in farming, and raise\r\nconsiderable wheat, also potatoes and other vegetables. Many are\r\nemployed by the farmers in their vicinity; while others still are idle\r\nand shiftless, spending their time wandering from place to place. One\r\nschool is in operation on the Puyallup Reservation, with an attendance\r\nof eleven scholars.\r\n\r\n_D'Wamish and others._—The D'Wamish and other allied tribes number 3600,\r\nand have five reservations, containing in all 41,716 acres, set apart by\r\ntreaty made with them in 1855, and located at as many points on Puget\r\nSound. Many of these Indians, particularly those residing on the Lummi\r\nReservation, are industrious farmers, raising all the produce necessary\r\nfor their support, and owning a large number of cattle, horses, hogs,\r\netc.; while others are either employed by the neighboring white farmers\r\nor engaged in lumbering on their own account. They are generally\r\nChristianized, most of them members of the Catholic Church. One school,\r\nwith fifty-seven scholars, is in operation on the Tulalip Reservation,\r\nwhere all the Government buildings are located. This school has had a\r\nremarkable degree of success, as reported by the agent and by\r\ndisinterested visitors.\r\n\r\n_Makahs._—These Indians number 604, and have a reservation of 12,800\r\nacres, set apart by treaty made with them in 1855, and located at the\r\nextreme north-west corner of the Territory. They are a bold, hardy race,\r\nnot inclined to till the soil for a support, but depending principally\r\nupon fishing and the taking of fur-seal for their livelihood. One school\r\nis in operation among them, with an attendance of sixteen scholars.\r\n\r\n_S'Klallams._—These Indians, numbering 919, have a reservation of 4000\r\nacres, set apart by treaty made with them in 1855, and located on what\r\nis known as \"Hood's Canal.\" Some of them are engaged, in a small way, in\r\nfarming; and others are employed in logging for the neighboring\r\nsaw-mills. Their condition generally is such that their advancement in\r\ncivilization must necessarily be slow. A school has been established on\r\nthe reservation, and is attended by twenty-two scholars.\r\n\r\n_Qui-nai-elts, Qui-leh-utes, Hohs, and Quits._—These Indians number 520,\r\nand have a reservation of 25,600 acres, in the extreme eastern part of\r\nthe Territory, and almost wholly isolated from white settlements, set\r\napart under a treaty made with them July 1st, 1855. But one of the four\r\ntribes mentioned, the Qui-nai-elts, live upon the reservation: the\r\nothers reside at different points along the coast, northward from the\r\nreservation. These declare that they never agreed to sell their country,\r\nand that they never knowingly signed any treaty disposing of their right\r\nto it. The bottom land on the reservation is heavily timbered, and a\r\ngreat deal of labor is required to clear it; but, when cleared, it\r\nproduces good crops. Many of the Indians, though in the main fish-eaters\r\n(the Qui-nai-elt River furnishing them with salmon in great abundance),\r\nare cultivating small patches, and raise sufficient vegetables for their\r\nown use. One school is in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of fifteen scholars.\r\n\r\n_Yakamas._—The Yakamas number 3000, and have a reservation in the\r\nsouthern part of the Territory, containing 783,360 acres, set apart for\r\nthem by treaty of June 9th, 1855. These Indians belong to numerous\r\nbands, confederated under the title of Yakamas. Many of them, under the\r\nable management of their present agent, have become noticeably advanced\r\nin civilization, and are good farmers or skilled mechanics. The\r\nmanual-labor school at the Yakama Agency has been a complete success,\r\nand of incalculable benefit in imparting to the children a practical\r\nknowledge of farming and of the different mechanical arts. Their\r\nprincipal wealth is in horses, of which they own 12,000. The fact that\r\nthe reservation for these Indians is located east of the Cascade\r\nMountains, away from all contact with the whites, has doubtless tended,\r\nin a great measure, to make this what it is—the model agency on the\r\nPacific slope: though to this result the energy and devotion of Agent\r\nWilbur have greatly contributed. Churches have been built on the\r\nreservation, which are well attended, the services being conducted by\r\nnative preachers. There are at present two schools, with an attendance\r\nof forty-four scholars.\r\n\r\n_Chehalis and others, Remnants of Tribes, and Parties to no Treaty with\r\nthe Government._—These Indians number about 600, and have a reservation\r\nof 4322 acres in the eastern part of the territory, set apart for them\r\nby Executive order of July 8th, 1864. A considerable portion of the land\r\nin this reservation is excellent for agricultural purposes; and quite\r\nextensive crops are being raised by the Indians of the Chehalis tribe.\r\nNone of the other tribes for whom the reservation was intended reside\r\nupon it, declining to do so for the reason that they do not recognize it\r\nas their own, and fear to prejudice their claims to other lands by so\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nAll these Indians have horses and cattle in abundance. They are\r\nindustrious; and, being good field-hands, those of them who do not farm\r\non their own account find ready employment from the surrounding farmers,\r\ntheir services always commanding the highest wages. Having no treaty\r\nrelations with the Government, no direct appropriations are made for\r\ntheir benefit. They, however, receive some assistance from the general\r\nincidental fund of the Territory. The Indians herein referred to as not\r\nliving upon the reservation are of the Cowlitz, Chinook, Shoalwater Bay,\r\nand Humboldt tribes. They profess to desire a home at the mouth of the\r\nHumboldt and Coinoose rivers, where they originated.\r\n\r\n_Colville and other Tribes._—These Indians, numbering 3349, occupy the\r\nnorth-eastern portion of the territory. They have no treaty relations\r\nwith the Government, and, until the present year, have had no\r\nreservation set apart for them. They are now, however, to be\r\nestablished, under an order of the President of July 2d, 1872, in the\r\ngeneral section of the Territory where they now are, upon a tract which\r\nis bounded on the south and east by the Columbia River, on the west by\r\nthe Okinakane River, and on the north by British Columbia. The tribes\r\nfor whom this reservation is designed are known as Colvilles,\r\nOkinakanes, San Poels, Lake Spokanes, Cœur d'Alênes, Calispells, and\r\nMethows. Some of these Indians, however, have settled upon valuable\r\ntracts of land, and have made extensive improvements, while others, to a\r\nconsiderable number, have begun farming in a small way at various points\r\nwithin the district from which it is proposed to remove their respective\r\ntribes. It is doubtful whether these individuals will voluntarily remove\r\nto the reservation referred to, which is some distance west of their\r\npresent location. It is proposed, therefore, to allow such as are\r\nengaged in farming to remain where they are, if they so desire. Owing to\r\nthe influx of whites into the country thus claimed or occupied by these\r\nIndians, many of them have been crowded out; and some of them have had\r\ntheir own unquestionable improvements forcibly wrested from them. This\r\nfor a time during the past summer caused considerable trouble, and\r\nserious difficulties were apprehended; but thus far peace has been\r\npreserved by a liberal distribution among them of agricultural\r\nimplements, seeds, blankets, etc. No funds are appropriated specially\r\nfor these Indians, such supplies and presents as are given them being\r\nfurnished from the general incidental fund of the Territory.\r\n\r\nOREGON.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Oregon are the Umatillas, Cayuses, Walla-Wallas,\r\nWascoes, Molels, Chasta Scotans, Coosas, Alseas, Klamath, Modocs, and\r\nWal-pah-pee Snakes, besides numerous other small bands. They are all\r\nnative to the country. On account of the great number of small tribes\r\nand bands in this State—the number of tribes and bands parties to the\r\nsame treaty being in some cases as high as ten or fifteen—these Indians\r\nwill be treated of, and the remarks concerning them will be made, under\r\nthe heads of the agencies at which they are respectively located.\r\n\r\n_Umatilla Agency._—The tribes located at this agency are the Umatillas,\r\nCayuses, and a portion of the Walla-Wallas, and number 837. They have a\r\nreservation of 512,000 acres, situated in the north-eastern part of the\r\nState, set apart for them by treaty of June 9th, 1855. This reservation\r\nis very fertile, and, as usual in such cases, has attracted the cupidity\r\nof the whites. A proposition was made last year, under the authority of\r\nCongress, to have the Indians take land in severalty, or sell and remove\r\nto some other reservation. The Indians, however, in the exercise of\r\ntheir treaty rights, refused to accede to this proposition. These\r\nIndians are successfully engaged in agricultural operations, are nearly\r\nself-supporting, and may be considered, comparatively speaking, wealthy.\r\nIt is gratifying to state that the introduction of whiskey by whites\r\nupon this reservation, and its sale to the Indians, has, during the last\r\nyear, received a decided check through the vigilance of Agent Cornoyer\r\nin causing the arrest and trial of four citizens for a violation of the\r\nlaw in this respect. All the parties charged were convicted, and are now\r\nin prison. This is especially worthy of note, from the fact that it is\r\nalways exceedingly difficult to obtain convictions for such dealing with\r\nIndians in any section of the country. There is one school in operation\r\non the reservation, with an attendance of twenty-seven scholars.\r\n\r\n_Warm Spring Agency._—The Indians at this agency, known as the\r\n\"Confederated Tribes and Bands of Indians in Middle Oregon,\" comprise\r\nseven bands of the Walla-Walla and Wasco tribes, numbering 626. They\r\nhave a reservation of 1,024,000 acres, located in the central part of\r\nthe State, set apart for them by the treaty of June 25th, 1855. Though\r\nthere is but little really good land in this reservation, many of the\r\nIndians, by reason of their industry, have succeeded measurably in their\r\nfarming operations, and may be considered as self-sustaining. In morals\r\nthey have greatly improved; so that polygamy, the buying and selling of\r\nwives, gambling, and drunkenness have ceased to be common among them, as\r\nin the past. There are some, however, who are disposed to wander off the\r\nreservation and lead a vagabond life. But little advancement has been\r\nmade in education among these Indians. One school is in operation at the\r\nagency, with an attendance of fifty-one scholars.\r\n\r\n_Grand Ronde Agency._—The Indians at this agency comprise the Molalla,\r\nClackama, Calapooia, Molel, Umpqua, Rogue River, and other bands,\r\nseventeen in all, with a total population of 870. The reservation upon\r\nwhich these bands are located is in the northwestern part of the State.\r\nIt contains 69,120 acres, and was set apart for their occupation by\r\ntreaty of January 22d, 1855, with the Molallas, Clackamas, etc., and by\r\nExecutive order of June 30th, 1857. Some portions of this reservation\r\nare well adapted to grain-raising, though much of it is rough and\r\nheavily timbered. An allotment of land in severalty has been directed to\r\nbe made, much to the gratification and encouragement of the tribes.\r\nThese Indians are inclined to industry, and show commendable zeal in\r\ncultivating their farms, growing crops which compare favorably with\r\nthose of their white neighbors. Their customs and habits of life also\r\nexhibit a marked improvement. One school is in operation, with an\r\nattendance of fifty scholars.\r\n\r\n_Siletz Agency._—The Indians at this agency are the Chasta Scotans and\r\nfragments of fourteen other bands, called, generally, coast-tribes,\r\nnumbering altogether about 2500. These Indians, including those at the\r\nAlsea Sub-agency, have a reservation of 1,100,800 acres set apart for\r\nthem by treaty of August 11th, 1855; which treaty, however, has never\r\nbeen ratified, although the reservation is occupied by the Indians. They\r\nwere for a long time much averse to labor for a support; but recently\r\nthey have shown more disposition to follow agriculture, although\r\ntraditionally accustomed to rely chiefly upon fish for food. Many\r\nalready have their farms well fenced and stocked, with good, comfortable\r\ndwellings and out-houses erected thereon. There is no reason why they\r\nshould not, in time, become a thoroughly prosperous people. The failure\r\nto make allotments of land in severalty, for which surveys were\r\ncommenced in 1871, has been a source of much uneasiness to the Indians,\r\nand has tended to weaken their confidence in the good intentions of the\r\nGovernment. One school is in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of twenty scholars. None of the tribes or bands at this\r\nagency have any treaty relations with the United States, unless it may\r\nbe a few members of the Rogue River band, referred to under the head of\r\nthe Grand Ronde Agency.\r\n\r\n_Alsea Sub-agency._—The Indians at this sub-agency are the Alseas,\r\nCoosas, Sinselans, and a band of Umpquas, numbering in all 300, located\r\nwithin the limits of the reservation referred to under the head of the\r\nSiletz Agency. The remarks made about the Indians at the Siletz Agency\r\nwill generally apply to the Indians of this sub-agency. The Coosas,\r\nSinselans, and Umpquas are making considerable advancement in\r\nagriculture, and, had they advantages of instruction, would rapidly\r\nacquire a proficiency in the simpler mechanical branches of industry.\r\nThe Alseas are not so tractable, and exhibit but little desire for\r\nimprovement. All the assistance they receive from the Government is\r\nsupplied out of the limited amount appropriated for the general\r\nincidental expenses of the service in Oregon.\r\n\r\n_Klamath Agency._—The Indians belonging to this agency are the Klamaths\r\nand Modocs, and the Yahooskin and Wal-pah-pee bands of Snakes, numbering\r\naltogether about 4000, of whom only 1018 are reported at the agency.\r\nThey have a reservation containing 768,000 acres, set apart for them by\r\nthe treaty of October 14th, 1864, and by Executive order of March 14th,\r\n1871, situated in the extreme southern portion of the State. This\r\nreservation is not well adapted to agriculture. The climate is cold and\r\nuncertain; and the crops are consequently liable to be destroyed by\r\nfrosts. It is, however, a good grazing country. Although this\r\nreservation is, comparatively speaking, a new one, the Indians located\r\nupon it are making commendable progress, both in farming operations and\r\nin lumbering. A part of the Modocs, who belong by treaty to this agency,\r\nand who were at one time located upon the reservation, have, on account\r\nof their troubles with the Klamaths—due principally to the overbearing\r\ndisposition of the latter—left the agency, and refuse to return to it.\r\nThey desire to locate upon a small reservation by themselves. Under the\r\ncircumstances they should be permitted to do this, or else be allowed to\r\nselect a tract on the Malheur Reservation. There is no school at present\r\nin operation for these Indians.\r\n\r\n_Malheur Reservation._—This reservation, set apart by Executive order of\r\nSeptember 12th, 1872, is situated in the south-eastern part of the\r\nState. Upon this it is the intention of the Department eventually to\r\nlocate all the roving and straggling bands, in Eastern and South-eastern\r\nOregon, which can be induced to settle there. As no funds are at the\r\ndisposal of the Department with which to make the necessary\r\nimprovements, and to provide temporary subsistence for Indians removed,\r\nthe work has not yet been fairly commenced. The Indians who should be\r\ncollected upon this reservation are now a constant source of annoyance\r\nto the white settlers. They hang about the settlements and military\r\nposts, begging and stealing; and, unless some prompt measures be taken\r\nto bring them under the care and control of an agent of the Government,\r\nserious trouble may result at any time. Congress should make the\r\nnecessary appropriation during the coming session to maintain an agent\r\nfor these Indians, to erect the agency buildings, and to provide\r\nsubsistence for such as may be collected and may remain upon the\r\nreservation.\r\n\r\n_Indians not upon Reservations._—There are a number of Indians, probably\r\nnot less than 3000, \"renegades,\" and others of roving habits, who have\r\nno treaty relations with the Government, and are not in charge of any\r\nagent. The tribal names of some of these are the Clatsops, Nestucals,\r\nTillamooks, Nehalims, Snakes, and Nez Percés. The \"renegades,\" such in\r\nfact, and so called, roam on the Columbia River, and are of considerable\r\nannoyance to the agents at Warm Springs and Umatilla: others, the\r\nSnakes, 200 in number, are upon the edge of the Grand Ronde Reservation.\r\nThese live by hunting and fishing, and profess to desire to have lands\r\nallotted to them, and a school provided for their children. The Nez\r\nPercés, belonging in Idaho, to the estimated number of 200, are found in\r\nWallowa Valley, in the eastern part of the State. They claim that they\r\nwere not parties to the treaty with the Nez Percé tribe years ago; that\r\nthe valley in which they live has always belonged to them; and they\r\nstrenuously oppose its settlement by the whites.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nThe tribes in California are the Ukie, Pitt River, Wylackie, Concon,\r\nRedwood, Humboldt, Hoonsolton, Miscott, Siah, Tule, Tejon, Coahuila,\r\nKing's River, and various other bands and tribes, including the \"Mission\r\nIndians,\" all being native to the country.\r\n\r\n_Round Valley Agency._—The Indians belonging to this agency are the\r\nUkies, Concons, Pitt Rivers, Wylackies, and Redwoods, numbering in all\r\n1700. The number has been increased during the past year by bringing in\r\n1040 Indians collected in Little Lake and other valleys. A reservation\r\ncontaining 31,683 acres has been set apart, per Act of April 8th, 1864,\r\nand Executive order of March 30th, 1870, in the western and northern\r\npart of the State, for these Indians, and for such others as may be\r\ninduced to locate thereon. The lands in the reservation are very\r\nfertile; and the climate admits of a widely varied growth of crops. More\r\nproduce being raised than is necessary for the subsistence of the\r\nIndians, the proceeds derived from the sale of the surplus are used in\r\npurchasing stock and work animals, and for the further improvement of\r\nthe reservation. Several of the Indians are engaged in cultivating\r\ngardens, while others work as many as twenty-five or thirty acres on\r\ntheir own account.\r\n\r\nThe Indians on this reservation are uniformly quiet and peaceable,\r\nnotwithstanding that they are much disturbed by the white trespassers.\r\nSuits, by direction of the Department, were commenced against such\r\ntrespassers, but without definite results as yet; the Attorney-general\r\nhaving directed the United States District-attorney to suspend\r\nproceedings. Of this reservation the Indian Department has in actual\r\npossession and under fence only about 4000 acres; the remainder being in\r\nthe possession of settlers, all clamorous for breaking up the\r\nreservation and driving the Indians out.\r\n\r\nThe Indians at this reservation have shown no especial disposition to\r\nhave their children educated; and no steps were taken to that end until\r\nin the summer of 1871, when a school was commenced. There is now one\r\nschool in operation, with an attendance of 110 scholars. These Indians\r\nhave no treaties with the Government; and such assistance as is rendered\r\nthem in the shape of clothing, etc., is from the money appropriated for\r\nthe general incidental expenses of the Indian service in the State.\r\n\r\n_Hoopa Valley Agency._—The Indians belonging to this agency are the\r\nHumboldts, Hoonsoltons, Miscotts, Siahs, and several other bands,\r\nnumbering 725.\r\n\r\nA reservation was set apart, per Act of April 8th, 1864, for these and\r\nsuch other Indians in the northern part of the State as might be induced\r\nto settle thereon. This reservation is situated in the north-western\r\npart of the State, on both sides of the Trinity River, and contains\r\n38,400 acres. As a rule, sufficient is raised on the reservation to\r\nsupply the wants of the Indians. These Indians are quiet and peaceable,\r\nand are not disposed to labor on the reservation in common, but will\r\nwork industriously when allowed to do so on their own individual\r\naccount. One school is in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of seventy-four scholars. Having no treaty relations with the\r\nUnited States, and, consequently, no regular annuities appropriated for\r\ntheir benefit, the general incidental fund of the State is used so far\r\nas may be necessary, and so far as the amount appropriated will admit,\r\nto furnish assistance in the shape of clothing, agricultural implements,\r\nseeds, etc. Besides these, their agent has a general supervisory control\r\nof certain Klamath Indians, who live adjacent to the reservation and\r\nalong the banks of the Klamath River. These formerly belonged to a\r\nreservation bearing their name, which was, years ago, abandoned in\r\nconsequence of the total destruction by flood of agency buildings and\r\nimprovements. They now support themselves chiefly by hunting and\r\nfishing, and by cultivating small patches in grain and vegetables.\r\n\r\n_Tule River Farm, or Agency._—The Indians located at this point are the\r\nTules and Manaches, numbering 374. These Indians are gradually\r\nimproving, are quite proficient in all kinds of farm-work, and show a\r\ngood disposition to cultivate the soil on their own account. There is\r\none school in operation at the Tule River Farm, with an attendance of\r\nthirty-seven scholars. About sixty miles from the agency reside several\r\nhundred King's River Indians, who are in a wretched and destitute\r\ncondition. They desire to be attached to the agency, and have in the\r\npast received occasional supplies of food from it.\r\n\r\n_Indians not on Reservations._—In addition to the Indians located at the\r\nthree agencies named, there are probably not less than 20,000, including\r\nthe Mission Indians (so called), the Coahuilas, Owen's River, and\r\nothers, in the southern part of the State; and those on the Klamath,\r\nTrinity, Scott, and Salmon rivers, in the northern part. The Mission\r\nIndians, having been for the past century under the Catholic missions\r\nestablished on the California coast, are tolerably well advanced in\r\nagriculture, and compare favorably with the most highly civilized tribes\r\nof the east. The Coahuilas, and others inhabiting the south-eastern and\r\neastern portions of the State, and those in the north, support\r\nthemselves by working for white settlers, or by hunting, fishing,\r\nbegging, and stealing, except, it may be, a few of the northern Indians,\r\nwho go occasionally to the reservations and the military posts in that\r\nsection for assistance in the way of food.\r\n\r\nThere are also about 4000 Owen's River and Manache Indians east of the\r\nSierras, whom the settlers would gladly see removed to a reservation,\r\nand brought under the care of an agent. The Department has under\r\nconsideration the propriety of establishing a new reservation, upon\r\nwhich shall be concentrated these and numerous other Indians, in which\r\nevent the Tule River Agency could advantageously be discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 REPORT\r\n\r\n          ON THE CONDITION AND NEEDS OF THE MISSION INDIANS OF\r\n          CALIFORNIA, MADE BY SPECIAL AGENTS HELEN JACKSON AND\r\n          ABBOT KINNEY, TO THE COMMISSIONER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Colorado Springs, Col., July 13th, 1883.\r\n\r\nSIR,—In compliance with our instructions bearing dates November 28th,\r\n1882, and January 12th, 1883, we have the honor to submit to you the\r\nfollowing report on the subject of the Mission Indians in Southern\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Mission Indians\" dates back over one hundred years, to the\r\ntime of the Franciscan missions in California. It then included all\r\nIndians who lived in the mission establishments, or were under the care\r\nof the Franciscan Fathers. Very naturally the term has continued to be\r\napplied to the descendants of those Indians. In the classification of\r\nthe Indian Bureau, however, it is now used in a somewhat restricted\r\nsense, embracing only those Indians living in the three southernmost\r\ncounties of California, and known as Serranos, Cahuillas, San Luisenos,\r\nand Dieguinos; the last two names having evidently come from the names\r\nof the southernmost two missions, San Luis Rey and San Diego. A census\r\ntaken in 1880, of these bands, gives their number as follows:\r\n\r\n                  Serranos                         381\r\n                  Cahuillas                        675\r\n                  San Luisenos                   1,120\r\n                  Dieguinos                        731\r\n                                               -------\r\n                  Total                          2,907\r\n\r\nThis estimate probably falls considerably short of the real numbers, as\r\nthere are no doubt in hiding, so to speak, in remote and inaccessible\r\nspots, many individuals, families, or even villages, that have never\r\nbeen counted. These Indians are living for the most part in small and\r\nisolated villages; some on reservations set apart for them by Executive\r\norder; some on Government land not reserved, and some upon lands\r\nincluded within the boundaries of confirmed Mexican grants.\r\n\r\nConsiderable numbers of these Indians are also to be found on the\r\noutskirts of white settlements, as at Riverside, San Bernardino, or in\r\nthe colonies in the San Gabriel Valley, where they live like gypsies in\r\nbrush huts, here to-day, gone to-morrow, eking out a miserable existence\r\nby days' works, the wages of which are too often spent for whiskey in\r\nthe village saloons. Travellers in Southern California, who have formed\r\ntheir impressions of the Mission Indians from these wretched wayside\r\ncreatures, would be greatly surprised at the sight of some of the Indian\r\nvillages in the mountain valleys, where, freer from the contaminating\r\ninfluence of the white race, are industrious, peaceable communities,\r\ncultivating ground, keeping stock, carrying on their own simple\r\nmanufactures of pottery, mats, baskets, &c., and making their living,—a\r\nvery poor living, it is true; but they are independent and\r\nself-respecting in it, and ask nothing at the hands of the United States\r\nGovernment now, except that it will protect them in the ownership of\r\ntheir lands,—lands which, in many instances, have been in continuous\r\noccupation and cultivation by their ancestors for over one hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nFrom tract after tract of such lands they have been driven out, year by\r\nyear, by the white settlers of the country, until they can retreat no\r\nfarther; some of their villages being literally in the last tillable\r\nspot on the desert's edge or in mountain fastnesses. Yet there are in\r\nSouthern California to-day many fertile valleys, which only thirty years\r\nago were like garden spots with these same Indians' wheat-fields,\r\norchards, and vineyards. Now, there is left in these valleys no trace of\r\nthe Indians' occupation, except the ruins of their adobe houses; in some\r\ninstances these houses, still standing, are occupied by the robber\r\nwhites who drove them out. The responsibility for this wrong rests,\r\nperhaps, equally divided between the United States Government, which\r\npermitted lands thus occupied by peaceful agricultural communities to be\r\nput \"in market,\" and the white men who were not restrained either by\r\nhumanity or by a sense of justice, from \"filing\" homestead claims on\r\nlands which had been fenced, irrigated, tilled, and lived on by Indians\r\nfor many generations. The Government cannot justify this neglect on the\r\nplea of ignorance. Repeatedly, in the course of the last thirty years,\r\nboth the regular agents in charge of the Mission Indians and special\r\nagents sent out to investigate their condition have made to the Indian\r\nBureau full reports setting forth these facts.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 one of these special agents, giving an account of the San\r\nPasquale Indians, mentioned the fact that a white man had just\r\npre-empted the land on which the greater part of the village was\r\nsituated. He had paid the price of the land to the register of the\r\ndistrict land office, and was daily expecting his patent from\r\nWashington. \"He owned,\" the agent says, \"that it was hard to wrest from\r\nthese well-disposed and industrious creatures the homes they had built\r\nup; but,\" said he, \"if I had not done it, somebody else would; for all\r\nagree that the Indian has no right to public lands.\" This San Pasquale\r\nvillage was a regularly organized Indian pueblo, formed by about one\r\nhundred neophytes of the San Luis Rey Mission, under and in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of the Secularization Act in 1834. The record of its\r\nfounding is preserved in the Mexican archives at San Francisco. These\r\nIndians had herds of cattle, horses, and sheep; they raised grains, and\r\nhad orchards and vineyards. The whole valley in which this village lay\r\nwas at one time set off by Executive order as a reservation, but by the\r\nefforts of designing men the order was speedily revoked; and no sooner\r\nhas this been done than the process of dispossessing the Indians began.\r\nThere is now, on the site of that old Indian pueblo, a white settlement\r\nnumbering 35 voters. The Indians are all gone,—some to other villages;\r\nsome living near by in cañons and nooks in the hills, from which, on the\r\noccasional visits of the priest, they gather and hold services in the\r\nhalf-ruined adobe chapel built by them in the days of their prosperity.\r\n\r\nThis story of the San Pasquale Indians is only a fair showing of the\r\nexperiences of the Mission Indians during the past fifty years. Almost\r\nwithout exception they have been submissive and peaceable through it\r\nall, and have retreated again and again to new refuges. In a few\r\ninstances there have been slight insurrections among them, and\r\nthreatenings of retaliation; but in the main their history has been one\r\nof almost incredible long suffering and patience under wrongs.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 one of the San Luiseno bands, the Aqua Caliente Indians, in the\r\nnorth part of San Diego County, made an attack on the house of a white\r\nsettler, and there was for a time great fear of a general uprising of\r\nall the Indians in the country. It is probable that this was instigated\r\nby the Mexicans, and that there was a concerted plan for driving the\r\nAmericans out of the country. The outbreak was easily quelled, however;\r\nfour of the chiefs were tried by court-martial and shot by order of\r\nGeneral Heintzelman, and in January of the following year a treaty was\r\nmade with the San Luiseno and Dieguino Indians, setting off for them\r\nlarge tracts of land. This treaty was made by a United States\r\ncommissioner, Dr. Wozencraft, and Lieutenant Hamilton, representing the\r\nArmy, and Col. J. J. Warner, the settler whose house had been attacked.\r\nThe greater part of the lands which were by this treaty assigned to the\r\nIndians are now within the boundaries of grants confirmed and patented\r\nsince that time; but there are many Indian villages still remaining on\r\nthem, and all Indians living on such lands are supposed to be there\r\nsolely on the tolerance and at the mercy of the owners of said ranches,\r\nand to be liable to ejectment by law. Whether this be so or not is a\r\npoint which it would seem to be wise to test before the courts. It is\r\ncertain that in the case of all these Mission Indians the rights\r\ninvolved are quite different from and superior to the mere \"occupancy\"\r\nright of the wild and uncivilized Indian.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the surrender of California to the United States these\r\nMission Indians had been for over seventy years the subjects, first of\r\nthe Spanish Government, secondly of the Mexican. They came under the\r\njurisdiction of the United States by treaty provisions,—the treaty of\r\nGuadalupe Hidalgo, between the United States and Mexico, in 1848. At\r\nthis time they were so far civilized that they had become the chief\r\ndependence of the Mexican and white settlers for all service indoors and\r\nout. In the admirable report upon these Indians made to the Interior\r\nDepartment in 1853, by the Hon. B. D. Wilson, of Los Angeles, are the\r\nfollowing statements:—\r\n\r\n\"These same Indians had built all the houses in the country, planted all\r\nthe fields and vineyards. Under the Missions there were masons,\r\ncarpenters, plasterers, soap-makers, tanners, shoe-makers, blacksmiths,\r\nmillers, bakers, cooks, brick-makers, carters and cart-makers, weavers\r\nand spinners, saddlers, shepherds, agriculturalists, horticulturalists,\r\nvineros, vaqueros; in a word, they filled all the laborious occupations\r\nknown to civilized society.\"\r\n\r\nThe intentions of the Mexican Government toward these Indians were wise\r\nand humane. At this distance of time, and in face of the melancholy\r\nfacts of the Indians' subsequent history, it is painful to go over the\r\ndetails of the plans devised one short half-century ago for their\r\nbenefit. In 1830 there were in the twenty-one missions in California\r\nsome 20,000 or 30,000 Indians, living comfortable and industrious lives\r\nunder the control of the Franciscan Fathers. The Spanish colonization\r\nplan had, from the outset, contemplated the turning of these mission\r\nestablishments into pueblos as soon as the Indians should have become\r\nsufficiently civilized to make this feasible. The Mexican Government,\r\ncarrying out the same general plan, issued in 1833 an act, called the\r\nSecularization Act, decreeing that this change should be made. This act\r\nprovided that the Indians should have assigned to them cattle, horses,\r\nand sheep from the mission herds; also, lands for cultivation. One\r\narticle of Governor Figueroa's regulations for the carrying out of the\r\nSecularization Act provided that there should be given to every head of\r\na family, and to all above twenty-one years of age, though they had no\r\nfamily, a lot of land not exceeding 400 varas square, nor less than 100.\r\nThere was also to be given to them in common, enough land for pasturing\r\nand watering their cattle. Another article provided that one-half the\r\ncattle of each mission school should be divided among the Indians of\r\nthat mission in a proportionable and equitable manner; also one-half of\r\nthe chattels, instruments, seeds, &c. Restrictions were to be placed on\r\nthe disposition of this property. The Indians were forbidden \"to sell,\r\nburden, or alienate under any pretext the lands given them. Neither can\r\nthey sell the cattle.\" The commissioners charged with the carrying out\r\nof these provisions were ordered to \"explain all the arrangements to the\r\nIndians with suavity and patience;\" to tell them that the lands and\r\nproperty will be divided among them so that each one may \"work,\r\nmaintain, and govern himself without dependence on any one.\" It was also\r\nprovided that the rancherias (villages) situated at a distance from the\r\nmissions, and containing over twenty-five families, might, if they\r\nchose, form separate pueblos, and the distribution of lands and property\r\nto them should take place in the same manner provided for those living\r\nnear the missions.\r\n\r\nThese provisions were in no case faithfully carried out. The\r\nadministration of the Missions' vast estates and property was too great\r\na temptation for human nature, especially in a time of revolution and\r\nmisrule. The history of the thirteen years between the passing of the\r\nSecularization Act and the conquest of California is a record of\r\nshameful fraud and pillage, of which the Indians were the most hapless\r\nvictims. Instead of being permitted each one to work, maintain, and\r\ngovern himself without dependence on any one, as they had been promised,\r\ntheir rights to their plats of land were in the majority of cases\r\nignored; they were forced to labor on the mission lands like slaves; in\r\nmany instances they were hired out in gangs to cruel masters. From these\r\ncruelties and oppressions they fled by hundreds, returning to their old\r\nwilderness homes. Those who remained in the neighborhood of the pueblos\r\nbecame constantly more and more demoralized, and were subjected to every\r\nform of outrage. By a decree of the Los Angeles aqumiento, about the\r\ntime of our taking possession of California, all Indians found without\r\npasses, either from the alcalde of the pueblos in which they lived, or\r\nfrom their \"masters [significant phrase], were to be treated as\r\nhorse-thieves and enemies.\" At this time there were, according to Mr.\r\nWilson's report, whole streets in Los Angeles where every other house\r\nwas a grog-shop for Indians; and every Saturday night the town was\r\nfilled with Indians in every stage of intoxication. Those who were\r\nhelpless and insensible were carried to the jail, locked up, and on\r\nMonday morning bound out to the highest bidders at the jail gates. \"The\r\nIndian has a quick sense of justice,\" says Mr. Wilson; \"he can never see\r\nwhy he is sold out to service for an indefinite period for intemperance,\r\nwhile the white man goes unpunished for the same thing, and the very\r\nrichest and best men, to his eye, are such as tempt him to drink, and\r\nsometimes will pay him for his labor in no other way.\" Even the sober\r\nand industrious and best skilled among them could earn but little; it\r\nhaving become a custom to pay an Indian only half the wages of a white\r\nman.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief and necessarily fragmentary sketch of the position and\r\nstate of the Mission Indians under the Mexican Government, at the time\r\nof the surrender of California to the United States, it will be seen\r\nthat our Government received by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo a legacy\r\nof a singularly helpless race in a singularly anomalous position. It\r\nwould have been very difficult, even at the outset, to devise\r\npracticable methods of dealing justly with these people, and preserving\r\nto them their rights. But with every year of our neglect the\r\ndifficulties have increased and the wrongs have been multiplied, until\r\nnow it is, humanly speaking, impossible to render to them full measure\r\nof justice. All that is left in our power is to make them some\r\natonement. Fortunately for them, their numbers have greatly diminished.\r\nSuffering, hunger, disease, and vice have cut down more than half of\r\ntheir numbers in the last thirty years; but the remnant is worth saving.\r\nSetting aside all question of their claim as a matter of atonement for\r\ninjustice done, they are deserving of help on their own merits. No one\r\ncan visit their settlements, such as Aqua Caliente, Saboba, Cahuilla\r\nValley, Santa Ysabel, without having a sentiment of respect and profound\r\nsympathy for men who, friendless, poor, without protection from the law,\r\nhave still continued to work, planting, fencing, irrigating, building\r\nhouses on lands from which long experience has taught them that the\r\nwhite man can drive them off any day he chooses. That drunkenness,\r\ngambling, and other immoralities are sadly prevalent among them, cannot\r\nbe denied; but the only wonder is that so many remain honest and\r\nvirtuous under conditions which make practically null and void for them\r\nmost of the motives which keep white men honest and virtuous.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given as brief a presentation as possible of the general\r\nsituation and nature of these Indians, we will proceed to state what, to\r\nthe best of our judgment, are the steps which ought to be taken by the\r\nUnited States Government in their behalf. The descriptions of the most\r\nimportant villages we visited, and the detailed accounts of\r\ncircumstances and situations on which our suggestions are based, are\r\ngiven for convenience of reference in separate exhibits.\r\n\r\n1st. The first and most essential step, without which there is no\r\npossibility of protecting these Indians or doing anything intelligently\r\nfor them, is the determining, resurveying, rounding out, and distinctly\r\nmarking, their reservations already existing. The only way of having\r\nthis done accurately and honestly, is to have it done by a surveyor who\r\nis under the orders and constant supervision of an intelligent and\r\nhonest commissioner; not by an independent surveyor who runs or \"floats\"\r\nreservation lines where he and his friends or interested parties choose,\r\ninstead of where the purpose of the United States Government, looking to\r\nthe Indians' interests, had intended. There have been too many surveys\r\nof Indian reservations in Southern California of this sort. (See\r\nExhibits C, H, I, J, L.) All the reservations made in 1876—and that\r\ncomprises nearly all now existing—were laid off by guess, by the\r\nsurveyor in San Diego, on an imperfect county map. These sections, thus\r\nguessed at by the surveyor, were reported by the commissioner to the\r\nInterior Department, set aside by Executive order, and ordered to be\r\nsurveyed. When the actual survey came to be made, it was discovered that\r\nin the majority of cases the Indian villages intended to be provided for\r\nwere outside the reservation lines, and that the greater part of the\r\nlands set apart were wholly worthless. The plats of these reservations\r\nare in the surveyor-general's office at San Francisco. On each of them\r\nwas marked by the surveyor an additional line in color, showing what\r\ntracts ought to be added to take in the Indian villages and fields. So\r\nfar as we could learn, no action was taken in regard to these proposed\r\nadditions.\r\n\r\nThe reservation lines, when thus defined, should be marked plainly and\r\nconspicuously by monuments and stakes, leaving no room for doubt. A plat\r\nof each reservation should then be given to the Indians living on it. It\r\nwas pathetic, in our visits to village after village, to hear the\r\nIndians' request reiterated for this thing,—\"a paper to show to the\r\nwhite men where their lands were.\" Every fragment of writing they had\r\never received, which could by any possibility bear on their title to\r\ntheir lands, they had carefully preserved; old tattered orders from Army\r\nofficers thirty years back, orders from justices of the peace, &c., all\r\nworthless of course, but brought forward with touching earnestness to\r\nshow us. In no single instance had the reservation lines ever been\r\npointed out to them. One band, the Sequan Indians, who had never seen\r\nany agent, said they had been told that they were on a reservation, but\r\nthey did not know if it were true or not. They had been obliged to give\r\nup keeping stock, because they could not find any place where the whites\r\nwould let them pasture cattle. (See Exhibit J.)\r\n\r\nThere are some settlements of Indians on Government lands not set off as\r\nreservations, in some instances not surveyed. These tracts should all be\r\nsurveyed, their boundaries marked, and the lands withdrawn from market\r\nto be permanently set aside for the Indians' use. We use the term\r\n\"rounding out\" in regard to these reservations chiefly on account of the\r\ncomplication which results from their being in some cases within the\r\nlimit of railroad grants, and made subsequent to those grants. Some are\r\nactually within the limits of the Southern Pacific Railroad grant;\r\nothers will be within the limits of the Texas Pacific grant, should that\r\nbe confirmed. The odd sections thus belonging to the railroads should be\r\nsecured to the Indians. There are also a few claims to lands within\r\nreservation boundaries, which are legal on account of their having been\r\nmade before the reservations were set off. These should be extinguished.\r\n(See Exhibit O.)\r\n\r\n2d. All white settlers now on reservations should be removed. For the\r\nlast four years stray settlers have been going in upon reservation\r\ntracts. This is owing to the lack of boundary definitions and marks as\r\naforesaid, also to the failure of the surveys to locate the reservations\r\nso as to take in all the ground actually occupied by Indian villages.\r\nThus, in many instances, the Indians' fields and settlements have been\r\nwrested from them, and they in their turn have not known where they\r\ncould or could not go. There is not a single reservation of any size\r\nwhich is free from white settlers. It would seem that agents in charge\r\nof these Indians should have been authoritatively instructed in no case\r\nto allow squatters to settle on lands known to be within reservation\r\nlines, whether they were occupied by Indians or not. (See Exhibits H, I,\r\nO.)\r\n\r\nThe amount of land set off in Indian reservations in Southern California\r\nappears by the record to be very large, but the proportion of it which\r\nis really available is very small. San Diego County itself is\r\nfour-fifths desert and mountain, and it is no exaggeration to say that\r\nthe proportion of desert and mountain in the reservation is even larger\r\nthan this. By thus resurveying, rounding out, and freeing from white\r\nsettlers the present reservations, adding to them all Government lands\r\nnow actually in occupation by Indians, there will be, according to the\r\nbest of our judgment, nearly land enough for the accommodation of all\r\nthe Mission Indians except those whose settlements are on grants.\r\n\r\n3d. In regard to this latter class, _i.e._, those whose villages are now\r\nwithin the boundaries of confirmed grants, the Government has to choose\r\nbetween two courses of action,—either to remove them and make other\r\nprovision for them, or to uphold and defend their right to remain where\r\nthey are. In support of the latter course we believe a strong case could\r\nbe made out, and we have secured from one of the ablest firms in\r\nSouthern California a written legal opinion on this point. (See Exhibit\r\nA.) It seems clear that this contest should be made by the Government\r\nitself. It is impossible for these poverty-stricken and ignorant people\r\nto undertake on their own account and at their own expense the legal\r\nsettlement of this matter. It would be foolish to advise it; inhuman to\r\nexpect it. A test case could be made which would settle the question for\r\nall. (See Exhibit B.) In case the decision be favorable to the Indians\r\nremaining, the ranch owners should then be called on to mark off the\r\nboundaries of the Indians' lands according to the California State law\r\ncovering such cases. (See Exhibit R.) Whether the lands thus reverting\r\nto the Indians could properly be considered as Government lands or not,\r\nwould be a question to be determined. Probably the surest way of\r\nsecuring them for the Indians' permanent use would be to consider them\r\nas such and have them defined as reservations by act of Congress.\r\n\r\n4th. And this brings us to our fourth recommendation, which is, that all\r\nthese Indians' reservations, those already set off by Executive order,\r\nand all new ones made for them, whether of Government lands now in their\r\noccupation, or of lands which may be hereafter by legal process\r\nreclaimed for them from the grant lands on which they are now living, be\r\npatented to the several bands occupying them; the United States to hold\r\nthe patent in trust for the period of twenty-five years; at the\r\nexpiration of that time the United States to convey the same by patent\r\nto said Indians, as has been done for the Omaha Indians. The insecurity\r\nof reservations made merely by Executive order is apparent, and is\r\nalready sadly illustrated in Southern California by the history of the\r\nSan Pasquale Reservation, that of Aqua Caliente, and others. The\r\ninsecurity of reservations set apart by act of Congress is only a degree\r\nless. The moment it becomes the interest and purpose of white men in any\r\nsection of the country to have such reservation tracts restored to the\r\npublic domain, the question of its being done is only a question of\r\ninfluence and time. It is sure to be done. The future of these\r\nindustrious, peaceable, agricultural communities ought not to be left a\r\nsingle day longer than is necessary, dependent on such chances; chances\r\nwhich are always against and never for Indians' interests in the matter\r\nof holding lands. The best way and time of allotting these Indians'\r\nlands to them in severalty must be left to the decision of the\r\nGovernment, a provision being incorporated in their patent to provide\r\nfor such allotments from time to time as may seem desirable, and agents\r\nand commissioners being instructed to keep the advantages of this system\r\nconstantly before the Indians' minds. Some of them are fit for it now,\r\nand earnestly desire it, but the majority are not ready for it. The\r\ncommunal system, on which those now living in villages use their lands,\r\nsatisfies them, and is apparently administered without difficulty. It is\r\nprecisely the same system as that on which the pueblo lands were\r\ncultivated by the early Spanish settlers in Southern California. They\r\nagree among themselves to respect each other's right of occupancy; a\r\nman's right to a field this year depending on his having cultivated it\r\nlast year, and so on. It seems not to occur to these Indians that land\r\nis a thing to be quarrelled over.\r\n\r\nIn the village of Aqua Caliente, one of the most intelligent of the\r\nyoung men was so anxious to show us his fields that we went with him a\r\nlittle distance outside the village limits to see them. He had some\r\neight acres in grain, vine, and fruit trees. Pointing first in one\r\ndirection, then in another, he indicated the places where his ground\r\njoined other men's ground. There was no line of demarcation whatever,\r\nexcept it chanced to be a difference of crops. We said to him,\r\n\"Alessandro, how do you know which is your land and which is theirs?\" He\r\nseemed perplexed, and replied, \"This was my mother's land. We have\r\nalways had it.\" \"But,\" we persisted, \"suppose one of these other men\r\nshould want more land and should take a piece of yours?\" \"He couldn't,\"\r\nwas all the reply we could get from Alessandro, and it was plain that he\r\nwas greatly puzzled by the suggestion of the possibility of neighbors\r\ntrespassing on each other's cultivated fields.\r\n\r\n5th. We recommend the establishment of more schools. At least two more\r\nare immediately needed, one at the Rincon, and one at Santa Ysabel. (See\r\nExhibits G, L.) As the reservations are gradually cleared, defined and\r\nassured for the Indians' occupancy, hundreds of Indians who are now\r\nroving from place to place, without fixed homes, will undoubtedly settle\r\ndown in the villages, and more schools will be needed. It is to be\r\nhoped, also, that some of the smaller bands will unite with the larger\r\nones, for the sake of the advantages of the school and other advantages\r\nof a larger community. The isolated situation of many of the smaller\r\nsettlements is now an insuperable difficulty in the way of providing\r\neducation for all the children. These Indians are all keenly alive to\r\nthe value of education. In every village that we visited we were urged\r\nto ask the Government to give them a school. In one they insisted upon\r\nranging the children all in rows, that we might see for ourselves that\r\nthere were children enough to justify the establishing of a school.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we would suggest that if a boarding and industrial\r\nschool, similar to those at Hampton and Carlisle, could be established\r\nin Southern California, it would be of inestimable value, and would\r\nprovide opportunities for many children who, owing to the isolation of\r\ntheir homes, could not be reached in any other way.\r\n\r\nWe would further suggest that, in our judgment, only women teachers\r\nshould be employed in these isolated Indian villages. There is a great\r\nlaxity of morals among these Indians; and in the wild regions where\r\ntheir villages lie, the unwritten law of public sentiment, which in more\r\ncivilized communities does so much to keep men virtuous, hardly exists.\r\nTherefore the post of teacher in these schools is one full of\r\ntemptations and danger to a man. (See Exhibit M.) Moreover, women have\r\nmore courage and self-denying missionary spirit, sufficient to undertake\r\nsuch a life, and have an invaluable influence outside their\r\nschool-rooms. They go familiarly into the homes, and are really\r\neducating the parents as well as the children in a way which is not\r\nwithin the power of any man, however earnest and devoted he may be.\r\n\r\nWe would also suggest that great good might be accomplished among these\r\nIndians by some form of itinerary religious and educational labor among\r\nthem. In the list of assignments of Indian agencies to different\r\nreligious denominations, as given in the report of the Indian Bureau for\r\n1882, the Mission Agency is assigned to the Evangelical Lutheran; but we\r\ncould not learn that this denomination had done any work among them. So\r\nfar as the Mission Indians have any religion at all they are Catholics.\r\nIn many of the villages are adobe chapels, built in the time of the\r\nmissions, where are still preserved many relics of the mission days,\r\nsuch as saints' images, holy-water kettles, &c. In these chapels on the\r\noccasions of the priest's visits the Indians gather in great numbers,\r\nwomen sometimes walking two days' journey, bringing their babies on\r\ntheir backs to have them baptized. There are also in several of the\r\nvillages old Indians, formerly trained at the missions, who officiate\r\nwith Catholic rites at funerals, and on Sundays repeat parts of the\r\nMass. As these Indians are now situated in isolated settlements so far\r\napart, and so remote from civilized centres, the only practicable method\r\nof reaching them all would be by some form of itinerary labor. A fervent\r\nreligious and practical teacher, who should spend his time in going from\r\nvillage to village, remaining in each a few days or weeks, as the case\r\nmight be, would sow seed which would not cease to grow during the\r\nintervals of his absence. If he were a man of sound common-sense and\r\nknowledge of laws of life, fitted to instruct the Indians in matters of\r\nhygiene, cleanliness, ventilation, &c., and in a few of the simple\r\nmechanical arts, as well as in the doctrines of religion and morality,\r\nhe would do more for the real good of these people at present than can\r\nbe accomplished by schools.\r\n\r\n6th. The suggestion of the value of itinerary labor among the Indians\r\nleads to our next recommendation, which we consider of great importance,\r\n_viz._, that it should be made the duty of any Government agent in\r\ncharge of the Mission Indians to make a round of inspection at least\r\ntwice a year, visiting each village or settlement however small. In no\r\nother way can anything like a proper supervision of these Indians'\r\ninterests be attained. This proof of the Government's intention to keep\r\na sharp eye on all that might occur in relation to the Indians would\r\nhave a salutary moral effect, not only on the Indians, but on the white\r\nsettlers in their neighborhood. It would also afford the means of\r\ndealing with comparative promptitude with the difficulties and troubles\r\ncontinually arising. As it is now, it is not to be wondered at that the\r\nIndians feel themselves unprotected and neglected, and the white\r\nsettlers feel themselves safe in trespassing on Indians' property or\r\npersons. In some of the villages, where pre-emption claims have been\r\nlocated within the last four years, no agent has ever been. It is safe\r\nto say, that had an agent been on the ground each year, with the proper\r\nauthority to take efficient measures, much of the present suffering and\r\nconfusion would have been prevented. In the case, for instance, of the\r\nLos Coyotes village, filed on a few months ago (see Exhibit F), there\r\nwas no reason why those lands should not have been set apart for the\r\nIndians long ago, had their situation been understood; so in the San\r\nYsidro case, and others. The whole situation of an agent in regard to\r\nthe Mission Indians is totally different from that of ordinary agency on\r\na reservation. The duties of an Indian agent on a reservation may be\r\nonerous, but they are in a sense simple. His Indians are all together,\r\nwithin comparatively narrow limits, and, so to speak, under his hand,\r\nand dependent largely on the Government. The Mission Indians, on the\r\ncontrary, are scattered in isolated settlements thirty, forty, a hundred\r\nmiles away from the agency headquarters, many of them in regions\r\ndifficult of access. Moreover, the Indians are in the main\r\nself-supporting and independent. Protection or oversight worth anything\r\nto them can only be given by a systematic method of frequent visitation.\r\n\r\nWhat is true in this respect of the agent's work is, if possible, still\r\ntruer of the physician's. If there is to be an agency physician for the\r\nMission Indians at all, he should be a young, strong, energetic man, who\r\nis both able and willing to make at least four circuits a year through\r\nthe villages, and who will hold himself bound to go when called in all\r\ncases of epidemics, serious illness, or accidents occurring among\r\nIndians within one day's journey of the agency headquarters. Whatever\r\nsalary it is necessary to pay to secure such service as this should be\r\npaid, or else the office of agency physician to the Mission Indians\r\nshould be abolished. Anything less than this is a farce and a fraud.\r\n\r\n7th. We recommend that there be secured the appointment of a lawyer, or\r\na law firm in Los Angeles, to act as special United States attorney in\r\nall cases affecting the interests of these Indians. They have been so\r\nlong without any protection from the law that outrages and depredations\r\nupon them have become the practice in all white communities near which\r\nthey live. Indians' stock is seized, corraled and held for fines,\r\nsometimes shot, even on the Indians' own reservations or in the public\r\ndomain. In seasons of dearth roving stockmen and shepherds drive their\r\nherds and flocks into Indians' grain-fields, destroying their\r\nsubsistence for a whole year. Lands occupied by Indians or by Indian\r\nvillages are filed on for homestead entry precisely as if they were\r\nvacant lands. This has been more than once done without the Indians\r\nreceiving any warning until the sheriff arrived with the writ for their\r\nejectment. The Indians' own lives are in continual danger, it being a\r\nsafe thing to shoot an Indian at any time when only Indian witnesses are\r\npresent. (See Exhibits C, E.) It is plain that all such cases as these\r\nshould be promptly dealt with by equal means. One of the greatest\r\ndifficulties in the position of the Mission Indians' agent is, that in\r\nall such cases he is powerless to act except through the at best slow\r\nand hitherto unsatisfactory channel of reporting to the Interior\r\nDepartment. He is in the embarrassing position of a guardian of wards\r\nwith property and property rights, for the defence of which he is unable\r\nto call in prompt legal assistance. In instances in which the Indians\r\nthemselves have endeavored to get redress through the courts, they have\r\nin the majority of cases—to the shame of the Southern California bar be\r\nit spoken—been egregiously cheated. They are as helpless as children in\r\nthe hands of dishonest, unscrupulous men. We believe that the mere fact\r\nof there being such a United States legal authority near at hand to act\r\nfor the Indians would in a short time, after a few effective\r\nillustrations of its power, do away with the greater proportion of the\r\ntroubles demanding legal interference.\r\n\r\nThe question of the rights of Indians living on grant lands to remain\r\nthere will, if the Department decides to test it by law, involve some\r\nlitigation, as it will no doubt be contested by the ranch owners; but\r\nthis point once settled, and the Indians secured in the ownership of\r\ntheir lands, a very few years will see the end of any special need of\r\nlitigation in their behalf. We recommend in this connection and for this\r\noffice the firm of Brunson & Wells, of Los Angeles. We have obtained\r\nfrom this firm a clear and admirable opinion on these Indians' right to\r\ntheir present homes (see Exhibit A), and we know them to be of high\r\nstanding at the bar and to have a humane sympathy for Indians.\r\n\r\n8th. We recommend that there should be a judicious distribution of\r\nagricultural implements among these Indians. No village should be\r\nomitted. Wagons, harness, ploughs, spades, and hoes are greatly needed.\r\nIt is surprising to see what some of these villages have accomplished\r\nwith next to no implements. In the Santa Ysabel village the Indians had\r\nthree hundred acres in wheat; there were but three old broken ploughs in\r\nthe village, no harness, and no wagon. (See Exhibit G.) There is at\r\npresent much, and not unfounded, sore feeling in some of the villages\r\nwhich have thus far received no help of this kind, while others of the\r\nvillages have been supplied with all that was needed.\r\n\r\n9th. There should always be provided for the Mission Indians' agency a\r\nsmall fund for the purchase of food and clothing for the very old and\r\nsick in times of especial destitution. The Mission Indians as a class do\r\nnot beg. They are proud-spirited, and choose to earn their living. They\r\nwill endure a great deal before they will ask for help. But in seasons\r\nof drought or when their little crops have, for any cause, failed, there\r\nis sometimes great distress in the villages. Last winter the Cahuillas,\r\nin the Cahuilla Valley (see Exhibit C), were for many weeks without\r\nsufficient food. The teacher of their school repeatedly begged them to\r\nlet her write to the agent for help, but they refused. At last one night\r\nthe captain and two of the head men came to her room and said she might\r\nwrite. They could no longer subdue the hunger. She wrote the letter; the\r\nnext morning at daylight the Indians were at her door again. They had\r\nreconsidered it, they said, and they would not beg. They would rather\r\nstarve, and they would not permit her to send the letter.\r\n\r\n10th. The second and third special points on which we were instructed to\r\nreport to the Department were, whether there still remains in Southern\r\nCalifornia any Government land suitable for an Indian reservation, and\r\nif not, in case lands must be bought for that purpose, what lands can be\r\nmost advantageously purchased. There is no Government land remaining in\r\nSouthern California in blocks of any size suitable for either white or\r\nIndian occupancy. The reason that the isolated little settlements of\r\nIndians are being now so infringed upon and seized, even at the desert's\r\nedge and in stony fastnesses of mountains, is that all the good\r\nlands—_i.e._, lands with water or upon which water can be developed—are\r\ntaken up.\r\n\r\nWe recommend two purchases of land,—one positively, the other\r\ncontingently. The first is the Pauma Ranch, now owned by Bishop Mora, of\r\nLos Angeles. (See Exhibit P.) This ranch, lying as it does between the\r\nRincon and Pala Reservations on the north and south, and adjoining the\r\nLa Jolla Reservation, affords an admirable opportunity to consolidate a\r\nlarge block of land for Indian occupancy. It is now, in our opinion, a\r\ndesirable tract. While it is largely hilly and mountainous, there is\r\nconsiderable good sheep and cattle pasturing on it, and a fair amount of\r\nbottom land for cultivation along the river. The price asked for it is,\r\nas lands are now selling in Southern California, low. If the already\r\nexisting reservations are cleared of whites, unified, and made ready for\r\nIndian occupancy, and the Government lands now in actual occupation by\r\nIndians be assured to them, the addition of this Pauma Ranch will be, in\r\nour opinion, all that will be required to make comfortable provision for\r\nall the Indians, except those living within the boundaries of confirmed\r\ngrants.\r\n\r\nShould the Department decide to remove all these and provide them with\r\nnew homes, we recommend the purchase of the Santa Ysabel ranch. (See\r\nExhibit Q.) The purchase of this ranch for an Indian reservation was\r\nrecommended to the Government some years ago, but it was rejected on\r\naccount of the excessive price asked for it. It is now offered to the\r\nGovernment for $95,000. During the past ten years the value of lands in\r\nSouthern California has in many places quadrupled; in some it is worth\r\nmore than twenty times what it was then. We have no hesitation in saying\r\nthat it is not now possible to buy an equally suitable tract for any\r\nless money. The ranch contains 17,719.40 acres; is within the rain belt\r\nof San Diego County, is well watered, and, although it is largely\r\nmountainous, has good pasture, some meadow land, and some oak timber. It\r\nis, moreover, in the region to which the greater proportion of these\r\nIndians are warmly attached and in the vicinity of which most of them\r\nare now living. One large Indian village is on the ranch. (See Exhibit\r\nG.) Father Ubach, the Catholic priest of San Diego, who has known these\r\nIndians for seventeen years, says of it, \"it is the only tract to which\r\nhuman power can force these Indians to remove.\" We recommend this\r\npurchase only as a last resort in the event of the Department's being\r\ncompelled to provide new homes for all the Indians now living within the\r\nboundaries of confirmed grants.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we would make the suggestion that there are several small\r\nbands of Mission Indians north of the boundaries of the so-called\r\nMission Indians' agency, for whom it would seem to be the duty of the\r\nGovernment to care as well as for those already enumerated. One of these\r\nis the San Carlos Indians, living near the old San Carlos Mission at\r\nMonterey. There are nearly one hundred of these, and they are living on\r\nlands which were given to them before the Secularization Act in 1834.\r\nThese lands are close to the boundaries of the ranch San Francisquito of\r\nMonterey. These boundaries have been three times extended, each time\r\ntaking in a few more acres of the Indians' lands, until now they have\r\nonly ten or twelve acres left. There are also some very destitute\r\nIndians living in the neighborhood of the San Antonio Mission, some\r\nsixty miles south of Monterey, and of San Miguel, forty miles farther\r\nsouth, and of Santa Juez near Santa Barbara. These Indians should not be\r\noverlooked in arrangements made for the final establishing of the\r\nMission Indians in Southern California.\r\n\r\nHoping that these recommendations may be approved by the Department, we\r\nare,\r\n\r\n                        Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                          HELEN JACKSON.\r\n                                                           ABBOT KINNEY.\r\n\r\nHON.

Have civilized Indians and those who are engaged in agriculture or\r\nlabor of any kind, and also those who are known as Pueblos or Rancheros\r\nIndians in California, a right to occupy and possess lands which they\r\nand their predecessors had continuously occupied, possessed, and enjoyed\r\nwhile said lands were under the jurisdiction of the Mexican Government,\r\nup to and at the date of the ratification of the treaty Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo between the United States and the Mexican Republic, March, 1848,\r\nnotwithstanding that said lands so occupied and enjoyed by the Indians\r\naforesaid had been while they were so occupying and possessing the same,\r\nby the proper Spanish and Mexican authorities before the ratification of\r\nsaid treaty granted to certain Spanish and Mexican citizens, and since\r\nthe acquisition by the United States of the territory embracing said\r\nlands so granted been by the United States confirmed, surveyed, and\r\npatented to the grantees or their legal representatives?\r\n\r\n2d. Has the United States Government the right to condemn lands within\r\nthe State of California for the purpose of giving Indians homes thereon?\r\n\r\nWe have the honor to submit the following as our reply and answer to the\r\nabove interrogatories. Before and at the date of the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo, all the territory now known as California was a part of and\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the Mexican Republic. We do not regard it as\r\nnecessary, in order to answer the questions propounded, to give a\r\nhistory of the land-laws of Spain and Mexico, nor the method of\r\nacquiring land prior to August 18th, 1824.\r\n\r\nOn August 18th, 1824, the Mexican Congress enacted a general\r\ncolonization law, prescribing the mode of granting lands throughout the\r\nMexican territory. This law was limited and defined by a series of\r\nregulations ordained by the Mexican Government, November 21st, 1828. By\r\nthese laws and regulations, which have ever since continued in force,\r\nthe governors of Territories were authorized to grant, with certain\r\nspecified exceptions, vacant land. By the fundamental laws of 1824, the\r\nregulations of 1824, and the regulations of the departmental legislature\r\nconsistent therewith, all Mexican grants in California have been\r\ndetermined; and by this has been determined the validity of every grant\r\nof land in California. (Lesse & Vallejo _vs._ Clark, 3 Cal. 17.) The\r\nlimitations, as well as the fundamental laws mentioned, provided that in\r\nmaking grants or distribution of land (such as are now known as Mexican\r\ngrants),—\r\n\r\n1st. It must be vacant land, and, if occupied by Indians, then without\r\nprejudice to them.\r\n\r\n2d. That such land as would be granted to the damage and injury of the\r\nIndians should be returned to the rightful owners.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Government reserved from private grant all lands occupied\r\nand possessed by the Indians. Great care was taken to make strict\r\nreservation of such land; and by law no valid grant of land occupied or\r\npossessed by Indians could be made so as to dispossess them. When\r\nCalifornia was ceded to the United States, the rights of property of its\r\ncitizens remained unchanged. By the law of nations those rights were\r\nsacred and inviolable, and the obligations passed to the new government\r\nto protect and maintain them. The term property, as applied to lands,\r\nembraces all titles, legal or equitable, perfect or imperfect.\r\n(Teschemacher _vs._ Thompson, 18 Cal. 12.) The United States never had,\r\nand does not now possess, any power under or by virtue of said treaty\r\nwhereby it could or can confer upon a citizen holding and claiming\r\nproperty granted by the Mexican Government other or different property\r\nrights than those conferred by such Government, and such as were\r\npossessed, enjoyed, and held by him while under the jurisdiction of such\r\ngovernment. It cannot abridge or enlarge the right to enjoy and to\r\npossess property held by virtue of Mexican law at the date of said\r\ntreaty, nor can it deprive persons of any right to property which\r\nbelonged to them at the date of said treaty.\r\n\r\nA mere grant of land by the Mexican governor without compliance by the\r\ngrantee with the further requisitions of the Mexican laws forms but an\r\ninchoate title, and the land passed to the United States, which hold it\r\nsubject to the trust imposed by the treaty and the equities of the\r\ngrantee. _The execution of the trust is a political power._ (Lesse _vs._\r\nClark, 3 Cal. 17.)\r\n\r\nBy the fundamental laws of 1824, the regulation of 1828, and the\r\nregulation of the departmental legislature, one condition was that in\r\nmaking private grants of lands the lands granted must be vacant lands.\r\nLands occupied by and in possession of Indians were not such vacant\r\nlands; for by the same laws and regulations it was provided that such\r\ngrants must be without prejudice or damage to the Indians, and that such\r\nland granted to the damage and injury of the Indians should be returned\r\nto the rightful owners. (New Code, law 9, title 12, book 4.)\r\n\r\nThe Mexican authorities recognized the rights of Indians to hold, enjoy,\r\nand possess lands, and there are of record a number of grants made by\r\nthe Mexican authorities to Indians. They not only had the right to\r\nreceive grants of land under the Mexican laws, but also to convey the\r\nlands so granted. (United States _vs._ Sinnol, Hoffman's Reports, 110.)\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that at the date when private grants of land were\r\nmade with some regard for law, the limitation and conditions required by\r\nlaw to be observed were inserted in such grants, _viz._: L.C., No.\r\n342-6, S. D., 398; L. C., No. 254-219, S. D., 228-407; L. C., No.\r\n740-372, N. D., 208; L. C., No. 326-359, N. D., 389; Hoffman's Report\r\nLand Cases, pp. 35 _et seq._; Surveyor-General's letter, dated San\r\nFrancisco, March 14, 1883, and addressed to Mrs. William S. Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe Indians and their descendants, who occupied and now occupy lands\r\nwithin the grants above named, as well as grants containing claims of a\r\nsimilar character, are in our opinion possessed and seized of the lands\r\nwhich were and have been and now are in their possession; and they can\r\nhold the same against persons claiming the same by virtue of a United\r\nStates patent, issued upon a confirmed Mexican grant. This leaves to be\r\nanswered the following question: Can the Indians hold lands for which a\r\nUnited States patent has issued conditioned as set out in the first\r\nquestion, provided no conditions or limitations are contained or\r\nexpressed in the grant? This is a question beset and surrounded by many\r\ndifficulties; nor do we deem it necessary to do more than refer to\r\nrestrictions and limitations contained in the laws of Mexico concerning\r\nprivate grants of lands upon which Indians were residing,—lands which\r\nwere occupied by them. It is certain that if such lands were granted by\r\na Mexican official, and the authorities omitted to recite the conditions\r\nand limitations required by law, and reserve from the operation of such\r\ngrant such lands as the law conditioned could not be conveyed by such\r\ngrant, such a grant would and could not take it out of the operation of\r\nthe law. It could not defeat the rights of those whose rights attached\r\nby reason of law. If the officers of the Mexican Government to whom was\r\nconfided the trust exceeded their authority as regulated by the\r\nsolemnities and formalities of the law, the courts are bound to take\r\nnotice of it, and cannot shield those claiming under such title from the\r\nnecessary consequence of ignorance, carelessness, or arbitrary\r\nassumption of power. (Lesse & Vallejo _vs._ Clark, 3 Cal. 17.)\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to inquire how far and to what extent will the\r\nissuance to the grantee of the United States patent change or modify\r\nthis rule. We shall not discuss, as we do not deem it necessary, the\r\ndecision of the United States Supreme Court, that \"a United States\r\npatent cannot be attached collaterally, but may be by a direct\r\nproceeding,\" as we did not regard these decisions as in any way\r\naffecting the question submitted and now before us.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, March 3d, Congress passed an act entitled \"An act to ascertain\r\nand settle the private land-claims in the State of California.\" By said\r\nstatute it was enacted \"that it shall be the duty of the commission\r\nherein provided for to ascertain and report to the Secretary of the\r\nInterior the tenure by which the Mission lands are held, and those held\r\nby civilized Indians, and those who are engaged in agriculture or labor\r\nof any _kind_, and also those which are _occupied_ and cultivated by\r\nPueblos or Rancheros Indians.\" (U. S. Statutes at Large, vol. ix. p.\r\n634, sec. 16, Little & Brown's ed.) We have no means of ascertaining\r\nwhether such a report was made, or, if made, its contents. We have no\r\ndoubt the commission did their duty and complied with the law, and that\r\ntheir report will be found on file in the Department of the Interior.\r\nThis report, if in our hands, would greatly aid us in reaching a correct\r\nconclusion. By the same act it is further provided that the patent of\r\nthe United States issued to parties holding Mexican grants are\r\nconclusive between the United States and the said claimants only, and\r\nshall not affect the interest of that person. (_Ib._ p. 634.) If the\r\nreport of the commission established the fact that the Indians were\r\nresiding upon and occupying lands within the boundaries of claimed\r\ngrants, which grants have no conditions or limitation inserted therein,\r\nthat they claimed such lands by virtue of the laws of Mexico, this\r\nevidence, with such other evidence as we understand can be furnished, is\r\nin our opinion enough to establish under the law, as we regard it, a\r\nright in the Indians to hold and occupy such lands against the confirmee\r\nor patentee. If, however, no such report has been made, we are of the\r\nopinion, if conclusive evidence can be furnished proving that these\r\nIndians were in possession of these lands at the time these grants were\r\nmade by the Mexican authorities, that they continued in possession, and\r\nwere in possession at the date of the treaty, and have since continued\r\nin possession, the law will entitle them to hold such land against all\r\npersons claiming under the patent.\r\n\r\nWe answer the second question propounded as follows:—\r\n\r\nBy the fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States it is\r\nprovided: *** \"Nor shall private property be taken for public use\r\nwithout just compensation.\" Would the taking of lands belonging to\r\ncitizens for the purpose of giving the same to Indians be such a public\r\nuse as is contemplated by the Constitution? We are of the opinion it\r\nwould not.

The village\r\nis within the boundaries of a Mexican grant, patented to the heirs of J.\r\nEstudillo, January 17th, 1880. The greater part of the grant has been\r\nsold to a company which, in dividing up its lands, allotted the tract\r\nwhere the Saboba village lies to one M. R. Byrnes, of San Bernardino,\r\nwho proposes to eject the Indians unless the United States Government\r\nwill buy his whole tract of seven hundred acres at an exorbitant price.\r\nThe Saboba village occupies about two hundred acres, the best part of\r\nMr. Byrnes's tract. The Indians have lived in the place for over a\r\nhundred years. They have adobe houses, fenced fields and orchards, and\r\nirrigating ditches. There is in the village a never-failing spring, with\r\na flow of about twenty-five miner's inches. It is claimed by the Indians\r\nthat the first surveys did not take in their village. This is probably\r\ntrue; the resurveying of grants and \"floating\" their lines so as to take\r\nin lands newly discovered to be of value, and leave out others\r\ndiscovered to be worthless, being a common practice in California. In a\r\ncountry where water is gold, such a spring as these Saboba Indians owned\r\ncould not long escape notice or be left long in the undisturbed\r\npossession of Indians. These Indians support themselves now, and have\r\nalways done so, by farming, and by going out in organized bands as\r\nsheep-shearers and vintagers. They are industrious and peaceable, and\r\nmake in good seasons a fairly comfortable living. They formerly kept\r\nstock, but since the new occupancy, allotting and fencing of the valley,\r\nhave been obliged to give it up. There is a Government school in this\r\nvillage, numbering from thirty to forty pupils, who have made remarkable\r\nprogress in their studies. The school is taught by a Pennsylvania lady,\r\nformerly a teacher of the freedmen. Her gentleness and refinement have\r\nexerted an influence all through the village, and her self-denying\r\nlabors among the people in times of sickness and suffering have been the\r\nwork of a missionary rather than of a teacher. The following letters\r\nwere written by two of the children in this school, both under fourteen\r\nyears of age. They were written without the teacher's knowledge or aid,\r\nand brought to her with the request that she would send them. The\r\nhandwritings are clear and good:—\r\n\r\n_To the President of the United States_:\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT: DEAR SIR,—I wish to write a letter for you, and I will\r\ntry to tell you some things. The white people call San Jacinto rancho\r\ntheir land, and I don't want them to do it. We think it is ours, for God\r\ngave it to us first. Now I think you will tell me what is right, for you\r\nhave been so good to us, giving us a school and helping us. Will you not\r\ncome to San Jacinto some time to see us, the school, and the people of\r\nSaboba village? Many of the people are sick, and some have died. We are\r\nso poor that we have not enough good food for the sick, and sometimes I\r\nam afraid that we are all going to die. Will you please tell what is\r\ngood about our ranches, and come soon to see us?\r\n\r\n                              Your friend,\r\n\r\n                                                           RAMON CAVAVI.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Jackson_:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,—I wish to write you a letter about the American people\r\nthat want to drive us away from our own village of Saboba. I don't know\r\nwhat they can be about. I don't know why they do so. My teacher told me\r\nshe was very sorry about the town, and then my teacher said, I think\r\nthey will find a good place for you if you have to go; but I do hope\r\nthey will not drive you away. Then it will be very good for all the\r\npeople of Saboba. It is a very good town for the people. They have all\r\nthe work done on their gardens, and they are very sorry about the work\r\nthat is done. My work is very nicely done also. The people are making\r\none big fence to keep the cows and the horses off their garden.\r\n\r\n                           Your true friend,\r\n\r\n                                                           ANTONIO LEON.\r\n\r\nThese Saboba Indians are greatly dispirited and disheartened at the\r\nprospect of being driven out of their homes, and feel that the\r\nGovernment ought to protect them. The captain of the village, a very\r\nsensible and clear-headed man, said, \"If the Government says we must go,\r\nwe must; but we would rather die right here than move.\" The right of\r\nthese Indians to the tract they have so long occupied and cultivated is\r\nbeyond question. That this right could be successfully maintained in the\r\ncourts is the opinion of the law firm of Brunson & Wells, whose\r\nadmirable paper covering all cases of this kind is given herewith. (See\r\nexhibit.)\r\n\r\nWe found three miles from this village on Government land a narrow cañon\r\ncalled Indian Cañon, in which half a dozen Indian families were living.\r\nThe cañon is but five or six miles long and very narrow; but it has a\r\nsmall, never-failing brook in it, and some good bottom land, on which\r\nthe Indians had excellent wheat crops growing. The sides of it are\r\nmoderately well wooded. It was surprising that so desirable a nook had\r\nbeen overlooked or omitted by the surveyors of the San Jacinto Ranch. We\r\nwrote to the Department immediately, recommending its being set aside\r\nfor Indians' use. In another beautiful cañon, also with a never-failing\r\nstream running through it, we found living the old chief, Victoriano,\r\nnearly one hundred years old. The spot was an oasis of green, oak and\r\nwillow trees, a wheat field, and apricot orchard and vineyard, the\r\nlatter planted by Victoriano's father. This place has been given by\r\nVictoriano to his grandson, who we were told is taking steps to secure\r\nit to himself under the Indian Homestead Act.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT C.\r\n\r\nTHE CAHUILLA RESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Cahuilla Valley is about forty miles from Saboba, high up among the\r\npeaks and spurs of the San Jacinto Mountains; a wild, barren,\r\ninaccessible spot. The Cahuilla village, situated here, was one of the\r\nmost interesting that we visited, and the Indians seemed a clear-headed,\r\nmore individual and independent people than any other we saw. This is\r\npartly due to their native qualities, the tribe having been originally\r\none of the most warlike and powerful in the country, as is indicated by\r\ntheir name, which signifies \"master.\" The isolation of this village has\r\nalso tended to keep these Indians self-respecting and independent. There\r\nis no white settlement within ten miles, there being comparatively\r\nlittle to tempt white men into these mountain-fastnesses. The population\r\nof the village numbers from one hundred and fifty to two hundred. The\r\nhouses are of adobe, thatched with reeds; three of the houses have\r\nshingled roofs, and one has the luxury of a floor. These Indians make\r\nthe greater part of their living by stock-raising. They also send out a\r\nsheep-shearing band each year. They have sixteen fields, large and\r\nsmall, under cultivation, and said they would have had many more except\r\nfor the lack of ploughs, there being but one plough for the whole\r\nvillage. They raise wheat, barley, corn, squashes, and watermelons.\r\nSometimes the frost kills the corn, and occasionally the grasshoppers\r\ndescend on the valley, but aside from these accidents their crops do\r\nwell. All through the village were to be seen their curious outdoor\r\ngranaries—huge baskets made of twisted and woven twigs and set up on\r\npoles. The women were neatly dressed, the children especially so, and\r\nthe faces of all, men, women, and children, had an animation and look of\r\nintellectual keenness very uncommon among the Southern California\r\nIndians. On the outskirts of the village is a never-failing hot spring.\r\nIn this water the Indians, old and young, are said to be continually\r\nbathing. It was the Indians' impression that the lines of their\r\nreservation ran directly through the centre of this hot spring. They had\r\nbeen told so by some white men, but they know nothing certainly. The\r\nlines had never been shown to them. On subsequent examination at the\r\nsurveyor-general's office in San Francisco we discovered that this\r\nspring and the village itself are entirely outside the reservation\r\nlines; also that another Indian settlement called Duasno, a few miles\r\ndistant, and intended to have been included in the reservation, is\r\noutside the lines. The Cahuilla Reservation stands recorded as\r\ncontaining twenty-six sections of land; so far as we could judge of the\r\nregion, it seemed to us a generous estimate to say that there might be\r\npossibly five hundred acres of cultivatable land in it. In good years\r\nthere would be considerable pasturage on the sides of the mountains; but\r\nfar the greater part of the tract is absolutely worthless, being bare\r\nand stony mountains. The Cahuillas, however, are satisfied with it. They\r\nlove the country, and would not exchange it for fertile valleys below.\r\nThey said that they would be perfectly contented if the Government would\r\nonly mark their land off for them, and set up boundaries so that they\r\ncould know where they might keep their own stock and keep the white\r\nmen's stock out. All they asked for in addition to this was some\r\nharnesses, wagons, and agricultural implements, especially ploughs. Of\r\nthese last the captain reiterated, and was not satisfied till he saw the\r\nfigures written down, that ten was the smallest number that would be\r\nsufficient for the village.\r\n\r\nA few rods from the hot spring there stood a good adobe house, shut up,\r\nunoccupied. The history of this house is worth telling, as an\r\nillustration of the sort of troubles to which Indians in these remote\r\nregions, unprotected by the Government, and unable to protect\r\nthemselves, are exposed. Some eight years ago the Cahuillas rented a\r\ntract of their land as pasture to two Mexicans named Machado. These\r\nMachados, by permission of the Indians, built this adobe house, and\r\nlived in it when looking after their stock. At the expiration of the\r\nlease the house was to be the property of the Indians. When the Machados\r\nleft they said to the Cahuilla captain, \"Here is your house.\" The next\r\nyear another man named Thomas rented a pasture tract from the Indians\r\nand also rented this house, paying for the use of it for two years six\r\nbulls, and putting into it a man named Cushman, who was his overseer. At\r\nthe end of the two years Thomas said to the Cahuillas, \"Here is your\r\nhouse; I now take my cattle away.\" But the man Cushman refused to move\r\nout of the house; said it was on railroad land which he had bought of\r\nthe railroad company. In spite of the Indians' remonstrances he lived on\r\nthere for three or four years. Finally he died. After his death his old\r\nemployer, Thomas, who had once rented this very house from the Indians,\r\ncame forward, claimed it as his own, and has now sold it to a man named\r\nParks. Through all this time the Indians committed no violence on the\r\ntrespassers. They journeyed to Los Angeles to find out from the railroad\r\ncompany whether Cushman owned the land as he said, and were told that he\r\ndid not. They laid the matter before their agent, but he was unable to\r\ndo anything about it. It would seem of the greatest importance in the\r\ncase of this reservation, and of all others similarly placed, that the\r\nodd section claimed or owned by the railroad companies should be secured\r\nand added to the permanent reservation. Much further trouble will in\r\nthis way be saved.\r\n\r\nAn incident which had occurred on the boundaries of the Cahuilla\r\nReservation a few weeks before our arrival there is of importance as an\r\nillustration of the need of some legal protection for the Indians in\r\nSouthern California. A Cahuilla Indian named Juan Diego had built for\r\nhimself a house and cultivated a small patch of ground on a high\r\nmountain ledge a few miles north of the village. Here he lived alone\r\nwith his wife and baby. He had been for some years what the Indians call\r\na \"locoed\" Indian, being at times crazy; never dangerous, but yet\r\ncertainly insane for longer or shorter periods. His condition was known\r\nto the agent, who told us that he had feared he would be obliged to shut\r\nJuan up if he did not get better. It was also well known throughout the\r\nneighboring country, as we found on repeated inquiry. Everybody knew\r\nthat Juan Diego was \"locoed.\" (This expression comes from the effect a\r\nweed of that name has upon horses, making them wild and unmanageable.)\r\nJuan Diego had been off to find work at sheep-shearing. He came home at\r\nnight riding a strange horse. His wife exclaimed, \"Why, whose horse is\r\nthat?\" Juan looked at the horse, and replied confusedly, \"Where is my\r\nhorse, then?\" The woman, much frightened, said, \"You must take that\r\nhorse right back; they will say you stole it.\" Juan replied that he\r\nwould as soon as he had rested; threw himself down and fell asleep. From\r\nthis sleep he was awakened by the barking of the dogs, and ran out of\r\nthe house to see what it meant. The woman followed, and was the only\r\nwitness of what then occurred. A white man, named Temple, the owner of\r\nthe horse which Juan had ridden home, rode up, and on seeing Juan poured\r\nout a volley of oaths, levelled his gun and shot him dead. After Juan\r\nhad fallen on the ground Temple rode closer and fired three more shots\r\nin the body, one in the forehead, one in the cheek, and one in the\r\nwrist, the woman looking on. He then took his horse, which was standing\r\ntied in front of the house, and rode away. The woman, with her baby on\r\nher back, ran to the Cahuilla village and told what had happened. This\r\nwas in the night. At dawn the Indians went over to the place, brought\r\nthe murdered man's body to the village, and buried it. The excitement\r\nwas intense. The teacher, in giving us an account of the affair, said\r\nthat for a few days she feared she would be obliged to close her school\r\nand leave the village. The murderer went to the nearest justice of the\r\npeace and gave himself up, saying that he had in self-defence shot an\r\nIndian. He swore that the Indian ran towards him with a knife. A jury of\r\ntwelve men was summoned, who visited the spot, listened to Temple's\r\nstory, pronounced him guiltless, and the judge so decided. The woman's\r\ntestimony was not taken. It would have been worthless if it had been, so\r\nfar as influencing that jury's minds was concerned. Her statement was\r\npositive that Juan had no knife, nor weapon of any kind; sprang up from\r\nhis sleep and ran out hastily to see what had happened, and was shot\r\nalmost as soon as he had crossed the threshold of the door. The district\r\nattorney in San Diego, on being informed by us of the facts in the case,\r\nreluctantly admitted that there would be no use whatever in bringing a\r\nwhite man to trial for murder of an Indian under such circumstances,\r\nwith only Indian testimony to convict him. This was corroborated, and\r\nthe general animus of public feeling vividly illustrated to us by a\r\nconversation we had later with one of the jurors in the case, a fine,\r\nopen-hearted, manly young fellow, far superior in education and social\r\nstanding to the average Southern California ranchman. He not only\r\njustified Temple's killing the Indian, but said he would have done the\r\nsame thing himself. \"I don't care whether the Indian had a knife or\r\nnot,\" he said; \"that didn't cut any figure at all the way I looked at\r\nit. Any man that'd take a horse of mine and ride him up that mountain\r\ntrail, I'd shoot him whenever I found him. Stockmen have just got to\r\nprotect themselves in this country.\" The fact that Juan had left his own\r\nhorse, a well-known one, in the corral from which he had taken Temple's;\r\nthat he had ridden the straight trail to his own door, and left the\r\nhorse tied in front of it, thus making it certain that he would be\r\ntracked and caught, weighed nothing in this young man's mind. The utmost\r\nconcession that he would make was finally to say, \"Well, I'll agree that\r\nTemple was to blame for firin' into him after he was dead. That was\r\nmean, I'll allow.\"\r\n\r\nThe account of our visit to the Cahuilla Reservation would be incomplete\r\nwithout a brief description of the school there. It numbers from forty\r\nto fifty scholars, and is taught by a widow who, with her little\r\ndaughter ten years of age, lives in one small room built on at the end\r\nof the school-house. Part of the room is curtained off into a recess\r\nholding bed, washstand, and bureau. The rest of the room is a\r\nsitting-room, kitchen, store-room, and barely holds the cooking-stove,\r\ntable, and chairs. Here alone, with her little daughter, in a village of\r\nnear two hundred Indians, ten miles from any white man's home, this\r\nbrave woman has lived more than a year, doing a work of which the hours\r\nspent in the school-room are the smallest part. The Indians come to her\r\nwith every perplexity and trouble; call on her for nursing when they are\r\nill, for food when they are destitute. If she would allow it her little\r\nroom could always be crowded with women, and men also, eager to watch\r\nand learn. The Cahuillas have good brains, are keen, quick, and\r\npersevering. The progress that these children have made in the\r\ncomparatively short time since their school was opened was far beyond\r\nthat ordinarily made by white children in the same length of time.\r\nChildren who two years ago did not know a letter, read intelligently in\r\nthe second and third readers, spelled promptly and with remarkable\r\naccuracy, and wrote clear and legible hands, their copy-books being\r\nabsolutely free from blots or erasures; some of the older pupils went\r\ncreditably through a mental arithmetic examination, in which the\r\nquestions were by no means easy to follow. They sang songs in fair tune\r\nand time, and with great spirit, evidently enjoying this part of the\r\nexercises more than all the rest. We had carried to them a parcel of\r\nillustrated story-books, very kindly contributed by some of the leading\r\npublishers in New York and Boston, and the expression of the rows of\r\nbright dark eyes as the teacher held up book after book was long to be\r\nremembered. The strain on the nervous system of teachers in such\r\npositions as this can hardly be estimated by ordinary standards. The\r\nabsolute isolation, the ceaseless demand, the lack, not only of the\r\ncomforts, but of many of the necessities of life, all mount up into a\r\nburden which it would seem no woman could long endure. Last winter there\r\nwas a snow-storm in the Cahuilla Valley lasting two days and nights. A\r\nfierce wind drove the dry snow in at every crevice of the poorly built\r\nadobe house, like sand in a sand-storm. The first day of the storm the\r\nschool had to be closed early in the day, as the snow fell so fast on\r\nbooks and slates nothing could be done. The last night of the storm the\r\nteacher and her little girl spent the entire night in shovelling snow\r\nout of the room. They would pile it in a blanket, open the door, empty\r\nthe blanket, and then resume shovelling. They worked hard all night to\r\nkeep pace with the storm. When the snowing stopped the school-room was\r\ndrifted full, and for many days after was wet and damp. It would seem as\r\nif the school term in such places as this ought not to be over eight\r\nmonths in the year. The salaries, however, should not be reduced, for\r\nthey are barely living salaries now, every necessary of life being\r\nprocured at a great disadvantage in these wild regions. One of these\r\nteachers told us she had been obliged to give an Indian $1 to ride to\r\nthe nearest store and bring her one dollar's worth of sugar. It was the\r\nopinion of the Cahuilla teacher (a teacher of experience at the East\r\nbefore her marriage) that the Indians would accomplish more in eight\r\nmonths than in the nine. The strain upon them also is too great—of the\r\nunwonted confinement and continuous brain work. Should this change be\r\nmade the vacation should be so arranged as to be taken at the\r\nsheep-shearing season, at which times all the schools are much broken up\r\nby the absence of the elder boys.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT D.\r\n\r\nTHE WARNER'S RANCH INDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe tract known as Warner's Ranch lies in the northern part of San Diego\r\nCounty, about forty miles from the Cahuilla Valley. It contains two\r\ngrants, the San José del Valle and the Valle de San José; the first\r\ncontaining between 26,000 and 27,000 acres, confirmed to J. J. Warner,\r\npatented January 16th, 1880; the second, containing between 17,000 and\r\n18,000 acres, confirmed to one Portilla, patented January 10th, 1880.\r\nThe whole property is now in the possession of Governor Downey, of Los\r\nAngeles. There are said to be several conflicting claims yet unsettled.\r\nThe ranch is now used as a sheep and stock ranch, and is of great value.\r\nIt is a beautiful region, well watered and wooded. There are within its\r\nboundaries five Indian villages, of San Luisenos and Diegmons—Aqua\r\nCaliente, Puerta de la Cruz, Puerta de San José, San José, and Mataguay.\r\nThe last four are very small, but Aqua Caliente has long been the most\r\nflourishing and influential village in the country. It was formerly set\r\napart as a reservation, but the executive order was cancelled January\r\n17th, 1880, immediately after the patenting of the San José del Valle\r\nRanch, within the boundaries of which it was then claimed that the\r\nvillage lay, although to the best information we could get the first\r\nthree surveys of that ranch did not take the village in. The aged\r\ncaptain of the Aqua Caliente Indians still preserves a paper giving a\r\nmemorandum of the setting off of this reservation of about 1,120 acres\r\nfor this people. It was by executive order, 1875. He also treasures\r\nseveral other equally worthless papers—a certificate from a San Diego\r\njudge that the Indians are entitled to their lands; a memorandum of a\r\npromise from General Kearney, who assured them that in consideration of\r\ntheir friendliness and assistance to him they should retain their homes\r\nwithout molestation, \"although the whole State should fill with white\r\nmen.\" It is not to be wondered at that these Aqua Caliente Indians find\r\nit difficult to-day to put any faith in white men's promises.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above brief statement of the situation that\r\nthey have an exceedingly strong claim on the Government for protection\r\nin their right to their lands. Since the restoration of their village\r\nand fields \"to the public domain,\" the patenting of the ranches and\r\ntheir sale to Governor Downey, the Indians have been in constant anxiety\r\nand terror. Governor Downey has been considerate and humane in his\r\ncourse toward them, and toward all the Indians on his estate. And his\r\nsuperintendent also is friendly in his treatment of them, permitting\r\nthem all the liberty he can consistently with his duty to the ranch. He\r\nfinds their labor invaluable at sheep-shearing time, and is able\r\nthroughout the year to give them occasional employment. But the Indians\r\nknow very well that according to the usual course of things in San Diego\r\nCounty they are liable any day to be ejected by process of law; and it\r\nis astonishing that under the circumstances they have so persevered in\r\ntheir industries of one sort and another. They have a good number of\r\nfields under cultivation. They also make saddle mats and hats out of\r\nfibrous plants; the women make baskets and lace. It is said to be the\r\nmost industrious village in the county; the old captain dealing severely\r\nwith any Indian found idle. They have also a small revenue from the hot\r\nsprings, from which the village takes its name. These bubble up in a\r\nsuccession of curious stone basins in the heart of the village. They are\r\nmuch resorted to in summer by rheumatic and other patients, who rent the\r\nIndians' little adobe houses and pay them a small tax for the use of the\r\nwaters. The Indians themselves at these times move into bush huts in a\r\nvalley or cañon some two miles above the village, where their chief\r\ncultivated fields lie. They were very earnest to know from us if we\r\nwould advise their planting more of this ground. They said they would\r\nhave planted it all except that they were afraid of being driven away.\r\nThis upper valley and these planting fields were said to be on\r\nGovernment land; but on examination of the surveyor's plats in the Los\r\nAngeles land office, we could find no field notes to indicate their\r\nlocation. These Indians have in use another valley called Lost Valley,\r\nsome fifteen miles from their village high up in the mountains, and\r\nreached only by one very steep trail. Here they keep their stock, being\r\nno longer able to pasture it below. They were touchingly anxious to have\r\nus write down the numbers of cattle, horses, sheep, each man had, and\r\nreport to Washington, that the President might see how they were all\r\ntrying to work. There are probably from one hundred and twenty-five to\r\none hundred and fifty head of cattle owned in the village, about fifty\r\nhorses, and one hundred sheep.\r\n\r\nThere is here a Government school, taught by a young German lady of\r\nexcellent education and much enthusiasm in her work. At great cost and\r\nrisk she has carried her piano up into these wilds, and finds it an\r\ninvaluable assistance in training and influencing her pupils. It was a\r\nscene not to be forgotten, when after their exercises in reading,\r\narithmetic, &c., in all of which they showed a really wonderful\r\nproficiency, the children crowded into the teacher's little room and\r\nsang their songs to the piano accompaniment, played by her with spirit\r\nand feeling. \"My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty,\" was the\r\nsong they seemed to like best; all unaware how little applicable to\r\ntheir own situation were its strains of exultant joy and freedom. In\r\nthis one tiny room adjoining the school-room this young lady lives,\r\nsleeps, prepares her own food, frequently having a \"cooking class\" of\r\nIndian women, whom she is teaching to make soups, bread, &c., and to do\r\nfine washing. It is impossible to put too much appreciative sympathy on\r\nthese women teachers in Indian schools in Southern California. Their\r\nsituation and their work are unique in isolation and difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe other Indian villages on Warner's Ranch do not demand separate\r\ndescription, consisting of not more than half a dozen houses each, and\r\nnumbering only from fifteen to thirty Indians. Each village, however,\r\nhas its own captain, and its cultivated fields, orchards, &c., to which\r\nthe Indians are profoundly attached, and from which it would be very\r\nhard to induce them to move, spite of their poverty, and the difficulty\r\nof making a living, as they are now placed.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Warner's Ranch, the captain of the San José village\r\nhad an experience which will illustrate the helplessness of these Indian\r\nfarmers in Southern California. He had on a piece of Government land, a\r\nshort distance from his village, a fenced wheat-field of some fifty\r\nacres; it was his chief dependence for his year's support. Going away\r\none day, he left his aged father in charge at home; the old man wandered\r\naway, and during his absence one of the roving sheep-herders, of whom\r\nthe country is full, broke down the fence, turned in his flock, and when\r\nDomingo came home at night the whole field was eaten close to the\r\nground. Hearing of our being at the superintendent's house, Domingo came\r\nover to ask if we could help him in the matter. The quiet,\r\nmatter-of-course way in which he told the story was more impressive than\r\nany loudness of complaint would have been. He said very simply, \"What\r\ncan I do for food this winter?\" Mr. Kinney rode over to the village, saw\r\nthe field, and after some trouble found the herder, who, much\r\nfrightened, said he did it by his master's orders. This master, an\r\nItalian, lived some twenty miles away; the nearest justice of the peace,\r\nsixteen miles. On seeing the justice we found that nothing could be done\r\nin the way of securing damages from the sheep-owner until two white men,\r\nresidents of the county, should inspect the premises and estimate the\r\ndamages. Domingo rode sixteen miles in the night in a fierce storm of\r\nsleet and rain, with letters from us to white men on the ranch, asking\r\nthem to do this. He was back again at daylight with a note from one of\r\nthem, saying that he could not induce a man to go with him. Finally, the\r\njustice, at our request, hired two men at days' wages to go and inspect\r\nthe Indian's field. They estimated the damages at about one-tenth of the\r\nreal amount, and thus we were obliged to leave the matter. We afterwards\r\nreceived a letter from the Italian stating that he had settled with\r\nDomingo, but not mentioning the sum paid. It was plain that except for\r\nour taking hold of the affair the Indian would never have recovered a\r\ncent. This is by no means an exceptional instance.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT E.\r\n\r\nTHE SAN YSIDRO INDIANS.\r\n\r\nIn the San Ysidro Cañon, about eight miles from Warner's Ranch, has been\r\nliving from time immemorial a band of San Luiseno Indians, numbering\r\nfrom fifty to seventy-five, and called by the name of their cañon. We\r\nfirst saw the captain of these Indians in Los Angeles, in the office of\r\nthe United States Court Commissioner, Mr. H. T. Lee, of whose kindness\r\nand humane sympathy in dealing with all Indian matters which come under\r\nhis notice it is not out of place here to make grateful mention. This\r\nCaptain Pablo, with two of his head men, had walked a three days'\r\njourney to Los Angeles to see if he could get any help in the matter of\r\nlands which had been wrested from his people. His story was a pitiful\r\none. Some six years ago a white man named Chatham Helm had come in at\r\nthe head of their cañon, three miles above the site of their village,\r\ntaken up a homestead claim there, cutting off the greater part of their\r\nwater supply, and taking some of their cultivated fields, and leaving\r\nthem restricted room for their stock. Since that time they had been\r\ngrowing poorer and poorer, but had managed to live by cultivating lands\r\nbelow the village near the mouth of the cañon, where there was another\r\nsmall stream. But now a new squatter had appeared below them, and filed\r\non all the remaining lands, including the site of the village itself.\r\nThe man Helm, above them, had patented his lands, built a good house,\r\nand was keeping considerable stock. The Indians could have no water\r\nexcept what he permitted to come down the cañon. Three years ago one of\r\ntheir number had been shot dead by Helm, who was set free on the usual\r\nplea of self-defence. Since then the Indians had been in continual\r\nterror. The new squatter had threatened them with the same fate if they\r\ncame near his enclosures. Between these two squatters the Indian village\r\nwas completely hemmed in and cut off, and starvation stared them in the\r\nface. In fact, in the course of the last winter one little girl had\r\nactually died for want of food. Their countenances corroborated the\r\ntale. They were gaunt with hunger and full of despair. It would exceed\r\nthe limits of this paper to give a full report of the interview with\r\nthese Indians. It will not soon be forgotten by any one taking part in\r\nit,—the solemn tones in which the Indians replied to the interpreter's\r\nquestions, the intent and imploring gaze with which they studied all our\r\nfaces and listened to all the words unintelligible to them in which we\r\nspoke with one another.\r\n\r\nIt was finally decided to forward to the Interior Department the\r\naffidavits of these Indians, setting forth the manner in which they had\r\nbeen robbed of their lands, and requesting that Cloos's entry be held\r\nfor cancellation, and that Helm's patent be reopened. It was found, on\r\nlooking the matter up in Washington, that several years ago this cañon\r\nhad been withdrawn from market with a view to having it set off as a\r\nreservation for the Indians living in it, but the matter had slipped\r\neverybody's mind. On visiting the San Ysidro Cañon ourselves a few weeks\r\nlater, we found that Cloos, taking time by the forelock, had sold out\r\nhis homestead claim, his house, and what he was pleased to call his\r\n\"improvements,\" for $600 to a poor old widow, Mrs. Pamela Hagar by name.\r\nWe found Mrs. Hagar, with her son, on the ground, preparing to go into\r\nthe bee business. She appeared very little surprised at hearing that the\r\nclaim she had bought was a questionable one, remarking: \"Well, I\r\nmistrusted something was wrong; Cloos seemed in such a hurry to get his\r\nmoney.\" This woman appeared nearly as helpless as the Indians\r\nthemselves. The deed she had taken from Cloos was not acknowledged; she\r\nhad not got it recorded; her name was misspelled in it; and the\r\nenumeration of the sections, &c., in it did not agree with the list in\r\nthe land office certificate. She begged us to ask the Government to\r\nrefund to her the sum she had paid to Cloos, and signed by her mark a\r\npaper saying she would accept it. It is a small sum, and as the poor old\r\nwoman made the transaction in good faith, knowing nothing about the\r\nIndians' presence on the place, it would seem not unreasonable that she\r\nshould be paid. The next morning Cloos himself appeared on the scene,\r\nvery angry and resentful. He said he had \"a perfect right to file on\r\nthat land;\" that \"Indians were not citizens\" and \"had no right to public\r\nlands,\" and that \"the stockmen of San Diego County were not going to\r\nstand the Indians' killing their stock much longer;\" that \"the\r\nGovernment ought to put the Indians all together somewhere and take care\r\nof them,\" and that \"there'd be a big fight with Indians in San Diego\r\nCounty before long, we might rest assured of that;\" and much more of the\r\nsame sort, which would not be worth repeating, except that it is a good\r\nillustration of the animus of the greater portion of Southern California\r\nranchmen towards Indians. A few days after this we were gladdened by the\r\nnews from Washington that Cloos's filing was held for cancellation, and\r\nthat the Attorney-General had ordered proceedings to be begun in San\r\nFrancisco for the vacating of Chatham Helm's patent. A few instances of\r\nsuch promptitude as this would change the whole status of the South\r\nCalifornia Indians, giving courage to them, and, what is still more\r\nimportant, making it clear to the perception of white men that the\r\nIndians' rights are no longer to be disregarded as they have been.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT F.\r\n\r\nTHE LOS COYOTES.\r\n\r\nFive miles up from the head of the San Ysidro Cañon, to be reached only\r\nby a steep and narrow trail, lies a small valley on the desert side of\r\nthe mountains. It is little more than a pocket on a ledge. From its rim\r\none looks down directly into the desert. Few white men have ever\r\npenetrated to it, and the Indians occupying it have been hitherto safe,\r\nby reason of the poverty and inaccessibility of their home. No agent has\r\never visited them; they have supported themselves by keeping stock and\r\ncultivating their few acres of land. There are not more than eighty\r\nacres all told in the valley. About three weeks before our arrival at\r\nWarner's Ranch a man named Jim Fane, a comrade of Helm, who had usurped\r\nthe San Ysidro Cañon, having, no doubt, learned through Helm of the\r\nexistence of the Los Coyotes Valley, appeared in the village and offered\r\nthe Indians $200 for their place. They refused to sell, upon which he\r\ntold them that he had filed on the land, should stay in any event, and\r\nproceeded to cut down trees and build a corral. It seems a marvellous\r\nforbearance on the part of a community numbering twenty-six able-bodied\r\nmen and twenty-one women not to take any forcible measures to repel such\r\nan intruder as this. But the South California Indians have learned by\r\nlong experience that in any contest with white men they are sure to be\r\nfound in the wrong. Not an Indian laid violent hands on Fane. He seems\r\nto have gone about as safely in the heart of this Indian village, which\r\nhe was avowedly making ready to steal, as if he had been in an empty\r\nwilderness. Mr. Kinney found him there, hard at work, his belt full of\r\ncartridges and pistols. He was a rough fellow, at first disposed to be\r\ndefiant and blustering, but on being informed of the Department's action\r\nin the case of Cloos's filing, he took a milder tone, and signed a paper\r\nsaying that he would take $75 for his \"improvements.\" Later in the day,\r\nafter consulting with his friend Helm, he withdrew the paper and\r\nannounced his determination to stay in the valley. On inquiry at the\r\nland office at Los Angeles we found that his filing had been returned to\r\nhim for correction of errors. We were therefore in time to secure the\r\nstopping of all further proceedings on his part through the land office.\r\nNothing, however, but authorized and authoritative action on the part of\r\nthe agent representing the Interior Department will stop his proceedings\r\non the ground. Just before leaving California we received an urgent\r\nletter from the Los Coyotes' captain, saying that Fane was still\r\nthere—still cutting down their trees and building corrals.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of this band are robust, active, and finely made, more\r\nnearly in the native health and strength of the race than any other band\r\nin the country. The large proportion of children also bore testimony to\r\ntheir healthful condition, there being thirty-five children to\r\ntwenty-one women and twenty-six men. The captain had the lists of his\r\npeople kept by three lines of notches on a stick, a new notch being made\r\nfor each birth and crossed out for each death. They could count only up\r\nto five. Everything beyond that was \"many.\" Their houses were good,\r\nbuilt of hewn pine timber with thatched roofs made from some tough\r\nfibrous plant, probably the yucca. Each house had a thatched bower in\r\nfront of it and stood in a fenced enclosure. These Indians raise beans,\r\npumpkins, wheat, barley, and corn. They have twenty-five head of cattle\r\nand more horses. They say they have lived in this valley always, and\r\nnever desire to leave it. The only things they asked for were a harness,\r\nchain, coulter, and five ploughs. They have now one plough.\r\n\r\nThis village is one of the best illustrations of our remarks on the need\r\nof itinerary labor among the Mission Indians. Here is a village of\r\neighty-four souls living in a mountain fastness which they so love they\r\nwould rather die than leave it, but where the ordinary agencies and\r\ninfluences of civilization will never reach, no matter how thickly\r\nsettled the regions below may come. A fervent religious and practical\r\nteacher spending a few weeks each year among these Indians might sow\r\nseed that would never cease growing during the intervals of his absence.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT G.\r\n\r\nTHE SANTA YSABEL RANCH.\r\n\r\nThe Santa Ysabel Ranch is adjoining to Warner's Ranch. It is a\r\nwell-wooded, well-watered, beautiful country, much broken by steep and\r\nstony mountains. The original grant of this ranch was confirmed March\r\n17th, 1858, to one José Ortego and the heirs of Edward Stokes. The\r\npatent was issued May 14th, 1872. It is now owned by a Captain Wilcox,\r\nwho has thus far not only left undisturbed the Indian village within the\r\nboundaries of his estate, but has endeavored to protect the Indians by\r\nallowing to the ranch lessee a rebate of $200 yearly on the rent on\r\naccount of the Indians' occupancy. There is in the original grant of\r\nthis ranch the following clause: \"The grantees will leave free and\r\nundisturbed the agricultural lands which the Indians of San Diego are\r\nactually occupying.\"\r\n\r\nWe found on arriving at the Santa Ysabel village that an intelligent\r\nyoung Indian living there had recently been elected as general over the\r\nDieguino Indians in the neighborhood. He showed to us his papers and\r\nbegged us to wait till he could have all his captains gathered to meet\r\nus. Eight villages he reported as being under his control,—Santa Ysabel,\r\nMesa Grande, Mesa Chilquita, San José, Mataguay, La Puerta, Laguna, and\r\nAnaha. He was full of interest and inquiry and enthusiasm about his\r\npeople. \"I want know American way,\" he said in his broken English. \"I\r\nwant make all my people like American people. How I find out American\r\nlaws? When white men lose cow, lose pig, they come here with pistol and\r\nsay we must find or give up man that stole. How we know? Is that\r\nAmerican law? We all alone out here. We got nobody show us. Heap things\r\nI want ask about. I make all my people work. We can't work like American\r\npeople; we ain't got work with; we ain't got wagon, harness; three old\r\nbroked ploughs for all these people. What we want, some man right here\r\nto go to. While you here white man very good; when you go away trouble\r\nsame as before.\"\r\n\r\nThere are one hundred and seventy-one Indians in this village. They are\r\nvery poor. Many of their houses are of tule or brush, their clothes were\r\nscanty and ragged, some of the older men wearing but a single garment.\r\nThat they had not been idle their big wheat-field proved; between three\r\nand four hundred acres fenced and the wheat well up. \"How do you divide\r\nthe crops?\" we asked. \"Every man knows his own piece,\" was the reply.\r\nThey sell all of this wheat that they can spare to a storekeeper some\r\nthree miles away. Having no wagon they draw the wheat there on a sort of\r\nsledge or wood triangle, about four feet long, with slats across it. A\r\nrope is tied to the apex of this, then fastened to the horn of a saddle\r\non a horse ridden by a man, who steers the sledge as best he may. The\r\nIndians brought this sledge to show us, to prove how sorely they needed\r\nwagons. They also made the women bring out all the children and arrange\r\nthem in rows, to show that they had enough for a school, repeating over\r\nand over that they had many more, but they were all out digging wild\r\nroots and vegetables. \"If there was not great many them, my people die\r\nhungry,\" said the general; \"them most what we got eat.\" It is a sore\r\ngrievance to these Santa Ysabel Indians that the Aqua Caliente Indians,\r\nonly twenty miles away, have received from the Government a school,\r\nploughs, wagons, &c., while nothing whatever has been done for them.\r\n\"Them Aqua Caliente Indians got everything,\" said the general; \"got hot\r\nsprings too; make money on them hot springs; my people got no chance\r\nmake money.\"\r\n\r\nOn the second day of our stay in this region we saw four of the young\r\ngeneral's captains, those of Puerta San Felipe, San José, Anaha, and\r\nLaguna. In Puerta San Felipe are sixty-four people. This village is on a\r\nconfirmed grant, the \"Valle de San Felipe,\" confirmed to Felipe\r\nCastillo. The ranch is now leased to a Frenchman, who is taking away the\r\nwater from the Indian village, and tells the captain that the whole\r\nvillage belongs to him, and that if anybody so much as hunts a rabbit on\r\nthe place he will put him in prison. These people are in great\r\ndestitution and trouble, being deprived of most of their previous means\r\nof support. The Anaha captain reported fifty-three people in his\r\nvillage. White men had come in and fenced up land on both sides of him.\r\n\"When he plants his wheat and grain the white men run their hogs into\r\nthe fields;\" and \"when the white men find anything dead they come to him\r\nto make him tell everything about it, and he has not got anything to\r\ntell.\" The San José captain had a similar story. The Laguna captain was\r\na tall, swarthy, well-to-do-looking Indian, so unlike all the rest that\r\nwe wondered what there could have been in his life to produce such a\r\ndifference. He said nobody troubled him. He had good land, plenty of\r\nwater, raised grain and vegetables, everything he wanted except\r\nwatermelons. His village contained eleven persons; was to be reached\r\nonly by a steep trail, the last four miles. We expressed our pleasure at\r\nfinding one Indian captain and village that were in no trouble and\r\nwanted for nothing. He smiled mysteriously, as we afterward recalled,\r\nand reiterated that nobody troubled him. The mystery was explained\r\nlater, when we discovered accidentally in San Diego that this Laguna\r\nvillage had not escaped, as we supposed, the inroads of white men, and\r\nthat the only reason that the Laguna Indians were not in trouble was\r\nthat they had peaceably surrendered half their lands to a white man, who\r\nwas living amicably among them under a sort of contract or lease.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT H.\r\n\r\nMESA GRANDE.\r\n\r\nMesa Grande lies high up above the Santa Ysabel village and fifteen\r\nmiles west of it. The tract adjoins the Santa Ysabel Ranch, and is, as\r\nits name indicates, a large table-land. There was set off here in 1876 a\r\nlarge reservation, intended to include the Mesa Grande Indian village,\r\nand also a smaller one of Mesa Chilquita; but, as usual, the villages\r\nwere outside of the lines, and the lands reserved were chiefly\r\nworthless. One of the settlers in the neighborhood told us he would not\r\ntake the whole reservation as a gift and pay the taxes on it. The\r\nsituation of the Indians here is exceedingly unfortunate and growing\r\nmore and more so daily. The good Mesa Grande lands, which they once\r\nowned and occupied, and which should have been secured to them, have\r\nbeen fast taken up by whites, the Indians driven off, and, as the young\r\ngeneral said, \"all bunched up till they haven't got any room.\" Both the\r\nMesa Chilquita and Mesa Grande plateaus are now well under cultivation\r\nby whites, who have good houses and large tracts fenced in.\r\n\r\nThey have built a good school-house, which we chanced to pass at the\r\nhour of recess, and noting Indian faces among the children, stopped to\r\ninquire about them. There were, out of twenty-seven scholars, fifteen\r\nIndians or half-breeds, some of them the children of Indians who had\r\ntaken up homesteads. We asked the teacher what was the relative\r\nbrightness of the Indian and white children. Supposing that we shared\r\nthe usual prejudice against Indians, the teacher answered in a\r\njudiciously deprecating tone, \"Well, really there isn't so much\r\ndifference between them as you would suppose.\" \"In favor of which race?\"\r\nwe asked. Thus suddenly enlightened as to our animus in the matter, the\r\nteacher changed his tone, and said he found the Indian children full as\r\nbright as the whites; in fact, the brightest scholar he had was a\r\nhalf-breed girl.\r\n\r\nOn the census list taken of Indians in 1880 Mesa Grande and Mesa\r\nChilquita are reported as having, the first one hundred and three\r\nIndians, the second twenty-three. There are probably not so many now,\r\nthe Mesa Chilquita tract being almost wholly in possession of the\r\nwhites. The Mesa Grande village has a beautiful site on a small stream,\r\nin a sort of hill basin, surrounded by higher hills. The houses are\r\nchiefly adobe, and there is on one of the slopes a neat little adobe\r\nchapel, with a shingled roof nearly done, of which the Indians were very\r\nproud. There were many fields of grain and a few fruit orchards. The\r\nwomen gathered around our carriage in eager groups, insisting on shaking\r\nhands, and holding up their little children to shake hands also. They\r\nhave but once seen an agent of the Government, and any evidence of real\r\ninterest in them and their welfare touches them deeply.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Indians in this district is too full of\r\ncomplications and troubles to be written out here in detail. A verbatim\r\ncopy of a few of our notes taken on the spot will give a good picture of\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nChrysanto, an Indian, put off his farm two months ago by white man named\r\nJim Angel, with certificate of homestead from Los Angeles land office.\r\nAntonio Douro, another, put off in same way from his farm near\r\nschool-house. He had built good wooden house; the white man took that\r\nand half his land. He was ploughing when the white man came and said,\r\n\"Get out! I have bought this land.\" They have been to the agent. They\r\nhave been ten times, till they are tired to go. Another American named\r\nHardy ran an Indian off his farm, built a house on it; then he sold it\r\nto Johnson, and Johnson took a little more land; and Johnson sold it to\r\nStone, and he took still more. They used to be well fixed, had plenty of\r\nstock and hundreds of horses. Now they are all penned up, and have had\r\nto pay such fines they have got poor. Whites take their horses and\r\ncattle and corral them and make them pay 25 cents, 50 cents to get them\r\nout. \"Is that American law?\" they asked; \"and if it is law for Indians'\r\nhorses, is it not same for white men's horses?\" But one Indian shut up\r\nsome of the white men's horses that came on his land, and the constable\r\ncame and took them all away and made the Indian pay money. The Americans\r\nso thick now they want all the Indians away; so, to make them go, they\r\nkeep accusing them of stealing.\r\n\r\nThis is a small tithe of what we were told. It was pitiful to see the\r\nhope die out of the Indians' faces as they laid grievance after\r\ngrievance before us, and we were obliged to tell them we could do\r\nnothing, except to \"tell the Government.\" On our way back to Santa\r\nYsabel we were waylaid by several Indians, some of them very aged, each\r\nwith the same story of having been driven off or being in imminent\r\ndanger of being driven off his lands.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we had a long interview with one of the white\r\nsettlers of Mesa Grande, and learned some particulars as to a\r\ncombination into which the Mesa Grande whites had entered to protect\r\nthemselves against cattle and horse thieves. The young Indian general\r\nwas present at this interview. His boots were toeless; he wore an old\r\ngingham shirt and ragged waistcoat, but his bearing was full of dignity.\r\nAccording to the white man's story, this combination was not a vigilance\r\ncommittee at all. It was called \"The Protective League of Mesa Grande,\"\r\nand had no special reference to Indians in any way. According to the\r\nIndian general's story it was a vigilance committee, and all the Indians\r\nknew very well that their lives were in danger from it. The white man\r\nprotested against this, and reiterated his former statements. To our\r\ninquiry why, if the league were for the mutual protection of all\r\ncattle-owners in the region, the captains of the Indian villages were\r\nnot invited to join it, he replied that he himself would have been in\r\nfavor of that, but that to the average white settler in the region such\r\na suggestion would be like a red rag to a bull; that he himself,\r\nhowever, was a warm friend to the Indians. \"How long you been friend to\r\nIndians?\" asked the boy-general, with quiet sarcasm. We afterwards\r\nlearned by inquiry of one of the most influential citizens of a\r\nneighboring town, that this protective league was in fact nothing more\r\nor less than a vigilance committee, and that it meant short shrift to\r\nIndians; but being betrayed by one of its members it had come to an\r\nuntimely end, to the great relief of all law-abiding people in the\r\nvicinity. He also added that the greater part of the cattle and horse\r\nstealing in the region was done by Mexicans and whites, not by Indians.\r\n\r\nWhether it is possible for the Government to put these Mesa Grande\r\nIndians into a position to protect themselves, and have anything like a\r\nfair chance to make their living in their present situation, is a\r\nquestion; but that it ought to be done, if possible, is beyond question.\r\nIt is grievous to think that this fine tract of land so long owned and\r\noccupied by these Indians, and in good faith intended by the Government\r\nto be set aside for their use, has thus passed into other hands. Even if\r\nthe reservation tract, some three hundred acres, has been by fraudulent\r\nrepresentations restored to the public domain, and now occupied by a man\r\nnamed Clelland, who has taken steps to patent it, the tract by proper\r\ninvestigation and action could probably be reclaimed for the Indians'\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT I.\r\n\r\nCAPITAN GRANDE.\r\n\r\nCapitan Grande is the name of the cañon through which the San Diego\r\nRiver comes down from the Cuyamaca Mountains, where it takes its rise.\r\nThe cañon is thirty-five miles from the city of San Diego; is fifteen\r\nmiles long, and has narrow bottom lands along the river, in some places\r\nwidening out into good meadows. It is in parts beautifully wooded and\r\nfull of luxuriant growths of shrubs and vines and flowering plants. In\r\n1853 a band of Dieguino Indians were, by the order of Lieutenant\r\nMagruder, moved from San Diego to this cañon (see Paper No. 1, appended\r\nhereto). These Indians have continued ever since to live there, although\r\nlatterly they have been so much pressed upon by white settlers that\r\ntheir numbers have been reduced. A large reservation, showing on the\r\nrecord nineteen full sections, was set off here, in 1876, for these\r\nIndians. It is nearly all on the bare sides of the mountain walls of the\r\ncañon. As usual, the village site was not taken in by the lines.\r\nTherefore white settlers have come in and the Indians been driven away.\r\nWe were informed that a petition was in circulation for the restoration\r\nto the public domain of a part of this reservation. We could not succeed\r\nin finding a copy of this petition; but it goes without saying that any\r\nsuch petition means the taking away from the Indians the few remaining\r\nbits of good land in their possession. There are now only about sixty\r\nIndians left in this cañon. Sixteen years ago there were from one\r\nhundred and fifty to two hundred—a flourishing community with large\r\nherds of cattle and horses and good cultivated fields. It is not too\r\nlate for the Government to reclaim the greater part of this cañon for\r\nits rightful owners' use. The appended affidavits, which we forwarded to\r\nWashington, will show the grounds on which we earnestly recommended such\r\na course.\r\n\r\n                              PAPER NO. 1.\r\n\r\nCopy of Colonel Magruder's order locating the Indians in Capitan Grande.\r\n\r\n                                  Mission San Diego, February 1st, 1853.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby given to Patricio and Leandro, alcalde and captain,\r\nto cultivate and live at the place called Capitan Grande, about four\r\nleagues to the south and east of Santa Ysabel, as it is with extreme\r\ndifficulty that these Indians can gain a subsistence on the lands near\r\nthe mission in consequence of the want of sufficient water for\r\nirrigation.

D. 1853, by an order issued by Colonel\r\nMagruder, of the United States Army, located at the post of San Diego on\r\nFebruary 1st of said year, 1853. That since that time we and our\r\nfamilies have resided on and possessed said lands. That said lands are\r\nincluded in township 14 south, range 2 east, of San Bernardino meridian\r\nin San Diego County, State of California.\r\n\r\nThat affiants are informed and believe that Daniel C. Isham, James\r\nMeade, Mary A. Taylor, and Charles Hensley have each of them filed in\r\nthe land office of Los Angeles their application for pre-emption or\r\nhomestead of lands included in the lands heretofore possessed by\r\naffiants, and now occupied by the rancheria of affiants as a home for\r\nthemselves and families. That said affiants and their tribe have\r\nconstantly occupied and partly cultivated the land so claimed by said\r\nIsham, Meade, Taylor, and Hensley since the year 1853. That they nor\r\ntheir tribe have ever signed any writing yielding possession or\r\nabandoning their rights to said lands; but that said parties heretofore\r\nmentioned are attempting by deceit, fraud, and violence to obtain said\r\nlands from affiants and the Government of the United States. Affiants\r\ntherefore pray that the land officers of the United States Government\r\nwill protect them in their right, and stay all proceedings on the part\r\nof said claimants until the matter is thoroughly investigated and the\r\nrights of the respective parties adjudicated.\r\n\r\n                                               IGNACIO CURO, his + mark.\r\n                                                 MARCELLINO, his + mark.\r\n\r\nWitness: M.

Ubach, in regard to Capitan Grande\r\nIndians, and in the matter of the application of Daniel Isham, James\r\nMeade, Mary A. Taylor, and Charles Hensley.\r\n\r\nAnthony D. Ubach, being first duly sworn, on oath deposes and says: I am\r\nnow, and have been continuously for the last seventeen years, Catholic\r\npastor at San Diego, and have frequently made official visitations to\r\nthe various Indian villages or rancherias in said county; that I have\r\nfrequently during said time visited the Capitan Grande Rancheria, on the\r\nSan Diego River, in said county of San Diego; that when I first visited\r\nsaid rancheria, some seventeen years ago, the Indians belonging to the\r\nrancheria cultivated the valley below the falls on the San Diego River\r\nand herded and kept their stock as far up as said falls; that I know the\r\nplace now occupied and claimed by the above-named applicants, and each\r\nof them, and also the place occupied and claimed by Dr. D. W. Strong;\r\nthat from the time I first visited said rancheria until the lands were\r\noccupied by the aforesaid white men said lands were occupied,\r\ncultivated, and used by the Indians of Capitan Grande Rancheria as a\r\npart of their rancheria; that upon one occasion I acted as interpreter\r\nfor Capitan Ignacio Curo in a negotiation between said Capitan Ignacio\r\nand D. W. Strong, and that said Strong at that time rented from said\r\nIgnacio a portion of the rancheria lands for bee pasture; I also know\r\nthat Capt. A. P. Knowles and A. S. Grant also rented the lands from the\r\nIndians of the rancheria when they first located there.\r\n\r\n                                                       ANTHONY D.

S. Manasse, being first duly sworn, on oath deposes and says: I am\r\nnow, and have been continuously since the year 1853, a resident of said\r\ncounty of San Diego; that I have known these certain premises on the San\r\nDiego River, said county, known as the Capitan Grande Rancheria, since\r\nthe year 1856; that at that time and for many years thereafter the\r\nIndians belonging to said Capitan Grande Rancheria occupied and\r\ncultivated their fields as far up as the falls on the San Diego River;\r\nthat the premises now occupied by the above-named applicants were so\r\noccupied and cultivated by the Indians belonging to said rancheria\r\nduring the time aforesaid; I know that about one year ago Capt. A. P.\r\nKnowles paid rent to Ignacio Curo for a portion of the land now claimed\r\nby the above-named applicant, Charles Hensley; also that when I first\r\nknew of the rancheria and for many years thereafter the Indians of that\r\nrancheria owned and kept there a considerable number of cattle, horses,\r\nand sheep.\r\n\r\n                                                          J. S. MANASSE.\r\n\r\nThe lands above referred to as claimed by Dr. D. W. Strong were patented\r\nby him September 15th, 1882. They include all the lands formerly\r\ncultivated by the Indians and used for stock pasturage at the head of\r\nthe cañon. When, at the expiration of his first year's lease of the\r\ntract for bee pasturage, the Indians asked if he wished to renew the\r\nlease he informed them that he should stay and file on the land. His\r\nlines are as follows: N. E. 1/4 of N. E. 1/4, S. 1/2 of N. E. 1/4, and\r\nN. W. 1/4 of S. E. 1/4, Sec. 2, T. 14 S., R. 2 E., S. B. M., Home. No.\r\n969.\r\n\r\nCharles Hensley's homestead entry is as follows: No. 986, March 29th,\r\n1882. S. 1/2 of N. W. 1/4 and W. 1/2 of S. W. 1/4, Sec. 22, T. 14 S., R.\r\n2 E., S. B. M. This is on the original site of the Indian village, and\r\nHensley is living in Capitan Ignacio Curo's house, for which, after\r\nbeing informed that he had to leave it at any rate and might as well get\r\na little money for it, Ignacio took a small sum of money.\r\n\r\nJames Meade's entry, which included Mary Taylor's interest, is as\r\nfollows: No. 987, March 29th, 1882. N. 1/2 of N. W. 1/4 and N. 1/2 of N.\r\nE. 1/4, Sec. 22, T. 14 S., R. 2 E., S. B. M. Captain Knowles's lines we\r\ndid not ascertain. He claims and in one way or another occupies several\r\ntracts in the cañon.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT J.\r\n\r\nTHE SEQUAN INDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe Sequan Indians are a small band of Dieguino Indians living in a rift\r\nof the hills on one side of the Sweetwater Cañon, about twenty miles\r\nfrom San Diego. There are less than fifty of them all told. They are\r\nbadly off, having for the last ten years been more and more encroached\r\non by white settlers, until now they can keep no cattle, and have little\r\ncultivable land left. There is a small reservation of one section set\r\noff for them, but the lines were never pointed out to them, and they\r\nsaid to us they did not know whether it were true that they had a\r\nreservation or not. They had heard also that there was an agent for the\r\nIndians, but they did not know whether that were true or not. As nearly\r\nas we could determine, this village is within the reservation lines; and\r\nif it is, some of the fields which have been recently taken away from\r\nthe Indians by the whites must be also. They had the usual bundle of\r\ntattered \"papers\" to show, some of which were so old they were hardly\r\nlegible. One of them was a certificate from a justice of the peace in\r\nSan Diego, setting forth that this justice, by virtue of power in him\r\nvested by the California State law, did—\r\n\r\n\"permit hereby all these Indians to occupy peaceably and without\r\ndisturbance all the certain land and premises heretofore occupied and\r\nheld by these Indians aforesaid, including all their right and title to\r\nall other necessary privileges thereto belonging, mainly the water\r\nnecessary for the irrigation of their lands.\"\r\n\r\nThese Indians are much dispirited and demoralized, and wretchedly poor.\r\nProbably the best thing for them would be, in case the Capitan Grande\r\nCañon is cleared of whites and assured to the Indians, to remove there\r\nand join the Capitan Grande band.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT K.\r\n\r\nTHE CONEJOS.\r\n\r\nThe Conejos are of the Dieguino tribe. Their village is said to be\r\npartly on the Capitan Grande Reservation. One man familiar with the\r\nregion told us that the reservation line ran through the centre of the\r\nConejos village. The village is reached only by a nine-miles horseback\r\ntrail, and we did not visit it. The captain came to San Diego to see us,\r\nand we also learned many particulars of the village from an intelligent\r\nranchwoman who has spent eleven summers in its vicinity. There are\r\nthirty-two men, twenty-six women, and twenty-two children in the band.\r\nThey have good fields of wheat, and raise corn, squashes, and beans; yet\r\nthere is not a plough in the village. The captain is very strenuous in\r\nhis efforts to make all his Indians work. When strange Indians come to\r\nthe village to visit, they also are set to work. No one is allowed to\r\nremain longer than three days without lending a hand at the village\r\nlabor. They are a strong and robust band. They say they have always\r\nlived in their present place. The captain asked for ploughs, harnesses,\r\nand \"all things to work with,\" also for some clothes for his very old\r\nmen and women. He also begged to be \"told all the things he ought to\r\nknow;\" said no agent had ever visited them, and \"no one ever told them\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nIn many of their perplexities they are in the habit of consulting Mrs.\r\nGregory, and she often mounts her horse and rides nine miles to be\r\npresent at one of their councils. Not long ago one of their number, a\r\nvery young Indian, having stabbed a white man living near Julian, was\r\narrested, put in jail, and in imminent danger of being lynched by the\r\nJulian mob. They were finally persuaded, however, to give him up to his\r\ntribe to be tried and punished by them. Mrs. Gregory was sent for to be\r\npresent at the trial. The facts in the case were, that the Irishman had\r\nattempted to take the young Indian's wife by force. The husband\r\ninterfering, the Irishman, who was drunk, fired at him, upon which the\r\nIndian drew his knife and stabbed the Irishman. Mrs. Gregory found the\r\nyoung Indian tied up in the snow, a circle of Indians sitting around\r\nhim. Recounting the facts, the captain said to Mrs. Gregory, \"Now, what\r\ndo you think I ought to do?\" \"Would you think he deserved punishment if\r\nit were an Indian he had stabbed under the same circumstances?\" asked\r\nMrs. Gregory. \"Certainly not,\" was the reply, \"we should say he did just\r\nright.\" \"I think so too,\" said Mrs. Gregory; \"the Irishman deserved to\r\nbe killed.\" But the captain said the white people would be angry with\r\nhim if no punishment were inflicted on the young man; so they whipped\r\nhim and banished him from the rancheria for one year. Mrs. Gregory said\r\nthat during the eleven years that they had kept their cattle ranch in\r\nthe neighborhood of this village, but one cow had ever been stolen by\r\nthe Indians; and in that instance the Indians themselves assisted in\r\ntracking the thief, and punished him severely.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT L.\r\n\r\nPALA AND ITS NEIGHBORHOOD.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the prosperity of the San Luis Rey Mission, Pala was one\r\nof its chief appanages. It lies an easy day's journey from San Luis Rey,\r\nin the valley of the San Luis Rey River. It has also a little stream of\r\nits own, the Pala Creek. It is a beautiful spot, surrounded by high\r\nhills, with wooded spars, and green bits of meadow here and there. The\r\nruins of the old mission buildings are still standing, and services are\r\nheld several times a year in the dilapidated chapel. It has always been\r\na favorite spot with the San Luis Rey Indians, some five or six hundred\r\nof whom are living in the region. The chief settlements are Pala, Pauma,\r\nApeche, La Jolla, and Rincon. At Pala, La Jolla, and Rincon are\r\nreservations. Of the Pala Reservation some tracts have been restored to\r\nthe public domain, to be patented to whites. The remainder of this\r\nreservation, so far as we could learn its location, contains very little\r\ngood land, the greater part of it being in the wash of the creek. The\r\nRincon Reservation is better, being at the head of the valley, directly\r\non the river, walled in to the south by high mountains. It is, as its\r\nname signifies, in a corner. Here is a village of nearly two hundred\r\nIndians; their fields are fenced, well irrigated, and under good\r\ncultivation in grains and vegetables. They have stock—cattle, horses,\r\nand sheep. As we drove into the village, an Indian boy was on hand with\r\nhis hoe to instantly repair the break in the embankment of the ditches\r\nacross which we were obliged to drive. These Indians have been reported\r\nto us as being antagonistic and troublesome, having refused to have a\r\nGovernment school established there. Upon inquiry of them we found that\r\nthe latter fact was true. They said they wanted a title to their lands,\r\nand till they had that they did not wish to accept anything from the\r\nGovernment; that the agent had promised it to them again and again, but\r\nthat they had now lost faith in ever getting it. The captain said: \"The\r\ncommissioners come one day and tell us we own the lands and fields; the\r\nnext day comes somebody and measures, and then we are out of our houses\r\nand fields, and have to live like dogs.\" On the outskirts of this\r\nvillage is living a half-breed, Andrew Scott, who claims some of the\r\nIndians' fields and cuts off part of their water supply. He is reported\r\nas selling whiskey to them, and in this and other ways doing them great\r\nharm. It is not improbable that he would be found to be within the\r\nreservation lines.\r\n\r\nBetween the Rincon and Pala lies the Pauma village. It is on the Pauma\r\nRanch, the purchase of which for Indian occupancy we have recommended to\r\nthe Government. This ranch is now rented, and the Indians are much\r\ninterfered with by the lessee, who is naturally reluctant to lose the\r\nprofit off a single acre of the land. There is in the original grant of\r\nthe Pauma Ranch the following clause: \"They shall have free the arable\r\nlands now occupied by the Indians who are established thereon, as also\r\nthe lands they may need for their small quantity of live stock.\"\r\n\r\nThe La Jolla region we were unable to visit. The Indian village is said\r\nto be outside the reservation lines. There is a claim against this\r\ntract, and the La Jolla captain told us that the parties representing it\r\nhad said to him that they were coming in with sheep next year, and would\r\ndrive all the Indians out. Upon inquiry at the surveyor-general's office\r\nin San Francisco in regard to the La Jolla tract, we learned that there\r\nis a record on file in the archives of that department purporting to\r\nshow that there was a grant made in favor of the Indians of San Luis\r\nRey, Pablo, and José Apis, for a tract of land named La Jolla, in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the Valle de San José, dated November 7th, 1845,\r\nsigned by Pio Pico; deposited in the archives January 31st, 1878. From\r\nMr. Chauncey M. Hayes, a resident of San Luis Rey, the agent of the\r\nPauma Ranch, we received the following letter on the subject of La\r\nJolla:\r\n\r\n\"La Jolla was granted November 7th, 1845, by the Mexican Government to\r\nJosé and Pablo Apis Indians, Expediente No. 242, and is recorded in the\r\nsurveyor-general's office, in book No. 4, p. 17. It was not presented to\r\nthe land commissioner in 1858, and remained without any action being\r\ntaken. Col. Cave J. Couts, now deceased, bought the interest of the\r\ngrantees, and a contract was afterwards made between Judge E. D. Sawyer,\r\nof San Francisco, and himself to secure its approval by a special act of\r\nCongress. About three years ago an act was passed approving the grant\r\nfor about 8,848 acres, reserving therefrom all lands then occupied. If\r\nthis included Indians, there would not be much of La Jolla left.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this is a claim which should be closely investigated.\r\nThe probabilities are that it would not bear such investigation. In Pala\r\nsome of the Indians had been ejected from their homes under\r\ncircumstances of great cruelty and injustice; affidavits setting forth\r\nthe facts in their case were forwarded by us to Washington (see Paper\r\nNo. 1, appended hereto). It is to be hoped that the Indians can be\r\nreinstated in their homes. If the Pauma Ranch be purchased for Indian\r\noccupancy, as we recommend, it will, with the present reservation tracts\r\nof the Rincon, Pala, and La Jolla, make a sizable block of land, where\r\nthe Indians will be comparatively free from white intrusion, and where\r\nthey will have a good chance to support themselves by agriculture and\r\nstock-raising.\r\n\r\n                  PAPER NO. 1, APPENDED TO EXHIBIT L.\r\n\r\nAffidavit of the claims of Arthur Golsh, Gaetano Golsh, and others, to a\r\ncertain piece of land in township of Pala.\r\n\r\nPatricio Soberano and Felipe Joqua, being duly sworn by me through an\r\ninterpreter, and the words hereof being interpreted to each and every\r\none of them, each for himself deposes and says: I am an Indian belonging\r\nto that portion of the San Luisenos Indians under the captainship of\r\nJosé Antonio Sal, and belonging in the rancheria of Pala. I have\r\noccupied the land in question ever since my childhood, together with\r\nGeromino Lugo and Luis Ardillo, our wives and families numbering in all\r\ntwenty-nine persons. I have resided on the land in question continuously\r\nuntil December, 1882. About five years ago one Arthur Golsh rented of\r\nLuis Ardillo a portion of said land for three months at a rental of $5\r\nper month. After this, said Golsh claimed the property of Ardillo and of\r\nthe three other Indians; ordered them to leave; used threats; on one\r\noccasion aimed a pistol at Patricio Soberano. He then proceeded to file\r\non the land, and obtained a patent for the land, while these Indians\r\nwere still residing upon it. The said Indians had upon the said land\r\nfour houses, one of which is adobe, various enclosed fields, and a long\r\nditch for bringing irrigation water to the said lands. In spite of the\r\nthreats of Arthur Golsh and others, we continued to occupy the lands\r\nuntil December, 1882, when we were informed by Agent S. S. Lawson that\r\nif we did not leave voluntarily we would be put off by the sheriff.\r\n\r\nSaid affiants therefore pray that said land be returned to the said\r\nIndians by the United States Government.\r\n\r\nSigned by Patricio Soberano and Felipe Joqua in presence of the justice\r\nof the peace, in Pala.\r\n\r\n                               EXHIBIT M.\r\n\r\nTHE PACHANGA INDIANS.\r\n\r\nThis little band of Indians is worthy of a special mention. They are San\r\nLuisenos, and formerly lived in the Temecula Valley, where they had good\r\nadobe houses and a large tract of land under cultivation. The ruins of\r\nthese houses are still standing there, also their walled graveyard full\r\nof graves. There had been a settlement of Indians in this Temecula\r\nValley from time immemorial, and at the time of the secularization of\r\nthe missions many of the neophytes of San Luis Rey returned thither to\r\ntheir old home. At the time of the outbreak of the Aqua Caliente\r\nIndians, in 1851, these Temecula Indians refused to join in it and moved\r\ntheir families and stock to Los Angeles for protection. Pablo, their\r\nchief at that time, was a man of some education, could read and write,\r\nand possessed large herds of cattle and horses. This Temecula Valley was\r\na part of the tract given to the San Luisenos and Dieguinos by the\r\ntreaty of January 3d, 1853, referred to in the body of this report. (See\r\npage 460.) In 1873 a decree of ejectment against these Indians was\r\nobtained in the San Francisco courts without the Indians' knowledge. The\r\nSan Diego Union of September 23d, 1875, says on the subject:\r\n\r\n\"For forty years these Indians have been recognized as the most thrifty\r\nand industrious Indians in all California. For more than twenty years\r\npast these Indians have been yearly told by the United States\r\ncommissioners and agents, both special and general, as well as by their\r\nlegal counsel, that they could remain on these lands. Now, without any\r\nprevious knowledge by them of any proceedings in court, they are ordered\r\nto leave their lands and homes. The order of ejectment has been served\r\non them by the sheriff of San Diego County. He is not only commanded to\r\nremove these Indians, but to take of their property whatever may be\r\nrequired to pay the costs incurred in the suit.\"\r\n\r\nComment on the extracts would be superfluous. There is not often so much\r\nof history condensed in the same number of newspaper paragraphs. A\r\nportion of these Temecula Indians, wishing to remain as near their old\r\nhomes and the graves of their dead as possible, went over in the\r\nPachanga cañon, only three miles distant. It was a barren, dry spot; but\r\nthe Indians sunk a well, built new houses, and went to work again. In\r\nthe spring of 1882, when we first visited the place, there was a\r\nconsiderable amount of land in wheat and barley, and a little fencing\r\nhad been done. In July, 1882, the tract was set off by Executive order\r\nas a reservation for these Indians. In the following May we visited the\r\nvalley again. Our first thought on entering it was, Would that all\r\npersons who still hold to the belief that Indians will not work could\r\nsee this valley. It would be hardly an extreme statement to say that the\r\nvalley was one continuous field of grain. At least four times the amount\r\nof the previous year had been planted. Corrals had been built, fruit\r\norchards started; one man had even so far followed white men's example\r\nas to fence in his orchard a piece of the road which passed his place.\r\nThe whole expression of the place had changed; so great a stimulus had\r\nthere been to the Indians in even the slight additional sense of\r\nsecurity given by the Executive order setting off their valley as a\r\nreservation. And, strangely enough, as if Nature herself had conspired\r\nat once to help and to avenge these Indians in the Temecula Valley from\r\nwhich they had been driven out, the white men's grain crops were thin,\r\npoor, hardly worth cutting; while the Indians' fields were waving high\r\nand green—altogether the best wheat and barley we had seen in the\r\ncounty. It is fortunate that this little nook of cultivable land was set\r\naside as a reservation. Had it not been it would have been \"filed on\"\r\nbefore now by the whites in the region, who already look with envy and\r\nchagrin on the crops the Indian exiles have wrested from land nobody\r\nthought worth taking up.\r\n\r\nA Government school has been opened here within the past year, and the\r\nscholars have made good progress. We found, however, much unpleasant\r\nfeeling among the Indians in regard to the teacher of this school, owing\r\nto his having a few years before driven off four Indian families from\r\ntheir lands at Pala, and patented the lands to himself. There were also\r\nother rumors seriously affecting his moral character which led us to\r\nmake the suggestion in regard to the employment of female teachers in\r\nthese Indian schools. (See report recommendation.) As one of the Indians\r\nforcibly said, to set such men as this over schools was like setting the\r\nwolf to take care of the lambs.\r\n\r\nThese Pachanga Indians had, before the setting aside of their tract as a\r\nreservation, taken steps towards the securing of their cañon, and the\r\ndividing it among themselves under the provisions of the Indian\r\nHomestead Act. They were counselled to this and assisted in it by\r\nRichard Eagan, of San Juan Capistrano, well known as a good friend of\r\nthe Indians. They have expressed themselves as deeply regretting that\r\nthey were persuaded to abandon this plan and have the tract set off as a\r\nreservation. They were told that they could in this way get their\r\nindividual titles just as securely and without cost. Finding that they\r\nhave no individual titles, and cannot get them, they are greatly\r\ndisappointed. It would seem wise to allow them as soon as possible to\r\ncarry out their original intention. They are quite ready and fit for it.\r\n\r\n                               EXHIBIT N.\r\n\r\nTHE DESERT INDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe Indians known as the Desert Indians are chiefly of the Cahuilla\r\ntribe, and are all under the control of an aged chief named Cabezon, who\r\nis said to have more power and influence than any Indian now living in\r\nCalifornia. These Indians' settlements are literally in the desert; some\r\nof them being in that depressed basin, many feet below sea-level, which\r\nall travellers over the Southern Pacific Railroad will recollect. There\r\nis in this desert one reservation, called Aqua Caliente, of about 60,000\r\nacres. From the best information that we can get this is all barren\r\ndesert land, with only one spring in it. These Desert Indians are\r\nwretchedly poor, and need help perhaps more than any others in Southern\r\nCalifornia. We were unable to visit these Indians personally, but were\r\nso fortunate as to induce Capt. J. G. Stanley, a former Indian agent for\r\nthe Mission Indians and a warm friend of theirs, to go out in our stead\r\nand report to us on their condition. His report is herewith given:—\r\n\r\n_Mrs. H. H. Jackson_:\r\n\r\nMADAM,—In compliance with your request I proceeded to the Cabezon\r\nValley, and have endeavored, as far as was possible with the limited\r\ntime at my command, to ascertain the present condition and actual\r\nnecessities of these Indians that still inhabit that portion of the\r\nColorado Basin known as the Cabezon Valley, that being also the name of\r\nthe head chief, who, from the best information that can be obtained, is\r\nnot less than ninety and probably one hundred years old, and who still\r\nhas great influence with all the Indians in that region. I found it\r\nimpracticable to visit all the rancherias, and accordingly sent out\r\nrunners and called a council of all the Indians of all the villages, to\r\nbe held at a point on the railroad known as Walter's Station, that being\r\nthe most central point. The next day there were present in council about\r\none hundred Indians, including the captains of all the rancherias and\r\nthe old chief Cabezon. Having been special agent under the old\r\nsuperintendent system, and well acquainted with the Indians, I was\r\nreceived by them with the greatest cordiality. I read and interpreted\r\nyour letter to Cabezon, and also explained that you were not able to\r\nvisit them in person on account of ill health. The Indians, through\r\ntheir spokesman or interpreter, then stated their cause of complaint.\r\nFirst, that Mr. Lawson had never visited their villages nor taken any\r\ninterest in their welfare; that he had allowed his interpreter, Juan\r\nMorengo, to take the advantage of them; that Juan Morengo had made a\r\ncontract for them with a man in San Bernardino to cut wood on land\r\nclaimed by the Indians for the railroad company, he taking the lion's\r\nshare on the profits, and agreeing to pay them every Saturday in money;\r\nthat Juan Morengo took some $200 belonging to the Indians and\r\nappropriated it to his own use; that the contractor did not pay as\r\nagreed, but wished the Indians to take poor flour and other articles at\r\na great price. There may be some exaggeration of the causes of\r\ncomplaint, but it is evident that no one has looked after the rights of\r\nthese Indians. The Indians have stopped cutting the wood, and they say\r\nthe contractor tells them he will send others to cut wood if they will\r\nnot do it. If I understand rightly this is Government land, and no one\r\nhas a right to cut the timber. It is true, it is mesquite timber, and\r\nthey profess to cut only the dry trees, but the mesquite is invaluable\r\nto the Indians. It not only makes their fires, but its fruit supplies\r\nthem with a large amount of subsistence. The mesquite bean is used green\r\nand dry, and at the present time is their principal article of food.\r\nMoreover, without the mesquite tree the valley would be an absolute\r\ndesert. The wood (the dead trees) could be made a source of employment\r\nand profitable revenue to the Indians if cut with proper regulations,\r\nbut the present mode is destruction to the timber, and benefits but few\r\nof the Indians. I have extended my remarks on this subject, as I think\r\nit very important. If the wood is to be cut the Indians should be\r\nsupplied with wagons and harness that they may do all the work of\r\ndelivering the wood and get the profit of their labor. I would suggest\r\nthat it is very important that a tract of country be segregated and set\r\napart for these Indians. There is a vast amount of desert land in their\r\ncountry, but there are spots in it that have been occupied by them for\r\nhundreds of years where wheat, corn, melons, and other farm products can\r\nbe grown. There is very little running water, but water is so near the\r\nsurface that it can be easily developed. The Indians appear to know\r\nnothing of any lands being set apart for them, but claim the whole\r\nterritory they have always occupied. I think that to avoid complications\r\nsomething should be done for these Indians immediately to protect their\r\ninterests. At present there are eight villages or rancherias, each with\r\nits own captain, but all recognizing old Cabezon as head chief. I\r\nascertained from each captain the number belonging to his village, and I\r\nfound the aggregate to be 560 souls. These Indians are not what are\r\ncalled Christianized Indians. They never belonged to the missions and\r\nhave never been received into any church. They believe in spirits and\r\nwitchcraft. While I was among them I was told by a white man that the\r\nIndians intended to kill one of their number because he had bewitched a\r\nman and made him sick. I asked the interpreter about it. He acknowledged\r\nit to be true, but said they only intended to frighten him so that he\r\nwould let the man alone. I told him it would be wrong to kill the\r\nIndian, and he said they would not do it. They are very anxious to have\r\nschools established amongst them, and are willing to all live in one\r\nvillage if a suitable place can be selected. I shall offer as my opinion\r\nthat immediate steps should be taken to set apart lands for these\r\nIndians, that they be permitted to cut wood for sale only on the public\r\nlands in Cabezon Valley, that no one be permitted to cut any green\r\ntimber in the valley, that two strong wagons and harness for twelve\r\nhorses be furnished (or loaned) to the Indians for the purpose of\r\nhauling wood only, that lumber be furnished to make sheds for said\r\nwagons and harness. The Indians have horses of their own.\r\n\r\n                All of which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n                                                          J. G. STANLEY.\r\n\r\n                               EXHIBIT O.\r\n\r\nTHE SAN GORGONIO RESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThis is the only reservation of any size or value in Southern\r\nCalifornia. It lies in the San Gorgonio Pass, between the San Bernardino\r\nand San Jacinto Mountains. The Southern Pacific Railroad passes\r\nthroughout it. It is a large tract, including a considerable proportion\r\nof three townships. It is in an exposed situation, open to the desert\r\nwinds, and very hot in summer. A small white settlement, called Banning,\r\nlies in this district. Most of the titles to these settlements are said\r\nto have been acquired before the reservation was set off. We received\r\nfrom the settlers in Banning the following letter:\r\n\r\n_To Mrs. Jackson and Mr. Kinney, Commissioners, &c._:\r\n\r\nAt a public meeting of all the residents on the lands reserved for\r\nIndian purposes, held at Banning, in San Gorgonio Pass, San Bernardino\r\nCounty, California, it was resolved that a delegation from our\r\ninhabitants be appointed to proceed to San Bernardino, and lay before\r\nthe commissioners a statement of the existing status of the lands\r\nreserved for Indian purposes as affecting the citizens resident on those\r\ntownships known as 2 and 3 S., R. 1 E., and 2 S., R. 2 E., in San\r\nBernardino meridian. Believing that it is of the utmost importance that\r\nyou should become conversant with facts affecting the condition and\r\nfuture well-being of the Indians whom it is designed to place upon these\r\nlands, we respectfully request a hearing. Among those facts as affecting\r\nthe residents directly, and more remotely the Indians, are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nThere is in San Gorgonio Township, of which these lands are a part, a\r\npopulation of two hundred and fifty souls. In township 3 S., R. 1 E., is\r\nthe village of Banning, which is the business centre of the surrounding\r\ncountry, and has an immediately surrounding population numbering fifty\r\nsouls. It has post and express offices, railroad depot, district school,\r\nchurch organization, general merchandise store, the flume of the San\r\nGorgonio Fluming Company, two magistrates; and during the last year\r\nthere was sold or shipped from this place alone fully 20,000 bushels of\r\nwheat and barley, over 200 tons of baled hay, a large amount of honey,\r\nbutter, eggs, poultry, live stock, &c., besides 200 cords of wood.\r\nAlthough more than half of the area of this township is in the mountains\r\nand uninhabited, from the remaining portion which is surveyed land,\r\nthere is at this time fully 1,200 acres in grain, and the value of the\r\nimproved property is over $50,000, exclusive of railroad property.\r\nVested interests have been acquired to all the water available for\r\nirrigation under the code of laws existing in this State. Wells have\r\nrepeatedly been dug without success in this township. United States\r\npatents to lands were granted in this township long anterior to the\r\nExecutive order reserving the lands for Indian purposes, and since then\r\nthe population has not increased. No Indian has, within the memory of\r\nman, resided in this township. There are not over two entire sections of\r\nland in the entire area left available for cultivation; and on these,\r\nwithout abundance of water, no one could possibly succeed in earning a\r\nlivelihood. One of these sections was occupied and was abandoned, the\r\nattempt to raise a cereal crop having failed. The extreme aridity of the\r\nclimate renders the successful growth of cereals problematical, even\r\nwhen summer fallowing is pursued, and the amount of human casualty\r\npossessed by the average Indian does not usually embrace the period of\r\ntwo years. To intersperse Indians between white settlers who own the\r\nrailroad land or odd sections and the remaining portions of the\r\nGovernment sections, where a \"no fence\" law exists, as here, would not\r\nbe conducive to the well-being of the Indians, and would result in a\r\ndepreciation of our property alike needless and disastrous. In township\r\n2 S., R. 2 E., there are not over eighty acres available,—that in Weaver\r\nCreek cañon, where the water was acquired and utilized before the\r\nExecutive order and the legal right well established. In township 2 S.,\r\nR. 1 E., settlements were made many years before the issue of the order\r\nof reservation, especially on odd-numbered sections or railroad lands as\r\nthen supposed to be, and these bona-fide settlers have acquired claims\r\nin equity to their improvements. On one ranch in this township,—that of\r\nMessrs. Smith & Stewart, who have cultivated and improved the mesa or\r\nbench lands,—there was produced several thousand sacks of grain; but\r\nthis involved such an outlay of capital and knowledge, beside experience\r\nin grain-growing such as Indians do not possess. In this township,\r\nembracing the three mentioned, there are upward of forty voters; and\r\nthese unanimously and respectfully ask you to grant us a hearing, when\r\nwe can reply to any interrogatories you may be pleased to make. If you\r\nwill kindly name the time when to you convenient, the undersigned will\r\nat once wait upon you.\r\n\r\n                                                         W. K. DUNLAP,\r\n                                                         BEN. W. SMITH,\r\n                                                         S. Z. MILLARD,\r\n                                                         WELWOOD MURRAY,\r\n                                                         GEO. C. EGAN,\r\n                                                         D. A. SCOTT,\r\n                                                         G. SCOTT.\r\n\r\nThere is upon this San Gorgonio Reservation a considerable amount of\r\ntillable land. There are also on it several small but good water-rights.\r\nOne of these springs, with the adjacent land, is occupied by an Indian\r\nvillage, called the Potrero, numbering about sixty souls,—an industrious\r\nlittle community, with a good amount of land fenced and under\r\ncultivation. These Indians are in great trouble on account of their\r\nstock, the approaches to their stock-ranges having been by degrees all\r\nfenced off by white settlers, leaving the Indians no place where they\r\ncan run their cattle without risk of being corralled and kept till fines\r\nare paid for their release. All the other springs except this one are\r\nheld by white settlers, who with one exception, we were informed, have\r\nall come on within the past five years. They claim, however, to have\r\nbought the rights of former settlers. One of the largest blocks of this\r\nreservation lies upon the San Bernardino Mountain, and is a fair\r\nstock-range. It is now used for this purpose by a man named Hyler. The\r\nnext largest available block of land on the reservation is now under\r\ntillage by the dry system by the firm of Smith & Stewart. There is also\r\na bee-ranch on the reservation, belonging to Herron & Wilson. One of the\r\nsprings and the land adjacent are held by a man named Jost. He is on\r\nunsurveyed land, but claims that by private survey he has ascertained\r\nthat he is on an odd-numbered section, and has made application to the\r\nrailroad for the same. He requested us to submit to the Department his\r\nestimate of the value of his improvements. It is appended to this\r\nexhibit. It seems plain from the above facts, and from the letter of the\r\nBanning gentleman, that a considerable number of Indians could be\r\nadvantageously placed on this reservation if the whites were removed. It\r\nwould be necessary to acquire whatever titles there may be to tracts\r\nincluded in the reservation; also to develop the water by the\r\nconstruction of reservoirs, &c., probably to purchase some small\r\nwater-rights. Estimating roughly, we would say by an expenditure of from\r\n$30,000 to $40,000 this reservation could be rounded out and put into\r\nreadiness for Indians. It ought to be most emphatically stated and\r\ndistinctly understood that without some such preparation as this in the\r\nmatter of water-rights and channels the Indians cannot be put there. It\r\nis hardly possible for one unfamiliar with the Southern California\r\ncountry to fully understand how necessary this is. Without irrigation\r\nthe greater portion of the land is worthless, and all arrangements for\r\ndeveloping, economizing, and distributing water are costly. This is an\r\nobjection to the San Gorgonio Reservation. There are two others. The\r\nIndians for the most part have an exceeding dislike to the region, and\r\nwill never go there voluntarily,—perhaps only by force. The alternative\r\nof railroad sections with the sections of the reservations will surely\r\nlead to troubles in the future between the white settlers and the\r\nIndians. These are serious objections; but it is the only large block of\r\nland the Government has left available for the purpose of Indian\r\noccupancy.\r\n\r\n                                     PAPER NO. 1, APPENDED TO EXHIBIT O.\r\n\r\nClaim of C.

Cloth. $1.50.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jackson devoted a whole year of her life to writing and compiling\r\nmaterials for \"A Century of Dishonor,\" and while thus engaged she\r\nmentally resolved to follow it with a story which should have for its\r\n_motif_ the cause of the Indian. After completing her \"Report on the\r\nCondition and Needs of the Mission Indians of California\" (see Appendix,\r\np. 458) she set herself down to this task, and \"Ramona\" is the result.\r\nThis was in New York in the winter of 1883-84, and while thus engaged\r\nshe wrote her publisher that she seemed to have the whole story at her\r\nfingers' ends, and nothing but physical impossibility prevented her from\r\nfinishing it at a sitting. Alluding to it again on her death-bed, she\r\nwrote: \"I did not write 'Ramona;' it was written through me. My\r\nlife-blood went into it,—all I had thought, felt, and suffered for five\r\nyears on the Indian question.\"\r\n\r\nThe report made by Mrs. Jackson and Mr. Kinney is grave, concise, and\r\ndeeply interesting. It is added to the Appendix of this new edition of\r\nher book. In this California journey Mrs. Jackson found the materials\r\nfor \"Ramona,\" the Indian novel, which was the last important work of her\r\nlife, and in which nearly all the incidents are taken from life. In the\r\nreport of the Mission Indians will be found the story of the Temecula\r\nremoval, and the tragedy of Alessandro's death, as they appear in\r\n\"Ramona.\"—_Boston Daily Advertiser._\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Jackson's Letter of Gratitude to the President.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Mrs. Jackson to the President was written by\r\nher four days before her death, Aug. 12, 1885:—\r\n\r\n_To_ GROVER CLEVELAND, _President of the United States_:\r\n\r\nDear Sir,—From my death-bed I send you a message of heartfelt thanks for\r\nwhat you have already done for the Indians. I ask you to read my\r\n\"Century of Dishonor.\" I am dying happier for the belief I have that it\r\nis your hand that is destined to strike the first steady blow toward\r\nlifting this burden of infamy from our country, and righting the wrongs\r\nof the Indian race.\r\n\r\n                      With respect and gratitude,\r\n\r\n                                                          HELEN JACKSON.\r\n\r\n_Sold by all booksellers.

(50th thousand.)\r\n\r\n_The Atlantic Monthly_ says of the author that she is \"a Murillo in\r\nliterature,\" and that the story \"is one of the most artistic creations\r\nof American literature.\" Says a lady: \"To me it is the most distinctive\r\npiece of work we have had in this country since 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' and\r\nits exquisite finish of style is beyond that classic.\" \"The book is\r\ntruly an American novel,\" says the _Boston Advertiser_. \"Ramona is one\r\nof the most charming creations of modern fiction,\" says CHARLES D.\r\nWARNER. \"The romance of the story is irresistibly fascinating,\" says\r\n_The Independent_. \"The best novel written by a woman since George Eliot\r\ndied, as it seems to me, is Mrs. Jackson's 'Ramona,'\" says T. W.\r\nHIGGINSON.\r\n\r\nZEPH. A Posthumous Story. 12mo. Cloth. Price, $1.25.\r\n\r\nThose who think that all the outrage and wrong are on the side of the\r\nman, and all the suffering and endurance on the side of the woman,\r\ncannot do better than read this sad and moving sketch. It is written by\r\na woman; but never, I think, have I heard of more noble and\r\nself-sacrificing conduct than that of the much-tried husband in this\r\nstory, or conduct more vile and degrading than that of the woman who\r\nwent by the name of his wife. Such stories show how much both sexes have\r\nto forgive and forget. The author, who died before she could complete\r\nthis little tale of Colorado life, never wrote anything more beautiful\r\nfor its insight into human nature, and certainly never anything more\r\ninstinct with true pathos. A writer of high and real gifts as a novelist\r\nwas lost to the world by the untimely death of Mrs. Jackson.—_The\r\nAcademy, London._\r\n\r\nBETWEEN WHILES. A Collection of Stories. 12mo. Cloth. Price, $1.25.\r\n\r\nMrs. Helen Jackson's publishers have collected six of her best short\r\nstories into this volume. Most of them appeared in magazines in the last\r\nyear or two of her life. \"The Inn of the Golden Pear,\" the longest and\r\nby far the strongest of them all, is, however, entirely new to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nOutside of her one great romance (\"Ramona\"), the author has never\r\nappealed to the human heart with more simple and beautiful certainty\r\nthan in these delightful pictures.—_Bulletin, San Francisco._\r\n\r\nMrs. Helen Jackson's \"Little Bel's Supplement,\" the touching story of a\r\nyoung schoolmistress in Prince Edward's Island, is not likely to be\r\nforgotten by any one who has read it. The high and splendid purpose that\r\ndirected the literary work of \"H. H.,\" and which is apparent in nearly\r\neverything that came from her pen, was supported by a peculiar power,\r\nunerring artistic taste, and a pathos all her own. This charming tale\r\nand one about the Adirondacks and a child's dream form part of the\r\ncontents of this posthumous volume, to which, on her death-bed, she gave\r\nthe beautiful title \"Between Whiles.\" It is worthy to be placed\r\nalongside of her most finished pieces.—_Commercial Advertiser, New\r\nYork._\r\n\r\nMERCY PHILBRICK'S CHOICE. 16mo. Cloth. Price, $1.00.\r\n\r\nHETTY'S STRANGE HISTORY. 16mo. Cloth. Price, $1.00.\r\n\r\nThese two stories were originally published anonymously, having been\r\nwritten for the \"No Name Series\" of novels, in which they had a large\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nBITS OF TRAVEL. Square 18mo. Cloth, red edges. Price, $1.25.\r\n\r\nThe volume has few of the characteristics of an ordinary book of travel.\r\nIt is entertaining and readable, from cover to cover; and when the\r\nuntravelled reader has finished it, he will find that he knows a great\r\ndeal more about life in Europe—having seen it through intelligent and\r\nsympathetic eyes—than he ever got before from a dozen more pretentious\r\nvolumes.—_Hartford Courant._\r\n\r\nBITS OF TRAVEL AT HOME. Square 18mo. Cloth, red edges. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of American scenery in this volume indicate the\r\nimagination of a poet, the eye of an acute observer of Nature, the hand\r\nof an artist, and the heart of a woman.\r\n\r\nH. H.'s choice of words is of itself a study of color. Her picturesque\r\ndiction rivals the skill of the painter, and presents the woods and\r\nwaters of the Great West with a splendor of illustration that can\r\nscarcely be surpassed by the brightest glow of the canvas. Her\r\nintuitions of character are no less keen than her perceptions of\r\nNature.—_N. Y. Tribune._\r\n\r\nGLIMPSES OF THREE COASTS: California and Oregon; Scotland and England;\r\nNorway, Denmark, and Germany. 12mo. Cloth. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nHelen Hunt Jackson has left another monumental memorial of her literary\r\nlife in the volume entitled \"Glimpses of Three Coasts,\" which is just\r\npublished and includes some fourteen papers relating to life in\r\nCalifornia and Oregon, in Scotland and England, and on the North Shore\r\nof Europe in Germany, Denmark, and Norway. The sketches are marked by\r\nthat peculiar charm that characterizes Mrs. Jackson's interpretations of\r\nNature and life. She had the divining gift of the poet; she had the\r\npower of philosophic reflection; and these, with her keen observation\r\nand swift sympathies and ardent temperament, make her the ideal\r\ninterpreter of a country's life and resources.—_Traveller, Boston._\r\n\r\nBITS OF TALK ABOUT HOME MATTERS. Square 18mo. Cloth, red edges. Price,\r\n$1.00.\r\n\r\n\"Bits of Talk\" is a book that ought to have a place of honor in every\r\nhousehold; for it teaches, not only the true dignity of parentage, but\r\nof childhood. As we read it, we laugh and cry with the author, and\r\nacknowledge that, since the child is father of the man, in being the\r\nchampion of childhood, she is the champion of the whole coming race.\r\nGreat is the rod, but H. H. is not its prophet!—MRS. HARRIET PRESCOTT\r\nSPOFFORD, _in Newburyport Herald_.\r\n\r\nPOEMS: Complete, comprising \"Verses by H. H.\" and \"Sonnets and Lyrics.\"\r\nSquare 18mo. Red edges, price, $1.50; white cloth, gilt, $1.75.\r\n\r\nShortly after the publication of \"Verses\" Ralph Waldo Emerson walked\r\ninto the office of the publishers and inquired for the \"Poems of H. H.\"\r\nWhile he was looking at it the attendant ventured to remark that H. H.\r\nwas called our greatest woman poet. \"The 'woman' might well be omitted,\"\r\nwas the only reply of the Concord philosopher. He was then engaged in\r\ncompiling his poetical anthology (Parnassus), in the preface to which he\r\nsays: \"The poems of a lady who contents herself with the initials H. H.\r\nin her book, published in Boston (1874), have a rare merit of thought\r\nand expression, and will reward the reader for the careful attention\r\nwhich they require.\"\r\n\r\n                               JUVENILES.\r\n\r\nBITS OF TALK, in Verse and Prose. For Young Folks. Square 18mo. Cloth.\r\nPrice, $1.00.\r\n\r\nIt is just such a book as children will enjoy, made up as it is of a\r\nvariety of attractive reading, short stories, fairy tales, parables, and\r\npoems, with here and there a chapter of good advice, given in such a\r\ntaking way without a bit of goody talk, that the children will find it\r\npleasant to take, little as they like advice after the usual\r\nfashion.—_Worcester Spy._\r\n\r\nNELLY'S SILVER MINE. A Story of Colorado Life. With Illustrations. 16mo.\r\nCloth. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\n\"Nelly's Silver Mine\" is one of those stories which, while having the\r\nnoble simplicity and freshness whereby the young are captivated, is full\r\nof a thought and wisdom which command for it the attention of\r\nall.—_Philadelphia Inquirer._\r\n\r\nCAT STORIES. Containing \"Letters from a Cat,\" \"Mammy Tittleback and her\r\nFamily,\" and \"The Hunter Cats of Connorloa,\" bound in one volume. Small\r\n4to. Cloth. Price, $2.00; or, each volume separately, $1.25.\r\n\r\nThe subject is attractive, for there is nothing children take a more\r\nreal interest in than cats; and the writer has had the good sense to\r\nwrite neither above nor below her subject. The type is large, so that\r\nthose for whom the book is intended may read it themselves.... For\r\ndetails we must refer all interested to the story itself, which seems to\r\nus written with admirable verisimilitude.—_London Academy._\r\n\r\n_Sold by all booksellers. Mailed, post-paid, on receipt of the price, by\r\nthe publishers_,\r\n\r\n                                               ROBERTS BROTHERS, BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Century of Dishonor, by Helen Hunt Jackson",
