Never\r\nin this happy country or elsewhere--except in the Land of Miracle,\r\nwhere \"they did all eat and were filled\"--has there been enough of\r\nanything for the people. Never since time began have all the sons\r\nand daughters of men been all warm, and all filled, and all shod and\r\nroofed. Never yet have all the virgins, wise or foolish, been able to\r\nfill their lamps with oil.\r\n\r\nThe world, enriched by thousands of generations of toilers and\r\nthinkers, has reached a fertility which can give every human being\r\na plenty undreamed of even in the Utopias. But between this plenty\r\nripening on the boughs of our civilization and the people hungering for\r\nit step the \"cornerers,\" the syndicates, trusts, combinations, with\r\nthe cry of \"over-production\"--too much of everything. Holding back the\r\nriches of earth, sea, and sky from their fellows who famish and freeze\r\nin the dark, they declare to them that there is too much light and\r\nwarmth and food. They assert the right, for their private profit, to\r\nregulate the consumption by the people of the necessaries of life, and\r\nto control production, not by the needs of humanity, but by the desires\r\nof a few for dividends. The coal syndicate thinks there is too much\r\ncoal. There is too much iron, too much lumber, too much flour--for this\r\nor that syndicate.\r\n\r\nThe majority have never been able to buy enough of anything; but this\r\nminority have too much of everything to sell.\r\n\r\nLiberty produces wealth, and wealth destroys liberty. \"The splendid\r\nempire of Charles V.,\" says Motley, \"was erected upon the grave of\r\nliberty.\" Our bignesses, cities, factories, monopolies, fortunes,\r\nwhich are our empires, are the obesities of an age gluttonous beyond\r\nits powers of digestion. Mankind are crowding upon each other in the\r\ncentres, and struggling to keep each other out of the feast set by the\r\nnew sciences and the new fellowships. Our size has got beyond both our\r\nscience and our conscience. The vision of the railroad stockholder is\r\nnot far-sighted enough to see into the office of the General Manager;\r\nthe people cannot reach across even a ward of a city to rule their\r\nrulers; Captains of Industry \"do not know\" whether the men in the\r\nranks are dying from lack of food and shelter; we cannot clean our\r\ncities nor our politics; the locomotive has more man-power than all the\r\nballot-boxes, and mill-wheels wear out the hearts of workers unable to\r\nkeep up beating time to their whirl. If mankind had gone on pursuing\r\nthe ideals of the fighter, the time would necessarily have come when\r\nthere would have been only a few, then only one, and then none left.\r\nThis is what we are witnessing in the world of livelihoods. Our ideals\r\nof livelihood are ideals of mutual deglutition. We are rapidly reaching\r\nthe stage where in each province only a few are left; that is the\r\nkey to our times. Beyond the deep is another deep. This era is but a\r\npassing phase in the evolution of industrial Cæsars, and these Cæsars\r\nwill be of a new type--corporate Cæsars.\r\n\r\nFor those who like the perpetual motion of a debate in which neither\r\nof the disputants is looking at the same side of the shield, there are\r\ninfinite satisfactions in the current controversy as to whether there\r\nis any such thing as \"monopoly.\" \"There are none,\" says one side.\r\n\"They are legion,\" says the other. \"The idea that there can be such a\r\nthing is absurd,\" says one, who with half a dozen associates controls\r\nthe source, the price, the quality, the quantity of nine-tenths of a\r\ngreat necessary of life. But \"There will soon be a trust for every\r\nproduction, and a master to fix the price for every necessity of\r\nlife,\" said the Senator who framed the United States Anti-Trust Law.\r\nThis difference as to facts is due to a difference in the definitions\r\nthrough which the facts are regarded. Those who say \"there are none\"\r\nhold with the Attorney-General of the United States and the decision\r\nhe quotes from the highest Federal court which has yet passed on this\r\nquestion[1] that no one has a monopoly unless there is a \"disability\"\r\nor \"restriction\" imposed by law on all who would compete. A syndicate\r\nthat had succeeded in bottling for sale all the air of the earth\r\nwould not have a monopoly in this view, unless there were on the\r\nstatute-books a law forbidding every one else from selling air. No\r\nothers could get air to sell; the people could not get air to breathe,\r\nbut there would be no monopoly because there is no \"legal restriction\"\r\non breathing or selling the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nExcepting in the manufacture of postage-stamps, gold dollars, and a\r\nfew other such cases of a \"legal restriction,\" there are no monopolies\r\naccording to this definition. It excludes the whole body of facts\r\nwhich the people include in their definition, and dismisses a great\r\npublic question by a mere play on words. The other side of the shield\r\nwas described by Judge Barrett, of the Supreme Court of New York. A\r\nmonopoly he declared to be \"any combination the tendency of which is\r\nto prevent competition in its broad and general sense, and to control\r\nand thus at will enhance prices to the detriment of the public.... Nor\r\nneed it be permanent or complete. It is enough that it may be even\r\ntemporarily and partially successful. The question in the end is, Does\r\nit inevitably tend to public injury?\"[2]\r\n\r\nThose who insist that \"there are none\" are the fortunate ones who came\r\nup to the shield on its golden side. But common usage agrees with\r\nthe language of Judge Barrett, because it exactly fits a fact which\r\npresses on common people heavily, and will grow heavier before it grows\r\nlighter.\r\n\r\nThe committee of Congress investigating trusts in 1889 did not report\r\nany list of these combinations to control markets, \"for the reason\r\nthat new ones are constantly forming, and that old ones are constantly\r\nextending their relations so as to cover new branches of the business\r\nand invade new territories.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that such a list, like a dictionary, would begin to be\r\nwrong the moment it began to appear. But though only an instantaneous\r\nphotograph of the whirlwind, it would give an idea, to be gained\r\nin no other way, of a movement shadowing two hemispheres. In an\r\nincredible number of the necessaries and luxuries of life, from meat\r\nto tombstones, some inner circle of the \"fittest\" has sought, and very\r\noften obtained, the sweet power which Judge Barrett found the sugar\r\ntrust had: It \"can close every refinery at will, close some and open\r\nothers, limit the purchases of raw material (thus jeopardizing, and in\r\na considerable degree controlling, its production), artificially limit\r\nthe production of refined sugar, enhance the price to enrich themselves\r\nand their associates at the public expense, and depress the price when\r\nnecessary to crush out and impoverish a foolhardy rival.\"\r\n\r\nCorners are \"acute\" attacks of that which combinations exhibit as\r\nchronic. First a corner, then a pool, then a trust, has often been\r\nthe genesis. The last stage, when the trust throws off the forms of\r\ncombination and returns to the simpler dress of corporations, is\r\nalready well along. Some of the \"sympathetical co-operations\" on record\r\nhave no doubt ceased to exist. But that they should have been attempted\r\nis one of the signs of the time, and these attempts are repeated again\r\nand again until success is reached.\r\n\r\nThe line of development is from local to national, and from national\r\nto international. The amount of capital changes continually with the\r\nrecrystallizations in progress. Not less than five hundred million\r\ndollars is in the coal combination, which our evidence shows to have\r\nflourished twenty-two years; that in oil has nearly if not quite two\r\nhundred millions; and the other combinations in which its members are\r\nleaders foot up hundreds of millions more. Hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars are united in the railroads and elevators of the Northwest\r\nagainst the wheat-growers. In cattle and meat there are not less than\r\none hundred millions; in whiskey, thirty-five millions; and in beer\r\na great deal more than that; in sugar, seventy-five millions; in\r\nleather, over a hundred millions; in gas, hundreds of millions. At\r\nthis writing a union is being negotiated of all the piano-makers in\r\nthe United States, to have a capital of fifty millions. Quite beyond\r\nordinary comprehension is the magnitude of the syndicates, if there is\r\nmore than one, which are going from city to city, consolidating all\r\nthe gas-works, electric-lighting companies, street-railways in each\r\ninto single properties, and consolidating these into vast estates for\r\ncentral corporations of capitalists, controlling from metropolitan\r\noffices the transportation of the people of scores of cities. Such\r\na syndicate negotiating in December, 1892, for the control of the\r\nstreet-railways of Brooklyn, was said by the New York _Times_, \"on\r\nabsolute authority, to have subscribed $23,000,000 towards that end,\r\nbefore a single move had been made or a price set on a single share\r\nof stock.\" It was in the same hands as those busy later in gathering\r\ntogether the coal-mines of Nova Scotia and putting them under American\r\ncontrol. There are in round numbers ten thousand millions of dollars\r\nclaiming dividends and interest in the railroads of the United\r\nStates. Every year they are more closely pooled. The public saw them\r\nmarshalled, as by one hand, in the maintenance of the high passenger\r\nrates to the World's Fair in the summer of 1893.\r\n\r\nMany thousands of millions of dollars are represented in these\r\ncentralizations. It is a vast sum, and yet is but a minority of our\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nLaws against these combinations have been passed by Congress and by\r\nmany of the States. There have been prosecutions under them by the\r\nState and Federal governments. The laws and the lawsuits have alike\r\nbeen futile.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases names and form of organization have been changed, in\r\nconsequence of legal pursuit. The whiskey, sugar, and oil trusts had\r\nto hang out new signs. But the thing itself, the will and the power to\r\ncontrol markets, livelihoods, and liberties, and the toleration of this\r\nby the public--this remains unimpaired; in truth, facilitated by the\r\ngreater secrecy and compactness which have been the only results of the\r\nappeal to law.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General of the national government gives a large part of\r\nhis annual report for 1893 to showing \"what small basis there is for\r\nthe popular impression\" \"that the aim and effect of this statute\" (the\r\nAnti-Trust Law) \"are to prohibit and prevent those aggregations of\r\ncapital which are so common at the present day, and which sometimes\r\nare on so large a scale as to practically control all the branches\r\nof an extensive industry.\" This executive says of the action of the\r\n\"co-ordinate\" Legislature: \"It would not be useful, even if it were\r\npossible, to ascertain the precise purposes of the framers of the\r\nstatute.\" He is the officer charged with the duty of directing the\r\nprosecutions to enforce the law; but he declares that since, among\r\nother reasons, \"all ownership of property is a monopoly, ... any\r\nliteral application of the provisions of the statute is out of the\r\nquestion.\" Nothing has been accomplished by all these appeals to the\r\nlegislatures and the courts, except to prove that the evil lies deeper\r\nthan any public sentiment or public intelligence yet existent, and is\r\nstronger than any public power yet at call.\r\n\r\nWhat we call Monopoly is Business at the end of its journey. The\r\nconcentration of wealth, the wiping out of the middle classes, are\r\nother names for it. To get it is, in the world of affairs, the chief\r\nend of man.\r\n\r\nThere are no solitary truths, Goethe says, and monopoly--as the\r\ngreatest business fact of our civilization, which gives to business\r\nwhat other ages gave to war and religion--is our greatest social,\r\npolitical, and moral fact.\r\n\r\nThe men and women who do the work of the world have the right to the\r\nfloor. Everywhere they are rising to \"a point of information.\" They\r\nwant to know how our labor and the gifts of nature are being ordered\r\nby those whom our ideals and consent have made Captains of Industry\r\nover us; how it is that we, who profess the religion of the Golden Rule\r\nand the political economy of service for service, come to divide our\r\nproduce into incalculable power and pleasure for a few, and partial\r\nexistence for the many who are the fountains of these powers and\r\npleasures. This book is an attempt to help the people answer these\r\nquestions. It has been quarried out of official records, and it is a\r\nventure in realism in the world of realities. Decisions of courts and\r\nof special tribunals like the Interstate Commerce Commission, verdicts\r\nof juries in civil and criminal cases, reports of committees of the\r\nState Legislatures and of Congress, oath-sworn testimony given in legal\r\nproceedings and in official inquiries, corrected by rebutting testimony\r\nand by cross-examination--such are the sources of information.\r\n\r\nOne important exception is in the description of the operations of\r\na great international combination in England, Germany, Holland, and\r\nelsewhere in Europe; this has had to be made from unofficial material.\r\nThe people there are neither economically nor politically developed\r\nto the point we have reached in America, of using the legislative\r\ninvestigation and the powers of the courts to defend livelihoods and\r\nmarket rights, and enforce the social responsibilities of industrial\r\npower. Full and exact references are given throughout for the guidance\r\nof the investigator. The language of witnesses, judges, and official\r\nreports has been repeated verbatim, except for the avoidance of the\r\nsurplusage and reduplication usual in such literature, and that, to\r\npermit the use of the dialogue form, the construction has been changed\r\nfrom the third person to the first in quotations from evidence. With\r\nthese qualifications, wherever quotation marks have been used, the\r\ntranscription is word for word. Evidence from such sources is more\r\nexact, circumstantial, and accurate than that upon which the mass of\r\nhistorical literature is founded.\r\n\r\nTo give the full and official history of numbers of these\r\ncombinations, which are nearly identical in inspiration, method, and\r\nresult, would be repetition. Only one of them, therefore, has been\r\ntreated in full--the oil trust. It is the most successful of all the\r\nattempts to put gifts of nature, entire industries, and world markets\r\nunder one hat. Its originators claim this precedence. It was, one of\r\nits spokesmen says, \"the parent of the trust system.\"[3] It is the best\r\nillustration of a movement which is itself but an illustration of the\r\nspirit of the age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCUT OFF FROM FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nRome banished those who had been found to be public enemies by\r\nforbidding every one to give them fire and water. That was done by\r\nall to a few. In America it is done by a few to all. A small number\r\nof men are obtaining the power to forbid any but themselves to supply\r\nthe people with fire in nearly every form known to modern life and\r\nindustry, from matches to locomotives and electricity. They control\r\nour hard coal and much of the soft,[4] and stoves, furnaces, and steam\r\nand hot-water heaters; the governors on steam-boilers and the boilers;\r\ngas and gas-fixtures; natural gas and gas-pipes; electric lighting,\r\nand all the appurtenances. You cannot free yourself by changing from\r\nelectricity to gas, or from the gas of the city to the gas of the\r\nfields. If you fly from kerosene to candles, you are still under the\r\nban.\r\n\r\nThe report adopted by the National Association of Stove Manufacturers,\r\nat the Thirteenth Annual Convention, 1884, said: \"While it is true\r\nthat iron is a dollar or two lower than last year, and that the cost\r\nof labor has also been reduced, your committee is confident that there\r\nis not a manufacturer present who can truthfully say he can afford to\r\nreduce the price of his goods.\" \"It is a chronic case,\" the President\r\nsaid in 1888, \"of too many stoves, and not enough people to buy them.\"\r\n\r\nThe match company, by whose consent all the fires in the United States\r\nand Canada are lighted, was organized, as stated, by the Supreme Court\r\nof Michigan, for the purpose of controlling the manufacture and trade.\r\nThirty-one manufacturers, owning substantially all the factories\r\nwhere matches were made in the United States, either went into the\r\ncombination, or were purchased by the match company, and out of this\r\nnumber all were closed except about thirteen.\r\n\r\nOne of the company, who has been a conspicuous candidate for a\r\nnomination to the presidency of the United States, testified that the\r\nprice of matches was kept up to pay the large sums of money expended\r\nto exclude others from the match business, remove competition, buy up\r\nmachinery and patents, and purchase other match factories. This was\r\ntold in a suit between two stockholders on a question of their relative\r\nrights; but the court, of its own motion, declared the combination\r\nillegal, and took notice of the public interests involved.[5]\r\n\r\n\"Such a vast combination is a menace to the public,\" said the court.\r\n\"It is no answer to say that this monopoly has, in fact, reduced the\r\nprice of friction-matches. That policy may have been necessary to\r\ncrush competition. The fact exists that it rests in the discretion of\r\nthis company at any time to raise the price to an exorbitant degree.\"\r\n\"Indeed, it is doubtful if free government can long exist in a country\r\nwhere such enormous amounts of money are allowed to be accumulated in\r\nthe vaults of corporations, to be used at discretion in controlling the\r\nproperty and business of the country against the interest of the public\r\nand that of the people, for the personal gain and aggrandizement of a\r\nfew individuals.\"\r\n\r\nWithin the last thirty years, 95 per cent. of the anthracite coal of\r\nAmerica--practically the entire supply, it was reported by Congress in\r\n1893--has passed from the ownership of private citizens, many thousands\r\nin number, into the possession of the railroads controlling the\r\nhighways of the coal-fields.\r\n\r\nThese railroads have been undergoing a similar process of\r\nconsolidation, and are now the property of eight great corporations.\r\nThis surrender of their property by the individual coal-mine owners is\r\na continuing process, in operation at this moment, for the complete\r\nextinction of the \"individual\" and the independents in this field. It\r\nis destined, according to the report of Congress of 1893,[6] to end\r\n\"in the entire absorption ... of the entire anthracite coal-fields and\r\ncollieries by ... the common carriers.\"\r\n\r\nAnthracite coal is geographically a natural monopoly contained in three\r\ncontiguous fields which, if laid close together, would not cover more\r\nthan eight miles by sixty. But bituminous coal, although scattered\r\nin exhaustless measures all over the continent, is being similarly\r\nappropriated by the railroads, and its area is being similarly limited\r\nartificially by their interference.\r\n\r\n\"Railroad syndicates,\" says the investigation of 1888,[7] \"are buying\r\nall the best bituminous coal lands along their lines in Missouri,\r\nKansas, Colorado, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, and other Western\r\nStates and Territories, no doubt with a view of levying tribute upon\r\nthe people's fuel and the industrial fires of the country.\"\r\n\r\nCanada remains unannexed politically, but its best coal deposits\r\nhave become a part of the United States. In 1892 a syndicate of\r\nAmerican capitalists obtained the control of the principal bituminous\r\ncoal-mines of Nova Scotia. Among them were men connected both with the\r\nanthracite pool and with the combination which seeks control of the oil\r\nmarket of Canada and of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe process of consolidation is shown by official and judicial\r\ninvestigations to have been in progress in the bituminous fields at\r\nleast as far back as 1871, with the same purposes, methods, and results\r\nas in the anthracite fields, though more slowly, on account of the\r\ngreater number and vastness of the deposits. From Pennsylvania to the\r\nPacific coast these are narrowed to the territory along the railroads,\r\nand narrowed there again to the mines owned or favored by the railroad\r\nmanagers.\r\n\r\nThe investigations by Congress in 1888 and 1893 both state that the\r\nrailroads of the country are similarly becoming the owners of our iron\r\nand timber lands, and both call upon the people to save themselves. A\r\nnew law of industry is rising into view. Ownership of the highways ends\r\nin ownership of everything and everybody that must use the highways.\r\n\r\nThe railroads compel private owners to sell them their mines or all the\r\nproduct by refusing to supply cars for their business, and by charging\r\nrates for the transportation of coal so high that every one but\r\nthemselves loses money on every ton sent to market. When the railroads\r\nelect to have the output large, they furnish many cars; when they elect\r\nto have the output small, they furnish few cars; and when they elect\r\nthat there shall be no output whatever, they furnish no cars.\r\n\r\nOne of the few surviving independent coal producers, who is losing\r\nheavily on every ton he sends to market, but keeps on in the hope that\r\nthe law will give him redress, was asked by a committee of Congress why\r\nhe did not sell out and give up the business? He was willing, he said,\r\nto abide the time when his rights on the railroad could be judicially\r\ndetermined. There was another reason. \"It might be considered a very\r\nsentimental one. I have spent, sir, considerable time and a large\r\namount of energy and skill in building up my business, and I rather\r\nlike to continue it.\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words, you don't want to be forced to sell out?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I don't want to be forced to sell my product, any more than I\r\nwant to be forced to sell my collieries.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThough coal is an article of commerce greater in volume than any other\r\nnatural product in the United States carried on railroads, amounting to\r\nnot less than 130,000,000 tons a year; and though the appliances for\r\nits transportation have been improved, and the cost cheapened every\r\nyear, so that it can be handled with less cost and risk than almost any\r\nother class of freight, the startling fact appears in the litigations\r\nbefore the Interstate Commerce Commission and the investigations by\r\nCongress, that anthracite freight rates have been advanced instead of\r\nbeing decreased, are higher now than they were in 1879, and that coal\r\nis made by these confederated railroads to pay rates vastly higher\r\nthan the average of all other high and low class freight, nearly\r\ndouble the rate on wheat or cotton. These high freight rates serve\r\nthe double purpose of seeming to justify the high price of coal, and\r\nof killing off year by year the independent coal-producers. What the\r\nrailroad coal-miner pays for freight returns to its other self, the\r\nrailroad. What the independent coal-producer pays goes also to the\r\nrailroad, his competitor. \"This excess over just and reasonable rates\r\nof transportation constitutes an available fund by which they (the\r\nrailroads) are enabled to crush out the competition of independent\r\ncoal-producers.\"[9]\r\n\r\nBy these means, as Congress found in 1888,[10] the railroad managers\r\nhave forced the independent miners to sell to them or their friends\r\nat the price they chose to pay. They were the only possible buyers,\r\nbecause only they were sure of a supply of cars, and of freight rates\r\nat which they could live.\r\n\r\nThe private operators thus being frozen out are able, as the\r\ninvestigation by the New York Legislature in 1878 showed, to produce\r\ncoal more economically than the great companies, because not burdened\r\nwith extravagant salaries, royalties, and leases, interest on\r\nfictitious bonded debts, and dividends on false capitalization of\r\nwatered stock. By the laws of supply and demand they would compete out\r\nthe unwieldy corporations, but these administer a superior political\r\neconomy in their supply and demand of cars and freight rates. The\r\nunfittest, economically, survives.\r\n\r\n\"The railroad companies engaged in mining and transporting coal\r\nare practically in a combination to control the output and fix the\r\nprice.... They have a practical monopoly of the production, the\r\ntransportation, and sale of anthracite coal.\"[11] This has been the\r\nfinding in all the investigations for twenty years. \"More than one, if\r\nnot all, of the anthracite monopolies,\" Congress reported in 1888, \"run\r\nseveral of their mines in the name of private operators to quiet the\r\ngeneral clamor against carrying companies having a monopoly of mining\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\nThe anthracite collieries of Pennsylvania could now produce 50,000,000\r\ntons a year. The railroads restrict them to 40,000,000 or 41,000,000\r\ntons,[12] nine or ten million tons less than they could furnish to ward\r\noff the frosts of winter and to speed the wheels of the world, and this\r\ncreation of artificial winter has been in progress from the beginning\r\nof the combination.\r\n\r\nIn the ten months between February and November, 1892, the price of\r\ncoal in the East, as investigated by Congress in 1893,[13] was advanced\r\nby the coal railroads as much as $1.25 and $1.35 a ton on the kinds\r\nused by house-keepers, and the combinations, the report of Congress\r\nsays, \"exercise even a more baleful influence on the production and\r\ntransportation of coal for the Western market.\" The extortion in the\r\nprice fixed by the coal railroads was found by Congress, in 1888, to\r\nbe an average of one dollar a ton--\"considerably more than a dollar\r\na ton\"--on all consumed in the United States, or $39,000,000 in that\r\nyear, and now $40,000,000 to $41,000,000 a year. The same investigation\r\nfound that between 1873 and 1886 $200,000,000 more than a fair market\r\nprice was taken from the public by this combination.[14]\r\n\r\nThis in anthracite alone. How many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of\r\nmillions more have been taken by the railroads which control the\r\nbituminous coal-fields from Pennsylvania to the Pacific, there are no\r\nadjudicated means of estimating.\r\n\r\nBy the same power which has crushed out the independent coal-miner,\r\nthe retailer in the cities has been reduced from a free man to\r\nan instrument to despoil his neighbors--with whom he is often a\r\nfellow-victim--for the benefit of absentee capitalists; he is hounded\r\nby detectives; by threats of cutting off his supply, is made a\r\ncompulsory member of a secret oath-bound society to \"maintain prices.\"\r\n\"Combinations exist,\" says the Canadian report, \"among coal-dealers\r\nin Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and London. Detectives are employed\r\nand the dealers placed under surveillance.... Oaths of fidelity to\r\nthe constitution and rules are required not only of the members, but\r\nalso of their salesmen, and the oaths in the cases of these employés\r\nare made in some instances retroactive as well as prospective. All\r\nviolations of oaths are adjudicated upon by the executive committee\r\nreferred to, the penalties being heavy fines or expulsion.... In\r\naccordance with arrangements made with the American coal-dealers, those\r\nwho were in default in membership, either from inability to pay fines\r\nor from other causes, were prevented from purchasing coal in the United\r\nStates.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe retailer dare not tell his wrongs even in the committee-rooms\r\nof Congress. \"Your committee,\" says the report of 1893 to Congress,\r\n\"experienced great difficulty in obtaining testimony from retail\r\ncoal-dealers, who apparently labor under fears of injury to their\r\nbusiness in case they should appear and give evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"During the first forty years,\" Congress reported in 1888, \"the\r\nmines were worked by individuals, just as are farms. The hundreds of\r\nemployers were in active competition with each other for labor. The\r\nfundamental law of supply and demand alike governed all parties. As to\r\nengagement, employer and employé stood upon a common level of equality\r\nand manhood. Skill and industry upon the part of the miner assured to\r\nhim steady work, fair wages, honest measurement, and humane treatment.\r\nShould these be denied by one employer many other employers were ready\r\nto give them. The miner had the same freedom as to engagement, the same\r\nreward for faithful service, and protection against injustice that\r\nthe farm-hand possesses because of the competition between farmers\r\nemploying hands.... This virtual combination of all employers into one\r\nsyndicate has practically abolished competition between them as to\r\nwages; and gradually, but inexorably, the workmen have found themselves\r\nencoiled as by an anaconda until now they are powerless.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThere was an investigation of the coal combination by the Pennsylvania\r\nLegislature in 1871, the testimony taken in which showed that when,\r\nafter a thirty days' strike by the men, a number of private coal-mine\r\nowners acceded to their terms, and wished to reopen their mines and\r\nsend coal again to market, the railroads, by which alone they could get\r\nto market, raised their freights, as their men were still on strike,\r\nto three times the previous figures. These great corporations had\r\ndetermined not to yield to their men, and as they were mine-owners and\r\ncoal-sellers as well as carriers, they refused to take coal for their\r\ncompetitors.... The result was that the price of coal was doubled,\r\nrising to $12 a ton; the resumption by the private mine-owners was\r\nstopped; and they, the workmen, and the consumer were all delivered\r\nover to the tender mercies of the six great companies.[17]\r\n\r\nThe coal companies in the anthracite regions keep thousands of\r\nsurplus laborers on hand to underbid each other for employment and\r\nfor submission to all exactions; hold them purposely ignorant when\r\nthe mines are to be worked and when closed, so that they cannot\r\nseek employment elsewhere; bind them as tenants by compulsion in the\r\ncompanies' houses, so that rent shall run against them, whether wages\r\nrun on or not, and under leases by which they can be turned out with\r\ntheir wives and children on the mountain-side in midwinter if they\r\nstrike; compel them to fill cars of larger capacity than agreed upon;\r\nmake them buy their powder and other working outfit of the companies at\r\nan enormous advance on the cost; compel them to buy coal of the company\r\nat the company's price, and in many cases to buy a fixed quantity,\r\nmore than they need; compel them to employ the doctor named by the\r\ncompany, and to pay him whether sick or well; \"pluck\" them at the\r\ncompany's stores, so that when pay-day comes around the company owes\r\nthe men nothing, there being authentic cases where \"sober, hard-working\r\nminers toiled for years or even a lifetime without having been able to\r\ndraw a single dollar, or but a few dollars, in actual cash,\" in \"debt\r\nuntil the day they died;\" refuse to fix the wages in advance, but pay\r\nthem upon some hocus-pocus sliding scale, varying with the selling\r\nprice in New York, which the railroad slides to suit itself; and, most\r\nextraordinary of all, refuse to let the miners know the prices on which\r\ntheir living slides--a fraud, says the report of Congress, \"on its\r\nface.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe companies dock the miners' output arbitrarily for slate and other\r\nimpurities, and so can take from their men five to fifty tons more in\r\nevery hundred than they pay for.[19]\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the miners disciplined and the coal-market\r\nunder-supplied, the railroads restrict work so that the miners often\r\nhave to live for a month on what they can earn in six or eight days;\r\nand these restrictions are enforced upon their miners by withholding\r\ncars from them to fill, as upon competitors by withholding cars to go\r\nto market.[20]\r\n\r\nLabor organizations are forbidden, and the men intentionally provoked\r\nto strike, to affect the coal-market.\r\n\r\nThe laboring population of the coal regions, finally, is kept\r\n\"down\" by special policemen enrolled under special laws, and often\r\nin violation of law, by the railroads and coal and iron companies\r\npractically when and in what numbers these companies choose. These\r\ncoal and iron policemen are practically without responsibility to any\r\none but their employers, are armed as the corporations see fit with\r\narmy revolvers, or Winchester rifles, or both, are made detectives\r\nby statute, and not required to wear their shields. They provoke the\r\npeople to riot, and then shoot them legally.[21]\r\n\r\n\"By the percentage of wages,\" says the report of Congress, \"by false\r\nmeasurements, by rents, stores, and other methods, the workman is\r\nvirtually a chattel of the operator.\" It says, to summarize: \"The\r\ncarrier drives out both operator and owner, obtains the property, works\r\nthe mine, 'disciplines' the miner, lowers wages by the importation of\r\nHuns and Italians, restricts the output, and advances the price of coal\r\nto the public. It is enabled to commit such wrongs upon individuals\r\nand the public by virtue of exercising absolute control of a public\r\nhighway.\"[22]\r\n\r\nThe people of Pennsylvania, in 1873, adopted a new Constitution. To\r\nput an end to the consolidation of all the anthracite coal lands into\r\nthe hands of the railroads, this Constitution forbade common carriers\r\nto mine or manufacture articles for transportation over their lines,\r\nor to buy land except for carrying purposes. These provisions of the\r\nConstitution have been disobeyed \"defiantly.\" \"The railroads have\r\ndefiantly gone on acquiring title to hundreds of thousands of acres of\r\ncoal, as well as of neighboring agricultural lands.\" They have been\r\n\"aggressively pursuing the joint business of carrying and mining coal.\"\r\nSo far from quitting it, they \"have increased their mining operations\r\nby extracting bituminous as well as anthracite.\"[23]\r\n\r\nInstead of enacting \"appropriate legislation,\" as commanded by the\r\nnew Constitution, to effectuate its prohibitions, the Legislature has\r\npassed laws to nullify the Constitution by preventing forever any\r\nescheat to the State of the immense area of lands unlawfully held by\r\nthe railroads. Every effort breaking down to meet the evil by State\r\naction, failure was finally confessed by the passage in 1878, by the\r\nPennsylvania Legislature, of a joint resolution asking Congress to\r\nlegislate \"for equity in the rates of freight.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Law, and established\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission to enforce justice on the railway\r\nhighways. The independent mine-owners of Pennsylvania appealed to\r\nit. Two years and a half were consumed in the proceedings. The\r\nCommission decided that the rates the railroad charged were unjust\r\nand unreasonable, and ordered them reduced.[24] But the decision has\r\nremained unenforced, and cannot be enforced. The railroads treat the\r\nCommission with the same contumely they visit on the Constitution of\r\nPennsylvania, and two years after the decision Congress in 1893 found\r\ntheir rates to be 50 cents a ton higher than what the Commission had\r\ndeclared to be just and equitable.[25] The Interstate Commerce Law\r\nprovides for the imprisonment in the penitentiary of those guilty of\r\nthe crimes it covers. But the only conviction had under it has been of\r\na shipper for discriminating against a railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION THAT PROHIBITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThat which governments have not yet been equal to has been accomplished\r\nby the private co-operation of a few citizens. They decree at their\r\npleasure that in this town or that State no one shall manufacture\r\nalcohol, and they enforce the decree. Theirs is the only prohibition\r\nthat prohibits.\r\n\r\nFrom the famous whiskey ring of 1874 to the pool of 1881 and the\r\ntrust of 1887, and from the abandonment of that \"trust\" dress and\r\nthe reorganization into one corporation in 1890 down to the present,\r\nthis private regulation of the liquor traffic has gone on. It is\r\na regulation of a good deal more than the liquor traffic. Through\r\nits control of alcohol it is a power over the arts and sciences,\r\nthe manufacture and the preparation of medicines, and a power\r\nover politics. More than one chapter of our history exhibits the\r\ngovernment itself holding to these rectifiers relations suggestive\r\nof anything but rectification. The report of the investigation by\r\nCongress in 1893 notes the fact that on the strength of a rumor that\r\nthe internal-revenue tax was to be increased by Congress, the Trust\r\nraised its prices 25 cents a gallon. This would amount to a profit of\r\n$12,500,000 on its yearly output.\r\n\r\nBy February, 1888, all the important distilleries in the Northern\r\nStates--nearly eighty--were in the Trust, excepting two, the larger of\r\nwhich was in Chicago. The cases of these irreconcilable competitors\r\nwere set for consideration, according to the _Chicago Tribune's_\r\nreport, at a private meeting of the trustees February 3d. In April\r\nthe Chicago distillery firm published the fact that they had caught a\r\nspy of the Trust in their works. He had given them a confession in\r\nwriting. In September it was discovered that the valve of a vat in this\r\ndistillery had been tampered with in such a way as to have caused an\r\nexplosion had it not been found out in time. The next month its owners\r\nmade known that they had been offered and refused $1,000,000 from the\r\nTrust for their works. In December the country was startled by the\r\nnews that this distillery had been the scene of an awful explosion of\r\ndynamite. All the buildings in the neighborhood were shaken and many\r\npanes of glass were broken. A jagged hole about three feet square was\r\ntorn in the roof. There were 15,000 barrels of whiskey stored under\r\nthe roof that was torn open, and if these had been ignited a terrible\r\nfire would have been added to the effect of the explosion. A package of\r\ndynamite which had failed to explode, though the fuse had been lighted,\r\nwas found on the premises by the Chicago police.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago representative of the whiskey combination ridiculed the\r\nidea that the Trust had had anything to do with this. \"Such a thing,\"\r\nhe said, \"is contrary to the genius of a trust.\"\r\n\r\nThe wholesale liquor-dealers threatened, at a conference in 1890\r\nwith the president of the Trust, to manufacture for themselves, to\r\nescape the advance which had been made in the price of high-wines. The\r\npresident said, as reported in the _Wine and Spirit Gazette_:\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe there is a spirits distillery in the country that you\r\ncan buy. We own nearly all of them, and have at present seventy-eight\r\nidle distilleries.\"\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 1891, the explosion of December, 1888, was recalled by\r\nthe unexpected arrest of the secretary of the combination in Chicago\r\nby the United States authorities. The Grand Jury of Cook County found\r\nan indictment, February 17th, against the prisoner. April 20th he was\r\nindicted by the Federal Grand Jury. The crime of which he was charged\r\nwas attempting to bribe a government gauger to blow up the troublesome\r\ndistillery. The gauger whom the secretary endeavored to enlist had\r\nbeen loyal to his trust, the government, and had made known to his\r\nsuperiors the offer and purpose of the bribe.\r\n\r\nIf the explosion had been carried out 150 men at work in the distillery\r\nwould have been destroyed. The evidence given Congress afterwards\r\ntended to show that part of the plan was that the bribed gauger who\r\nwas to set and explode the infernal-machine was not to be allowed to\r\nsurvive to claim his reward and perhaps repent and tell. The fuse was\r\nfixed so that the explosion would be instantaneous instead of giving\r\nthe time promised him to get out of the way.\r\n\r\nIn a statement to the press, February 15th, the president of the Trust\r\nsaid, as the result of a conference of the trustees:\r\n\r\n\"We have unanimously agreed to stand by the secretary.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in June rumors were in circulation in New York that the Chicago\r\nindependent had sold out; and soon after the confirmation of the\r\nreport, with full details, was authoritatively published.\r\n\r\nJune 8th the judge of the United States Court in Chicago quashed the\r\nFederal indictment, on the ground that it is not a crime under any of\r\nthe United States laws for an internal-revenue officer to set fire to\r\na distillery of his own volition and impulse, and that it is not a\r\ncrime against the United States for another person to bribe him to do\r\nsuch an act. He held that the offender could be punished only through\r\nthe State courts. The United States had property in the distillery\r\nto the extent of $800,000 due for taxes, which was a legal lien on\r\nthe property; but the United States District Attorney and the judge\r\ncould find no Federal law under which, for the gauger to destroy this\r\nproperty of the United States, or for the Whiskey Trust to bribe him\r\nto do so, it was a crime. When the indictments framed by the State\r\nAttorney of Chicago came before the State courts, three of the four\r\nwere found defective and were quashed. The Chicago correspondent of\r\nthe New York _World_ telegraphed that he had been told by the State\r\nAttorney, at the time the Federal proceedings were quashed, that of his\r\nfour indictments he relied most upon that for conspiracy; \"but in court\r\nyesterday the State Attorney let the charge of conspiracy fall to the\r\nground because, as he said, there was not evidence enough to secure a\r\nconviction.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't the evidence of the gauger; I don't know where he is,\" the\r\nState Attorney said.\r\n\r\nBut this witness declared in a public letter in February, 1893, \"Myself\r\nand others with positive evidence were always ready to testify, and I\r\nhave the facts to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge of the State court held the motion to quash until July, and\r\nthen announced that he would make no decision until August. He withheld\r\nhis ruling until October. Then he held the secretary for trial on\r\ntwo counts, charging conspiracy to bribe the gauger and destroy the\r\nindependent distillery; but remarked \"informally,\" the newspapers said,\r\nthat conviction would be difficult.\r\n\r\nWhen the case was called March 22, 1892, a delay was granted \"until\r\nnext Monday,\" to enable the prisoner's counsel to read the \"bill of\r\nparticulars\" to find out what he was charged with. The secretary did\r\nnot trouble himself to attend court. His case was not heard of again\r\nuntil June 24th, when he was released on a nolle prosequi entered by\r\nthe State Attorney because the evidence was insufficient, and became a\r\nfree man. That was the end.\r\n\r\nOwing to this success of State and United States attorneys in being\r\nunsuccessful, the people have never had an opportunity of hearing in\r\ncourt the evidence on which the Government acted in making the arrest,\r\nand on which the grand juries found the indictments. But the gauger\r\nthrough whom the secretary of the Trust had attempted to execute his\r\nplans was called as a witness before the Committee of Congress which\r\ninvestigated the Trust in 1893, and he told again the story of the\r\ninfernal-machine. It was as follows, in his own words, omitting names\r\nand unnecessary details:\r\n\r\n\"I was United States internal-revenue gauger from 1879 until after\r\nMr. Cleveland's election, and I was reappointed in 1889, and have\r\nbeen continuously since that time. Late in December, 1890, I received\r\na letter from the secretary of the whiskey combination at Peoria,\r\ntelling me that he would like to meet me at the Grand Pacific Hotel on\r\nNew-year's Day. I met him. He said, 'You may be able to do considerable\r\ngood here; not only for us, but of considerable advantage to yourself.\r\nYour $1500 a year is nothing to what you would get by helping us. You\r\ncan get $10,000 by assisting us in this thing; in fact, to make matters\r\nright, you could get in three months $25,000.'\" The gauger reported\r\nthis to his superiors, who told him to go on. \"Be particular, and\r\nafter every interview with him make a note of everything that passes\r\nbetween you while it is fresh in your mind.\" \"I did that,\" the witness\r\ncontinued, \"and I have the original notes in my pocket. There are the\r\noriginal notes,\" exhibiting them to the committee. \"They have never\r\nleft my possession. I have kept them on my person right along.\" After\r\nsome correspondence and another interview, he met the secretary again\r\nJanuary 25th. \"Now,\" said the latter, \"I can give you something which,\r\nif put under a cistern, will in three or four hours go off, and no\r\nperson know what it was or who did it, and all the trouble that has\r\nbeen caused us will be stopped at once, the sufferings of many people\r\nstopped, and no loss to those folks, as they are well insured.\" \"When I\r\nrecovered from my surprise I asked if it was an explosive. He replied,\r\n'No; a simple but effective thing which would shoot a ball into a tub\r\nthrough the bottom. You will have $10,000 for your work of placing\r\nthis under a cistern of high-proof, either alcohol or spirits, or what\r\nis better than cash, 200 shares of stock.' I asked at what they sold.\r\nHe said, 'Forty-seven, but it would be up ten points at once,' and I\r\ncould profit by the raise. 'This will raise a big row.' 'Yes,' he said,\r\n'one cistern well caught, all would go, and it would be right into the\r\nwarehouse and stop everything at once. It is the most effective way to\r\nhelp us and make a clean job, and you having access to all parts of the\r\ndistillery and unsuspected is why you could do it so easily.' He had\r\nthen, in room 35, powder and four steel elongated balls, solid, turned,\r\nand with long points. The principal article, however, was a kind of\r\nyellowish liquid, which when exposed to sixty-five degrees temperature\r\nwould produce a flame caused by evaporation. I remarked that there\r\nwas probably no hurry about this thing, and he said, 'The sooner the\r\nbetter; you may be ordered away from here, and I am come all prepared;\r\neverything is ready to load, and that can be done quickly.'\"\r\n\r\nThe gauger reported all this to his superior and told him that \"I\r\nproposed to take the infernal apparatus.\" His superior said, \"Of\r\ncourse.\" \"I then returned to Grand Pacific, room 35; found loading just\r\ncompleted and much material scattered about, oakum in can saturated\r\nslightly with kerosene and alcohol to give good start. The secretary\r\nsaid that three fuses were attached to the gun, one of which would go\r\noff under water. He had one steel shell which had been shot through\r\nthree inches of wood in experimenting. He showed me particularly\r\nhow to place can; to feel underneath for timbers; put it where ball\r\nwill enter tub. Also, that in stopping over to meet the president\r\nof the combination to-morrow he would have a chance to buy up stock\r\nreasonably before our work caused the raise. He expected to buy 1000\r\nshares. Friday, the 30th of January, I rather anticipated a visit from\r\nthe secretary at my hotel, but I received a letter from him instead\r\nof a visit, and Judge Hart, the solicitor of the Internal-Revenue\r\nDepartment, who was there in Chicago, when he read the letter thought\r\nthat the evidence was certainly conclusive.\" On Sunday, the 8th, the\r\ngauger surrendered the box containing the infernal-machine, which was\r\nsealed, to a high official who had come on from New York. \"The reason\r\nwhy he came on is that the authorities would not believe my testimony.\r\nThey did not think it was possible a gentleman in the secretary's\r\nposition would undertake so heinous a crime, and they did not know\r\nbut what I was a crank. On Monday, the 9th, I was instructed to write\r\na letter. The thing was to arrest in a proper way. The next day I\r\nreceived a despatch: 'Will be at Pacific to-morrow (Wednesday) morning.'\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday morning the secretary was arrested, as he was about to enter\r\nthe hotel, by a deputy marshal, and conducted to the Marshal's office\r\nin the Government building. There was a bottle of this composition\r\nfound in his grip. He had told me it would go off in three or four\r\nhours. I was in the anteroom of the city grand jury after the chemist\r\nhad given his testimony. The chemist said that it was his opinion\r\nit would have or might have gone off in three seconds. Fire would\r\ncause the shooting of the ball, and the ball making a hole in the\r\ntub--alcohol or high-proof spirits--coming down, of course all would\r\nhave gone up. It could not have helped it, and the explosion would\r\nhave followed at once, not from the machine, but from the contents of\r\nthe cistern. They are very explosive indeed, alcohol and high-proof\r\nspirits.\"[26]\r\n\r\nWhat the Government authorities thought of all this is shown in a\r\nletter which is spread upon the records of the Treasury Department. It\r\nis addressed by the Commissioner of Internal-Revenue to the gauger.\r\nAfter thanking him for his \"highly commendable\" conduct in relation to\r\nthe bribe the Commissioner says to Mr. Thomas S. Dewar:\r\n\r\n \"While your rejection of the offer was just what was expected\r\n from you, considering your official and personal standing, yet I\r\n realize that you have done more than simply reject the offer. You so\r\n conducted the affair as to place the guilty party, it is hoped, in a\r\n position in which he will be punished for this violation of law. The\r\n proposition was not only to attempt to corrupt an honest officer of\r\n the Government, but was to induce you, by the offer of a large sum of\r\n money, to commit a most heinous and inhuman act.\"\r\n\r\nNo attempt was made by the representatives of the Trust before\r\nthe committee to deny this testimony. They simply disclaimed any\r\nresponsibility for what their associate and employé had done. \"Whatever\r\nthere was in that,\" testified the president of the Whiskey Trust, \"was\r\nwith the former secretary of this company, if there be anything of\r\nit.\"[27]\r\n\r\nThe Trust increased the number of plants under its control from\r\n\"nearly eighty\" to eighty-one or eighty-two, the number reported by\r\nthe investigation of Congress in 1893. Its annual production was then\r\n50,000,000 gallons; about 7,500,000 gallons of it alcohol, 42,500,000\r\nspirits. It is evident, says the report, that the company will soon\r\nhave within its grasp the entire trade, and be able to dictate prices\r\nto consumers at pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"How do you account for spirits going up and corn going down at the\r\nsame time in two or three instances?\" the treasurer was asked.\r\n\r\n\"Simply because the distillers were getting in a position whereby they\r\nran less than their capacity.\"[28]\r\n\r\nThe experience of mankind has always found, as Lord Coke pointed out,\r\nthat monopoly adulterates.\r\n\r\nThe report of Congress states that unquestionably the largest part of\r\nthe product of the combination finds its way into the open markets in\r\nthe form of \"compounded\"--or artificial--bourbon and rye whiskeys,\r\nbrandies, rums, gins, cordials. The testimony establishes the fact\r\nthat about one half of the whiskey consumed in the country is of\r\nthis compound product. These compounded liquors are supplied from\r\nthe drug-stores to the sick as medicine. One of the expert witnesses\r\nsummoned to explain the process of this adulteration appeared before\r\nthe committee with two demijohns, one containing pure alcohol and the\r\nother spirits, and a number of bottles containing essential oils,\r\nessences, etc., with which he proposed to make some experiments. \"The\r\nbasis here, this white product, is what is known as 'spirits' in the\r\ntrade. With the use of these essential oils and essences now before\r\nyou any kind of imitation liquor can be produced at almost a moment's\r\nnotice. My first experiment will be with Jamaica rum. I put a drop of\r\nJamaica-rum essence into this white spirits, a few drops of coloring\r\nmatter, and some sugar syrup. Try of it and smell of it. Does it\r\nsmell like rum and taste like it? If they want to make it cheaper,\r\nthey reduce it with water. I will reduce it with water, and you will\r\nnow notice that the bead has disappeared from it. I will reproduce\r\nthe bead by the use of bead oil. I put one drop in, and here is the\r\nresult. Now, using rye-whiskey essence instead of Jamaica-rum essence,\r\nI will flavor this spirits. I will now put some prune juice into it to\r\ntone it. I will put some raisin oil in it to age it, and I will now\r\ncommence to color it. This first exhibit\" (holding it up before the\r\ncommittee) \"is about the color of one-year-old whiskey that has been\r\nproperly bonded. I will now color it so it will imitate a two-year-old\r\nwhiskey. This is about the three-year-old now\" (exhibiting it). \"I will\r\nnow give this the color of 'velvet whiskey,' which is sold as high as\r\n$4 a gallon\" (exhibiting it). \"The present price of spirits, to-day,\r\nI think, is $1.30 a gallon. The utilization of any of these essential\r\noils and essences and coloring matter to make the transfer does not\r\nexceed a cost of one and a half cents a gallon. I am prepared to make\r\nimitations of any of these liquors at any time with this spirits\r\nbasis--all the different whiskeys, Scotch and Irish whiskeys, the\r\nforeign gins and rums and brandies, after-dinner cordials and liqueurs.\r\nThese materials as you have them exhibited before you of essential oils\r\nand essences are part and parcel of the stock in trade of every man\r\nin the United States of America who has got a rectifying license as a\r\nwholesale liquor dealer.... They are very generally and extensively in\r\nuse throughout our entire country, in every hamlet and village, in all\r\nthe branches of trade, the wholesale liquor dealer, the grocer having\r\na liquor dealer's license, and retail druggists.... When a doctor\r\nprescribes French brandy, he expects to get a production which is a\r\ndistillation of wine made from the grape. In that imitation brandy made\r\nfrom spirits and cognac oil he gets a crude product of corn, defeating\r\nentirely his purpose in the prescription. The same applies to gin, rum,\r\nand other articles wherever the imitations are found.\"[29]\r\n\r\nSome of the substances named by witnesses as occurring in the oils and\r\nessences used for this adulteration are sulphuric acid, prussic acid,\r\nfusel oil, creosote, nitro-benzol--all poisons, and some of them so\r\nvirulent that a teaspoonful would kill.\r\n\r\n\"I have been warned when in the employ of these people not to take\r\nthe crude material into my mouth,\" said one of the witnesses. Another\r\nwitness denied that there was any danger in the infinitesimal portions\r\nused of the flavoring matter.\r\n\r\n\"The only result,\" said one of the members of the committee, \"of the\r\ntestimony and hearing of the committee will be to educate the public to\r\nthe Trust methods. It will have no effect on the Trust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\"SQUARE EATERS\"\r\n\r\n\"By Heaven, square eaters, more meat I say!\"\r\n\r\n --_Beaumont and Fletcher._\r\n\r\n\r\nA delegate to one of the millers' national conventions said, \"We want\r\ncheaper wheat and dearer flour.\"\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Parliament reports that \"the Biscuit Association,\"\r\nwhich had been in existence six years, had kept up the prices of its\r\nproducts, \"although the prices of the ingredients used have in that\r\ntime very materially decreased.\"\r\n\r\nAn Associated Press despatch from Chicago announced that at \"a joint\r\nmeeting of all the cracker bakers between Pittsburg and the Rocky\r\nMountains, held this morning, it was unanimously agreed to advance the\r\nprice of crackers.\"\r\n\r\nA \"Bread Union\" has been formed in London for the amalgamation of\r\nconcerns controlling hundreds of shops. Its chairman instructed the\r\nstockholders that by concentrating a large number of shops under one\r\nmanagement in any district it could \"quickly stifle the opposition of\r\nany small unprincipled trader bent on reducing prices for competition\r\npurposes.\" The Dominion Parliament, in condemning the Grocers' Guild as\r\n\"obnoxious to the public interest in limiting competition, in enhancing\r\nprices,\" pointed out that \"no reasonable excuse exists for many of its\r\narbitrary acts and agreements. The wholesale grocery trade had been for\r\nmany years in a flourishing condition; failures were almost unknown.\"\r\n\r\nBut though prosperous the grocers formed this guild, admitting some,\r\nproscribing others, and established by private legislation the profits\r\nthey desired. The profits were \"afterwards increased, and in no\r\ninstance lowered, though values generally had fallen.\"\r\n\r\nAt Minneapolis, the seat of the greatest flour-manufacturing industry\r\nin the world, the elevators and railroads have united against the\r\nwheat-growers in a way which does much to realize the dream of the\r\nmiller, of \"cheaper wheat and dearer flour.\" A committee of the\r\nMinnesota legislature investigated this combination in 1892. The\r\nmajority stopped short of reporting that it fixed the prices of wheat,\r\nbut admitted that some of the testimony tended that way, and that\r\nthe evidence \"would seem to establish\" that one of the most powerful\r\nrailroads had done so, and \"had attempted to coerce compliance with\r\nits requirements in the matter of prices by threats to embarrass the\r\nbusiness of local buyers.\"[30] A report from a minority of the same\r\ncommittee was more outspoken. It summarizes the evidence, which shows\r\nthat the railroads and the elevator companies united to enforce a\r\nuniform price for wheat. This price was six and a quarter cents below\r\nwhat it should be. All the railroads adjusted their freight rates to\r\nthe artificial \"list-price,\" and though rivals, they all charged the\r\nsame rates. The elevator companies, owning an aggregate of fifteen\r\nhundred elevators, had a common agent who sent word daily, by telegram\r\nand letter, to all wheat-buyers as to the price to be paid the farmers.\r\nThe report calculates the amount thereby taken from the wheat-growers\r\nby the elevators at from four to five millions of dollars a year.\r\n\r\nThe findings of this report were ratified by the adoption of its\r\nsuggestions for a remedy. \"There is,\" it said, \"no agency but the State\r\nitself adequate to protect, now, the producer of wheat in Minnesota\r\nand the Northwest from the influence of this combine.\" It therefore\r\nrecommended the erection and operation of elevators by the State. This\r\nwas approved by the Legislature and by the Governor, appropriations\r\nwere made, and the officials of the State went forward with the plan\r\nuntil the Supreme Court of the State stopped them on the ground of\r\n\"unconstitutionality.\"\r\n\r\nThat which we see the national associations of winter-wheat millers and\r\nspring-wheat millers, and the fish, and the egg, and the fruit, and the\r\nsalt, and the preserves, and other combinations reaching out to do for\r\na \"free breakfast table,\" to put the \"square meal\" out of the reach of\r\nthe \"square eater,\" has been achieved to the last detail in sugar and\r\nmeat. Every half-cent up or down in the price of sugar makes a loss or\r\ngain to the sugar combination at the rate of $20,000,000 a year. When\r\nit was capitalized for $50,000,000 it paid dividends of $5,000,000 a\r\nyear. The value of the refineries in the combination was put by the New\r\nYork Legislative Investigation of 1891 at $7,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Wm. Wilson, of the committee of Congress investigating trusts\r\nin 1888, and the framer of the tariff bill of 1893, in a public\r\ncommunication quoted figures showing that this Trust had a surplus of\r\n$10,000,000 at the end of 1888, after paying its 10 per cent. dividend.\r\nThe profits for the next five and a half months were $13,000,000. This\r\nsurplus of one year and net profits of less than half a year together\r\namount to $23,000,000, nearly half the then nominal capital, and\r\nseveral times more than the real value of all the concerns, as given\r\nabove. These profits so conservative a paper as the New York _Daily\r\nCommercial Bulletin_ called \"plunder,\" and it reaffirmed that epithet\r\nwhen called to account. Stock was issued for this \"fabulous valuation\"\r\nof $50,000,000, put on this $7,000,000 of original value, and was made\r\none of the specialties of the stock market.\r\n\r\n\"There has been an enormous and widespread speculation in the\r\ncertificates of the trust,\" says the report of the New York Senate. \"It\r\nwas plainly one of the chief purposes of the trust to provide for the\r\nissue of these certificates, affording thereby an opportunity for great\r\nspeculation in them, obviously to the advantage of the persons managing\r\nthe trust. The issue of $50,000,000 certificates was amply sufficient\r\nfor a speculation of many hundreds of millions of dollars.\"[31]\r\n\r\nSince this investigation by the New York Legislature, the Sugar Trust\r\nhas been reorganized into a single corporation. The capital of this\r\nis $75,000,000, all \"water,\" since the value of the plants is fully\r\ncovered by the bonds to the amount of $10,000,000. The actual value of\r\nthe refineries in the Trust, excluding those which have been closed or\r\ndismantled, was investigated by the New York _World_, January 8, 1894,\r\nand put at $7,740,000. On this actual value of $7,740,000 in operation\r\nthe Trust paid in regular and extra dividends in 1893 no less than\r\n$10,875,000, and acknowledged that there was in addition a surplus of\r\n$5,000,000 in the treasury. This was in addition to the interest on the\r\n$10,000,000 of bonds.\r\n\r\nWhen a farmer sells a steer, a lamb, or a hog, and the house-keeper\r\nbuys a chop or roast, they enter a market which for the whole\r\ncontinent, and for all kinds of cattle and meats, is controlled by the\r\ncombination of packers at Chicago known as \"the Big Four.\"[32] This had\r\nits origin in the \"evening\" arrangement, made in 1873 by the railroads\r\nwith preferred shippers, on the ostensible ground that these shippers\r\ncould equalize or even the cattle traffic of the roads. They received\r\n$15 as \"a commission\" on every car-load of cattle shipped from the West\r\nto New York, no matter by whom shipped, whether they shipped it or had\r\nanything to do with it or not. The commission was later reduced to\r\n$10. They soon became large shippers of cattle; and with these margins\r\nin their favor \"evening\" was not difficult business.[33] By 1878 the\r\ndressed-beef business had become important. As the Evener Combine had\r\nconcentrated the cattle trade at Chicago, the dressed-beef interest\r\nnecessarily had its home at the same place. It is a curious fact that\r\nthe Evener Combine ceased about the time the dressed-beef interest\r\nbegan its phenomenal career.[34]\r\n\r\nThe committee appointed by the United States Senate to investigate\r\nthe condition of the meat and cattle markets fixed upon St. Louis,\r\nMo., and November 20, 1888, as the time and place of meeting, because\r\nthe International Cattle Range Association and the Butchers' National\r\nProtective Association assembled at the same time and place. It was\r\nsupposed that prominent members of these associations would avail\r\nthemselves of the opportunity to appear before the committee. Some of\r\nthem did testify frankly, but the presence of antagonistic influences,\r\nespecially in the International Cattle Range Association, immediately\r\nbecame apparent, and industrious efforts were made to prevent the\r\ninquiries of the committee from affecting injuriously the dressed-beef\r\ninterest at Chicago. The committee found that under the influence\r\nof the combination the price of cattle had gone down heavily. For\r\ninstance: In January, 1884, the best grade of beef cattle sold at\r\nChicago for $7.15 per hundred pounds, and in January, 1889, for $5.40;\r\nNorthwestern range and Texas cattle sold in January, 1884, at $5.60,\r\nand in January, 1889, at $3.75; Texas and Indian cattle sold in 1884 at\r\n$4.75, the price declining to $2.50 in December, 1889. These are the\r\nhighest Chicago prices for the months named.\r\n\r\n\"So far has the centralizing process continued that for all practical\r\npurposes,\" the report says, \"the market of that city dominates\r\nabsolutely the price of beef cattle in the whole country. Kansas\r\nCity, St. Louis, Omaha, Cincinnati, and Pittsburg are subsidiary to\r\nthe Chicago market, and their prices are regulated and fixed by the\r\ngreat market on the lake.\"[35] This great business is practically in\r\nthe hands of four establishments at Chicago. The largest houses have\r\na capacity for slaughtering 3,500 cattle, 3,000 sheep, and 12,000\r\nhogs every ten hours. When the Senate committee visited Chicago,\r\nit was found impossible to obtain the frank and full testimony of\r\neither the commission men doing business at the Union Stock Yards, or\r\nof the employés of the packing and dressed-beef houses. The former\r\ntestified reluctantly, and were unquestionably under some sort of\r\nconstraint as to their public declarations. In private they stated\r\nto the members of the committee that a combination certainly existed\r\nbetween the \"Big Four;\" but when put on the stand as witnesses they\r\nshuffled and prevaricated to such a degree as, in many cases, to excite\r\ncommiseration. The committee reported that the overwhelming weight of\r\ntestimony from witnesses of the highest character, and from all parts\r\nof the West, is to the effect that cattle-owners going with their\r\ncattle to the Chicago and Kansas City markets find no competition among\r\nbuyers, and if they refuse to take the first bid are generally forced\r\nto accept a lower one.\r\n\r\nAs to the effect upon retailers, local butchers, and consumers, it was\r\nadmitted by the biggest of the Big Four \"that they combined to fix\r\nthe price of beef to the purchaser and consumer, so as to keep up the\r\ncost in their own interest.\"[36] They combined in opening shops and\r\nunderselling the butchers of cattle at places all over the country, in\r\norder to force them to buy dressed meat. They combined in refusing to\r\nsell any meat to butchers at Washington, D.C., because the butchers\r\nhad bid against them for contracts to supply with meats the Government\r\ninstitutions in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe compulsion put upon local butchers is illustrated in the S----\r\ncase. The following telegram was sent from the office of one of the\r\ncombination at Chicago to an agent in Pennsylvania: \"Cannot allow\r\nS---- to continue killing live cattle. If he will not stop, make other\r\narrangements, and make prices so can get his trade.\"\r\n\r\nS---- was a local butcher. He testified that he was approached by\r\nthe agent with a proposition that he should sell dressed-beef. He\r\nrefused, and was then informed that he would be broken up in business.\r\nNotwithstanding this threat, he continued to butcher, and made his\r\npurchases of cattle at Buffalo. From the time of his refusal to sell\r\ndressed-beef as proposed, he could not buy any meat from Chicago,\r\nand could not get any cars from the Erie Railroad to ship his cattle\r\nfrom Buffalo. He was boycotted for his refusal to discontinue killing\r\ncattle.[37] One of the combination, when testifying to this matter,\r\ndisclaimed responsibility for the despatch, but stated that he did not\r\nthink a butcher should be permitted to kill cattle and at the same time\r\nsell dressed-beef. \"He could not serve both interests.\" \"We have no\r\nhesitation in stating as our conclusion, from all the facts,\" says the\r\nreport, \"that a combination exists at Chicago between the principal\r\ndressed-beef and packing houses, which controls the market and fixes\r\nthe price of beef cattle in their own interest.\"\r\n\r\nWhen pork is cheap, less beef is eaten. Beef monopoly must therefore\r\nwiden into pork monopoly. This has happened. There is a combination\r\nbetween the pork-packers at Chicago and the large beef-packers. It\r\nbegan in 1886. The existence of such an arrangement was admitted by its\r\nmost important member; and it is found to have seriously affected the\r\nprices of beef cattle, both to the producer and consumer. It was shown\r\nthat one of the companies of the Big Four made in 1889 profits equal\r\nto 29 per cent. on its capital stock--which may, or may not, have been\r\npaid in--and this was not the largest of the companies. As to the idea\r\nthat other capitalists might enter into competition with those now in\r\npossession, the report says: \"The enormous capital of the great houses\r\nnow dominating the market, which each year becomes larger, enables them\r\nto buy off all rivals.\"\r\n\r\nThe favoritism on the highways, in which this power had its origin in\r\n1873, has continued throughout to be its main stay. The railroads give\r\nrates to the dressed-beef men which they refuse to shippers of cattle,\r\neven though they ship by the train-load--\"an unjust and indefensible\r\ndiscrimination by the railroads against the shipper of live cattle.\"\r\nThe report says: \"This is the spirit and controlling idea of the great\r\nmonopolies which dominate the country.... No one factor has been more\r\npotent and active in effecting an entire revolution in the methods\r\nof marketing the meat supply of the United States than the railway\r\ntransportation.\"[38] There have been discriminations by the common\r\ncarriers of the ocean as well as by the railroads. The steamship\r\ncompanies exclude all other shippers, by selling all their capacity to\r\nthe members of the beef combine, sometimes for months in advance. It is\r\nuseless for any other shipper to apply.\r\n\r\nProperty is monopoly, the Attorney-General of the United States says.\r\nThose who own the bread, meat, sugar, salt, can fix the price at which\r\nthey will sell. They can refuse to sell. It is to these fellow-men we\r\nmust pray, \"Give us this day our daily bread.\" And when we have broken\r\nbread for the last time, we can get entrance to our \"long home\" only\r\nby paying \"exorbitant\" toll for our shrouds and our coffins to the\r\n\"Undertakers'\" and the \"National Burial Case\" associations.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSTRIKING OIL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an American idea to \"strike oil.\" Those who knew it as the\r\n\"slime\" of Genesis, or used it to stick together the bricks of the\r\nTower of Babel, or knelt to it in the fire temples, were content to\r\ntake it as it rose, the easy gift of nature, oozing forth on brook or\r\nspring. But the American struck it.\r\n\r\nThe world, going into partial eclipse on account of the failing supply\r\nof whale oil, had its lamps all ready for the new light, and industries\r\nbeyond number needed only an expansion of the supply.\r\n\r\nDe Witt Clinton, with the same genius that gave us the Erie Canal,\r\nsuggested as early as 1814 the use of petroleum for light. Reichenbach,\r\nthe great German chemist, predicted in 1830 that petroleum would yield\r\nan illuminating oil equal to the finest. Inventors and money-makers\r\nkept up close with scientific investigators in France, Great Britain,\r\nand America.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1845 the manufacture of coal-oil, both for light and\r\nother purposes, had become important in France. Selligue had made\r\nhimself master of the secrets of petroleum. His name, says one of his\r\nchroniclers, \"must forever remain inseparably connected with that of\r\nthe manufacture of light from oil, and to his researches few have been\r\nable to add.\"[40]\r\n\r\nThe name of this genius and benefactor of humanity has remained almost\r\nunknown, except within a small scientific world. He was a member of the\r\nFrench Academy, and almost every year between 1834 and 1848 he came to\r\nit with some new discovery. On one occasion he reminds his associates\r\nthat he holds a patent, granted in 1832, for making illuminating oil\r\nfrom coal, and declares that the business can be developed to any\r\nextent which commerce or the arts may require. By 1845 he had unlocked\r\nnearly every one of the hidden places in which this extraordinary\r\nproduct has stored its wonders. He found out how to make illuminating\r\noil, illuminating gas, lubricating oil, colors, paraffine for candles,\r\nfertilizers, solvents for resin for painters, healing washes,\r\nchemicals. He had three refineries in operation in the Department\r\nSaône-et-Loire, as described in the report of a committee of the French\r\nAcademy in 1840. He exhibited his oils in the London Exhibition of\r\n1851, and twelve years before, in the Parisian Industrial Exhibition of\r\n1839, he had crude and refined oils and paraffine to show. \"Among the\r\nmost important objects of the exhibition,\" said its German historian,\r\nVon Hermann, \"if they can be prepared economically.\" This Selligue\r\naccomplished. Between 1837 and 1843 he refined more than 4,000,000\r\npounds of oil, and 50 per cent. of his product was good illuminating\r\noil.\r\n\r\nBefore 1850, the Scotch had succeeded in getting petroleum, called\r\nshale oil, out of bituminous coal, had found how to refine it, and had\r\nperfected lamps in which it would burn. Joshua Merrill, the pioneer of\r\noil refining in this country, with his partners, successfully refined\r\npetroleum at Waltham, Mass., where they established themselves in 1853.\r\nThe American manufacturers were making kerosene as early as 1856 from\r\nScotch coal,[41] imported at a cost of $20 to $25 a ton, and getting\r\nexperts like Silliman to analyze petroleum, in the hope that somehow\r\na supply of it might be got. By 1860 there were sixty-four of these\r\nmanufactories in the United States. \"A crowd of obscure inventors,\"\r\nsays Felix Foucon, in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, \"with unremitting\r\nlabors perfected the lamp--when it was premature to dream that\r\nillumination by mineral oil should become universal.\" All was ready,\r\nas the eminent English geologist, Binney, said, \"for the start of the\r\nvast American petroleum trade.\" It was not a lack of knowledge, but\r\na lack of petroleum, that hampered the American manufacturer before\r\n1860.[42] The market, the capital, the consumer, the skilled labor, the\r\ninventions, and science were all waiting for \"Colonel\" Drake.\r\n\r\nWith Drake's success in \"striking oil\" came to an end the period,\r\nlasting thousands of years, of fire temples, sweep and bucket, Seneca\r\noil; and came to an end, also, the Arcadian simplicity of the old\r\ntimes--old though so recent--in which Professor Silliman could say, \"It\r\nis not monopolized by any one, but is carried away freely by all who\r\ncare to collect it.\"\r\n\r\nThe oil age begins characteristically. As soon as Drake's well had\r\nmade known its precious contents, horses began running, and telegrams\r\nflying, and money passing to get possession of the oil lands for the\r\nfew who knew from those who did not know. The primitive days when \"it\r\nwas not monopolized by any one\" were over. Thousands of derricks rose\r\nall over the territory, and oil scouts pushed with their compasses\r\nthrough the forests of the wilderness in all directions. Wells were\r\nbored all over Europe, as well as America, wherever traces of oil\r\nshowed themselves, sometimes so close together that when one was pumped\r\nit would suck air from the other.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the petroleum began to flow out of the ground, refineries\r\nstarted up at every available place. They were built near the wells,\r\nas at Titusville and Oil City, and near the centres of transportation,\r\nsuch as Pittsburg and Buffalo, and near the points of export, as\r\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, New York. Numbers of little establishments\r\nappeared on the Jersey flats opposite New York.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of oil for every one; at one time in 1862 it was only\r\nten cents a barrel. The means of refining it had long before been\r\nfound by science and were open to all; and even poor men building\r\nlittle stills could year by year add on to their works, increase their\r\ncapital, and acquire the self-confidence and independence of successful\r\nmen. The business was one of the most attractive possible to capital.\r\n\"There is no handsomer business than this is,\" said one of the great\r\nmerchants of New York. \"You can buy the (crude) oil one week, and sell\r\nit the next week refined, and you can imagine the quantity of business\r\nthat can be done.\" Men who understood the business, he said, \"if they\r\nhad not the capital could get all of the money they wanted.\"[43]\r\n\r\nWhatever new processes and contrivances were needed the fertile\r\nAmerican mind set about supplying. To carry the oil in bulk on the\r\nrailroads tubs on flat cars were first used; but it was not long before\r\nthe tub was made of iron instead of wood, and, laid on its side instead\r\nof bottom, became the tank of the cylinder car now so familiar.\r\n\r\nThe fluid which lubricates so many other things on their way through\r\nthe world is easily made to slip itself along to market. General S.D.\r\nKarns was the author,[44] in 1860, of the first suggestion of a pipe\r\nline. He planned only for oil to run down hill. Then Hutchinson, the\r\ninventor of the Hutchinson rotary pump, saw that oil could be forced\r\nthrough by pressure, and the idea of the pipe line was complete.\r\nThe first successful pipe line, put down by Samuel Van Syckel,[45]\r\nof Titusville, in 1865, from Pithole to Miller's Farm, four miles,\r\nhas grown into a net-work of thousands of miles, running through the\r\nstreets of towns, across fields and door-yards, under and over and\r\nbeside roads, with trunk lines which extend from the oil regions to\r\nPittsburg, Cleveland, Buffalo, Baltimore, New York, Williamsport,\r\nChicago, and the Ohio River.\r\n\r\nThere was a free market for the oil as it came out of the wells\r\nand out of the refineries, and free competition between buyers and\r\nsellers, producers and consumers, manufacturers and traders. Industries\r\nauxiliary to the main ones flourished. Everywhere the scene was of\r\nexpanding prosperity, with, of course, the inevitable percentage of\r\nill-luck and miscalculation; but with the balance, on the whole, of\r\nsuch happy growth as freedom and the bounty of nature have always\r\nyielded when in partnership. The valleys of Pennsylvania changed into\r\nbusy towns and oil fields. The highways were crowded, labor was well\r\nemployed at good wages, new industries were starting up on all sides,\r\nand everything betokened the permanent creation of a new prosperity for\r\nthe whole community, like that which came to California and the world\r\nwith the discovery of gold.\r\n\r\nBut shadows of sunset began to creep over the field in its morning\r\ntime, and the strange spectacle came of widespread ruin in an industry\r\nprospering by great leaps. Wherever men moved to discover oil lands, to\r\ndig wells, to build refineries or pipe lines, to buy and sell the oil,\r\nor to move it to market, a blight fell upon them.\r\n\r\nThe oil age began in 1860. As early as 1865 strange perturbations were\r\nfelt, showing that some undiscovered body was pulling the others out of\r\ntheir regular orbits.\r\n\r\nBefore the panic of 1873--days of buoyant general prosperity, with\r\nno commercial revulsion for a cause--the citizens of this industry\r\nbegan to suffer a wholesale loss of property and business among the\r\nrefineries in New York, Pittsburg, Cleveland, and elsewhere, the wells\r\nof the oil valleys, and the markets at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nTo the building of refineries succeeded the spectacle--a strange one\r\nfor so new a business--of the abandonment and dismantling of refineries\r\nby the score. The market for oil, crude and refined, which had been a\r\nnatural one, began to move erratically, by incalculable influences. It\r\nwent down when it should have gone up according to all the known facts\r\nof the situation, and went up when it should have gone down. This sort\r\nof experience, defying ordinary calculations and virtues, made business\r\nmen gamblers.\r\n\r\n\"We began speculating in the hope that there would be a change some\r\ntime or other for the better,\" testified one who had gone into the\r\nbusiness among the first, and with ample capital and expert skill.[46]\r\n\r\nThe fright among the people was proportionate to the work they had\r\ndone and the value of what they were losing. Since the first well was\r\nsunk the wilderness had become a busy region, teeming with activity\r\nand endowed with wealth. In ten years the business had sprung up from\r\nnothing to a net product of 6,000,000 barrels of oil a year, using a\r\ncapital of $200,000,000 and supporting a population of 60,000 people.\r\nThe people were drilling one hundred new wells per month, at an average\r\ncost of $6000 each. They had devised the forms, and provided the\r\nfinancial institutions needed in a new business. They invented many\r\nnew and ingenious mechanical contrivances. They had built up towns and\r\ncities, with schools, churches, lyceums, theatres, libraries, boards of\r\ntrade. There were nine daily and eighteen weekly newspapers published\r\nin the region and supported by it. All this had been created in ten\r\nyears, at a cost of untold millions in experiments and failures, and\r\nthe more precious cost of sacrifice, suffering, toil, and life.\r\n\r\nThe ripe fruit of all this wonderful development the men of the oil\r\ncountry saw being snatched away from them.[47]\r\n\r\nMore than once during these lean years, as more than once later, the\r\npublic alarm went to the verge of violent outbreak. This ruinous\r\nprosperity brought stolid Pennsylvania within sight of civil war\r\nin 1872, which was the principal subject before the Pennsylvania\r\nLegislature of that year, and forced Congress to make an official\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Legislature followed Congress and the Pennsylvania\r\nLegislature with an investigation in 1873.\r\n\r\n\"There was great popular excitement.... It raged like a violent fever,\"\r\nwas the description it heard of the state of things in Pennsylvania.[48]\r\n\r\nThere were panics in oil speculation, bank failures, defalcations.\r\nMany committed suicide. Hundreds were driven into bankruptcy and insane\r\nasylums.\r\n\r\nWhere every one else failed, out of this havoc and social disorder\r\none little group of half a dozen men were rising to the power and\r\nwealth which have become the marvel of the world. The first of them\r\ncame tardily into the field about 1862. He started a little refinery\r\nin Cleveland, hundreds of miles from the oil wells. The sixty and\r\nmore manufacturers who had been able to plant themselves before 1860,\r\nwhen they had to distil coal into petroleum before they could refine\r\npetroleum into kerosene, had been multiplied into hundreds by the\r\narrival of petroleum ready made from below. Some of the richest and\r\nmost successful business men of the country had preceded him and were\r\nflourishing.[49] He had been a book-keeper, and then a partner, in a\r\nvery small country-produce store in Cleveland. As described by his\r\ncounsel some years later, he was a \"man of brains and energy without\r\nmoney.\" With him were his brother and an English mechanic. The mechanic\r\nwas bought out later, as all the expert skill needed could be got for\r\nwages, which were cheaper than dividends.[50] Two or three years later\r\nanother partner was added, who began life as \"a clerk in a country\r\nstore,\"[51] and had been in salt and lumber in the West. A young\r\nman, who had been in the oil region only eleven years, and for two\r\nof the eleven had been errand-boy and book-keeper in a mixed oil and\r\nmerchandise business,[52] a lawyer, a railroad man, a cotton broker,\r\na farm laborer who had become refiner, were admitted at various times\r\ninto the ruling coterie.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which revolved all the freemen of this industry down\r\na vortex had no sooner begun than the public began to show its\r\nagitation through every organ. The spectacle of a few men at the\r\ncentre of things, in offices rich with plate glass and velvet plush,\r\nsinging a siren song which drew all their competitors to bankruptcy\r\nor insanity or other forms of \"co-operation,\" did not progress, as it\r\nmight have done a hundred years ago, unnoticed save by those who were\r\nthe immediate sufferers. The new democracy began questioning the new\r\nwealth. Town meetings, organizations of trades and special interests,\r\ngrand juries, committees of State legislatures and of the United States\r\nSenate and House of Representatives, the civil and criminal courts,\r\nhave been in almost constant action and inquiry since and because.\r\n\r\nIt was before the Committee of Commerce of the National House of\r\nRepresentatives in 1872 that the first authentic evidence was obtained\r\nof the cause of the singular ruin which was overwhelming so fair a\r\nfield. This investigation in 1872 was suppressed after it had gone\r\na little way. Congress said, Investigate. Another power said, Don't\r\ninvestigate. But it was not stopped until the people had found out that\r\nthey and the production, refining, and transportation of their oil--the\r\nwhole oil industry, not alone of the valleys where the petroleum was\r\nfound, but of the districts where it was manufactured, and the markets\r\nwhere it was bought and sold, and the ports from which it was shipped\r\nabroad--had been made the subject of a secret \"contract\"[53] between\r\ncertain citizens. The high contracting parties to this treaty for the\r\ndisposal of an industrial province were, on one side, all the great\r\nrailroad companies, without whose services the oil, crude or refined,\r\ncould not be moved to refineries, markets, or ports of shipment on\r\nriver, lake, or ocean. On the other side was a body of thirteen men,\r\n\"not one of whom lived in the oil regions, or was an owner of oil wells\r\nor oil lands,\" who had associated themselves for the control of the oil\r\nbusiness under the winning name of the South Improvement Company.[54]\r\n\r\nBy this contract the railroads had agreed with this company of citizens\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n1. To double freight rates.\r\n\r\n2. Not to charge them the increase.\r\n\r\n3. To give them the increase collected from all competitors.\r\n\r\n4. To make any other changes of rates necessary to guarantee their\r\nsuccess in business.\r\n\r\n5. To destroy their competitors by high freight rates.\r\n\r\n6. To spy out the details of their competitors' business.\r\n\r\nThe increase in rates in some cases was to be more than double.[55]\r\nThese higher rates were to be ostensibly charged to all shippers,\r\nincluding the thirteen members of the South Improvement Company; but\r\nthat fraternity only did not have to pay them really. All, or nearly\r\nall, the increase it paid was to be paid back again--a \"rebate.\"[56]\r\nThe increase paid by every one else--\"on all transported by other\r\nparties\"--was not paid back. It was to be kept, but not by the\r\nrailroads. These were to hand that, too, over to the South Improvement\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThis secret arrangement made the actual rate of the South Improvement\r\nCompany much lower--sometimes half, sometimes less than half, what all\r\nothers paid. The railroad officials were not to collect these enhanced\r\nfreight rates from the unsuspecting subjects of this \"contract\" to\r\nturn them into the treasury of the railroads. They were to give\r\nthem over to the gentlemen who called themselves \"South Improvement\r\nCompany.\" The \"principle\" was that the railroad was not to get the\r\nbenefit of the additional charge it made to the people. No matter how\r\nhigh the railroads put the rates to the community, not the railroads,\r\nbut the Improvement Company, was to get the gain. The railroads\r\nbound themselves to charge every one else the highest nominal rates\r\nmentioned. \"They shall not be less,\" was the stipulation. They might be\r\nmore up to any point; but less they must not be.[57]\r\n\r\nThe rate for carrying petroleum to Cleveland to be refined was to be\r\nadvanced, for instance, to 80 cents a barrel. When paid by the South\r\nImprovement Company, 40 cents of the 80 were to be refunded to it; when\r\npaid by any one else, the 40 cents were not merely not to be refunded,\r\nbut to be paid over to his competitor, this aspiring self-improvement\r\ncompany.[58] The charge on refined oil to Boston was increased to\r\n$3.07; and, in the same way, the South Improvement Company was to get\r\nback a rebate of $1.32 on every barrel it sent to Boston, and on every\r\nbarrel any one else sent. The South Improvement Company was to receive\r\nsums ranging from 40 cents to $1.32, and averaging a dollar a barrel on\r\nall shipments, whether made by itself or by others. This would give the\r\ncompany an income of a dollar a day on every one of the 18,000 barrels\r\nthen being produced daily, whether its members drilled for it, or piped\r\nit, or stored it, or refined it, or not.\r\n\r\nTo pay money to the railroads for them to pay back was seen to be a\r\nwaste of time, and it was agreed that the South Improvement Company\r\nfor its members should deduct from the ostensible rate the amount to\r\nbe refunded, and pay the railroads only the difference. Simplification\r\ncould not go further. The South Improvement Company was not even to be\r\nput to the inconvenience of waiting for the railroads to collect and\r\nrender to it the tribute exacted for its benefit from all the other\r\nshippers. It was given the right to figure out for its members what the\r\ntribute would amount to, and pay it to them out of the money they owed\r\nthe railroads for freight, and then pay the railroad what was left,\r\nif there was any left.[59] The railroads agreed to supply them with\r\nall the information needed for thus figuring out the amount of this\r\ntribute, and to spy out for them besides other important details of\r\ntheir competitors' business. They agreed to make reports every day to\r\nthe South Improvement Company of all the shipments by other persons,\r\nwith full particulars as to how much was shipped, who shipped, and to\r\nwhom, and so on.[60]\r\n\r\nThe detective agency thus established by the railroads to spy out\r\nthe business of a whole trade was to send its reports \"daily to\r\nthe principal office\" of the thirteen gentlemen. If the railroads,\r\nforgetting their obligations to the thirteen disciples, made any\r\nreduction in any manner to anybody else, the company, as soon as it was\r\nfound out, could deduct the same amount from its secret rate.[61] If\r\nthe open rate to the public went down, the secret rate was to go down\r\nas much. For the looks of things, it was stipulated that any one else\r\nwho could furnish an equal amount of transportation should have the\r\nsame rates;[62] but the possibility that any one should ever be able to\r\nfurnish an equal amount of transportation was fully taken care of in\r\nanother section clinching it all.\r\n\r\nThe railway managers, made kings of the road by the grant to them of\r\nthe sovereign powers of the State, covenanted, in order to make their\r\nfriends kings of light, that they would \"maintain the business\" of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company \"against loss or injury by competition,\" so\r\nthat it should be \"a remunerative\" and \"a full and regular business,\"\r\nand pledged themselves to put the rates of freight up or down, as\r\nmight be \"necessary to overcome such competition.\"[63] Contracts to\r\nthis effect, giving the South Improvement Company the sole right for\r\nfive years to do business between the oil wells and the rest of the\r\nworld, were made with it by the Erie, the New York Central, the Lake\r\nShore and Michigan Southern, the Pennsylvania, the Atlantic and Great\r\nWestern, and their connections, thus controlling the industry north,\r\nsouth, east, west, and abroad. The contracts in every case bound all\r\nthe roads owned or leased by the railroads concerned.[64] The contracts\r\nwere duly signed, sealed, and delivered. On the oil business of that\r\nyear, as one of the members of the committee of Congress figured out\r\nfrom the testimony, the railroad managers could collect an increase of\r\n$7,500,000 in freights, of which they were to hand over to the South\r\nImprovement Company $6,000,000, and pay into the treasury of their\r\nemployers--the railways--only $1,500,000.\r\n\r\nThe contract was signed for the New York Central and Hudson River\r\nRailroad by its vice-president, but this agreement to kill off a whole\r\ntrade was too little or too usual to make any impression on his mind.\r\nWhen publicly interrogated about it he could not remember having seen\r\nor signed it.[65]\r\n\r\n\"The effect of this contract,\" the vice-president of the Erie Railway\r\nCompany was asked, \"would have been a complete monopoly in the\r\noil-carrying trade?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; a complete monopoly.\"[66]\r\n\r\nOf the thirteen members of the South Improvement Company which was to\r\nbe given this \"complete monopoly,\" ten were found later to be active\r\nmembers of the oil trust. They were then seeking that control of the\r\nlight of the world which it has obtained. Among these ten were the\r\npresident, vice-president, treasurer, secretary, and a majority of\r\nthe directors of the oil trust into which the improvement company\r\nafterwards passed by transmigration. Any closer connection there could\r\nnot be. One was the other.\r\n\r\nThe ablest and most painstaking investigation which has ever been\r\nhad in this country into the management of the railroads found and\r\nofficially reported to the same effect:\r\n\r\n\"The controlling spirits of both organizations being the same.\"[67]\r\n\r\nThe freight rates were raised as agreed and without notice. Rumors had\r\nbeen heard of what was coming. The public would not believe anything so\r\nincredible. But the oil regions were electrified by the news, February\r\n26, that telegrams had been sent from railroad headquarters to their\r\nfreight agents advising them of new rates, to take effect immediately,\r\nmaking the cost of shipping oil as much again as it had been. The\r\npopular excitement which broke out on the same day and \"raged like a\r\nviolent fever\" became a national sensation. The Titusville _Morning\r\nHerald_ of March 20, 1872, announces that \"the railroads to the oil\r\nregions have already put up their New York freight from $1.25 to\r\n$2.84, an advance of over one hundred per cent.\" Asked what reason\r\nthe railroads gave for increasing their rates, a shipper said, \"They\r\ngave no reason; they telegraphed the local roads to put up the rates\r\nimmediately.\" This advance, the superintendents of the railroads told\r\ncomplaining shippers, had been made under the direction of the South\r\nImprovement Company, and they had been instructed to make their monthly\r\ncollections of oil freights from that concern.\r\n\r\nThe evidence even seems to show that the South Improvement Company was\r\nso anxious for the dance of death to begin that it got the freight\r\nagents by personal influence to order the increased rates before the\r\ntime agreed upon with the higher officials. Strenuous efforts were\r\nmade to have the public believe that the contracts, though sealed,\r\nsigned, delivered, and put into effect, as the advance in rates most\r\npractically demonstrated, had really not been put into effect. The\r\nquibbles with which the president of the South Improvement Company\r\nsought to give that impossible color to the affair before the committee\r\nof Congress drew upon him more than one stinging rebuke from the\r\nchairman of the committee.\r\n\r\n\"During your whole examination there has not been a direct answer given\r\nto a question.\" \"I wish to say to you,\" said the chairman, \"that such\r\nequivocation is unworthy of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe plea needs no answer, but if it did, the language of the\r\nrailroad men themselves supplies one that cannot be bettered. To the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, who had telegraphed them for information\r\n\"at once, as the excitement is intense, and we fear violence and\r\ndestruction of property,\" General McClellan, of the Atlantic and Great\r\nWestern, replied that the contract was \"cancelled;\" President Clark,\r\nof the Lake Shore, that it was \"formally abrogated and cancelled;\"\r\nChairman Homer Ramsdell, of the Erie, that it was \"abrogated;\"\r\nVice-president Thomas Scott, of the Pennsylvania Railroad, that it was\r\n\"terminated officially;\"[68] Vice-president Vanderbilt, of the New York\r\nCentral and Hudson River Railroad, that it was \"cancelled with all the\r\nrailroads.\"\r\n\r\nContracts that were not complete and in force would not need to be\r\n\"cancelled\" and \"abrogated\" and \"terminated.\" These announcements were\r\nbacked up by a telegram from the future head of the oil trust then\r\nincubating, in which he said of his company: \"This company holds no\r\ncontracts with the railroad companies.\"[69] But in 1879 its secretary,\r\ncalled upon by the Ohio Legislature to produce the contracts the\r\ncompany had with the railroads, showed, among others, one covering the\r\nvery date of this denial in 1872.[70]\r\n\r\nBefore Congress the South Improvement Company sought to shelter\r\nthemselves behind the plea that \"their calculation was to get all the\r\nrefineries in the country into the company. There was no difference\r\nmade, as far as we were concerned, in favor of or against any refinery;\r\nthey were all to come in alike.\"\r\n\r\nHow they \"were all to be taken in\" the contract itself showed. It bound\r\nthe South Improvement Company \"to expend large sums of money in the\r\npurchase of works for refining,\" and one of the reasons given by the\r\nrailroads for making the contract was \"to encourage the outlay.\" Upon\r\nwhat footing buyer and seller would meet in these purchases when the\r\nbuyer had a secret arrangement like this with the owners of the sole\r\nway to and from wells, refineries, and markets, one does not need to\r\nbe \"a business man\" to see. The would-be owners had a power to pry the\r\nproperty of the real owners out of their hands.\r\n\r\nOne of the Cleveland manufacturers who had sold was asked why he did so\r\nby the New York Legislature. They had been very prosperous, he said;\r\ntheir profits had been $30,000 to $45,000 a year; but their prosperity\r\nhad come to a sudden stop.[71]\r\n\r\n\"From the time that it was well understood in the trade that the South\r\nImprovement Company had ... grappled the entire transportation of\r\noil from the West to the seaboard ... we were all kind of paralyzed,\r\nperfectly paralyzed; we could not operate.... The South Improvement\r\nCompany, or some one representing them, had a drawback of a dollar,\r\nsometimes seventy cents, sometimes more, sometimes less, and we were\r\nworking against that difference.\"[72]\r\n\r\nIt was a difference, he said, which destroyed their business.\r\n\r\nHe went to the officials of the Erie and of the New York Central to try\r\nto get freight rates that would permit him to continue in business.\r\n\"I got no satisfaction at all,\" he said; \"I am too good a friend of\r\nyours,\" said the representative of the New York Central, \"to advise you\r\nto have anything further to do with this oil trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you pretend that you won't carry for me at as cheap a rate as you\r\nwill carry for anybody else?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am but human,\" the freight agent replied.\r\n\r\nHe saw the man who was then busily organizing the South Improvement\r\nCompany. He was non-committal. \"I got no satisfaction, except 'You\r\nbetter sell, you better get clear.' Kind of _sub rosa_: 'Better sell\r\nout, no help for it.'\"\r\n\r\nHis firm was outside the charmed circle, and had to choose between\r\nselling and dying. Last of all, he had an interview with the president\r\nof the all-conquering oil company, in relation to the purchase of their\r\nworks. \"He was the only party that would buy. He offered me fifty cents\r\non the dollar, on the construction account, and we sold out.... He made\r\nthis expression, I remember: 'I have ways of making money that you know\r\nnothing of.'\"\r\n\r\nFor the works, which were producing $30,000 to $45,000 a year profit,\r\nand which they considered worth $150,000, they received $65,000.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ascertain in the trade,\" he was asked, \"what was the average\r\nrate that was paid for refineries?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was about the figure.... Fifty cents on the dollar.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was that or nothing, was it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"That or nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe freight rates had been raised in February. This sale followed in\r\nthree weeks.\r\n\r\n\"I would not have sold out,\" he told the Legislature, \"if I could have\r\ngot a fair show with the railways. My business, instead of being an\r\nenterprise to buy and sell, became degraded into running after the\r\nrailways and getting an equal chance with others.\"[73]\r\n\r\n\"The only party that would buy\" gave his explanation a few years later\r\nof the centralization of this business.\r\n\r\n\"Some time in the year 1872,\" he swore, \"when the refining business of\r\nthe city of Cleveland was in the hands of a number of small refiners,\r\nand was unproductive of profit,[74] it was deemed advisable by many of\r\nthe persons engaged therein, for the sake of economy, to concentrate\r\nthe business, and associate their joint capital therein. The state\r\nof the business was such at that time that it could not be retained\r\nprofitably at the city of Cleveland, by reason of the fact that points\r\nnearer the oil regions were enjoying privileges not shared by refiners\r\nat Cleveland, and could produce refined oil at a much less rate than\r\ncould be done at this point. It was a well-understood fact at that\r\ntime among refiners that some arrangement would have to be made to\r\neconomize and concentrate the business, or ruinous losses would not\r\nonly occur to the refiners themselves, but ultimately Cleveland, as a\r\npoint of refining oil, would have to be abandoned. At that time those\r\nmost prominently engaged in the business here consulted together, and\r\nas a result thereof several of the refiners conveyed\" to his company,\r\nthen as always the centre of the centralization, \"their refineries, and\r\nhad the option, in pay therefor, to take stock\" in this company, \"at\r\npar, or to take cash.\" This company, he continued, \"had no agency in\r\ncreating this state of things which made that change in the refining\r\nbusiness necessary at that time, but the same was the natural result\r\nof the trade, nor did it in the negotiations which followed use any\r\nundue or unfair means, but in all cases, to the general satisfaction of\r\nthose whose refineries were acquired, the full value thereof, either in\r\nstock or cash, was paid as the parties preferred.\"[75]\r\n\r\nThe producers were not to fare any better than the refiners. The\r\npresident of the South Improvement Company said to a representative of\r\nthe oil regions substantially: \"We want you producers to make out a\r\ncorrect statement of the average production of each well, and the exact\r\ncost per barrel to produce the oil. Then we propose to allow you a fair\r\nprice for the oil.\"\r\n\r\nWithin forty-eight hours after the freight rates were raised, according\r\nto programme, \"the entire business of the oil regions,\" the Titusville\r\n_Herald_, March 20, 1872, reported, \"became paralyzed. Oil went down\r\nto a point seventy cents below the cost of production. The boring of\r\nnew wells is suspended, existing wells were shut down. The business in\r\nCleveland stopped almost altogether. Thousands of men were thrown out\r\nof work.\"\r\n\r\nThe people rose. Their uprising and its justification were described\r\nto the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of 1873 by a brilliant\r\n\"anti-monopolist,\" \"a rising lawyer\" of Franklin, Venango Co.\r\nThe principal subject to which he called the attention of his\r\nfellow-members was the South Improvement Company, and the light it\r\nthrew on the problems of livelihood and liberty. Quoting the decision\r\nof the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the Sanford case,[76] he said:\r\n\r\n \"That is the law in Pennsylvania to-day. But in spite of this\r\n decision, and in spite of the law, we well know that almost every\r\n railroad in this State has been in the habit, and is to-day in the\r\n habit, of granting special privileges to individuals, to companies in\r\n which the directors of such railroads are interested, to particular\r\n business, and to particular localities. We well know that it is their\r\n habit to break down certain localities, and build up others, to break\r\n down certain men in business and to build up others, to monopolize\r\n certain business themselves by means of the numerous corporations\r\n which they own and control, and all this in spite of the law, in\r\n defiance of the law.\r\n\r\n \"The South Improvement Company's scheme would give that corporation\r\n the monopoly of the entire oil business of this State, amounting to\r\n $20,000,000 a year. That corporation was created by the Pennsylvania\r\n Legislature along with at least twenty others, under the name\r\n of improvement companies, within a few years past, all of which\r\n corporations contain the names as original corporators of men who may\r\n be found in and about the office of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company,\r\n in Philadelphia, when not lobbying at Harrisburg. The railroads\r\n took but one of those charters which they got from the Legislature,\r\n and by means of that struck a deadly blow at one of the greatest\r\n interests of the State. Their scheme was contrary to law, but before\r\n the legal remedy could have been applied, the oil business would\r\n have lain prostrate at their feet, had it not been prevented by an\r\n uprising of the people, by the threatenings of a mob, if you please,\r\n by threatening to destroy property, and by actually commencing to\r\n destroy the property of the railroad company, and had the companies\r\n not cancelled the contract which Scott and Vanderbilt and others had\r\n entered into, I venture to say there would not have been one mile of\r\n railroad track left in the County of Venango--the people had come to\r\n that pitch of desperation.... Unless we can give the people a remedy\r\n for this evil of discriminations in freight, they will sooner or later\r\n take the remedy into their own hands.\"[77]\r\n\r\nSoon after this attorney for the people was promoted from the poor\r\npay of patriotism to a salary equal to that of the President of the\r\nUnited States, and to the place of counsel for the principal members of\r\nthe combination, whose inwardness he had descried with such hawk-eye\r\npowers of vision. Later, as their counsel, he drafted the famous trust\r\nagreement of 1882.\r\n\r\nThe South Improvement Company was formed January 2d. The agreement\r\nwith the railroads was evidently already worked out in its principal\r\ndetails, for the complicated contracts were formally signed, sealed,\r\nand delivered January 18th. The agreed increase of freights went into\r\neffect February 26th. The pacific insurrection of the people began\r\nwith an impromptu mass-meeting at Titusville the next day, February\r\n27th. Influential delegations, or committees, on transportation,\r\nlegislation, conference with press, pipe lines, arresting of drilling,\r\netc., were set to work by the organization thus spontaneously formed\r\nby the people. A complete embargo was placed on sales of oil at any\r\nprice to the men who had made the hateful bargain with the railroads.\r\nThe oil country was divided into sixteen districts, in each of which\r\nthe producers elected a local committee, and over all these was\r\nan executive committee composed of representatives from the local\r\ncommittees--one from each. No oil was sold to be used within any\r\ndistrict except to those buyers whom the local committee recommended;\r\nno oil was sold to be exported or refined outside the district, except\r\nto such buyers as the executive committee permitted. One cent a barrel\r\nwas paid by each producer into a general fund for the expenses of the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nSteps were taken to form a company with a capital of $1,000,000,\r\nsubscribed by the producers, to advance money, on the security of their\r\noil, to those producers who did not want to sell.\r\n\r\nAble lawyers were employed and sent with the committees to all the\r\nimportant capitals--Harrisburg, Washington, the offices of the railway\r\ncompanies. The flow of oil was checked, the activities of the oil world\r\nbrought near a stop.\r\n\r\nMonday, March 15th, by the influence of the Washington committee,\r\na resolution was introduced into the House of Representatives by\r\nRepresentative Scofield, ordering an investigation of the South\r\nImprovement Company. Immediately upon this the frightened participants\r\ncancelled the contracts. By the 26th of March the representatives\r\nof the people had secured a pledge in writing from the five great\r\nrailroads concerned of \"perfect equality,\" and \"no rebates, drawbacks,\r\nor other arrangements,\" in favor of any one thereafter. March 30th,\r\nCongress began the investigation which brought to light the evidence\r\nof the contracts, and meanwhile the committees on legislation and pipe\r\nlines were securing from the Pennsylvania Legislature the repeal of\r\nthe South Improvement Company charter, and the passage of a \"so-called\"\r\nFree Pipe Line law, discovered afterwards to be worthless on account of\r\namendments shrewdly inserted by the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was an uprising of the people, passionate but intelligent and\r\nirresistible, if the virtue of the members held good. Until April 9th\r\nthe non-intercourse policy was stiffly and successfully maintained. But\r\nby that time one man had been found among the people who was willing\r\nto betray the movement. This man, in consideration of an extra price,\r\nviolating his producer's pledge, sold to some of those concerned in\r\nthe South Improvement Company a large quantity of oil, as they at once\r\ntook pains to let the people know. The seller hoped to ship it quietly,\r\nbut, of course, the object in buying and paying this additional price\r\nwas to have it shipped openly, and the members of the South Improvement\r\nCompany insisted that it should be done so.[78]\r\n\r\nThis treachery had the effect planned. Every one became suspicious\r\nthat his neighbor would be the next deserter, and would get the price\r\nhe would like to have for himself. To prevent a stampede, the leaders\r\ncalled a mass-meeting. Reports were made to it of what had been done in\r\nCongress, the Legislature, and the other railway offices; the telegrams\r\nalready referred to were read affirming the cancellation of the\r\ncontracts. Amid manifestations of tumultuous approbation and delight\r\nthe embargo on the sale of oil was declared raised.\r\n\r\n\"We do what we must,\" says Emerson, \"and call it by the best name\r\npossible.\" The people, as every day since has shown, grasped the shell\r\nof victory to find within the kernel of defeat.\r\n\r\nThe committee of Congress noticed when the contracts were afterwards\r\nshown to it, that though they had been so widely declared to be\r\n\"cancelled,\" they had not been cancelled, but were as fresh--seals,\r\nstamps, signatures and all--as the day they were made. This little\r\ncircumstance is descriptive of the whole proceeding. Both parties\r\nto this scheme to give the use of the highways as a privilege to a\r\nfew, and through this privilege to make the pursuit of livelihood a\r\nprivilege, theirs exclusively--the railroad officials on one side, and\r\ntheir beneficiaries of the South Improvement Company on the other--were\r\nresolute in their determination to carry out their purpose. All that\r\nfollows of this story is but the recital of the sleuth-like tenacity\r\nwith which this trail of fabulous wealth has been followed.\r\n\r\nThe chorus of cancellation from the railroads came from those who\r\nhad meant never to cancel, really. In their negotiations with the\r\nrepresentatives of the people they had contested to the last the\r\nabandonment of the scheme. \"Their friendliness\" to it \"was so\r\napparent,\" the Committee of the Producers reported, \"that we could\r\nexpect little consideration at their hands,\"[79] and the committee\r\nbecame satisfied that the railroads had made a new contract among\r\nthemselves like that of the South Improvement Company, and to take\r\nits place. Its head frankly avowed before the Investigating Committee\r\nof Congress their intention of going ahead with the plan. \"They are\r\nall convinced that, sooner or later, it will be necessary to organize\r\nupon the basis on which the South Improvement Company was organized,\r\nincluding both producers and refiners.\"\r\n\r\nThis conviction has been faithfully lived up to. Under the name of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company the arrangement was ostentatiously abandoned,\r\nbecause to persist in it meant civil war in the oil country as the\r\nrising young anti-monopolist lawyer pointed out in the Constitutional\r\nConvention. Mark Twain, in describing the labors of the missionaries\r\nin the Sandwich Islands, says they were so successful that the vices\r\nof the natives no longer exist in name--only in reality. As every page\r\nwill show, this contract no longer exists in name--only in reality.\r\nIn the oil world, and in every other important department of our\r\nindustrial life--in food, fuel, shelter, clothing, transportation,[80]\r\nthis contract, in its various new shapes, has been kept steadily at\r\nwork gerrymandering the livelihoods of the people.\r\n\r\nThe men who had organized the South Improvement Company paid the public\r\nrevolt the deference of denial, though not of desistance. The company\r\nhad got a charter, organized under it, collected twenty per cent. of\r\nthe subscription for stock, made contracts with the railroads, held\r\nmeetings of the directors, who approved of the contracts and had\r\nreceived the benefits of the increase of freights made in pursuance of\r\nthe agreement. This was shown by the testimony of its own officers.[81]\r\n\r\nBut \"the company never did a dollar's worth of business,\" the Secretary\r\nof the Light of the World told Congress,[82] and \"there was never the\r\nslightest connection between the South Improvement Company and the\r\nStandard Oil Company,\" the president of the latter and the principal\r\nmember of both said in an interview in the New York _World_, of March\r\n29, 1890. \"The South Improvement Company died in embryo. It was never\r\ncompletely organized, and never did any business. It was partly born,\r\ndied, and was buried in 1872,\" etc.\r\n\r\nStill later, before a committee of the Legislature of New York, in\r\n1888, he was asked about \"the Southern Improvement Company.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was such a company?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of such a company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you not in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not.\"[83]\r\n\r\nSo help me God!\r\n\r\nAt almost the moment of this denial in New York, an associate in this\r\nand all his other kindred enterprises, asked before Congress who made\r\nup the South Improvement Company, named as among them the principal\r\nmembers of the great oil company, and most conspicuous of them all was\r\nthe name of this denier.[84]\r\n\r\nThe efficiency with which this \"partly born\" innocent lived his little\r\nhour, \"not doing a dollar's worth of business,\" was told in a summary\r\nphrase by one of the managers of the Pennsylvania Railroad, describing\r\nthe condition of the oil business in 1873:[85]\r\n\r\n\"All other of our largest customers had failed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the people of the oil regions made peace after their uprising it\r\nwas, as they say, with \"full assurance from the Washington committee\r\nthat the throwing off the restrictions from trade will not embarrass\r\ntheir investigation (by Congress), but that the Sub-Committee of\r\nCommerce will, nevertheless, continue, as the principle involved, and\r\nnot this particular case alone, is the object of the investigation.\"[86]\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Commerce did not \"continue.\" The principal witness,\r\nwho had negotiated the contracts by which the railroads gave over\r\nthe business of the oil regions to a few, refused in effect, beyond\r\nproducing copies of the contract, to be a witness. Permission was given\r\nby the Committee of Congress during its first zeal to the Committee\r\nof Producers from Pennsylvania to copy the testimony as it was taken,\r\nbut no official record of its discoveries exists. This transcript was\r\npublished by the producers, and copies are possessed by a few fortunate\r\ncollectors. The committee did not report, and in the archives of the\r\nnational Capitol no scrap of the evidence taken is to be found. All has\r\nvanished into the bottomless darkness in which the monopoly of light\r\nloves to dwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\"NOT TO EXCEED HALF\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the ceremonial treaty of equal rights on the railroads\r\nto all, which had been secured by the uprising of the people against\r\nthe South Improvement Company in 1872, the independents, one after the\r\nother, continued to be side-tracked by an unseen power. Four years\r\nlater, on the 20th of July, 1876, their only two important survivors in\r\nCleveland, frightened by the high death-rate of the business, and by\r\na deepening pressure on themselves, answered a summons to come to the\r\npalace of the President of the Light of the World. The contract which\r\nwas then made was afterwards produced in court.[87] It was called an\r\n\"Agreement for an Adventure,\" in something like \"the merry sport\" in\r\nwhich the good Antonio gave a bond for a pound of his flesh.\r\n\r\nA few years after this \"adventure\" with his competitors and his efforts\r\nto have them closed by the courts, the President was asked if his trust\r\nhad sought in any way to diminish the production of refineries in\r\ncompetition with it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, sir,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, sir.\"[88]\r\n\r\nHe was asked the question again, and again the denial was repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Done nothing of the sort?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.\"\r\n\r\nBut now he said, You must bind yourselves for ten years to refine only\r\n85,000 barrels of oil a year.[89]\r\n\r\nThey had refined 120,000 barrels the year before, and could have done\r\n180,000, and were growing up with the country. \"The prospects were much\r\nbetter for the future.\"[90]\r\n\r\nBut they agreed.\r\n\r\nYou must give me and my associates all the profits you make during this\r\nperiod above $35,000 a year, until we too have got $35,000 a year out\r\nof your business, and we will guarantee you $35,000 a year, if we let\r\nyou run.\r\n\r\nThey had made $41,000 the year before, but they agreed.\r\n\r\nYou must divide with \"us,\" after each has got $35,000 a year, all the\r\nadditional profits.\r\n\r\nThey had to put into this \"adventure\" all their buildings and\r\nmachinery, valued at $61,760.42, all their time and attention, and\r\n$10,000 in cash, while their conquerors put in only $10,000 cash and no\r\nplant and no time. But they agreed to this demand for \"half.\"\r\n\r\nYou must stop refining altogether, and let us take out our $10,000\r\nwhenever we send you notice that through competition, or a decrease or\r\nchange in the production of petroleum, Cleveland can \"barely compete\"\r\nwith other places. You must sell the kerosene you manufacture, and buy\r\nthe petroleum you make it of at the prices we fix.\r\n\r\nThe combination could make the business unprofitable whenever it chose,\r\nand under the previous stipulation could close them up at its own\r\npleasure, until the ten years had rolled by. But they agreed.\r\n\r\nYou must resume again after any such suspension, and let us take half\r\nthe profits whenever we give you notice. You must let us enter or\r\nwithdraw, throw our $10,000 in or out, suspend or resume, again and\r\nagain, as we choose! They agreed.\r\n\r\nYou must make us monthly reports of all your transactions. You must not\r\nenlarge nor contract your works without our consent. They agreed.\r\n\r\nYou must not go into the manufacture of petroleum, nor any other new\r\nbusiness anywhere else in the world during this adventure! You must\r\nship your products by such routes as we direct! They agreed.\r\n\r\nYou must keep this adventure secret. Our name must not appear, and even\r\nif you all die, you must agree that we may continue the business in\r\nyour name, or any other name we choose.\r\n\r\n\"The firm name,\" as their counsel pointed out, \"was to be kept up even\r\nwhen the members were mouldering in their graves. But the public were\r\nto understand that the business of that firm, as it had been conducted\r\nin the lifetime of those men, was still being carried on.\"\r\n\r\nYou are to be thus tied up for ten years, limited at the best to half\r\nthe profit on half your capacity, with a right in us to close you up\r\naltogether, or to close and resume whenever we choose, with no right in\r\nyou to start or stop or withdraw. But we are to be left free, in our\r\nown refineries, to refine all the oil the market will take, and keep\r\nall the profit, and enlarge our works and extend our business.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, you must put your hand and seal to a statement that you\r\ndo this to \"reconcile interests that have seemed to conflict\" and\r\n\"equalize the business,\" and that this agreement gives you your \"due\r\nproportion thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"free contract\" two of the three men who were to make it knew\r\nnothing of until their consent was demanded.\r\n\r\nOne of the partners had secretly been won over. Through him all\r\npreliminary negotiations had been conducted.\r\n\r\n\"I was not consulted,\" testified one of the other two, until after the\r\ncontract was \"all drawn and prepared,\" and at first he refused to sign\r\nit. The plan was concocted \"secretly and unknown to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was at first opposed to the arrangement,\" declared the other.[91]\r\n\r\nBut this was not all the contract. The President, who, as he\r\ntestified, \"conducted most of the negotiations,\" and \"had been familiar\r\nwith the dealings thereunder,\" supplemented the written documents with\r\noral instructions:[92]\r\n\r\nYou must not seem to be prosperous. You must not put on style,[93] he\r\ncautioned them; above all, you must not drive fast horses or have fine\r\nrigs; you must not even let your wives know of this arrangement.[94]\r\n\r\nA false account was opened on the books to conceal the nature and\r\norigin of this transaction from their own book-keepers. In the name of\r\nthat account false and fictitious checks were drawn, bills made out,\r\nbalances struck. A box was taken out at the Cleveland post-office--box\r\n125--in the name of an imaginary \"Mr. G.A. Mason,\" and through this\r\nbox the correspondence of the \"adventure\" was carried on. Each of the\r\nthree parties to the \"adventure\" continued to march and fight under\r\nits own flag as before. All possible pains were taken to conceal the\r\nfact that they had ceased competition with each other. They kept up\r\nevery appearance to the public of being actively engaged in competitive\r\nbusiness. The inevitable spy appears in this scene as in every other\r\nin the play. The \"reconciler,\" to enforce the provisions that the\r\n\"reconcilees\" should not engage in business elsewhere, extended a\r\nsystem of espionage over them, and followed their movements, and kept\r\nwatch what they did with their money, and made oath to the courts of\r\nthe results of these \"inquiries and investigations.\" The espionage\r\ncontinued after this.\r\n\r\nA year or two after this contract had been broken by the help of\r\nthe courts, the then secretary of the great oil company, through an\r\nintermediary, approached the book-keeper of the firm which had been\r\nfreed from the trust.\r\n\r\n\"Would you not like to make some money?\"\r\n\r\n\"He inclined to let him believe he did want to make some money,\" his\r\nemployer afterwards told Congress. \"He came and told me about it. I\r\nrequested that he continue and find out what information they wanted.\r\nHe was to have had so much per year, but he was to have been paid a\r\ndown payment; he got $25.\"\r\n\r\n\"What service was he to render for that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a memorandum. There were so many things he was to do that I\r\ncannot carry it in my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the questions was, 'What was the result of last year's\r\nbusiness?' The other was, 'A transcript of the daily shipments, with\r\nnet prices received from the same; what is the cost for manufacturing\r\noutside of the crude; the kind of gasoline and naphtha made, and\r\nthe net prices received for the same; what they do with tar and the\r\npercentages of the same; what per cent. of water white and what per\r\ncent. of Michigan water white; how much oil exported last year?' This\r\ninformation, as fast as received, to be mailed to Box 164, Cleveland\r\npost-office.... He (the book-keeper) made an affidavit of it, and I\r\ntook the money back myself personally.\"[95]\r\n\r\nWhen orders came in for more oil than the limit put upon them, the\r\n\"reconcilees,\" asserting their commercial manhood, went on refining\r\nto supply the demands of the public instead of the commands of the\r\nclique. They contended that they were not bound by the limitation, and\r\nin this were afterwards upheld by the court; but, meanwhile, they were\r\ncalled to account and frightened into another \"reconciliation.\" He was\r\npresent, the chief reconciler told the court, at the interview in which\r\nthey \"agreed to diminish their manufacture ... to bring the entire\r\namount within the terms\" of the contract.\r\n\r\nBut again they began to refine to supply the needs of the people\r\nevidenced by the market demand. Then their supply of crude was shut\r\noff. Their suzerain owned the pipe line to Cleveland. When its escaping\r\nvictims got around that difficulty, it took its \"contract\" to the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nTo shut these competitors down to half their capacity, and to reconcile\r\nand equalize interests by taking half of all they made on that was\r\nmerely an incident, collateral to the grander plan, the vaster\r\n\"adventure,\" of getting all the profits of that greater field out\r\nof which these competitors were barred altogether. Such contracts as\r\nthese, its counsel said, were made with refiners all over the country.\r\nThe chief profit of the adventure lay, not in the divided profits of\r\nthe picayune business it let the vassals do, but in the undivided\r\nprofits of the empire kept for itself. Why should the reconciler hurry\r\nwith expensive lawyers into court for a summary injunction to prevent a\r\n\"reconcilee\" from making more oil, when the reconciler, who toiled not\r\nnor spun, was to get half of the gain of $2.05 on every barrel of it?\r\nWhy, but that every \"co-operative\" barrel so made would displace in the\r\nmarkets a barrel, all the profits of which went to it.\r\n\r\nThe \"reconcilees\" were called into court. A judge was asked to issue\r\nan injunction forbidding them to depart from the strict letter of the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nThey have been refining more than 85,000 barrels of oil a year, was the\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nThey \"threaten to distil crude petroleum without regard to\r\nquantity.\"[96] They are \"parties in rebellion,\" said the lawyers. The\r\njudge said, No. This is a contract in restraint of trade, and released\r\nthose who were in its toils.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of this \"equalization\" was an advance in the rates\r\nof profit. The year before the independent refiners had made a profit\r\nof only 34 cents a barrel.[97]\r\n\r\nThe first year of the \"adventure\" the profits jumped up to $2.52\r\na barrel. The dividends rose from $41,000 to $222,047, while the\r\nproduction fell from 120,000 to 88,085 barrels. For the four years the\r\naverage profit was $2.05 a barrel, or 500 per cent. advance. The lowest\r\nprofit was $1.37.\r\n\r\n\"Refined oil advanced to an average of $8 per barrel for that year\"\r\n(1876), says the counsel of the trust.[98]\r\n\r\nThese great winnings were made in the depth of the depression following\r\nthe panic of 1873.\r\n\r\nWhile a world-compelling decline not only of prices but of profits,\r\nwas in progress, the authors of this arrangement kept up kerosene to a\r\npoint at which $630,691 was made in four years out of an investment of\r\n$81,000, half of which went to those who put in $10,000 and their power\r\nover freight agents.\r\n\r\nThis \"adventure,\" as was said by the Hon. Stanley Matthews, who\r\nappeared as counsel for the victimized refiners, was better than a\r\ngold-mine. It was a mint. Without giving any personal supervision or\r\nany time, without any expenditure except the insignificant investment\r\nof $10,000, made as a mere stalking-horse, these men took a share of\r\nthe profits of \"the party of the second part,\" which is not to be\r\ncalculated by ordinary percentage, but by multiplications, over and\r\nover again, every year, of the money they put in it.\r\n\r\nBy reducing the volume of business one-half, by increasing the profit\r\nfrom 34 cents a barrel to $2.05, the reconcilers pocketed $315,345.58\r\nin four years, on an investment of $10,000, with no work. This was the\r\nfact. The theory with which the fact was hidden from the people is\r\ngiven to the New York Legislature in 1888. The principle on which the\r\ntrust did business, its president said, was:\r\n\r\n\"At a limited profit; a very small profit on an extremely large volume\r\nof business.\"[99]\r\n\r\nWhen its secretary was before Congress, he was asked about the\r\noperations of himself and his associates in these years, 1876, 1877, of\r\nwonderful profits. He had been participating during that time in not\r\nonly this profit of $2.05 a barrel, but in divided profits rising to\r\n$3,000,000 in a year on $3,000,000 of capital, and in undivided profits\r\nwhich rolled up $3,500,000 of capital into $70,000,000 in five years.\r\nBut he said:\r\n\r\n\"The business during those years was so very close as to leave scarcely\r\nany margin of profit under the most advantageous circumstances.\"[100]\r\n\r\nThe effect on the consumer appears from the statement in this case of\r\none of the best-known producers and refiners in the oil regions, one\r\nintimately associated with the members of the combination. He showed\r\nthat oil which was selling at twenty cents a gallon retail could be\r\nsold at a large profit at twelve cents a gallon.\r\n\r\nAs to the effect on the working-man, the demand for labor declined,\r\nwages went down, and the number of unemployed increased.\r\n\r\nWhen there was competition in Cleveland the great company could not\r\nafford to have its skilled workmen idle, because they would seek\r\nemployment with the other refineries; but now, having the refining\r\nbusiness all in its own hands, when it was temporarily to its advantage\r\nto refine oil in Pittsburg, Oil City, or other points, in preference\r\nto Cleveland, it could with impunity let its hands remain idle in\r\nCleveland, knowing that when it wanted them it could easily secure\r\nthem, as there are no other refineries in Cleveland to employ them, and\r\n\"that has been a very serious injury to working-men.\"[101]\r\n\r\nThere was no pretence that the design of this contract was not to make\r\noil scarce--_i.e._, dear.\r\n\r\nIn the affidavit which was made in support of the injunction the\r\nprincipal reconciler showed that his company had restricted itself\r\nas much as it restricted these competitors. He urged as the reason\r\nwhy the contract had been made and why the courts should sustain it,\r\nthat \"the capacity of all the refineries in the United States is\r\nmore than sufficient to supply the markets of the world, and if all\r\nthe refineries were run to their full capacity they would refine at\r\nleast twice as much oil as the markets of the world require; that\r\nthis difference between the capacity of refineries and the demands of\r\nthe market has existed for at least seven years past, and during that\r\nperiod the refineries\" of his company \"have not been run to ... exceed\r\none-half of their capacity.\"\r\n\r\nWhen these surviving independents of Cleveland were forced into this\r\nadventure, in 1876, the source of the power which could compel \"free\"\r\ncitizens in this age of individualism to execute such a bond was not\r\nknown. The appalling mortality among the independents showed that\r\nsomething was seriously wrong. There was something, however, in this\r\n\"Agreement for an Adventure\" which pointed straight to it. That was\r\na clause which guaranteed those who became vassals that they should\r\nhave the same freight rates and get back the same rebates as the\r\nmonopoly.[102] \"Had the monopoly the power,\" said the Hon. Stanley\r\nMatthews, \"to procure freights on better and more advantageous terms\r\nthan the rest of the public engaged in the same business?... And\r\nif they had such power, how did it get it?... If this or any other\r\ncorporation is allowed to exalt itself in this way and by these means\r\nabove competition, it is also exalted above the law.\"\r\n\r\nThe great lawyer, who soon afterwards became a justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, could not answer the questions he raised.\r\nThe facts were hidden in secret contracts with the railroads. As\r\nregards Cleveland, they did not come out until five years later, in\r\n1885. It then became an adjudicated fact that in 1875, the year before\r\nthis \"Agreement for an Adventure,\" the Lake Shore Railroad had made\r\na contract with the oil combination to drive these very competitors\r\nand all others out of business, just as the same road had done for\r\nthe South Improvement Company in 1872. When they escaped from their\r\n\"reconciler,\" they brought this railroad and the contract into court.\r\nThe case was fought up to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThat tribunal found that the Lake Shore road had contracted with this\r\ncompany to carry its products ten cents per barrel cheaper than for any\r\nother customers. It showed that this made a difference to the victims\r\nof the \"Adventure\" equal to more than 21 per cent. a year on their\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\"The understanding,\" the court said, \"was to keep the price _down_ for\r\nthe favored customers, but _up_ for all the others, and the inevitable\r\ntendency and effect of this contract was to enable the Standard Oil\r\nCompany to establish and maintain an overshadowing monopoly, to ruin\r\nall other operators, and drive them out of business.\" The course of the\r\nrailroad the court declared to be one of \"active participation in the\r\nunlawful purposes\" of the oil company. The Lake Shore was to have all\r\nits business out of Cleveland, but, a competing railroad being built,\r\nthe Lake Shore made a contract to give this new line a part of the\r\nplum, to induce it to unite in the policy of keeping freights _down_\r\nfor the favored customer, and _up_ for all others. When the President\r\nof the trust was asked afterwards by the New York Legislature if there\r\nhad been no arrangement by which it got its transportation cheaper than\r\nothers could, he replied, \"No, sir.\" And later he reiterated that in\r\ntheir arrangements for freight there was \"nothing peculiar.\"[103]\r\n\r\nBut the Supreme Court of Ohio, in describing this arrangement,\r\ndiversify the staid rhetoric of their legal deliverance with the\r\nunaffected exclamation:\r\n\r\n\"How peculiar!\"\r\n\r\nThey declared the contract between the two railroads \"void,\" and \"not\r\nonly contrary to a sound public policy, but to the lax demands of\r\nthe commercial honesty and ordinary methods of business.\" They also\r\npronounced the contract between the railroad and the oil company as\r\n\"made to build up a monopoly,\" and as \"unlawful.\"[104]\r\n\r\nThe great lawyer, we have said, could not answer the questions he\r\nasked. The facts, we have said, were hidden in a secret contract. And\r\nyet the answers to the questions, the facts, had been all brought to\r\nthe verge of disclosure by the investigation by Congress early in the\r\nsame year, 1876.\r\n\r\nAlthough the investigation, in consequence of the \"I object\" of the\r\nHon. Henry B. Payne, of Cleveland,[105] had been referred to the\r\nCommittee of Commerce, and though the railroad and oil clique men\r\nwould not answer, and the committee would not press them, there was a\r\nvolunteer witness from Cleveland, who began to upset all the plans to\r\nsmother. This willing witness was a Cleveland refiner, a shrewd man,\r\nas would easily be believed by those who knew that he was the brother\r\nof an organizer of the oil combination. He, too, had been a member of\r\nit, but for some reasons was now \"out,\" and was one of the swimmers\r\nwho felt themselves being drawn down. He betook himself for relief to\r\nCongress. He dodged no subpoenas, but, going before the Committee of\r\nCommerce, he began to tell more fully than any other witness had ever\r\ndone, or had ever been able to do, the story of the relations between\r\nthe combination and the railroads, which he knew of his personal\r\nknowledge. When he began talking in this free way to the public\r\nauthorities, his former associates saw that they had underestimated\r\nhis abilities as a refiner. They began to feel that it might be well\r\nto make some concessions to this particular brother, though not to the\r\nBrotherhood of Man.\r\n\r\nThe investigation was summarily suspended,[106] and his testimony\r\nwas spirited away. With the only power that could have interfered\r\nthus silenced, the surviving independents were corralled as we have\r\ndescribed. This was done two short months after the first move was\r\nmade, May 16th, for the investigation which might have saved the\r\nindependents at Cleveland and elsewhere from the duress which drove men\r\nto death or adventures of reconciliation.\r\n\r\nAll over the oil regions the combination has followed this policy of\r\n\"not to exceed half.\"[107]\r\n\r\nNineteen pages of the testimony of a member in the suit begun by the\r\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania are taken up with the operations of one\r\nof its constituent companies in the purchase or leasing of competing\r\nrefineries, many of which were shut down or pulled down.\r\n\r\nThis witness could name only one refinery out of the score of\r\nindependent concerns once flourishing in Pittsburg, which was not under\r\nits control.[108]\r\n\r\n\"Dismantled,\" was the monotonous refrain of many of his answers to the\r\nquestions as to what had been done with the refineries thus got under\r\ncontrol. Asked why these works had been thus dismantled or shut down,\r\nhe explained it variously as due to unfavorable location or worn-out\r\nmachinery or some such disadvantage.\r\n\r\nIf these works were so badly situated and so illy fitted for the\r\nbusiness and so old, why did it purchase them? \"Can you give good\r\ncommercial reasons why it would buy all unprofitable junk?\" he was\r\nasked.[109]\r\n\r\n\"I cannot give any reason why they bought the works,\" was the helpless\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning to the end the language used by the founders of\r\nthe combination proves scarcity to have been their object. \"There is\r\na large number of refineries in the country--a great deal larger than\r\nis required for the manufacture of the oil produced in the country, or\r\nfor the wants of the consumers in Europe and America,\" said one of the\r\nprincipal members in 1872.[110]\r\n\r\nThis is almost identical with the language used in 1880 in the effort\r\nto enjoin Cleveland refiners who \"threatened to distil.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1887 we will see the same power putting its hand and seal to an\r\nagreement to enforce the doctrine that there was too much oil in the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 there were more refineries than were needed for the oil; in\r\n1887 there was too much oil. The progression is significant. And down\r\nto the present pool with the Scotch refiners we will see the same men\r\nenforcing abroad, year by year, the same gospel of want.[111]\r\n\r\n\"The producers in America are quite alive to the wisdom of not\r\nproducing too much paraffine, and are already adopting measures to\r\nrestrict it,\" said the chairman at the annual meeting of one of the\r\nprincipal Scotch companies.[112]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\"YOU ARE NOT TO REFINE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the obituary column of the Cleveland _Herald_, of June 6, 1874, was\r\ngiven the news of the death of one of the pioneer manufacturers of\r\nCleveland. He began the refining of petroleum in that city in 1860,\r\nseveral years before any of those who afterwards became the sovereigns\r\nof the business had left their railroad platforms, book-keeping stools,\r\nand lawyers' desks. He was married in the same year, and from that\r\ntime until his death, in 1874, gave his whole life to his refinery and\r\nhis family, and was successful with both. The _Herald_ said of him\r\neditorially:\r\n\r\n \"He was well known in Cleveland and elsewhere as a business man of\r\n high character. He was a prominent member of the First Presbyterian\r\n Church, was at one time President of the Young Men's Christian\r\n Association, and was active in all enterprises of a religious and\r\n benevolent character. He was about forty years of age, and leaves a\r\n wife and three children.\"\r\n\r\nHis enterprise had been \"very profitable,\" his wife said afterwards\r\nin court, in narrating how she and her children fared after the death\r\nof the husband, father, and bread-winner. \"My husband devoted his\r\nentire energies and life to the business from about 1860 to the time\r\nof his death, and had acquired through his name a large patronage. My\r\nhusband went into debt just before his death,\" she continued, \"for the\r\nfirst time in his life. For the interest of my fatherless children, as\r\nwell as myself, I thought it my duty to continue the business. I took\r\n$75,000 of the $100,000 of stock, and continued from that time, 1874,\r\nuntil November, 1878, making handsome profits, during perhaps the\r\nhardest business years of the time since my husband had begun.\"[113]\r\n\r\nThe business received from her the most thorough and faithful\r\nattention, and she maintained the prosperity her husband had founded by\r\nmaking a profit of about $25,000 a year.\r\n\r\nA representative of one of the oil combination came to her, she\r\ncontinued, \"with a proposition that I should sell to them.\" This\r\nagent was \"a brother manufacturer,\" who, but a short time before in\r\na conference with her, had agreed that in view of the dangers which\r\nseemed to threaten them, he and she should mutually watch out for each\r\nother, and that no arrangement should be made by either without letting\r\nthe other know. The next she saw of her ally he pounced upon her in her\r\noffice with the news that he was in the oil combination, that the head\r\nof it had told him he meant to have control of the refining business\r\nif it took him ten years, but he hoped to have it in two. He went on\r\nto warm the woman's heart by the declaration that since he had become\r\nacquainted with the secrets of the organization he wondered that he and\r\nshe had been able to hold out so long. After which preliminaries he\r\nproposed that she, too, should sell to it. With sagacity and spirit she\r\ndeclined point-blank to have any negotiation with him.\r\n\r\nShe declined to deal with subordinates, and said she did not want to\r\nsell. The principal then called upon her at her residence. This was\r\nin 1878, and these were dark days for \"outside\" refiners. One by one\r\nthey were sinking out of sight, and slipping under the yoke like the\r\nvictims of the \"reconciliation\" and \"equalization\" described in the\r\nlast chapter.\r\n\r\nFor six years word had been passing from one frightened lip to\r\nanother that they were all destined for the maw or the morgue, and\r\nthe fulfilment of the word had been appalling. He knew the members of\r\nthe oil combination, one of the best-known veterans of the oil region\r\ntestified in this case, naming them; \"I have heard some of them say, in\r\nsubstance, 'that they intended to wipe out all the refineries in the\r\ncountry except their own, and to control the entire refining business\r\nof the United States.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The big fish are going to eat the little fish,\" one of the big fish\r\ntold a neighbor and competitor. When one of the little fish said he\r\n\"would not sell and was not afraid,\" he was told, \"You may not be\r\nafraid to have your head cut off, but your body will suffer!\"\r\n\r\nThe woman was brave with love and enthusiasm for the memory of her\r\nhusband and the future of her children. She had had a great success,\r\nbut she knew the sea she was swimming. She saw strong men going down on\r\nevery side. She herself afterwards told in court of her great anxiety\r\nas she would hear of one refinery after another surrendering, feeling\r\nsure that that would eventually be the fate of her company.\r\n\r\nAll that the witnesses just quoted had reported, all that was said\r\nof the same tenor by the witnesses before Congress in 1876, and much\r\nmore, had been filling the hearts of the business men of Cleveland,\r\nPittsburg, Titusville, New York, with a reign of terror ever since\r\n1872. It was with a full realization of all this that she went down\r\nto her parlor to receive the great man of commerce, who passes the\r\ncontribution-box for widows' mites outside the church as well as\r\nwithin. This gentleman was in her house in pursuance, practically, of\r\nhis own motion. She did not want to sell; the suggestion of a sale had\r\ncome from the other side. \"I told him,\" the widow said to the judge,\r\n\"that I realized that my company was entirely in the power\" of his\r\ncompany. \"All I can do,\" I said to him, \"is to appeal to your honor\r\nas a gentleman, and to your sympathy, to do the best with me that you\r\ncan. I beg of you to consider your wife in my position, left with this\r\nbusiness and with fatherless children, and with a large indebtedness\r\nthat my husband had just contracted for the first time in his life. I\r\nfelt that I could not do without the income arising from this business,\r\nand I have taken it up and gone on, and been successful in the hardest\r\nyears since my husband commenced.\" \"I am aware,\" he replied, \"of what\r\nyou have done. My wife could never have accomplished so much.\" She had\r\nbecome alarmed, the woman of business resumed, because his company was\r\n\"getting control of all the refineries in the country.\"\r\n\r\nHe promised, with tears in his eyes, that he would stand by her. It\r\nshould never be said, he cried, that he had wronged the widow of his\r\nfellow-refiner. \"He agreed that I might retain whatever amount of stock\r\nI desired. He seemed to want only the control. I thought his feelings\r\nwere such that I could trust him, and that he would deal honorably\r\nwith me.\" This was the last she saw of him. He promised to come to\r\nsee her during the negotiations, but did not do so. He promised to\r\nassist and advise her, but did not do so. He declined to conduct the\r\nnegotiations with her in person as she requested, \"stating to her,\"\r\nhe said, in giving his version of the affair to the court, \"that I\r\nknew nothing about her business or the mechanical appliances used in\r\nthe same, and that I could not pursue any negotiations with her with\r\nreference to the same; but that if, after reflection, she desired to\r\ndo so, some of our people familiar with the lubricating-oil business\r\nwould take up the question with her.... When she responded, expressing\r\nher fears about the future of the business, stating that she could\r\nnot get cars to transport sufficient oil, and other similar remarks,\r\nI stated to her that though we were using our cars, and required them\r\nin our own business, yet we would loan her any number she required, or\r\ndo anything else in reason to assist her, and I saw no reason why she\r\ncould not prosecute her business just as successfully in the future\r\nas in the past.\" This assurance to his widow-competitor that he would\r\nlet her have cars was, of itself, enough to justify all her alarm, and\r\nshow that there was no hope for her but in making the best surrender\r\npossible. It was proof positive that he did control the transportation,\r\nthat the well-defined report that no one but he and his could get\r\ntheir business done by the railroad was true. Permission to go upon\r\nthe highways by the favor of a competitor is too thin a plank for even\r\na woman to be got to walk. Withdrawing from direct connection, but\r\nmanaging the affair to the end as he testifies, he sent back to her the\r\nagent she had refused to talk with.\r\n\r\nNegotiations were accordingly resumed perforce with this agent. He\r\nsubmitted to his principals a statement in her behalf of the value of\r\nthe property, but did not waste time over the form of letting her see\r\nit, or consulting with her before submitting it in her name.\r\n\r\nThis statement she never authorized, never heard of, and never read\r\nuntil it was produced in court against her.[114]\r\n\r\nOne interesting feature of the contract which was the subject of the\r\n\"adventure\" described in the chapter \"Not to Exceed Half\" was repeated\r\nhere. The representative who \"took up this matter\" with the widow\r\ncarried on his bargaining in great part with the minor stockholders,\r\none of whom claimed afterwards that all he had done was under her\r\ndirections, and \"to her entire satisfaction.\" But she was entirely\r\nunaware of either her \"directions\" or her \"satisfaction.\" \"He never\r\nhad the slightest authority from me to represent me in any way in the\r\nsale.\"[115]\r\n\r\nAnother of the minor stockholders also busied himself in representing\r\nher without her knowledge. On behalf of the widow agents were making\r\nfigures, though she knew nothing of their agency or the figures.\r\nBy these combined efforts a sale was finally concluded at figures\r\nwhich, though she owned seven-tenths of the property, she had never\r\nauthorized, and were far below the only figures she had given as those\r\nshe was willing to take.\r\n\r\nCompelled to deal with a subordinate against her will, fearing to\r\nremain in so hazardous an occupation, and yet needing for her children\r\nthe income it brought her, this woman manufacturer's position was most\r\nharassing. All through, as her cashier and treasurer told the court,\r\nshe was dissatisfied, felt that she was compelled to sell though she\r\nwanted to retain her property.\r\n\r\n\"In my hearing,\" her confidential clerk said, \"she declared she sold\r\nbecause she was compelled to do so.\"\r\n\r\nShe told her fellow-stockholders that she had been informed by the\r\nagent who was dealing with her, that if they did not sell out it would\r\nonly be a question of time before they would be forced to sell out, as\r\nhe intended to place oil like that made by her company in the hands of\r\nall their agents, to undersell them and close them out. This decided\r\nthem to sell.\r\n\r\n\"Inasmuch as the managers of the Standard Oil Company appeared to have\r\nmade up their minds to obtain this property, and not to give them the\r\nchance they had before in competition,\" the stockholders, as one of\r\nthem testified, \"concluded it better to sell the property at such price\r\nas they could then get, rather than to run the risk of a still greater\r\nloss in the future, not one of the stockholders desiring to part with\r\nthe property at all, but rather choosing with fair competition to\r\nretain their interest in the property.\"[116]\r\n\r\nShe had made 15 per cent. in the last six months, and, aside from\r\nthese threats, the business looked prosperous, for the orders were\r\nbecoming more numerous every day. But the widow could refuse to sell\r\nonly by braving threats which had broken more than two out of three\r\nof all the men about her. She put upon the property a price warranted\r\nby its income, $200,000, which was adopted by the directors of the\r\ncompany in a formal motion authorizing a sale at that figure. But in\r\nher name a proposition was made by the agent to sell for $71,000. \"I\r\nnever heard of the figure of $71,000,\" she says, \"and cannot imagine\r\nwhere it originated. The only proposition that was ever made was that\r\nof $200,000.\" What the stock was worth in her estimation and that\r\nof her employés who had inside knowledge is seen in the evidence of\r\nher confidential clerk. Though he was her nephew also, he had with\r\ndifficulty, he says, bought stock at par.\r\n\r\nShe had refused to sell at par to others. Now the only offer she could\r\nget was $60,000 for the works and good-will, the purchasers paying in\r\naddition the cash value of the material in stock, and at that price she\r\nhad to let them go. She asked to be allowed to remain an owner to the\r\nextent of $15,000 in the business into which she and her husband had\r\nbuilt their lives. \"No outsider can have any interest in this concern,\"\r\nwas the reply. The combination \"has dallied as long as it will over\r\nthis matter,\" its agent continued. \"It must be settled up to-day or go.\"\r\n\r\nThe power of this business to produce a profit of $25,000 a year was\r\nworth almost $400,000, according to the valuations maintained for\r\nthe stock of the oil trust on the New York Stock Exchange by the men\r\nwho bought out the widow. One hundred dollars in oil trust stock\r\nproducing $12 a year has sold as high as $185. If $12 a year was\r\nworth $185, $25,000 a year was worth nearly $400,000. It was part of\r\nthe agreement that the oil company should go on as before. \"It was\r\nparticularly enjoined,\" testified the cashier and treasurer, \"that the\r\nsale should be kept a profound secret.\"[117] It was intended that the\r\ncompany should go on as before as far as the public was concerned. The\r\npurchasers agreed to continue to employ the hands already at work, but\r\nstipulated that not a word should be said to any one of them to reveal\r\nthat the company was not as independent as it had been.[118]\r\n\r\n\"And you are not to engage in the refining business,\" is the concluding\r\nphrase of an agreement between the oil combination and a once\r\ncompetitor whom it had forced to sell out in 1876.[119]\r\n\r\n\"You are not to engage in refining,\" the same power said in 1877 to the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, and now to this widow: You must sign this bond\r\nnot to go into business again for ten years.\r\n\r\nThe bond is given in full in the record of the case. It put the widow\r\nunder a forfeit of five thousand dollars for ten years, that--\r\n\r\n \"I will not directly, or indirectly, in any way, either alone or in\r\n company with any person, or as a share-holder in any corporation,\r\n engage in or in any way concern myself or allow knowingly any capital\r\n or moneys to be employed in the business or trade of refining,\r\n manufacturing, producing, piping, or dealing in petroleum, or any of\r\n its products, within the county of Cuyahoga, and State of Ohio, nor at\r\n any other place whatsoever.\"[120]\r\n\r\nTheir secret of success, the president swore in this very case, is \"the\r\nvery large volume\" of purchases, \"long continuance in the business,\"\r\n\"experience,\" \"knowledge of all the avenues of trade,\" \"skill of\r\nexperienced employés,\" and so forth. But with all this they did not\r\ndare leave this middle-aged woman free to challenge them again on\r\nthe field of competition. The purchase was made in the name of three\r\nmembers of the great oil company, and it was paid for by the check of\r\nthat concern.\r\n\r\nOf these men one was among the \"trustees\" indicted and tried in 1885\r\nfor complicity in the plot to blow up a rival refinery, but let go by\r\nthe judge.\r\n\r\nAt the time the sale was concluded the widow refiner declared, \"The\r\nobtaining of her stock was no better than stealing.\" When the papers\r\nwere brought to her to sign she \"hesitated,\" and said, \"It is like\r\nsigning my death-warrant. I believe it will prove my death-warrant.\"\r\n\"The promises made by the president,\" she testifies, \"were none of them\r\nfulfilled.\"\r\n\r\nBeing only a woman, and not understanding \"business,\" for all her\r\nbrilliant success in stepping into her husband's place, and doing\r\nthe double work of home-maker and bread-winner, the widow could not\r\nrestrain herself from giving a most uncommercial piece of her mind\r\nto those who had got possession of her property for a sum which they\r\nwould recover out of its profits in two or three years. She sent the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n \"November 11, 1878, Monday Morning.\r\n\r\n \"SIR,--When you left me at the time of our interview the other\r\n morning, after promising me so much, you said you had simply dropped\r\n the remarks you had for my thought. I can assure you I have thought\r\n much and long as I have waited and watched daily to see you fulfil\r\n those promises, and it is impossible for me to tell you how utterly\r\n astonished I am at the course you have pursued with me. Were it not\r\n for the knowledge I have that there is a God in heaven, and that you\r\n will be compelled to give an account for all the deeds done here, and\r\n there, in the presence of my husband, will have to confess whether you\r\n have wronged me and his fatherless children or not--were it not for\r\n this knowledge I could not endure it for a moment, the fact that a\r\n man, possessed of the millions that you are, will permit to be taken\r\n from a widow a business that had been the hard life work and pride\r\n of herself and husband, one that was paying the handsome profit of\r\n nearly twenty-five thousand dollars per annum, and give me in return\r\n what a paltry sum, that will net me less than three thousand dollars;\r\n and it is done in a manner that says, Take this or we will crush you\r\n out. And when, on account of the sacred associations connected with\r\n the business, and also the family name it bears, I plead that I may be\r\n permitted to retain a slight interest (you having promised the same\r\n at our interview), you then, in your cold, heartless manner, send\r\n me word that no outsider can hold a dollar's worth of stock in that\r\n concern. It seems strange to be called an outsider in a business that\r\n has been almost entirely our own and built up at the _cost_ it has to\r\n ourselves. It is impossible for us to find language to express our\r\n perfect indignation at such proceedings. We do not envy you in the\r\n least when this is made known in all its detail to the public. One of\r\n your own number admits that it is a great _moral_ wrong, but says as\r\n long as you can cover the points legally you think you are all right.\r\n I doubt, myself, very much the legality of all these things. But do\r\n not forget, my dear sir, that God will judge us morally, not legally,\r\n and should you offer him your entire monopoly, it will not make it\r\n any easier for you. I should not feel that I had done my entire duty\r\n unless, before I close, I drop a remark for your thoughts. In my poor\r\n way I have tried, by my life and example, with all those I have come\r\n in contact with in a business way, to persuade them to a higher,\r\n purer, and better life. I think there is no place in the world that\r\n one has such opportunities to work for good or evil as in a business\r\n life. I cannot tell you the sorrow it has caused me to have one of\r\n those in whom I have had the greatest hopes tell me, within the last\r\n few days, that it was enough to drive _honest_ men away from the\r\n Church of God, when professing Christians do as you have done by me.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to this she received a letter in which her charge that her\r\nbusiness had been taken from her was repelled as \"a most grievous\r\nwrong,\" and \"a great injustice.\" She was reminded that two years\r\nbefore she had consulted with the writer and another member of the\r\noil combination \"as to selling out your interest, at which time you\r\nwere desirous of selling at _considerably less price_, and upon time,\r\nthan you have now received in cash, and which sale you would have been\r\nglad to have closed if you could have obtained satisfactory security\r\nfor the deferred payments. As to the price paid for the property, it\r\nis certainly three times greater than the cost at which we could now\r\nconstruct equal or better facilities.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter concluded with an offer to return the works upon the return\r\nof the money, or, if she preferred, to sell her one hundred, or two\r\nhundred, or three hundred shares of the stock at the price that had\r\nbeen paid her. These propositions were left open to her for three days.\r\n\r\nThe \"cost of the works\" is not the standard of value in such\r\ntransactions. Six millions of dollars, according to a member of the\r\ncommittee of Congress which investigated the oil trust in 1888, is the\r\nvalue of the \"works\" on which they issued $90,000,000 of stock, which\r\nsold in the stock market at a valuation of $160,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe offer to sell back the refinery was like the offer to let her have\r\ncars. To accept it was to pass openly and consciously into slavery.\r\nTwo years before, when she was weak with grief, inexperience, and the\r\nfear that she might not succeed in her gallant task of paying her\r\nhusband's debts and saving the livelihood of the children, she had\r\nthought of selling out at a sacrifice. They knew this because she had\r\nasked their advice, and now cheapened her down by reference to the\r\nvaluation of that moment of despair. All the life energies of herself\r\nand her husband, the various advantages of position, the benefit of\r\ntheir pioneership since 1860, and of having established a place in so\r\nlucrative a business, all the good-will of customers, all the elements\r\nthat contributed to the ability to earn the nearly $25,000 a year she\r\nwas making, were brushed out of the bargain by the mere assertion of\r\na figure at which it was alleged better works could be built. By the\r\ntime the offer was made she had, moreover, put the sum she had received\r\ninto such investments, she told the court, as she had been able to\r\nfind, and the money to accept the offer was no longer in her hands.\r\nIndignant with these thoughts, and the massacred troop of hopes and\r\nambitions that her brave heart had given birth to, she threw the letter\r\ninto the fire, where it curled up into flames like those from which\r\na Dives once begged for a drop of water. She never reappeared in the\r\nworld of business, where she had found no chivalry to help a woman save\r\nher home, her husband's life-work, and her children. But when the men\r\nwho had divided her property among them invoked the assistance of the\r\nlaw to complete the \"equalization\" told of in the previous chapter,\r\nshe went into court and told her story to save her friends from ruin.\r\nThere, under the gathering dust of years, this incident has remained\r\nburied in the document-room of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga\r\nCounty, until now brought forth to give the people a glimpse into what\r\nthe real things are which our professors of market philosophy cover\r\nwith their glittering generalities about the cost of production and the\r\nsurvival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nThis episode and that of the \"Agreement for an Adventure\" in the\r\npreceding chapter have been written up by the author from the original\r\npapers on file in the Court of Common Pleas at Cleveland, which he\r\nvisited for that purpose in 1891. Certified copies of the documents\r\nwere procured from the clerk of the court. Lately, the astounding fact\r\nwas ascertained that all the documents except two or three formal\r\npleadings were gone from the records of the court. But for these\r\ncertified copies there would now be no authentic record of these cases.\r\nThis disappearance bears a strong likeness to the suppression of the\r\ninvestigation by the Committee of Commerce of Congress in 1872, and the\r\ntheft of the testimony taken by the House Committee of Commerce[121]\r\nin 1876, and the mutilation of the transcript submitted to Congress in\r\n1888 of the evidence taken in the Buffalo Explosion Case.[122]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\"NO!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has never been any real break in the plans revealed, \"partly\r\nborn,\" \"and buried\" in 1872. From then till now, in 1893, every fact\r\nthat has come to the surface has shown them in full career. If they\r\nwere buried, it was as seed is--for a larger crop of the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe people had made peace, in 1872, on the pledge of \"perfect equality\"\r\non the highways. Hardly had they got back to their work when they\r\nbegan to feel the pinch of privilege again. The Pennsylvania road\r\nalone is credited with any attempt to keep faith, and that only \"for\r\nsome months.\" \"Gradually,\" as a committee of the people wrote to the\r\nmanagers of the Pennsylvania Railroad, \"the persons constituting the\r\nSouth Improvement Company were placed by the roads in as favorable\r\na position as to rates and facilities as had been stipulated in the\r\noriginal contract with that company.\"[123]\r\n\r\nAs soon as pipe lines were proved practicable they were built as\r\nrapidly as pipes and men to put them in the ground could be had, but\r\nthere was some lubricant by which they kept constantly slipping into\r\nbankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThey were \"frozen out,\" as one of their builders said, \"summer as well\r\nas winter.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1874, twenty pipe lines had been laid in the oil country. Eighty per\r\ncent. of them died off in that and the following year.[124] The mere\r\npipes did not die, they are there yet; but the ownership of the many\r\nwho had built them died.\r\n\r\nThere were conservatives in the field to whom competition was as\r\ndistasteful as to the socialists. To \"overcome such competition,\" and\r\nto insure them \"a full and regular\" and \"remunerative business\" in\r\npipe lines, in the language of the South Improvement Company contract,\r\nall that was needed was to put into operation the machinery of that\r\ncontract which no longer existed--in name. The decease of the name was\r\nnot an insuperable obstacle.\r\n\r\nIn exact reproduction of the plan of 1872, the railroads, in October,\r\n1874, advanced rates to the general ruin, but to the pool of lines\r\nowned by their old friends of the South Improvement Company they paid\r\nback a large rebate. That those who had such a railroad Lord Bountiful\r\nto fill their pockets should grow rich fast was a matter of course.[125]\r\n\r\nGetting this refund they got all the business. Oil, like other things,\r\nfollows the line of least resistance, and will not flow through pipes\r\nwhere it has to pay when it can run free and get something to boot.\r\nNobody could afford to buy oil except those who were in this deal. They\r\ncould go into the market, and out of these bonuses could bid higher\r\nthan any one else. They \"could overbid in the producing regions, and\r\nundersell in the markets of the world.\"[126]\r\n\r\nThis was not all. In the circular which announced the bounty to the\r\npet pipes there was another surprise. It showed that the roads had\r\nagreed to carry crude oil to their friends' refineries at Pittsburg and\r\nCleveland without charge from the wells, and to charge them no more for\r\ncarrying back refined oil to the seaboard for export than was charged\r\nto refineries next door to the wells and hundreds of miles nearer the\r\nmarket. \"Outside\" refiners who had put themselves near the wells and\r\nthe seaboard were to be denied the benefit of their business sagacity.\r\nThe Cleveland refiners, whose location was superior only for the\r\nWestern trade, were to be forced into a position of unnatural equality\r\nin the foreign trade. In short, the railroads undertook to pay, instead\r\nof being paid, for what they carried for these friends, and force them\r\ninto an equality with manufacturers who had builded better than they.\r\n\r\nEvidently they who had contrived all this had their despondent moments,\r\nwhen they feared that its full beneficence would not be understood by a\r\npublic unfamiliar with the \"science of transportation.\"\r\n\r\nTo the new rules was attached an explanation which asserted the right\r\nof the railroads to prevent persons and localities from enjoying the\r\nadvantage of any facility they may possess, no matter how \"real.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will observe that under this system the rate is even and fair to\r\nall parties, preventing one locality taking advantage of its neighbor\r\nby reason of some alleged or real facility it may possess.\"[127]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile good society was shuddering at its reformers, and declaring\r\nthat they meant to stop competition and \"divide up property.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you do that in any business except oil?\" the most distinguished\r\nrailroad man of that day was asked. \"Do you carry a raw product to\r\na place 150 miles distant and back again to another point like that\r\nwithout charge, so as to put them on an equality?\"\r\n\r\nTo which he replied--it was he who could not remember that he had ever\r\nseen the South Improvement Company contract he signed in 1872--\"I don't\r\nknow.\"[128]\r\n\r\n\"Could any more flagrant violation of every principle of railroad\r\neconomy and natural justice be imagined than this?\" the report of the\r\nNew York Legislature asks.[129]\r\n\r\nAn expert introduced by the railroads defended this arrangement. He\r\ninsisted that all pipe lines had a chance to enter the pool and get the\r\nsame refund.[130] But a witness from the pipe-line country, who was\r\nbrought to New York to testify to the relations of the railroads and\r\nthe oil combination, let out the truth.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't they go into the pool?\" he was asked, in reference to one\r\nof the most important pipe lines.\r\n\r\n\"Because they were not allowed to. They wanted to freeze them out. They\r\nwere shut out from the market practically.\"[131]\r\n\r\nFor these enterprises, as they failed one after the other, there was\r\nbut one buyer--the group of gentlemen who called themselves the South\r\nImprovement Company in 1872, but now in the field of pipe-line activity\r\nhad taken the name of United Pipe Line, since known as the National\r\nTransit Company, and then and now a part of the oil trust.\r\n\r\n\"The United Pipe Line bought up the pipes as they became bankrupt one\r\nafter another,\" testified the same friendly witness.[132]\r\n\r\nThen came a great railroad war in 1877. A fierce onslaught was made on\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad by all the other trunk lines.\r\n\r\nIn this affair, as in all dynastic wars, the public knew really nothing\r\nabout what was being done or why. The newspapers were filled with the\r\nsmoke of the battles of the railroad kings; but the newspapers did not\r\ntell, for they did not then know, that the railroads were but tools of\r\nconquest in the hands of greater men.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the trouble was that the managers of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad had begun to reach out for the control of the oil trade.\r\nThey had joined in the agreement in 1872 to give it to the oil\r\ncombination, but now they wanted it for themselves. Through a mistletoe\r\ncorporation--the Empire Transportation Company--they set to work\r\nbuilding up a great business in oil cars, pipe lines, refineries.\r\n\r\n\"We like competition; we like our competitors; we are neighbors and\r\nfriends, and have been all these years,\" the president of the oil\r\ntrust testified to the New York Legislature,[133] but he served notice\r\nupon this competitor to abandon the field.[134] He and his associates\r\ndetermined to do more than compel the great railroad to cease its\r\ncompetition. They determined to possess themselves of its entire oil\r\noutfit, though it was the greatest corporation then in America. This,\r\nthe boldest stroke yet attempted, could be done only with the help of\r\nthe other trunk lines, and that was got.\r\n\r\nThe ruling officials of the New York Central, the Erie, the Baltimore\r\nand Ohio, the Lehigh Valley, the Reading, the Atlantic and Great\r\nWestern, the Lake Shore railroads, and their connections, were made to\r\nbelieve, or pretended to believe, that it was their duty to make an\r\nattack upon the Pennsylvania Railroad to force it to surrender.[135]\r\n\"A demand,\" says the New York Legislative Committee of 1879, \"which\r\nthey\"--the railroads--\"joined hands with the Standard Oil Company and\r\nproceeded to enforce by a war of rates, which terminated successfully\r\nin October of that year\" (1877).[136]\r\n\r\nThe war was very bitter. Oil was carried at eight cents a barrel less\r\nthan nothing by the Pennsylvania.[137] How low the rates were made by\r\nthe railroads on the other side is not known. The Pennsylvania was the\r\nfirst to sue for peace. Twice its vice-president \"went to Canossa,\"\r\nwhich was Cleveland. It got peace and absolution only by selling its\r\nrefineries and pipe lines and mortgaging its oil cars to the oil\r\ncombination. It \"was left without the control of a foot of pipe line to\r\ngather, a tank to receive, or a still to refine a barrel of petroleum,\r\nand without the ability to secure the transportation of one, except\r\nat the will of men who live and whose interests lie in Ohio and New\r\nYork.\"[138]\r\n\r\nIt was only seven years since the buyers had organized with a\r\ncapital of $1,000,000. Now they were able to give their check for\r\nover $3,000,000 for this one purchase. \"I was surprised,\" said Mr.\r\nVanderbilt to the New York Legislative Committee of 1878, speaking\r\nof this transaction, \"at the amount of ready cash they were able to\r\nprovide.\" They secured, in addition to the valuable pipe lines, oil\r\ncars, and refineries in New York and Pennsylvania, the more valuable\r\npledge given by the Pennsylvania Railroad that it would never again\r\nenter the field of competition in refining, and also a contract\r\ngiving the oil combination one-tenth of all the oil freights received\r\nby the Pennsylvania Railroad, whether from the combination or its\r\ncompetitors--an arrangement it succeeded in making as well with the New\r\nYork Central, Lake Shore, and other railroads.[139]\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest members of the oil combination was present at the\r\nmeeting to consummate this purchase. Something over $3,000,000 of his\r\nand his associates' cash changed hands. The meeting was important\r\nenough to command the presence of a brigade of lawyers for the great\r\ncorporations, and of the president, vice-president, and several\r\ndirectors of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and, representing the Poor\r\nMan's Light, the vice-president, the secretary, and five of the leading\r\nmembers of the combination, besides himself.[140]\r\n\r\nBut when asked in court about it he could not remember any such\r\nmeeting. Finally, he recalled \"being at a meeting,\" but he could not\r\nremember when it was, or who was there, or what it was for, or whether\r\nany money was paid.[141]\r\n\r\nThree years later this transaction having been quoted against the\r\ncombination in a way likely to affect the decision of a case in\r\ncourt,[142] the treasurer denied it likewise. \"It is not true as stated\r\n... directly or indirectly....\"[143]\r\n\r\nEight years later, when the exigencies of this suit of 1880, in\r\nCleveland, had passed away, and a new exigency demanded a \"revised\r\nversion,\" the secretary of the combination told Congress that it was\r\ntrue.[144]\r\n\r\n\"The pleasures of memory\" are evidently for poets, not for such\r\nmillionaires. That appears to be the only indulgence they cannot\r\nafford.\r\n\r\nThe managers of the Pennsylvania road went back with the zeal of\r\nbacksliders reconverted to their yoke in the service of the men who had\r\ngiven them this terrific whipping. They sent word to the independent\r\nrefiners, whom they had secured as shippers by the pledge of 1872 of\r\nequal treatment, that equal rates and facilities could be given no\r\nlonger. The producers and refiners did not sit down dumb under the\r\ndeath sentence. They begged for audience of their masters, masters of\r\nthem because masters of the highway.\r\n\r\nThe third vice-president, the official in charge of the freight\r\nbusiness, was sent to meet them.\r\n\r\n\"As you know,\" they began by reminding him, \"we have been for the past\r\nyear the largest shippers of petroleum the Pennsylvania Railroad has\r\nhad.\"\r\n\r\nHe acknowledged it.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we, after the 1st of May, have as low a rate of freight as\r\nanybody else?\" they then asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said; \"after the 1st of May we shall give the Standard Oil\r\nCompany lower rates than to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much discrimination will we have to submit to?\" the poor\r\n\"outsiders\" asked.\r\n\r\n\"I decline to tell you,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"How much business must we bring your road to get as good rates as the\r\ncombination?\" they then asked, and again--\r\n\r\n\"I decline to tell you,\" was the only answer they got.\r\n\r\n\"If we will ship as much, will you give us as low freight rates?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have been shipping over the Pennsylvania Railroad a year,\" they\r\npersisted, \"why can we not continue?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would make them mad; they are the only people who can make peace\r\nbetween the railroads.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said he, \"you ought to fix it up with them. I am going over\r\nthere this afternoon to talk with those people about this matter, and,\"\r\nhe continued, \"you will all be happy, and everything will work along\r\nvery smoothly.\"\r\n\r\n\"We gave him very distinctly to understand that we did not propose to\r\nenter into any 'fix up' where we would lose our identity, or sell out,\r\nor be under anybody else's thumb; we are willing to pay as high a rate\r\nof freight as anybody, and we want it as low as anybody has it,\" they\r\ntold him.\r\n\r\nBut the reply to all of it was, \"You cannot have the same rate of\r\nfreight.\"\r\n\r\nAs the magnate of the railroad seemed to be determined not to permit\r\nthem to move to market along his rails, one of the independents\r\nreferred to a plan for a new pipe line then under consideration by\r\nthem, the Equitable, as perhaps promising them the relief he refused.\r\n\r\n\"Lay all the pipe lines you like,\" the vice-president retorted, with\r\nfeeling, \"and we will buy them up for old iron.\"\r\n\r\nThe independents appealed from the third vice-president to the\r\npresident; they had to beg repeatedly for a hearing before they got\r\nit. They came together in the June following, the independents coming\r\non from New York for the purpose. Since their interview with the third\r\nvice-president rates had been advanced upon them, and not only that,\r\nbut when they had oil ready to ship at those high freight rates, the\r\nrailroad on one pretext or another refused them cars. One of them had\r\ncontracts to deliver oil from his refinery in New York to go abroad.\r\nWhen he ordered the cars that were needed to take the crude oil to New\r\nYork to be refined they were refused him. The ships lay idle at the\r\ndocks, charging him heavy damages for every day of delay; at the wells\r\nhis oil was running on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"You had better go and arrange with the Standard Oil Company; I don't\r\nwant to get into any trouble with them,\" the president said. \"If you\r\nare business men, you will make an arrangement with them. I will do all\r\nin my power to bring it about.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will never take our freight rates from them,\" they replied; \"we are\r\nnot willing to enter into any such arrangement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go to the other roads?\" the president asked his\r\nsuppliants.\r\n\r\n\"We have done so. It's of no use. On the New York Central the cars are\r\nowned by the combination, and the Erie is in a like position. We have\r\nbeen shippers on the Pennsylvania Railroad a long, long while, and\r\nyou ought to take care of us and give us all the cars we need. We are\r\nsuffering very greatly for the want of them. Can we have the same rate\r\nthat other shippers get?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we ship the same amount of oil?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have not cars enough, will you, if we build cars, haul them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. You will not have any peace or prosperity,\" continued the\r\npresident, \"until you make terms with the combination.\"\r\n\r\nLike the third vice-president he offered to intercede with them to get\r\ntransportation over his own road for his own customers. Like men they\r\nrefused the offer.\r\n\r\n\"We were, of course, very indignant,\" one of them said, in relating\r\nthis experience in court.[145]\r\n\r\nA little later a rich and expert refiner, who had sold out in 1876,\r\nmade up his mind to try again. The Pennsylvania road had a new\r\npresident by this time, but the old \"no\" was still in force.\r\n\r\n\"When I was compelled to succumb I thought it was only temporarily,\r\nthat the time would come when I could go into the business I was\r\ndevoted to. I was in love with the business. I took a run across the\r\nwater; I was tired and discouraged and used up in 1878, and was gone\r\nthree or four months. I came back ready for work, and had the plan,\r\nspecifications and estimates made for a refinery that would handle\r\nten thousand barrels of oil in a day. I selected a site near three\r\nrailroads and a river; I would have spent about five hundred thousand\r\ndollars, and probably a couple of hundred thousand more. I believed the\r\ntime had arrived when the Pennsylvania Railroad would see their true\r\ninterest as common carriers, and the interest of their stockholders,\r\nand the business interest of the City of Philadelphia. I called on the\r\nPresident of the Pennsylvania Railroad; I laid the plans before him,\r\nand told him I wanted to build a refinery of ten thousand barrels'\r\ncapacity a day. I was almost on my knees begging him to allow me to do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"'What is it you want?' he said.\r\n\r\n\"'Simply to be put upon an equality with everybody else--especially the\r\nStandard Oil Company. I want you to agree with me that you will give me\r\ntransportation of crude oil as low as you give it to anybody else for\r\nten years, and then I will give you a written assurance that I will do\r\nthis refining of ten thousand barrels of oil a day for ten years. Is\r\nnot that an honest position for us to be in? I as a manufacturer, you\r\nthe president of a railroad.'\r\n\r\n\"'I cannot go into any such agreement.'\r\n\r\n\"I saw the third vice-president. He said, in his frank way, 'That is\r\nnot practicable, and you know the reason why.'\"[146]\r\n\r\nAfter their interviews with the President and Vice-President of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, these outsiders went to the officials of the\r\nother roads, only to hear the same \"No!\" from all.[147]\r\n\r\nAt one time, to get oil to carry out their contracts and fill the\r\nvessels which were waiting at the docks and charging them damages for\r\nthe delay, these refiners telegraphed to the oil regions offering the\r\nproducers there ten cents above the market price if they could get oil\r\nto them over any of the roads to New York. They answered they could not\r\nget the cars, and none of them accepted the offer.[148]\r\n\r\nAll the roads--as in 1872--were in league to \"overcome\" them.\r\n\r\nThus, at a time when the entire movement of oil was at the rate of\r\nonly 25,000 or 30,000 barrels a day, and the roads had cars enough to\r\nmove 60,000 barrels a day, these independent refiners found themselves\r\nshut completely off from the highway.[149] The Pennsylvania Railroad,\r\nthe New York Central, the Erie, and their branches and connections in\r\nand out of the oil regions, east and west, were as entirely closed to\r\nthem as if a foreign enemy had seized the country and laid an embargo\r\non their business--which was, indeed, just what had happened. The only\r\ndifference between that kind of invasion and what had really come\r\nwas, that \"the dear people,\" as the president of the trust called\r\nthem,[150] would have known they were in the hands of an enemy if he\r\nhad come beating his drums loud enough, and firing off his two-thousand\r\npounders often enough, and pricking them deep enough with his bayonets;\r\nbut their wits are not yet up to knowing him when he comes among them\r\ndisguised as an American citizen, although they see property destroyed\r\nand life lost and liberty thrown wherever he moves.\r\n\r\nThere was enough virtue in Pennsylvania to begin a suit in the name\r\nof the State against the men who were using its franchises for such\r\npurposes, though there was not enough to push it to a decision. The\r\nThird Vice-President of the Pennsylvania Railroad, when examined as a\r\nwitness in this suit, confirmed these statements about the interviews\r\nwith himself and the president of the road in every particular about\r\nwhich he was questioned.\r\n\r\n\"We stated to the outside refiners that we would make lower rates to\r\nthe Standard Oil Company than they got; we declined to allow them to\r\nput cars of their own on the road.\"[151]\r\n\r\nHis evidence fills seventy-six pages, closely printed, in the report of\r\ntestimony. It was clear, full, and candid; remarkably so, considering\r\nthat it supplied officially from the company's own records the facts,\r\nitem by item, which proved that the management of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad had violated the Constitution of Pennsylvania and the common\r\nlaw, and had taken many millions of dollars from the people and\r\nfrom the corporation which employed them, and secretly, and for no\r\nconsideration, had given them to strangers.\r\n\r\nThis testimony is so important that it was reprinted substantially\r\nin full both by the \"Hepburn\" committee of the New York Legislature\r\nin 1879[152] and the Trust Investigating Committee of Congress in\r\n1888.[153] As instances, it showed that in one case where the rate to\r\nthe public was $1.15, this favored shipper was charged only 38 cents.\r\nIn another case the trade generally had to pay $1.40 a barrel on crude\r\npetroleum, but the oil combination paid 88-1/2 cents.\r\n\r\n\"And then the refined rate was 80 cents?\"\r\n\r\n\"80 cents net to the Standard.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to all others?\"\r\n\r\n\"$1.44-1/2.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there were no other outside shippers,\" he pleaded--how could there\r\nbe?\r\n\r\nThere was only one important member in Pennsylvania of the oil\r\ncombination who could be caught with a subpoena. At his first\r\nappearance in court, on the witness stand, he took lofty ground.\r\n\r\n\"I decline to answer.\"[154]\r\n\r\nPut on the stand again, he was asked:\r\n\r\n\"Were you allowed a rebate amounting to 64-1/2 cents per barrel?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; not to my knowledge.\"[155]\r\n\r\nPut on the third time and compelled to produce his books, he had to\r\nread aloud in court the entries showing the payment he had thus denied\r\nunder oath.\r\n\r\n\"There was a total allowance of 64-1/2 cents per barrel.\"[156]\r\n\r\nAnd then he shut up again--but too late; and to all other questions\r\nabout his rebates said, gloomily, \"I decline to answer.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the president of the oil trust was asked afterwards by the New\r\nYork Legislature if some company or companies embraced within it had\r\nnot enjoyed from railroads more favorable freight rates than outside\r\nrefineries, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I do not recall anything of that kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have heard of such things?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard much in the papers about it.\"[157]\r\n\r\nBut at the time these rates were being made, one of his principal\r\nassociates admitted that the president was the person who attended to\r\nthe freight rates.[158] This was also put beyond a doubt in the Ohio\r\ninvestigation by the evidence of his first partner in the little oil\r\nrefinery at Cleveland which had grown so great, he who had furnished\r\nthe only mechanical and refining knowledge it had started with, and who\r\nhad, until within a year, been a fellow-stockholder and director.\r\n\r\n\"Do these contracts contain anything of the nature that would\r\ndiscriminate against the small refiners of the State?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they did.... Up to the time I left the company the open rate\r\nwas $1.40 to the seaboard. They\"--the oil combination--\"ship for 80\r\ncents.... The president told me it was the rate at that time.\"[159]\r\n\r\nWith every known avenue to the sea thus closed to them it certainly\r\nlooked as if all was up with the \"outsiders.\" But the men, who had\r\ntoo much American spunk to buy peace with dishonor by consenting to\r\na \"fix-up\" under compulsion, had the wit to find out a loop-hole\r\nof temporary escape. They built tank boats for the canal, and thus\r\nsucceeded in getting 200,000 barrels of oil to New York that summer\r\nbefore the canal closed.[160]\r\n\r\nSince then all chance of escape by the canal has been cut off. The\r\nrailroads made a war of freight rates against it, and the only canal\r\nthat connected the oil regions with the Erie canal route to the sea was\r\ndried up, and turned into a way for a railroad by a special act of the\r\nNew York Legislature. The railroad so built has ever since been managed\r\nas one of the most diligent promoters of the policy of excluding the\r\ncommon people from the oil business.\r\n\r\nAccording to the funeral notices given out by the railroad officials\r\nand the members of the South Improvement Company this concern was dead,\r\nbut in the quaint phrase of the producers it was really alive and hard\r\nat work, but \"with a new suit of clothes and no name.\" These interviews\r\nbetween the independent refiners and the railroad officials of the\r\nthree trunk lines form one of the most extraordinary scenes which have\r\ntaken place between a government and its subjects since the era of\r\nmodern democratic liberty.\r\n\r\nThe railway officials are, in the world of the highway, the government.\r\nThey hold their supreme power to tax commerce, and to open and close\r\nthe highways, solely and altogether by grant of the State, and under\r\nthe law of the common carrier. It is only by the exercise of the\r\nsovereign power of eminent domain to take the property of a private\r\nindividual by force, without his consent, for public use--never for\r\nany other than public use--and only by the grant of the right to cross\r\ncity streets and country roads that the railroads come into existence\r\nat all. This says nothing of the actual cash given to the railroad\r\nprojectors by the government, which, in New York State alone, amounts\r\nto upwards of $40,000,000.[161]\r\n\r\nThe independent refiners represent the people, claiming of the highway\r\ndepartment of their government those equal rights which all citizens\r\nhave as a birthright, and the government informs these citizens that\r\ntheir rights on the highways have been given as a private estate to\r\ncertain friends of the ruling administration, much as William the\r\nConqueror would give this rich abbey or that fertile manor to one of\r\nhis pets.\r\n\r\n\"We have no franchise that is not open to all,\" say the \"trustees.\" \"It\r\nis a free open market.\" \"There is nothing peculiar to our companies.\"\r\n\"It is as free as air.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth they have had no less a franchise than, as in 1872, the\r\nexcluding possession of all the great trunk-lines out of the oil\r\ncountry, and all their connections east and west, and this franchise\r\nhas since widened until, in 1893, it reaches from ocean to ocean, and\r\nfrom gulf to gulf.\r\n\r\nTheir franchise was meant to be as exclusive as if they had had from\r\nthe government letters-patent in the old royal fashion of close\r\nmonopolies in East Indian trade, or salt, or tobacco at home, giving\r\nthem by name the sole right to use the roads, and forbidding all\r\nothers, under pain of business death, from setting their foot on the\r\nhighway. But with this difference: the exclusive franchise in the\r\nlatter case would exist by law; but in this case it was created in\r\ndefiance of law, exists in contempt of the law, and in its living the\r\nlaw dies daily.\r\n\r\nThe refiners and producers who were pleading in this way with the\r\nrailroads for a chance to live after May 1, never doubted but that,\r\nas they were told, and as their arrangements with the Pennsylvania\r\nroad guaranteed, they were having and were to have at worst until that\r\ndate, equal and impartial rates and facilities. Under this safe-conduct\r\nthey parleyed for the future. But the Pennsylvania Railroad was at\r\nthat moment negotiating with the oil combination to collect from the\r\nindependents, under the guise of freight, 20 to 22-1/2 cents a barrel\r\non all they sent to market, and pay it over to the combination. The\r\npayments were made to one of the rings within the oil ring, called the\r\nAmerican Transfer Company. \"It is the same instrumentality under a\r\ndifferent name,\" said the counsel of the New York Chamber of Commerce\r\nbefore the New York Legislature. The official of the Pennsylvania road\r\nwho issued the order to take this money out of the treasury pleaded\r\nin excuse that proof had been given him that other roads were doing\r\nthe same thing.[162] Receipted bills were brought to him, showing that\r\nthe New York Central and the Erie had been \"for many months\" paying\r\nthese men who called themselves American Transfer Company for having\r\n\"protected\" their oil business, sums ranging from 20 cents to 35 cents\r\na barrel on all the oil those roads transported.[163] So deeply was\r\nthe watch-dog of the Pennsylvania road's treasury affected by the\r\nproof that his company was doing less than the other roads, that he\r\ninstructed the comptroller to give these men three months' back pay,\r\nwhich was done. Twenty cents a barrel was sent them out of all the oil\r\nfreights collected by the Pennsylvania for the three months preceding,\r\nand thereafter the tribute was paid them monthly. Then it was increased\r\nto 22-1/2 cents a barrel. The same amount per barrel was refunded to\r\nthem out of their own freight. They received this on all oil shipped\r\nby them, and also on all shipped by their competitors.[164] They who\r\nreceived this tribute pretended to the railroad officials that they\r\n\"protected\" the roads from losing business. The railroad men pretended\r\nto believe it.\r\n\r\nThe way in which this revenue was given and got shows what a simple\r\nand easy thing modern business really is--not in any way the\r\nbrain-racker political economists have persuaded themselves and us.\r\nThe representative of the oil combination writes a bright, cheery\r\nletter; the representative of the Pennsylvania answers it, and there\r\nyou are; 22-1/2 cents a barrel on millions of barrels flows out of\r\nthe cash-box of the railroad into the cash-box of the combination.\r\nIn one year, 1878, this tribute, at the rate of 22-1/2 cents on the\r\n13,750,000 barrels of oil shipped by the three trunk-lines, must have\r\namounted to $3,093,750. The American Transfer Company had a little\r\ncapital of $100,000, and its receipts from this rebate in this one year\r\nwould amount to dividends of 3093 per cent. annually; the capital of\r\nthe oil combination which owned this Transfer Company was at this time\r\n$3,500,000.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons to believe that some of the very railroad men who\r\nturned the money of the railroads over to the American Transfer Company\r\nwere among its members. But if all the profit went to the combination,\r\nand none of it was for the railway officials through whom they got\r\nit, their revenue from that source alone would have paid in 1878 a\r\ndividend nearly equal to this capital of $3,500,000. In this device of\r\nthe American Transfer Company we again see reappear in 1878, in high\r\nworking vitality, the supposed corpse of the South Improvement Company\r\nof 1872. The American Transfer Company was ostensibly a pipe line, and\r\nthe railroad officials met the exposure of their \"nothing peculiar\"\r\ndealings with it by asserting that the payment to it of 22-1/2 cents a\r\nbarrel and more was for its service in collecting oil and delivering\r\nit to them; but the Third Vice-President of the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nadmits that his road paid the money on oil which the American Transfer\r\nCompany never handled.\r\n\r\n\"This 22-1/2 cents (a barrel) paid the American Transfer Company is not\r\nrestricted to oil that passed through their lines?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; it is paid on all oil received and transported by us.\"[165]\r\n\r\nThe American Transfer Company was not even a pipe line. By the\r\nPennsylvania laws all incorporated pipe lines must report their\r\noperations and condition monthly to the State. But the publisher of the\r\npetroleum trade reports, and organizer of a bureau of information about\r\npetroleum, with offices in Oil City, London, and New York, issuing\r\ndaily reports, testified that the American Transfer Company was not\r\nknown in the oil regions at all as a pipe line. It published none of\r\nthe statements required by law. \"They do not,\" he said, \"make any runs\r\nfrom the oil-wells.\" It had once been a pipe line, but \"years ago it\r\nwas merged in with other lines,\" and consolidated into the United Pipe\r\nLine, owned and operated by the combination.[166]\r\n\r\nWhen this arrangement was exposed to public view by the New York\r\nlegislative investigation, the \"expert\" who appeared to explain it away\r\nin behalf of the railroads and their beneficiaries, paraded a false map\r\nof the pipe-line system, drawn and colored to make it seem that the\r\nAmerican Transfer Company was a very important pipe-line.[167] This was\r\nthe same \"expert\" who, as we saw, defended the pipe-line holocaust of\r\n1874 by asserting that \"all were to be taken in alike.\"\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of liars, an eminent judge of New York is fond of\r\nsaying--liars, damned liars, and experts.\r\n\r\nWhen the assistant secretary of the oil combination was asked about\r\nthis \"transfer\" company, he replied, \"I don't know anything about\r\nthe organization.\"[168] He had described himself to the committee as\r\n\"a clamorer for dividends\"; but he declared he knew nothing about an\r\norganization which was \"transferring\" him dividends at the rate of\r\n$3,093,750 a year on $100,000 of capital. Almost at the very moment\r\nof this denial, receipts were being produced in court in Pennsylvania\r\nwhich had been given by the cashier of himself and his associates to\r\nthe railroads for this money.[169]\r\n\r\nEven if the independents succeeded in saving their oil from wasting on\r\nthe ground, and got it into pipe lines, and had it refined, and were\r\nlucky enough to be given cars to carry it to the seaboard, they found\r\nthat in leaving the oil regions they had not left behind the \"no.\" Up\r\nto the very edge of the sea were the nets spread for them.\r\n\r\nPart of the bargain of 1872 had been that the brothers of the South\r\nImprovement Company should provide the terminal facilities at the\r\nseaboard.[170] Railroad companies are usually supposed to have their\r\nown yards, storehouses, wharves, and the like, and, as a matter of\r\nfact, the railroads had these. The agreement of 1872 that the South\r\nImprovement Company should furnish the terminal facilities meant--it\r\nwas discovered by the New York Legislature in 1879--that such terminals\r\nas the road already had should be turned over to that concern, and that\r\nthereafter nobody should be allowed to build or use terminals except as\r\nit permitted.\r\n\r\nThe New York Legislature found, in 1879, that the oil combination\r\nthus owned and controlled the oil terminal facilities of the four\r\ntrunk-lines at New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\"They can use the power here given, and have used it to crush out\r\nopposition.\"[171]\r\n\r\n\"Of course, there is in the Erie contract a statement that every\r\nshipper of oil over the road shall be treated with 'fairness' by the\r\nStandard Oil Company, and our attention was drawn to that,\" the counsel\r\nof the Chamber of Commerce said.... \"In the first place, they have the\r\nexclusive shipment of oil, and therefore nobody could ship oil, and\r\nthere was no oil handled for anybody else; but if the Erie Company\r\nshould send some for somebody else, why, the sloop could not get to the\r\ndock, and the machinery at the dock would not and could not work by\r\nany possibility so as to get that oil out of that dock and into a ship\r\n(except at the end of a lawsuit).\"[172]\r\n\r\nEvidently the \"cancellation\" of 1872 had not cancelled anything of\r\nsubstance. Indeed, the \"no\" of 1878 was wider than the embargo of 1872,\r\nfor the fourth great trunk-line, the Baltimore and Ohio, was not one of\r\nthe signatories then; but by 1878 it had, like all the others, closed\r\nits port to the people--farming it out as the old régime farmed out the\r\nright to tax provinces.\r\n\r\nHe used to meet the president of the oil combination \"frequently in the\r\nErie office,\" a friend and subordinate has recalled.[173] Railroad\r\noffices are pleasant places to visit when such plums are to be gathered\r\nthere as this of the sole right to the freedom of all ports and control\r\nof the commerce of three continents.\r\n\r\nDown to this writing, when the little group of independents who remain\r\nmasters of their own refineries along Oil Creek seek to send their oil\r\nin bulk abroad, or to transship it at any one of the principal ports\r\nfor other points on the coast, the same power still says the same \"no\"\r\nas twenty years ago.[174]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWHO PIPED AND WHO DANCED\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, by 1878, the independent producers and refiners found themselves\r\ncaught in a battue like rabbits driven in for the sport of a Prince of\r\nWales.\r\n\r\nIf the richest person then in America--that artificial but very real\r\nperson the Pennsylvania Railroad--could not keep its pipe lines, nobody\r\ncould. The war for the union, which ended with its surrender in 1877,\r\nclosed the pipe-line industry to the people. The unanimous \"no\" of all\r\nthe railroads which followed completed the corral.\r\n\r\nOil, when it got to market, found that those who had become the owners\r\nof the pipe lines were also the owners of most of the refineries, and\r\nso the only large buyers.[175] \"Practically to-day there is but one\r\nbuyer of crude oil for us.... We take our commodity to one buyer; we\r\ntake the price he chooses to give us without redress, with no right of\r\nappeal.\"[176]\r\n\r\nThen the sole carrier--the pipe-line company--refused to take the oil\r\ninto its pipes--the oil as it came out of the wells--unless first sold\r\nto its other self, the oil combination. This was called \"immediate\r\nshipment.\" Forced to waste or sell his oil, the producer, under this\r\ncompulsion, had to take what he could get.[177] The Hon. Lewis Emery,\r\nJr., a member of the State Senate of Pennsylvania, gave the authorities\r\nof the State an account of the \"immediate shipment\" evolution of\r\nAmerican market liberty. \"We go down,\" he said, \"to the office and\r\nstand in a line, sometimes half a day--people in a line reaching out\r\ninto the street--sixty and seventy of us. When our turn comes we go in\r\nand ask them to buy, and they graciously will take it. I am an owner in\r\nsix different companies, and we all suffer the same.\"\r\n\r\nTo educate the producer to sell \"always below the market,\" the Pipe\r\nLine let his oil spill itself on the ground for a few days. \"We lost a\r\nconsiderable amount of oil, probably several thousand barrels,\" another\r\nproducer said.\r\n\r\n\"Will you state at what price as compared with the market price,\r\nwhether above or below, you sold that oil?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was always below.\"\r\n\r\nAsked why he sold it below the market, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Because the line would not run it until it was sold.\"[178]\r\n\r\nThe hills of Pennsylvania began to growl and redden as in 1872.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Internal Affairs was hung in effigy. Mass meetings\r\nwere held--some tumultuous, others quiet; processions of masked men\r\nmarched the streets, and groaned and hooted in front of the newspaper\r\noffices and the business places of the combination. In the morning the\r\nstreets and sidewalks were frequently found placarded with cabalistic\r\nsigns and letters, and occasionally printed proclamations and warnings.\r\nMost of the lending newspapers of the region had been either absolutely\r\npurchased by the oil combination or paid to keep silence. Others\r\noccasionally broke forth in violent articles advising the use of\r\nforce.[179]\r\n\r\nIn the McKean County field the people rose in rebellion. They got up a\r\nPhantom Party, in its provocation and spirit much like a phantom party\r\nwhich, contrary to law and order, boarded some ships in Boston harbor a\r\ncentury before. One thousand men, wrapped in white sheets, marched by\r\nnight from Tarport to Bradford, the headquarters in that province of\r\nthe sole buyer. Not a word was spoken.\r\n\r\nIt was not enough to make the people sell under compulsion. A day\r\ncame when the only buyer would not buy and the only piper would not\r\npipe. This brought the Parker district to the verge of civil war. The\r\ncitizens were in a state of terrible excitement; the pipe lines would\r\nnot run oil unless it was sold; the only buyers--viz., the agents of\r\nthe oil combination--would not buy oil, stating that they could not get\r\ncars; hundreds of wells were stopped to their great injury. Thousands\r\nmore, whose owners were afraid to stop them for fear of damage by salt\r\nwater, were pumping the oil on the ground. The leaders used all the\r\ninfluence they had to prevent an outbreak and destruction of railroad\r\nand pipe lines. The most important of them went over to the Allegheny\r\nValley Railroad office and telegraphed to the president: \"The refusal\r\nto run oil unless sold upon immediate shipment and of the railroad to\r\nfurnish cars has created such a degree of excitement here that the\r\nmost conservative part of the citizens will not be able to control the\r\npeace, and I fear that the scenes of last July will be repeated on an\r\naggravated scale.\"[180]\r\n\r\nThree of the highest officials of the road sought an immediate\r\ninterview with this leader of the producers. He warned them, and the\r\nPennsylvania road which controlled their oil business, that unless\r\nimmediate relief were furnished there would be an outbreak in the\r\noil regions, because, as he told them, \"The idea of a scarcity of\r\ncars on daily shipments of less than 30,000 barrels a day was such an\r\nabsurd, barefaced pretence, that he could not expect men of ordinary\r\nintelligence to accept any excuses for the absence of cars, as the\r\npreceding fall, when business required, the railroads could carry day\r\nafter day from 50,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil.\"[181] The warning was\r\nheeded. Thousands of empty cars, which the combination and its railroad\r\nallies had said couldn't be had anywhere, suddenly appeared hastening\r\nto Parker, blocking up the tracks in all directions, deranging the\r\npassenger business of the road. \"They looked like mosquitoes coming\r\nout of a swamp.\" The sole buyer began buying again, and for the whole\r\nweek, after having declared themselves unable to buy or move any, the\r\nrailroads moved 50,000 barrels a day.[182] Producers under such rule\r\nsaw their prices decrease and their land pass out of their possession,\r\nas was inevitable.\r\n\r\nTen years later in the Ohio oil-field all the substantial features\r\nof the plan we saw culminate at Parker are to be found in full play.\r\nThere, also, the oil combination, Congress was told, is the only\r\npurchaser, and it fixes the price to suit itself. The production of\r\nthe Ohio fields was between 18,000 and 20,000 barrels a day, but it\r\ncould easily produce between 30,000 and 32,000. Because the only buyer\r\nrefused to take care of the oil, wells have been shut back. Wells,\r\nwhich if opened up would run 1000 or 2000 or even more, were shut in\r\nfour days out of the week.[183]\r\n\r\nThis culmination of 1878 made the people act. The producers were being\r\nground to powder by the fact that an enemy had possession of their\r\nlocal pipes, their tankage, and their railways. \"I am the unfortunate\r\nowner,\" said one of them, \"of interests in nearly one hundred pumping\r\nwells. I have produced over half a million barrels of oil.\"[184] Oil\r\nwas running out of the ground at the rate of 15,000,000 barrels a year,\r\nbut the New York refiners who were in command of plenty of capital,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"We don't dare build large refineries, for we don't know where we could\r\nget the oil.\"[185]\r\n\r\nAt last the people organized the Tidewater Pipe Line. This was the\r\nfirst successful attempt to realize the idea often broached of a pipe\r\nline to the seaboard. It was the last hope of the \"outsiders\"--the\r\n\"independents.\" \"Nothing short of the ingenuity that is born of\r\nnecessity and desperation\" produced that pipe line. It was well\r\ncontrived and well manned, and had plenty of money. It was organized in\r\n1878, with a capital of $1,000,000, which increased in a few years to\r\n$5,000,000. It built a pipe from the oil regions to Williamsport--105\r\nmiles--on the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, whence the oil\r\nwas carried in cars by that company and over the Jersey Central to\r\nPhiladelphia and New York.\r\n\r\nUnlimited capital and strategy did all that could be done against the\r\nTidewater. At one place, to head it off, a strip of land barring its\r\nprogress was bought entirely across a valley. It escaped by climbing\r\nthe hills. At another point it had to cross under a railroad. The\r\nrailroad officers forbade. Riding around, almost in despair, its\r\nengineer saw a culvert where there was no watercourse. It was for a\r\nright of passage which a farmer, whose land was cut in two by the\r\nrailroad, had reserved in perpetuity for driving his cattle in safety\r\nto pasture. It did not take long to make a bargain with the farmer for\r\npermission to lay the pipe there.\r\n\r\nThe pipe line was finished and ready to move oil about the 1st of June,\r\n1879. On June 5th a meeting was held at Saratoga of representatives\r\nof the four trunk-line railroads and of members of the oil trust. The\r\nmeeting decided that the new competitor should be fought to the death.\r\nThe rate on oil, which had been $1.15 a barrel, was reduced to 80,\r\nthen to 30, to 20, to 15 cents by the railroads, to make the business\r\nunprofitable enough to ruin this first attempt to pipe oil to the\r\nseaboard. Finally the roads carried a barrel, weighing 390 pounds, 400\r\nmiles for the combination for 10 cents or less.[186] The representative\r\nof the Tidewater offered to prove to Congress, in 1880, if it would\r\norder an investigation--which it would not--that \"the announced and\r\nostensible object of the conference at Saratoga was to destroy the\r\ncredit of the Tidewater, and to enable the oil combination to buy up\r\nthe new pipe line, and that a time was fixed by the combination within\r\nwhich it promised to secure the control of the pipe line--provided\r\nthe trunk-lines would make the rates for carrying oil so low that all\r\nconcerned in transportation would lose money.[187] There can be no\r\ndoubt,\" he continued, \"that, taking the avowed and ostensible object of\r\nthe Saratoga meeting as the true one, it constituted, on the part of\r\nthe willing participants, a criminal conspiracy of the most dangerous\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the chief officials of the Pennsylvania Railroad testified to\r\nthe competition which his road had carried on with the Tidewater.\r\n\"It certainly was fought,\" he said; \"the rates were considerably\r\nreduced.\"[188] Rates were put down to points so low that the railroad\r\nmen would never tell what they were. I have no knowledge--I have no\r\nrecollection--was all the president and general freight agent of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad could be got to say, when before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission.[189] \"Not enough to pay for the wheel grease,\"\r\nsaid the general freight agent.[190] The oil trust also cut the prices\r\nof pipeage by its local lines from 20 cents to 5 cents a barrel,\r\nturning cheapness into the enemy of cheapness.\r\n\r\nBut the Tidewater was strong enough to withstand even so formidable\r\nan assault as this. As its business was small, its losses were small;\r\nbut the railroads, making this war on it for the benefit of others,\r\nsuffered heavily. The trunk-lines, it has been calculated, wilfully\r\nthrew away profits equal to $10,000,000 a year for the sake of\r\ninflicting a loss of $100,000 on the pipe lines.[191] Enough revenue\r\nwas lost to pay dividends of 2-1/2 to 5 per cent. on the total capital\r\nof the roads.\r\n\r\nOne effect that followed this reduction in rates was a corresponding\r\ndecline in the price of oil at New York, in which the cost of freight\r\nis a constant element. The Committee of the New York Legislature found\r\nin the testimony it heard reason to believe that the members of the oil\r\ntrust took advantage of their advance knowledge to sell at high prices,\r\nto those who did not know, all they would buy for future delivery.\r\n\r\nThe \"Hepburn\" report of the New York Legislature of 1879 gives special\r\nprominence to the computations that $1,500,000 were the profits of this\r\nspeculative deal.[192]\r\n\r\nThe customers of the Tidewater, the independent refiners in\r\nPhiladelphia, were charged by the Pennsylvania Railroad on oil\r\nthat came through the Tidewater 15 cents a barrel for one mile of\r\nhauling. The utmost the law allowed them was half a cent a mile, and\r\nthey were carrying oil 500 miles to New York for the same charge of\r\n15 cents a barrel, and less. Under such pressure these independent\r\nrefineries, which the Tidewater had been built to supply, sold out\r\none after another. The Tidewater was then in the position of a great\r\ntransporting company, that had spent a large amount of money to\r\nbring a great product to its Philadelphia terminus, and found that\r\nrefining establishments which had been begging it to give them oil had\r\nbecome the cohorts of its opponent. To meet this the Tidewater built\r\nrefineries of its own at Chester, and at Bayonne, New Jersey, on New\r\nYork waters.\r\n\r\nWhen asked for a rate to another point, the Pennsylvania gave one that\r\nwas three and four times as much as they would charge the oil trust,\r\nbut added, \"we cannot make a rate on the empty cars returning.\" That\r\nis, as it was interpreted, \"we will carry the oil, but we will not\r\npermit the empty cars to come over the roads to get the oil. They must\r\nbe taken on a wheelbarrow, or by canal, or by balloon.\"[193] The war\r\nwent on. Attempts were made to seduce the officials of the Tidewater.\r\nA stockholder, who had been too poor to pay for his stock, received a\r\nlarge sum from the oil combination and began a vexatious suit for a\r\nreceivership.[194] A minority forced their way into the offices of the\r\ncompany, and took violent possession of it by a \"farcical, fraudulent,\r\nand void\" election, as the court decided in annulling it. Its financial\r\ncredit was attacked in the money market and by injunctions against its\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\nAffidavits were offered from members of the oil combination denying\r\nthat they had had anything to do with these proceedings. In reference\r\nto these affidavits, the representative of the Tidewater reminded the\r\ncourt that that combination was a multifarious body. \"One-half of\r\nthem,\" he said, \"do a thing, and the other half swear they know nothing\r\nabout it. In pursuance of this Machiavelian policy, they have eight or\r\nten gentlemen to conduct negotiations, and eight or ten to say they do\r\nnot know anything about them.\"\r\n\r\nThen, with no visible cause, the capacity of the pipe fell below the\r\ndemands upon it. This insufficient capacity was pleaded in court as\r\none of the reasons why the pipe should be taken out of the hands of\r\nits owners. One day the cause was discovered--a plug of wood. Some\r\nmysterious hand had been set to drive a square block of wood into the\r\npipe so as to cut down its capacity to one-third. The representative\r\nof the Tidewater declared in court his belief that this plug had been\r\nplaced by \"people on the other side who have made affidavits in this\r\ncase.\" A similar deed, but much worse, as it might have cost many\r\nlives, was done during the contest with Toledo, nine years later.[195]\r\n\r\nThe Tidewater was successful, but not successful enough. It owned 400\r\nmiles of pipe, including the 105 miles of the trunk-line, and had\r\ncontrol of nearly 3,000,000 barrels of tankage. It did a great work\r\nfor the people. \"It was,\" the Philadelphia _Press_ said, in 1883,\r\n\"the child of war. It has been a barrier between the producers and\r\nthe monopoly which would crush them if it dared.\" While these words\r\nof exultation were being penned, a surrender was under negotiation.\r\nThe Tidewater's managers were nearly worn out. These tactics of\r\ncorrupting their officers, slandering their credit, buying up their\r\ncustomers, stealing their elections, garroting them with lawsuits\r\nfounded on falsehoods, shutting them off the railroads, and plugging\r\nup their pipe in the dark, were too much. They entered into a pool.\r\nThe two companies in the summer of 1883 \"recognized\" each other, as\r\nthe trunk lines do, and agreed to divide the business in proportions,\r\nwhich would net the Tidewater $500,000 a year. The announcement that\r\nthis pool had been forced on the Tidewater fell like a death-blow\r\non the people of the oil regions. \"The Tidewater,\" the Philadelphia\r\n_Press_ said, editorially, \"will probably retain a nominal identity\r\nas a corporation, but its usefulness to the public and its claim to\r\npopular confidence and encouragement were extinguished the instant it\r\nconsented to enter into alliance with the unscrupulous monopoly which\r\nresorts to that means of conciliating and bribing what it had failed\r\nto destroy.\" As was anticipated by the _Press_, the Tidewater retained\r\nits nominal identity, but that was all. Its surrender was admitted by\r\nits principal organizer, Mr. Franklin B. Gowen. The officials of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad have testified to it. \"They made an arrangement\r\nof some kind, the conditions of which I never knew; one swallowed the\r\nother or both swallowed the other, or something, and settled up their\r\ndifficulties,\"[196] said the general freight agent. The president said:\r\n\"The competition between these pipe lines ceased.\"[197]\r\n\r\nThe attorney of the Tidewater was asked if there were any negotiations\r\nwhich resulted in a compromise of the differences with the oil\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n\"If by differences,\" he replied, \"you mean competition in trade, I\r\nanswer the question, yes. That resulted in a written contract.... The\r\npurpose of the contract was to settle the rivalry in business between\r\nthe two companies, each company to take a percentage of transportation\r\nand gathering, and each to do with the oil as it saw fit.\"[198]\r\n\r\nThe treasurer of the Tidewater, who had been in its service since 1880,\r\ncorroborated its attorney. A contract had been made between the two;\r\nthe date of it was October 9, 1883. Copies of the contracts are in the\r\nauthor's possession.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission in 1892 judicially found the same\r\nfact. It says: \"About December, 1883, the pipe lines, with the view of\r\ngetting better rates, adjusted their differences, and the competition\r\nbetween them ceased. The pipe-line business appears then to have passed\r\ninto the control of the National Transit Company.\"[199] All but 6\r\nper cent. of the National Transit Company is owned by the oil trust.\r\nIt formed practically one-third the imposing bulk of the $70,000,000\r\nof the trust of 1882.[200] If anything can be made certain by human\r\ntestimony this evidence proves that these pipe lines stopped competing\r\nin 1883. The witnesses are the men who negotiated the contract,\r\nand upon whose approval it depended. But when the president of the\r\ntrust was asked under oath, in 1888, if there were any pipe lines to\r\ntide-water competing with it, he named, as \"a competing company,\" \"the\r\nTidewater Pipe Line.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Tidewater Company? Does that compete with your company?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in opposition to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in opposition to it.\"[201]\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit he denied, in 1883, that he had anything to do with\r\nthe company which had represented the oil trust in this \"swallowing or\r\nsomething\" of the Tidewater. This, the National Transit Company, was\r\nthe most important member of the trust. Under its cover, by means like\r\nthose described, from New York to West Virginia and Ohio, almost all\r\nthe pipes for gathering and distributing oil have been brought into one\r\nownership. Millions yearly of the earnings of this company were pooled\r\nwith all the others in the trust, and the president was receiving\r\nhis share of them four times a year. He was the sole attorney[202]\r\nauthorized to sign contracts for the trustees, who thus held all the\r\ncombined companies in a common control. These trustees, of whom he was\r\nthe chief, not only controlled but owned as their personal property\r\nmore than half the stock of every company represented. But these facts\r\nwere not then known to the public. It was not intended that they should\r\nbe known, as the struggle to conceal them from the New York Legislature\r\nfive years later--in 1888--showed.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any connection with the National Transit Company?\" he was\r\nasked, after taking the oath.\r\n\r\n\"I have not.\"[203]\r\n\r\nWhen the Tidewater passed under this alien control, Mr. Franklin B.\r\nGowen severed all his connection with it. He did not hold himself\r\nfor sale to any man who had money to pay fees. He stood at a height\r\nwhere the profession of law was immeasurably above prostitution in the\r\ntemples of justice--the odious aspect in which the sacrifice of purity\r\nin the ancient temples of Aphrodite is reproduced in our courts. It\r\nwould have been impossible for him to combine the functions of a great\r\nlaw reformer and procurer of judicial virtue for railroad corporation\r\nwreckers. He never forgot what some successful lawyers seem never to\r\nremember--that the lawyer is, as much as the judge, an officer of the\r\ncourt and of justice. While he lived he was proud to be recognized\r\nas the chief defender in the courts of the rights of those whom it\r\nwas sought to crush in this industry, although he thus allied himself\r\nwith the poor and heavy laden. He could have used his anti-monopoly\r\neloquence as an advertisement of his value to monopoly; but he would\r\nnot sell his soul to fill his stomach. His heart revolted against the\r\nwicked cruelty with which he saw the strong misuse the weak, and his\r\npenetrating vision saw clearly the ruin to which overgrown power and\r\nconscienceless greed were hurrying the liberties of his country. In his\r\nspeech before the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1883, advocating a law to\r\nprevent the use of railway power by railway officials to redistribute\r\nthe property of the people among their favorites, he said, speaking of\r\nwhat had been done in the oil regions of Pennsylvania: \"If such a state\r\nof facts as I now call your attention to had been permitted by any\r\ngovernment in Europe or Asia for a six months, instead of the sixteen\r\nyears it has existed in this Commonwealth, the crown and sceptre of\r\nits ruler would have been ground into the dust, and yet the good,\r\nhonest, patient, long-suffering people have submitted to it in this\r\nCommonwealth until the time has come that if we hold our peace the very\r\nstones will cry out.\r\n\r\n\"I for one intend to submit to it no longer. You may say it is unwise\r\nfor me to attack this wrong, but I have attacked it before and I will\r\nattack it again. If I could only throw off the other burdens that rest\r\nupon my shoulders, I would feel it to be my duty to preach resistance\r\nto this great wrong, as Peter the Hermit preached the crusade. I would\r\ngo through this State from Lake Erie to the Delaware; I would go into\r\nevery part of this Commonwealth and endeavor, by the plain recital\r\nof the facts, to raise up such a feeling and such a power as would\r\nmake itself heard and felt, and by the fair, open, honest, and proper\r\nenforcement of the law, right the wrong, and teach the guilty authors\r\nof this infamous tyranny\r\n\r\n   \"'That truth remembered long:\r\n When once their slumbering passions waked,\r\n     The peaceful are the strong.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gowen bravely fulfilled his pledge not to submit. His principal\r\noccupation became the championship in the courts and the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission of those who were oppressed by this crushing\r\npower. His incorruptible lance was always in place, until the morning\r\nhe was found dead in his room in Washington.\r\n\r\nThe oil combination had, up to this time, sent all its oil east by\r\nrail as it had no pipe line, and its faithful fools, the railroads,\r\ntherefore burned their fingers with joy to roast the Tidewater for so\r\ngood a customer. But while the railroad officials were wasting their\r\nemployers' property to destroy the combination's new competitor, its\r\nastute managers, seeing how good a thing pipe lines were, quietly\r\nbuilt a system of their own to the seaboard. The railroads had helped\r\nthem get hold of the pipe lines--had in repeated cases, as the Erie,\r\nthe Atlantic and Great Western, the Pennsylvania, the Cleveland and\r\nMarietta did, allowed them to lay their pipes on the lands of the\r\nrailroads--and were now to see the pipe lines used to replace the\r\nrailroads in the transportation of oil. These oil men saw what the\r\nrailroad men had not the wit to see--or else lacked the virtue to live\r\nup to--that the pipe line is an oil railway. It requires no cars and\r\nno locomotives; it moves oil without risk of fire or loss; it is very\r\nmuch cheaper than the ordinary railway, for this freight moves itself\r\nafter being lifted up by pumps. The pipe line was the sure competitor\r\nof the railway, fated to be either its servant or master, as the\r\nrailroad chose to use it or lose it. The railways sentimentally helped\r\nthe trust to gather these rival transportation lines into its hands;\r\nthen the trust, with the real genius of conquest, threw the railroads\r\nto one side. A system of trunk-line pipes was at once pushed vigorously\r\nto completion in all directions. While the members of the oil trust\r\nwere building these pipe lines to take away the oil business of the\r\nrailroads, the officials of the latter were giving them by rebates the\r\nmoney to do it with. At the expense of their own employers, the owners\r\nof the railroads, these freight agents and general managers presented\r\nto the monopoly, out of the freight earnings of the oil business, the\r\nmoney with which to build the pipe lines that would destroy that branch\r\nof the business of the roads.\r\n\r\nIt was the Tidewater that proved the feasibility of trunk pipe lines.\r\nThe trunk pipe lines the combination has built were in imitation.\r\nExtraordinary pains have been taken to sophisticate public opinion\r\nwith regard to all these matters--for the ignorance of the public is\r\nthe real capital of monopoly--and with great success. The history we\r\nhave transcribed from the public records is refined by one of the\r\ncombination into the following illuminant:\r\n\r\n\"About 1879 or 1880 it was discovered that railways were inadequate to\r\nthe task of getting oil to the seaboard as rapidly as needed. Combined\r\ncapital and energy were equal to the emergency. No need to detail how\r\nit was done. To-day there reaches,\"[204] etc., etc. It must have been\r\non some such authority that this, from one of our leading religious\r\njournals, was founded: \"Only by such union\"--of the refiners--\"could\r\npipe lines have been laid from the oil wells to the tide-water,\r\nreducing to the smallest amount the cost of transportation.\"[205] An\r\naccount of the pipe-line system in the New York _Sun_, of December 14,\r\n1887, describing the operations of the great pumps that force the oil\r\nthrough the pipes, says: \"Every time the piston of the engine passes\r\nforward and back a barrel of oil is sent seaward. A barrel of oil is\r\nforced on its way every seven seconds of every hour of the twenty-four.\r\nEvery pulsation of the gigantic pumps that are throbbing ceaselessly\r\nday and night is known and numbered at headquarters in New York at the\r\nclose of each day's business.\" This heart of a machine, beating at the\r\nheadquarters in New York, and numbering its beats day and night, stands\r\nfor thousands of hearts whose throbs of hope have been transmuted into\r\nthis metallic substitute. This heart counts out a gold dollar for every\r\ndrop of blood that used to run through the living breasts of the men\r\nwho divined, projected, accomplished, and lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCHEAPENING TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough all the tangle of this piping and dancing one thread runs\r\nclear. The oil combination had up to this time been dependent on the\r\nrailroads for transportation, but it emerged out of the fracas the\r\nprincipal transporter of oil, made so by the railroads. It now had two\r\ntrunk pipe lines to the sea-coast--the one it had conquered and the one\r\nit had built--and the railroads had made it a present of both of them.\r\n\r\nThe Tidewater--the first seaboard pipe line--had been built only\r\nbecause the Pennsylvania and other trunk lines had said \"no\" to every\r\nentreaty and demand of the oil regions for a road to the sea. That line\r\nthe railroads had conquered for the combination, as they conquered for\r\nit the pipe lines of the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1877. The second\r\nseaboard pipe line was built by the combination with the railroads'\r\nmoney to take away the railroads' business, and best--or worst--of all,\r\nwhile the railroads were hard at work driving the Tidewater into its\r\nnet. Such is the business genius of our \"railroad kings.\"\r\n\r\nThis campaign closed, the duty of the hour for the oil ring was to get\r\nrates advanced by rail as well as pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Then they\"--the pipe lines--\"were anxious to get good paying\r\nrates,\"[206] so that they could make a good thing out of the business\r\nof their own pipe and of the Tidewater which they had guaranteed\r\n$500,000 a year. The advent of the independent Tidewater had brought\r\nrates down. The restoration of exclusive control by its capture put\r\nrates up. But it was not enough for the oil combination to advance\r\ntheir own rates. It must induce the railroads to do the same. The\r\nrailroads had furnished the means for the acquisition of both pipes,\r\nand they must now be got to drive business away from themselves to\r\nthese competing oil railways. This would seem to be a delicate matter\r\nto achieve, but there was no trouble about it.\r\n\r\n\"It is our pleasure to try to make oil cheap,\"[207] the president of\r\nthe oil trust told Congress, but it did not use its new facilities\r\nto take in hand at reduced cost the carriage of all oil, and give\r\nthe industry the economic advantage of the pipe-line idea. Quite the\r\ncontrary. It united with the railroads to increase the cost. Under this\r\nnew blow the independent refiners and producers whom the Tidewater\r\nhad been built to keep afloat grounded again. Then the railroads--the\r\nPennsylvania especially--repented of what they had done to these their\r\noldest customers, and sent ambassadors to them to renew the broken\r\npromises of 1872, that if they would rebuild they should forever\r\nhave equal rates and fair treatment. One of the highest officials of\r\nthe Pennsylvania was sent to them to say: We recognize our error in\r\npermitting your refineries to be abandoned and the traffic destroyed.\r\nWe wish to build up and maintain independent refining in the oil\r\nregions. We will give you every encouragement. We will insure you equal\r\nrates, on which you can ship and live.[208]\r\n\r\nThese invitations and guarantees were repeated and pressed. They were\r\nrenewed by the officials of the Erie also: \"You need have no hesitation\r\nin building up your business,\" said the officials of the Erie; \"You\r\nshall have living rates.\"[209]\r\n\r\nThe independents listened and believed. They rebuilt their works and\r\nprospered.[210] This meant the return of cheapness--cheapness of\r\ntransportation over the railroads, to enable the refiners they had\r\ninvited back to life to compete in the market--cheapness of light.\r\nThereupon, incredible as it seems, the Pennsylvania and the other\r\nrailroads were influenced to declare war again upon the men who had\r\nreinvested their money and their life energy in response to these\r\nsolicitations. This new war began with a secret contract, in 1885, for\r\nan advance in rates against the independent refiners, who, in trustful\r\nreliance on the pledged faith of the railroads, had developed their\r\ncapacity to 2,000,000 barrels a year.[211]\r\n\r\nThis campaign has lasted from 1885 until the present writing, 1894. In\r\nit the pipe lines, the oil combination, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and\r\nall the other great carriers between the independents and their markets\r\nin New England, Europe, and Asia, have been mobilized into a fighting\r\ncorps for the annihilation of the independents. This case illustrates\r\nnearly every phase of the story of our great monopoly: dearness instead\r\nof cheapness; willingness of the managers of transportation to deny\r\ntransportation to whole trades and sections; administration of great\r\nproperties like the Pennsylvania Railroad in direct opposition to\r\nthe interests of the owners--to their great loss--for the benefit\r\nof favorites of the officials; great wealth thereby procured by\r\ndestruction, as if by physical force, of wealth of others, not at\r\nall by creation of new wealth to be added to the general store;\r\nimpossibility of survival in modern business of men who are merely\r\nhonest, hard-working, competent, even though they have skill, capital,\r\nand customers; subjection of the majority of citizens and dollars to\r\na small minority in numbers and riches; subservience of rulers of the\r\npeople to a faction; last and most disheartening, the impotence of the\r\nspecial tribunal created to enforce the rights of the people on their\r\nhighways.\r\n\r\nThis secret contract of 1885 was thus described by the counsel of the\r\nrefiners before the Interstate Commerce Commission: \"It is a contract,\"\r\nhe said, \"so vicious and illegal that the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nrefuses to bring it into court for fear a disclosure of its terms might\r\nsubject it to a criminal prosecution.\"\r\n\r\nThe courts have never been allowed to see it, but its provisions are\r\nknown. Some of them were admitted before the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission to be what was charged, and others were described on the\r\ntrial by the counsel of the independents from personal knowledge. By\r\nthis contract the railroad and the oil combination bound themselves to\r\nadvance rates, and to keep them the same by pipe and rail. In return\r\nfor this pledge by the railroad not to compete it was guaranteed\r\none-quarter--26 per cent.--of the oil business to the seaboard. The\r\nPennsylvania Railroad made no attempt to deny that it had made this\r\ncontract. It admitted that it had an arrangement \"substantially the\r\nsame as stated.\"[212]\r\n\r\nThe combination was the largest shipper of oil, and yet it wanted\r\nfreight rates advanced. It had pipe lines which could easily take to\r\nthe seaboard all the oil that went thither, and yet it gave up a large\r\npart of the business to the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad knew that the pipe line was a competitor for the carriage of\r\noil, and yet allowed it to dictate an arrangement by which the railroad\r\ngot only one-quarter of the business, and signed away its rights to win\r\na larger share if it could.\r\n\r\nThe railroad had persuaded the independent refiners to settle along its\r\nline by solemnly promising them fair and living rates, and yet now put\r\nits corporate seal to an agreement to make those rates whatever their\r\nenemy wanted them to be. Such was its honor. As for its shrewdness,\r\nthat had at last brought it to this humiliation in a business where\r\nit had once been chief, of confining itself to this insignificant\r\nquarter of a restricted traffic instead of a competitive share of a\r\ntraffic enlarged by freedom to the widest correspondence to the wants\r\nof the people. The mastery of the railroad men by the oil people was\r\nthorough. The latter did not agree to give the railroad one-quarter\r\nof their business. Not at all. All the traffic that came of itself to\r\nthe railroad, or which its freight solicitors drummed up, must be put\r\nto the credit of the guarantee. All that was promised the railroad was\r\nthat its total should amount to one-quarter of the whole traffic. All\r\nthe rest the oil combination kept for itself.\r\n\r\nThe contract went at once into vigorous operation. Freight rates to\r\nthe seaboard, which had been 34 cents, and, as was proved before the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, were profitable, were advanced to 52\r\ncents a barrel--an increase of one-half. The railroad and the pipe line\r\nmade the raise in concert, as had been agreed, and when the rates were\r\nchanged again it was to still higher figures. Why should the clique,\r\nwhich had its principal refineries at the seaboard--to which it had\r\nto transport large quantities of oil--scheme in this way to raise the\r\nrates of transportation? Because it paid this excessive rate on only a\r\nsmall part of its own shipments, and compelled its rivals to pay it on\r\nall of theirs. The independents had no pipe line of their own, but the\r\ncombination sent its own oil east by its own pipe line, excepting only\r\nthe quantity it needed to add to the shipments over the Pennsylvania to\r\nmake good its guarantee to that railroad of one-quarter of the traffic.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the pipe-line service to its owners is very small. When the\r\nmanager of the pipe lines was before the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nthe lawyers of the railroads, as zealous for the oil combination,\r\nthough it was not a party in the case, as for their own clients, fought\r\nthrough eleven pages of argument against having him compelled to tell\r\nthe cost of pumping oil through the pipe to the seaboard; and when\r\nthe Commission finally said, \"Go on,\" all the general manager of the\r\npipe lines had to say was, \"I do not believe that it is possible to\r\nknow.\"[213]\r\n\r\nFinally, he was cornered into an estimate that the cost of pumping was\r\n6 or 7 cents a barrel. His questioner, who had been the organizer and\r\nmanager of a great pipe line--the Tidewater--knew that oil had been\r\npumped through for 4 cents a barrel, but he could not get his witness,\r\nwho, no doubt, had done it still cheaper, to admit anything of the kind.\r\n\r\nThe net effect of this pool with the railroad was that the oil\r\ncombination succeeded in making its rivals pay 64 cents a barrel to\r\nreach the East and the seaboard, while it paid only 16[214]--except on\r\nthe traffic guaranteed the Pennsylvania Railroad--a difference against\r\ncompetition of 48 cents a barrel, a difference not for cheapness. \"It\r\nonly costs the pipe line 7 cents,\" the independents explained to the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, \"and the published rate is 52. They are\r\nwilling to pay 52 or even 70 cents on some of their product if they can\r\nmake the other people pay 52 upon the whole of theirs.\"\r\n\r\nSo much of the contract as we have referred to was admitted. Why was\r\nit, then, the counsel for the railroad fought against showing it, even\r\nto the point of pleading that it might incriminate his client?[215]\r\nIt was asserted, as of his personal knowledge, by the counsel of the\r\nindependents that this was because another part of the bargain gave the\r\nproof that the rates which had been made under the agreement to put\r\nthem up and keep them up were extortionate; that by a bargain within\r\nthe bargain the oil combination carried oil for the railroad for the\r\n280 miles for which they ran practically side by side, and for this\r\ncharged it only 8 cents a barrel. The public, shipping either by the\r\nrailroad or by the pipe line, had to pay 52 cents a barrel for 500\r\nmiles; but by this arrangement between themselves the two carriers\r\nwould do business at 8 cents a barrel for 280 miles, at which rate the\r\ncharge to the public to the seaboard should have been not quite 15\r\ncents instead of 52 cents.\r\n\r\nThe statement was also made that the oil combination, instead of\r\ngiving the railroads the business it has guaranteed them, makes its\r\nobligation good by turning over to them periodically a check for the\r\nprofits they would have had on hauling that amount of traffic. As the\r\nguarantee was made as a consideration for the maintenance of high\r\nfreight rates, such a payment by it would amount, in cold fact, to\r\npaying those in charge of the highways a large bribe to deny the use of\r\nthem to the people.\r\n\r\nThis declaration of the provisions of the bargain was made by the\r\ncounsel for the refiners seeking relief from the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission. In his argument demanding the production of the document\r\nhe said: \"I have had it in my hand and read every word of it, and know\r\nexactly what it contains.\"[216]\r\n\r\nThe sharpest legal struggle of the case was made on the demand that\r\nthis paper be produced. The Commission decided that it was \"wholly\r\nimmaterial,\" although the chairman had previously said: \"It seems to us\r\nthat we cannot exclude this evidence.\" It was a document establishing\r\ninterstate rates, and these are required by law to be published, and\r\nthe Commission had always before this been liberal in compelling the\r\nproduction of papers which related to the making of rates.[217] The\r\nCommission had shortly before been threatened in this case by the\r\ncounsel for the Pennsylvania Railroad with extinction if it insisted\r\nupon evidence of the cost of piping oil which the oil combination\r\nrefused to give.\r\n\r\n\"It is possible that the powers of this Commission may be tested,\"[218]\r\nbullied the counsel of the railroad. The members of the Commission\r\nlaughed ostentatiously, but, for whatever reason, they gave the\r\npowerful corporations on trial no cause thereafter to \"test their\r\npowers,\" which have slept while justice tarried, and the victims of\r\nthis \"contract\" were kept under its harrow for three long years more,\r\nwhere they still lie.\r\n\r\nThe tax levied upon the consumers of oil by this agreement for high\r\nfreights amounts to millions a year. This agreement is at this writing\r\nstill in force. There is reason to believe that similar arrangements\r\nexist with the other trunk-lines. The result is the surprising fact\r\nthat \"oil rates are very much higher than they were twelve years ago,\r\nand when there was no pipe-line competition!\"[219] This is true also\r\nin the field of local pipeage--the transportation of the oil from the\r\nwells to refineries and railroads. Under the caption of \"cheapening\r\ntransportation\" the counsel of the oil trust said, before the New York\r\nLegislature in 1888: \"In 1872 the pipe-line system was in its infancy.\r\nA number of local lines existed. Their service was inefficient and\r\nexpensive. There was no uniform rate. The united refiners undertook to\r\nunite and systemize this business. They purchased and consolidated the\r\nvarious little companies into what was long known as the United Pipe\r\nLine System. The first effect of this combination was a reduction of\r\nprice of all local transportation to a uniform rate of at first 30, and\r\nsoon after 20 cents per barrel.\"[220]\r\n\r\n\"The united refiners\" and \"to unite and systemize\" are smooth phrases,\r\nfull of the unction of good-fellowship and political economy. When\r\nthe \"united refiners\" took possession of the pipe lines which had\r\nbeen forced into bankruptcy or \"co-operation,\" they did not reduce\r\nrates--they advanced them. \"The uniform rate of 20 cents,\" for\r\ninstance, is an advance of 300 per cent. on the rate of 5 cents made\r\nby the trust's pipe-line system during the war with the Tidewater,\r\nand over the similar rates made during the earlier pipe-line\r\ncompetition.[221] The nominal rate, Congress learned from one of the\r\noil-country men, was 30 cents for that service, but by competition the\r\nactual rate was down to 5 or 10 cents. \"They consolidated and placed it\r\nat 20 cents, and it has remained at 20 cents, I think, since the year\r\n1876.... The whole process of transportation has been cheapened. Pipe\r\nthat cost 45 cents a foot has in that time been got for 10 cents. The\r\nquality of the pipe was improved, so that there is not the leakage or\r\nthe wastage. There are all those improvements and inventions that have\r\ncheapened it. We pay the same now as we did fifteen years ago. We have\r\nreduced the cost of our wells at least 50 per cent. They have reduced\r\nnothing.\"[222] From other sources, once in a while, facts have come to\r\nlight showing how much less than cheap the local charge of 20 cents\r\na barrel is. For instance, it was shown before Congress that a line\r\nwhich, with its feeders, had fifty miles of pipe, and cost $70,000,\r\nmade a clear profit in its first six months of $40,000, charging\r\nsometimes less than this rate of 20 cents a barrel.[223]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to compute how much the defeat of legislation to\r\nregulate charges, or to allow the construction of competing lines, has\r\ncost the people. The Burdick Bill alone, to regulate prices of pipeage\r\nand storage in Pennsylvania, it was calculated by conservative men,\r\nwould have saved at least $4,000,000 a year. The killing of it was in\r\nthe interest of keeping up the high prices of the pipe lines, which\r\nfinally rest in the price of oil.\r\n\r\nWhen the combination got possession of the pipe line to Buffalo, which\r\nothers had built in spite of every obstacle it could interpose, it\r\nraised the rates of pipeage to 25 cents a barrel from 10 cents,[224]\r\nand as happened in Pennsylvania in 1885, the railroads to Buffalo in\r\n1882 raised their rates simultaneously with the pipe line. Pittsburg\r\nhad the same experience. When its independent pipe line was \"united\r\nand systemized\" by being torn up and converted into \"old iron,\" as the\r\nVice-President of the Pennsylvania Railroad had told its projectors\r\nit would be, the rates of transportation for oil went up.[225] The\r\nsame thing happened at Cleveland. At the rate at which the Lake Shore\r\nroad carries oil from Cleveland to Chicago--357 miles for 38 cents a\r\nbarrel--it should charge less than 15 cents for the 140 miles between\r\nOil City and Cleveland; but as late as 1888 it charged 25 cents.\r\nWhy? The effect of the railroad charge is that little oil comes by\r\nrail to Cleveland from the oil regions; it goes by the pipe line of\r\nthose whom the Lake Shore has been \"protecting\" ever since the South\r\nImprovement contract of 1872. There have been 3,000,000 barrels of\r\nthis business yearly. The railroad officials exercise their powers to\r\ndrive traffic from the railroad to a competing line. Why? We can see\r\nwhy the combination, which, by the possession of this pipe line, is a\r\ncompetitor of the Lake Shore, should desire such an arrangement; but\r\nit exists by the act of the Lake Shore Railroad. Why? The theories of\r\nself-interest would lead one to expect that the stockholders of the\r\nroad would find out why.[226]\r\n\r\nThe pipe lines are the largest single item in the property of the oil\r\ncombination. Here its control has been the most complete; and here the\r\nreduction of price has been least. This is a telltale fact, soon told\r\nand soon understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSONG OF THE BARREL\r\n\r\n\r\nGenius could take so unspeakable a thing as a shirt and sing it\r\ninto an immortal song, but a barrel--and an oil-barrel, greasy and\r\nill-smelling--even genius could do nothing with that. But the barrel\r\nplays a leading rôle in the drama of the great monopoly. Out of it\r\nhave flown shapes of evil that have infected private fortunes, the\r\nprosperity of more than one industry, the fiduciary honor of great\r\nmen, the faithfulness of the Government to its citizens. Perhaps\r\na part of what genius could do for the shirt--force a hearing for\r\nthe wronged--may be done for this homely vessel of the struggling\r\nindependent by the kindly solicitude of the people to learn every\r\nsecret spring of the ruin of their brothers.\r\n\r\nThe market--the barrel that went to market--the freight rate that\r\nstopped the barrel that went to market--the railway king who made the\r\nrate that stopped the barrel that went to market--the greater king who\r\nwhispered behind to the railway king to make the rate that stopped the\r\nbarrel that went to market--this is the house that Jack unbuilt.\r\n\r\nSuch is the superiority of a simple business organization, where\r\n\"evolution\" has not carried the details of the industry out of sight\r\nof the owner, and where the master and man, buyer and seller, are in\r\ntouch, that the independent refiners could overcome the tax imposed\r\non them by this pooling of the pipe line and the railroads, and not\r\nonly survive but prosper moderately. During the three years--from\r\n1885 to 1888--following the first attack upon them under the contract\r\njust described, they state, in their appeal to the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission in 1888, they were \"enabled by their advantages\r\nin the local markets to keep up, maintain, and even increase their\r\nbusiness.\"[227] These \"outsiders\" shipped their oil largely in barrels\r\nbecause the trunk-lines had made it as nearly impossible as they\r\ncould for them to ship in tank-cars. They, like all in the trade,\r\ncould not live without access to the European market. Out of every\r\nhundred barrels of various kinds of products from the distillation\r\nof petroleum, forty are of an illuminating oil not good enough to be\r\nburned in this country. It must be sold in Europe or not sold at all;\r\nand a manufacturer who cannot get rid of 40 per cent. of his product\r\nmust give up manufacturing. To destroy the barrel method of shipment\r\nwould destroy those who could use no other; and to close their outlet\r\nto Europe would make it impossible for them to continue to manufacture\r\nfor the home supply. The barrel was the only life-raft left to the\r\nsinking independent.\r\n\r\nThey who had planned the secret pool of 1885 between the pipe line\r\nand the railroads, and the further advance of rates by both in 1888,\r\nnow called upon the railroads to deliver a final stroke against the\r\nindependents.[228] The railroads, when directed in previous years to\r\nsay \"no\" to applications for transportation, and \"no\" to those who\r\nwanted the right to put their own tank-cars on the road, had obeyed;\r\nthey obeyed again.\r\n\r\nA pretext for the suppression of the barrel was easily found. It was\r\na poor one, but poor pretexts are better than none. When the future\r\n\"trustees\" of the \"light of the world\" were doing a small fraction\r\nof the business, they got the contract of 1872 from the railroads to\r\n\"overcome\" all their competitors, on the pretext of \"increasing the\r\ntrade.\"[229] When by this contract and those that followed it they had\r\nsecured nine-tenths of the trade, they got the railroads to say \"no\"\r\nto the remaining one-tenth, on the pretext that they could not ship as\r\nmuch.[230] When the Interstate Commerce law declared it to be a crime\r\nfor railroads to forbid persons the road because they could not ship as\r\nmuch as others, the combination had the railroads shut out its rivals,\r\non the pretext that they did not use tank-cars,[231] although tank-cars\r\n\"are worse than powder.\" When regular tank-cars were offered by its\r\ncompetitors for shipment--as to the Pacific coast--the combination\r\nintroduced an inferior tank-car, of which it claimed, without warrant,\r\nas the courts afterwards held, that it owned the patent, and so\r\nobtained the sole right of way across the continent, on the pretext\r\nthat other shippers did not use this poor car.[232]\r\n\r\nThe pretext now used against the refiners of Pennsylvania was the\r\npassing phrase, \"He must pay freight on barrels,\" in a decision of\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission concerning Southern traffic. This\r\ndecision had no relevancy to the oil business of the North. Six months\r\nwent by after it was given with no intimation from any one that it\r\nrelated in any way to the situation in Pennsylvania, and to be so\r\napplied it had to be turned inside out and upside down. In the Rice\r\ncase the Commission had decided that freight rates must be reduced on\r\nbarrel shipments. This was, in the sharp language of the decision, to\r\nput an end to \"the most unjust and injurious discrimination against\r\nbarrel shippers in favor of tank shippers,\" a discrimination which the\r\nCommission has elsewhere said \"inured mostly to the benefit of one\r\npowerful combination.\"\r\n\r\nIn ordering this reduction it said: \"Even then the shipper in barrels\r\nis at some disadvantage, for he must pay freight on barrels as well as\r\non oil.\"\r\n\r\nBy \"must pay\" the Commission meant \"was paying.\" It was, as it\r\nafterwards protested, \"rather a statement of a prevailing practice\r\nthan a ruling.\"[233] And the remark furthermore concerned the trade in\r\nthe South and Southwest alone, where special circumstances existed not\r\nfound at the North.\r\n\r\nSix months after this decision the Pennsylvania and other Northern\r\nroads made these words, \"He must pay freight on the barrels,\" the\r\noccasion of an increase of rates, which stopped the refineries of\r\nthe independents. They were carrying free the heavy tanks--\"the\r\nmost undesirable business we do,\" in the language of their freight\r\nagent. They had been carrying the barrels of the independents free\r\nfor twenty years. Now, continuing to carry the tank-cars free, they\r\nlevied a prohibitory transportation tax on the barrels. To cap it all,\r\nthey declared, in announcing the new rule, that it had been forced\r\nupon them by the Interstate Commerce Commission. But the President\r\nof the Pennsylvania Railroad is found admitting that it was the oil\r\ncombination that dictated the move--\"the seaboard refiners insisted.\"\r\n\"Upon your decision\" (in the Rice case) \"being promulgated,\" he wrote\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission, \"the seaboard refiners insisted\r\nthat we were bound to charge for packages,\" barrels, not tanks, \"as\r\nwell as for the oil.\"[234]\r\n\r\nThe seaboard refiners were the members of the oil trust; the others\r\nat the seaboard had been wiped out years before by the help of the\r\nrailroads. Though the Pennsylvania Railroad was not a party to the case\r\nbefore the Commission, though it had not been called upon to change\r\nits practice, which was what it ought to be, it did now change it from\r\nright to wrong. The Commission had ordered that discrimination between\r\nthe barrel and the tank should cease. The Pennsylvania, which had not,\r\nstrange to say, been practising that forbidden kind of discrimination,\r\nimmediately resorted to it, and, stranger still, gave as its reason the\r\norder of the Commission against it. It must have been a keen eye that\r\ncould find in a \"qualified and incidental remark,\" as the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission styles it, in such a decision, a command to charge\r\nfor the weight of the barrels and increase freight rates; but such\r\nan eye there was--an eye that will never sleep as long as Naboth's\r\nvineyard belongs to Naboth.\r\n\r\nAll the trunk-line railroads to the East took part in the new\r\nregulation--September 3, 1888--that freight must be paid thereafter\r\non the weight of the barrels as well as on the oil itself, and at the\r\nsame rate. This increased the cost of transportation to New York to\r\n66 cents from 52 cents, and to other points proportionately. Freight\r\nrates on the oil of \"the seaboard refiners\" who shipped in tanks were\r\nleft untouched. In the circulars announcing the change it was said to\r\nbe done \"in accordance with the directions of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission.\"[235] When the refiners whom this advance threatened\r\nwith ruin wrote to expostulate, they got the same reply from all the\r\nrailroad officials as from President Roberts of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad: \"The advance in rates ... has been forced upon us by the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission.\"[236]\r\n\r\nThe Commission immediately called the responsible official of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, which was the leader in this move, \"to a\r\npersonal interview,\" \"expressed their surprise,\" and suggested the\r\nwithdrawal of the circular and of the increased rates. This was in\r\nAugust.[237] No attention was paid to this by the road. The Commission\r\nwaited until October 10th, and then sent a formal communication to\r\nthe President of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which was followed by\r\ncorrespondence and personal conferences with him. The Commission\r\npointed out that the statement of the circular was \"misleading,\" \"not\r\ntrue,\" \"decidedly objectionable\"; that the Commission had made no\r\ndecision with reference to the rates of the Pennsylvania Railroad or\r\nthe other Eastern lines; that its decision, applicable solely to the\r\nroads of the South or Southwest, had been that rates on barrels must\r\nbe reduced, and that it was not right to use this as an excuse for\r\nincreasing the rates on barrels. Finally, the Commission said that\r\nif it had made any ruling applicable to the Pennsylvania Railroad it\r\nwould have been compelled to hold that its practice, of twenty years'\r\nstanding, of carrying the barrels free, since it carried tanks free,\r\nwas \"just and proper,\" and that there was nothing to show that an\r\nadvance in its rates was called for.[238]\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission was the body specially created by\r\nCongress to interpret the Interstate Commerce Law. The Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad was one of the common carriers under the orders of the\r\nCommission, and its managers were subjects of jurisdiction, not judges.\r\nBut its method of running the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, as if it\r\nwere one of its limited trains, was now applied with equal confidence\r\nto the Interstate Commerce Commission. It insisted that it was itself,\r\nnot the Commission, which was the judge of what the latter meant by\r\nits own decisions. The road continued the rates against which the\r\nCommission protested. The Commission demanded that the assertions that\r\nthe new rule of charging for the barrels and the advance of rates was\r\nmade \"in accordance with the directions\" of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission be withdrawn. The Pennsylvania road responded with another\r\ncircular, in which it changed the form but repeated the substance. \"The\r\naction referred to was taken for the purpose of conforming the practice\r\nof this company to the principles decided by the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission.\" The Commission protested that it was not laying down any\r\nsuch \"principles\" but the corporation declared that that was what it\r\n\"understood,\" and held to the advance made on that understanding.[239]\r\n\r\nTo the almost weeping expostulations of the Commission in interviews\r\nand letters, to show that it had said nothing which could justify the\r\naction of the roads, the officials made not the slightest concession.\r\n\"I did not consider it in that way,\" said one of them.[240] \"That\r\nwas their (the Commission's) view of the case, but it was not shared\r\nby us,\" said the President of the Pennsylvania Railroad. \"It was\r\nconsidered best to continue the practice,\" he said.[241]\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not rescind the order?\" he was asked before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission.\r\n\r\n\"We understood their ruling to be a ruling for the whole country,\" he\r\nincorrigibly replied.\r\n\r\nThe railway president studiously withheld any assurance that he would\r\nobey if the Commission issued a direct command, which it had not done,\r\nthough it had the authority.\r\n\r\n\"We would then take the subject up,\" he said.\r\n\r\nChange the order to comply with the ruling of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission the roads would not and did not.[242]\r\n\r\nAll the roads to the seaboard and New England had made the order in\r\nconcert, and together they maintained it. It was one hand, evidently,\r\nthat moved them all, and though that hand moved them, for the benefit\r\nof a carrier rival of theirs--the pipe line of the trust--against their\r\nown customers, against their own employers, against the authority of\r\nthe United States Government, all these railroad presidents and freight\r\nagents obeyed it with the docility of domestic animals.\r\n\r\nThese officials were the loyal subjects of a higher power than that of\r\nthe United States, higher even than that of their railway corporations.\r\nThey serve the greatest sovereign of the modern world--the concentrated\r\nwealth, in whose court the presidents of railways and republics, kings,\r\nparliaments, and congresses are but lords in waiting.\r\n\r\nThanks to the superior enterprise of their greater need, the\r\nindependents of Oil City and Titusville had been able to survive the\r\nblows that had preceded, but this was too much. They had weathered\r\nthe surrender in 1883 of the Tidewater Pipe Line, which had promised\r\nthem freedom forever. Even the \"contract\" which made the allied pipe\r\nlines and the railroads in 1885 one, to tax them half as much again\r\nfor transportation, had not broken them down. In spite of it they had\r\nbeen able \"to maintain and increase their business.\"[243] But now they\r\nclosed their works. The new attack had been shrewdly timed to spoil\r\nfor them in that year--1888--the season of greatest activity in the\r\nexport to Europe and Asia. They appealed to the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission. \"The greater proportion of our refineries are idle.\"[244]\r\n\"I have not a customer in the entire New England States. I have not had\r\nsince the advance of last September.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was it before the advance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a number of customers.\"[245]\r\n\r\nLabor, though, as always, the most silent, suffered the most. Three\r\nhundred coopers were thrown out of work in Titusville alone within a\r\nshort time, and the loss of employment to the workmen in the refineries\r\nwas still more serious. This was not because trade was bad. Exports\r\nwere never greater than in 1889. Government statistics reveal as in a\r\nmirror what was being done.\r\n\r\nThe exports of refined petroleum increased 21 per cent. in 1889 over\r\n1888. But Perth Amboy, from which the independents shipped for the\r\nmost part, showed a decrease of over 18-1/2 per cent. By the stroke of\r\na freight agent's pen the business of these men was being taken from\r\nthem, to be given to others. The general tide was rising, but their\r\nfeet were sinking in a quicksand.\r\n\r\nThe export business of Boston in oil was given to the \"seaboard\r\nrefiners\" by the same stroke. Freights that had been $100 were now $174\r\nto Boston, and $188 to New York. These rates were so high as to stop\r\noil from going through. \"The Nova Scotia trade,\" it was testified,\r\n\"goes to New York, and from there by water, whereas they used to buy\r\nin Boston. Boston brokers will ship oil from New York and get it to\r\nNova Scotia cheaper than if it went from Boston, whereas when we had\r\nthe export rate we could compete in that market.\"[246] Two months\r\nlater most of what remained of the business of the independents in\r\nNew England was added to the gift of their foreign trade, which had\r\nalready been made to the \"seaboard refiners.\" By an order of October\r\n25, 1888, the railroads made it known to these \"pestilences,\" as the\r\nlawyers of the railroads called the independent refiners in court,[247]\r\nthat they would not be allowed to send any more through shipments into\r\nNew England. This was done, as in Ohio in 1879,[248] without the notice\r\nrequired by law, though in the meantime a Federal law had been passed\r\nrequiring notice.[249]\r\n\r\nThis order was the finishing touch in the task of using the freight\r\ntariff to prevent freight shipment. It shut the independents--the\r\nhunted shippers--out of over 150 towns in New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\nMaine, Massachusetts, including Manchester, Burlington, Portland,\r\nSalem, in which they had built up a good business, and it made\r\nit impossible to reach these places except by paying high local\r\nrates--from station to station--which were not required of their\r\ncompetitor, who shipped on through rates. The railroads would take the\r\noil of the independents for shipment, but would not tell them what the\r\nrates would be. In this, as in all the moves of this game, we see the\r\nrailroad managers of a score of different roads, at points thousands\r\nof miles apart, taking the same step at the same time, like a hundred\r\nelectric clocks ticking all over a great city to the tune of the clock\r\nat headquarters that makes and breaks their circuit.\r\n\r\nThe independents were saved by a Canadian railroad from the destruction\r\nwhich American railroads had planned for them. The Grand Trunk gave\r\nthem a rate by which they could still do some business in the upper\r\npart of New England, though to do this they had to ship the oil into\r\nCanada and back into the United States. The effect of this abolition of\r\nthrough rates in \"cheapening\" oil was that the people of Vermont, for\r\ninstance, had to pay 2 cents a gallon more than any other place in New\r\nEngland.[250]\r\n\r\nWhile all access for others to New England was cut off, the \"seaboard\r\nrefiners,\" sending the oil in free tanks to the seaboard, transshipping\r\nit there into vessels by the facilities of \"which they have a\r\nmonopoly,\"[251] easily made their own the business of their rivals in\r\nthe 150 towns from which the latter were thus cut off. No one has been\r\nable to move all the railroads in this way, as one interlocking switch,\r\nto obey a law or accommodate the public. But it was done easily enough\r\nfor this kind of work. Possession was got of the railway managers at\r\nthe initial points, as was done so successfully in another case,[252]\r\nand all the other railway managers, as far as Boston, followed in their\r\ntrail. Reproducing the tactics in Ohio in 1879, it was only against oil\r\nthat this attack of the tariff was made. Other freight for export, of\r\nwhich there was a vast variety, continued to be carried to Boston at\r\nthe same rate as before.[253]\r\n\r\nAll the freight agent of the initial road had to do with the oil on its\r\nway to Europe was to pass it along to the next line. Whether, after\r\nleaving his road, it went by the way of Boston or that of New York made\r\nno difference to his road, and was in no way his affair. But it made a\r\ngreat deal of difference to those who wanted all the business of Europe\r\nand America for themselves, and we consequently find him serving them,\r\nand dis-serving his employer (the railroad), by charging 21 cents a\r\nbarrel if the oil was going to Boston after leaving his line, but only\r\n15-56/100 cents if it was going to New York. When asked if he thought\r\nhe was justified as a railroad man under the law in making the charges\r\nfor what he did vary according to what was done by the business after\r\nit left his hands, he refused to answer.\r\n\r\n\"You will not answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at present.\"[254]\r\n\r\nAll the connecting and following roads are on record as having\r\nprotested against the measures in which they followed the lead of\r\nthe initial lines.[255] The freight agent of the West Shore Railroad\r\ndeclared that the prohibition of through shipments to the towns of\r\nMassachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine \"occurred simply\r\nthrough mistake;\" but the mistake, he acknowledged, had never been\r\ncorrected.[256] This \"mistake\" and that of September, which preceded\r\nit, put an end to a large business, amounting in 1888 to 900,000\r\nbarrels. The men, whom the railroads began to massacre after having\r\npledged them full protection, saved a fraction of their trade in\r\nNew England, as we have seen, only by taking refuge with a foreign\r\nrailroad. The railroads against their will, as they swore, lost\r\nbusiness as well as honor, but the mistake was not corrected.\r\n\r\nIt would tax the imagination of a Cervantes to dream out a more\r\nfantastic tangle of sense and nonsense in quixotic combat than that\r\nwhich these highwaymen spun out of the principles of \"scientific\r\nrailroading.\" All that highway control could do to destroy the barrel\r\nshippers for the benefit of the tank shippers was done; and yet the\r\nbarrel method is the safer and more profitable for the railroads.[257]\r\nThe cars that carry oil in barrels can return loaded; the railroads\r\nhave to haul the tank-cars back empty and pay mileage on them.[258] For\r\na series of years on the Pennsylvania Railroad the damage from carrying\r\noil in barrels was less than half the damage from the carrying of oil\r\nin tanks.[259] The general freight agent of the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nCompany tells the Interstate Commerce Commission that the carriage of\r\noil in tank-cars \"is the most undesirable business we do.\" He described\r\na smash-up at New Brunswick where there was a collision with a line of\r\ntank-cars. The oil got on fire; it ran two squares, got into a sewer,\r\noverflowed the canal, which was then frozen over, and followed the ice\r\na square or two beyond. Besides having to pay nearly five hundred\r\nthousand dollars damages for the destruction done, the railroad lost\r\nits bridge, which cost two or three hundred thousand dollars. It lost\r\nmore money than it could make carrying oil for ten years. \"I regard\r\nit,\" he said, \"as worse than powder to carry; I would rather carry\r\nanything else than oil in tanks.\"[260] Barrel shipments being the best\r\nfor the railroads, these princes of topsy-turvydom move heaven and\r\nearth to destroy them.[261]\r\n\r\nThere was no end to the \"mistakes\" made by the railroads for the\r\n\"self-renunciation\" of their business, though this was in favor of\r\nthose whose pipe line made them rivals. They charged more for kerosene\r\nin barrels than for other articles of more value, contradicting\r\ntheir own rule of charging what the traffic will bear. They let the\r\ncombination carry sixty-two gallons in every tank free on the theory\r\nof leakage in transportation. \"The practice,\" said the Commission, \"is\r\nso obvious and palpable a discrimination that no discussion of it is\r\nnecessary;\" and they ordered it discontinued.[262]\r\n\r\nThough the railroads brought back the tanks free, for the return of\r\nthe empty barrels they never forgot to charge. This charge was made so\r\nhigh that at one time it prohibited the return from all points.[263]\r\n\"The monopoly uses a large number of barrels in New York City,\" the\r\nindependents said to the Commission; \"it is to its interest that empty\r\nsecond-hand barrels should not be returned to the inland refiner.\" When\r\nthis was brought out the Pennsylvania and other railroads promised to\r\nmake reparation, but had not done so years later when the case was\r\nstill \"hung up\" in the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\n\r\nIt was not lack of capital or of diligence that made the independents\r\nuse barrels instead of tanks; tanks were useless to them. All the\r\noil terminal facilities of the railroads at the seaboard had been\r\nsurrendered to the combination for its exclusive use.[264] These were\r\nthe only places where tank-cars could be unloaded into steamers. \"There\r\nare no facilities to which we, as outside refiners, have access to load\r\nbulk oil into vessels,\" and none where these refiners could send oil in\r\ntank-cars to be barrelled for shipment abroad.[265] No matter how many\r\ntank-cars and tank-vessels the independents might have provided, they\r\ncould not have got them together. Between the two were the docks in the\r\nunrelenting grip which held solely for its private use the shipping\r\nfacilities of these public carriers. Not even oil in barrels could the\r\nindependents get through these oil docks.\r\n\r\nThe Weehawken oil docks of the Erie road on New York harbor are the\r\nbest in the world. The Erie Railroad has $920,760 invested in them, but\r\nonly one shipper can use them either for tanks or barrels.\r\n\r\nThe Western traffic manager of the Erie was asked:\r\n\r\n\"Would you take a shipment there over the Erie road of independent oil\r\nconsigned to the New York docks?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"[266]\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad refuses to haul tank-cars for the\r\nindependents to any other point at New York than the terminals so\r\ncontrolled by the combination. It will not haul them to other docks of\r\nits own. It will not let oil be shipped over its line to the points\r\nat which it connects with other roads for other harbors, though it\r\nwill take shipments of anything else than oil.[267] This amounts to a\r\nrefusal to allow the independents to use tank-cars or tank-steamers.\r\nPractically the same policy is pursued by all the main trunk-lines.\r\nThese independents could get rid of their export oil only by selling\r\nto the combination. Through its other self--the company which controls\r\nthe terminals--it has kept an agent in the oil regions for years to\r\nbuy for export this refined oil which its owners and makers could not\r\nexport themselves. This is the \"immediate shipment\" of 1878 in another\r\nphase.[268]\r\n\r\n\"You have to sell to the Standard Oil Company in order to get your oil\r\nshipped in bulk from Communipaw?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"The independent cannot get his oil into a bulk vessel at Communipaw?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"[269]\r\n\r\nTo meet these disclosures the Pennsylvania presented two affidavits.\r\nOne was from its general freight agent that its tank-cars were offered\r\nfreely to all; but it did not deny, for it could not deny, any of\r\nthese facts about terminals, which explained why the flies did not\r\nwalk into its parlor. The other affidavit was from the secretary of\r\nthe corporation controlling the terminals for the oil combination, and\r\nit similarly declared that its accommodations were furnished \"upon\r\nexactly the same terms to all.\" How long it had been doing so, or how\r\nlong it would continue to do so, it did not state, as the independents\r\npointed out to the Commission. If this were the truth instead of\r\nbeing, as the independents hinted, \"evidently a situation that has\r\nbeen recently arranged for the purposes of this application\"--to the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission for further delay--why had none of the\r\nindependents, dying for want of export facilities, resorted to it? This\r\nwas not explained, for it could not be. The independents explained the\r\nsituation to the Interstate Commerce Commission: \"The inland refiner\r\nwho intrusts his oil to a storage company at the seaboard with a view\r\nto exporting, puts himself completely into the power of such concern.\r\nThe exactions that may be unfairly imposed in individual cases for\r\n'loss by leakage,' 'dumping and mixing for off-color or off-test,'\r\n'cost of water white oil for mixing,' 'tares,' 'tares guarantee,'\r\n'commissions on sales,' 'interest on goods until loaded and paid for,'\r\n'incidental expenses,' and many other known matters of charge, may\r\namount to a partial confiscation of the cargo.\"\r\n\r\nThe corporation which manages this monopoly of the terminals at\r\nCommunipaw is a mysterious concern. Who own its stock, and what its\r\nrelations with the railroad are, the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\ncould not find out. Its president and treasurer were summoned to\r\ntestify, but refused to attend. The manager of the oil combination's\r\npipe lines stated that he knew of stock in the company that was owned\r\nby a member of the trust, though he afterwards qualified that he\r\ndid not know it \"positively.\"[270] The charge that this company was\r\ncontrolled by the monopoly was specifically made before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission and was not denied, and the Commission found\r\nthat the oil combination \"have a monopoly of those facilities to the\r\nexclusion of complainants.\"[271] It thus reported the same state of\r\nfacts in 1892 as the New York Legislature in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe barrel was therefore the fountain of life for the independent.\r\nWithout barrels he could not get his oil on board ship for export, and\r\nwithout exporting he could not live and refine for the home market.\r\nThe oil combination ships in barrels also. According to the figures\r\ngiven in this case by one of its \"assistant managers\" its shipments by\r\nbarrel are very large. This testimony was introduced to make it appear\r\ncruel to insinuate that the difference between barrels and tanks was\r\nmade by the railroads to favor it, since it as well as the independents\r\nused barrels. The Commission openly expressed its dissatisfaction with\r\nthis evidence, and dismissed the subject by the conclusive observation\r\nthat the combination gains more by the low tank-car rates than it\r\nloses by the high barrel rates.[272] For the independent, however, the\r\ndifference in rates was almost all loss, for he at that time shipped\r\nmostly in barrels. The high prices it made for oil and for freights at\r\nTitusville and Oil City did not hurt the combination. It had only to\r\nclose its refineries there and transfer their business for the time to\r\nits establishments elsewhere. This it did, keeping some of them idle\r\nfor years.[273]\r\n\r\nSuch was the story told to the Interstate Commerce Commission, in many\r\nhundred pages of testimony, by the refiners of Oil City and Titusville,\r\nwho appealed to it for the justice \"without expense, without delay, and\r\nwithout litigation\" promised the people when the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission was created.[274] The game, of which you have perhaps\r\nbeen able to get a dim idea from the printed page, the Commissioners\r\nsaw played before them like chess with living figures. For years\r\nthe principal subject of their official investigations had been the\r\nmanoeuvres of the oil ring. They had been compelled by the law and\r\nthe facts to condemn its relation with the railroads in language of\r\nstinging severity, as every court has done before which it has been\r\nbrought. Better than any other men in the country, except the men in\r\nthe ring, the Commissioners knew what was being done. They comprehended\r\nperfectly who the \"seaboard refiners\" were whose demand that their\r\ncompetitors should be shut out of Europe and New England was better law\r\nwith the Pennsylvania Railroad than the decisions of the Commission.\r\nThey needed no enlightenment as to the purpose of the secret contract\r\nbetween the members of the oil trust and the Pennsylvania, nor any\r\ninstruction that the \"pool\" between the pipe line and the railroad was\r\nas hostile to the public interest as any pool between common carriers.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the Commission had openly hinted that the relations of\r\nthe oil trust and the railroads were collusive, and that the spring\r\nfrom which they flowed was a secret contract.[275] It was shown to the\r\nCommission that at the same time the railroads advanced their rates the\r\noil combination bid up the price of the raw material of the Titusville\r\nand Oil City refineries. This is called \"advancing the premium.\"[276]\r\nThe raise of the freight rate added 14 cents a barrel to the cost of\r\nproduction, and the increased price of oil put on 12 cents more, either\r\nitem large enough to embarrass competition. The Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission in its decision recognized the practical simultaneity of\r\nthe three movements to the disadvantage of the independent refiners:\r\n(1) the bidding up of the price of crude oil against them; (2) the new\r\nrule of charging for the weight of the barrel; and (3) the abrogation\r\nof the through rates to New England. These three things occurred in a\r\nperiod of about two months. This, the Commission says, lends color to\r\nthe charge that there was concert of action between the combination and\r\nthe railroad.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners in their sittings had seen that the counsel for the\r\nrailroads did not pretend to bring forward any evidence to prove that\r\ntheir attack on the barrel shippers was just or proper. Although \"the\r\nseaboard refiners,\" for whose pecuniary profit these things had been\r\ndone, were not on trial, their witnesses, agents, and attorneys were\r\nin constant attendance, and kept close watch of the testimony and\r\narguments. The Commission had its attention called specifically to the\r\nfact that the defence of the railroads on trial was being directed by\r\nthe same \"seaboard refiners\" who had \"insisted\" that the railroads\r\nshould violate the law. The counsel for the Erie road was frank\r\nenough to admit that it was they who had prompted that carrier in its\r\nlitigation before the Commission. When the Erie appeared before the\r\nCommission to give \"further testimony,\" its representative could not\r\ntell at whose request its application therefor had been made, and said\r\nhe had known nothing about the matter until the day before. Three of\r\nthe six witnesses then examined were from the offices of the oil trust,\r\nwhose members had refused to come when summoned. The only subpoenas\r\nthey obey are those issued from their own headquarters.\r\n\r\nThe president of the oil combination's pipe lines--who is also\r\nthe president of the steamship line in which its members are\r\ninterested--and the vice-president of the pipe lines, and the president\r\nand the treasurer of the company which holds for the trust the monopoly\r\nof the terminal facilities, and the President of the New York, Lake\r\nErie, and Western Railroad, and its vice-president, were all served\r\nwith official notice to come and testify. But these gentlemen refused\r\nto appear. \"It is for your honors,\" said the counsel for the refiners,\r\nsuggestively, \"to determine what obedience shall be paid to your\r\nsubpoenas.\"[277] But the Commission did nothing.\r\n\r\nThe defendant corporations, and their lawyers, officers, and witnesses,\r\nmade no pretence of treating the Interstate Commerce Commission with\r\nanything more than a physical respect. The representatives of the\r\nrailroad companies practically told the Commission that its decisions\r\nwere subordinate to theirs, and that they knew better than it what\r\nits rulings meant. Witnesses refused to answer questions they found\r\nawkward, and the lawyers gave the court to understand that if it did\r\nwhat they did not like they would snuff it out. The Commission heard\r\none of the refiners who was a petitioner before it assailed with\r\ncoarse vituperation, described in open court as a \"pestilence,\"[278]\r\nbecause he had dared to write more than once to the railroads for the\r\nreduction of rates which would save him from destruction, and which the\r\nCommission had, not once, but half a dozen times, said the railroads\r\nought to give to all.\r\n\r\nThe Commission had itself, outrunning the complainants, been the first\r\nto \"pointedly disapprove\" the attempt to destroy the barrel shippers,\r\nand to call upon the railroads to rescind their action. This protest\r\nit had made repeatedly--first with the subalterns, then with the chief\r\nof the Pennsylvania Railroad, in personal interviews, letters, and\r\nfinally in an official pamphlet, which was an appeal to the public to\r\njudge between it and the corporation. It had reiterated its protest\r\nin a formal decision rendered September 5, 1890, after deliberating\r\nseven months on the evidence and arguments. In this \"they recalled\r\nthe fact, now almost ancient history, that\" the change was \"pointedly\r\ndisapproved by the Commission\" when first made, and with lamentations\r\nnoted that, though almost two years had passed, \"the carriers have\r\nfailed to comply with the suggestions there made. In charging for\r\nthe weight of the barrels as well as the oil, the carriers that make\r\nuse of both modes of transportation have disregarded the principles\r\nplainly and emphatically laid down by the Commission in the cases\r\ncited, and have paid no attention to the subsequent official memorandum\r\nexplanatory of the decisions in those cases, but have persisted\r\nin maintaining a discrimination against barrel shippers. An order\r\nrequiring the discontinuance of the discrimination has therefore become\r\nnecessary.\"[279]\r\n\r\nAn order has therefore become necessary. The Commission then ordered\r\none road concerned in this separate case to \"cease and desist\" within\r\nthirty days. Although several cases affecting a number of refiners and\r\na number of roads had been heard and submitted together, as practically\r\none in traffic, territory, circumstances, and the main question, it\r\nconfined its decision to the case which involved only one road, and\r\nthat a subordinate. There the Commission stopped; and there it stuck\r\nfor more than two years, from September 5, 1890, to November 14, 1892,\r\nrefraining from a decision in the case of the principal offender, the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad is the representative carrier in the oil\r\ntraffic. It controls all the oil business that passes over its lines,\r\nno matter how far away it originates. The initial road which led\r\nthe attack on the barrel shippers is subsidiary to the Pennsylvania\r\nin the oil business, and the Pennsylvania controls its rates and\r\nregulations.[280] The Pennsylvania has been the head and front of the\r\nrailroad attack on these men, and has been the open nullifier of the\r\nlaw and the Commission in this matter. It was the principal defendant\r\non trial, and its case was identical with that of the others, except\r\nthat it was the most flagrant; but no order would the Commission issue\r\nagainst it for two years. Wendell Phillips says: \"There is no power\r\nin one State to resist such a giant as the Pennsylvania road. We have\r\nthirty-eight one-horse legislatures in this country; and we have a man\r\nlike Tom Scott with three hundred and fifty millions in his hands, and\r\nif he walks through the States they have no power. Why, he need not\r\nmove at all; if he smokes, as Grant does, a puff of the waste smoke\r\nout of his mouth upsets the legislatures.\" When the Commission had\r\nordered a change of rates on barrels in the South, the Pennsylvania did\r\nthe Commission the double disrespect of declaring that that order was\r\nbinding upon itself against the protest of the Commission, and of using\r\nan order to reduce rates as an excuse for raising them. But now when\r\nthe Commission, September 5, 1890, made a decision on the same point in\r\na case arising in the territory and traffic in which the Pennsylvania\r\nwas the chief carrier--a case, too, of a bunch of cases in which the\r\nPennsylvania was a defendant--that road ignored it. The Commission,\r\nin the Rice, Robinson and Witherop case, in 1890, promulgated the\r\nvery rule which the Pennsylvania Railroad established, which it had\r\nbeen following for twenty years, and which its officers before the\r\nCommission swore was the correct one, but the Pennsylvania refused\r\nnow to accept and follow it. The road which was now ordered to go\r\nback to the correct practice, and which had perforce done so, was the\r\ninitial road. The Pennsylvania had followed its initiative in adopting\r\na \"false\" and \"misleading\" and \"unwarranted\" practice, but would not\r\nfollow it in changing to the good.\r\n\r\nThe attitude in which the Pennsylvania road and the Commission were\r\nthus placed towards each other was this: Shall the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad be allowed to make a charge which the Commission volunteered\r\nto rebuke it for making, and which it had decided, in the parallel\r\ncase of another road in the same situation, was altogether unwarranted\r\nand must cease? They stood thus facing each other more than two years.\r\nThere was apparently no excuse for delay the Commission would not\r\naccept. At one time it granted postponement on the plea of a lawyer\r\nthat his father was sick. More than the lawyer's father were sick; a\r\nwhole community of business men were sick; the entire country was sick,\r\nits industry, law, politics, morals--all. The administration of justice\r\nwas sick. If the facts had been uncertain, or the law undetermined,\r\nthe course of justice would still have seemed cruelly sluggish; but\r\nhere was a matter in which the facts and the law in question had been\r\nsettled, and by the Commission itself, over and over again. The only\r\nthing remaining was that the Pennsylvania Railroad, as well as the road\r\nwhich was its next neighbor, must obey the law. The railroad against\r\nwhich the Interstate Commerce Commission decided in 1890 on this point\r\njoined the Pennsylvania at Irvineton and Corry. The Commission put the\r\nlaw into force on one side of those points, but for two years gave\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad and others \"rehearings\" and other means of\r\ndelay, and did not open its lips to say that the same law must reign on\r\nthe other. The conduct of this corporation meant that it intended to\r\nrespect neither the Interstate Commerce Commission nor the Interstate\r\nCommerce law; that it recognized the will of cliqued wealth as the\r\nsupreme law; that the protestations of loyalty to the law and the\r\nCommission with which it accompanied its defiance of both were not\r\noffered as a disguise of respect, but were chosen as a method which\r\nwould most embarrass the people's tribunal in upholding itself and the\r\nrights of the citizens. All that was needed by those who had contrived\r\nand were continuing the wrong was time--they had everything else. Time\r\nthey got, and plenty of it.\r\n\r\nJuly 15, 1891, the refiners said to the Commission: \"Two and one-half\r\nyears have elapsed since these complaints were filed, and the end\r\nis not yet. We earnestly hoped that we had succeeded in convincing\r\nthis Commission that this respondent was inflicting on complainants a\r\ngreat and unnecessary wrong, which merited the most speedy remedy and\r\nredress possible. If we have failed in this we are unable to ascribe\r\nthe failure to a lack of evidence or promptness in presenting it.\r\nIt was not thought possible that all this great length of time would\r\nbe required to reach a conclusion in these matters, under all these\r\ncircumstances, especially after the decision in the Rice, Robinson,\r\nand Witherop case (September 5, 1890). The enemies of the complainants\r\ncould scarcely have found or wished for any more effectual way of\r\ninjuring complainants than by a long delay of their cause. Further\r\ndelay simply means further injury to complainants.\" The two years\r\nand a half have gone on to more than five years. A decision has been\r\nmade, but the end is not yet. The delay prevented the injured men from\r\ngoing to any other tribunal with their complaint. They have succeeded\r\nin keeping alive, though barely alive, because the price of their raw\r\nmaterial has declined a little, and given them a margin to cling to.\r\nThis delay has denied them justice in the special tribunal they were\r\ninvited to attend, and has also denied them the relief they could have\r\ngot from other courts.\r\n\r\nThe Commission heard all this urged by eloquent counsel. It heard the\r\nmen who were being crushed tell how their refineries were being closed,\r\ntheir customers lost, their business wrecked, their labor idle, while\r\nthe trade itself was growing larger than ever. It saw the statistics\r\nwhich proved it. But no practical relief have the independents of\r\nOil City and Titusville been able to get from it. They have lost the\r\nbusiness, lost the hopes of five years, lost the growth they would have\r\nmade, lost five years of life.\r\n\r\nThis delay of justice is awful, but it is not the end, for the\r\ndecision, though it came at last in November, 1892, has brought no\r\nhelp. It required the roads to either carry the barrels free or\r\nfurnish tank-cars to all shippers, and for the past ordered a refund\r\nof the freight charged on barrels to shippers who had been denied\r\nthe use of tank-cars. More than five months after it was rendered\r\nthe independents, in an appeal (April 20, 1893) to the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, called its attention to the fact that \"none of\r\nthe railroads in any one of the cases has as yet seen fit to obey\r\nany of its orders save such and to such extent as they found them\r\nadvantageous to themselves, although the time for doing so has\r\nexpired.\" More appalling still, it appeared, in an application made\r\nin March, 1893, by the Pennsylvania Railroad for a reopening of the\r\ncase, that these years of litigation were but preliminary to further\r\nlitigation. The counsel of the railroad, in the spirit in which it\r\nhad previously warned the Commission that its powers \"may be tested,\"\r\nnow informed it that the road, if the application for further delay\r\nwere not granted, would \"await proceedings in the Circuit Court for\r\nenforcement of what it believed to be an erroneous order.\" And in\r\nanother passage it referred to the proceedings before the Commission as\r\nbeing simply proceedings \"in advance of any final determination of the\r\ncase on its merits.\" Four years and a half had been consumed when, as\r\nthe independents pleaded to the Commission, \"it might reasonably have\r\nbeen expected that as many months would have sufficed,\" and yet these\r\nare only preliminary to \"the final determination of the case on its\r\nmerits.\"\r\n\r\n\"The delay suffered has been despairing--killing,\" was the agonized cry\r\nof the independents in their plea to the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nnot to grant this new delay. \"We pray that no more be permitted.\"\r\nBut in November, 1893, more delay was permitted by granting another\r\napplication of the Pennsylvania Railroad for \"rehearing.\" This was\r\nlimited to thirty days, but these have run into months, and \"the end is\r\nnot yet.\" Five years have now passed in this will-o'-the-wisp pursuit\r\nof justice \"without delay.\"\r\n\r\nAnd another \"outsider,\" who has been a suppliant since March,\r\n1889,[281] before the Interstate Commerce Commission for the same\r\nrelief--the free carriage of barrels where tanks are carried free--is\r\nstill a suppliant in vain. The Commission consumed three years in\r\nhearings and rehearings, only to report itself unable to decide this\r\nand other important points raised by him. It was \"a most perplexing\r\ninquiry,\" \"we are not prepared to hold,\" \"we desire to be made\r\nacquainted with the present situation,\" and \"the results exhibited\r\nby recent experience.\" \"No such intimation is intended,\" said the\r\nCommission, as that it is right for the roads to charge for barrels\r\nwhen they carried tanks free--not at all. \"We simply refrain\" from\r\nstopping the wrong, and \"reserve further opinion for fuller information\r\nand more satisfactory inquiry.\" Perhaps, however, by \"voluntary\r\naction\"[282] the railroads which had contrived this wrong would be\r\ngood enough to stop it, though the Commission was not good enough to\r\norder them to do so! The Commission held that the rates were \"unlawful;\r\nbut, for want of sufficient data, we do not undertake to point out\r\nthe particular modifications and reductions which would satisfy the\r\ndemands of justice.\"[283] \"We are not now prepared to determine,\" \"we\r\nfeel unable to prescribe,\" \"is not now decided,\" \"reopened for further\r\nevidence and argument,\" are the phrases with which the Commission\r\nglided away from the settlement of other vital points as to which its\r\nintervention had been invoked for more than three years. Even when it\r\ndirected the railroads to reduce their charge it added \"to what extent\r\nthe Commission does not now determine, and the cases will be held open\r\nfor such further,\" etc. And there his case hangs even unto this day,\r\nfor since this \"not-now-decided\" decision the \"outsider\" has never\r\nrenewed his appeals to the Interstate Commerce Commission concerning\r\nthese cases or others,[284] but, hopeless of redress, has let them go\r\nby default.\r\n\r\nThe secret contract stands, but the barrel men survive, barely, despite\r\nmonopoly, by changing to tank-cars, and getting a pipe-line and some\r\nterminals. They create seaboard facilities and persuade the Jersey\r\nCentral to haul their tanks. To meet this road they lay the pipe now to\r\nbe described, and, to escape railroads altogether, will build to New\r\nYork, if not ruined meanwhile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nUNFINISHED MARCH TO THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween May and December, Sherman made his march from Lookout Mountain\r\nto the sea, cutting the Confederacy in two. For thirty years the people\r\nof Pennsylvania have been trying to break a free way to the ocean\r\nthrough the Alleghanies and the oil combination, and in vain. For ten\r\nyears the hope of independent outlet to the sea from the oil-fields\r\nof Pennsylvania lay prostrate under the blow of the surrender of the\r\nTidewater. Twice the people have tried again, only each time to be\r\nheaded off. The first of these two rallies collapsed in the shut-down\r\nof 1887; the second was stopped at the cannon's mouth by an armed force\r\nat Hancock, New York, in the year of peace, 1892.\r\n\r\nBy 1887 the people of the oil regions had recovered from the shock of\r\nlosing the independent Tidewater Pipe Line,[285] and began to make new\r\nplans for getting to the sea. By some means the committee to whom they\r\nhad intrusted the management of the new enterprise was persuaded to go\r\nto New York to confer with the officers of the oil combination, who had\r\nmeasures of conciliation to propose that would make it unnecessary to\r\nbuild the new pipe lines. This committee, and finally the constituency\r\nit represented, were made to believe that the cause of the woes of the\r\noil country was simply and only that there was too much oil--not that\r\nthere were too many empty or half-filled lamps. They agreed to cut\r\ndown their business one-half, and were lured away from the project of\r\ngetting full prices on a full product. The outcome was the \"shut-down\"\r\nof 1887. The producers were persuaded it would bring back oil to a\r\ndollar a barrel--to stay there; but after a brief and unremunerative\r\nspurt in values, a reaction, lasting to the present, carried prices to\r\na lower level than ever, and the producers found that the last state of\r\nthose who let such spirits enter them is always worse than the first.\r\n\r\nSeveral times before this the oil producers had tried to imitate the\r\npolicy of scarcity, which the most brilliant business successes are\r\nteaching to be the royal road to wealth. It is stated by the report of\r\nthe General Council of the Petroleum Producers' Union[286] that the\r\nproducers had twice entered into arrangements with the oil combination\r\nto lessen the product and regulate the price of crude petroleum, and\r\nthat in each case the arrangement had been violated by the latter\r\nwhen it seemed about to become profitable to the producer. Hence,\r\nwhen invited to confer for a third venture of this sort, the Council\r\ndeclined to do so. But in 1887 the invitation, extended for the fourth\r\ntime, was a third time accepted. The producers succeeded in the\r\nrestriction, but they did not better their condition. These men gave\r\nthe world the spectacle of the producers flirting with the solitary and\r\nsupreme buyer of their product, in the belief that he would help them\r\nto raise their price against himself.\r\n\r\nThe agreement which was made with the producers was shown before\r\nCongress.[287] The producers were bound for a year from November 1,\r\n1887, \"to produce at least 17,500 barrels of crude petroleum less per\r\nday,\" and to make it, if possible, \"30,000 barrels less per day.\" In\r\nreturn for this the oil combination agreed to give the speculative\r\nprofits on 6,000,000 barrels of oil--the profits on 5,000,000 for\r\nthem, and on 1,000,000 for their laborers. This move of those who want\r\npetroleum cheap to make it dear is one of the equivocations of policy\r\nin which princes have always distinguished themselves. The need of\r\nthe hour was to stop the building of the competing pipe line. That\r\nwas accomplished by the scheme of the shut-down, which amused the\r\nproducers, and, as subsequent prices proved, did not hurt the buyer of\r\ntheir oil; quite the contrary.\r\n\r\nDrills and pumps at once ceased their operations throughout the oil\r\nregions. Working-men were thrown out of employment, stores were closed,\r\nhundreds of families had to subsist on charity. One of the Broadway\r\nproducers who made this bargain for the shut-down admitted to the\r\ncommittee of the New York Legislature that \"the oil-producing interest\r\nwas abnormally depressed,\" and \"that there was great distress.\"[288]\r\nThe agreement itself recites that the price of petroleum had been\r\nduring the preceding year \"largely below the cost at which it was\r\nproduced.\" The people of the oil country went to work with desperation\r\nto enforce the policy of oil famine. Committees were formed among the\r\nwell-drillers in each district, \"whose duty,\" the formal papers of\r\norganization stated, \"shall be to keep a lookout for and endeavor to\r\nprevent the drilling of wells.\" \"We have no way of stopping those who\r\nwant to drill wells,\" one of the officers of the organization said,\r\n\"only by good, reasonable talk.\" The Well-drillers' Union appointed\r\nand paid one of their members to reason with people who insisted upon\r\ndigging wells. It is not necessary to question the good faith of the\r\nassurance their officials gave Congress that his duties did not require\r\nthe use of nitro-glycerine. But, \"unofficially,\" nitro-glycerine was\r\nfreely used to enforce the shut-down. Men who failed to feel the\r\ninfluence of the \"good talk,\" and went on putting up machinery, and\r\ndrilling wells, would find their derricks blown into kindling-wood.\r\nReferring to one of these occurrences, a member of the Well-drillers'\r\nUnion told Congress it was a case where no permission had been granted\r\nby the union to drill.\r\n\r\n\"Was the rig destroyed?\" he was asked.\r\n\r\n\"The derrick was blowed up by some kind of compound.\"\r\n\r\nThe quantity of the \"compound\" was enough to shake windows six miles\r\ndistant. The derrick and the machinery were \"cheapened\" into junk.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever know of a case of any man's derrick and apparatus being\r\nblown up in the oil region before the formation of this association?\"\r\none of the shut-downers was asked.\r\n\r\n\"I could not say that I do.\"[289]\r\n\r\nThe owner of the apparatus destroyed, it was stated by the press, had\r\nbeen repeatedly requested to join the shut-down, but had refused. There\r\nwere several such occurrences, recalling the affairs at the Buffalo\r\nrefinery in 1885.[290] When the people in Pennsylvania saw apostles of\r\nthe gospel of making oil cheap enter into a bargain with them to make\r\nit scarce, it is not surprising that they should have become bewildered\r\nto the point of thinking that the noise of nitro-glycerine was \"good\r\ntalk,\" and should have sunk into the depression, monetary and moral,\r\nthat alone could make such haggard faces rise among an honest laborious\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the refiners who pass under the control of the\r\ntrust are compelled to make monthly reports. The same perfectness of\r\ndiscipline appears at once among the producers in this shut-down.\r\nEvery one of them had to make monthly reports of how much oil he had\r\ntaken out of the earth. If the mobilization of industry goes on at\r\nthe rate of recent years, it will not be long--not later, perhaps,\r\nthan the end of the nineteenth century--before all producers, and all\r\nmakers, will be sending monthly reports to New York of grain, cattle,\r\niron, wool, lumber, leather, and the manufactures of them to trustees,\r\nwhose \"pleasure it is to try to make them\"--the men as well as the\r\ncommodities--\"cheap.\" The supervision by means of these monthly reports\r\nwas so close that over-production, however minute, was immediately\r\nknown. If the owner of a well over-produced only the one-hundredth of a\r\nbarrel, he got a notice to go slower.[291]\r\n\r\nTo the producers engaged in it the result of the shut-down was\r\nthat when their representatives at the end of it called on the oil\r\ncombination in New York for the profits on the 5,000,000 barrels of\r\noil set apart for them, as agreed, they were given a check for a sum\r\nbetween $200,000 and $250,000.[292] This was divided among those who\r\nhad co-operated--nearly one thousand--in proportion to their share\r\nin the good work of making the supply of the light of the people so\r\nmuch \"less per day.\" The drama of industry has not many scenes more\r\nstriking than this of these men--the principal producers of the oil\r\ncountry, which had yielded in the thirty years up to this time more\r\nthan 300,000,000 barrels of oil--going to the great syndicate in New\r\nYork to buy the privilege of restricting the production of their own\r\nwells, thankfully accepting the scanty profits on a speculative deal\r\nin the oil exchange of 5,000,000 barrels, receiving with emotions of\r\nenthusiasm a check for a couple of hundred thousand dollars for a\r\nyear's \"co-operation\" from the men who had made out of their product\r\nhundreds of millions.\r\n\r\nThe shut-down was a great disappointment in prices. The average price\r\nof petroleum at the wells for October, the month before the shut-down,\r\nwas 70-7/8 cents a barrel. The highest monthly price reached during\r\nthe restriction was 93-5/8, in March, 1888. The average for October,\r\n1888, the last month of the year originally agreed upon, was 90-5/8.\r\nBy a subsequent understanding the restriction was continued until\r\nJuly, 1889. The price then was 95-1/8. At no time during the shut-down\r\nwas the coveted dollar mark maintained, and it was barely touched\r\nin March, 1888, after which there was a sharp decline to 71-3/8 in\r\nJune, with savage losses to \"the lambs.\" High prices did not come\r\nuntil the accumulation of 6,000,000 barrels set aside \"for the use\"\r\nof the producers had been sold out. After that there were in the\r\nwinter following--1889-90--a few months in which the price rose, as to\r\n$1.12-1/2 in November, 1889, but it sank the year following to 60-3/4\r\nin December, 1890, and it continued to go down until crude oil reached\r\n50 cents in October, 1892, the lowest point known since there was an\r\noil market.[293]\r\n\r\nThe men with whom the producers made their bargain, shrewder than they,\r\nand versed in the dynamics of the markets, knew that the effect of\r\nsetting apart 6,000,000 barrels of oil would be ultimately depressive\r\nto prices, not stimulating. Not knowing when or at what price this vast\r\namount would be unloaded, buyers, both for use and for speculation,\r\nwould be made timid, and prices would be held in check. The shut-down\r\nproduced a great gambling mania. Untold millions were lost by men in\r\nthe oil country, who gambled on the exchanges to make the profits\r\nof the expected advance. Local panics, bank failures, ruin in all\r\nits shapes, were the escort of shame and loss which marched with the\r\nshut-down. Curiously enough, it was those who speculated for the rise\r\nwho were the losers. There was against them an element which knew\r\nbetter than they what prices were going to be, for it made them. It\r\nis this ability of insiders to bet on a certainty which has been the\r\ndestruction of the oil exchanges. From Pittsburg to New York they are\r\nnow practically all dead.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the reduction effected by the shut-down, independent of a\r\nnatural decline which had set in some months before, has been estimated\r\nat 11,000,000 to 15,000,000 barrels. The production ran down from\r\n25,798,000 barrels in 1886 to 21,478,883 in 1887, and 16,488,688 in\r\n1888. In 1889 it was up to 21,487,435 again, and in 1890, 29,130,910.\r\n\r\nThe price of light advanced. When the negotiations were in progress the\r\nproducers were told that if the flow of oil glutting the market could\r\nbe stopped the price of refined could be advanced, and that for every\r\neighth of a cent a gallon advance in it the producers could expect an\r\nadvance of 4 cents a barrel on their crude oil. Refined advanced during\r\nthe shut-down to a price to correspond to which the crude should have\r\nrisen to 96 cents a barrel. Instead, its price fell to 78 cents. The\r\ncommittee went to New York \"to protest.\" Their New York ally said there\r\nwas no change in the markets of the world. That they could get the\r\nprice for the refined, but they did not propose to hold up the price of\r\nthe crude. \"If we could not do that, they could not help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had refined to sell, and crude to buy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"[294]\r\n\r\nThis shut-down, the New York _Tribune_ said, was \"one of the most\r\ninteresting economical experiments made in recent years.\" It was, as\r\nthe New York _World_ said, \"one of the largest restrictive movements\r\never attempted in commerce.\" The president of the trust, when examined\r\non February 27, 1888, by the New York Legislature, as to the agreement\r\nfor the shut-down, declared positively that nothing of the kind had\r\nbeen done.\r\n\r\n\"There has been no such agreement?\" he was asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, sir!... Oil has run freely all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no attempt to do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"[295]\r\n\r\nHe afterwards recalled these denials, and excused himself on the ground\r\nthat as he had been in Europe when the arrangement was made he had\r\nknown of it only \"incidentally.\"[296] A \"shut-down\" on facts is as\r\nnecessary to the success of the schemes for scarcity as a shut-down in\r\noil. There are too many facts, as well as too much oil.\r\n\r\n\"By advancing the price of the crude material you necessarily advance\r\nthe price of the refined?\" another of the combination was asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"[297]\r\n\r\nThe average price of refined at New York for export was 6.75\r\ncents a gallon in 1887. This rose to 7.50 in 1888, the highest\r\naverage price for any year between 1885 and 1893.[298] The effect\r\nof the restriction--\"one of the most extensive ever attempted in\r\ncommerce\"--was thus to make oil and light and all its other products\r\nscarcer and dearer. The producers really got no good. After the\r\nshut-down had been in progress five months, their committee issued\r\nan address congratulating them on the \"glorious results\" achieved in\r\nthe fidelity with which the pledge of restriction had been kept, but\r\ncontinued, \"But prices are not yet remunerative.\"[299]\r\n\r\n\"We do not seem to have gotten it,\" one of the producers said to\r\nCongress, referring to the assistance they expected in an advance of\r\nthe price to profitable figures.[300] No lasting gain came to any one\r\nunless to the monopoly, and it is possibly too soon to tell whether its\r\ngain will be \"lasting.\"\r\n\r\nPart of the speculation was that the profits of 2,000,000 barrels,\r\ncontributed equally by the combination and the producers, were to be\r\ndistributed among the working-men affected by the loss of employment.\r\nMen who had been earning $12 a day received a dollar a day from this\r\nfund, and lay idle.[301] A blistering picture of the condition of the\r\nregion is to be seen in the testimony of one of the producers.\r\n\r\n\"The payments that you have made, or that your assembly has made, have\r\nbeen to individuals?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"State what the character of the occupation of the individuals thus\r\nrelieved was in relation to the shut-in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pumpers and roustabout men who had families sick and impoverished.\r\nThat was a source of relief to them, and we did not withhold it. It was\r\nin our community, and we thought we could well afford to allow them\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what did you pay them?\"\r\n\r\n\"For charity's sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you give them any occupation?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had it not to give; we gave them money instead.\"[302]\r\n\r\nThis was the melancholy end of the great shut-down. But the people\r\nwere not broken by their new failure. They did not lie long in the\r\ncul-de-sac into which they had been trapped. There is a magnificent\r\nreserve force of public spirit and love of liberty in the province\r\nof William Penn and the chosen State of Benjamin Franklin. The oil\r\nbusiness has been a thirty years' war. The people have been whipped\r\nuntil one would suppose defeat had become part of their daily routine,\r\nbut there have always been enough good men who did not know they were\r\nbeaten to begin fighting again early the next morning. It was so when\r\nthe independents of Pennsylvania took the pool of the oil trust's pipe\r\nlines and the railroads before the Interstate Commerce Commission,\r\nonly to reap the unexpected demonstration that the tribunal created by\r\nCongress to prevent and punish discrimination was but one more theatre\r\nfor litigation and delay.[303] Leaving their cause on the floor of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, these men went forth for the seventy\r\nand seventh time to build a pipe line of their own, on which they are\r\nnow busy. Their numbers, resources, and hopes are less, but their will\r\nand courage are undiminished. To-day, in northwestern and western\r\nPennsylvania this small, determined body of men are going forward with\r\na new campaign in their gallant struggle for the control of their own\r\nbusiness. Their efforts have been, a friendly observer says, not too\r\nwarmly, as heroic and noble and self-sacrificing as the uprising of a\r\nnation for independence.\r\n\r\nOf all this very little has been known outside the oil regions, for\r\nthe reason that the newspapers there are mostly owned or controlled\r\nby the oil combination,[304] or fear its power. The last independent\r\ndaily in northwestern Pennsylvania became neutral when the threat\r\nwas made to place a rival in the field. With sympathy from but few\r\nof the home press, ridiculed by the \"reptile\" papers, and met at\r\nevery turn by crushing opposition, and annoyances great and little\r\nfrom spies and condottieri, these men are, in 1894, working quietly\r\nand manfully to cut their way through to a free market and a right\r\nto live. Their new pipe line has been met with the same unrelenting,\r\nopen, and covert warfare that made every previous march to the sea so\r\nweary. The railroads, the members of the oil combination, and every\r\nprivate interest these could influence have been united against them.\r\nAs all through the history of the independent pipe lines, the officials\r\nof the railways have exhausted the possibilities of opposition. At\r\nWilkes-barre, where a great net-work of tracks had to be got under,\r\nall the roads united to send seven lawyers into court to fight for\r\ninjunctions against the single-handed counsel for the producers. They\r\npleaded again the technicalities which had been invoked afresh at\r\nevery crossing, although always brushed away by the judges, as they\r\nwere here again. Though they have allowed their right of way to be\r\nused without charge for pipe lines which were to compete with them,\r\nthe railroads refused to allow the independents to make a crossing,\r\neven though they had the legal right to cross. Not content with the\r\nchamperty of collusive injunctions, they have resorted to physical\r\nforce, and the pipe-layers of the independents have been confronted\r\nby hundreds of armed railroad employés. When they have dug trenches,\r\nthe railroad men have filled them up as fast. Appeal to the courts has\r\nalways given the right of way to the independents, but the tactics\r\nagainst them are renewed at every crossing because they cost them heart\r\nand money, and they have not the same unlimited supply of the latter as\r\nof the former. Their telegraph-poles have been cut down, lawyers and\r\nland-agents have been sent in advance of them to make leases of the\r\nfarmers for a year or two of the land it was known they would want. For\r\na few dollars earnest-money to bind the bargain, a great deal of land\r\ncan be tied up in such ways. In some cases conditional offers would\r\nbe made guaranteeing the owner five times as much as the independents\r\nwould give, whatever that might be. Further to cripple them, a bill\r\nwas introduced into the Pennsylvania Legislature and strongly pushed,\r\nrepealing the law giving pipe-line companies the right of eminent\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nThe Erie, which has let the combination lay its pipe lines upon its\r\nright of way, and bore there for oil,[305] has been conspicuous in its\r\nefforts to prevent the new pipe line from getting through. The line at\r\nlast reached Hancock, New York; there it had to pass under the Erie\r\nRailroad bridge in the bed of the river. The last Saturday night in\r\nNovember, 1892, the quiet of Hancock was disturbed by the arrival\r\nof one hundred armed men, railroad employés, by special train. They\r\nunlimbered a cannon, established a day and night patrol, built a beacon\r\nto be fired as an appeal for reinforcements, put up barracks, and left\r\ntwenty men to go into winter quarters. Dynamite was part of their\r\narmament, and they were equipped with grappling-irons, cant-hooks,\r\nand other tools to pull the pipe up if laid. Cannon are a part of the\r\nregular equipment of the combination, as they are used to perforate\r\ntanks in which the oil takes fire. To let the \"independents\" know what\r\nthey were to expect the cannon was fired at ten o'clock at night,\r\nwith a report that shook the people and the windows for miles about.\r\nThese opponents of competition were willing and ready to kill though\r\ntheir rights were dubious, and there could be no pretence that full\r\nsatisfaction could not be got through the courts if any wrong was done.\r\n\r\nFor weeks Hancock remained in a state of armed occupation by a private\r\nmilitary force. Referring to this demonstration with a private\r\narmy at a moment of profound peace, the Buffalo _Express_ said of\r\nthose responsible for it: \"They continue to fight with their old\r\nweapons--incendiarism and riot.\" No case has been come across in which\r\nthe railroads made any opposition in the courts to the oil trust\r\ncrossing under their tracks with its pipe line. More than once the\r\nrailroads have allowed this rival carrier to lay its pipes side by side\r\nwith their rails.\r\n\r\n\"Now, is your pipe line to New York laid upon the right of way of any\r\nrailroad?\"\r\n\r\n\"It touches at times the Erie road, and crosses the Erie road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you pay anything for that to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"[306]\r\n\r\nBut never have the railroads failed to compel an independent pipe\r\nline to fight through the courts for every crossing it needed. It has\r\nmade no difference how often or emphatically the law has sustained the\r\nright of the people to make such crossings. The next attempt would be\r\nresisted on the same ground, and with the same desperate determination\r\n\"to overcome competition\" for the favorite. The local line laid by the\r\nindependents in 1892 between Coraopolis and Titusville had to pass\r\nunder the Erie, the Lake Shore, the Pan Handle, the Western New York,\r\nand the Pennsylvania railroads, and in every case had to encounter\r\nneedless litigation to do so. It was victorious, for the roads did\r\nnot dare go to trial, though the managers, one after the other, to\r\nhelp cripple competition, spent the money of the stockholders in what\r\nwas perfectly well known to be a hopeless opposition. A correspondent\r\nof the Bradford _Record_ wrote: \"When the news reached Bradford that\r\nthe Erie Railroad had sold her independence to the combination, that\r\nthe latter might defeat honorable competition and continue to rob the\r\npeople, that one hundred men and a cannon confronted the United States\r\nPipe Line at Hancock, who could have censured the outraged producers\r\nof Bradford for blowing the great Kinzua viaduct out of the Kinzua\r\nvalley? Who could blame the bankrupt producers of the oil country for\r\ndestroying every dollar's worth of the combination's property wherever\r\nfound? The people are getting desperate; they are ready, like the\r\nblind Samson, to pull down the pillars of the temple, even though they\r\nthemselves fall crushed to death amid the ruins.\" These are wild, even\r\nwicked words, but is it not a portent that such words rise out of the\r\nheart of an honest community?\r\n\r\nThis opposition, with show of force and threats of violence, was\r\nsuccessful. In February, 1893, after months of facing the cannon and\r\nthe private army which the railroad maintained for the oil combination,\r\nit was publicly announced by the president of the new pipe line that\r\nthe route by Hancock must be abandoned. Many thousands of dollars\r\nand time worth even more were lost. \"Suppose,\" said a daily paper of\r\nBinghamton, \"that a body of laboring men had unlimbered a cannon and\r\nstationed armed men to suppress competition, what denunciation of the\r\noutrage there would have been!\"\r\n\r\nA new way through Wilkes-barre was chosen after the retreat from\r\nHancock, and by that route the independent producers and refiners, with\r\nhope long deferred, are now seeking to finish their march to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe producers are poor men, and their resources for this unequal\r\ncontest come from the sale of oil, and day by day the price of oil was\r\ndepressed until it sank to the neighborhood of half a dollar a barrel.\r\nThere has been some recovery since, but still the lowest prices of\r\nmany years are being made, and the producers are finding the burden\r\nof their escape very heavy. \"It is the honest belief of all oil men,\"\r\nsays one of them, \"that the low price of oil for the year is due to\r\nefforts to make the producer so poor that he cannot carry through his\r\npipe line.\" This is the enterprise of the independent refiners as well\r\nas producers. Against these refiners, therefore, the market for refined\r\noil also is manipulated. Very fantastic have been the operations of the\r\n\"unchanging\" laws of supply and demand under this manipulation. The\r\nindependents found that in the export market of New York, in the spring\r\nof 1894, petroleum, just as it came from the pipe line crude from the\r\nnether earth, was quoted at a higher price a barrel than the same oil\r\nafter it had gone through all the processes of refining and was aboard\r\nship ready for the lamps of Europe or Asia.[307]\r\n\r\nTo throw another obstacle in the way of the new line, the oil trust in\r\n1893 began again the game of 1878, of refusing to relieve producers of\r\ntheir oil with its pipe lines. As in 1878, the oil was left to run to\r\nwaste. Then, the object was to compel the producers to sell it \"always\r\nbelow the market\";[308] now, it was to force them to sign a contract\r\nnot to patronize any other pipe lines. Producers who refused to sign\r\nthis contract, in order to be free to join the new line when it was\r\nfinished, were refused an outlet, and they had to pump their oil on\r\nthe ground while appealing to the courts to compel this common carrier\r\nto do its duty.[309] When they applied for a mandamus the combination\r\nreceded from its position without waiting for a trial.\r\n\r\nThis has been a warfare on more than a new competitor; it is an\r\nattempt to suppress improvement and invention. A new idea in oil\r\ntransportation, which promises a revolution in the industry, was hit\r\nupon by these independents. This was that pipe lines could be used\r\nto send refined oil long distances to market as well as crude. The\r\nannouncement of their plans to do this was met with the ridicule of\r\nthose who control the existing pipe lines to the seaboard and do not\r\nwish to see their old-fashioned methods of piping crude oil alone\r\ndisturbed. But the independents went on with their idea. They have\r\nproved it practicable. Now, for the first time in the history of the\r\noil industry, a pipe line transports oil ready for the lamp. Refined\r\noil is piped from Titusville to Wilkes-barre with no loss of quality.\r\nMany hundred thousand barrels of it have been piped for nearly three\r\nhundred miles, and not a barrel has been rejected by the inspection,\r\neither at New York or its destination abroad. The success of the\r\nexperiment proves that it can be piped to New York.\r\n\r\nThe independents press on. Occasionally one of them, says a local\r\njournal, unhinged by the loss of property, commits suicide or is taken\r\nto an insane asylum, and another goes down out of sight in bankruptcy,\r\nbut the others close the ranks and go on, and now about 4000 men, in a\r\nstrongly organized association, are marching side by side towards the\r\nsea--the blue and free.[310]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPURCHASE OF PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nHunting about for tax-dodgers, it was discovered by the authorities\r\nof Pennsylvania some years ago that many foreign corporations were\r\ndoing business within the limits of the Commonwealth and enjoying\r\nthe protection of her laws, and at the same time not paying for it.\r\nForemost among these delinquents stood the principal company in the\r\noil combination with its mammoth capital, practically buying, refining\r\nand controlling nearly the entire oil production of the State, \"and\r\nyet failing to pay one cent into the public treasury.\" So wrote the\r\nAuditor-General to his successor in 1882. The combination, beginning,\r\nlike creation, with nothing, had grown, until in 1883 it was so rich\r\nthat, according to the testimony of one of its members, it owned\r\n\"between $40,000,000 and $50,000,000\" in Pennsylvania alone.[311] But\r\nthough doing business in Pennsylvania, and legally within the grasp\r\nof the taxing power, as decided by the courts, this company paid no\r\ntaxes, and would not give the State the information called for by law\r\nas to its taxable property. It practised \"voluntary taxation.\" \"For\r\neight years,\" Auditor-General Schell says, \"it had been doing business\r\nin this Commonwealth, and had failed in all that time to file a single\r\nreport.\" \"It was not necessary for the department to call upon it to\r\nmake reports.\" The law required these reports specifically and in\r\ndetails that could not be misunderstood, and that was notification\r\nenough. But year after year the Auditor-Generals, whose duty it was to\r\ncollect due contribution from each taxpayer, made special demands upon\r\nthis one for reports in compliance with the law, but with no effect.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 William P. Schell became Auditor-General, and began, shortly\r\nafter taking his oath, to see if he could find out what taxes were due\r\nfrom this concern, and how they could be collected. He sent official\r\ncirculars to the company in 1878, 1879, 1880, but \"there was no reply\r\nmade at any time.\"[312] His predecessor had had the same experience.\r\nHe then sent one of his force to Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and New York\r\nto investigate. Whenever he could get the names of persons familiar\r\nwith the workings of the company he would visit them, to find himself\r\nusually \"not much further ahead than when he started.\"[313] \"It was\r\nimpossible to get any information. Even the men we talked to deceived\r\nus. Men came to Harrisburg to give us information, and afterwards we\r\nfound they were in the interests of the company.\"[314] The department\r\nfound itself, the Auditor-General wrote to his successor, \"foiled at\r\nall points, not only by the refusal of the company to respond to the\r\nnotices sent to its officers, but also by the great reticence of all\r\npersons in any manner connected with or employed by the company.\"\r\n\r\nThese efforts to find out the nature and character of the business of\r\nthe company extended through two or three years. The first workable\r\nindication that the company was taxable in Pennsylvania came when the\r\nGovernor of Ohio, in answer to inquiries, sent the Attorney-General a\r\ncopy of the charter of the company. The Auditor-General wrote to the\r\nGovernor and Auditor-General of New York and the Governor of Ohio for\r\ninformation. Letters were sent to the president and principal members\r\nof the company at Cleveland, Oil City, New York, and elsewhere. An\r\nanswer was finally received from the company's attorney. He said that\r\nthe company was not subject to taxation. The department replied the\r\nsame day refusing to accept this view, and insisting on reports. Then\r\nthe lawyer replied that the books and papers \"were at Cleveland, and it\r\nwould take some time to prepare reports.\" The Auditor-General offered\r\nto send his clerk to Cleveland \"by first train,\" to prepare the reports\r\nfor the company if assurance was given that he would be permitted to\r\nexamine the books of the company when he got there.\r\n\r\nNo reply to this request was ever received. Then telegrams were sent,\r\nseveral days in succession, asking for reports, offering more time\r\nif the company would agree to report within any reasonable time, and\r\nfinally warning the company that if it did not comply with the law and\r\nfile its reports the Auditor-General would act under the authority\r\ngiven him by the law, and charge it with taxes estimated on such\r\n\"reasonable data\" as he could procure. All the department could get\r\nwere evasive letters or telegrams from the counsel in New York, such\r\nas \"letter explaining on the way.\" The letter came with the valuable\r\ninformation that \"the officers are out of the city, and the company\r\nwill answer on their return.\" Another \"reply\" was: \"I have failed to\r\nget replies from the absent officers.\"[315] No reports forthcoming,\r\nthe Auditor-General at last, on the best information he could get,\r\nbacked by affidavits which were placed on file in the archives of his\r\noffice, calculated the taxes due from 1872 to 1881, with penalties,\r\nat $3,145,541.64. This was totalled on an estimate, supported by\r\naffidavit, that the profits of the company had been two to three\r\nmillions a year from 1872 to 1876, and ten to twelve millions a year\r\nfrom 1876 to 1880, figures which what is now known show to have been\r\nnear the truth. After fixing upon this amount, and before charging it\r\nagainst the company, the latter was given still another chance, and\r\nanother. Two telegrams were sent notifying that the estimated tax would\r\nbe entered up if \"the refusal to report\" was persisted in. The last\r\ntelegram said: \"Still hoping that reports will come from the company,\r\nso that we will have some data to act upon.\"\r\n\r\nNo word of reply came.\r\n\r\nThen the Auditor-General formally entered the amount he had estimated\r\non his books, as the law authorized him to do.[316] His investigations\r\nhad consumed his entire term, and the filing of this estimate was\r\nalmost his last official act. It is a fact of record that after all\r\nthis, officers of the company, in seeking to have this estimate of\r\ntaxes due set aside, stated in writing that \"there was no neglect\r\nor refusal on the part of said company to furnish any report or\r\ninformation which could lawfully be required of it by any officer or\r\nunder any law of the State of Pennsylvania.\"[317]\r\n\r\nSuit was now brought by the Attorney-General of the State to recover\r\nthis tax, as was his duty, and then the company began to stir\r\nitself. To assist him in procuring and interpreting evidence the\r\nAttorney-General, who knew nothing of the oil business, obtained\r\nthe services of a man who knew more about it than any one else in\r\nPennsylvania. This person was a practical oil man. He was one of the\r\nleaders of the producers and refiners' association, which in the\r\nexciting times of 1872, when law and order in Pennsylvania stood on\r\nthe edge of a crater, compelled the railroads to abandon the South\r\nImprovement scheme, \"in name,\" and to give in writing the pledge that\r\n\"all arrangements for the transportation of oil after this date shall\r\nbe upon the basis of perfect equality to all,\" though he could not\r\nfind a way to make them keep the pledge. He was prominent six years\r\nlater in the uprising of the people when they found that all these\r\npromises were being broken, and all their rights on the highways being\r\nviolated. It was largely through his influence that the producers\r\ndetermined to proceed against the oil combination as a criminal\r\nconspiracy, and procured the indictment of its principals in Clarion\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania, on charges of crime.[318] \"When,\" as was said\r\nbefore the Pennsylvania Legislative Committee of 1883, \"the doors of\r\nthe penitentiary were gaping wide to receive them; when a true bill had\r\nbeen found before the Grand Jury; when, if they ever were in jeopardy\r\nbefore to-day, they were in jeopardy.\"\r\n\r\nHe was chairman of the Committee on Transportation of the Oil\r\nProducers' Association, and was one of the \"legal committee\" of five\r\nwho represented the producers in having the \"anti-discrimination suits\"\r\nbrought and pushed against the Pennsylvania Railroad by the State\r\nin 1879. By these suits the discriminations and favoritisms, which,\r\nthough known, it had till then been impossible to prove, were forced\r\ninto the light as facts, and the evidence was furnished without which\r\nthe indictments just referred to could not have been found. When the\r\naccused, frightened at last, succeeded in getting the aroused producers\r\nto agree not to push the criminal trial, in consideration of a solemn\r\npledge that all secrecy and favoritism in transportation should be\r\ngiven up, he withdrew from the negotiations and would not sign the\r\ncompromise. He had assisted the Congressional Committees of Commerce at\r\nWashington in 1872 and 1876 in their ill-starred investigations, and\r\nhad been active in the effort to get another investigation begun in\r\n1880. He had also been one of the principal witnesses before the New\r\nYork Legislative investigation of 1879. For eighteen years he had been\r\non this quest. With him the Attorney-General now arranged to get the\r\nevidence on which the State could support its claim for taxes.\r\n\r\nThe members of the great corporation saw that they must act. In\r\nout-going Auditor-General Schell they had met the first officer of\r\nthe people who was as determined to make them pay as they were not to\r\npay. The policy of silence and nullification was abandoned. One of\r\nthe members of the trust came in person to the State capital to see\r\nthe Attorney-General. He made an unexpected overture. He volunteered\r\nto furnish the State with a full disclosure of the facts it needed to\r\nprove its claim.\r\n\r\n\"I confess,\" said the Deputy Attorney-General, \"that I little knew in\r\nwhat direction to cross-examine him.\"[319] He therefore sent for the\r\nexpert who had been employed by the Attorney-General. The \"trustee\"\r\nprotested against his presence; but the Deputy Attorney-General said\r\nthat he had been employed by the State, and it would be necessary that\r\nhe should take part. The representative of the trust, moved, as he\r\nafterwards testified, by the patriotic consideration that \"the regular\r\ncumbersome way of taking oral testimony ... would result in great labor\r\nand expense to the State, and would be an obstruction and labor to us\r\nthat could be avoided,\" made a suggestion that the State go to the\r\ntrial of the case upon a statement of facts of their business which he\r\nand his associates would make. This offer to become a volunteer witness\r\nwas agreed to, and the delinquent corporation and the State went into\r\ncourt with an \"agreement as to facts.\" The Attorney-General reserved\r\nfor the State the right to add to these facts, but did not at any time\r\nduring the proceedings do so.\r\n\r\nHis expert shrewdly foresaw that another defeat for the people was to\r\nbe the result of this policy. \"I objected very strenuously,\" he says.\r\n\"It was my pet scheme to examine them orally in court or by commission,\r\nand I gave it up very reluctantly. I told the Attorney-General I could\r\nnot believe those gentlemen were in earnest, that I knew I could ask\r\na string of questions of any one of them which if answered would have\r\ngiven the case away to the State.\"[320] But the Attorney-General,\r\nthe same who as counsel for the people, in 1879, against the members\r\nof the same corporation, led his clients to defeat, overruled him.\r\nThe old campaigner saw the mistake of 1880 about to be repeated, and\r\nan agreement with the offenders substituted for trial and for the\r\ndefeat of them he believed would follow. He determined to prevent\r\nthe consummation of this second catastrophe. He sent his counsel to\r\nNew York to the headquarters of the oil combination with a notice\r\nthat he would not adhere to the bargain made by the Attorney-General\r\nat Harrisburg with reference to \"the agreement of facts.\" \"I propose\r\nto attack,\" was the message he sent.[321] He was to have received\r\ncompensation from the State. He believed that this gave him an interest\r\nin the matter sufficient to gain a footing in the courts for action by\r\nhimself independently of the Attorney-General. In pursuance of this\r\nidea, when the case came up for trial, he appeared with his private\r\ncounsel ready to take part in the proceedings if permitted.\r\n\r\nThe notice of attack was received \"with surprise,\" but was met with a\r\ncharacteristic move. \"I raised the question with him\"--the counsel--\"as\r\nto what possible motive\" his client \"had in the matter,\" the \"trustee\"\r\ntestifies, \"and as to whether it would not be better for him to desist\r\nfrom it; whether it would not be possible for us, if he was needing\r\nbusiness, to find some position in which he could legitimately earn\r\na living.\"[322] The lawyer replied that he had no right to treat on\r\nany such basis, and withdrew from all connection with the case. But\r\nthis was the opening of a negotiation which through another lawyer\r\n\"resulted,\" as the expert of the State afterwards confessed, \"in peace\r\nbetween us.\" He had given notice that he meant to attack, and the\r\n\"negotiation\" which followed \"was whether anybody would give me as much\r\nas there was in my contract with the State if I would not attack.\"[323]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Attorney-General marched gayly to another defeat of his\r\nclient--the people--going into court with no other ammunition than the\r\nfacts furnished by the men he was suing. He did not put his expert,\r\nnor the Auditor-General, nor his assistant, nor the men on whose\r\ninformation and affidavits the estimate had been made of taxes due,\r\nnor any one else on the stand. He was \"perfectly satisfied,\" he says,\r\n\"that these facts were true,\" and that the company were \"in good faith\r\ndoing exactly what they undertook to do--namely, to furnish me with\r\nall the information that was necessary to establish the Commonwealth\r\ncase.\"[324]\r\n\r\nHis method was as singular with the argument as with the testimony.\r\nHe insisted, in opposition to the opinion of Auditor-General Schell,\r\nthat such a corporation must pay taxes on all its capital stock,\r\nwhether it represented property in the State or out of it. The court\r\ndecided against him. It held that it was taxable \"only on so much of\r\nits capital stock as was represented by the business and property of\r\nthe company within the State.\" As to what the amount of this property\r\nand business within the State was the court took the facts furnished\r\nby the delinquent itself, as they were the only ones presented to it\r\nby the Attorney-General. The amount originally charged for taxes by\r\nAuditor-General Schell, who had forced the fighting, was $3,145,541.64.\r\nThe Attorney-General, on his mistaken theory of the law and on the\r\nfacts volunteered by those he was suing, had \"split the difference\" and\r\nsued for only $796,642.20. The court cut this down to $33,270.59, and\r\non appeal this was still further reduced to $22,660.10.[325]\r\n\r\nThis decision was not final or conclusive as to either the State or the\r\ncompany, both of whom afterwards sued out writs of error. The expert,\r\nwho had been pushed to one side, at once determined to take what steps\r\nhe could to reopen the case and mend the fortunes of the State. The\r\nmoment the decision was announced he telegraphed the Attorney-General\r\nagain for another conference, and was told to come to Philadelphia. He\r\ntold the Attorney-General that he thought \"the hope of the State to get\r\nthe largest amount of money was to get a rehearing and let us have an\r\noral examination.\" But the \"satisfied\" Attorney-General refused to do\r\nanything but carry the same argument and the same agreement of facts up\r\nto the Supreme Court. He refused to move for a new trial, and not only\r\ntold his expert so, but told the \"trustee\" so. The trustee, by one of\r\nthose coincidences which prove how much better it is to be born lucky\r\nthan rich, happened to have come at the same time to stay in the same\r\nhotel with the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that the expert pointed out omissions of property and\r\nfacts which he thought \"had not been clearly shown in the agreement\r\nas to facts,\" and afterwards other matters he had discovered. After\r\nthe defeat of the State he prepared an affidavit containing additional\r\nfacts. He employed an attorney in the preparation of this affidavit and\r\na petition to the court to have the case reopened. His purpose was \"to\r\nget another chance at this trial.\"\r\n\r\n\"To get another trial?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another hearing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything.\" Anything to prevent the miscarriage of this last attempt to\r\n\"round up\" the men he had been trying for nearly twenty years to bring\r\nto justice. The Attorney-General would not present this petition. After\r\nthis, still before the final decision, he saw the Attorney-General\r\nagain to renew his pressure for a change of policy. Three times he saw\r\nthe Attorney-General to lay his additional facts before him, and urge\r\nthat a different method of conducting the case be tried.[326] Some of\r\nthe new points he raised the Attorney-General referred and deferred to\r\nthe company he was pursuing, and \"we showed him how they were fully\r\nincluded in the statement rendered by us to the State, and he (the\r\nAttorney-General) expressed his entire satisfaction with every point\r\nraised.\" Others of the new points the Attorney-General declared to be\r\n\"immaterial.\"[327] The Attorney-General showed no wish to bring proof\r\ninto the case of any facts except those furnished by the people being\r\nsued. Although the decision of the lower court had been a warning that\r\nthe theory on which the State had gone into court was bad, and that\r\nthe amount of taxes to be recovered depended on the amount of tangible\r\nproperty in the State, he refused to use the right he acknowledged he\r\nhad--to call other witnesses, to put the men who had made the agreed\r\nstatement of facts upon the stand, and cross-examine them.\r\n\r\nFrom the Attorney-General, who knew little of either the facts, as he\r\nconfessed, or the law as the court declared it, who accepted their\r\nstatements as gospel, and who asked them whether new facts offered\r\nhim should be admitted into his side of the case against them, the\r\ncompany had nothing to fear. But this old opponent of theirs, whom\r\nthe Attorney-General had employed, was at large, and was a dangerous\r\nman. He knew the facts; he had the right theory of the law; he was\r\ntremendously in earnest. The case had only got as far as the first\r\ndecision of the lower court. There were still opportunities for all\r\nkinds of legal proceedings. By virtue of this contract he claimed such\r\nan interest in the proceedings as to give him a right to ask the courts\r\nto interfere. He might get a new trial and carry out his \"pet scheme\r\nof oral examination.\" He might rouse the people as he had roused them\r\nbefore. He might interfere through the Legislature. He might raise a\r\nstorm which could not be quieted until in this suit, or some other, his\r\npet plan might be carried out, of getting these silent gentlemen into a\r\nwitness-box. He considered himself to be in the service of the State.\r\n\"I was under a contract with the State,\"[328] he says. And we find the\r\nAttorney-General in close consultation with him in Philadelphia down to\r\nthe very last day.\r\n\r\nThe company sees that something must be done, and does it. Its\r\n\"trustee\" calls upon the expert at his hotel.[329] He renews the\r\nsuggestion he had made in New York when word had been sent by\r\nthe expert that he would not be bound by the agreement of facts,\r\nand \"proposed to attack.\" He finds his man cast down, utterly\r\ndiscouraged by the decision of the lower court and the attitude of\r\nthe Attorney-General. Time and again he had seen the people denied\r\njustice, and their enemies escape even so much as the necessity of\r\nappearing in court. He had seen, in every one of the proceedings\r\nagainst them, from 1872 to 1880, committees of Congress, State\r\ngovernors, judges of the Supreme courts, State legislatures,\r\nattorney-generals, railroad officials, every trustee of the people,\r\nwilt, like green leaves in a fire, before this flashing wealth. His\r\nresolution gave way. He was to have received, under his agreement\r\nwith the Attorney-General, in salary and commissions, $23,000, or\r\nless, according to the amount recovered. That he saw fading out of\r\nsight in consequence of the, to him, inexplicable course of the\r\nAttorney-General. Every one else who had tried to stand up for the\r\npeople against this power had gone down; why should he be quixotic and\r\npoor?\r\n\r\n\"We want peace,\" the \"trustee\" said, and the, till then, faithful\r\nfriend of the people sold him all he had of that commodity for $15,400,\r\nto be paid in instalments, and a salary of $5000 for a year.\r\n\r\n\"I proposed to reopen it\"--the case--\"and I did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply because I was assured I should have just as much money out of\r\nthe transaction as my original contract would have paid me.\"\r\n\r\nThis confession made on the stand, under the strain of\r\ncross-examination in a civil suit in which he was a witness, startled\r\nthe country with its first hint of the real cause of the failure of\r\nthe great tax case, and led to an investigation by the Legislature of\r\nPennsylvania.[330]\r\n\r\nThe first payment was $7500. This was paid, not in a check, as is the\r\nusual method between business men in legitimate transactions, but in\r\nbank-notes--$500's or $1000's.[331] That this method of payment was\r\ninconvenient and unusual was shown by the statement of the recipient,\r\nthat he went to the Chemical Bank and got a bank certificate for his\r\n$7500 of bank-notes. \"Of course I did not carry that amount of money\r\naround with me.[332] Bank-notes and bank drafts, not the company's\r\nchecks, were used in the succeeding payments also.\r\n\r\n\"In sending him money to Titusville, where you had a bank account, why\r\ndid you not send him a check on your own bank or draft?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there was nobody at Titusville who had any knowledge of the\r\nmatter. It was not necessary to acquaint them with it,\" said the\r\n\"trustee.\"[333]\r\n\r\nThis representative of the company was diligent in business, as he\r\nunderstood business, and was always forehanded. He made the first\r\nmoves and kept the lead. He went all the way to Harrisburg to meet the\r\nAttorney-General. He got control of the case by making the overture\r\nto volunteer testimony. He called first on the lawyer sent to New\r\nYork with notice of \"attack,\" called first on the State's expert in\r\nPhiladelphia and New York, made the first suggestion for \"peace,\" and\r\ngot it \"cheap.\"[334] But after he had bought \"peace\" the next interview\r\nis at the company's office. The other man must walk now. When put on\r\nthe stand, the purchaser, of course, denied that this \"purchase of\r\npeace\" had anything to do with the case against his company, or with\r\nthe suppression of the only expert in the employ of the State in that\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\n\"With reference to the tax case,\" he said, \"the payment of this money\r\nhad no bearing whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you pay him the money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have already said, two or three times, that I paid him the\r\nmoney for the purpose of having him desist from further malicious\r\nattacks upon our company.\"\r\n\r\nThe man of whom he had bought \"peace\" was not then engaged in any\r\nproceedings against \"our company,\" except the tax case. He had been\r\nengaged in nothing for two years, since the proceedings of the\r\nProducers' Association in 1880. There were no other movements in\r\nprospect. The only war, actual or contemplated, was this tax war.\r\nPressed through several pages of cross-examination, and challenged to\r\nname a single instance of war by this man upon them, at the time of\r\nthe purchase of \"peace,\" or since 1880, which would account for their\r\nwillingness to pay him so large a sum, he was finally forced to say: \"I\r\ncannot do it.\"[335]\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General, who had thought it unnecessary to collect more\r\ntestimony by putting the defendants on the stand under oath, testified,\r\nof course, that there had been no suppression of testimony. The seller\r\nof peace himself, when he was afterwards brought to book before the\r\nLegislature, attempted to stand to a similar denial that he had in\r\nany way been unfaithful to his trust as the expert of the State and\r\nrepresentative of the people. But he broke down. He was asked if his\r\nagreement with the company had any relation to this case.\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably. To all cases--this case and all others.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were to do nothing further for the Commonwealth in this or any\r\nother case?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the Supreme Court had subsequently reversed the case, and it\r\nhad gone back for a new trial, and had been tried before a jury, so\r\nthat the company's officers could have been subpoenaed and compelled\r\nto testify, would you then, after receiving this money, have been\r\nat liberty to assist in getting that testimony together for the\r\nCommonwealth, and aiding the Commonwealth?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were free to do it prior to your arrangement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"By whom was it\"--the negotiation--\"begun?\" he was asked.\r\n\r\n\"By the representative of the company,\" he replied, naming him.[336]\r\n\r\nWhen this bargain was arranged and the first payment made only an\r\nopinion had been filed. No judgment had been entered. There was still\r\ntime to make any one of many moves. Reargument and new trial both were\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThese men seduced this representative of the people only to cast him\r\naside, as seducers always do. They did not pay him \"cash down\" when\r\nthey bought his \"peace,\" but in instalments, and part of his pay was in\r\nthe shape of $5000 for a year's service for which he was to do no work.\r\nThis kept the whip-hand of him until the tax matter was finally settled\r\nand irrevocably past reopening. When that had been done they cast him\r\noff with scorching contumely. The secretary of the trust waved him into\r\nobloquy as a black-mailer.\r\n\r\nWhen the trustee who negotiated the \"peace\" was before the committee\r\nof the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1883 which investigated this\r\nmiscarriage of justice in the tax cases, he was asked if the man of\r\nwhom he had bought \"peace\" had used the positions he had held in the\r\nproducers' and other associations to further his own ends. He answered:\r\n\"I think he would prostitute anything to further his own mercenary\r\nends.\"[337]\r\n\r\nThe committee of the Legislature appointed to investigate this\r\n\"purchase of peace\" furnishes in its report the facts we have recited,\r\nwhich were uncontradicted, but declares that the transactions they\r\ndisclose \"did not prejudice the rights of the Commonwealth,\" and that\r\nnobody had done anything wrong. An effort was made after the failure\r\nof the tax case to get the Attorney-General of the State to issue a\r\nwarrant against the purchaser of peace, upon which he could have been\r\nheld to trial in a criminal court for bribery and corrupt solicitation\r\nof a public officer. An affidavit charging the crime in the usual\r\nform was presented to the Attorney-General. There was by this time a\r\nnew Attorney-General, but he ditched this move with the same skill\r\nfor the management of his adversaries' case that his predecessor had\r\nexhibited in the tax suit. He demanded that affidavit be made by\r\nsome one who could testify to the bribery of his personal knowledge\r\nbefore the committing magistrate. As the facts were known only to\r\nthe two principals, and neither of them could be expected to come\r\nforward to make affidavit and application for his own commitment, the\r\nAttorney-General demanded the impossible.[338] The fact of bribery was\r\npublicly known by the confession under oath of one of these principals,\r\nand the Attorney-General had been presented with the affidavit of a\r\ncitizen, prepared in due and regular form, upon which he could have\r\nproceeded to issue a warrant, as is done in the case of less powerful\r\noffenders. Failing with the Attorney-General to have this transaction\r\ntaken into the courts, the effort was renewed with the committee\r\nthe Legislature had appointed to investigate. It was asked to do as\r\ncommittees had done before--to send the case to a criminal court and\r\nlet it be tried. The distinguished lawyer acting for the people before\r\nthe committee offered to appear as a volunteer Attorney-General in the\r\nprosecution of the trustee. \"There is not an honest jury,\" he said,\r\n\"in the State of Pennsylvania which upon the testimony would not send\r\nhim to the penitentiary for the crime of bribery.\"[339] The committee\r\nrefused to send the matter to the courts.\r\n\r\nUpon the only occasion when the \"Trustees\" seemed in real danger of\r\nbeing brought in person and on specific charges to trial, criminally,\r\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania saved them. In the Clarion County\r\ncases it took the unprecedented step of interfering with the criminal\r\njurisdiction of the lower courts. It was in reference to this that Mr.\r\nGowen said before the Committee of Commerce of Congress in 1880: \"I\r\nwas a member of the Constitutional Convention of Pennsylvania, and I\r\nknow that if that convention did anything effectively it was when it\r\ndeclared that the Supreme Court should not have original jurisdiction\r\nin criminal cases, and yet I have seen three judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt lay their hands upon an indictment in a county court and hang it\r\nup.\" The effect of this interposition of the Supreme Court is summed up\r\nas follows in the history of the contest between the Producers' Union\r\nand their powerful antagonists: \"This practically terminated the last\r\nlegal proceeding conducted by the general council of the producers of\r\npetroleum.\" \"It was the greatest violation of law,\" said Mr. Gowen\r\nbefore the Pennsylvania Legislative Committee, \"ever committed in the\r\nCommonwealth.\"[340]\r\n\r\nThat some such action might have been expected could be inferred from\r\nthe remark in _Leading Cases Simplified_, by John D. Lawson, warning\r\nthe student of the law of carriers \"not to pay much heed to the\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania--at least, during the\r\npast ten or fifteen years. The Pennsylvania Railroad appears to run\r\nthat tribunal with the same success that it does its own trains.\"[341]\r\n\r\nSome time after these events the purchaser of this peace gave\r\nsome money to a hospital for cancers, and, in recognition of his\r\nphilanthropy, was made its president. This hospital was for cancers of\r\nthe body--not for moral cancers of the kind propagated for money by\r\nmen who corrupt the Commonwealth. It would have been full expiation\r\nin the good old times of the priest and the baron Ruskin describes to\r\ndonate to the cure of an evil a fraction of the profits of the culture\r\nof it. The newspapers in May, 1891, chronicled the opening of another\r\npavilion of this hospital, and the delivery of \"an interesting address\"\r\nby the new president. One of the journals remarks that \"this interest,\r\ncombined with his well-known liberality in Church and humane matters\r\ngenerally, suggests a thought concerning the peculiar development on\r\nthis line of many of our very rich men.\" But what the \"thought\" was the\r\njournalist did not go on to state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\"I WANT TO MAKE OIL\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this writing there is an old man named Samuel Van Syckel, over\r\neighty years of age, partly paralyzed, but still vigorous, living in\r\nan obscure back street of Buffalo, very poor, though his fertile brain\r\nhas helped to make millionaires of many others. Van Syckel's life has\r\nbeen one of ups and downs, possible only in the case of an adventurous\r\nmind seeking the golden-fleece in a new industry and in a new country.\r\nOf all the brave and ingenious men who have experimented, invented,\r\nand pioneered to realize for mankind all the surpassing possibilities\r\nof the coming oil age, he is one of the most notable. He had already\r\nmade and lost one or two fortunes when we find him, about 1860, with a\r\nlittle still in Jersey City, making roof-tar.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, the son of a farmer, and\r\nworked on the farm until he was of age, when he went into business.\r\nThe panic of 1857 caught him with sails wing-a-wing, conducting all\r\nat once, and prosperously, grist-mills, linseed-oil mills, grain\r\ndistilleries--these he had to take for a debt--several stores,\r\ncooper-shops, and two or three farms.\r\n\r\nHe failed because he had gone security for others, but he paid 100\r\ncents on the dollar, and went to New York City. There he became a\r\nmember of the Corn Exchange, and opened a commission-house for the sale\r\nof produce. His country friends had such confidence in his honesty and\r\njudgment that within six months he had done a business of $400,000.\r\nBut he discovered that of the 1500 members of the Exchange all but\r\none had failed, and many of them several times. He saw that he was\r\nin a position where, through the inability of some other dealer to\r\nfulfil his contract, he might be swamped any day, and lose all he had\r\nhimself and all the thousands intrusted to him by his friends. He had\r\nold-fashioned notions about losing friends' money, to himself or to any\r\none else. He left the produce business. He went to making roof-tar in\r\nJersey City, and in 1860 built one of the first refineries for making\r\nkerosene out of petroleum. When \"Colonel\" Drake, in 1859, found out\r\nthat oil could be got by drilling, Van Syckel was one of those the new\r\nsource of supply found waiting for it. He began refining in a small\r\nway, and, with an ardor which he has carried into everything he has\r\ndone, he plunged into the study of new ways of refining the oil which\r\nthen started to flow with embarrassing riches out of thousands of\r\nwells. The study of oil-refining became his passion, as, fortunately\r\nfor us less gifted folk, the study of the effects of heat on clay,\r\nof sulphur on the gum of the caoutchouc-tree, of steam on the lid of\r\nthe teakettle, were in their time passions with Palissy, Goodyear,\r\nand Watts. In the work of his life, forcing its secrets out of this\r\ndifficult liquid, he has been very successful. Earthly reward the\r\nold inventor has none, but, sitting in his story-and-a-half cottage,\r\nwhat he mourns most is that he has been and is denied the opportunity\r\nof work. Tortured by restless and inventive energy, which age and\r\ndisappointment and betrayal have not sufficed to snuff out, his\r\ncontinuous word is: \"I want to make oil.\"\r\n\r\nWhen petroleum from the new wells began to come to New York, dozens\r\nof little stills were built all over the Jersey flats, many of them\r\nby Jews and Greeks. \"Stills kept burning up all around,\" he says to\r\nhis visitor. \"Almost every day there was an explosion somewhere from\r\nthe gases. I told my wife to give me my oldest clothes and send me\r\nmy meals. I was going to find out all about this business. There was\r\na pile of roofing-gravel under a shed by my stills. I went there and\r\nslept and ate, day and night, and watched the stills and the pipes,\r\nthe gases, the oils, and all. All the sleep and rest I had for months\r\nwas there. It was while watching these work that my greatest idea\r\ncame to me, of making oil by a continuous process, so that I could\r\nfeed in petroleum at one end and have kerosene running out at the\r\nother in an unceasing stream, day after day, without stopping the\r\nwhole establishment, as the oil-refineries still do, every day or two,\r\nto cool off and clean up. By the old process, still in use, when the\r\ncharge in the still of perhaps 1000 barrels had been refined, we had to\r\ndraw the fires and wait perhaps ten hours--the best part of a day--for\r\nthe still to cool off, so that the men could go in with iron chisels to\r\nchop it all loose and clean it out. This would take four or five men\r\nfrom four to six hours. The still would be idle for a day and a half,\r\nand then the same process would have to be gone through with again with\r\nevery charge. All over the flats the Jews and Greeks kept burning up.\r\nThe Common Council of Jersey City said we must stop refining. The rest\r\njoined a great combination to fight the Common Council, but I made up\r\nmy mind to go where the oil was produced. I went to Titusville in 1865.\r\nI had all the money I could want. Some rich men told me to draw on them\r\nup to $100,000 for anything there was 'snacks in' for them.\"\r\n\r\nThis was about the time the founders of the oil combination began in\r\nCleveland, with \"no money.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes I found in Titusville!\" continued Van Syckel. \"I went all\r\nup and down the creek. They were glad to get 65 gallons of kerosene\r\nout of 100 gallons of petroleum, while I could get 80. I think the\r\nhead of the oil combination had a little still cocked up in the woods\r\nthere--a one-horse, pig-pen kind of a place at the bend of the creek,\r\na cobbled-up sort of a mud-hole, with a water-trough to bring the\r\noil to the still. He was not there himself; he stayed in Cleveland.\r\nI didn't ever think anything about him then. I was 'way above him. I\r\nfirst saw him some years after, about 1872, in a refiner's office. He\r\nwas talking up some scheme he had for a combination of refineries.\r\nHe said he didn't want to have the market overstocked. He was just a\r\ncommon-looking kind of a man among the rest of us there. I saw, when I\r\nreached Titusville, that the most money was to be made in shipping oil.\r\nI made a dollar a barrel, and in six months I was $100,000 in pocket.\r\nThe land speculation I wouldn't touch. It was wild. It scared me to see\r\nmen sitting around on logs, and trading off little pieces of land for\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars. I was the first man to lay a pipe\r\nline to carry oil up and down the hills of Pennsylvania.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first successful pipe line,\" says the United States Census\r\nReport of 1885, \"was put down by Samuel Van Syckel, of Titusville, in\r\n1865, and extended from Pithole to Miller's Farm, a distance of four\r\nmiles.\"[342]\r\n\r\n\"When I first came to the oil country all the oil had to be teamed from\r\nthe wells to the railways, over roads with no bottom in wet weather.\r\nSometimes a line of teams a mile long would be stuck in the mud. Often\r\nthe teamsters would dump their load, worth $5 a barrel, and abandon\r\nit. Mules would get so discouraged that they would lie down and die\r\nin the roadway before they could be helped. The teamsters knew their\r\npower. They charged accordingly. They charged for looking at the oil\r\nto see how many barrels their teams could draw. They charged extra for\r\nevery mud-hole they struck, and if the wagon-wheels went to the hubs\r\nthey doubled their bills. I paid $2 to $4 a barrel for teaming, and\r\nwas shipping 4000 barrels a week. The teamsters were making more money\r\nthan the well-owners, and didn't care whether they hauled oil or not.\r\nAll this set me to thinking. I hit on the pipe line idea, and announced\r\nthat I would carry the oil by pipe from the wells to the railroad. That\r\nwas too much for the people of the oil regions. Everybody laughed me\r\ndown. Even my particular friends, with whom I used to take my meals\r\nat the hotel, jeered and gibed me so that I took to coming and going\r\nthrough the back door and through the kitchen, and ate by myself. 'Do\r\nyou expect to put a girdle around the earth?' was the favorite sarcasm.\r\nI knew it would cost a great deal--$100,000 perhaps; but I had the\r\nmoney. I built it--two two-inch lines, side by side--between June and\r\nNovember in 1865, and turned the oil in. The pipe was a perfect success\r\nfrom the first barrel of oil that was pumped in. It flowed, just as I\r\nexpected, up hill and down dale. The line was four miles long--from the\r\nMiller Farm to Pithole--with two or three branches.\r\n\r\n\"Then the teamsters threatened to kill any one who worked on the pipe\r\nline or who used it. They would drive astraddle of it, dig down to it,\r\nput logging chains around it and pull it out of the ground, and leave\r\nthe oil, worth $4 to $5 a barrel, running to waste out of the holes. I\r\nsent to New York for some carbines, hired 25 men to patrol the line,\r\nand put a stop to that. I put up the line as security for some debts\r\nowed by my partner, under an agreement that when its profits had paid\r\nthe debt it was to be returned to me. The debt was wiped out in a few\r\nmonths, but I never got the line back.... I had no money left to sue\r\nfor it. This was the end of my pipe line. It has grown into a system\r\nthousands of miles long, second in importance only to the railroad,\r\nand out of it many, many millions of profit have been made, but not\r\na cent has it yielded me. Then I went to refining oil, and, with a\r\npartner, built one of the first big refineries in the oil regions.\r\nThere has been no oil refined in this country since 1870 without the\r\nhelp of my improvements. Some I patented, some I did not. The refiners\r\nat Titusville were hard put to it for pure water. I drove pipes through\r\nthe river into the second gravel under the river, and got the finest\r\ncold water there could be. This anticipated the 'driven wells' several\r\nyears. I put steam into the stills\" (this had been done before both\r\nby European and American refiners). \"I found out how to burn the\r\nuncondensable gases. I showed one of my neighbors how to do this, and\r\nhe saved $20 a day after that in his coal bills, but I got nothing for\r\nit. Each new thing I proposed, up would go everybody's hands and eyes,\r\nand oh, what a rumbling there would be! I never made money so fast as\r\nin this refinery. We did not use the continuous process. I had not\r\npatented it, and I had partners whom it would not have been right for\r\nme to experiment with. Our profits were over a dollar on every barrel.\r\nWe sold our product as fast as we could make it. We made $125,000 in\r\nfifteen months, although we paid as high as $8 a barrel for crude. I\r\nworked like a slave to make good the loss of $100,000 in my pipe line.\r\nI worked and watched day and night, and knew I was beating them all\r\nmaking oil. My partners were church elders, who could never find words\r\nenough to express their indignation about the way my pipe line had been\r\ntaken away from me, and so virtuous that they never smoked a cigar nor\r\ndrank a drop. I got into no end of lawsuits with them, and I lost my\r\nproperty again. I sold a part interest in my patent to some one who was\r\nafterwards taken into this oil combination, and it now claims that they\r\nown all my patents. They have frightened off or bought off every one\r\nwho has tried to use any of my inventions.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the old man's story was told by him under oath in a suit\r\nhe brought against members of the combination.[343] \"The idea of\r\ncontinuous distillation, as it was suggested to me at Jersey City, was\r\nalways in my brain ever since. I made an attempt to construct such\r\nworks in 1876 under Mr. Cary. I run out of money. I had been robbed out\r\nof my pipe line that cost me $100,000, and my oil-refinery in which I\r\nhad more than $100,000. Mr. Cary said he was going to build a little\r\nrefinery. He said he had $10,000 that we might use in making oil in a\r\ncontinuous way. We got our lease and broke ground in 1876. We had not\r\ngot very far--we got the pipe on the ground and some brick and one\r\nold-fashioned still--when\" the representative of the oil combination,\r\none of its principal members, \"came on to the ground ... the 15th\r\nof December, 1876. He asked me if I would not take a salary and not\r\nbuild these works in opposition to them. I told him 'No.' Then he\r\nwanted I should take a life salary, one that would support me for life\r\ncomfortably. I told him I did not want his salary; I wanted to build\r\nthis refinery and make oil in a new continuous way. He then wanted me\r\nto let him build it. He said, 'We will build it for you.' I objected\r\nto this. He then said that I could make no money if I did refine oil.\r\nHe also said if I did I could not ship it. He said he would say to me\r\nconfidentially that they had made such arrangements with the railroads\r\nin reference to freight--in reference to getting cars--he knew I could\r\nmake no money if I did make oil.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost on the same day--May 14, 1888--on which Van Syckel was giving\r\nthe jury this undisputed account, sustained by the judge and jury, of\r\nhow the combination used \"arrangements with the railroads\" against\r\nits rivals, another pioneer, even more distinguished, was relating\r\nhis almost identical experience before the committee of Congress\r\ninvestigating trusts, May 3, 1888. This was Joshua Merrill, \"to whom,\"\r\nsaid S. Dana Hayes, State Chemist of Massachusetts, \"more than to any\r\none else, belongs the honor of bringing this manufacture to its present\r\nadvanced state.\"[344] Merrill's inventions and successful labors are\r\ndescribed in the United States Census Report on Petroleum, 1885. He was\r\nat work guessing the riddles of petroleum as long ago as 1854.[345]\r\n\r\nFrom 1866 to 1888 he and his partners ran a refinery at Boston.\r\n\r\n\"What has become of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have recently dismantled it.\"[346]\r\n\r\nFor several years their business had been unprofitable. There were two\r\ncauses, he explained. One was that they made a better quality of oil\r\nthan the average, at a cost which they could not recoup from the prices\r\nestablished in the market by poorer oils. The other cause was the\r\nextraordinary charges made against his firm by the railways in Boston\r\nwhich brought their crude.\r\n\r\nHis firm had their own tank-cars, in which their crude oil came from\r\nPennsylvania. From Olean to Boston his freight cost him the last few\r\nyears 50 cents a barrel. From the depot in Boston, to get it over two\r\nmiles of track to his refinery, cost him $10 a car, or about $1.25 a\r\nbarrel. This was at the rate of about 42-1/2 cents a ton a mile. The\r\naverage freight rate for the United States is about half a cent a ton\r\na mile. His rate was an advance of 8400 per cent. on the average. He\r\nappealed to the Railroad Commission of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\"We wrote to the commissioners that we thought the charge was very\r\nhigh, and they ought to interfere to have it reduced. But it was not\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"We made repeated efforts, personal solicitations, to the railroad\r\nofficers, and to the railroad commissioners also, but it was the\r\nestablished rate.\"[347]\r\n\r\nTwo roads participated in this charge of $10 for hauling a car two\r\nmiles. One of these was the New York and New England road, whose haul\r\nwas a mile and a half, and its charge $6.\r\n\r\n\"Who was president of the New York and New England road?\"\r\n\r\nThe dismantled witness's experience had made him timid.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not know,\" he was asked, \"that one of the oil trustees is\r\npresident?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"[348]\r\n\r\nThe same railroad is the principal New England link in the lines of\r\ncircumvallation which the combination in coal, hard and soft, American\r\nand Nova Scotian, is drawing about the homes and industries of the\r\ncountry. His company sold their tank-cars to the oil combination, as\r\n\"we no longer had any use for them.\"[349]\r\n\r\n\"I was thirty-two years in the oil business,\" the veteran said,\r\nmournfully, as he left the stand. \"It was the business of my life.\"[350]\r\n\r\nTo return to Van Syckel. After his warning to the inventor that he\r\ncould get no cars and make no money, even if his new idea proved a\r\nsuccess, the representative of the combination invited Van Syckel to\r\nput himself in its hands.\r\n\r\n\"He said they would furnish the money to test the invention and pay me\r\nall it was worth. I felt a little startled at the rebates, and I knew\r\nit before, but I did not know it was so bad as he had figured it out.\r\nI then asked him who of his company would agree to furnish me money to\r\ntest the patent and to pay all it was worth. He asked me who I wanted\r\nto agree with. I then asked him if a man\" (naming him) \"that I had had\r\nmore or less dealings with\" (one of the trustees) \"would agree to what\r\nhe had said. He said he had no doubt he would. He said, 'We will go and\r\nsee him, and go at his expense.' He said he would take the works off my\r\nhands at cost, and would satisfy my partner to stop building them if I\r\nwould go to New York, and I think it was the next day when we went to\r\nNew York.\"\r\n\r\nThey went to the office of the member of the combination whom Van\r\nSyckel had said he would confide in. \"He seemed to be very glad to\r\nsee me, and very sorry to learn I had been so unfortunate in the oil\r\nregions. He then asked me what these patent works would cost in a small\r\nway to prove that oil could be successfully made under continuous\r\ndistillation. I told him it could be done for about $10,000. He said\r\nthey would give it, ... and if it proved a success they would give me\r\n$100,000. He said it was worth more. He would give me $125 a month to\r\nsupport my family during the time I was building and testing it. I\r\nsaid, 'Let us put what we have agreed upon in writing.' He begged off\r\nfor a time. He said it could be done at Titusville just as well. He saw\r\nI was not quite satisfied being cut off in that way, so he took my hand\r\nand said he would give me his word and honor what they had agreed upon\r\nthere should be put in writing at Titusville Monday morning. I did not\r\nwant to press him any harder. I told him I would take the $125 a month\r\nuntil the thing was tested. If it proved a failure the whole thing\r\nshould come back where it started from, and if it proved a success he\r\nwas to pay me $100,000\" (for the patents and the business). \"He said\r\nwe all understood it, then. I went home.\" Van Syckel called upon the\r\nTitusville member of the trust. \"He begged off from me the same as the\r\nother did in New York; said they were pressed with business. He said\r\nthey would fix it this afternoon, or words to that effect.\" Instead\r\nof building for him, as it had agreed, the combination, the moment he\r\nplaced himself in its hands, destroyed the building he had already\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\n\"What did they do with the works when they bought them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They took the brick that was on the cars and hauled them to other\r\nplaces, I suppose, and I don't know where they threw the still. They\r\nkept that leased property during the five years for a junk-yard. I went\r\nthe next day to see him, and pressed him about it the best I could.\r\nI could not accomplish anything; he appeared to be busy, or kept out\r\nof the way. I kept chasing to his office. I tried to catch him and\r\ntalk over what I should depend on, where we were going to build; but\r\nhe kept out of the way. He said he had not seen their folks. In July,\r\n1879, more than three years after our contract in New York, he said\r\nthey had had a meeting of all their wise-heads, and they had called in\r\nchemists, and they all unanimously agreed that oil could not be made\r\nby a continuous process, and gave that as a reason for not furnishing\r\nthe money to build these works. I said, in reply, 'I am not responsible\r\nfor the knowledge that the \"oil combination\" has for refining oil;\r\nneither would I exchange mine for all they have got combined. You said\r\nyou would furnish me the money and build these works, and do as you had\r\nagreed to do.' I walked out. That was about the last I had to say to\r\nhim on that subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you after that build, or undertake to build, an oil refinery to\r\ntest your continuous process?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; in connection with a German. He was going to build a small\r\nrefinery. He said he would build it my way, if I would let him use\r\nit in the new way. He constructed it on that principle; but he was\r\nslow--he was a very slow man to deal with. We ran ... twenty days\r\nwithout stopping\" (to clean out the stills).\r\n\r\n\"And it actually ran that length of time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What became of these works?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hauled off to the junk-yard\"--by one of the companies in the\r\ncombination. It \"bought them out after we just got them under way, and\r\nthen tore them down and hauled them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"You then brought them up to Buffalo, and tried to put them into the\r\nSolar Works?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What became of those?\"\r\n\r\n\"They eventually went the same way.\"\r\n\r\nIn court the combination claimed that Van Syckel's was an inferior\r\nprocess, but it had not left it to die the natural death of the\r\ninferior process.\r\n\r\n\"And how about the expense of the two ways?\" he was asked.\r\n\r\n\"The same help that would make 1000 barrels the old way, to take three\r\nor four days, I would make in the new process in one day; the old way\r\ntakes about a ton of coal more and gets less oil, and the oil is not\r\nnear so good.\"\r\n\r\nNo contradiction was offered by the defendants of any of these\r\nstatements. Uncontradicted evidence showed that the new process was\r\ncheaper and produced better oil than the old processes. Stillmen from\r\nthe Herman and Solar refineries, in which Van Syckel tried his new\r\nprocess after the combination refused to build for him, testified to\r\nthe practical success of his method. \"We must have run these continuous\r\nworks for two months while I was there\" (at the Solar).[351]\r\n\r\n\"We kept Van Syckel's process running right along continuously for\r\nsixteen days\" (at the Herman refinery).[352]\r\n\r\n\"We did not have to clean out the patent stills, while by the old\r\nprocess they would have to be cleaned out about every day or thirty-six\r\nhours.\"[353]\r\n\r\nA number of residents of Titusville, dealers in oil and consumers,\r\ntestified to the superiority of the illuminant Van Syckel produced.\r\nIt burned much better than that made by the monopoly, several said.\r\n\"The burning qualities was extraordinarily good.\" \"It gave better\r\nsatisfaction to my customers.\" \"It did not gum the lamp-wicks, and did\r\nnot smell.\"[354]\r\n\r\nThis was done in spite of rusty and choked-up pipes, defective stills\r\nand apparatus.\r\n\r\nOne of the owners of the Solar, who was a practical refiner and\r\nthe overseer of the works, testified that he had seen Van Syckel's\r\ncontinuous process run successfully both in Titusville and Buffalo:\r\n\r\n\"The result was much beyond my expectation.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long did you run the works?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think about two weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the cause of it stopping?\"\r\n\r\n\"The president of the company, also the treasurer, had been to New\r\nYork two or three times; after the second or third visit he came back\r\nseemingly disgusted with the business; afraid of losing his money if he\r\ncontinued any longer, and quit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there a mortgage upon your property?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" It had been foreclosed, he said, in conclusion, by one of\r\nthe leading members of the oil combination.[355]\r\n\r\nThe only thing Van Syckel can do to carry out his part of the contract\r\nhe does. He develops his invention. He is successful in his application\r\nto the United States patent-office. He made his contract with the\r\ncombination in 1876, and got four patents thereafter in 1877, 1878, and\r\n1879.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" it was said in court, \"they are a large concern; they would\r\nmake money out of this; I should think they would want it if it is\r\nsuch a good thing.\" \"Why, my dear man, they have got a monopoly of the\r\nbusiness, anyway,\" Van Syckel replied. \"They don't care what kind of\r\noil they sell; but they have got a plant that has cost them millions\r\nof dollars that they have got to change, and all that sort of thing, if\r\nthey take my patent. That is the situation.\"\r\n\r\nHe lived on the $125 a month while he was testing and proving the\r\ninvention. In July, 1880, when four years of his life had been thus\r\nwasted, the allowance was changed, without notice or his consent, to\r\n$75 a month. The next month he was refused even that sum \"unless I\r\nsigned a receipt in full of all demands, and I walked out without it.\"\r\n\r\nHis pipe line has become a part of the net-work of pipe lines of which\r\nthe oil combination boasts. His refinery of 1869, one of the largest\r\nbuilt in western Pennsylvania up to that time, passed into its hands.\r\nThree times in succession, after it refuses to build for him as it\r\nagreed, he arranges to put his idea of continuous distillation into\r\nuse, and in each case the refinery in which he sets up his pipes and\r\nstills is bought up by it and destroyed. He is kept dangling for years\r\nby its policy of delay. Then his independent efforts are broken up;\r\ncapitalists are made afraid of him. He can get no means for building\r\nnew works. \"Ever since I went into their hands,\" he said in court, \"I\r\nhave been just as I am now. I could not make oil; could not build a\r\nrefinery; could not get anybody help me to do it; and here I have stood\r\nthese last twelve years, and I want to be out. That is just where they\r\nwant to keep me, so I cannot make any oil. It is the whole profit of\r\nthe whole of it. They hold me to my contract, and they break theirs.\"\r\n\r\nWhen twelve years had gone by, and he found that they would neither\r\nbuild for him as agreed nor let any one else build for him, Van Syckel\r\nturned to the law and sued them for damages. On the trial all the facts\r\nas we have stated were admitted--the abandonment of the enterprise in\r\nconsequence of the threats that he would not be allowed to ship and\r\nmarket his oil; the interviews in New York; the contract; the sale; Van\r\nSyckel's later efforts to make oil in other refineries; his success\r\nin producing better and cheaper oil; its popularity; the purchase and\r\ndestruction of the works using the new method. Not a word of evidence\r\nwas adduced in disproof. The judge and the jury found all these\r\nquestions in Van Syckel's favor.\r\n\r\nThe defence was twofold. It was admitted that the two representatives\r\nVan Syckel had dealt with had made the contract as he described it. The\r\nmembers of the combination did not deny that. But, they argued, it was\r\nnot legally binding. \"We simply concede,\" said these great men to the\r\nCourt, \"that they made a contract, but leaving it to the corporation\r\nitself to decide upon it.... There cannot be the slightest claim that\r\nthe company was bound by a contract of that character.\" On this point\r\nthey were defeated in the trial. Their second defence was that there\r\nwere no damages. \"The trouble is,\" they said, \"that there are no\r\ndamages sustained, no damages whatever sustained.\" They took the ground\r\nthat his possessing a creative mind was the cause of Van Syckel's ruin,\r\nnot their betrayal of him. \"Mr. Van Syckel,\" they argued to the Court,\r\nsympathetically, \"is an instance of what it means to get out a patent,\r\nand deal in patents--in nine cases out of ten. He was an inventive man.\r\nHe has got out a good many patents. No question they were meritorious\r\npatents. And what is the result? Poverty, a broken heart, an enfeebled\r\nintellect, and a struggle now for the means of subsistence by this\r\nlawsuit. So that, if your honor please, there is nothing here from\r\nwhich we can determine what the original value of this patent was.\" The\r\njury and the judge decided against them, and held there was a contract,\r\nlegal and binding. That brought them face to face with the question of\r\ndamages, and here the ruling of the judge saved them, as the decision\r\nof another judge saved other members of the combination in the criminal\r\ncase in the same city, about the same time.[356] The judge ordered the\r\njury to find the damages at six cents, and the jury--in the evolution\r\nof freedom juries appear to have become merely clerks of the Court--did\r\nso. \"This direction of a verdict,\" said the Court to Van Syckel,\r\n\"decides every other question of the case in your favor.\"\r\n\r\nSix cents damages for breach of such a contract, and in Buffalo $250\r\nfine for conspiracy to blow up a rival refinery! Here are figures with\r\nwhich to begin a judicial price-list of the cost of immunity for crimes\r\nand wrongs.\r\n\r\nLawyer Moot, Van Syckel's counsel, deferentially asked the Court to\r\nsuggest where was the defect in the proof of damages. It would be \"the\r\nwildest speculation and guesswork,\" the Court said, for the jury to\r\nattempt to compute the damages.\r\n\r\n\"Then the Court is unable to suggest any particular defect in the\r\nproof?\"\r\n\r\nThe Court evaded the point of the counsel, and repeated in general\r\nterms that there was no testimony upon which a jury could assess\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\nThose whom he was suing did not disprove that, by threats of making it\r\nimpossible for him to get transportation, they had driven Van Syckel\r\nto abandon his own business, and make a contract with them by which\r\nthey were to pay him $100,000 for his new process, if successful. The\r\nCourt held the contract binding. They had not furnished the money and\r\nworks to test the inventions as they had agreed to do; but he had\r\nnevertheless gone on and completed the invention, so that patents\r\nwere granted for it by the government. He had tested the invention in\r\nother works, they failing him, and had proved it a success; they had\r\nthereupon purchased and destroyed these works; he was beggared, and\r\nnobody else under these circumstances could be induced to venture money\r\non his invention. Upon these facts, judicially ascertained, the judge\r\nrefused to let the jury compute the damages, and ordered them to find\r\nthe damages \"nominal,\" as another judge sentenced their associates in\r\nBuffalo to \"nominal\" punishment.\r\n\r\n\"There are many things known to the law,\" said Parnell to the president\r\nof the Special Commission trying the Irish members of Parliament,\r\n\"which are strange to a non-legal mind.\"\r\n\r\nThis pioneer, inventor, and true Captain of Industry, real creator of\r\nwealth, has ever since had his neck bent to the pressure of hands too\r\nheavy for him. While all over the earth homes are brighter, knowledge\r\nis more easily got, and civilization forwarded, because of what his\r\nhead has thought and his hands have done, he has retired to what is,\r\nin fact, a life of penal exile. He has been cut off from the darlings\r\nof his brain. Like the political prisoners of Siberia, he can eat\r\nand sleep and dress, but he cannot go into the world. His mind is at\r\nwork there, in every factory and pipe line and lamp; but he must sit,\r\nunknown and unrewarded, in his pine cottage on unpaved Maurice Street,\r\nploughed up in the prairies on the outskirts of Buffalo. Dearer than\r\nmoney to him, as to all such creative minds, would be the privilege\r\nof feeding the appealing activities of his brain with work. But he\r\nis banished from work. He has been set down outside the frontier of\r\nindustry, and commanded never to return. No one dares buy or sell of\r\nhim, nor adventure labor or money with him. He is an outcast. This is\r\nhis greatest grief. The day I visited him he came into the sitting-room\r\nfrom the patch of garden behind the house. \"I keep busy,\" he said,\r\n\"to keep my mind off--anything to keep busy, if it is only pulling\r\nweeds.\" He is glad to see visitors. \"I have been knocked out,\" he\r\nsaid, \"so that nobody now comes to see me.\" His clear gray-blue eyes,\r\ntall, strong frame, firm mouth, large features and limbs, eager face,\r\nfit the facts of his career. He is one of the type of country-bred,\r\nhard-working American manhood of the last generation. There are\r\nno visionary lines in his face, as in his life there have been no\r\nimpracticabilities, except his too great trustfulness. Gambling oil\r\nexchanges, wild oil-land speculations, inside \"deals\" with railroad\r\nfreight agents, have never caught him. He has been a money-maker--not\r\na money-taker. To-day, at eighty, the only thing he asks is that he\r\nmay have the chance to work out his ideas. He talks patiently and\r\ncourteously, with perfect intelligence and memory, but every once in\r\na while breaks in with an outburst of what is evidently an unceasing\r\nrefrain within--\"I want to make oil.\"\r\n\r\nThe diminutive room we are in is stark in its simplicity and poverty. A\r\nparagraph in the morning paper on the table tells of \"a massive oaken\r\ncase, similar to a bookcase,\" which one of the chief reapers where\r\nVan Syckel has sowed is having put into his stable in New York. \"It\r\nhas doors of polished oak, with brass hinges, and heavy plate-glass.\r\nThe inside will be lined with purple plush, and, when completed, the\r\nbits which shine in the mouths of his trotters and coach-horses will\r\nbe arranged inside of this magnificent case in rows, ready for use, as\r\nwell as an appropriate ornament for the stable.\"\r\n\r\nIt is better to be one of the king's horses than one of the king's\r\nmen. But no words of envy pass his lips. He does not seem to repress\r\nthem. He simply appears never to feel them. It chanced that as I\r\nleft him, standing on the uppermost of the three wooden steps of his\r\ncottage, bleakness all about, \"plain living\" within, plain enough to\r\nsatisfy the hardest climber for \"high thinking,\" it chanced that his\r\nlast words to me were--\"I want to make oil,\" with an appeal to seek\r\nfor him the opportunity so long denied. These words, plain and homely\r\nas they must seem to those who feed their appetite for the sublime\r\nand heroic with the highly varnished sayings of the battle-field and\r\nillustrious death-beds, will never cease to ring in my ears with a tone\r\nof greatness.[357]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSYMPATHETICAL CO-OPERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nSome day, perhaps, when more of our story-readers have learned that\r\nthere are things in the world quite as important as the frets, follies,\r\nand loves of boys and girls half-grown, more of our story-tellers will\r\nhold their magic mirror up to the full-pulsed life with which mankind\r\nthrobs through the laboring years that stretch along after the short\r\nfever of mating is over. George Rice, coming from the Green Mountains\r\nof Vermont, entered the oil business twenty-nine years ago, when he and\r\nit were young. He was one of the first comers. Beginning as a producer\r\nin the Pithole region, in the days of its evanescent glory, in 1865,\r\nhe prospered. Escaping the ruin which overtook those who stayed too\r\nlong in that too quick sand, he was one of the first to develop the new\r\nfield at Macksburg, Ohio, and to see the advantages of Marietta, on the\r\nOhio River, as a point for refining. Crude oil could easily be brought\r\nfrom Ohio and Pennsylvania by barge down the Ohio River. The field he\r\nentered was unoccupied. He drove no one out, but built a new industry\r\nin a new place. In 1876 he had risen to the dignity of manufacturer,\r\nand had a refinery of a capacity of 500 barrels a week, and later of\r\n2000 barrels. Owning wells, he produced, himself, a part of the crude\r\nwhich he refined. His position gave him access to all the markets by\r\nriver and rail. Everything promised him fortune. His family took hold\r\nwith him in the work of bread-winning. \"The executive part of the\r\nbusiness is done altogether by my family,\" he says. \"One daughter keeps\r\nthe books, another daughter does nine-tenths of the correspondence, and\r\nmy son-in-law is the general manager.\"[358] One of the daughters was\r\na witness in one of her father's cases before the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission. \"She discussed with counsel,\" said the New York _World_,\r\n\"the knotty points involving tank-car rates, mileage, rebates, and the\r\nlong and short haul as familiarly as any general freight agent present.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral other refiners, seeing the advantages of Marietta, had settled\r\nthere. They who elected themselves to be trustees of the light of the\r\nworld, thus having the advantages of the place pointed out to them by\r\npractical men, determined that Marietta must be theirs. They bought up\r\nsome of the refiners. Then they stopped buying. Their representative\r\nthere, afterwards a member of the trust, \"told me distinctly that\r\nhe had bought certain refineries in Marietta, but that he would not\r\nbuy any more.... He had another way,\" he said, \"of getting rid of\r\nthem.\"[359] Of these \"other ways\" the independents were now to have a\r\nfull exposition. In January, 1879, freight rates on oil were suddenly\r\nand without previous notice raised by the railroads leading out of\r\nMarietta, and by their connections. Some of the rates were doubled. The\r\nincrease was only on oil. It was--in Ohio--only on oil shipped from\r\nMarietta; it was exacted only from the few refiners who had not been\r\nbought, because there were \"other ways of getting rid of them.\"[360]\r\n\r\nThis freight-tariff attack on the independent refiners was arranged by\r\ntheir powerful rival and the railroad managers at a secret conference,\r\nas the latter admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Did you have any consultation or invite consultation with other\r\nmanufacturers of oil at Marietta?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"[361]\r\n\r\nWhen the representatives of the combination in this market were taxed\r\nby a dealer with getting the benefit of this manipulation of freight,\r\n\"they laughed.\" All the railroads took part in the surprise. Curiously\r\nenough, the minds of the managers of a dozen roads acted simultaneously\r\nand identically, over thousands of miles of country--some, as they\r\nadmitted, with suggestion, and some, as they testified, without\r\nsuggestion--upon so precise a detail of their business as the rates\r\non oil at one little point. \"I did it at my own instance,\" said the\r\nfreight agent of the Baltimore and Ohio. Freight officials of railways\r\nas far apart east, west, and south, and in interest, as the Baltimore\r\nand Ohio, and the Pennsylvania, and the Lake Shore, which had no direct\r\nconnection with Marietta, and reached it only over other lines, stopped\r\ntheir \"wars\" to play their part in the move by raising the rate on oil\r\nonly, and, most remarkable of all, to a figure at which neither they,\r\nnor the railroad connecting them with Marietta, nor (and this was the\r\ngame they were gunning for) the independent refiners could do any\r\nbusiness. From other points than Marietta, as Cleveland, Parkersburg,\r\nPittsburg, and Wheeling, where the combination had refineries, but the\r\nMarietta independents had none, the railroads left the former rates\r\nunchanged.[362]\r\n\r\nRice was \"got rid of\" at Columbus just as effectually as if Ruskin's\r\n\"Money-bag Baron,\" successor of \"the Crag Baron,\" stood across the road\r\nwith a blunderbuss. His successful rival had but to let its Marietta\r\nrefineries lie idle, and transfer to its refineries at Wheeling its\r\nMarietta business--and Rice's too. By the pooling of the earnings\r\nand of the control of all its refineries--the essential features of\r\nthe combination--its business could be transferred from one point\r\nto another without loss. One locality or another could be subjected\r\nto ruinous conditions for the extermination of competitors, and the\r\ncombination, no matter how large its works there, would prosper without\r\ncheck. It gets the same profit as before, but the competitor by its\r\nside is ruined. All its refineries along a given railroad can be closed\r\nby high rates made to \"overcome competition,\" but profits do not cease.\r\nTheir business is done elsewhere by its other refineries, and all the\r\nprofits go into a pool for the common benefit.\r\n\r\nFrom Rice's point of view, Marietta was the storm-centre; but the\r\nevidence before the Ohio Legislative Investigation of 1879, before the\r\nLegislative Committee of New York of 1879, before Master in Chancery\r\nSweitzer in Pennsylvania, and in the suit against the Lake Shore\r\nRailroad, showed that the low barometer there was part of a disturbance\r\ncovering a wide area. The demonstration against the independent\r\nrefiners of Marietta was only part of a wider web-spinning, in which\r\nthose at all points--New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Oil\r\nCity, Titusville, Buffalo, Rochester,[363] and Cleveland--were to be\r\nforced to \"come in\" as dependents, or sell out, as most of them did.\r\n\r\nThat rates were not raised from points controlled by the combination\r\nis only part of the truth. At such places rates were lowered. This,\r\nlike the increase of rates, was done at a secret conference with the\r\noil combination and at its instance.[364] Where it had refineries the\r\nrates were to be low; the high rates were for points where it had\r\ncompetitors to be got rid of without the expense of buying them up. The\r\nindependents knew nothing of the increase of freights prepared for them\r\nby the railroad managers and their great competitor until after, some\r\ntime after, it had gone into effect.\r\n\r\nThe railroad company gave notice to their rivals what the rates were\r\nto be, but withheld that information from them.[365] That was not all.\r\nBefore the new rates were given all the old rates were cancelled. \"For\r\na few days,\" said an independent, \"we could not obtain any rates at\r\nall. We had orders from our customers, but could not obtain any rates\r\nof freight.\"\r\n\r\nAs to many places, the withholding of rates continued. \"There's many\r\nplaces we can't obtain any rates to. They just say we sha'n't ship to\r\nthese other places at any price.\"[366]\r\n\r\nWhen the Ohio Legislature undertook to investigate, it found that the\r\nrailroad men professed a higher allegiance to their corporations than\r\nto the State. They refused to answer the questions of the committee,\r\nor evaded them. \"I am working under orders from the general freight\r\nagent,\" said one of them, \"and I don't feel authorized to answer that.\"\r\nThe arguments of the committee that the orders of an employer could not\r\nsupersede the duty of a citizen to his government, or the obligations\r\nof his oath as a witness, were wasted. \"I will tell you just how I\r\nfeel,\" said the witness to these representatives of an inferior power.\r\n\"I am connected with the railroad company, and get my instructions from\r\nthe general agent, and I am very careful about telling anybody else\r\nanything.\" The Legislature accepted the rank of \"anybody else\" to which\r\nit was assigned, and did not compel the witness to answer.\r\n\r\nTo a question about the increase in freight: \"I object,\" said another\r\nrailroad officer, \"to going into details about my own private\r\nbusiness.\"[367]\r\n\r\nOne peculiar thing about the action of the railroads was that it was an\r\ninjury to themselves. The Baltimore and Ohio, for instance, by raising\r\nits rate, cut off its oil business with Marietta entirely. \"What\r\nadvantage is it, then?\" the freight agent of the road over which the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio reached Marietta was asked.\r\n\r\n\"There is no advantage.... We had revenue before this increase in\r\nrates, and none since.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would be the inducement for her (the Baltimore and Ohio) to do\r\nit, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a matter I am not competent to answer.\"[368]\r\n\r\nThe railroad men testified positively that the increase affected all\r\nalike at Marietta. It was supposed even by those who thought they saw\r\nto the bottom of the manoeuvre that the combination would close its\r\nMarietta works temporarily, in order to seem to be equally affected\r\nwith all the rest. It could do this with no loss whatever, since, as\r\nexplained, no raise in rates had been made from Wheeling, Parkersburg,\r\nPittsburg, Cleveland, where it was practically alone, and it could\r\nreach all its customers from those places as well as from Marietta. But\r\nthe combination kept on filling orders from its refineries at Marietta\r\nat the old freight rates, while by its side the men it was hunting down\r\nsat idle because the discriminating rates of freight made it impossible\r\nfor them to use the highways. It was so careless of appearances\r\nthat oil ordered of its works at Parkersburg would be sent from the\r\nMarietta branch,[369] and at the old rate of 40 cents, while the other\r\nrefineries could not ship because the rate to them was 65 cents; the\r\nincrease at Marietta was not enforced against it, but only against the\r\nthree independents--just as planned in the South Improvement scheme.\r\n\r\nThe move was far-reaching--as far as Chicago, the rate to which was\r\nmade $1.20 a barrel, instead of 90 cents a barrel.\r\n\r\n\"Then they cut you off from the Western trade as well as this State?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; almost entirely.... I was selling in Chicago, and it cut\r\ntrade entirely off.\"[370]\r\n\r\n\"Before the rates were changed did you run to your full capacity?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; about that.\"[371]\r\n\r\nAt one stroke the independents lost the business which it had cost them\r\nyears of work to get. As the testimony of witness after witness showed,\r\nthe merchants who had been their customers in Chicago, Columbus, and\r\nother places, now had to send their orders to those for whose benefit\r\nthe railroad men had raised the rates. This sweeping change was not due\r\nto any change in their desire to sell, or of their old customers to\r\nbuy. They could still make oil which was still wanted. But they were\r\nthe victims of a competitor who had learned the secret of a more royal\r\nroad to business supremacy than making a better thing, or selling it\r\nat a better price. Their better way was not to excel but to exclude.\r\nWhen their \"secretary\" was called before the Ohio Legislature, after\r\nthis freight ambuscade had transferred the bulk of the business of\r\nthe independent refineries at Marietta to him and his associates, he\r\ndeclared that the sole cause of their success was the \"large mechanical\r\ncontrivances\" of the combination, its \"economy,\" and its production of\r\nthe \"very best oil.\" \"With an aggregation of capital, and a business\r\nexperience, and a hold upon the channels of trade such as we have, it\r\nis idle to say that the small manufacturer can compete with us; and\r\nalthough that is an offensive term, 'squeezing out,' yet it has never\r\nbeen done by the conjunction of any railroads with us.\"[372]\r\n\r\nThe small manufacturer did compete and flourish until these railroad\r\nmen literally switched him out of the market. He competed and got his\r\nshare of the business, until the men who wanted monopoly, finding that\r\nthey had no monopoly of quality or price or business ability, resorted\r\nto the \"large mechanical contrivance\" of inducing the managers of\r\nthe railroads to derail the independent, throwing him off the track\r\nby piling impassable freight tariffs in his way. The successful men\r\nsecured their supremacy by preventing their competitors from entering\r\nthe market at all. Instead of winning by \"better\" and \"cheaper,\" they\r\nwon by preventing any competitor from coming forward to test the\r\nquestions of \"better\" and \"cheaper.\" Their method of demonstrating\r\nsuperiority has been to prevent comparisons.\r\n\r\nAll the independent refiners at Marietta, except Rice, died. \"Most of\r\nthose we received from have gone out of the business,\" a Cincinnati\r\ndealer told the Legislature. Some had fled; some had sold out.[373]\r\nRice set himself to do two things: the first, to drag into the light\r\nof day and the public view the secrets of these \"better methods\"; and\r\nthe second, to get new business in the place of what he had lost. He\r\nsucceeded in both. It was in January that he had notice served upon him\r\nthat he could no longer go to market. In two months he had the Ohio\r\nLegislature at work investigating this extraordinary administration of\r\nthe highways. This was a great public service. It did not yield the\r\nfruit of immediate reform, but it did work which is the indispensable\r\npreliminary. It roused the people who were still asleep on these new\r\nissues, and were dreaming pleasant dreams that in George III. they had\r\nescaped from all tyrants forever, and that in the emancipation of the\r\nblacks they had freed all slaves forever.\r\n\r\nRice knew that the Legislature were planting trees for posterity, and\r\ndid not wait for help from them. He set about looking up markets where\r\nthe public were free to choose and buy. He could not go West or East or\r\nNorth. He went South. The little family kept the refinery at Marietta\r\nrunning, and the father travelled about establishing new agencies in\r\nthe South, and studying freight tariffs, railroad routes, and terminal\r\nfacilities for loading and unloading and storing. In 1880, through all\r\nthe storm and stress of these days, he was able to double the capacity\r\nof his refinery. Again he succeeded in building up a livelihood, and\r\nagain his success was treated as trespass and invasion. His bitter\r\nexperience in Ohio in 1879 proved to be but an apprenticeship for a\r\nstill sterner struggle. Rice was getting most of his crude oil from\r\nPennsylvania, through a little pipe line which brought it to the\r\nAlleghany. The pipe line was taken up by the oil trust.[374]\r\n\r\nThis compelled him to turn to the Macksburg, Ohio, field for most of\r\nhis petroleum. He had one tank-car, and he ran this back and forth\r\nfaster than ever. Then came the next blow. The railroad over which he\r\nran his tank-car doubled his freight to 35 cents a barrel, from 17-1/2.\r\nThat was not all. The same railroad brought oil to the combination's\r\nMarietta refineries at 10 cents a barrel, while they charged him 35.\r\nThat was not all. The railroad paid over to the combination 25 cents\r\nout of every 35 cents he paid for freight. If he had done all the oil\r\nbusiness at Marietta, and his rival had put out all its fires and let\r\nits works stand empty, it would still have made 25 cents a barrel on\r\nthe whole output. Rice found a just judge when he took this thing into\r\ncourt. \"Abhorrent,\" \"dangerous,\" \"gross,\" \"illegal and inexcusable\r\nabuse by a public trust,\" \"an unparalleled wrong,\" are the terms in\r\nwhich Judge Baxter gave voice to his indignation as he ordered the\r\nremoval of the receiver of the railroad who had made this arrangement\r\nwith the combination, to enable it, as the judge said, \"to crush Rice\r\nand his business.\"[375]\r\n\r\nIn an interview, filling four columns of the New York _World_ of March\r\n29, 1890, the head of the trust which would receive this rebate is\r\nreported to have made this attempt to reverse the facts of this and\r\nsimilar occurrences: \"The railroad company proposed to our agent,\"\r\nhe said. But the judge who heard all the evidence and rendered the\r\ndecision, which has never been reversed or impaired, declared that it\r\n\"compelled\" the railroad to make the arrangement, \"under a threat of\r\nbuilding a pipe line for the conveyance of its oils and withdrawing its\r\npatronage.\" This arrangement was negotiated by the same agent of the\r\noil combination who engineered the similar \"transfer\" scheme by which\r\nthe trunk-line railroads gave it, in 1878, 20 to 35 cents a barrel out\r\nof the freights paid by its competitors in Pennsylvania, as already\r\ntold.[376]\r\n\r\n\"I reluctantly acquiesced,\" the receiver said, writing in confidence\r\nto his lawyer, anxious lest so acquiescing he had made himself legally\r\nliable. The interview describes the arrangement as an innocent thing:\r\n\"A joint agreement for the transportation of oil.\" It was an agreement\r\nto prevent the transportation of oil by anybody else. Judge Baxter\r\nshows that it was a joint agreement, procured by threats, for the\r\ntransportation of \"$25 per day, clear money,\" from Rice's pockets into\r\nthe pockets of the members of the trust for no service rendered, and\r\nwithout his knowledge or consent, and with the transparent purpose of\r\ntransporting his business to their own refineries. Judge Baxter called\r\nit \"discrimination so wanton and oppressive it could hardly have been\r\naccepted by an honest man, and a judge who would tolerate such a wrong\r\nor retain a receiver capable of perpetrating it, ought to be impeached\r\nand degraded from his position.\"[377]\r\n\r\nThis matter was also passed upon by the Select Committee of the United\r\nStates Senate on Interstate Commerce. \"No comment,\" the committee say,\r\n\"is needed upon this most impudent and outrageous proposition\"--by the\r\noil company to the railroad.[378]\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to deny that story?\" a great American statesman of the\r\nlatter-day type was asked by one of his friends.\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" was the reply. \"The story's false. When you find me taking the\r\ntrouble to deny a thing, you can bet it's true!\"\r\n\r\nThis \"agreement for the transportation of oil\" had its calculated\r\neffect. It put a stop to the transportation of oil from the Ohio field\r\nby Rice over the railroad, just as the destruction by the same hands\r\nof the pipe line to the Alleghany had cut him off from access to the\r\nPennsylvania oil-fields. He then built his own pipe line to the Ohio\r\nfield. To lay this pipe it was necessary to cross the pipe line of his\r\ngreat rival. Rice had the pluck to do this without asking for a consent\r\nwhich would never have been given. His intrepidity carried its point,\r\nfor, as he foresaw, they dared not cut his pipe for fear of reprisals.\r\n\r\nIn turning to the South, after his expulsion from the Ohio and Western\r\nmarkets, the Marietta independent did but get out of one hornet's\r\nnest to sit down in another. His opponent was selling its oil there\r\nthrough a representative who, as he afterwards told Congress, \"was very\r\nfortunate in competing.\" He thought it was \"cheaper in the long-run to\r\nmake the price cheap and be done with it, than to fritter away the time\r\nwith a competitor in a little competition. I put the price down to the\r\nbone.\"[379] Rice, in the South, ran into the embrace of this gentleman\r\nwho had the \"exclusive control\" of that territory, and whose method of\r\ncalling the attention of trespassers to his right was to cut them \"to\r\nthe bone.\" The people and the dealers everywhere in the South were glad\r\nto see Rice. He found a deep discontent among consumers and merchants\r\nalike. They perhaps felt more clearly than they knew that business\r\nfeudalism was not better, but worse, because newer, than military\r\nfeudalism. This representative of the combination assured Congress\r\nthat \"99.9 of all the first-class merchants of the South were in close\r\nsympathetical co-operation with us in our whole history\"--that is, out\r\nof every hundred \"first-class merchants\" only one-tenth of one merchant\r\nwas not with them. This is a picturesque percentage.\r\n\r\nRice's welcome among the people would not verify his opponent's\r\nestimate that his vassalage included all but one-tenth of one dealer\r\nin every hundred. From all parts came word of the anxiety of the\r\nmerchants to escape from the power that held them fast. From Texas:\r\n\"Most of our people are anxious to get clear.\" From Arkansas: \"The\r\nmerchants here would like to buy from some other.\" From Tennessee: \"Can\r\nwe make any permanent arrangement with you by which we can baffle such\r\nmonopoly?\" From Kentucky: \"I dislike to submit to the unreasonable\r\nand arbitrary commands.\" From Mississippi: \"It has gouged the people\r\nto such an extent that we wish to break it down and introduce some\r\nother oils.\" From Georgia, from different dealers: \"They have the\r\noil-dealers in this State so completely cooped in that they cannot\r\nmove.\" \"We are afraid.\"[380] As Rice went about the South selling oil\r\nthe agents of the cutter \"to the bone\" would follow, and by threats,\r\nlike those revealed in the correspondence described below, would coerce\r\nthe dealers to repudiate their purchases. Telegrams would pour into\r\nthe discouraged office at Marietta: \"Don't ship oil ordered from your\r\nagent.\" \"We hereby countermand orders given your agent yesterday.\" One\r\ntelegram would often be signed by all the dealers in a town, though\r\ncompetitors, sometimes nearly a dozen of them, showing that they were\r\nunited by some outside influence they had to obey.[381]\r\n\r\nWhere the dealers were found too independent to accept dictation,\r\nbelligerent and tactical cuts in price were proclaimed, not to make\r\noil cheap, but to prevent its becoming permanently cheaper through\r\nfree competition and an open market. Rice submitted to Congress\r\nletters covering pages of the Trust Report,[382] showing how he had\r\nbeen tracked through Tennessee, Missouri, Nebraska, Georgia, Kansas,\r\nKentucky, Iowa, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Alabama.\r\nThe railroads had been got to side-track and delay his cars, and the\r\ndealers terrorized into refusing to buy his oils, although they were\r\ncheaper. If the merchants in any place persisted in buying his oil\r\nthey were undersold until they surrendered. When Rice was driven out\r\nprices were put back. So close was the watch kept of the battle by the\r\ngenerals of \"co-operation\" that when one of his agents got out of oil\r\nfor a day or two, prices would be run up to bleed the public during\r\nthe temporary opportunity. \"On the strength of my not having any oil\r\nto-day,\" wrote one of Rice's dealers, \"I am told they have popped up\r\nthe price 3-1/2 cents.\"[383]\r\n\r\nThe railroad officials did their best to make it true that \"the poor ye\r\nhave with you always.\" By mistake some oil meant for the combination\r\nwas delivered to Rice's agent, and he discovered that it was paying\r\nonly 88 cents a barrel, while he was charged $1.68, a difference of 80\r\ncents a barrel for a distance of sixty-eight miles.\r\n\r\n\"Could you stand such competition as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. Before that I went up there and sold to every man in the\r\nplace nearly. They were glad to see me in opposition.... I lost them,\r\nexcept one man who was so prejudiced that he would not buy from them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your business had been on the increase up to that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Increasing rapidly.... I haul it in wagons now forty miles south of\r\nManito.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rates against you on that railroad are so high that you can for\r\na distance of forty miles transport your oil by wagon and meet the\r\ncompetition better than you can by using their own road?\"\r\n\r\n\"Infinitely better.\"[384]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\"TURN ANOTHER SCREW\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA spy at one end of an institution proves that there is a tyrant at\r\nthe other. Modern liberty has put an end to the use of spies in its\r\ngovernment only to see it reappear in its business.\r\n\r\nRice throughout the South was put under a surveillance which could\r\nhardly have been done better by Vidocq. One of the employés of the oil\r\nclique, having disclosed before the Interstate Commerce Commission that\r\nhe knew to a barrel just how much Rice had shipped down the river to\r\nMemphis, was asked where he got the information. He got it from the\r\nagents who \"attend to our business.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have they to do with looking after Mr. Rice's business?... How do\r\nyour agents tell the number of barrels he shipped in April, May, and\r\nJune?\"\r\n\r\n\"See it arrive at the depot.\"\r\n\r\n\"How often do your agents go to the depot to make the examination?\"\r\n\r\n\"They visit the depot once a day, not only for that purpose, but to\r\nlook after the shipment of our own oil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they keep a record of Mr. Rice's shipments?\"\r\n\r\n\"They send us word whenever they find that Mr. Rice has shipped a\r\ncar-load of oil.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do their statements show with respect to Mr. Rice's shipments\r\nbesides that?\"\r\n\r\n\"They show the number of barrels received at any point shipped by Mr.\r\nRice, or by anybody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"How often are these statements sent to the company?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sent in monthly, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is from a similar monthly report that you get the statement that\r\nin July, August, and September, Mr. Rice shipped 602 barrels of oil to\r\nNashville, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you similar agents at all points of destination?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"[385]\r\n\r\nThis has a familiar look. It is the espionage of the South Improvement\r\nCompany contract, in operation sixteen years after it was \"buried.\"\r\nWhen the representative of the oil combination appears in public with\r\ntabulated statements exhibiting to a barrel the business done by its\r\ncompetitors for any month of any year, at any place, he tells us too\r\nplainly to be mistaken that the \"partly-born,\" completely \"buried\"\r\niniquity, sired by the \"sympathetical co-operation\" of the trustees and\r\ntheir railroad associates of easy virtue, is alive and kicking--kicking\r\na breach in the very foundations of the republic.\r\n\r\nA letter has found the light which was sent by the Louisville man who\r\nwas so \"fortunate in competing,\" immediately after he heard that one\r\nof \"his\" Nashville customers had received a shipment from the Marietta\r\nindependent. It was addressed to the general freight agent of the\r\nLouisville and Nashville Railroad. It complained that this shipment,\r\nof which the writer knew the exact date, quantity, destination, and\r\ncharges, \"slipped through on the usual fifth-class rate.\" \"Please turn\r\nanother screw,\" the model merchant concluded. What it meant \"to turn\r\nanother screw\" became quickly manifest. Not daring to give the true\r\nexplanation, none of the people implicated have ever been able to make\r\na plausible explanation of the meaning of this letter. The railroad man\r\nto whom it was sent interpreted it when examined by Congress as meaning\r\nthat he should equalize rates. But Congress asked him:\r\n\r\n\"Is the commercial phrase for equalizing rates among railroad people\r\n'turn another screw'?\"\r\n\r\nHe had to reply, helplessly, \"I do not think it is.\"\r\n\r\nThe sender before the same committee interpreted it as a request \"to\r\ntighten up the machinery of their loose office.\"[386] Rice found out\r\nwhat the letter meant. \"My rates were raised on that road over 50 per\r\ncent. in five days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it necessary to turn on more than one screw in that direction to\r\nput a stop to your business?\"\r\n\r\n\"One was sufficient.\"[387]\r\n\r\nThe rates to the combination remained unchanged. For five years--to\r\n1886--they did not vary a mill. After the screw had been turned on,\r\nhe who suggested it wrote to the offending merchants at Nashville,\r\nthat if they persisted in bringing in this outside oil he would not\r\nonly cut down the price of oil, but would enter into competition on\r\nall other articles sold in their grocery. He italicized this sentence:\r\n\"_And certainly this competition will not be limited to coal-oil or\r\nany one article, and will not be limited to any one year._\"[388] \"Your\r\nco-operation or your life,\" says he.\r\n\r\n\"Have you not frequently, as a shipper of oil, taken part in the\r\ncompetition with grocers and others in other business than oil, in\r\norder to force them to buy oil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost invariably I did that always.\"[389]\r\n\r\n\"The expense and influence necessary for sustaining the market in this\r\nmanner are altogether expended by us, and not by the representatives\r\nof outside oil,\" he further wrote. \"Influence,\" as a fact of supply\r\nand demand, an element of price-making, is not mentioned in any\r\npolitical economy. And yet the \"influence\" by which certain men have\r\ngot the highways shut to other shippers has made a mark as plain as\r\nthe mountains of the moon on our civilization. \"If we allow any one to\r\noperate in this manner,\" he continued, \"in any one of our localities,\r\nit simply starts off others. And whatever trouble or expense it has\r\ngiven us in the past to prevent it we have found it to be, and still\r\nbelieve it to be, the only policy to pursue.\"[390]\r\n\r\nThey \"are threatening,\" his Nashville agent, after the screw was\r\nturned, wrote Rice, \"to ruin us in our business.\"[391]\r\n\r\nThe head of the Louisville \"bone-cutters,\" when a witness before\r\nCongress during the trust investigation, stigmatized the action of his\r\nNashville victims as \"black-mail.\" They were \"black-mailers\" because\r\nthey had sold a competitor's oil, and refused to continue to sell\r\nhis own unless it was made as cheap or cheaper. Competition, when he\r\npractised it on others, was \"sympathetical co-operation.\" Tried on\r\nhim, it was \"black-mail.\" \"That man wanted us to pay him more than we\r\npaid the other jobbers\"--_i.e._, he wanted them to meet the prices of\r\ncompetitors \"because he thought we had the market sustained, and he\r\ncould black-mail us into it. I bluffed him in language, and language is\r\ncheap.\"[392] The \"language\" that could produce an advance of freights\r\nof 50 per cent. in five days against a competitor was certainly \"cheap\"\r\nfor the man whose rates remained unchanged, and who thereby absorbed\r\nhis neighbor's vineyard. The inevitable result followed at last. Rice\r\nfought out the fight at Nashville seven years, from 1880 to 1887; then,\r\ndefeated, he had to shut up his agency there. That was \"evacuation day\"\r\nat Nashville. It was among his oldest agencies, he told Congress, \"and\r\nit was shut out entirely last year on account of the discriminations. I\r\ncannot get in there.\"[393]\r\n\r\nState inspection of oil and municipal ordinances about storage have\r\nbeen other \"screws\" that have been turned to get rid of competition.\r\nCity councils passed ordinances forbidding oil in barrels to be stored,\r\nwhile allowing oil in tanks, which is very much more dangerous, as\r\nthe records of oil fires and explosions show conclusively. His New\r\nOrleans agent wrote Rice concerning the manoeuvres of his pursuer: \"He\r\nhas been down here for some time, and has by his engineering, and in\r\nconsequence of the city ordinances, cut me out of storage. As matters\r\nnow stand, I would not be able to handle a single barrel of oil.\"[394]\r\nIn Georgia the law was made so that the charge to the oil combination\r\nshipping in tank-cars was only half what it was to others who shipped\r\nin barrels. The State inspector's charge for oil in tanks was made 25\r\ncents a barrel; for oil in barrels it was 50 cents a barrel. But as if\r\nthat was not advantage enough, the inspector inspected the tanks at\r\nabout two-thirds of their actual capacity. If an independent refiner\r\nsent 100 barrels of oil into the State, he would have to pay $50 for\r\ninspection, while the oil combination sending in the same would pay\r\nbut 25 cents a barrel, and that on only 66-2/3 barrels, or $16 in all.\r\nThis difference is a large commercial profit of itself, and would\r\nalone enable the one who received it to sell without loss at a price\r\nthat would cripple all others. In this State the chief inspector had\r\nthe power to appoint inspectors for the towns. He would name them only\r\nfor the larger places, where the combination had storage tanks. This\r\nprevented independent refiners from shipping directly to the smaller\r\nmarkets in barrels, as they could not be inspected there, and if not\r\ninspected could not be sold.[395] All these manoeuvres of inspection\r\nhelped to force the people to buy of only one dealer, to take what he\r\nsupplied, and pay what he demanded. Why should an official appointed\r\nby the people, paid by them to protect them, thus use all his powers\r\nagainst them? Why?\r\n\r\n\"State whether you had not in your employ the State inspector of\r\noil and gave him a salary,\" the Louisville representative of the\r\ncombination was asked by Congress.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"[396]\r\n\r\nThroughout the country the people of the States have been influenced\r\nto pass inspection laws to protect themselves, as they supposed, from\r\nbad oil, with its danger of explosion. But these inspection laws prove\r\ngenerally to be special legislation in disguise, operating directly\r\nto deprive the people of the benefit of that competition which would\r\nbe a self-acting inspection. They are useful only as an additional\r\nillustration of the extent to which government is being used as an\r\nactive partner by great business interests. Meanwhile any effort of\r\nthe people to use their own forces through governments to better their\r\ncondition, as by the ownership of municipal gas-works, street-railways,\r\nor national railroads and telegraphs, is sung to sleep with the lullaby\r\nabout government best, government least.\r\n\r\nThis second campaign had been a formidable affair--a worse was to\r\nfollow; but it did not overcome the independent of Marietta. With all\r\nthese odds against him, he made his way. Expelled from one place and\r\nanother, like Memphis and Nashville, he found markets elsewhere. This\r\nwas because the Southern people gave him market support along with\r\ntheir moral support. Co-operation of father and son and daughter made\r\noil cheaper than the \"sympathetical co-operation\" opposing them, with\r\nits high salaries, idle refineries, and dead-heads. Rice had to pay no\r\ndividends on \"trust\" stock capitalized for fifteen times the value of\r\nthe property. He did not, like every one of the trustees, demand for\r\nhimself an income of millions a year from the consumer. He found margin\r\nenough for survival, and even something more than survival, between the\r\ncost of production and the market price. \"In 1886 we were increasing\r\nour business very largely. Our rates were low enough so that we could\r\ncompete in the general Southern market.\"[397]\r\n\r\nUpon this thrice-won prosperity fell now blow after blow from the same\r\nhand which had struck so heavily twice before. From 1886 to the present\r\nmoment Rice and his family have been kept busier defending their right\r\nto live in business than in doing the business itself. Their old enemy\r\nhas come at them for the third time, with every means of destruction\r\nthat could be devised, from highway exclusion to attacks upon private\r\ncharacter, given currency by all the powerful means at his command. The\r\ngame of 1886 was that of 1879, but with many improvements gained from\r\nexperience and progress of desire. His rates were doubled, sometimes\r\nalmost tripled; in some cases as much as 333 per cent. Rates to his\r\nadversary were not raised at all. The raise was secret. Suspecting\r\nsomething wrong, he called on the railroad officer July 13th, and asked\r\nwhat rates were going to be. The latter replied that he \"had not the\r\nlist made out.\" But the next day he sent it in full to the combination.\r\nRice could not get them until August 23d, six weeks later, and then not\r\nall of them. As in 1879 the new tariff was arranged at a conference\r\nwith the favored shippers.[398]\r\n\r\nThis was the first gun of a concerted attack. Rice was soon under fire\r\nfrom all parts of the field. One road after another raised his rates\r\nuntil it seemed as if the entire Southern market would be closed to\r\nhim. While this was in progress the new Interstate Commerce Law passed\r\nby Congress--in part through the efforts of Rice--to prevent just such\r\nmisuse of the highways, went into effect. But this did not halt the\r\nrailway managers. A month after it was passed the Senate Committee on\r\nInterstate Commerce was shown that discrimination was still going on,\r\nas it is still. At points as far apart as Louisville, New Orleans,\r\nAtlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco switches were spiked against\r\nRice, and the main lines barricaded of all the highways between the\r\nOhio River, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and the Gulf of Mexico. In\r\nthe face of the Interstate Commerce Act the roads raised his freights\r\nto points in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, and\r\nMississippi in no case less than 29, and in some cases as high as 150,\r\n168, and 212 per cent. more than was charged the oil combination. Where\r\nthe latter would pay $100 freight, he, shipping the same amount to the\r\nsame place, would sometimes pay $310--if he got it taken at all.[399]\r\n\r\nThe general freight agent of one of the roads, when before the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, denied this. When confronted with\r\nwritten proof of it he could only say, \"It is simply an error.\"[400]\r\n\r\nRice shows that in some cases these discriminations made him\r\npay four times as much freight, gallon for gallon, as the\r\nmonopoly. The differences against him were so great that even the\r\nself-contained Interstate Commerce Commission has to call them \"a\r\nvast discrepancy.\"[401] The power that pursued him manoeuvred against\r\nhim, as if it were one track, all the railroads from Pennsylvania to\r\nFlorida, from Ohio to Lake Superior and the Pacific coast. \"Through its\r\nrepresentative the oil combination was called before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission to explain its relation to this 'vast discrepancy.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Your company pays full rates?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pays the rates that I understand are the rates for everybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pays what are known as open rates?\"\r\n\r\n\"Open rates; yes, sir.\"[402]\r\n\r\nThat the increase of rates in 1886, like that of 1879, was made by the\r\nrailroads against Rice, under the direction of his trade enemy, is\r\nconfirmed by the unwilling testimony of the latter's representative\r\nbefore Congress. \"I know I have been asked just informally by railroad\r\nmen once or twice as to what answer they should make. They said, Here\r\nis a man--Rice, for instance--writing us that you are getting a lower\r\nrate.\" He was asked if he knew any reason, legal or moral, why the\r\nLouisville and Nashville Railroad should select his firm as the sole\r\npeople in the United States. \"No, sir,\" the witness replied; but then\r\nadded, recovering himself, \"I think they did because we were at the\r\nfront.\"[403] The railroads bring the people they prefer \"to the front,\"\r\nand then, because they are \"at the front,\" make them the \"sole people.\"\r\n\r\nRice did not sleep under this new assault. He went to the\r\nAttorney-General of Ohio, and had those of the railroads which were\r\nOhio corporations brought to judgment before the Supreme Court of\r\nOhio, which revoked their action, and could, if it chose, have\r\nforfeited their charters. The Supreme Court found that these railroads\r\nhad charged \"discriminating rates,\" \"strikingly excessive,\" which\r\n\"tended to foster a monopoly,\" \"actually excluded these competitors,\"\r\n\"giving to the favored shippers absolute control.\"[404] Rice went to\r\nCincinnati, to Louisville, to St. Louis, and Baltimore to see the\r\nofficials of the railroads. He found that the roads to the South\r\nand West, which took his oil from the road which carried it out of\r\nMarietta, were willing to go back to the old rates if the connecting\r\nroad would do so. But the general freight agent of that company would\r\ngive him no satisfaction. He wrote, October 3d, to the president of\r\nthe road over which he had done all his business for years. He got\r\nno answer. He wrote again October 11th, no answer; October 20th, no\r\nanswer; November 14th, no answer. Rice had been paying this road nearly\r\n$10,000 a year for freight, sending all his oil over it. The road had\r\nused its rate-making power to hand over four-fifths of his business\r\nto another, but he has never been able to get so much as a formal\r\nacknowledgment of the receipt of his letters to the head of the road,\r\nasking that his petitions for restoration of his rights on the highway\r\nbe considered. A part only of the letters and telegrams which he sent\r\nduring these years--to get rates, to have his cars moved, to rectify\r\nunequal charges, to receive the same facilities and treatment others\r\ngot--fill pages of close print in the Trust Report of the Congressional\r\nCommittee of Manufactures of 1888.\r\n\r\n\"Your time is a good deal occupied with correspondence, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say so. If the rates had been more regular, I would not have\r\nhad so much correspondence. It takes about all my time to look after\r\nrates.\"[405]\r\n\r\nDriven off his direct road to market, Rice set to hunting other ways.\r\nThe Baltimore and Ohio, he found, was, though very roundabout, the only\r\navenue left by which he could get his oils into Southern markets. He\r\nbegan to negotiate with it immediately, but it was not until several\r\nmonths later--the middle of November--that he succeeded in closing\r\narrangements. To get to Chattanooga, Tennessee, over this route his\r\noil had to travel 1186 miles as against 582 miles by the roads which\r\nhad been closed to him, and yet the rate was lower over the more than\r\ndouble distance. Again, he could send a barrel of oil 1213 miles by the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio to Birmingham, Alabama, for $1.22, while the roads\r\nhe had been using put his rate up to $2.26, although their line to\r\nBirmingham was only 685 miles.\r\n\r\nAll the arrangements had been concluded to the mutual satisfaction\r\nof Rice and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. After this thorough\r\ndiscussion of four months, in which every point had been examined,\r\nRice sends forward his first shipment December 1st. He is not a little\r\nelated to have blazed his way out of the trackless swamp in which he\r\nhad been left by the other roads. His satisfaction is short enough. In\r\nabout a fortnight--on December 15th--the then general freight agent of\r\nthe Baltimore and Ohio telegraphed him that he could not be allowed\r\nto ship any more. \"We will have to withdraw rates on oil to Southern\r\npoints, as the various lines in interest\"--the connections to which the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio delivered the oil for points beyond its own line,\r\nand which shared in the rates--\"will not carry them out.\"\r\n\r\nThis was stunning. It nullified the labor of months which had been\r\nspent in opening a way out of this blockade. It put the cup of ruin\r\nagain to the lips of the family at Marietta, innocent of all offence\r\nbut that of trying to make a living out of the industry of their\r\nchoice, and asking no favors, only the right to travel the public\r\nhighway on equal terms, and to stand in the open markets. The excuse\r\ngiven was heavy-laden with inaccuracy. Rice immediately found out by\r\nwire that the Piedmont Air Line, one of the most important of the\r\nconnections, had not refused to carry at the agreed rate. Its traffic\r\nmanager telegraphed the Baltimore and Ohio people to reconsider their\r\naction, and continue taking Rice's oil. When asked first by Rice,\r\nand afterwards by Congress, to name the lines which refused, as he\r\nalleged, to carry out the rates he had agreed upon, the general freight\r\nagent of the Baltimore and Ohio could not give one. He escaped from\r\nCongress by promising to send its committee, \"within a day or two,\"\r\nall the correspondence with these other companies. Once out of the\r\ncommittee-room, he never sent a scrap of paper to redeem his promise,\r\nand the whole matter was lost sight of by the committee.[406]\r\n\r\nRice, badly shattered, still sought and managed to find a few\r\nlong-way-around routes. He presented to Congress in 1888 a table\r\nshowing how he still managed to get to some of his markets. To\r\nBirmingham, Alabama--the direct route of 685 miles, as well as the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio, being closed to him--he shipped over seven\r\ndifferent railroads forward and backward 1155 miles. The rates of all\r\nthese roads added together made only $2.10 a barrel instead of $2.66,\r\nto which the shorter line had raised its price, for the purpose, as\r\nthis comparison shows, not of getting revenue, but of cutting it off.\r\nTo get into Nashville he had to go around 805 miles over five different\r\nlines instead of 502 miles, as usual, and still had a rate of $1.28\r\ninstead of $1.60.\r\n\r\nFrom 1880, the moment he turned to the Southern field, after the\r\ndestruction of his business in the West, everything that railroad men's\r\ningenuity could do was done to prevent him from becoming a successful\r\nmanufacturer who might increase the amount to be shipped, open new\r\nmarkets, and steady the trade by making it move by many minds of\r\ndifferent views and reasons instead of by one. In order barely to live\r\nhe was kept writing, telegraphing, travelling, protesting, begging,\r\nlitigating, worrying, and agitating by press, prosecutions, private\r\nand public, and by State and national investigation. The ingenuity of\r\nthe railroad officials in chasing him down was wonderful. Nothing was\r\ntoo small if it would hurt. Sometimes the railroad made through rates\r\nso high that it was cheaper for him to ship his oil along by short\r\nstages, paying the local rates from place to place until it reached\r\nits destination. In this way he got a car from Cincinnati to Knoxville\r\nat the rate of 32 cents altogether, when, if it had been shipped at\r\nonce all the way on the through rate, it would have cost 40 cents a\r\nhundred. The railroads have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars,\r\nused up armies of gifted counsel, and spoiled tons of white paper\r\nwith ink to argue out their right to charge more for short hauls than\r\nlong hauls; but when some traffic manager wants to crush one of his\r\nemployer's customers, no short-haul long-haul consistency stands in\r\nhis way.[407] It was not enough to fix his rates at double what others\r\npaid. All kinds of mistakes were made about his shipments. Again and\r\nagain these mistakes were repeated; nor were they, the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission shows, corrected when pointed out.[408] One of\r\nthe stock excuses made by railroad managers for giving preferential\r\nrates to their favorites is that they are the \"largest shippers,\" and,\r\nconsequently, \"entitled to a wholesale rate.\" But when Rice was the\r\nlargest shipper, as he was at New Orleans, they forgot to give him the\r\nbenefit of this \"principle.\" When Rice wrote, asking if a lower rate\r\nwas not being made, the railroad agent replied: \"Let me repeat that the\r\nrates furnished you are just as low as furnished anybody else.\" \"This\r\nlacks accuracy,\" is the comment of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\n\r\nWishing to know if the Louisville and Nashville would unite with other\r\nroads in making through rates to him, Rice asked the question of\r\nits freight agent. He replied: \"I do not see that it is any of your\r\nbusiness.\" \"It was undoubtedly his business,\" the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission says, sharply; \"and his inquiry on the subject was not\r\nwanting either in civility or propriety.\" When Rice asked the same road\r\nfor rates, the officials refused to give them to him, and persisted in\r\ntheir refusal.[409] Like Vanderbilt before the New York Legislative\r\nCommittee, they seemed to think excuses to shippers were a substitute\r\nfor transportation, and evidently thought they had done more than their\r\nduty in answering Rice's letters. But as the Commission dryly observes,\r\ntheir answers to Rice's letters did not relieve him of the injurious\r\nconsequences. In attempting to explain these things to the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, the agent of the railroad said:\r\n\r\n\"If I have not made myself clear, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not,\" one of the Commission interrupted.[410]\r\n\r\nThe refusal to give Rice these rates was an \"illegal refusal,\" the\r\nCommission decided; \"the obligation to give the rates ... was plain and\r\nunquestionable.\" This general freight agent was summoned by Congress to\r\ntell whether or not lower rates had been made to the oil combination\r\nthan to their competitors. He refused to produce the books and papers\r\ncalled for by the subpoena. He had been ordered by the vice-president\r\nof the road, he said, to refuse. He declined to answer the questions of\r\nthe committee. Recalled, he finally admitted the truth: \"We gave them\r\nlower rates in some instances.\"[411]\r\n\r\nRice took to the water whenever he could, as hunted animals do. The\r\nOhio, Mississippi, Tennessee, Missouri were public highways that had\r\nnot been made private property, with general agents or presidents to\r\nsay \"No\" when asked permission to travel over them. He began to ship\r\nby river. The chairman of the Committee of Commerce rose in his seat\r\nin Congress to present favorably a bill to make it illegal to ship oil\r\nof less than 150 degrees fire-test on the passenger boats of inland\r\nwaters. The reason ostentatiously given was public safety. But, as was\r\nat once pointed out in the press, the public safety required no such\r\nlaw. The test proposed was far above the requirement of safety. No\r\nState in its inspection laws stipulated for so high a test. Most of the\r\nStates were satisfied with oil of 110 degrees fire-test; a few, like\r\nOhio, went as high as 120 degrees. All but a very small proportion of\r\nthe oil sent to Europe was only 110 degrees fire-test. The steamboat\r\nmen did not want the law, and were all against it. There was no demand\r\nfrom the travelling public for such legislation. General Warner, member\r\nof Congress, said, in opposing the bill: \"Petroleum which will stand a\r\nfire-test of 110 degrees is safer than baled cotton or baled hay, and\r\nas safe as whiskey or turpentine to be carried on steamers. What is the\r\nobject, then? There can be but one, and I may as well assert it here,\r\nalthough I make no imputation whatever upon the Committee of Commerce,\r\nor any member of it. It will put the whole carrying trade of refined\r\npetroleum into the hands of the railroads and under the control of ...\r\na monopoly which has the whole carrying trade in the oil business on\r\nrailroads, and they will make it as impossible for refiners to exist\r\nalong the lakes and the Ohio River as it is impossible for them now to\r\nexist on any of the railroads of the country.\" Why the trust, though\r\nit was the greatest shipper, should seek to close up channels of\r\ncheapness like the waterways was plain enough. They were highways where\r\nprivilege was impossible. With its competitors shut off the railroads\r\nby privilege, and off the rivers by law, it would be competition proof.\r\n\r\nThe United States authorities, too, moved against Rice, responsive to\r\nthe same \"pull\" that made jumping-jacks for monopoly out of committees\r\nof commerce and railway kings. When the Mississippi River steamer _U.P.\r\nSchenck_ arrived at Vicksburg with 56 barrels of independent oil, the\r\nUnited States marshal came on board to serve a process summoning the\r\nofficers and owners to answer to the charge of an alleged violation of\r\nlaw. Several steamboats were similarly \"libelled.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were threatened a great many times,\" the representative of the\r\nsteamboat company told Congress.[412] The steamboat men were put to\r\ngreat expense and without proper cause. When the cases came to trial\r\nthey were completely cleared in every instance. But the prosecution had\r\ndone its work of harassing competition. The success of the campaign\r\nof 1879 in Ohio was now repeated over a wider field. The attack of\r\n1886, \"in a period of five months,\" Rice said before Congress, \"shut up\r\nfourteen of my agencies out of twenty-four, and reduced the towns we\r\nhad been selling in from seventy-three to thirty-four.\"[413] This was a\r\nloss in one year of 79 per cent., or about four-fifths of his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nIN THE INTEREST OF ALL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference in freights against Rice was so great, as the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission found, after taking hundreds of pages of testimony,\r\nthat he had to pay $600 to $1200, \"or more,\" on the same quantity his\r\nopponent got through for $500. These discriminations were made, as the\r\ncommissioners say, \"on no principle.... Neither greater risks, greater\r\nexpense, competition by water transportation, nor any other fact or\r\ncircumstance brought forward in defence, nor all combined, can account\r\nfor these differences.\"[414]\r\n\r\nThe railroads had, of course, to give some reason, and they put forward\r\nthe plea that it was much more expensive and dangerous to carry Rice's\r\nshipments, which were in barrels, than those of the combination, which\r\nwere in tank-cars.[415] This excuse for charging him rates at which\r\nhe could not ship at all did not stand examination by the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission.\r\n\r\nBut he did not wait for that. When he found the railroads were so fond\r\nof tank-cars, he set about getting them. He wrote the general freight\r\nagent and the president of the road that he would build tank-cars, and\r\nasked what his rate would be then; but he got no answer. He wrote other\r\nroads, but got no answer. He asked the general manager of the Queen\r\nCity and Crescent Route the same question. After a correspondence of\r\nfive months with him and other officials, in which he was shuttlecocked\r\nfrom one to another and back again, he had not only not succeeded in\r\ngetting any tank-car rates, but at the end of that protracted exchange\r\nof letters the general manager wrote: \"I was not aware that you had\r\nasked for rates on oil in tank-cars.\"[416] Rice wrote the Louisville\r\nand Nashville: \"I will build immediately twenty tank-cars if you will\r\nguarantee me ... as low a net rate as accorded any other shipper.\"\r\nCommenting on his failure to get answers, the commissioners say:\r\n\"Complainant did not succeed in obtaining rates. The denial of his\r\nright was plain, and stands unexcused.... What reason there may have\r\nbeen for it\"--the refusal of rates--\"we do not know, but find that they\r\nwere not just or legal reasons.\"[417]\r\n\r\nHow history is made! One of the reasons given by the solicitor of the\r\noil trust[418] for its success is its use of the tank-car, with the\r\nobvious inference that its would-be competitors had no such enterprise.\r\nAnd Peckham, in his valuable and usually correct \"Census Report on\r\nPetroleum,\" in 1885, says that the railroads require shippers to use\r\ntank-cars![419]\r\n\r\nDetermined to keep in the field and to have tank-cars, if tank-cars\r\nwere so popular with the railroad officials, Rice went to the leading\r\nmanufacturers to have some built. He found they were glad to get his\r\ncontract. After making arrangements at considerable trouble and expense\r\nto build him the cars, they telegraphed him that they had to give it\r\nup. Bankers, who had promised to advance them money on the security of\r\nthe cars, backed out \"on account of some supposed controversy which\r\nthey claim you have had with the Standard Oil Company and various\r\nrailroads in the West. They feared you could not use these cars to\r\nadvantage if the railroads should be hostile to your interests.\"[420]\r\n\r\nThrough the all-pervading system of espionage, to which cities[421]\r\nas well as individuals were subject, his plans had been discovered\r\nand thwarted. The espionage over shipments provided for by the\r\nSouth Improvement scheme has now extended to business between\r\nmanufacturer and manufacturer. Why should it stop at unsealing private\r\ncorrespondence in the post-office in the European style, and making its\r\ncontents known to those who need the information for the protection of\r\ntheir rights to the control of the markets?\r\n\r\nRice, who was nothing if not indomitable, finally got ten cars from the\r\nHarrisburg works. But this supply was entirely inadequate, and he had\r\nto continue doing the bulk of his business in barrels. What a devil's\r\ntattoo the railroad men beat on these barrels of his! They made him pay\r\nfull tariff rates on every pound weight of the oil and of the barrel,\r\nbut they hauled free the iron tanks, which were the barrels of his\r\nrivals, and also gave them free the use of the flat-cars on which the\r\ntanks were carried.[422] Hauling the tanks free, on trucks furnished\r\nfree, was not enough. The railroads hauled free of all charge a large\r\npart, often more than half, of the oil put into the tanks. In the exact\r\nphrase of the Interstate Commerce Commission, they made out their bills\r\nfor freight to the oil combination \"regardless of quantity.\" This is\r\ncalled \"blind-billing.\"\r\n\r\nOf the 3000 tank-cars of the combination only two carried as little as\r\n20,000 pounds; according to the official figures there were hundreds\r\ncarrying more than 30,000 pounds, and the weight ran up to 44,250\r\npounds, but they were shipped at 20,000 pounds.[423] A statement put in\r\nevidence showed that shipments in tank-cars actually weighing 1,637,190\r\npounds had been given to the roads by the combination as weighing only\r\n1,192,655 pounds. Cars whose loads weighed 44,250, 43,700, 43,500,\r\n36,550 pounds were shipped as having on board only 20,000 pounds. At\r\nthis rate more than one-quarter of the transportation was stolen.\r\n\r\nThe stockholders of the road were paying an expensive staff of\r\ninspectors to detect attempts of shippers to put more in their cars\r\nthan they paid for, but these shippers paid for three car-loads and\r\nshipped from four to six regularly, and were never called to account.\r\nThis \"blind-billing,\" the Commission said, was \"specially oppressive.\"\r\nIt was done by the roads in violation of their own rule. It had\r\nbeen mutually agreed among them, and given out to the public, \"that\r\ntank-cars shall be taken at actual weight.\"[424]\r\n\r\nWhen Rice was trying to get the roads to allow him to use tank-cars,\r\nhe asked how the charge on them was calculated. Of those that answered\r\nnone answered right. None of them gave him the slightest intimation\r\nthat there was any such practice as \"blind-billing.\" On the contrary,\r\nthey assured him he would have to pay for every pound he shipped.\r\nThe Missouri Pacific replied with a \"statement not warranted by the\r\nfacts,\" as the Commission softly put it. They said they charged\r\nfor the \"actual weight,\" while, as the Commission shows, they made\r\nshipments \"regardless of quantity.\" Rice asked the Newport News\r\nand Mississippi Valley Railroad for tank-car rates. \"A tank-car is\r\nsupposed to weigh (carry) 20,000 pounds; if it weighs more, then we\r\nwill charge for it.\" At the same time the agent wrote Rice this, he\r\nwas hauling cars containing 35,000 pounds \"with no additional charge.\"\r\n\"If this statement was made in good faith,\" the Commission says, \"it\r\nis difficult to account for it, and it is not accounted for.\" \"Had he\r\n(Rice) provided himself with cars for tank shipment, and been charged\r\nas he was told he would be, the discrimination against him would have\r\nput success in the traffic out of the question.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they wanted to turn some new screw in freight rates against Rice,\r\nthe railroad officials would whip themselves around the stump by\r\nprinting a new tariff sheet on a type-writer, and tacking it, perhaps,\r\nas one of the Interstate Commerce Commission said, on some back door in\r\ntheir offices. This they called \"publishing\" their rates, as required\r\nby the Interstate Commerce law. To Rice, asking for tank-car rates,\r\nthey would send this printed sheet, showing that if he shipped by\r\ntank-car he must pay for every pound, and they held him off with this\r\nprinted, official, and apparently authentic tariff, though shipping\r\n44,000 for 20,000 pounds for the trust. This was done after the\r\nInterstate Commerce Act went into force.[425]\r\n\r\nOne of these roads assured Rice that its rates had been fixed \"by the\r\nspecial authority of the National Railway Commissioners.\" The fact was,\r\nas the Commission declares: \"The Commission never investigated coal-oil\r\nrates, or gave special authority for their renewal; it never sanctioned\r\nany difference in the rates as between tank-car and barrel shipments,\r\nand had never, up to the date of this letter, had its attention called\r\nto them in any way.\"[426]\r\n\r\nThe representative of the combination was called as a witness before\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission. \"We pay for exactly what is put\r\nin the tanks,\"[427] he testified. \"In fact, this was never done,\"\r\nsays the Commission.[428] Even the railroad officials, who could go\r\nany length in \"blind-billing\" for him, could not \"go it blind\" on the\r\nwitness-stand to the extent of supporting such a statement. \"Our price\r\nper tank-car was not based on any capacity or weight; they have been\r\nmade simply per tank-car.\"[429]\r\n\r\n\"What, generally, is the object of false billing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose to beat the railroad company.\"[430]\r\n\r\nIn defence of the discrimination against the barrel shippers, a great\r\ndeal has been made of danger from fire, damage to cars from leakage,\r\nand trouble of handling in the case of barrel shipments, but the best\r\nexpert opinion which the Interstate Commerce Commission could get\r\nwent against all these plausible pretences.[431] The manager of the\r\ntank line on the Pennsylvania roads showed that the risks were least\r\nwhen the transportation was in barrels. Another reason given for the\r\nlower rates on tanks was that they returned loaded with turpentine\r\nand cotton-seed oil from the South; but, as the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission shows, this traffic was taken at rates so astonishingly low\r\nthat it was of little profit;[432] and the commissioner of the Southern\r\nRailway and Steamship Association informed the Commission that the\r\nreturn freight business in cotton alone, brought back by the box-cars,\r\nto say nothing of other freight, was worth more than these back-loads\r\nof turpentine in the tank-cars.[433] It was, consequently, the box-car\r\nin which barrel shipments were made, and not the tanks, on which the\r\nrailroad men should have given a better rate, according to their own\r\nreasoning. Turpentine and cotton-seed oil are worth three or four times\r\nmore than kerosene, and it costs no more, no less, to haul one than the\r\nother; but the railroads would carry the cotton-seed oil and turpentine\r\nfor one-third or one-fourth the rate they charged for kerosene. The\r\nCommission could not understand why the rates given by the roads on\r\nthese back-loads of turpentine and cotton-seed oil were so low. \"This\r\ncharge, for some reason not satisfactorily explained to the Commission,\r\nis made astonishingly low when compared with the charge made upon\r\npetroleum, although the cotton-seed oil is much the more valuable\r\narticle.\"[434]\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the South have contained many items of news\r\nindicating that the men who have made the oil markets theirs have\r\nsimilarly appropriated the best of the turpentine trade, but nothing is\r\nknown through adjudicated testimony. The trustees of oil have always\r\ndenied that there was any connection between them and the Cotton-seed\r\nOil Trust, although the latter shipped its product in the oil trust's\r\ncars. The reasons, therefore, for the \"extraordinarily low\" rates made\r\non the turpentine and cotton-seed oil shipped North in its tank-cars\r\nmust remain, until further developments, where the Commission leaves\r\nit--\"not satisfactorily explained.\" The railroads said they made\r\nthe rates low for tanks because of the enticing prospects of these\r\nback-loads, in which there was no profit to speak of; but they\r\nextended these special rates to points from which there was no such\r\nback-loading.[435] Rice saw how the cost of sending his oil South could\r\nbe reduced by bringing back-loads of turpentine at these \"astonishingly\r\nlow\" rates. He found there was still turpentine in the South he could\r\nbuy; but the railroads would not so much as answer his application for\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n\"They absolutely refused.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was this refusal since the Interstate Commerce decision in your case?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; since that decision.\"[436]\r\n\r\nIt might have been thought this would have been enough--hauling the\r\ntank itself free; furnishing the flat-cars free for many tanks;\r\ncarrying free a quarter to a half, \"or more.\" But there was more than\r\nthis. The railroads paid the combination for putting its tank-cars on\r\ntheir lines. For every mile these cars were hauled, loaded or empty,\r\nthe roads paid it a mileage varying from 3/4 to 1-1/2 cents. This\r\nmileage was of itself a handsome revenue, enough to pay a profit of 6\r\nper cent. on its investment in the cars. But when Rice asked what the\r\nrailroads would charge him for hauling back his empty tank-cars, he was\r\nnot told that he would be paid for their use, as others were. He was\r\ntold that he would be charged \"generally a cent and a half a mile,\"\r\nor, \"we make the usual mileage charge on return of empty tanks.\" \"This\r\nlast statement,\" the Interstate Commerce Commissioners say, \"was not\r\nwarranted by the facts.\"[437] The vessel which contains the oil of the\r\ncombination \"receives a hire coming and going,\" Mr. Rice's lawyer said\r\nbefore the Committee of Congress on Commerce; \"that which contains\r\nRice's oil pays a tax.\" When Rice tried to sell his oil on the Pacific\r\ncoast he found that if he shipped in tank-cars he would have to pay $95\r\nto bring the empty car back, which others got back free.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the oil combination was questioned about all this\r\nby the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\n\r\n\"Are you allowed mileage on tank-cars?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither way.\"[438]\r\n\r\nBut the railroad officials again could not \"blind-bill\" him as far as\r\nthis. Asked what mileage they paid him, they replied:\r\n\r\n\"Three-quarters of a cent a mile.\"[439]\r\n\r\nWhen the freight agents who did these queer things at the expense of\r\ntheir employers--_i.e._, their proper employers, the stockholders--were\r\nput on the stand before the Interstate Commerce Commission to explain,\r\nthey cut a sorry figure. \"It was an oversight,\" \"a mistake,\" said one.\r\nAnother could only ring confused changes on \"I think it is an error....\r\nI cannot tell why that is so.... It is simply an error.... I cannot\r\ntell.\"[440] There were never any errors, suppositions, oversights for\r\nRice.[441] Referring to this, the Commission says, caustically:\r\n\r\n\"The remarkable thing about the matter is that so many of these\r\ndefendants should make the same mistake--a mistake, too, that it was\r\nantecedently so improbable any of them would make. The Louisville and\r\nNashville, the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific, the Newport\r\nNews and Mississippi Valley, and the Illinois Central companies are\r\nall found giving out the same erroneous information, and no one of\r\nthem can tell how or why it happened to be done, much less how so many\r\ncould contemporaneously, in dealing with the same subject, fall into so\r\nstrange an error. It is to be noted, too, that it is not a subordinate\r\nagent or servant who makes the mistake in any instance, but it is the\r\nman at the head of the traffic department, and whose knowledge on the\r\nsubject any inquirer would have a right to assume must be accurate. In\r\nno case is the error excused.\"[442]\r\n\r\nThe cases in which Rice prosecuted the railroads before the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission are among the most important that\r\nhave been tried by the Commission. The charges made by Rice were\r\nconclusively proved, except as to some minor roads and circumstances.\r\nThe Commission declared the rates that were charged him to be illegal\r\nand unjust, and a discrimination that must be stopped. It ordered the\r\nroads to discontinue using their power as common carriers to carry\r\nRice's property into the possession of a rival. \"The conclusion is\r\nirresistible that the rate sheets were not considerately made with a\r\nview to relative justice.\"[443]\r\n\r\nThe facts of these discriminations--\"unjust,\" \"illegal,\" and\r\n\"abhorrent\"--are on the records as judicially and finally determined.\r\nBut one of the combination said before the Pennsylvania Legislature, at\r\nHarrisburg, as reported in the Harrisburg _Patriot_, February 19, 1891:\r\n\r\n \"I say to you all, in good faith, that since the passage of the\r\n Interstate Commerce law, and the introduction of that system, we have\r\n never taken a rebate. I mean we have taken no advantage over what any\r\n other shipper can get. I make the statement broadly, and I challenge\r\n the statement to the very utmost, and will pay the expenses of any\r\n litigation undertaken to try it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was found that this practice of charging the preferred shipper\r\nfor only 20,000 pounds when it shipped 25,000, 30,000, 40,000, or\r\n44,000, was going to be investigated by the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, there were intellects ready to meet the emergency. A pot\r\nof paint and a paint-brush furnished the shield of righteousness.\r\nEach car being known by its number, and only by its number, all the\r\nold numbers of the 3000 tank-cars of the oil trust were painted\r\nout, and new numbers painted on. Whether its mighty men left their\r\nluxurious palaces in New York, and stole about in person after dark,\r\neach with paint-pot and brush, or whether they asked employés to do\r\nsuch work, the evidence does not state. The device was simple, but\r\nit did. Rice was suing for his rights to use the highways before\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission, and before the Supreme Court of\r\nOhio, through the Attorney-General of the State, who had found the\r\nmatter of sufficient importance to use his official power to institute\r\nsuits in _quo-warranto_ against two railroads. It was necessary that\r\nevidence should be forthcoming in these suits to prove what his rate\r\nwas in comparison with the others. The only way this could be done was\r\nby comparing the actual size of the cars with the size given in the\r\nfreight bills, or manifests. The cars are known in the bills only by\r\ntheir numbers, and without its number no car could be identified. The\r\nreport of Congress reprints the following from the testimony of the\r\nrepresentative of the trust before the Interstate Commerce Commission:\r\n\r\n\"Has there recently been any general change in the numbering of the\r\ncars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; there has been quite a general renumbering, repainting, and\r\noverhauling.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did that change take place?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it was commenced some time in July; it may have been later.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of that renumbering made it practically impossible to\r\nidentify any car as connected with any shipment made before that time.\r\nThe cars were there, looking as fresh and innocent as good men who\r\nhave donned robes of spotless white earned by the payment of generous\r\npew-rent. The cars showed even to the unassisted eye, as the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission said, how much larger they were than was pretended.\r\nThere were still the accounts of the railroads, showing that these cars\r\nhad been \"blind-billed\" as containing only 20,000 pounds, but the cars\r\nmentioned in the manifesto could no longer be identified with the cars\r\non the tracks. The sin of \"blind-billing\" was washed out in paint. Rice\r\nwent to the Interstate Commerce Commission with his complaint in this\r\ncase in July. Immediately the repainting and renumbering took place.\r\n\"It was commenced some time in July; it may have been later.\"[444]\r\n\r\nIn such cases time is money, and more. \"Seest thou a man diligent in\r\nbusiness, he shall stand before kings. He shall not stand before mean\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of this combination have many thousand tank-cars engaged\r\nin carrying their oil, and some of them have another kind of tank-car\r\ntravelling about the country. Under the head of the \"Gospel Car\" the\r\n_Daily Statesman_, of Portland, Oregon, printed the following article,\r\nSunday, December 13, 1891: \"THE GOSPEL CAR.--The mission car 'Evangel'\r\narrived yesterday, and was side-tracked on the penitentiary switch. A\r\nsong service attracted many people during the morning. There will be\r\nservices at 10.30 this morning, and in the afternoon, at 3 o'clock, a\r\nSunday-school will be organized. This will be the first Sunday-school\r\never organized from the gospel car, which has been on the road since\r\nlast spring. The 'Evangel' is sixty feet in length, ten feet wide, and\r\nseats nearly one hundred people. It is the generous gift of\"--several\r\nNew York millionaires, the most important of them belonging to the\r\noil trust--\" ... to the American Baptist Publication Society. The\r\nreverend gentleman who was in charge of the 'Evangel,'\" the _Statesman_\r\ncontinued, \"will visit the smaller towns along the railway, and conduct\r\nevangelistic meetings in the car.\" One of these cars was in Chicago\r\nearly in 1893, and was admiringly described by the Chicago press.\r\nThough corporations have no souls they are ready to help save the souls\r\nof others, for the railroads give these cars free hauling, and the\r\nmessages and the packages of its occupants are franked by the telegraph\r\nand express companies. The contents of this tank-car are distributed\r\nby its donors to the people without money and without price. It is\r\nconceivable that by making it so \"cheap\" and by multiplying the\r\n\"Evangel\" into an evangelical tank line of thousands of cars, the\r\ndonors might drive the churches, which have no tank-cars, out of the\r\nbusiness, as they have done the tankless refiners, and ultimately add\r\nto their monopoly of the Light of the World that of the Light of the\r\nother World.\r\n\r\nTho effect of all this on the family co-operation at Marietta does\r\nnot need to be described. Its head told Congress that if he had had\r\nno difficulty in getting the same freight as others he could have run\r\nhis refinery to its full capacity, and could have increased his works\r\nlargely.\r\n\r\n\"Are not your expenses less than theirs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.... I am running very moderately now.... One-third to\r\none-half generally.\"[445]\r\n\r\n\"I am virtually ruined,\" he says still later in a statement of his\r\ncondition in a circular to the public, urging them to petition\r\nCongress to make the imperfect Interstate Commerce law operative. He\r\nis virtually ruined, though he has won his cases before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, and that Federal tribunal has ordered the roads to\r\ngive him his rights on the highways; but it has been a barren victory.\r\nHis circular is entitled \"My Experience Very Briefly Told.\" Its opening\r\nsentences give us in a phrase the secret of the significance of Rice's\r\nstory, and dignify his appeal to the public. They show how thoroughly\r\nadversity had driven home into this plain man's mind a great civic\r\ntruth which his fellow-citizens have not yet learned, probably because\r\nthey have not yet had adversity enough. His solitary and fruitless,\r\nalthough successful, struggle taught him that the citizens of industry\r\ncan no more maintain their rights acting singly than the citizens of\r\ngovernment. He had learned that \"competition,\" \"supply and demand,\"\r\n\"eternal laws of trade,\" were catchwords as impotent in the markets to\r\ngive individuals their rights, if unassociated, as the incantations of\r\nroyalty and loyalty, and law and order, to save people from their king\r\nuntil they made themselves a People. Persons fail; only a People can\r\nget and keep freedom. This Rice had begun to learn from his failure to\r\nenforce single-handed rights which all the courts declared were his,\r\nbut which no court could secure. In his card to the people, he said:\r\n\"I am fighting for my rights and for my existence (which happens to be\r\nin the interest of all) single-handed and alone, at my own expense and\r\ntime lost.... I am here ... to do what I can to get the Interstate\r\nCommerce Act amended at this present session of the Fiftieth Congress,\r\nto cure existing evils, and all I ask is that you will take hold and\r\nassist me by your signature and approval to the enclosed petition.\r\nYou are subject to the same influences, and now is your time, my\r\nfellow-countrymen, to come forward and assist a little to stop this\r\nnefarious work.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the interest of all.\" This is exactly the relation which the\r\nstruggle of this common citizen bears to the general welfare. The\r\ninvestigation by the Ohio Legislature in 1879;[446] the removal by the\r\nUnited States Court of the railroad receiver who agreed to pay the\r\noil trust $25 out of every $35 freight collected from Rice;[447] the\r\nrefund ordered by the Supreme Court of Ohio from a pipe-line company\r\nwhich had charged Rice 15 cents extra on every barrel he shipped to\r\npay it to his competitors;[448] the successful prosecution, by the\r\nAttorney-General of Ohio before the Supreme Court, of the railroads\r\ndiscriminating against Rice;[449] the cases before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission from its beginning till now, involving hundreds of\r\nrailroads, and decided, so far as it did decide, on almost every point\r\nin Rice's favor;[450] the disruption, as far as forms go, of the oil\r\ntrust in Ohio by the Supreme Court of the State ousting corporations\r\nfrom the right to become members of such combinations and to pool their\r\nearnings therein;[451] the investigation of the oil trust by Congress\r\nin 1888 and 1889, devoted in large part to the various aspects of\r\nRice's experience--these are some only of the public functions which\r\nhad to be invoked in the ineffectual attempt to protect this one man on\r\nthe high-road and in his livelihood, and they show how little his was\r\nmerely a \"private affair.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the amendment of the Interstate Commerce law was before Congress\r\nin 1889, eminent counsel were employed by Rice to explain the defects\r\nof the law to the committees, and petitions to Congress through his\r\ninstrumentality were circulated all over the country, and numerously\r\nsigned. Though a poor man, who could ill afford it, he gave time\r\nand money and attention, frequently spending weeks at Washington,\r\ndiscussing the subject with members, and presenting petitions. The\r\nact was amended in partial accordance with these petitions and\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the elementary right of a stockholder, never withheld in the\r\ncourse of ordinary business--to vote and receive dividends on stock in\r\nthe oil trust which the trustees had sold and he had bought in the open\r\nmarket--Rice had to sue through all the New York courts from 1888 to\r\n1892. The Court of Appeals decided that there had been no lawful reason\r\nfor the denial of his rights, and ordered that they be accorded him.\r\nThis was another barren victory. The trust had meanwhile ostensibly\r\nbeen dissolved; but the dissolution has every appearance of being like\r\nthat of its progenitor, the South Improvement Company, a dissolution\r\n\"in name\" only; not in reality. In place of the old trust certificates\r\nlisted on the New York Stock Exchange, new certificates have been\r\nissued which were selling in the spring of 1894 at about the same\r\nquotation as the former ones.\r\n\r\nIn this case the trust asked the New York courts to deny Rice his\r\nrights because he had in other matters, and as to other parties,\r\nappealed to other courts. His other suits had been against the\r\nrailroads, not against the oil combination. He acted on the defensive,\r\nand went into court only to save himself from commercial strangulation.\r\nIn all of them that went to trial he was successful, with but one or\r\ntwo exceptions. He was so successful that even the judges who heard his\r\ncase and decided in his favor were moved to outbursts of unaffected\r\nindignation on the bench. The only result aimed at or procured was that\r\nthe courts decreed that these common carriers must in the future give\r\nthis citizen his legal rights on the railways; not that he must have\r\nthe same rates as his opponent, but only that the difference in their\r\nfavor shall not be \"excessive,\" \"illegal,\" \"unjust.\"\r\n\r\nBecause of this attempt to secure the fair use of the highways side by\r\nside with it, the trust pleaded in the Supreme Court of New York that\r\nhis appeal to courts as a shipper was a reason why the courts should\r\nwithhold his rights as a stockholder.\r\n\r\nIn making this plea the trustees described themselves as having been\r\nfor years persecuted by the independent of Marietta, and moistened the\r\ndry pages of their legal pleadings with appeals for the sympathy of the\r\ncourts and the public. He has \"diligently and persistently sought to\r\nbecome acquainted with\" our \"methods of business and private affairs;\"\r\n\"he has used efforts to injure\" our \"business\"; \"he is attempting to\r\nharass, injure, and annoy\" us; \"he has ever since ... 1876, when he\r\nfirst engaged in business, ... maintained a hostile attitude, and\r\nbeen engaged in hostile transactions and proceedings against\" us, ...\r\n\"for the purpose of injuring\" us and our \"business\"; he \"has been\r\nuninterruptedly prosecuting ... a series of litigations ... in the\r\ncourts, as well as before the Interstate Commerce Commission, and\r\nbefore an investigating committee of Congress ... for the purpose of\r\nharassing and annoying\" us.[452] And when in 1891 Rice was appealing\r\nto the Attorney-General of New York to bring suit in the name of the\r\nState against the oil combination in New York, like that which had been\r\nsuccessfully brought in Ohio, he was publicly stigmatized in court as\r\na \"black-mailer\" because he had once named a price at which he was\r\nwilling to sell his refinery and quit. So the citizens of Nashville\r\nwere called black-mailers for competing, and the citizens of Buffalo\r\nfor bringing a criminal conspiracy to justice.\r\n\r\nIt is this dancing attendance upon State legislatures, courts,\r\nattorney-generals, Congress, the Interstate Commerce Commission, as\r\nshown in this recital, which the modern American business man must add\r\nto Thrift, Industry, and Sobriety as a condition of survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nORDINARY SUPPLY AND DEMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do I understand you that they have not sought in any way to make the\r\noperations of refineries outside the trust so unprofitable that parties\r\nwould either come into the trust or have to abandon the business--has\r\nanything of that sort been done?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have not; no, sir, they have not,\" was the triple negative of the\r\npresident.\r\n\r\n\"They\" (the trustees) \"have lived on good terms with what I may call\r\ntheir competitors?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have; and have to-day very pleasant relations with those\r\ngentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far as you know,\" he was asked, \"the product of the crude oil and\r\nthe manufacture and sale of the refined oil has been absolutely left to\r\nthe ordinary rules of supply and demand, has it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has.\"[453]\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1873 a young farmer living among the blue hills of\r\nWyoming, in western New York, where he had been born and bred, was\r\nasked by a stranger from Rochester to help him in a search for oil\r\nlands. The old-fashioned quiet of the little community was agitated by\r\nthe hope that the milk and honey of their valleys might be replaced\r\nby a more precious flow. The stranger and his son were prosperous oil\r\nrefiners, but a little cloud, about the size of a \"trustee's\" hand,\r\nhad crept into their sunshine. As they set about drilling a well on\r\nsome \"likely-looking\" land they had leased, the stranger told the\r\nfarmer why he was so anxious to strike oil for his own exclusive use.\r\nThe reader is better prepared to understand his explanation than the\r\nthen inexperienced agriculturist to whom he gave his confidence. It had\r\nbegun to be difficult for him to get a full and regular supply of the\r\ncrude petroleum for his works. There were restrictions, he said, about\r\nthe shipments.[454] What that meant the young farmer was to learn for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThere was no oil in Wyoming, and the refiner went back to Rochester,\r\nand, as so many others have done, sold the control of his works,\r\nthe Vacuum, to the \"successful men\" of the combination, and stepped\r\nsilently into the minority place. His Wyoming friend, Charles B.\r\nMatthews, had continued in his service, and when the Vacuum was sold\r\nhe and two other of its employés made up their minds to go into the\r\nbusiness of refining in Buffalo on their own account. They were under\r\nno obligations or contract to remain, and did not suppose themselves\r\nto have been sold along with the concern. They were capable men, and\r\nshowed great business sense in their arrangements. Buffalo, by its\r\nconnections by rail and the lake with the market, and its nearness\r\nto the oil supply, was a much better situation than Rochester or\r\nCleveland. An independent refining company--the Atlas--was then\r\nconstructing an independent pipe line from the oil regions to Buffalo.\r\n\"This made Buffalo the best point for establishing refining industries\r\nin the country, with its canal and lake transportation for the products\r\nof the factory, and with a pipe line, in the hands of independents,\r\nfrom the crude oil wells to the city,\" said the Buffalo _Express_.\r\nMatthews had by this time had several years' experience in the\r\nbusiness. Of the two with him, Albert was a laborer, who had worked\r\nhis way up in the Vacuum refinery until he could run the stills, and\r\nhad learned how to make oil. He and his thrifty wife had saved a few\r\nthousand dollars. He was ambitious. He had learned at school and in the\r\narmy and at Fourth-of-July celebrations that America is a free country\r\nfor all, and that there are no classes here, and that any workman\r\nmay go to the top. Farmer Matthews had fed his boyhood with stories\r\nof country boys who had gone to the city and matured into business\r\nmagnates. He and Albert pooled their visions and their savings,\r\nborrowed some money, and went to work. As for competition, though\r\nthey knew it was close, they were not afraid but that they could hold\r\ntheir own in a fair fight, and of anything but a fair fight they never\r\ndreamed.\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to get your crude oil?\" Albert and Matthews were\r\nasked when they went to tell their employer what they were going to do.\r\n\r\n\"From the Atlas pipe line.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will wake up some day and find that there is no Atlas Oil Company.\r\n\r\n\"We have ways,\" he continued, \"of making money you know nothing about,\"\r\nusing, singularly enough, the phraseology employed by a greater man in\r\nthe interview with another would-be competitor.[455]\r\n\r\n\"As gentlemen,\" he went on to say, \"I respect you, but as to the\r\nBuffalo Lubricating Oil Company I shall do all in my power to injure or\r\ndestroy it.\"[456]\r\n\r\nAfterwards Albert alone was sent for. \"Don't you think it would be\r\nbetter for you to leave these men, and have $20,000 deposited to your\r\nwife's credit than go with these parties?\"\r\n\r\n\"I went out with them in good faith, and I propose to stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be only a matter of a few days with the Buffalo institution at\r\nthe furthest. We will crush them out, and you will lose what little you\r\nhave got.\"\r\n\r\nAlbert was shown an elaborate statement of the cost of making oil and\r\nits selling price, proving that there was no money in oil.[457] The\r\nrecord of dividends was produced in court afterwards. It showed that\r\njust before this--January 18, 1881--a dividend of 50 per cent. had been\r\npaid in one month.[458] Dividends of $300,000 had been paid in 1881 on\r\nthe capital of $100,000. \"No wonder they did not want competition,\"\r\nsaid the New York _World_.\r\n\r\nThese negotiations had been with the son. Albert not yielding to this\r\npressure, and pushing ahead with the construction of the rival stills,\r\nthe father, who was in California, came back. At his request Albert\r\nagain interrupted the work on the new refinery, which he alone of\r\nthe partners could direct, and came from Buffalo to Rochester for an\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n\"You have made a grand mistake,\" said his old employer, \"by going out\r\nwith those fellows.... The company will not last long.... The result\r\nwill be, if you stay with them, you will lose all you have got in\r\nit.... We are going to commence suits against them. We will not only\r\nsue them, but serve an injunction on them and stop their work. The\r\nresult of it is that when these suits commence, if you are in it, you\r\nwill be responsible, and you have got a little money, and you will lose\r\nit all.... If you come back and work with us everything will be all\r\nright, and we will make everything satisfactory to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I leave them it will leave them in bad shape,\" Albert urged.\r\n\r\n\"That is just exactly what I want to do,\"[459] his former employer\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nAlbert began to weaken. \"I had,\" he afterwards told in court, ...\r\n\"about $6000 altogether, or a little more. They had reason to know\r\nthat I had some property there.\"[460] This was all he had to show for\r\nthe work of a lifetime, and it began to look as if it were fading away\r\nunder these reiterated threats and warnings, which went on from March\r\nto June. Albert gave way. He went to his lawyer, Mr. Truesdale, of\r\nRochester. \"We have come,\" said his former employer, who accompanied\r\nhim, \"to see what disposition can be made of Al's property.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are going to bust the company up,\" said Albert to his lawyer,\r\nwhen asked why he was going back to the Vacuum Company. \"I am an\r\nindorser on one of its notes, and if I do not come back with the\r\nVacuum, what property and money I have will be taken away from me.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer was pressed to tell how Albert could get out of his\r\narrangement with his company. They could not get along without him, and\r\nwere not likely to discharge him.\r\n\r\n\"If they won't release him or buy him out, the only other way,\" said\r\nthe lawyer, \"is to leave them, and take the consequences. If he has\r\nentered into a contract and violated it, I presume there will be a\r\nliability for damages as well as for the debts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there is other ways for Albert to get out of it,\" said the\r\nrepresentative of the Vacuum method in commerce and morals.\r\n\r\n\"I see no way except to back out or sell out; no other honorable way,\"\r\npersisted the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose he should arrange the machinery so it would bust up or smash\r\nup, what would the consequences be?\"\r\n\r\n\"If negligently, carelessly, not purposely done, he would be only\r\ncivilly liable for damages caused by his negligence; but if it was\r\nwilfully done, there would be a further criminal liability for\r\nmalicious injury to the property of the company.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't want me, would you,\" said the poor man to his late\r\nemployer and friend, \"to do anything to lay myself liable?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been police justice,\" said the Vacuum man to the lawyer, \"and\r\nhave had some experience in criminal law. I would like to have you look\r\nup the law carefully on that point, and we will see you again.\"[461]\r\nOr, in effect: \"See about how much crime we can commit,\" District\r\nAttorney Quinby paraphrased it afterwards to the jury.\r\n\r\nIn a day or so the two managers of the Vacuum--father and son--came\r\nback again with Albert.\r\n\r\n\"Have you looked up that matter, Mr. Truesdale?\" asked they.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have looked it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"My impression has not changed. Such a course would involve him in a\r\ncriminal liability if he did it on purpose. Everybody who advised or\r\ncounselled him in such a course would be equally liable with him. The\r\nconsequences, if you follow that course, would be that you would get\r\ninto State's prison. If he is an honest man he won't think of taking\r\nany such action as that. I advise him to keep out of any such thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such things will have to be found out before they can be punished,\"\r\nwas the Vacuum reply. \"They will have to find him before they can do\r\nanything to him. We will take care of him.\" \"Having in mind,\" said\r\nDistrict Attorney Quinby to the jury, \"what happened afterwards--that\r\nthey should spirit him away.\"\r\n\r\n\"The suggestion is altogether wrong,\" persisted the lawyer. \"The action\r\nwould certainly be very hazardous as well as wrong.\"\r\n\r\nOn leaving, the elder of the two, evidently persisting in his plan,\r\nsaid to the lawyer, \"If you want to communicate with Albert, you can do\r\nso through C.M.\"[462]--his son.\r\n\r\nThese men were too careless to note that the lawyer they were talking\r\nto was not their lawyer, but Albert's. When they were brought to trial\r\nfor the crime that followed, and Albert, repentant, told the truth,\r\nthe lawyer was free to testify against them. \"I am entirely willing,\"\r\nsaid Albert in court, \"that Mr. George Truesdale shall state what took\r\nplace. I withdraw any legal objections I might have.\"\r\n\r\nThe accident which has let us see how the employés of a trust coolly\r\ndebated with lawyers the policy of blowing up a competitor's works,\r\nis one of the few glimpses the American public will ever get into the\r\nrelations of great legal lights and law-reformers with the mighty\r\ncapitalists who wreck railroads and execute wholesale corruption of\r\ncourts, legislatures, and trustees, and evade and transgress the laws\r\nwith the sure march of those who know that indictments and bail-bonds\r\nand verdicts of \"guilty\" and the penitentiary are only for men not\r\nrich enough to plan crime \"by advice of counsel.\" When such men went\r\nmarauding through the treasury of a great railroad and the courts of\r\nan Empire State, we saw the greatest of law-reformers, with a host\r\nof legal luminaries, picketing and scouting for them. Every sound in\r\nnature is phonographed somewhere, as its waves strike, and Judgment Day\r\nwill be rich with the revelations from these invisible rolls of the\r\nconfidential conversations between \"trustees\" and counsel, who are not\r\nhonorable lawyers as George Truesdale was, prostituting their functions\r\nas \"officers of courts\" into those of officers of crime.\r\n\r\nAll these trips from Buffalo to Rochester for these interviews made bad\r\nbreaks in the construction of the works of the new company at Buffalo.\r\nThe partners, who were wholly dependent upon Albert's knowledge and\r\nexperience for the building of the refinery, and running it when built,\r\nwere mystified and alarmed. Time and again he ran away without a word\r\nto them, and all work would stop until he came back. When he was on\r\nhand his task did not prosper as if his heart were still in it. When\r\none of the three stills of the refinery had been set up ready for use,\r\nand before any oil was run, Albert went up to Rochester again. At this\r\nrendezvous the sinister suggestion of \"doing something\" was repeated.\r\n\"You go back to Buffalo and construct the pipes and stills so that they\r\ncannot make good oil, and then if you would give them a little scare\r\n... they not knowing anything about the business ... you know how to\r\ndo it.\" Swearing he would not consent, but already succumbing to this\r\ntemptation, as he had given way to the threat of ruin, he replied as\r\nbefore: \"I don't propose to do anything to make myself criminally\r\nliable.\"[463] At their suggestion he took a man they sent all through\r\nthe new works, showing him how the stills had been constructed, how the\r\noil was to be made, and all the details of the refinery.[464]\r\n\r\nThe day came at last--long expected, delayed by these unaccountable\r\nabsences--when the members of the new company were to have the\r\nhappiness of seeing their enterprise set going. The one still that\r\nwas ready was filled with crude oil. The morning of the start Albert\r\nweighted down the safety-valve with heavy iron, and packed it with\r\nplaster of Paris. \"Fire this still,\" he said to his fireman, \"as heavy\r\nas you possibly can.\" The fireman did as he was ordered. During the\r\nforenoon Albert came to him. \"Damn it!\" he said, \"you ain't firing this\r\nstill half. Fire this still! I want you to fire this still! You ain't\r\ngot no fire under it!\" He took the shovel himself and threw some coal\r\nin, although there was, as the fireman expressed it, \"an inordinary\r\nfire.\" The fire-box grew cherry red.[465]\r\n\r\nAlbert knew well enough what the next chapter in the history of his\r\nassociates was likely to be. He had carried a dark-lantern into the\r\nstill-room one day when he was superintendent of the Vacuum. \"I was\r\nbadly burned by the explosion,\" he testified before the coroner's jury\r\ninvestigating the explosion in Rochester, in 1887. There were four\r\nexplosions in the Vacuum works while he was there. In the second, four\r\nmen were burned. As one of them ran to get water, with his clothes\r\nburning, he set fire to the gas coming out of the sewer. Flames flashed\r\nall about him. \"There's hell all around!\" he exclaimed. The third\r\nexplosion came from an overheated condensing-pipe, and destroyed one of\r\nthe buildings. The fourth burned up three tanks. Remembering all this,\r\nhe now took himself off to the grounds of the Atlas Company, out of\r\nharm's reach. The brickwork about the still cracked apart with the heat.\r\n\r\nBut the \"smash-up or something\" had not been thoroughly arranged.\r\nDespite the heavy weight and the packing of plaster, the safety-valve\r\nlifted itself under the unusual pressure, and was a safety-valve yet.\r\nIt was blown open, and a large mass of vapor rose and spread. This\r\nwas the real accident: that the safety-valve broke loose instead of\r\nkeeping the gases in to explode, as had been planned. The spreading\r\nvapor was not steam, as that had not been admitted to the still, but\r\nthe gas of distilling petroleum, as inflammable as gunpowder. There was\r\ndanger still, as great almost as that of explosion. A spark of fire,\r\nand it would have wrapped all within its reach in flames. The boiler\r\nfires were but twenty feet distant; not far from them the distilled oil\r\nwas being gathered in the \"tail-house\"; near the tail-house stood the\r\ntanks of crude oil, hundreds of barrels of the fuel that conflagration\r\nloves--the kind of fuel the cooks use who, beginning with kerosene for\r\nkindling, make the whole house into a stove, and cook themselves and\r\nthe family with the breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe kindly wind of a June day carried the cloud of gas away from the\r\nfire until it passed out of sight. The unsuspecting, inexperienced\r\nmen, whose lives and property had been at the mercy of explosion, knew\r\nnothing of their peril until years afterwards. The worst they knew\r\nthen was that the \"batch\" of 200 barrels of petroleum was spoiled,\r\nand that Albert, the only practical man among them, was gone, leaving\r\nthem crippled for a year. They waited for him, but he did not come.\r\nThey looked for him, but could not find him. Matthews went to the\r\ndepot night after night, sometimes at midnight, or later, to watch the\r\ntrains, but Albert never came.\r\n\r\n\"What would be the consequences?\" Albert was asked afterwards in court,\r\nwhen he was telling about \"the pretty heavy fires\" he had made under\r\nthe still--\"what would be the consequences in case too hot fires were\r\napplied, and the gas should blow off the pipes and become ignited?\"\r\n\r\n\"The consequences would be that, if ignited, there would be a\r\nfire.\"[466]\r\n\r\nAn Associated Press despatch from Louisville, Kentucky, June 30, 1890,\r\ndescribing an explosion in an oil refinery there, and the \"five acres\r\nof fire\" that followed, reproduces for us the picture which it had been\r\nplanned to paint at Buffalo as part of the panorama of \"the ordinary\r\nrules of supply and demand.\" A tank-car had been opened to run some oil\r\nout. As the workmen lifted the cap from the manhead of the tank a cloud\r\nof gas poured forth. It had been generated simply by the heat of the\r\nsummer sun, without the aid of an \"inordinary\" hot fire. The men jumped\r\nand ran. Before they had taken a dozen steps the vapor, spreading over\r\nthe ground and moving with the wind, had reached one of the sheds near\r\nby in which there was a fire. There was a flash. The men were bathed in\r\na lake of fire. They ran with the flames streaming from them. At the\r\ninfirmary their bodies were found to be charred in spots, literally\r\nroasted alive, and the flesh dropped off as their clothing was removed.\r\nThree men died and several were injured.\r\n\r\nSeveral years after the Buffalo explosion, when those convicted for\r\ntheir part in it were fighting for stay of proceedings, new trial,\r\nanything to escape sentence, and were trying by every means in their\r\npower to impress upon the public the altogether innocent character of\r\nthe little incident at the works of their rival, something happened\r\nat their own works--the Vacuum in Rochester--which gave the people\r\nan appalling sense of the terrors of the new school of supply and\r\ndemand. Naphtha is one of the by-products of petroleum distillation,\r\nand is used by the gas companies in the manufacture of the greased\r\nair they furnish under the name of gas. The Vacuum Company were\r\nselling their naphtha to the Rochester Gas Company. It was delivered\r\nto the gas company through a pipe line. On the afternoon of December\r\n21, 1887, there was an explosion on Platt Street, Rochester, tearing\r\naway the pavement, shattering the basement of a building, and filling\r\nthe air with missiles. In a few seconds another explosion occurred\r\na short distance away, making a hole in the street several feet in\r\ndiameter, from which came large volumes of smoke and flame. A third\r\nand fourth \"bust-up\" rapidly followed, and then a fifth, in the\r\nClinton Flouring Mill, tearing away a considerable portion of the\r\nbuilding, blowing off the roof and upper stories of the Jefferson\r\nMill adjoining, and shattering the Washington Mill. The Jefferson and\r\nClinton and Washington mills were burned to the ground. People were\r\nkilled by flying débris, burned to death, smashed by falling walls,\r\ncrippled by jumping from the upper stories of factories and mills on\r\nfire. \"There is probably no chemical product,\" says Professor Joy, of\r\nColumbia College, \"which has occasioned the loss of so many lives and\r\nthe destruction of so much property as naphtha.... From its highly\r\nexplosive and inflammable nature it has proved little better in the\r\nhands of ignorant people than so much gunpowder.\"\r\n\r\n\"The counsel for the defence,\" said District Attorney Quinby, in\r\nsumming up the case before the jury, \"laughed at the idea of Matthews\r\nand his associates coming to Buffalo with a little money to compete.\r\nI congratulate him that instead of defending for conspiracy he is\r\nnot here to-day pleading for the defendants' lives. If a person had\r\nbeen killed, and it had been under the advice and instruction of his\r\nclients, he would have been differently situated from what he is\r\nto-day. How well you men may be thankful that the gases from this still\r\ndid not flow down and, becoming ignited, explode and kill the fireman!\r\nYou ought to get down on your knees and thank your God that Providence\r\nprevented any such terrible thing as that for you.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the \"bust-up\" had been planned, and before it was done, one of\r\nthe Vacuum managers went to New York, where the \"trustees\" for whom\r\nhe was managing the company were. After the \"bust-up\" Albert heard by\r\ntelegram from New York, as had been arranged, and went to meet his\r\nold employer. \"What do you say to going down to Boston?\" he was asked\r\non his arrival. Later a man came in and was introduced by the name\r\nof one of the three trustees who purchased and directed the Vacuum.\r\nOn leaving, this \"trustee\" said: \"I will see you again if you do not\r\ngo to Boston.\" He thus showed that he knew of the plan that Albert\r\nshould be taken away, and that they should go to Boston. The manager\r\nof the Vacuum now gave the world a genuine illustration of the harmony\r\nof labor and capital. He couldn't let Albert out of his sight. They\r\nwent to Boston on the Fall River boat. The representative of a hundred\r\nmillions took the laborer into his own state-room, and at Boston\r\ncarried him into the splendors of Young's Hotel, where he registered,\r\nnaming himself \"and friend,\" and they shared one bedroom. They went to\r\nchurch together, and to Nantasket Beach, his friend introducing Albert\r\nto those whom they met under an assumed name. \"You don't want to be\r\nknown here,\" he said, \"and I will introduce you by the name of Milner.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the name I was known by while I was there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Albert has nothing to fear,\" said District Attorney Quinby on his\r\ntrial. \"He had never been in Boston before in his life. He had no\r\nacquaintance there. There was no reason why he should be registered\r\n'and friend' at the hotel. There was no reason, so far as he was\r\nconcerned, that he should be introduced under a fictitious name, except\r\nthat his employer had been schooled in the wonderful university known\r\nas\" the oil combination. In Boston, on a Monday, on the Common, within\r\nsight of the equestrian statue of the Father of his Country, his former\r\nemployer made a contract with Albert to pay him $1500 a year for doing\r\nnothing except staying away from Buffalo.\r\n\r\n\"You won't have much to do, and you can stay here in Boston, and keep\r\naway from those fellows, and we will protect you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's going to make up if those fellows come on and sue me for\r\ndamages? Who will make up this loss that I have been going to by\r\nsacrificing my property?\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave that to me; I will fix that all right. You do just as I tell\r\nyou, and you will come out all right.... Go wherever you like, stop\r\nwhere you like, and we will pay all your expenses while you are\r\nhere.\"[467]\r\n\r\nAlbert loafed about Boston several weeks, sometimes helping to roll\r\na barrel of oil in the Vacuum's store. When he wanted money he asked\r\nfor it and got it. He had once been a hard drinker. Destruction was\r\nas carelessly invited upon the soul of a poor brother as upon the\r\nlives and property of competitors. He hung around Boston and Rochester\r\nnearly a year. Then his old employer, who was in California, sent for\r\nhim to come there to help in a fruit cannery, his salary continuing\r\nas before. From the moment he deserted his partners, as Judge Edward\r\nHatch, the counsel for Matthews, stated in the civil suit for damages\r\nin this conspiracy, Albert \"never earned enough to cover the end of\r\nyour knife-blade with salt at your dinner. But they pay him, in salary\r\nand bonus, over $4000. Why? To get him away, and to stifle lawful,\r\nlegitimate, and honest competition; to stifle that which brings into\r\nevery poor man's home an article of necessity at a cheaper rate.\"\r\nHe stayed in California a few months, and, finally, sickened of the\r\ndisgraceful part he was playing, turned at bay, and gave notice that\r\nhe was going to leave. \"This is kind of sudden,\" the agent of his\r\nemployers replied, but said he would write to the principal director in\r\nNew York and advise that he release him. \"You will give me time, won't\r\nyou? You know it takes a couple of weeks or longer to do business from\r\nhere to New York.\" Albert waited, and in time the word came from New\r\nYork. \"I have heard from these parties, and they are willing to release\r\nyou.\"[468]\r\n\r\nAlbert, who had put himself into the extraordinary position in which\r\nhe was on the repeated pledges of the tempters that they would make it\r\n\"all right\" with him, and protect him from loss and harm, found that\r\nhe had put his \"trust in princes.\" When he came to settle he expected\r\nthat those for whom he had sacrificed his honor, his property, and his\r\ncareer would make him some compensation. In answer to the question how\r\nmuch they ought to make up to him, he named $5000 or $10,000, which\r\nwas certainly little enough, in view of the fact that the business\r\nhe had sacrificed to them was one in which, as the Vacuum's career\r\nshowed, $100 shares came to be worth $2666 each. But the representative\r\nof the trust declared he could not think of such a thing, and in full\r\nof all obligations gave him nothing but the balance due of the wages\r\nagreed on. Then he asked Albert to hold himself still further at their\r\nservice. As they parted, he said: \"Now we have settled up; now we are\r\ngood friends.... If anything ever comes up in this matter I would like\r\nto have you stand by us.... We will see that you are paid all right,\r\nand give you $25 a day while we need your services.\" Albert replied\r\nthat he did not feel under any obligations to the oil combination.\r\n\"I do not know as my interest lays that way. I do not think I shall\r\ndo anything to benefit them; they have injured me all that they can;\r\nthey have switched me all around, all over the country; they have got\r\nme out of employ, not given me anything to do, which I sought to have\r\nthem do. I do not think they have used me right, and I have sacrificed\r\nconsiderable money by this transaction, and you have always promised\r\nthat it would be made good, and you have not done so.\"[469]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE WOMAN'S EYES\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthews knew nothing and suspected nothing about the worst part of\r\nthe plot against him until Albert's lawyer, Mr. Truesdale, nearly four\r\nyears later, was called upon to testify in the suit Matthews brought\r\nfor damages against the Vacuum people. This suit was to recover from\r\nthem for having enticed Albert away, and having persecuted Matthews\r\nwith false and malicious suits; but Truesdale's evidence at once\r\nrevealed that there had been a deeper damnation still in the conspiracy\r\nagainst him. Mr. Matthews, one day on the street in Buffalo, ran across\r\nAlbert, who had just come back from California.\r\n\r\n\"No man ever used another meaner than I have you,\" said the now\r\nrepentant man to him, volunteering all the information he had,\r\nand agreeing to testify if called on. This revelation made the\r\nfarmer-refiner a reformer. This was the public's business. If such\r\nthings could be plotted and done with impunity by one man against\r\nanother, there was an end forthwith of every liberty the republic\r\nboasted. Especially menacing was such a conspiracy when concerted by\r\nthe rich fanatic of business against the poorer citizen to prevent\r\nthe latter from disputing the claim that a great market was a private\r\npreserve, and that the right to trade in it is a privilege which\r\n\"belongs to us.\"[470] Matthews could have used his discovery as an\r\nirresistible weapon to force his enemy to his knees, but he laid his\r\nevidence before the district attorney. This official presented it to\r\nthe grand-jury, which found that the facts warranted indictments.\r\nWhen the first indictment was quashed on technical grounds a second\r\ngrand-jury, sifting the facts, agreed with the first that the accused\r\nshould be held to answer in the criminal courts. This was six years\r\nafter the crime. The five persons indicted were the two former owners\r\nof the Vacuum, now the resident managers of it for the combination,\r\nand the three members of the oil trust, as the combination then called\r\nitself, who had bought the Vacuum for it, and had been elected by the\r\ntrustees directors to manage it for them, and had so managed it even\r\nto the most picayune details. The case caught the ears of the world,\r\nnot because crime was charged against men who had dazzled even the\r\ngold-filmed eyes of their epoch by the meteor-like flash of their\r\nflight from poverty into a larger share of \"property\"--the property\r\nof others--than any other group of millionaires had assimilated in an\r\nequal period; not for that, but because the charges of crime against\r\nthese quickest-richest men were to be brought to trial. Members of the\r\ncombination had been often accused; they had been indicted. This was\r\nthe first time, as District Attorney Quinby said in his speech to the\r\njury, that they had found a citizen honest enough and brave enough to\r\nstand up against them--the only one. \"There is no man,\" he said, \"so\r\nrespected to-day in Buffalo as he for the method he has used to bring\r\nthese men to justice.\" He succeeded in doing alone what the united\r\nproducers of the oil regions failed to do, although their resources\r\nwere infinitely greater. The people of the entire oil country failed\r\nutterly to do so much as get the members of the oil combination, when\r\nindicted for conspiracy in 1879, to come into court to be tried. All\r\nits principal men were indicted--the president, the vice-president,\r\nthe secretary, the cashier, and others. They could not even be got to\r\ngive bail. One of them had said when the indictments were found, that\r\nthe case would never be tried, and it never has been. The Governor\r\nwould not move to have those of the accused who were non-residents\r\nextradited, as he would have done, does daily, in the case of poor\r\nmen, and the courts so tangled up the questions of procedure that the\r\npeople withdrew, and left the indictments, as they remain to this day,\r\non file in the Clarion County court, swinging like the body of some\r\nmartyr on a road-side gibbet in the pagan days, polluting the air and\r\nmocking justice.[471]\r\n\r\nThat the trust was thoroughly alarmed, and saw the necessity of\r\nrallying all its resources to save itself, was apparent from the\r\nformidable display with which it appeared in the court-room. Present\r\nwith the five defendants, as if also on trial--a solid phalanx--were\r\nits president, the vice-president, the manager of its pipe-line system,\r\nthe principal representatives of the trust in Buffalo, and many others.\r\nTheir regular attorney of New York was present with two of the leading\r\nlawyers of Buffalo. Besides these there was a distinguished man from\r\nRochester, reputed the ablest lawyer in western New York, whose voice\r\nis often heard in the Supreme Court at Washington. He had two important\r\nmembers of the Rochester bar as assistants, one of them in the summing\r\nup unmercifully scored by the District Attorney for fixing witnesses;\r\nand, not least, a well-known United States District Attorney, who made\r\nthe convention speeches by which a distinguished citizen of Buffalo\r\nwas nominated, successively and successfully, for Sheriff, Mayor,\r\nGovernor, and President. The defendants come here, said the people's\r\nattorney, with the best legal talent the country affords, the best\r\nthe profession can furnish; for the trust--\"they are practically the\r\ndefendants in this action--with its great wealth, has the choice of\r\nlegal talent.\" Other eminent lawyers were also consulted, but were not\r\npresent. Never was a weak defence made the most of with more skill\r\nthan these gentlemen exhibited upon the trial.... But great as was the\r\nability of the defence, Mr. George T. Quinby, the District Attorney,\r\nand his assistant, William L. Marcy, proved a match for them. Every\r\npolitical and moneyed influence that could be brought to bear was used\r\nto mislead the District Attorney, but all to no purpose. The jury\r\ncould see that the complainant, Charles B. Matthews, did not get the\r\nindictment to sell out, otherwise he would have sold it out and not\r\nhave insisted upon a trial. The fact that the case was on trial, at a\r\ncost of many thousands of dollars to the defendants, was conclusive\r\nupon that point. An emissary, trying to get Matthews to call off the\r\nDistrict Attorney and to hush up this criminal prosecution, said the\r\noil trust could \"give him anything, even to being governor of a Western\r\nterritory.\"[472] \"You will have a chance,\" Matthews told the District\r\nAttorney, \"to line the street from your house to the City Hall with\r\ngold bricks.\" But this public prosecutor had no price. He grasped the\r\nfull scope of this extraordinary case, which involved not only a crime\r\nagainst persons and against the people, but against that true commerce\r\nof reciprocal and equal service on which alone the new civilization of\r\nhumanity can rest.\r\n\r\nThe room in the Buffalo court-house, where the case was being heard,\r\nwas bright with the sunshine of a May day, putting out the shadows of\r\nindictments and verdicts lurking in corners and pigeon-holes. Although\r\nit was a criminal case, the on-looker saw, strange as it seemed, that\r\nwhatever strain there was in the situation appeared to be felt least\r\nby the accused, and most by the public and the jury. The nearer the\r\neyes of the on-looker travelled towards the prisoners, the lighter\r\nand brighter was the scene. Close to the accused sat a bench full of\r\nnotables, evidently friends lending moral support. That the bench was\r\noccupied by men of importance was evident. They were supported by\r\nplatoons of eminent counsel and detectives. Only the judge betrayed\r\nno consciousness of the presence of the herd of millionaires. The\r\nwhisperings and pointings and namings by one spectator to another\r\nshowed that the people's curiosity was greatly excited by the\r\nsight of the richest men in the country, if not in the world, with\r\nattendant millionaire esquires in or about the dock of a criminal\r\ncourt. On this particular day the notables and their suite had come\r\nin specially good-humor. Nods of kindly recognition went about and\r\nsmiles rippled everywhere as, settled into their seats, they listened\r\nto the recital by the witnesses. It had been as good as a play to hear\r\nthe working-man, Albert, tell on the stand how he had been bribed and\r\nthreatened with ruin until he yielded to the suggestion that he should\r\n\"bust up\" the works of his friends, partners, and employers, and run\r\naway. There had been nothing funny to Albert in those threats: \"We will\r\nruin you,\" \"We will crush you,\" \"You will lose what little you have got\r\nleft.\"[473]\r\n\r\n\"Then the compensation you got was $300 and the pleasure of selling\r\nout your friends?\" Albert was asked by one of the great lawyers.[474]\r\nAlbert did not smile, but \"they seemed to enjoy hugely,\" reported\r\nthe press, \"the idea that men could be bought so cheap.\" The eminent\r\ncounsel of the prisoners took the cue from their clients, and treated\r\nthe proceedings as a farce. When the State's Attorney was questioning\r\nhis witnesses, they objected to his questions with laughs and sneers\r\nuntil he became indignant, and asked, with considerable emphasis, to\r\nhave the joke explained to him--a need the jury also felt, as their\r\nverdict showed. When the Boston agent of the trust told that his\r\ninstructions from headquarters were that if there was to be any selling\r\nat a loss to let the new competitor have the loss,[475] they all\r\nlaughed again.\r\n\r\nSo all the morning there had been fine sport in the court-room, and\r\nthe good-humor had risen higher with every fresh incident in the\r\nentertainment until Albert's wife took her place in the witness-box.\r\nShe, too, raised a laugh, but it was not she who laughed. Serious\r\nenough she was when taking her place on the witness-stand. She had to\r\nface these gentlemen, before whose hundreds of millions her husband's\r\nlittle venture had withered, but, as she herself afterwards said: \"I\r\nwasn't afraid of them, but I was nervous. But as soon as I got talking\r\nI didn't care anything for them, although they all sat there in front,\r\nin a row, looking straight at me.\"\r\n\r\nThe wife's story to the jury showed how such an adventure appeared\r\nwhen looked at and experienced from the woman's stand-point--the\r\nhome-maker's and the home-keeper's--which the smiling row before her\r\nwere as little able to grasp as the participants in a pigeon-shooting\r\nmatch to look upon that vision of flames, demons, and death-dealing\r\nthunder from the point of view of the hapless birds. A bright-faced,\r\nbrown-eyed, pleasant-looking woman, as she took the stand she looked\r\nwhat she was--an artisan's honest wife. \"My husband,\" she said, \"had\r\nbeen employed in the Vacuum oil works at Rochester thirteen or fourteen\r\nyears, and we had accumulated some property--mortgages and money\r\nand real estate. We moved to Buffalo, April 5, 1881, where he was\r\nsuperintending the building of the Buffalo works.\"[476] After Albert\r\nhad yielded to the threats and the temptation, and had fixed the stills\r\nand the fires for an explosion, he fled without a word to his wife\r\nor his associates, hid, under an assumed name, in Boston, and then\r\ntravelled over the continent for a year--from Buffalo to Boston, to\r\nRochester, to San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\"When you left Buffalo did you leave any word with Matthews where you\r\nwere going?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the wife was in Buffalo wondering what had become of her husband,\r\nhe was in New York with his venerable ex-employer, getting lessons\r\nlike the following in the secrets of building up a great commercial\r\nenterprise:\r\n\r\n\"The best thing you can do, Albert,\" said the latter, \"is to go and\r\nwrite a telegram, and tell your wife to go back to Rochester.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better write it; I am a poor writer,\" said Albert.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said; \"I do not want to appear in this case at all. Write it\r\nso,\" he continued, \"that she can move on the Fourth of July, and they\r\ncan't attach her things.\"[477]\r\n\r\nThe first word she got from her husband was this telegram to move\r\nbetween two days, and back to Rochester the dutiful woman packed\r\nherself and her things.\r\n\r\n\"It was two or three weeks before I heard from him direct or knew just\r\nwhere he was,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I asked Charles\"--one of the two managers--\"how Al was, and he said Al\r\nwas all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would he tell you where he was?\" the State's Attorney asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; when I wrote to my husband I left the direction blank, and\r\ngave the letter to Charley. I got an answer through Charley.\"[478]\r\n\r\nFor three weeks they would not let her know where her husband was.\r\n\"Think of that,\" said the District Attorney. \"She had to go and take\r\nher poor little letter to her husband, thinking, perhaps, if he was\r\naway from her tender care he might get to drinking, because he does\r\ndrink some; but when with his wife they lived year in and year out\r\nwithout his tasting a drop; ... afraid that he might get to drinking,\r\nand that she could not watch over him.... It was a cruel thing to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"C. told me to go to the real-estate agents,\" Albert's wife continued,\r\n\"and try to sell our property and get it into money. He made out a list\r\nof real-estate agents from the city directory. I guess that is all he\r\ndid about assisting me in the sale of the property.\"\r\n\r\n\"I asked C. if my husband could not come home from Boston. I was sick.\r\nHe said 'Yes.' Al came home and stayed a week or two. Then he went back\r\nto Boston. C. told me they did not want the Buffalo company to know\r\nwhere Al was.\"[479]\r\n\r\nAlbert was a man infirm under temptation. The employer knew, by\r\nfourteen years' acquaintance, the weakness this man had acquired in his\r\nservice in the army. He gave him idleness, money, temptation, and an\r\nassumed name to go to the devil with, if that agent of the trust was to\r\nbe found in Boston.\r\n\r\n\"You want to take good care of Al,\" said the good old man to his clerk\r\nin Boston, \"and not let him get homesick. If he wants any money, let\r\nhim have it.\" Albert travelled the broad way made smooth for him.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I never went around with him,\" said the clerk, in a\r\ndeposition; \"a porter that I had was the party that went around with\r\nhim in the evening. I would hear what was going on, and I could judge\r\nabout the size of Al's head when he came around in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nWith all Albert's faults he kept one dignity to the end which makes\r\nhim tower above his seducers--the dignity of the laborer. A life's\r\ndiscipline in daily toil had made his whole fibre too honest to enjoy\r\nidleness, even at the rate of $1500 a year. He was free to come and go\r\namid the gaudy joys of a great city, as irresponsible under the assumed\r\nname given him as if he wore the ring of Gyges. He had money for the\r\nasking, and boon companions. But the habit of a lifetime of honest,\r\nhard manual work was too deeply ingrained into the very substance of\r\nhis nature for him to become a cheap American Faust, revelling in\r\na pinchbeck paradise. This simple son of poverty had all his life\r\nhandled only real things, and had at every point had the mind's native\r\nwantonness and riot checked by the hard surface which had calloused\r\nhis hands, and the outer air which had cooled him as he worked. His\r\nwere dreams of honest rest earned by honest work, and of family joys.\r\nThe self-indulgence that was revealed by the \"size of his head in the\r\nmorning\" was an animal exuberance that, as the result showed, did but\r\nstain the \"rose-mesh of his flesh,\" and went no deeper. Albert could\r\nnot stand the idleness of his Boston life. He went back to Rochester.\r\n\r\n\"I want something to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What brings you here?\" said his employer. \"Go back.\"\r\n\r\nAfter hanging around the office in Boston a few weeks longer, the\r\nworkman's nature reasserted itself again. He went back again to\r\nRochester. \"I want something to do.\" \"We have not got anything for you\r\nto do just now,\" he was told. \"You are all right.\"[480]\r\n\r\nMonths of idleness were interrupted only by odd jobs, like\r\nsuperintending the digging of a ditch or the sinking of a salt-well.\r\nTime and again, though he was drawing his pay of $125 a month, he went,\r\nas he told the story in court, to repeat the plea for \"something to\r\ndo.\" Finally, the elder of the managers, who was in California, sent\r\nfor him. He was to be made \"an independent man,\" the new promise ran,\r\nbut really, as the sequel showed, was, if possible, to be kept out of\r\nthe way of too inquisitive juries and prosecuting attorneys. The wife,\r\ntreated as a mere pawn in the game, protested vehemently. \"I went down\r\nto the Vacuum Oil Company's office, and asked C. to give Al something\r\nelse to do. I didn't want him to go to California. He said that there\r\nwas not anything that he knew that he could do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want Al to go. I won't go. Give him something else to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing else.\"[481]\r\n\r\nShe had to yield, and her husband left her to go to California. His\r\nemployer persuaded Albert to buy a piece of land in California. \"He\r\nseemed to be very anxious to locate me there.\"[482] Albert sent to\r\nhis wife for the money, but the shrewd little woman sent only half.\r\n\"I thought I would let him pay it out of his pay.\" With the same good\r\nsense the wife had not sold all the property when sent out alone among\r\nthe real-estate men. \"I did not sell the real estate,\" she said; \"I\r\nthought there was too much expense.\"[483] She was not with her husband\r\nwhen the rupture came in California. The first news the anxious wife\r\nhad of a change in her husband's affairs was when \"Charley\" came to\r\nher, as she was sitting one summer evening on the porch of a neighbor's\r\nhouse, and told her \"Al\" had quit them. \"I do not know what to make of\r\nit,\" he continued: \"I think he must be crazy or something.\"[484]\r\n\r\nIt was not until his return that she learned the details of the painful\r\nexperience he had been through. When it was heard that Albert, upon\r\nhis return from California, had made restitution as far as he was able,\r\nby telling what he knew to the authorities, to aid them in bringing\r\nthe principals in the crime to justice, there was consternation in the\r\ntrust. One of its detectives had been captain of the company Albert\r\nwas in during the Civil War. The captain now presented himself before\r\nAlbert as he went to his work in Corry, Pennsylvania, where he had\r\ngone after his return from California, and became sociable rapidly.\r\nHe had great plans for Albert, and came to the house to discuss them\r\nconfidentially. Albert and his wife had been simple folks to start\r\nwith, but they had learned a thing or two by this time. The captain's\r\ndesire for confidential talk with his old comrade was so intense that\r\nit would have been rude in Albert's wife to thwart it. She packed off\r\nher daughter on an errand, and announced that she had a call up the\r\nstreet, and would leave them to themselves; but she did not add, as she\r\nmight have done, that during her absence she would be represented by\r\nthe Chief of Police, whose appetite for confidential communications was\r\nas keen as the captain's, but whose retiring disposition kept him in\r\nthe dark seclusion of an adjoining room, with his ear to the crack of\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't Albert like to go to Russia?\" the captain asked his dear\r\nfriend the private, whose existence he had never personally recognized\r\nwhen they were so close together during the Civil War. \"If the Court\r\nwill allow me to show by this witness,\" said the prosecuting attorney,\r\n\"that the captain came there as a detective for the oil trust, and made\r\na proposition, after the indictments were found, to Albert to flee the\r\ncountry, and go with him to Russia.\" One of the army of trust lawyers\r\nwas instantly on his feet with \"I object.\" The judge sustained him, and\r\nthe testimony was shut out.\r\n\r\nAlbert's wife kept close to his side, and held him steady. No, Albert\r\ndid not care to go to Russia. Advertisements of an alum-mine in Corry\r\nthen began to appear in newspapers where Albert's attention could\r\nbe called to them. By a lucky chance the captain happened to know\r\nthe capitalists whose boundless powers of enterprise could find\r\nfull outlet only by developing the hitherto unsuspected resources of\r\nCorry for supplying the nations of the earth with alum. By a joyful\r\ncoincidence, these capitalists wanted for superintendent of their\r\nbottomless alum-mines just such a man as the captain knew his dear\r\nAlbert to be. Would Albert like to go to Italy to learn the true\r\nscience of alum manufacture, and to show the effete monarchies how\r\nan American could disembowel the earth of its alum? Salary, $5000\r\nand expenses. No, Albert had no unslaked ambition to go to Italy as\r\nsuperintendent of mines of alum, or green cheese, or any other lunar\r\ncommodity.\r\n\r\nAt least, Albert would take a drink? That poor Albert would do; and\r\nwhen he failed to come home at night his wife went up and down the\r\nstreets seeking him. \"A persistent effort had been made\" by the trust,\r\nMr. Matthews testified, \"to get Albert out of the country. I was afraid\r\nthey would get him away, as he might not be used in this case. Men\r\nhad been sent there to get him drunk, and had debauched him.\"[485]\r\nMoney was potent enough to persuade lawyers to make it a part of their\r\nprofessional duty to help in this. One of the trust's lawyers sat with\r\nAlbert and its detective in the stall of a cheap saloon, and plied him\r\nwith liquor to get from him some letters of Matthews' they wanted.\r\n\"There they sat,\" said the keeper of the saloon; \" ... they got what\r\nthey called for, probably.... I couldn't tell how many drinks they got\r\ninto Albert on that occasion; I think they drank there.\"[486]\r\n\r\nWhile this courtship was in progress with Albert in Pennsylvania, wires\r\nwere being pulled to get him indicted in New York. The grand-jury of\r\nRochester was asked to indict him for receiving stolen property in a\r\nwatch trade he had made seven years before. This would have ruined him\r\nas a witness in the forthcoming criminal case against the members of\r\nthe oil trust, but the grand-jury decided that there was no evidence\r\non which to indict. When Adam Cleber, a stolid-looking German laborer,\r\nwho worked in the same place with Albert in Corry, took the stand for\r\nthe State at the close, an eager excitement filled the court-room.\r\nThe State's Attorney was known to have his darkest sensation still in\r\nreserve. What it was he would not, of course, disclose in advance, but\r\nthose hardly less familiar than he with the evidence hinted that the\r\nfertile genius of the captain, having exhausted itself in the ideas\r\nof the trips to Russia and Italy, had fallen back upon the genius of\r\nhis superiors, and had arranged to have Albert go a-hunting, and get\r\na \"bust-up\" as much as possible like the one he had been induced to\r\nattempt upon his employers and partners.\r\n\r\n\"Did the captain tell you what he wanted you to do to Albert?\" Cleber\r\nwas asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--\" That was as far as Cleber got.\r\n\r\n\"I object!\" screamed one of the lawyers.\r\n\r\n\"I propose to show that the captain made a request of this witness in\r\nregard to what he should do to Albert, and what he should come and\r\nswear to about Albert, there being no truth in the matter he wanted\r\nCleber to swear to,\" the State's Attorney urged to the Court. The judge\r\ntook the matter home for consideration over-night, and announced in the\r\nmorning that he would not admit the evidence. It was acknowledged by\r\none of the lawyers for the members of the trust on trial that he had\r\nemployed the captain to get evidence for them; but the judge, instead\r\nof admitting Cleber's testimony, and leaving the question of its value\r\nto be settled by the jury, excluded it.\r\n\r\nIn his closing speech District Attorney Quinby said: \"Why, in Heaven's\r\nname, my friends, didn't you place the captain on this witness-stand?\r\nHe would have been a feast for you and a feast for me. His ways\r\nhave been curious and sinuous, his methods have been peculiar and\r\ncorrupting, and they did not dare to put him on the stand because if\r\nthey did he would have left it to go to prison. That is the reason.\r\nThey know it.\"\r\n\r\nThe brave and steadfast woman told her part of this story on the\r\nwitness-stand. Her home had been broken up again and again. As she\r\nherself said afterwards: \"I had to live with my carpets packed, and\r\nmoved around like a gypsy.\" Her husband had been tempted to commit a\r\ncrime which compelled him to lead the life of a fugitive. He had been\r\nspirited away and secreted; she had not been allowed to know where\r\nhe was, and could communicate with him only through a third person;\r\nthey had moved around, in her expressive phrase, until they had moved\r\ninto two rooms; the savings of fifteen years' hard work were all gone,\r\nand the independent business, in which her husband had just got his\r\nfooting, swept away. He and she faced the world with no other assets\r\nthan their child and the palms of their hard-working hands.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's taken all we had,\" she says; \"we've lost it all, but I'd\r\nrather it would be so than to have the money they have, and go about\r\nhiding and sneaking. I'd like money, but not so well as that. When I\r\nsaid to 'Charley,' 'I shall have to sell all my furniture'--'Oh, that's\r\nnothing.' And when I told him it had cost us $100 to pay the expenses\r\nof selling real estate--'That isn't much.' It wasn't much to them, but\r\nit was to us, who had made every dollar by hard work. Well, we'll have\r\nto do without the money, and just live along by honest work. We can\r\nlive that way. We have had all this trouble and lost our money, and\r\nhaven't made money enough to buy a calico dress.\"\r\n\r\nAll the good that had come of this loss of savings and home and honor\r\nhad gone to those at the bar of justice and their associates sitting\r\nin the tickled row before her. On the cross-examination, which was\r\nto crush the witness and her damaging testimony, the distinguished\r\ncounsel, not content with all the suffering and loss already inflicted\r\non this wife, tried to humiliate her still further, but the woman's wit\r\nof truth was too much for the lawyer's wit of wile.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you recollect,\" the lawyer asked, \"that you went to the house\r\nof the manager of the Vacuum, and that you saw him in the parlor, and\r\nthat you asked him to take your husband back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never asked him to take my husband back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you did not ask him at the time and place I spoke of?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never asked him anywhere to take him back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you recollect upon that occasion being considerably affected,\r\nand asking him to take your husband back, and his speaking of the way\r\nin which he had left the company, which he characterized as shameful,\r\nand that you cried--shed tears?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never asked him to take him back. I recollect going there. I\r\nrecollect I felt bad, because I was talked to so much about it. I had\r\nreason to feel bad. I am trying to tell the truth as near as I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what was the occasion of your bad feeling?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was because I thought we were going to lose everything, and would\r\nnot have nothing left. That is what I felt bad for--was shedding tears\r\nfor, if I did. I don't know as I did.\"[487]\r\n\r\nThen came the laugh. From millionaire to lesser millionaire went\r\nthe enlarging laugh. The mighty cortege of the retained ex-judges,\r\nfamous constitutional and criminal lawyers, detectives, camp-followers\r\nlaughed. It was the laugh of hundreds of millions, and it clinked and\r\ntinkled and rang. As if every mouth were a bagful of gold, and as if\r\nevery bag had burst, the golden notes of mirth filled the air, and\r\nstruck the ceiling, and rolled over the floor, rebounded and fell and\r\nrose in mellow chimes of sound, and the golden rain dripped everywhere.\r\nMillions on millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of the\r\ncoin of the republic, and in every coin a cackle.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they all laughed at me,\" the little woman told her friends; \"it\r\nlooked like such a great joke to them. Perhaps I did not tell it very\r\nwell, but I told the truth.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing the case the State's Attorney said to the jury: \"A sorrow\r\nwas placed on that woman's heart that can never be removed. One of the\r\npathetic things in this case was that when this woman was on the stand,\r\ntelling her little story, how they were afraid they might lose the\r\nfew thousand dollars they had saved, the $6000 or $7000 they had been\r\nstruggling for for fifteen years, these New York gentlemen with their\r\nmillions laughed in her face at the idea of her being sorry to lose the\r\npittance of $6000 or $7000. It was the only time in the case, really, I\r\nfelt that these gentlemen were outraging common decency.\"[488]\r\n\r\nSome time after the trial was over, and sentence passed and satisfied,\r\nthese men sent for Albert to come to Rochester. He went with witnesses.\r\nThere in the office of a leading lawyer he was tempted with desperate\r\npropositions to do something or say something that would break the\r\nforce with which these disclosures must act on public opinion. \"They\r\nneed not think,\" he replied, \"that they can get me to make a false\r\noath to let them out of a hole. I would not do it for all the combined\r\nwealth of the trust. When my wife was on the stand they laughed her\r\nin the face when she told about losing all we had. Do you suppose any\r\nman with a particle of American blood could have any love for them? I\r\nthink as much of my wife and daughter as any of them of theirs, and I\r\nwill do nothing to disgrace them.\" This hard-working and hard-living\r\nlaborer and his wife had, by thirteen or fourteen years of toil and\r\nstinting, saved $6000. The laughers had in the same time saved about\r\n$300,000,000, and somebody else had done all the work. The poor man and\r\nhis wife had been afraid that the $300,000,000 would devour the $6000.\r\nIt said it would, and it had. Shall not they laugh who win?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTAKEN FROM THE JURY BY THE JUDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe District Attorney put the president of the light of the world on\r\nthe stand. His evidence showed that the purchase of the three-quarter's\r\ninterest in the Vacuum Company, sold because \"there were restrictions\r\nin the shipments,\" was made by the three New York men on trial. \"They\r\nare share-holders in the trust,\" he said. When they bought the stock\r\nthey transferred it to the oil trust. He had known of the contemplated\r\npurchase. Having thus proved that the three indicted directors from\r\nNew York on trial were members of the oil trust, and were managing\r\nthe Vacuum for it, the District Attorney proceeded, in pursuance of a\r\nlogical plan of inquiry, to bring before the jury what the trust was,\r\nand its relations to the companies it covered.\r\n\r\n\"What is it ... if you know?\" the District Attorney asked. The\r\npresident, through his counsel, objected to the question.\r\n\r\n\"What is the object of this?\" the judge asked the District Attorney.\r\n\r\nThe trust, the District Attorney explained, owns a majority of the\r\nstock of this Vacuum Company and others, and controls the manufacture\r\nin this country of substantially all the lubricating and illuminating\r\noils. These defendants belonging to the trust, and \"one of these being\r\nchairman of a committee of the trust, it was the desire and motive\r\nof the three to do away with competition, to destroy and ruin the\r\ncompetitive works in Buffalo.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court asked the president of the trust if it was a manufacturing\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\"It is not, your honor.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court ruled out the question \"What is it?\" although in doing so he\r\nused language apparently contradicting his ruling, saying, in effect,\r\nthat it was \"quite immaterial what the objects or purposes of the oil\r\ntrust are, unless these defendants are in some way interested so as\r\nto create a motive to do what it is claimed they did do.\" Again, when\r\nthe District Attorney sought to ascertain in what other corporations\r\nengaged in the manufacture of oil in 1879, 1880, and 1881 the trustees\r\non trial owned stock, it was objected to and the objection sustained,\r\nalthough the Court but a few moments before had said, \"I will allow\r\nyou to show everything these defendants have done upon the question of\r\nmotive, ... to show what their business is, the companies they have\r\nstock in, whether it is an oil company or some other company--that\r\nis, any company engaged in the manufacture of oil that would come in\r\ncompetition with the Buffalo company....\"\r\n\r\nThe judge, declaring that he would admit such evidence, refused to\r\nadmit it. What the District Attorney would have been able to uncover\r\nas to the responsibility of the \"trustees\" for what was done by the\r\nsubordinate companies, the reader, freer than the jury in this case,\r\ncan find out for himself.\r\n\r\nThe nine trustees, of whom three were on trial, owned as their\r\nindividual property more than half of this as of every establishment in\r\nthe trust. They decided who were to be elected directors and officers\r\nof each company. They exercised full control over these officers\r\nwhen elected. They declared the dividends. The profits of all these\r\nshares are put into one purse, and distributed in quarterly dividends\r\namong the trustees in proportion to their interest in the trust--the\r\npurse-holder.[489] In the case of the Vacuum Company, accordingly, we\r\nfind that the minutes of stockholders' meetings record the presence\r\nof members of the oil trust, in person and by proxy, representing\r\na majority of the stock, electing the officers and directors, and\r\ndeclaring the dividends. How thorough and minute is the supervision\r\nover the vassal companies an employé, who had been in the service of\r\nthe combination for several years in a confidential way, and \"had\r\naccess to every book and paper and their cipher arrangement,\" has\r\ntold.[490] They \"control every movement of every branch of their\r\nbusiness.\" The subordinate companies \"make a report every day of all\r\ntheir business.... They have blanks there on which they make a report\r\nof all their shipments, where shipped, and who shipped to, and all\r\ntheir purchases; and they report every month the exact percentage they\r\nhave made out of their crude oil, of all the different products they\r\nget out of it. They report everything in detail.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in 1879. Ten years later, in 1888, the testimony of the\r\npresident shows that the system is the same. \"They know the cost at\r\nevery refinery. They get such reports once in thirty days; each report\r\nshows just what it has cost for everything.... Made out on regular\r\nblanks.\"[491]\r\n\r\nBut when put on the stand in this case, in Buffalo, he had professed\r\nhimself altogether ignorant of any such reports.[492] Asked if the\r\nVacuum Company had made them, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I can't recall any such reports.\"\r\n\r\nAsked if it was obligatory upon the Vacuum Oil Company to make reports,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"I can't state.\"\r\n\r\nBut the manager's testimony in the same case shows that the system of\r\nreports which his superior \"could not recall\" was in regular operation.\r\n\r\n\"There are reports of sales of the Vacuum Oil Company made to certain\r\nparties in New York.\"[493]\r\n\r\nThe three trustees who bought the control of the Vacuum stock did\r\nnot keep it for themselves. They transferred it to the trust, and\r\nreceived for it shares in the trust. They were not stockholders in\r\nthe Vacuum, but stockholders in the trust. It was the trust which was\r\nthe real stockholder in the Vacuum. The profits on this Vacuum stock,\r\ntherefore, went into the common fund in which the trust accumulated the\r\nprofits of all its controlling ownerships in companies all over the\r\ncountry--all over the world. Every trustee shared in the profits of\r\nevery company so controlled, whether in the United States or Europe or\r\nAsia. The president of the trust, now on the witness-stand, was a large\r\nparticipator in the profits of the Vacuum, because he was a large owner\r\nin the trust which possessed three-quarters of it. Similarly as to the\r\nthree trustees indicted and on trial, and every other trustee.[494]\r\nThe case was interwoven, notwithstanding the exclusion of this by the\r\njudge, with evidence that the three members of the trust on trial\r\nwere the managers of the company for the trust, and were consulted\r\nhabitually about the current details by the salaried agents.\r\n\r\n\"After this purchase was made did you continue to represent the\r\npurchasers in the management of the affairs of the Vacuum Oil Company?\"\r\none of the three was asked.\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the purchase of the Vacuum by the trust, Mr. Matthews, before he\r\nleft to go into business on his own account, had to go to its office\r\nin New York half a dozen times, to see the New York directors when he\r\nwanted instructions. His testimony on this point covers thirty pages of\r\nthe official testimony, and shows repeated interviews between him and\r\nthe members of the trust about every kind of detail of the business of\r\nthe Vacuum. When Matthews asked the manager of the Vacuum to give him\r\nmore pay, the latter had told him to speak to one of the trustees--one\r\nof the three now on trial. \"It will be as he says about it.\" Again, as\r\nto another matter, he said to Matthews: \"I cannot tell you. There is no\r\nuse for me to pretend that we run our business, for we do not.\"[495]\r\n\r\nThis evidence must be sought in the original records of the case at\r\nBuffalo, as it is left out in the transcript furnished by the trust to\r\nthe committee of Congress, which represents the case against the two\r\nlocal managers only. The Rochester manager, after the explosion, and at\r\nthe time of sending for Albert to come to New York, telegraphed to his\r\nson: \"Our views with regard to Albert confirmed.\" By whom? as Matthews'\r\nlawyer asked. The manager saw one of the three accused trustees in New\r\nYork after he returned from the trip to Boston to hide Albert. \"I told\r\nhim that I had hired him,\" he testified.\r\n\r\nThe trustee denied this, as the president denied the monthly reports.\r\nBut he has himself furnished the evidence that his employé told the\r\ntruth. In their answer in court to the allegations of the suit against\r\nthem for damages, he and the other two trustees concerned in the\r\nVacuum direction testified that they advised the Rochester managers\r\n\"to endeavor to retain the said\" Albert, ... \"and after\" he \"had left\r\nthe employment of the Vacuum Oil Company ... they further advised that\r\nhe should be re-employed if it could be done by reasonable increase of\r\nhis wages. They were afterwards informed that he had been re-employed.\"\r\nThis shows they knew about the negotiations before, during, and after.\r\nThey knew the man was to have more wages, though the increase was only\r\n$300 a year, and their income was millions yearly. When he had been\r\ngotten away they were informed of that too. The District Attorney knew\r\nall about this answer in the civil case, but under the statutes of New\r\nYork it could not be used in a criminal prosecution against those who\r\nhad made it. He put the trustee on the stand, and did his best to get\r\nhim to tell the same story, but in vain.\r\n\r\nThe body-guard of lawyers surrounding the great men who made the\r\ncourt-room a veritable curiosity-shop for the people of Buffalo, did\r\na deal of acting throughout the trial to impress on the jury that the\r\nwhole proceeding was a farce. They laughed and yawned and pooh-poohed,\r\nand sneered at the District Attorney's questions and points, and went\r\nthrough all kinds of dumb-shows of indignation and ennui that their\r\nclients should be so needlessly called on to waste priceless time. But\r\nthis could not prevent their faces from lengthening as the story was\r\ntold by witness after witness, as more than one observant reporter\r\nsaw and noted. When the evidence was all in, and District Attorney\r\nQuinby had closed his case, the situation was desperate. There was no\r\ndoubt about that. The great men of the trust on trial had been proved\r\nto be the actual directors of the Vacuum at every turn of its daily\r\naffairs. Before any evidence was introduced for the defence, one of\r\nthe distinguished lawyers arose and moved the discharge of the three\r\nmembers of the trust, who were a majority of the Board of Directors\r\nof the Vacuum Company, and managed it for the trust. The prosecution\r\nwere not taken unawares by the motion. The District Attorney's able\r\nassistant, William L. Marcy, had gathered all the precedents and\r\nequipped himself to resist the discharge. He and the District Attorney\r\nfought hard to have the principals in the company go to the jury with\r\ntheir agents, but in vain. Mr. Marcy pointed out that, as shown in the\r\ncase of The People _vs._ Mather, \"to charge partners as conspirators it\r\nis not necessary even to show that they were the original conspirators.\r\nIt is sufficient if at a subsequent time they become party to it by\r\naccepting the benefits derived from the conspiracy. The case lays that\r\ndown in exact terms.\"\r\n\r\nThe Judge: \"Must there not be an adoption?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Marcy: \"That is an adoption--accepting the benefits.\"\r\n\r\nThe Judge: \"They may accept the benefits without knowing.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Marcy: \"Then the jury may infer that knowledge from all the\r\ncircumstances. The jury are the tribunal to determine whether or not\r\nthe parties had the knowledge.\" Mr. Marcy pointed out that there was\r\neverything to lead the jury to infer that these men were parties to the\r\nplan. \"Where did the meetings of the Board of Directors take place?\r\nAt Rochester, where the works are? No; at New York, where these men\r\ncarried on their other business. The Rochester representatives dance\r\nin attendance wherever these New York parties desire them to go.\" He\r\npointed out to the judge that the trustee whom Albert met in New York\r\nafter the explosion knew of the plan to take him to Boston. He showed\r\nthat the same trustee, when remonstrated with by Matthews for bringing\r\npatent suits without foundation, said that he intended to carry them\r\non, and if he was beaten in one court, he would carry them to a higher\r\ncourt. Just in the same way the Rochester representative of the trust\r\nhad said: \"I will bring lawsuits against you. I will get an injunction\r\nagainst you.\" \"When the Rochester manager,\" said Mr. Marcy, \"hired\r\nAlbert, he did not pretend to be able to make a bargain until he had\r\nbeen to New York and consulted about it. He was in New York before he\r\ntelegraphed to him to come to New York. This significant fact points\r\nhome the conspiracy upon the gentlemen who reside in New York.\"\r\n\r\nBut the judge, and not the jury, rendered the verdict as to the three\r\nmembers of the trust on trial. He failed to remember or observe the law\r\nthat leaves it to the jury to render the verdict. He announced that he\r\nhad decided to grant the motion for their discharge. There was silence\r\nin the court-room for a moment. Then: \"Gentlemen of the jury, hearken\r\nto your verdict as advised by the Court,\" came in sonorous tones from\r\nthe clerk; \"you find the defendants\"--naming the three members of the\r\noil trust at the bar--\"not guilty of the crime, as charged in the\r\nindictment, so say you all.\"\r\n\r\nThe jury looked scared at being addressed so peremptorily, but said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"The New York men looked happy,\" said one of the observers, \"but\r\ntheir Rochester associates and codefendants did not smile.\" Upon the\r\ndischarge of the trustees, one of the Buffalo dailies said that whether\r\nthere was any conspiracy at all is an undecided question, but it should\r\nbe remembered that the oil trust and the Vacuum Oil Company \"have been\r\nhonorably acquitted of the charge of having anything to do with the\r\nmatter. As the case now stands, it is simply The People against\"--the\r\ntwo Rochester managers.\r\n\r\nPoor men! It was for this that they succumbed to the attacks of the\r\noil trustees upon their business, sold them for $200,000 three-quarters\r\nof a concern which produced $300,000 in dividends in one year for\r\nthe lucky conquerors, became vassals instead of masters in their own\r\nrefinery. It was for $10,000 a year, divided into $6500 for one and\r\n$3500 for the other, that they undertook to fetch and carry for their\r\nsuzerains, even to the gates of the penitentiary; and when discovery\r\nand conviction came, to bear in silence upon their own shoulders the\r\nguilt and shame from which others got only \"more.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial of the two remaining defendants proceeded. Neither of them\r\ntook the stand. In a deposition the elder said it was Albert who had\r\nspoken about misplacing the pipes; but when asked what he said in reply\r\nto a suggestion, which no one better than he knew the significance\r\nof, he replied: \"I made no reply to it, but I thought it would be a\r\nvery scandalous proceeding.\"[496] Albert had told how, in conversation\r\nin California, his employer had described his plans with regard to\r\nMatthews.\r\n\r\n\"We would have just got them fellows in a boat, right in the middle\r\nof the stream, and we would have tipped them two over, and drowned\r\nthem, and you would have been all right.\"[497] \"If I ever made such a\r\nremark,\" this defendant deposed, \"it was in a playful humor. I am in\r\nthe habit of making playful remarks.\"\r\n\r\nWitness after witness had to confess, under cross-examination, that\r\nhis testimony had been written and rewritten by himself or the lawyer\r\nfor the defence, and carefully conned before coming on the stand. The\r\nDistrict Attorney asked one of these tutored witnesses why he had read\r\nover the written preparation of his testimony in the rotunda of the\r\ncourt-house just before going on the stand.\r\n\r\n\"I read it over,\" he replied, lucidly, \"for the simple reason of\r\nreading it over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just to practise in reading?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps we might call it practice in reading.\"[498]\r\n\r\n\"This preparation of the testimony,\" said the District Attorney to the\r\njury, \"which I stigmatize as infamous, this going to a witness and\r\nwriting him down, and having him fix it, and write it over again, and\r\nkeeping it in his mind, and reading it over, and so going on the stand,\r\nis not the way to try a lawsuit, in my mind. I write nothing down. I\r\ncoach no witnesses. I want a witness to tell me his story. I put him on\r\nthe stand and he tells me his story; but no writing down, no reading\r\nover. It is not right, and it is very liable to be very wrong.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral witnesses were introduced to prove that Matthews had offered\r\nto settle the criminal prosecution. He could not have done so had he\r\nwished to. The criminal case was in the hands of the State. Of the\r\nwitnesses who made this charge against Matthews, one was a stockholder\r\nin the trust, another had been a stockholder in one of its pipe lines,\r\nand both had to admit on cross-examination that the occasion of his\r\nalleged agreeing to settle the case had been that they had gone to him\r\nfor their friends, unsolicited by him and unexpected, to find out at\r\nwhat price he would sell his works to the combination.\" I was anxious\r\nto settle the criminal prosecution,\" said one of these ambassadors.\r\n\r\n\"Anxious for whom?\" asked the ever-ready District Attorney.\r\n\r\n\"I should say--nobody,\" replied the witness, in confusion.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Matthews told him,\" said Mr. Hiram Benedict, one of the best-known\r\ncitizens of Lockport, who was present, \"that if they bought the capital\r\nstock of the company they could do what they chose with the civil\r\nsuits, but with the criminal suit he had nothing to do; the people had\r\nthat in charge.\"[499]\r\n\r\nThe lawyers tried to make a jest of the whole proceeding, and affected\r\nto look upon the incidents of this rivalry with their powerful client\r\nas something too trivial to be noticed. \"Is it a trivial matter,\" asked\r\nDistrict Attorney Quinby, \"that it shall be decided, once for all, in\r\na court of justice, that in an alleged republic you and I shall not\r\nstart a business which is a rival to some one else? That is the issue\r\nhere, and yet the lawyers for the accused tell us it is trivial. It\r\nis the most important question that was ever left to a jury of twelve\r\nmen in this or any country in this age of monopoly.\" The jury thought\r\nso too. The meaning of the policy of suppressing competition was\r\nskilfully described by Judge Edward Hatch, Mr. Matthews' counsel in\r\nthe civil suit for damages, and here again the jury, representing the\r\npeople, thought so too. \"When a man or a corporation is in a position\r\nto control the market as to a given article, then everybody is within\r\ntheir power, and it rests with their conscience to determine what\r\nshall be the price. Every time you farmers at home, or your wives or\r\ndaughters, take your oil-can, turn it up, fill your lamp, and then\r\nsit down to read by it, you can understand what is meant by this\r\nproposition to crush these men out.... It was a matter that not only\r\nthese three men were interested in, but every person that lived in the\r\ncommunity. Competition would run along to a point where you could get\r\nthe oils that you use in your families, to grease your wagons, and to\r\nburn in your houses, or for any other purpose, at a price that should\r\ngive the manufacturer a fair profit, and at the lowest possible price.\r\nOn the other hand, if you leave that open to these parties to regulate\r\nas they saw fit, having a monopoly of the market, then you rest upon\r\nthe conscience of a corporation and put your faith in a soulless\r\nindividual.\"\r\n\r\nIt is one of the few bright lines in this picture that whenever the\r\npeople got a chance to make themselves heard, their utterance was\r\nalways right and true. The four juries which passed upon the facts\r\nunderstood them, and had the moral standard by which to judge them\r\naright.\r\n\r\nOne of the trust's employés was put on the stand to break the effect\r\nof the evidence that the competition of the new works had put down the\r\nprice of oil. \"In the early part of 1881--the winter of 1881\"--he said,\r\n\"common oil was 5-1/2 cents a gallon\"--this to prove that the reduction\r\nhad preceded the appearance of the new refinery. He was confronted\r\nby the District Attorney with one of his own bills of oil sold in\r\nFebruary, 1881. \"That would seem to be a sale of 120 degrees oil at 12\r\ncents a gallon,\" he confessed, and added, awkwardly, \"I was asked as to\r\nthe winter of 1881. That is not the winter of 1881 as I understand. I\r\nmeant to speak from July, 1881, and so on.\"[500]\r\n\r\nThe great lawyers held up to the ridicule of the jury the idea that the\r\ngases of distilling petroleum were dangerous. Matthews stated on the\r\nstand that he had seen this gas burn up derricks, property, and several\r\nmen. The lawyers could not let anything so absurd go unchallenged.\r\n\r\n\"Did it explode?\" he was asked smartly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how did the 'explosion' burn up the men and property?\" with a\r\nknowing look to the jury.\r\n\r\n\"The gases crept quietly to the boilers, unobserved,\" said the witness,\r\n\"and all at once the whole atmosphere was ablaze.\"\r\n\r\nThe witnesses who tried to prove that no harm could have resulted from\r\nthe tampering with the still broke down. One of them was the inspector\r\nof oils at the combination's refinery at Cleveland. He, too, had once\r\nbeen an independent refiner, but had passed under the yoke. He declared\r\nwith every possible variation of phrase that there could not have been\r\nan explosion at the Buffalo works; but the District Attorney got out of\r\nhim piecemeal admissions that the \"escaping petroleum gases would be\r\ninflammable\"; that \"in a damp day you would expect them to settle close\r\nto the still\"; that then, if they came in contact with fire, \"you would\r\nhave a large flash, and consume those vapors; if a person was in the\r\nvicinity he would burn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask you if it would be a safe thing to fill a still with 175 barrels\r\nof petroleum, put under it an extremely hot fire, so that the front\r\nportion of the still is a cherry red, and a weighted safety-valve is\r\nblown off--would you consider that a safe thing to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not.\"\r\n\r\nStill another of these witnesses ended, like Balaam, by saying just the\r\nopposite of what had been wanted of him. He testified that the escape\r\nof gases from the stills, and even their ignition, was a matter of no\r\nconsequence--\"it may occur at any time\"--until he was cross-examined.\r\nIt turned out then that his own works had been burned three times by\r\nthe gases from distillation taking fire. \"These gases,\" he had to\r\nadmit, \"took fire and burned the receiving-house. A man got burned up\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you willing,\" the District Attorney asked, sarcastically, \"to go\r\ndown to the Buffalo works and have them run some vapor, on a quiet day,\r\non the ground, and let you stand in the middle of it and touch it off?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not anxious to do that.\"[501]\r\n\r\nEvery one looked to see Matthews crushed by the cross-examination, in\r\naccordance with the widely advertised promises of the counsel on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\n\"As he stood up to take the oath,\" said the New York _World_, \"and\r\nconfronted the men with whom he had been at sword's-point for six\r\nyears, men of unlimited wealth and almost unlimited influence, and\r\ncontrolling the most gigantic monopoly of any age or any country,\r\nCharles B. Matthews looked, as a good observer said, what he proved\r\nhimself to be, a fighter, who will never know when he is whipped. Hard\r\nknocks and a struggle of years against an all-powerful enemy have\r\nwhitened his hair, and set firm, hard lines about his face. His eyes\r\nare deep-set under a protruding forehead and black, bushy lashes, and\r\nare dark, firm, and searching. His jet-black beard is luxuriant but\r\ncoarse, his whole head and face bespeak the dogged persistence in\r\nfollowing a foe that is characteristic of the man. He is tall, well\r\nbuilt, and with those whom he knows to be friends he is kindly and\r\nalmost jovial in his manner.\" He told his story, and the jury believed\r\nit. One of the most damaging portions of his testimony was that given\r\nto connect the New York members of the trust with the conspiracy by\r\nshowing that they had the actual, practical, continuous management of\r\nthe Vacuum in matters small as well as large. Matthews, when in their\r\nemploy, was kept running to New York continually to see one or the\r\nother of them about some detail of the business. Seeking to break down\r\nthe force of this testimony, the big gun of the legal battery opened on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"But you did not see the name\" of the oil combination \"up over the\r\noffice that you went into (in New York)?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think I ever saw the name over the office that I went into. I\r\nthink that name is not often in view over where they do business.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"My experience and observation.\"\r\n\r\n\"What experience and observation have you had?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want I should tell it all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you need not tell it all. We will let that go now.\" Matthews had\r\nbeen in their employ. He knew about the staff of lobbyists they keep to\r\ngo from capital to capital as needed.\r\n\r\nFor lack of evidence the jury was offered abuse of Matthews, spoken by\r\nthe brilliant attorney on a shout which enabled the populace outside\r\nthe court-house to hear his speech, and, as the verdict proved,\r\ndeafened the jury to his eloquence. The jury preferred the view given\r\nby the District Attorney. \"When I look upon the troubled face of\r\nMatthews,\" said District Attorney Quinby in his closing of the case, \"I\r\nknow what is coming upon his head. When I know the struggle he has gone\r\nthrough, the integrity that is in his heart, I would say to him, 'Well\r\ndone, good and faithful servant, you have withstood the powerful arm\r\nof this insatiable corporation. You stand to-day honored from one end\r\nof this land to the other.' ... I am proud that in the county of Erie\r\nhas been born a gentleman who has had the bravery and fortitude he has\r\nshown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nCRIME CHEAPER THAN COMPETITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury was composed of nine farmers, one tailor, one store-keeper,\r\nand one railroad foreman. \"So intelligent a jury,\" said the Buffalo\r\n_Express_, \"is proof perfect that the verdict it returns is the\r\nonly one warranted by the law and evidence.\" The jury found all the\r\ndefendants guilty whom the court allowed them to try. The verdict,\r\n\"Guilty as charged in the indictment,\" was given May 18, 1887. Every\r\npossibility of appeal and reversal was resorted to. The judge granted\r\na stay, and this left the defendants unsentenced. A motion for a new\r\ntrial postponed the day of fate until December 24, 1887.\r\n\r\nWhen the judge decided against the new trial an appeal was taken, and\r\nwas carried through every court except the highest. Legal procedure\r\nin New York makes the courts a hunting preserve for those who can\r\nafford the luxuries of litigation. The law was changed by the Field\r\ncode so that demurrers and counter-appeals, proceedings and ancillary\r\nproceedings, on technical points can be carried, one after another,\r\nfrom court to court, while the real point at issue has to wait untried\r\nbelow for the results of this interminable contest. By grace of\r\nthis power to carry preliminary and technical questions from court\r\nto court, at the pleasure of quibbling and appealing lawyers and\r\nprocrastinating judges, from courts of Oyer and Terminer to the Supreme\r\nCourt at General Term, to the Court of Appeals, rich corporations and\r\nindividuals are able to tire out altogether all ordinary opponents.\r\nIt was only by help of very able and highly paid lawyers, officers of\r\nthe courts and of justice, that the law of New York was \"reformed,\"\r\nso that the technical parts of a case could be to such an extent\r\ndisengaged from the main body, and sent forward and backward, up and\r\ndown, through the whole series of appeals, consuming endless time and\r\nmoney, while poor men seeking justice kick their heels in the lowest\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nAs the time for pronouncing sentence came on, petitions for mercy were\r\ncirculated in Buffalo and Rochester. The members of the jury which\r\nhad found the accused guilty were labored with separately to sign\r\na recantation. Only six succumbed and signed a statement that the\r\nprisoners were found guilty, not because they had conspired to blow up\r\ntheir rival's refinery, but because they had enticed away Albert. This\r\nrecantation was in the face of the judge's charge, which had made the\r\nplot to blow up the Buffalo works the chief and the important inquiry\r\nin this case, and the verdict had been given under the influence of\r\nthis view of the case. Six of the jury saw the impropriety of making\r\nthis statement after they had disbanded and passed from under the legal\r\nand moral restraints they felt when sitting under their oath of office,\r\nand refused to sign it.\r\n\r\nWhen the paper from the complaisant six jurors was handed in, the\r\nDistrict Attorney said in court: \"These jurors received money for\r\nmaking these affidavits. If required to do so I will prove the\r\nstatement.\" He was not called upon to do so. \"These affidavits,\" he\r\nsaid afterwards, \"were procured for the purpose of influencing the\r\nCourt to administer the lighter punishment, since they tended to\r\nshow that the verdict was directed against the lighter offence. One\r\nof the jurors told me he had been offered money to sign one of these\r\naffidavits, and he knew of one juror who had received $10 for signing\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the last possibility in the way of proceedings for a stay or for a\r\nnew trial had been exhausted, except argument of an appeal in the Court\r\nof Appeals, which was known to be useless, sentence was pronounced.\r\nThe penalty provided in the statutes was imprisonment for one year in\r\nthe penitentiary, or a fine of $250, or both. The lawyers pleaded\r\nthat the elder of the convicted men was old, that the younger had just\r\nreturned from a wedding tour in Europe, that some of the wealthiest\r\nand most prominent citizens of Rochester had petitioned for mercy,\r\nand that six of the jury had done likewise. Each was sentenced to pay\r\na fine of $250. Notice of appeal was given by the convicted, and a\r\nyear was consumed on both sides in preparations to fight the case to\r\na bitter finish. But the appeal was abandoned. A new trial and new\r\nsentence might have ended worse. The fine was paid, and these employés\r\nof the trust, upon whose record as reputable and inoffensive citizens\r\nfor all the years of their business career no shadow had fallen till\r\nthey entered its employ, took thereby the place assigned them by the\r\njury--that of convicts guilty of crime.\r\n\r\nCrime, it seems, may in this country be cheaper than competition.\r\nThey who received the larger part of the benefit of the enticement\r\nof Albert, of the harassing litigation, of the damage done by the\r\nexplosion, and of the bankruptcy which was finally produced by these\r\nmeans, went free of all punishment; and the employés found their crime\r\nbut little less than a pastime. After his conviction, and before his\r\nsentence, one of the two married. His wedding was attended by many of\r\nthe great men of the trust--magnates in the New York world of affairs\r\nand its affiliated interests. It glittered with gold and silver and\r\nprecious stones which they sent to signify to the world that they stood\r\nsponsor for him.\r\n\r\nThe case of some humble boycotters was then fresh in the public mind.\r\nCertain working-men, on strike, handed around printed circulars in the\r\nstreets of New York, requesting people not to buy beer sold by their\r\nemployer. In a few weeks from the time they dropped those circulars in\r\nthe streets they were in the penitentiary at Sing Sing. It was shown on\r\ntheir trial that they were entirely ignorant of the fact that they were\r\nviolating any of the laws of the State in what they did. It was shown\r\non the trial of the oil men that they did know that the course they had\r\nin view was criminal, and were warned by a lawyer it might land them\r\nin prison. \"It was very fortunate,\" said the New York _World_, \"that\r\nthey were not poor men convicted of stealing a ham.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons given by the judge for his leniency was that\r\nprominent citizens of Buffalo and Rochester had begged for mercy. \"With\r\nthe very highest respect for the judge,\" said the Buffalo _Express_,\r\n\"as the _Express_ has often demonstrated, we must say that this is a\r\nmighty queer excuse. Three-fourths of those citizens are in one way\r\nor another identified in interest with the oil trust, as the judge\r\ncould readily have ascertained, and their names on that petition were\r\nentitled to no more moral weight in the consideration of this case than\r\nthe names of the two guilty men should have had if they had seen fit to\r\nsign it.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentence raised a whirlwind of indignation. \"As ridiculous as\r\nanything that could be imagined,\" said the Philadelphia _Ledger_. \"It\r\nis high time,\" said the New York _World_, \"that the lines were drawn\r\nbetween competition and conspiracy, between business and brigandage.\"\r\nReferring to the golden harvest of $300,000 dividends in one year on\r\na capital of $100,000, representing an original investment of only\r\n$13,500, the _World_ said: \"The monopoly of this sort of business is\r\na very seductive thing. It is calculated to make men of more boldness\r\nthan morals blow up factories, or do almost anything else to control\r\nthe field.\" \"It can afford to blow up a rival refinery every day\r\nin the year at that price,\" said the Erie _Dispatch_. \"There have\r\nbeen conspiracies,\" said the Oil City _Blizzard_ (Pa.), \"to injure\r\nthe business of opposition concerns right here in Oil City, and the\r\nconspirators have never been punished.\" \"It is--a light sentence,\" was\r\nthe comment of the Buffalo _Commercial_. \"Poor criminals,\" the Buffalo\r\n_Express_ declared, \"may well wonder why rich ones are let off so\r\neasily. It is equivalent to deciding that wealth may securely indulge\r\nin that inexpensive sort of amusement as a mere pastime. Who's afraid?\"\r\nit asked. \"What conspirator 'in restraint' of trade is afraid of a $250\r\nfine?\" \"Certain it is that no wealthy criminals convicted of such a\r\ncrime ever before received from a court such a mockery of justice,\" was\r\nthe verdict of the Springfield (Mass.) _Republican_.\r\n\r\nThe facts of this case have not been carelessly examined or decided.\r\nTwo grand-juries in succession passed upon the evidence and found it\r\ngood enough for indictments. Two petit juries heard the evidence,\r\nboth for and against, in the civil and criminal suits, and found it\r\ngood enough--one jury for $20,000 damages, another for a verdict of\r\ncriminally guilty. Seventy picked citizens have unanimously concurred\r\nin the decision \"Guilty.\" And this scarlet letter the monopoly will\r\nalways have to carry.\r\n\r\n\"So surely as Matthews lives, and so long as he lives,\" District\r\nAttorney Quinby said in the criminal prosecution, \"he will never again\r\nmake another dollar upon a barrel of oil he may manufacture. The\r\nword has gone forth, right in this court-room, that this man shall\r\nbe crushed, and he can never again run his works successfully. That\r\nis going to be one of the results of this case.\" The fulfilment of\r\nthis prediction came swiftly. This sentence of ruin upon Matthews was\r\nexecuted before sentence was even pronounced upon the conspirators\r\nagainst him. He had been left crippled by the flight and corruption\r\nof his partner, the only practical oil man in the enterprise. When\r\nhe tried to obtain some one to take his place, he could not get word\r\nof any one not connected with the oil combination. He did not dare\r\nto advertise, and knew no one in Buffalo he could venture to speak\r\nto. He had made contracts before opening the works, and was unable to\r\nfill them. The pipes had been laid wrong; it took him a year trying\r\none way and another, and making a great many mistakes, to set them\r\nright. His third partner was frightened back into the employ of the oil\r\ncombination by threatening litigation.\r\n\r\nThen came the suits to destroy, punctually as threatened.[502] \"If one\r\ncourt does not sustain the patents, we will carry them up until you\r\nget enough of it,\" one of the trustees said to Matthews. One of the\r\nRochester managers, in speaking of these suits, said: \"I don't know as\r\nwe will gain anything really, but we will embarrass them by bringing\r\nthese suits, and, if it is necessary, we will bring them once a month;\r\nyes, we will bring them once a week.\" One, two, three, four, five suits\r\ncame with injunctions. \"Null and void\" was the verdict of court after\r\ncourt on the worthless patents and pretended trade-marks on which he\r\nwas sued.\r\n\r\nMatthews had to keep pushing his pursuers to trial. What they wanted\r\nwas not decisions but delays, to ruin him by the waste of time and\r\nmoney.[503] \"It cost me one-third of my time, and $25,000 or more to\r\ndefend these suits.\" These suits were used to scare away his customers.\r\n\"I was instructed,\" said the Boston representative of the combination,\r\n\"to tell the customers that the Buffalo company were using their\r\npatents.\"[504] The sole legal victory the combination won was the\r\nrecovery of six cents damages on a technical point.\r\n\r\nMatthews, on his side, took to the courts. He sued his persecutors as\r\nindividuals and corporations. He pursued them civilly and criminally.\r\nHe was successful in defending himself against their suits. All his\r\nsuits were successful as far as he was able to carry them. One suit\r\nfor damages produced a $20,000 verdict; another was for $250,000,\r\non the still stronger evidence procured in the criminal trial. It\r\ntook Matthews two years--from 1883 to 1885--to get his first case\r\nfor damages for conspiracy to trial. All that time was consumed by\r\nhis opponents in quibbles about procedure, technical objections, and\r\nmotions for delay, appealing them from court to court. The judge, in\r\ntaking from the jury afterwards the three trustees who had been brought\r\nto trial for conspiracy, declared that he could see no reason to\r\nbelieve that these suits had been brought without probable cause. But\r\nthe jury before which the suit for damages was tried saw plenty of such\r\nreasons, and gave Matthews' company a verdict of $20,000 damages. The\r\nviews of the judge and jury might have varied in the same way on the\r\nquestion of the guilt of the three members of the trust.\r\n\r\nMatthews woke up one morning to discover, as he had been told he would,\r\nthat there was no Atlas Company to get his oil from. Corporations may\r\nhave no souls, but they can love each other. The Erie Railroad killed\r\nthe pipe line of the Atlas Company for the oil combination.[505] The\r\ncourts had been kept busy granting injunctions against it on the\r\nmotion of the Erie. These were invariably dissolved by the courts,\r\nbut an application for a new one would always follow. At one time the\r\nlawyers had fifteen injunctions all ready in their hands to be sued\r\nout, one after the other, as fast as needed. The pipe line was finally\r\ndestroyed by force. Where it crossed under the Erie road in the bed\r\nof a stream grappling-irons were fastened to it, and with an immense\r\nhawser a locomotive guarded by two freight cars full of men pulled it\r\nto pieces. The Atlas line and refinery became the \"property\" of their\r\nenemy. Matthews' supply of crude oil was not cut off immediately. He\r\nwas tapered off. One of the superintendents of the Atlas testified in\r\nthe suit for damages Matthews brought against the Atlas after it passed\r\ninto the hands of the combination, that by the order of the manager\r\nof the refinery he mixed refuse oil with the crude which they sold to\r\nthe Buffalo Lubricating Oil Company. Finally the supply was shut off\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nMatthews turned to the railroads connecting Buffalo with the oil\r\ncountry. They all put up their rates. At the increased rates they\r\nwould not bring him enough to keep him going; they would not give him\r\ncars enough, and told him they would not let him put his own cars on\r\nthe road. Even the lake steamers raised their rates against him. The\r\nfarmer-refiner was taking his lesson in the course which had driven\r\nhis first employer to dig oil-wells because \"there were restrictions\r\nin the shipments.\" Cut off from a supply by either pipe or rail at\r\nBuffalo, Matthews made an alliance with the Keystone Refinery in the\r\noil regions. War was now made upon the Keystone. It was finally ruined.\r\n\r\nPacks of lawyers were set upon Matthews, and they finally brought\r\nhim down. An attorney appeared before a judge and made a motion that\r\nthe property of Matthews' company be taken out of Matthews' hands\r\nand be placed in the charge of a receiver, as officer of the court,\r\nto secure a debt due a Buffalo bank. This done, the lawyer appeared\r\nbefore the judge who afterwards decided that $250 fine was punishment\r\nenough for criminal conspiracy, with an offer from the monopoly to\r\npay $17,300 for the discontinuance of the suits for damages which\r\nMatthews had instituted, and $63,700 for all the other assets. The\r\nother creditors and all the stockholders opposed the motion, but the\r\njudge granted it. There were two suits. One had produced a verdict of\r\n$20,000, and the other one for $250,000 was brought on the new and\r\nmuch stronger evidence secured in the criminal trial. As to the value\r\nof the property, Matthews had brought his enterprise to the point\r\nwhere it was worth $20,000 a year. It was capable of producing many\r\ntimes that amount of profit. Had not Albert been enticed away, the new\r\nworks would have yielded a profit of over $100,000 the first year.\r\nThey had a capacity of 70 to 80 barrels a day of lubricating oil,\r\nand the profit was $5 to $6 a barrel at the time Matthews and Albert\r\nwent into the business.[506] The judge, overruling a majority of the\r\ncreditors, ordered the receiver to accept the offer. He gave as his\r\nreason for selling these damage suits that a criminal prosecution had\r\nalready taken place for the same offences, and a person could not be\r\npunished twice for the same offence. As they had not yet been punished,\r\nthis meant, if it meant anything, that the suits were to be sold out\r\nfor this inconsiderable sum, and the guilty men were to get their\r\npunishment in the sentence he was to pass upon them in the criminal\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nThree months later, before the same judge, these convicted agents stood\r\nup to receive their criminal sentence. The judge gave them the lightest\r\nsentence in his power, \"nominal punishment.\" He did so, he was reported\r\nby the Buffalo press to have said, because \"it has come to the\r\nattention of the court that civil suits have been brought to recover\r\ndamages sustained by reason of the same overt acts. Large punitive\r\ndamages are demanded in those actions. It is fundamental that a person\r\ncannot be punished twice for the same offence.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge released them from the suits for damages because they were\r\nto be punished criminally. Then he released them from any but nominal\r\npunishment, because there had been suits for damages. One would infer\r\nthat the civil suits for damages were in full career in the courts,\r\nto end possibly in hundreds of thousands of dollars' damages against\r\nthe convicted. No one would infer what was the truth--and who should\r\nhave remembered it so well as the judge, for it was he who had done\r\nit?--that the civil suits had been ordered sold. The judge had ordered\r\nhis officer--the receiver--who had the luckless Matthews' affairs in\r\nhis grip, not to try the cases, but to sell them. The suits had been\r\nordered sold in February preceding, and they were as dead as--justice.\r\nBut as all the technical formalities and slow proceedings needed to\r\nconsummate the sale had not been completed when sentence was passed in\r\nMay, the damages they might produce were made a reason for inflicting\r\nnone but nominal punishment. The order of sale made it impossible that\r\nthey should ever be tried.\r\n\r\nOf the money paid into court, nearly half--$30,000--went to the\r\nlawyers, and, crudest stroke of all, the attorney who had made the\r\nsuccessful motion before the judge to take Matthews' property away, and\r\nto order the forced sale, got $5000. Matthews got nothing. Even his\r\nright to sue his destroyers had been sold to them on their own motion\r\nand at their own price.\r\n\r\nThe crime was plotted in March, 1881. The participants were indicted in\r\n1886. It took until May 15, 1887, to secure conviction. While sentence\r\nwas still unpronounced Matthews' property was put into the hands of a\r\nreceiver of the court, January 16, 1888; the property was sold by order\r\nof the court, February 17, 1888; sentence was pronounced May 8, 1888;\r\nthe formalities of the sale were consummated July 11, 1888; and the\r\nsentence, coming last of all--the fine of $250--was executed May 1,\r\n1889.\r\n\r\nMatthews had tried to make money in oil, and had failed; but his\r\ncompetition had forced those in control of the markets to increase the\r\nprice to the producer, and he made light cheaper to the community. In\r\nBuffalo his enterprise had caused the price to drop to 6 cents from 12\r\nand 18 cents, in Boston[507] to 8 cents from 20. Oil has never since\r\nbeen as high in Boston or Buffalo as before he challenged the monopoly.\r\nAnd he forced the struggle into the view of the public, and succeeded\r\nin putting on record in the archives of courts and legislatures and\r\nCongress a picture of the realities of modern commerce certain to\r\nexercise a profound influence in ripening the reform thought with which\r\nour air is charged into reform action.\r\n\r\nNothing is so dramatic as fact, when you can find the fact. The\r\ntreatment his church gave the brother, who had been the victim, as\r\njudicially declared, of a criminal conspiracy, is described in the\r\nfollowing letter from Matthews:\r\n\r\n \"BUFFALO, January 19, 1888.\r\n\r\n \"MY DEAR FRIEND,--As your father was a clergyman, and as you feel an\r\n interest in church affairs, I think you will wish to know of my recent\r\n experiences. My church here is not a rich one, but we pay as much for\r\n church music as we do as salary to our pastor. Probably the wealthiest\r\n man in our church is an agent of the oil trust. He receives a salary\r\n of $18,000 per year, and keeps their retail store here, and has been a\r\n witness for them in important suits. He does not belong to our church,\r\n but is a trustee and treasurer of the Church, and is very kind to our\r\n pastor, whom he took last summer on quite an extended vacation trip\r\n in New England. But you know the class of men that usually become\r\n trustees in our city churches these days.\r\n\r\n \"My pastor surprised me a few days ago by making a visit at my office,\r\n and telling me that as my term of office as member of the session\r\n expired soon, it might be best for me not to be a candidate for\r\n re-election, in view of what the newspapers had said about me, and\r\n the opposition there was. He said, however, that he personally felt\r\n friendly to me, and regarded me highly. He seemed to be embarrassed,\r\n but I quickly relieved the situation by saying that I had told my\r\n family some months before that I should not again hold a church\r\n office. I told the doctor he well knew I did not desire office in or\r\n out of the Church. True, the newspapers, under the influence of the\r\n oil trust, had ridiculed me as 'farmer Matthews from the country.' But\r\n why should my pastor mock me with such shallow pretences for reasons\r\n for church opposition to me? I had engaged in the oil business without\r\n the consent of the oil monopoly, and my pastor then and there told me\r\n my friends thought me foolhardy in doing so. I could hardly suppress\r\n my feelings on hearing this said by the man who baptized my children\r\n and ministers at the church altar. What could all this mean? I had\r\n only fought for my rights as an American citizen, as a manufacturer\r\n and shipper of oil. I had been sustained in every detail by the\r\n courts. I had convicted in our courts prominent men of conspiracy,\r\n little thinking that the subtle power of these men could come to\r\n dominate the Church itself. My feelings were intense, and words came\r\n thick and fast--all too tame to express my feelings. I told the doctor\r\n how I had struggled on from boyhood, and at middle age had accumulated\r\n a few thousand dollars, and in all these years had never sued a man or\r\n been sued, and that my struggle with the oil monopoly was for rights\r\n that no one worthy to be called a man dare to surrender. I told the\r\n doctor how I had been hounded, and my business beset by spies--that\r\n my friends had often told me I was in danger of assassination if I\r\n continued the fight in the courts. He, having done his errand, seemed\r\n uneasy, and anxious to go. I told him I had seen the rising and\r\n corrupting power of this trust in their control of our aldermen and\r\n courts, in state and national legislation. I could witness all this\r\n with comparative composure; but it made every drop of my blood hot\r\n to see them erect their altars for Mammon worship in the Church of\r\n the living God. I had seen the hard-won earnings of a lifetime swept\r\n away, and had hoped that at least one word of sympathy might come\r\n from the Church. If I had been robbed by old-fashioned highwaymen and\r\n the Church received none of the loot, church sympathy would have been\r\n hearty and abundant. But no; Sabbath after Sabbath our reverend doctor\r\n rises in the pulpit, and, at the regular time, says: 'Let us worship\r\n God in the gift of money.' Religion, divine worship, and money all\r\n seem to have a like meaning as they are alternately mentioned in our\r\n pulpit. My ancestors far back were church people, but this worshipping\r\n money, or worshipping God with money, is all new to me. It was not the\r\n acceptable worship required by Christ and taught by his disciples.\r\n After the conversation I had with my pastor that day I trudged home,\r\n but could not sleep that night. My heart was too full of sorrow as\r\n well as anger. I hope you will forgive me for writing you so long a\r\n letter. I have written much more than I intended to, but did not see\r\n where to stop. There are many things I wish you could see but not\r\n experience in the life of a business man nowadays. I want you to write\r\n often, as every word from a true friend is prized highly in these dark\r\n days for me.\"\r\n\r\nThe action of the judge in this and another celebrated case was made\r\nan issue in the elections in New York in 1889. In June, 1882, the\r\nrailroads in New York City, rather than pay the freight-handlers the\r\n20 cents an hour they asked for, instead of 17 cents, brought the\r\nbusiness of the city to a stop. They refused to employ their old men\r\nat that price, and did not supply their places. Trucks by thousands,\r\nheavy with merchandise, stood before the railroad freight-houses for\r\ndays, waiting in vain to be unloaded. The trade of the metropolis was\r\nparalyzed, and the railroad officials sat serenely in their offices,\r\nletting the jam pile up until the freight-handlers were starved into\r\naccepting the wages they were offered, and commercial distress had made\r\nthe business community desperate enough to tolerate that injustice, or\r\nany other iniquity, provided the \"Goddess of Getting-on\" were allowed\r\nto get on again. It was so clear that the price asked by the men was\r\nfair, and that the refusal of the railroads to set them at work and\r\nkeep the channels of trade open was due to a purpose to manufacture\r\nsuch widespread loss and trouble that the public should be goaded into\r\nforgetfulness of the rights of the men, that public opinion forced the\r\nAttorney-General of the State to act. Re-enforced by able counsel, he\r\napplied for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the roads to resume\r\noperations. This motion came before this Buffalo judge, then sitting\r\nby assignment in New York. He kept the people waiting ten days, and\r\nthen quashed and dismissed the petition. The decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt, composed of judges of both parties, reversing his action, was\r\nunanimous, but the mischief he had done was by that time--January 17,\r\n1883--long past mending.\r\n\r\nWhen he was nominated to be judge again, after his indecision and\r\ndecision had swelled the dividends of the great railways of New York,\r\nthe presiding officer of the convention which was to choose him to be\r\ntheir candidate was, by a coincidence, also the president of one of\r\nthe great railway corporations which had been involved in the judicial\r\nproceeding of 1882. The judge's record was made one of the issues in\r\nthe State election which followed the defeat of justice in Buffalo. He\r\nwas nominated by the Republicans in 1889 for Judge of the Court of\r\nAppeals, the highest court in the State of New York, and the nomination\r\nwas asserted by the New York _Times_, in a leading editorial, to have\r\nbeen procured by the oil trust. Its \"influence was active,\" said the\r\n_Times_, \"in securing the nomination of\" this judge. \" ... An attorney\r\nwho has labored in its interests at Albany during the last two sessions\r\nof the Legislature was conspicuous among the men who did the work.\" The\r\nNew York _Times_, the Buffalo _Courier_, the New York _Star_, the New\r\nYork _World_, and other leading journals of the State retold the story\r\nof the trial, and declared that the judge's action in taking the case\r\nof the members of the trust from the jury, and the sentence he gave the\r\nconvicted agents, made it clear that he was unfit to be a judge. The\r\noil combination, the _World_ said, editorially, \"have had agents busy\r\nthis year trying to secure his elevation to the highest court in the\r\nState.... We say confidently that the history of the case establishes\r\nhis conspicuous unfitness for a place on the bench of the Court of\r\nAppeals. He should be defeated, and with him the oppressive monopoly\r\nwhich is actively seeking his election.\"\r\n\r\nHe was defeated with the rest of the ticket. District Attorney Quinby\r\nwas re-elected several terms in succession. After their victory the\r\npeople went to sleep, but not the sower of tares. At the election of\r\n1890 the nomination of this judge to a seat on the bench was secured\r\nfrom both parties. For fourteen years, therefore--from 1890--a seat of\r\nthe Supreme Court, one of the most important tribunals of justice in\r\nNew York State, will be occupied by this judge, before whom must come\r\nmany questions affecting oil transportation, electric lighting, natural\r\ngas and illuminating, street railways, banking, and other interests of\r\nthe oil trust.\r\n\r\nMonopoly cannot be content with controlling its own business. It is the\r\ncreature of the same law which has always driven the tyrant to control\r\neverything--government, art, literature, even private conversation. Any\r\nfreedom, though seemingly the most remote from any possible bearing\r\nupon the tyrant, may--will grow from a little leak of liberty into a\r\nmighty flood, sweeping his palaces and dungeons away. The czar knows\r\nthat if he lets his people have so much freedom as free talk in their\r\nsitting-rooms their talk will gather into a tornado. In all ages\r\nwealth, like all power, has found that it must rule all or nothing. Its\r\ndestiny is rule or ruin, and rule is but a slower ruin. Hence we find\r\nit in America creeping higher every year up into the seats of control.\r\nIts lobbyists force the nomination of judges who will construe the laws\r\nas Power desires, and of senators who will get passed such laws as it\r\nwants for its judges to construe.\r\n\r\nThe press, too, must be controlled by Power. During the criminal trial\r\nat Buffalo one of the oil combination's detectives was put on the\r\nstand. He was compelled to produce his written instructions from the\r\ncounsel of the trust.[508] These had been given him at the office of\r\nthe oil trust in New York. He forwarded his reports to its office in\r\nNew York, and received his pay from the same place.[509] He sent his\r\nsubordinates to get employment in Matthews' works, and through them\r\nobtained information from the inside. The monopoly paid one of these\r\ndetectives $2.50 a day for spying, while he could earn only $1.50 a day\r\nfor working.\r\n\r\n\"I see here further,\" said the District Attorney, \"'Why the _Express_\r\npublished the last complaint'\"--in Matthews' suit for $250,000 damages.\r\n\"Did he ask you to find out about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, he wanted you to find out what arrangements were made with\r\nthe Buffalo _Express_ to have the complaint published?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; the whole complaint. It covered the whole of the newspaper.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you know 'how many copies were taken by Matthews?' Did he tell\r\nyou to find that out, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"[510]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nANOTHER TALE OF TWO CITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe South is the most American part of America. Close observers note\r\nas its especial characteristic the preservation of the original\r\nAnglo-Saxon types, which gave this country its first and deepest\r\nimpress.\r\n\r\nThe South is not yet so steeped as the North in the commercialism to\r\nwhich it is all of life to buy and sell, and its population, less\r\naffected by trade and immigration, remains more nearly American, as the\r\nfathers were American, than the parts of the country flooded by the\r\nfull force of the modern tide. Only in the South is there record all\r\nthrough this history of a man \"too prejudiced to buy\" from those who\r\nclaimed the sole right to sell.\r\n\r\nThe merchants of Columbus, Mississippi, were buying their oil of the\r\nsouthern branch of the combination when they were offered a supply at\r\ncheaper prices by an independent refiner. They asked the combination\r\nto meet this competition of the market. This was refused. There were\r\neleven firms there which sold oil in connection with other things. The\r\ncombination \"coolly informed us,\" wrote one of the firms to a journal\r\nof the trade, \"that we were in their power, and could not buy oil\r\nfrom any one else, and that we should either pay such prices as they\r\ndemanded or not sell oil. We immediately formed an association among\r\nourselves and ordered from other parties. On receipt of our first car\r\nthey immediately put the retail price below the cost per car lots,\r\nand for some time tried to whip us in that way, as we still declined\r\nto handle their oil. They then wrote offering to rebate to several of\r\nthe larger firms if they would withdraw and leave the smaller ones to\r\nfight the battle alone. This proposition we declined, and they again\r\ntried the low-price dodge, their agent telling us that they would\r\nspend $10,000 to crush us out. This game they have now been trying for\r\nthree years, and in that time we have not handled one gallon of their\r\noil.\" As these devices, irresistible in more commercial civilizations,\r\ndid not fool the brotherhood of Columbus, a special agent was sent to\r\nColumbus to carry on the war.\r\n\r\n\"You can tell the Columbus merchants if this does not succeed we will\r\nhave it out on other lines,\" the agent was instructed, in the strain\r\nof the letter to the merchant of Nashville.[511] \"The battle has not\r\nfairly opened yet; sharpen up your sword, we mean war to the knife.\"\r\nAnd again: \"We want Columbus squelched,\" was the word sent the agent\r\nfrom the headquarters at Louisville.\r\n\r\nHe was ordered to start a grocery store in Columbus, to compete in\r\ntheir entire business with the \"black-mailers.\" While the fight was\r\non, and it was still hoped to conquer Columbus, the following was kept\r\nprominently before the people in the daily papers:\r\n\r\n\"We desire to state that we did not establish an agency in Columbus to\r\nforce the wholesale grocers to handle our oil.\"\r\n\r\nBut seven years later the general in command of this department told\r\nCongress it was his practice to fight in that way. \"Almost invariably I\r\ndid that always.\"[512]\r\n\r\n\"To threaten the people elsewhere with Columbus,\" the agent at Columbus\r\nwas told, \"will make them scat, as it were, and take our oil at any\r\nprice.\" But the people of Columbus did not \"scat.\" The new store had a\r\ncomplete stock of groceries. Prices on everything, including oil, were\r\nput \"down to the bone.\" But one essential feature of the enterprise all\r\nthe ingenuity and power of the invader could not furnish--customers.\r\nGoods were advertised at cost; alluring signs were hung out with daily\r\nvariations; but the people would not buy. A few citizens who bought at\r\nthe beginning, without understanding the plan of campaign, came out\r\nin the newspapers with cards of apology, and pledges that they would\r\nnot repeat the mistake. Local bankers refused to honor the drafts of\r\nthe enemy, threw out its accounts, and gave notice that they would\r\nadvance no money to persons who bought at its store. The public opinion\r\nof Columbus so bitterly resented the attack upon the livelihood of its\r\nmerchants, because they had dared to buy where they thought best, and\r\nso clearly saw that the subjugation of the merchants would be but the\r\npreliminary of a conquest of themselves, that any one seen within the\r\ndoors of the odious store fell into instant and deep disgrace. \"Their\r\nstore is regarded as a pest-house,\" wrote one of the leading business\r\nmen, \"and few respectable people ever darken their doors, their trade\r\nbeing confined mostly to negroes. Their oil trade has dwindled down to\r\nalmost nothing, and we are selling now to merchants in other towns who\r\nheretofore bought exclusively from them.\"\r\n\r\nAt the first sign of aggression the merchants had given up competition,\r\nwhich they saw meant only mutual ruin, and had tied themselves together\r\nin an association. Now as the struggle widened the people did the\r\nsame, and found a greater benefit and pleasure in co-operation than in\r\nkeeping up the delusion of the \"higgling of the market\" where there was\r\nno market. The _Index_, of Columbus, printed an agreement signed by\r\nhundreds \"of those who will sustain our home merchants in the struggle\r\nthey are making.... It will receive many more signatures among our\r\ncitizens.... The people have only to understand to properly decide in\r\nthis matter between right and wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ask if the feeling is bitter against them in our 'community,'\"\r\none of the merchants wrote. \"I can only liken it to the spirit which\r\nprevailed when the people of Boston emptied King George's taxed tea\r\ninto Boston Harbor.\"\r\n\r\nAttempt was made to intimidate the press. Advertisements were\r\ndiscontinued because the papers supported the cause of the people.\r\n\"If the agent,\" said the _Index_, of Columbus, \"thought the cash that\r\nmight be obtained for such advertisements could purchase the silence\r\nof this journal when it should speak, or its support in a wrong cause,\r\nhe reckoned without his host.\" \"The pledge\" was signed by practically\r\nevery man in the place. The country people about Columbus, when they\r\ncame to town to sell produce and buy supplies, took back with them\r\nblanks of the agreement not to buy the obnoxious oil, and circulated\r\nthem among their neighbors for signature. Agents were sent among\r\nthese country people to win back their trade, but they could not be\r\nmoved. The competition was made \"war to the knife,\" and the knife \"to\r\nthe bone.\" It was a singular sight--this concentration of millions\r\nto \"kill\" these little men in this remote country town in far-off\r\nMississippi. Nothing was too small to do. When one of the Columbus\r\n\"rebels\" bought oats for his trade, a competitive stock of the same\r\nkind of oats was hurried into Columbus, and these instructions sent\r\nwith it: \"Put your sign out. Rust-proof oats to arrive at 98 cents to\r\n$1 a bushel. This will kill him. The same signs should be posted about\r\nmeats, sugar, coffee, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan of action of the Merchants' Association was simple: they\r\ndeclined to handle the enemy's oil at any price. \"Then to have a stock\r\nof our own always on hand, ready to sell whenever we could at a profit,\r\nand hold in reserve whenever they put prices below cost; and in this\r\nway we have made it a losing business to them for over three years, and\r\nwill continue to do so as long as they remain in our town.... When our\r\nassociation buys a car of oil, each member pays for and takes charge of\r\nan equal share, but the oil remains the property of the association;\r\nand should any member sell out before the others, he has the right to\r\nbuy from them at cost, and the next car is not ordered until all are\r\nnearly sold out.\"\r\n\r\nIt is \"our pleasure to make oil cheap\"; but a written proposition was\r\nmade to the merchants that if they would repent and return, the price\r\nwould be 20 cents a gallon, with a rebate to the loyal dealers. As\r\nthis oil could be, and was being, laid down in Columbus at 12 cents\r\na gallon, the proposition amounted to a request that the merchants\r\njoin in imposing a tax on the people of 8 cents a gallon, which must\r\nbe added to the retail price, and go to swell the profits of the\r\n\"sympathetical co-operation.\" \"Can any one,\" said the _Index_, \"after\r\nknowing these facts, doubt that in a pecuniary point our merchants\r\ncould have done better by surrendering the principle and joining the\r\nring? But, at the same time, could any reasoning man (even viewing it\r\nin the light of policy alone) advise such a course?--one which, if\r\nadopted, would only open the door for other monopolies to enter and\r\ndemand high prices on meat, flour, and the other necessaries of life,\r\nuntil our city becomes the highest market in the land. Let all good\r\ncitizens, then, unite in a steady effort to resist the yoke which this\r\nmonopoly is now trying to force upon us, and let us teach them and all\r\nothers that our people are too loyal to each other and too intelligent\r\nto allow themselves to be made the instruments of their own destruction.\r\n\r\n\"Remember, that should our merchants be forced to yield, the day of\r\nlow prices will be a short one, and then these strangers, having\r\naccomplished their purpose and forced their yoke upon you and us, will\r\nreturn to their homes, and while rioting in the taxes wrung from you,\r\nwith your own assistance, will laugh at you for allowing yourselves to\r\nbe so easily duped, and, emboldened by their success in forcing upon\r\nyou high-priced oil, will soon return to demand high prices on sugar,\r\ncoffee, and every other article of trade.\"\r\n\r\nThe nose for news of the American press scented out the novelty of a\r\nwhole community acting as one man in successful resistance to those who\r\nhad till then found nowhere any cohesive brotherliness to make a stand\r\nagainst them. The newspapers of the county took the matter up. It was\r\nabsolutely the first time any method had been found that could prevail\r\nagainst the tactics of divide and conquer, which had been elsewhere\r\nirresistible. Public attention was fascinated by the revelation that\r\na brotherhood to ravage the people turned impotent when the people\r\nwere roused to meet it with their brotherhood of the commonwealth.\r\nThere was in the spectacle a moral illumination--the light that never\r\nfails. Instead of becoming, as had been planned, a warning to all the\r\npeople of the dire destruction to be visited upon any who dared to\r\ndisobey, the encounter between the one-man power of united Columbus\r\nand the one-man power of hundreds of millions of dollars became every\r\nday more brilliantly a sign in the sky, showing all the people how the\r\ninvasion of their industrial liberties could be changed into a ruin\r\nmore complete than the retreat from Moscow. Scores of such assaults on\r\nthe people had been won before. \"What was being done at Columbus,\" said\r\none of the papers, \"is but what they have done before at Aberdeen, and\r\nat hundreds of other places North and South.\"\r\n\r\nBut as despoilers always have to fear, one defeat may undo a lifetime\r\nof conquest. The success of the people of Columbus was teaching the\r\npeople of the whole country, and of all markets, that their real enemy\r\nwas not the oil trust, but the lack of trust in each other. The people\r\nwere learning there was a magic in association more potent than the\r\ntrick of combinations. The _Index_ proposed to the people of the South\r\nto join the citizens of Columbus, and make the fight general. \"There\r\nis this about it: if there was concentrated action among the smaller\r\ncities and towns throughout even this section of the State, we would\r\nhave no fear of the result. The oil trust may be too strong for a\r\nsingle small locality, but if a combination of a certain number of\r\nlocalities handling oil were effected, they would soon be forced to\r\nretire. Such a combination can be and should be brought about at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe struggle at Columbus lasted three years. It had seemed unequal\r\nenough--a few thousands of dollars against hundreds of millions. But\r\nthree years of this commercial warfare failed to break the spirit or\r\nresources of the brave--and wise because brave--people. The community\r\nnever broke rank. They laughed when they were tempted with cheap\r\ncoffee, flour, sugar, to join in the attempt to bankrupt their home\r\nmerchants. They could see that the gift of forced cheapness, used to\r\ndestroy natural cheapness, was a Trojan horse bearing within itself\r\nthe deadliest form of dearness. Defeated, the oil lords gave up the\r\ncontest, closed their store in Columbus, and left the people of that\r\nplace free.\r\n\r\n\"England,\" says Emerson, \"reaches to the Alleghanies; America begins\r\nin Ohio.\" In the Western Reserve of Ohio, hive of abolitionists and\r\nUnion soldiers, was the same spirit of America which, at Columbus,\r\nMississippi, had defended its market rights as outposts of all other\r\nrights. It was only a few years ago discovered that the flames of the\r\n\"burning springs\" of the Caspian Sea, China, and America, whose torches\r\nkindled the lamp of history, were beacon-fires uncomprehended by a\r\nprocession of civilizations, and waiting to light man to the knowledge\r\nthat the earth beneath him was a city of domes, huge receivers storing\r\nup the products of vaster gas-retorts below. Man found that he need not\r\nwait for this spirit to come to him out of the \"caverns measureless to\r\nman.\" He could go to it, as in oil, and, tapping the great tanks, could\r\nlead their flighty contents to homes and mills, to emerge there as\r\nlight and warmth and power.\r\n\r\nExperience in oil had made ready skill and capital to use the new\r\ntreasure. In a very few years thousands of miles of pipe were laid, and\r\nmillions of capital invested in the natural-gas business, mainly in\r\nOhio and Pennsylvania. The gas was found in the same general localities\r\nas oil, and the methods of procuring and distributing it were similar,\r\nand the similarity easily extended to the methods of administering this\r\nbounty of nature as \"property.\" Toledo began to be supplied in 1887\r\nwith the new fuel through pipe lines by two companies. They obtained\r\ntheir franchises as competitors, but were soon found to be one in\r\nownership, prices, and all details of management. The discovery that\r\nthe two companies at Toledo were really one, and that one the evil one\r\nof the oil trust, aroused the apprehensions of the people, and these\r\nwere increased by a number of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Toledo companies got from the city as a free gift a franchise\r\nworth hundreds of thousands of dollars, on condition that they would\r\nsupply Toledo before a certain date. But in the midst of the work of\r\nlaying pipes they suspended operations, and declared that they would\r\ndo nothing more unless the City Council fixed, at rates dictated by\r\nthem, the prices the people were to pay. These rates were enough\r\nto pay not only a fair dividend, but to return in a few years every\r\ndollar of capital invested in lands, pipes, etc. Later they demanded\r\nanother increase which, according to the sworn statement by their\r\nsuperintendent of the amount of gas supplied daily, would have\r\namounted to $351,362.50 a year. They made the charges regardless of\r\nthe ordinance, and used delay in furnishing gas as a means to make\r\npeople willing to pay these illegal rates. Consumers seeking to renew\r\ntheir contracts were informed that the price would be doubled. The\r\ncompanies had assured the people that they should get their heat at\r\nhalf the price of coal; but when the bills were footed up, the gas in\r\nmany cases cost more than coal. The companies refused to supply fuel\r\nto an oil refinery which had been built in Toledo in opposition to the\r\ntrust refineries. The companies discriminated against some customers,\r\nand in favor of others. The power to say which manufacturer should\r\nhave cheaper fuel than his competitor was a power to enact prosperity\r\nor ruin.[513] It was a power to force themselves into control of any\r\nbusiness they desired to enter.\r\n\r\nThose who controlled these gas companies appeared in the Circuit Court\r\nof the city in a proceeding which alone contained warning enough to\r\nput any self-governing community on guard. The Court was asked to deny\r\nthe right of farmers in Wood County to give a way over their lands to\r\nthe Toledo, Findlay, and Springfield Railway, being built to give the\r\nindependent oil-refiners and producers of the Ohio oil-field a route to\r\nmarket. The farmers in question had made leases to an oil corporation\r\nof the trust, giving only the specific right to bore for and pipe and\r\nstore oil and gas. The farmers supposed that they had parted only with\r\nwhat they had signed away in the leases. They supposed they still owned\r\ntheir farms. When the new railroad sought the privilege of a right of\r\nway the farmers granted it. Suit was at once brought for an injunction\r\nto prevent this use of the land. According to the logic of the claim\r\nin these cases a farmer who has made such a lease could not build a\r\nroad across his own farm without permission. \"Most certainly not,\" was\r\nthe reply made by one of the lawyers to the judge who asked if the\r\nfarmer could do so.\r\n\r\nBy occurrences like these an increasing number of influential citizens\r\nwere convinced that the gas companies would hold a power over the\r\ncomfort and daily life of the people not wise to surrender entire to\r\nany corporation. An agitation was begun for the supply of gas to the\r\npeople by themselves acting through the municipality. Six thousand\r\ncitizens sent a petition, in the session of 1887-88, to the Legislature\r\nto pass the necessary enabling act. There was a discussion of the\r\nproject for two years. Public opinion grew more favorable every\r\nday. The citizens chartered a special train to carry a delegation\r\nto Columbus the day the pipe-line law came before the Senate. The\r\nLegislature in 1889 passed the law. It authorized the people of Toledo\r\nto issue bonds to the extent of $750,000 to buy gas land and build\r\npipe lines. This legislation was, of course, bitterly opposed by the\r\nexisting gas companies, and they demanded of the Legislature that\r\nbefore the law became operative it should be ratified by a three-fifths\r\nvote of the people. The friends of this scheme of municipal self-help\r\nand independence accepted the challenge. In the ensuing campaign the\r\nopposition to the people was officered by the president of one of the\r\nnatural-gas companies, twice Governor of Ohio, afterwards United States\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. The natural-gas trustees of the City of\r\nToledo in an official communication said: \"There is reason to believe\r\nthe money of the natural-gas companies was freely spent to defeat it.\"\r\n\r\nThe act was ratified April, 1889, by a vote of 7002 for to 4199\r\nagainst--\"a vote,\" say the trustees, \"in which the heavy taxpayers\r\nwere largely acting with the majority.\"[514] Organized labor took an\r\nenthusiastic part in the work of this election. The Central Labor Union\r\nheld a special meeting which filled the largest public hall. Men\r\nparaded the streets with banners favoring the policy of independence.\r\nThe Knights of Labor held meetings to discuss the project, and the\r\nCentral Council, representing all the assemblies in the city, passed\r\nunanimously resolutions appealing to all members of the order and all\r\nworking-men to support no candidate who would not pledge himself to\r\nthe city pipe line. At a meeting of the glassworkers it was resolved\r\nto be \"the duty of every working-man to vote 'Yes' for the pipe line\r\nnext Monday.\" \"Many of us glassworkers,\" said the resolutions adopted,\r\n\"have been employed in factories in the Ohio Valley, receiving their\r\nnatural-gas fuel from a gigantic corporation similar to that which now\r\nsupplies Toledo. We have seen our employers unfairly dealt with, and\r\narbitrarily treated in the matter of making rates. Some of them were\r\nforced to go into the courts, to prevent the extortion of the piratical\r\ncompany who were bent on assessing each citizen and industry at the\r\nhighest rate possible, irrespective of its effect on the industries or\r\nthe wages of the employés. Many manufacturers were compelled to move\r\ntheir plants to the cheap gas-fields of Ohio and Indiana. The employés\r\nwere compelled to break up their homes and emigrate, in order to follow\r\ntheir trade for a livelihood.\" The question came before the people\r\nagain the next spring, when both the Republican and Democratic parties\r\nby acclamation renominated a natural-gas trustee, whose term was\r\nexpiring, to succeed himself. At the election the vote was 8958 for,\r\nand only 58 against--a practically unanimous indorsement of the project\r\nby the people.\r\n\r\nToledo now began to make history. \"It is entirely safe to say,\" a\r\nwell-known citizen declared in the Toledo _Blade_, \"that in the history\r\nof this country no other people have been called to the experience\r\nwhich Toledo has been undergoing for the past year. Communities often\r\nare agitated and divided on questions of local policy; but no second\r\ncase will be found in which a people, after settling such questions\r\namong themselves according to recognized rules, were confronted with\r\nwarfare, bitter and persistent, such as this city is now called to\r\nmeet, and at the hands of a combination wholly of non-residents,\r\nwithout the slightest proper voice in their domestic concerns.\"\r\nIn every direct encounter with the \"commons\" the \"lords\" had been\r\ndefeated--in the two years' debate which preceded the first appeal to\r\nthe Legislature; in the Legislature, where the bill passed the House\r\nalmost unanimously, and the Senate more than two to one; in the appeal\r\nto the voters; before the governor, who had been approached to cripple\r\nthe enterprise of the municipality by naming unfriendly trustees. The\r\ngas companies had tried at each city election, after the Legislature\r\nacted in 1889, to seat in the City Council a majority in their\r\ninterest; but the people, making the city pipe line the issue of the\r\nelection, gave an overwhelming preponderance of their votes to the men\r\npledged to see it through.\r\n\r\n\"Strong and subtle opposition\"[515] was then brought to bear on the\r\nCommon Council to prevent it from passing the necessary ordinances;\r\nbut, in spite of it, both branches of the Council voted them\r\nunanimously. A clearer case of the will of the people and of law and\r\norder there could not be. A free and intelligent community, in a matter\r\nof vital concern to its industrial freedom and business prosperity,\r\nafter thorough discussion, in which all sides had been freely heard,\r\nhad by constitutional proceedings decided by an overwhelming majority\r\nupon a policy altogether within its legal, moral, and contract rights.\r\nThe ablest lawyers, writers, and financiers that money could hire had\r\nhad it under the microscope to find some breach for attack, but had not\r\nbeen able to find a flaw. All was constitutional, legal, proper, and\r\nexpedient. A glance at the contestants brings out in clear outlines\r\nsome conditions of our modern development which have come upon us\r\nalmost unawares. The City of Toledo was a vigorous community of 90,000\r\npeople; its opponent was a little group of men; but they controlled\r\nin one aggregation not less than $160,000,000, besides large affairs\r\noutside of this. The assessed valuations of the property of the people\r\non which Toledo could levy taxation was, in 1889, but $33,200,000.\r\nThe total income of the municipality was $961,101; that of a single\r\nmember of the little group opposing them had been acknowledged to\r\nbe $9,000,000 a year, and was believed by the best informed to be\r\nseveral times as much. This individual income was greater than the\r\nproduct of all the manufactories of the city, and three times greater\r\nthan the combined wages of the workmen in these establishments. There\r\nwere several members of the natural-gas syndicate who collected and\r\ndisbursed every year more than the community. Toledo had about the\r\nsame population as Kansas in 1856. The slave power of the South that\r\nassailed the liberties of the 90,000 in Kansas numbered millions, but\r\nthe new power in the North, which in a short generation had grown so\r\nstrong that it did not fear to attack the 90,000 freemen of Toledo,\r\ncounted only nine names. The people could act only after public\r\ndeliberation, and through the slow stages of municipal and State\r\nprocedure. Their antagonist met in secret council, and devised plans\r\nexecuted by a single hand, armed with the aggregated power of hundreds\r\nof millions of dollars, and liable, if found illegal or criminal, to\r\nonly \"nominal\" punishment, or only 6 cents damages.[516]\r\n\r\nAt Columbus the struggle was with something very simple but\r\nextraordinarily difficult to overcome, as simple things often are--an\r\nobstinate, immovable, thoroughly angry public opinion, acting only\r\nthrough private voluntary means, its set will to exchange the fruits of\r\nits labor with whom and on what terms it pleased. There was absolutely\r\nno leverage to be got to bear upon the people of Columbus except by\r\nchanging their feelings. Compulsion was out of the question. But at\r\nToledo compulsion was possible. There the people had acted not through\r\nunofficial combination as at Columbus, but through the official\r\nmachinery of the town and State. If the law could be turned against\r\nthem by able counsel or compliant judges; if any smallest fault,\r\nhowever technical, could be found in the legislation of the State or\r\nthe city or the practical administration of the official machinery\r\nprovided for the natural-gas business of the city--if this could be\r\ndone, the people of Toledo could be compelled, however little their\r\nwill had changed, to see their enterprise of independence balked; this\r\ncompulsion could be carried to the use of force if they resisted, and\r\nthe militia of the State and the regular army could be brought into the\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nSuch is the prize of power which tempts--more than tempts, drives as\r\nby fate--our overgrown wealth to fortify itself by control of judges,\r\ngovernors, presidents, commanders-in-chief--all the agents of the\r\nsupreme authority and force.\r\n\r\nColumbus was so local that its people were sufficient unto themselves.\r\nAll they had to do was to keep on saying, We will not buy. But Toledo\r\nwas a citizen of the great world of affairs and finance. It was part\r\nof London, New York, Chicago. Much of it was owned as an investment\r\nelsewhere. Sensitive nerves connected it with all the markets,\r\nespecially the greatest of all--the money-market. It sold and bought\r\nand borrowed and lent far beyond its own border. What Wall Street\r\ngossips said about the people of Columbus would not make a dollar's\r\ndifference to the whole town in a year, but a whisper started through\r\nthe offices of the great capitalists in New York and abroad would\r\nflash back by wire to Toledo, and go like a quick poison through its\r\nindustries and credit, private and public.\r\n\r\n\"Private enterprise\" could not afford to let the people of Toledo go\r\nforward with their public enterprise. Many millions had been invested\r\nin getting control of a business representing $200,000,000. Many\r\ntowns and cities, as Fostoria, Sandusky, Fremont, Clyde, Bellevue,\r\nNorwalk, Perrysburgh, Tiffin, and Detroit, were being supplied with\r\ngas at a handsome profit. If Toledo should set a successful example\r\nof self-supply, it would find imitators on every side. The essence of\r\n\"private enterprise\" was that the people should get their gas from\r\nCaptains of Industry, and pay them for their captaincy two or three\r\ntimes the real cost as profit, just as monarchical countries pay kings\r\nfor kindly supplying the people with the government which really comes\r\nfrom the people. The essence of municipal supply was that the people\r\nshould supply themselves at cost without profit, and without Captains\r\nof Industry, except as the people provided them. Toledo, in fine,\r\nproposed to keep step with the modern expansion of self-government,\r\nwhich finds that it can apply principles and methods of democracy\r\nto industry. It proposed to add another to many demonstrations\r\nalready made, noticeably in this very department of gas supply to\r\nmunicipalities, of the truth that the ability to carry on the business\r\nof supplying the various wants of mankind is not a sort of divine right\r\nvouchsafed from on high to a few specially inspired and gifted priests\r\nof commerce, by whose intermediation alone can the mysteries of trade\r\nbe operated; but, like the ability to govern and be governed, is one\r\nof the faculties common to mankind, capable of being administered of,\r\nby, and for the people, and not needing to be differentiated as the\r\nprerogative of one set of men. The Toledo experiment was another step\r\nforward in the world-wide movement for the abolition of millionaires--a\r\nmovement upon which the millionaires look with unconcealed apprehension\r\nfor the welfare of their fellow-beings.\r\n\r\nMankind views with equanimity the expulsion of the profit-hunter from\r\nthe businesses of carrying letters, minting coins, administering\r\njustice, maintaining highways, collecting taxes, in which\r\nmillionaireism has been universally put an end to. It views with hopes\r\nof larger results the newer manifestations of the same tendency which\r\nin England have abolished millionaireism in telegraphs and parcel\r\nexpress; in Germany and France, Australia, and India have gone a long\r\nway towards the abolition of the millionaire in railroads; and in\r\nvarious cities and towns in Europe, America, and Australia have put up\r\nlocal signs, \"No millionaires allowed here,\" by the municipalization of\r\ntrade in water, gas, electricity, street-railways, baths, laundries,\r\nlibraries, etc. The trust of millionaires was therefore fighting for a\r\nprinciple, and what will good men not sacrifice to principle!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF THE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nTowns, like men, stamp themselves with marked traits. Toledo had an\r\nindividuality which showed itself from the start. Its leading men\r\nclubbed together and borrowed money as early as 1832 to build one of\r\nthe first railroads constructed west of the Alleghanies--the Erie and\r\nKalamazoo, to connect Toledo and Adrian. When, in 1845, the steamboats\r\non the lakes formed a combination, and discriminated against Toledo,\r\nthe city through its council refused to submit, and appropriated\r\n$10,000 to get an independent boat to Buffalo. The city appropriated\r\nits credit and revenues to other important and costly enterprises,\r\nincluding four railroads, to keep it clear of the cruel mercies of\r\nprivate ownership of the highways. In 1889 it expended $200,000 to\r\nsecure direct railway connections with the Pennsylvania and the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio railways for competition in rates with the Lake\r\nShore Railroad.\r\n\r\nAs it had been authorized to do so by the State, the City Council of\r\nToledo, April 29, 1889, ordered gas bonds to the amount of $75,000\r\nsold, that work on the city pipe line might begin. Before proceeding\r\nwith the enterprise confided to them, the natural-gas trustees gave\r\nthe private companies an opportunity to save themselves from the\r\ncompetition of the city. They asked them in writing if they would agree\r\nto furnish gas cheaply for a term of years, or if they would sell\r\ntheir entire plant to the city? They did this, as they expressed it,\r\nas \"an honorable effort ... to obtain cheaper gas without unnecessary\r\nexpenditure, and without injury to established rights.\" After a\r\ndelay of nearly a month a reply was received, refusing to enter into\r\nnegotiations either for a reduction of charges or for the sale of the\r\nprivate plants to the city. The trustees then asked for a personal\r\ninterview, but this was refused. Then when the city began preparations\r\nto sell its bonds, a cannonade was opened on it in the courts, the\r\nmoney-market, the gas-fields, the city government, the press, among\r\nthe citizens, and everywhere. Injunctions were applied for in three\r\ncourts, unsuccessfully in all instances. No injunction was ever granted\r\nin these or any other of the many suits brought for the purpose of\r\nenjoining the sale of the bonds. Courts will usually grant temporary\r\ninjunctions awaiting a hearing on the merits when complainants will\r\nenter into ample bonds and indemnify defendants. But the parties\r\ninstigating this litigation would not put up the necessary bonds. They\r\nthus could smirch the bonds without incurring any personal liability in\r\nso doing.\r\n\r\nAn expensive array of lawyers was sent before the United States\r\ncourts to prevent the issue of the bonds on the ground that they were\r\nillegal, and the law under which they were issued unconstitutional.\r\nThe principle involved had been frequently discussed and always upheld\r\nboth by the Supreme Court of Ohio and the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.[517]\r\n\r\n\"Does not your argument appear to be in conflict with the views of the\r\nSupreme Court of Ohio and the Supreme Court of the United States?\" the\r\njudge asked. The counsel for the gas companies responded in substance:\r\n\"If so, then so much the worse for the views of those courts.\"\r\n\r\nAs it was through the suffrage that the people of Toledo were able to\r\ndo this, the attack was widened from an attack on the enterprise to one\r\nupon the sovereignty of the citizens which made it possible. \"Everybody\r\nvotes in Ohio--in fact, too many people,\" said the lawyer who applied\r\nfor an injunction against Toledo. If he had his way, he declared, there\r\nwould be fewer voters, and he stigmatized the arguments of Toledo as\r\nthose of John Most, the communist.\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably,\" decided Judge Jackson, \"the Legislature may\r\nauthorize a city to furnish light, or facilities for transportation, or\r\nwater to its citizens, with or without cost, as the Legislature or city\r\nmay determine.... Since the decision in Sharpless _vs._ Philadelphia\r\nit is no longer an open question whether municipalities may engage in\r\nenterprises such as the one contemplated by the act in question in this\r\ncase. The act of January 22, 1889, authorizing the city of Toledo to\r\nissue bonds for natural-gas purposes, is clearly within the general\r\nscope of legislative power, is for a public use and purpose, and is\r\nnot in contravention of any of the provisions of the constitution. The\r\ncourt being of the opinion that the legislation is valid, it follows,\r\nof course, that the injunction applied for must be refused.\"[518] When\r\nthe news of Judge Jackson's decision was telegraphed to Toledo nothing\r\nless than the booming of cannon could express the joy of the citizens.\r\nThey sent this message to the just judge: \"One hundred guns were fired\r\nto-night by the citizens of Toledo in honor of your righteous decision\r\nto-day.\" Judge Jackson again upheld the bonds at Toledo, January 14,\r\n1890, when he again dismissed the case against the city \"for want of\r\nequity, at cost of complainants.\"\r\n\r\nThe favorable decision by Judge Jackson, although an appeal was taken,\r\nmade it possible for the city to sell the $75,000 bonds which had been\r\nissued by order of the Council. The bonds brought par, interest, and\r\nover $2000 premium. With the money thus procured the city's Board of\r\nNatural Gas Trustees began operations. Their opponents had spread far\r\nand loud among the voters before the election--among those who would\r\nbe likely to buy the bonds, everywhere it would hurt--the assertion\r\nthat all the territory that was good had been bought up by them, and\r\nthe city's trustees would not be able to get any. One of the companies\r\nhad no less than 140,000 acres of gas lands in its possession or under\r\ncontract, at a cost in rentals and royalties of $100,000 a year.[519]\r\nBut the city trustees, even with the small sum at their command, were\r\nable to secure at the very beginning wells with a capacity more than\r\nfour times as great as the private companies had had when the latter\r\nbegan the investment of a million or more to lay their pipe lines to\r\nToledo.[520] Together with this supply the city trustees got 650 acres\r\nabout 35 miles from Toledo of as choice gas territory as there was in\r\nOhio, almost all of it undrilled, and they had offers amounting to 5000\r\nacres more within piping distance from the city. The city's trustees\r\nmade their purchases with success, and received the laudations of their\r\nconstituents for having got lands and wells at better prices than the\r\nprivate companies.\r\n\r\nAugust 26, 1889, after a decision in the United States courts that\r\nthere was no ground on which to object to the issue of the bonds, the\r\nCity Council voted the issue of the remaining $675,000.\r\n\r\nDefeated in the public debate which preceded the decision of Toledo\r\nto supply itself; defeated at the State Capitol; defeated at the\r\npolls of Toledo time and again--every time; defeated in the Common\r\nCouncil; defeated in the gas-fields; defeated in the courts of their\r\nown choosing, the opponents of the city, thorough as only the very good\r\nor the very bad can be, refused to submit. When the two corporations,\r\nin 1886, were seeking the franchise indispensable for doing business\r\nin Toledo, they said to the Board of Aldermen: \"We ask no exclusive\r\nprivilege.... We cannot have too many gas companies.\" They also said:\r\n\"If the city desires to furnish its own gas, there is nothing in this\r\nordinance to hinder it. We are ready and willing at any time to enter\r\ninto competition with the city or any other company.\" They said, on\r\nthe same occasion, in answer to apprehensions which had been expressed\r\nabout the danger of putting the fuel supply of the city into the hands\r\nof a monopoly: \"You can go before the Legislature and obtain the right\r\nto issue bonds for furnishing yourselves with gas.\" It was by these\r\nassurances the companies induced the Common Council to grant them\r\ngratuitously the very valuable franchises they were seeking.\r\n\r\nThe right of the people to compete was not left to these assurances.\r\nIt was specifically and formally asserted in the ordinance of July 5,\r\n1887, fixing rates. This was the ordinance to procure which the gas\r\ncompany suspended its operations in mid-course, and declared it would\r\nnot continue unless the prices which it wanted were made. The ordinance\r\nwas, in fact, prepared by the company. It said: \"Provided that nothing\r\nherein contained shall be construed as granting to existing companies\r\nany exclusive rights or privileges, or prevent any other company from\r\nfurnishing natural gas to the citizens of said city.\" But the same\r\nlearned counsel who, in behalf of the companies, had assured the city\r\nthat \"there was nothing in this ordinance to hinder it,\" went before\r\nthe United States Court and pleaded that ordinance as good reason for\r\nthe intervention of the Federal Government to prevent the city from\r\ngoing on with its enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe only morning paper--an able advocate of the city pipe\r\nline--suddenly changed owners and opinions. Among its new directors\r\nwere two of the lawyers of the trust opposing the city, a director\r\nin one of its companies, and, besides them, the manager, a contract\r\neditor from Pennsylvania. His sole conspicuity there had been won in\r\nturning against the people of the oil regions a paper which had been\r\ntheir stanchest defender. This Toledo daily, in its espousal of the\r\ncause of the city, had been firing hot shot like this against the oil\r\ncombination: \"It wants a monopoly of the natural-gas business. This\r\nis what it is driving at.\" Under its new management it roared like a\r\nsucking dove, thus: \"It is fashionable with demagogues and men who are\r\nnot capable of appreciating the worth of brains in business to howl\r\nagainst it\"--the oil combination--\"as a grasping, grinding monopoly.\"\r\nJust after the people had decided in favor of the pipe line, and only\r\na few days before it changed owners, it had said: \"All manner of\r\ninfluences were brought to bear to defeat this proposition.... All the\r\nplausible falsehoods that could be invented, and all the money that\r\ncould be used, were industriously employed, but the people saw the\r\nsituation in its true light, and the majority voted right.\" It now made\r\nthe defeat of the city's pipe line the chief aim of its endeavors. In\r\nthis work \"no rule or principle recognized in decent journalism was\r\nrespected.\"\r\n\r\nIn all the history of Toledo no interest on its bonds had ever been\r\ndefaulted or delayed; no principal ever unpaid at maturity. The city\r\nwas prosperous, its growth steady; its debt growing less year by year\r\nin proportion to its population and wealth. Its bonds ranked among the\r\nchoicest investments, and commanded a premium in the money-market.[521]\r\nBut the credit and fair fame of the city were now over-whelmed with\r\nwholesale vituperation by this paper, and others elsewhere under\r\nsimilar control. Articles were carefully prepared for this purpose by\r\nskilled writers. These were then copied from one newspaper to another.\r\nBy some arrangement insertion was obtained for them in financial\r\njournals in New York and in London, and in other foreign capitals.\r\nThe Toledo organ declared that Toledo was an unsafe place for the\r\ninvestment of capital in any form. Its public affairs were said to be\r\nrun by a set of \"demagogues and speculators,\" whose administration was\r\n\"piratical mob rule.\" The city pipe line was a \"monstrous job,\" and the\r\nmen who favored it were \"a gang of throttlers and ravenous wolves.\"\r\nThey were \"blatant demagogues, who made great pretence of advancing\r\nthe city's interest, but whose real aim is to enrich themselves at\r\npublic expense.\" The bonds, which had been issued in due form by\r\nspecial authority of the Legislature, ratified by a vote of more than\r\nthree-fifths of the citizens, and declared to be valid by the United\r\nStates Court, were described as \"chromos,\" \"worthless rags,\" \"bad\r\nmedicine,\" \"disfigured securities,\" \"like rotten eggs, highly odorous\r\ngoods,\" \"but few persons at most can be found ignorant enough to buy\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mayor, City Auditor, Board of Natural Gas Trustees, united with\r\na citizens' committee of the Board of Trade in a plan to promote the\r\nsale of the bonds direct to the people of Toledo through a financial\r\ninstitution of the highest standing. This action the paper described\r\nas \"a scheme for gulling simples,\" \"a blind pool,\" \"an unpatented\r\nfinancial deadfall\"; compared it with \"gambling, pool-playing, and\r\nlottery selling.\" These grave charges were widely circulated throughout\r\nthe country. Bankers and capitalists in other cities who received them\r\nhad no means of knowing that they were not what they pretended to\r\nbe--the honest if uncouth utterances of an independent press chastising\r\nthe follies of its own constituency. Newspapers which supported the\r\ncity's project were assailed as ruthlessly as the community and\r\ncitizens. The _Blade_ was constantly referred to as \"The Bladder.\"\r\nAnother journal was given a nickname too vulgar to be printed here. One\r\nof the most prominent journals of Ohio was punished by the following\r\nparagraph, which is a fair sample of the literary style of monopoly:\r\n\"That aged, acidulous addle-pate, the monkey-eyed, monkey-browed\r\nmonogram of sarcasm, and spider-shanked, pigeon-witted public\r\nscold, Majah Bilgewater Bickham, and his backbiting, black-mailing,\r\npatent-medicine directory, the _Journal_.\"\r\n\r\nAn old journalist and honorable citizen who wrote over his initials,\r\n\"C.W.,\" a series of able and dignified letters in the _Blade_, which\r\nhad a great influence in the formation of public opinion in favor\r\nof the pipe line, was assailed with \"brutal falsifier,\" \"hoary old\r\nreprobate,\" \"senile old liar.\" Caricatures were published depicting the\r\nbuyers of the bonds as \"simple greens.\" When the County Court of Lucas\r\nCounty, following the United States Court, sustained the bonds on their\r\nmerits, and did so on every point in question, because, as the judge\r\nstated, \"the equities of the case are with the defendants,\" the organ\r\nfalsely stated that judgment for the city was given \"because the merits\r\nof the case are involved in a higher court.\" When a capitalist of New\r\nYork, who had been an investor in the bonds of Toledo and a taxpayer\r\nthere for twenty-five years--one of the streets of the city was named\r\nfor him--bought $10,000 of the city pipe-line bonds, the paper attacked\r\nhim by name in an article headed \"Bunco Game,\" charging him with being\r\na party to a bunco game in connection with \"public till-tappers\" for\r\n\"roping Toledo citizens into buying doubtful securities.\" When the\r\nSinking Fund Commissioners of Toledo very properly invested some of the\r\ncity's money in the gas bonds, they were held up by name as \"public\r\ntill-tappers,\" \"menials\" of a \"hungry horde\" of \"boodle politicians,\"\r\naccomplices of \"plunderers of the public treasury,\" unable to withstand\r\n\"the brutal threats and snaky entreaties of the corrupt gas ring.\" For\r\none of the associate editors the position of Deputy State Inspector\r\nof Oil was obtained--an appointment which cost the Governor who made\r\nit many votes in the next election, and did much to defeat him. Such\r\nan appointment might give a versatile employé the chance to do double\r\nduty: as editor to brand as bad good men who could not be bought, and\r\nas inspector to brand as good bad oil for sale.[522]\r\n\r\nOne of the means taken to defeat the pipe line was the publication of\r\nvery discouraging accounts of the \"failure\" at Indianapolis, where the\r\ncitizens had refused to give a natural-gas company belonging to the\r\noil trust the franchise it demanded, and, forming an anti-monopoly\r\ntrust, had undertaken to supply themselves. Some \"influence\" prevented\r\nthe Common Council of Toledo from sending a committee to Indianapolis\r\nto investigate. A public-spirited citizen, prominent and successful\r\nin business, came forward, and at his own expense secured a full and\r\naccurate account of the experience of Indianapolis for the city.\r\nThis proved that the people were getting their fuel gas at less than\r\none-half what Toledo was paying. The contest against giving the\r\nIndianapolis franchise to a corporation of the trust had been a sharp\r\none. Its success was due to the middle classes and the working-men,\r\nwho stood together for freedom, incorruptible by all the powerful\r\ninfluences employed. \"We will burn soft coal all our lives,\" one of\r\ntheir leaders told the Toledo committee, \"rather than put ourselves in\r\nthe power of such men.\"\r\n\r\nIn Indiana the Legislature meets only once in two years, and when this\r\nissue arose had adjourned, and would not meet again for a year. The\r\npeople, not being able to get authority for a municipal gas pipe line,\r\nwent to work by voluntary co-operation. Every voting precinct in the\r\ncity was organized and canvassed for the capital needed. The shares\r\nwere $25 each, and they were bought up so rapidly that the entire\r\namount--$550,000--was subscribed in sixteen days by 4700 persons,\r\nwithout a cent of cost to the city. When subscriptions to the amount of\r\n$550,000 had been raised, $600,000 more was borrowed on certificates of\r\nindebtedness.\r\n\r\nGas lands were bought and 200 miles of pipe lines laid, all at a cost\r\nof about $1,200,000. The income in one year, during a part of which the\r\nsystem was still under construction, was $349,347. In the first year of\r\ncomplete operations the Indianapolis people's trust paid off $90,000\r\nof the principal. The income for the year ending October 31, 1892,\r\nwas $483,258.21, and the bonded debt has been paid. The stock, since\r\nJanuary 1, 1893, has been paying dividends at the rate of 8 per cent. a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nA prominent citizen of Indianapolis, one of the State judges, told the\r\nToledo papers, in an interview: \"The private companies had their gas\r\nlaid to the city and along the streets several months in advance of the\r\nCitizens' Trust, but it did them little good. Everybody said: 'I will\r\nwait for the Consumers' Trust.' 'Yes, but we will furnish you gas just\r\nas cheap,' said the Indianapolis company; 'why not take it of us?' To\r\nthis the citizens replied: 'To take gas of you means cheap gas to-day,\r\nbut high gas to-morrow.' And wait for the gas they all did.\" The charge\r\nto manufacturers was 2-1/2 cents a thousand feet, as against 8 cents,\r\nat that time charged at Toledo. There were 12,000 private consumers.\r\nCooking-stoves in Indianapolis were about $12 a year, against $19.50\r\nin Toledo. One of the representatives of the private company declared\r\nat a public meeting at Indianapolis that its charges were made\r\nsuch as to give a full return of all the invested capital in three\r\nyears, as that was the probable life of the supply. A year after the\r\ninauguration of the Indianapolis movement a committee of the citizens\r\nat Dayton, who had risen against the extortionate prices charged them,\r\ninvestigated the condition of affairs at Indianapolis. They reported\r\nthat Indianapolis had paid $200,000 on its bonded debt, and was getting\r\nready to pay as much more. The Consumers' Trust supplied between 10,000\r\nand 11,000 consumers, and spent $1,000,000 less than the Dayton private\r\ncompany spent to supply 3000 fewer consumers. The annual charge at\r\nDayton was $54.80; at Indianapolis only $26.80--less than half.\r\n\r\nWhen facts like these were brought out, to the demolition of the\r\nfictions circulated in Toledo, the answer was characteristic. The\r\n\"organ\" could not deny the statements, but it fell upon the citizen\r\nthrough whose generosity the information had been got for the people,\r\nand assailed his private character in articles which, one of the daily\r\npapers declared, editorially, \"would almost, if not quite, justify him\r\nin shooting their author on sight.\"\r\n\r\nThis newspaper charged the city natural-gas trustees with being \"rotten\r\nto the core,\" and with every variation of phrase possible to its\r\nexuberant rhetoric sounded the changes upon their official career as a\r\n\"big steal,\" \"fostered by deception, falsehood, and skull-duggery.\" It\r\nsought to intimidate the Legislature and the courts when they failed\r\nto enact or construe laws against the people. It said: \"Law-makers,\r\njudges, and others may feel the force of this element when the proper\r\ntime comes and political preferment is sought.\"\r\n\r\nIt was money in pocket that facts like those of the experience of\r\nIndianapolis, Detroit, and other places should not be made known. Even\r\nideas must not be allowed to reach the public mind. Professor Henry C.\r\nAdams, the well-known political economist, lectured in Toledo during\r\nthis contest, in a University Extension Course, on \"Public Commissions\r\nConsidered as the Conservative Solution of the Monopoly Problem.\" The\r\n\"organ\" gave a synopsis of the lecturer's views, which is printed\r\nherewith in parallel columns, with a synopsis of what Mr. Adams really\r\nsaid, as revised by himself:\r\n\r\n\r\n WHAT THE ORGAN OF MONOPOLY REPORTED.    | WHAT THE LECTURER REALLY SAID.\r\n                                         |\r\n The lecturer made reference to Toledo   |Professor Adams thought the\r\n as an unfavorable place to discuss      |solution of the monopoly problem\r\n the matter of municipal control of      |must be found either in public\r\n quasi-public business and competition   |control or in public ownership.\r\n of municipalities with private          |He advocated public control, and\r\n corporations.

He said, however,\r\n                                         |that if anything should be owned\r\n                                         |and controlled by and for the\r\n                                         |people it would be\r\n                                         |street-railroads, gas and\r\n                                         |waterworks. He admonished his\r\n                                         |audience not to be misled by the\r\n                                         |argument that municipal ownership\r\n                                         |would be dangerous because of\r\n                                         |undue political influence, for\r\n                                         |the local monopolies under\r\n                                         |private ownership were already in\r\n                                         |politics, and in a most dangerous\r\n                                         |manner. He observed facetiously\r\n                                         |that he hesitated to discuss the\r\n                                         |question before a of municipal\r\n                                         |control orownership Toledo\r\n                                         |audience.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the control of the markets to the control of the minds of a\r\npeople--this is the line of march.\r\n\r\nSo direct, persistent, and bold were the charges of corruptions rung\r\nday after day by this journal against all the officials concerned\r\nin the city gas enterprise that some people began to believe there\r\nmust be truth in them. But when the community at last turned upon\r\nits maligners, and the grand-jury brought indictments against the\r\nactive manager of the paper and his chief assistant for criminal\r\nlibel upon the city's natural-gas trustees, the whole structure of\r\ntheir falsehood went down at a breath. They had no defence whatever.\r\nThey made no attempt to justify their libels or even explain them.\r\nTheir only defence was a series of motions to get the indicted editor\r\ncleared as not being responsible for what had appeared in the paper.\r\nCounsel labored over the contention that the accused was none of the\r\nthings which the language of the law holds for libel. He was neither\r\nthe \"proprietor,\" \"publisher,\" \"editor,\" \"printer,\" \"author,\" nor a\r\nperson \"who uttered, gave, sold, or lent\" a copy of the newspaper,\r\nbut only the \"manager.\" The employés gave testimony which would have\r\nbeen ludicrous but for the contempt it showed for court and community.\r\nThe journalist who was the \"managing editor\" of the paper under the\r\nindicted chief editor was asked:\r\n\r\n\"Who was the head of the paper when you entered upon your duties as\r\nmanaging editor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who hired you as managing editor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really can't say that I was hired at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who employed you to come to Toledo?\" The witness had been an employé\r\nin Pennsylvania of the editor on trial, and had followed the latter to\r\nToledo to take the place of managing editor. \"Nobody employed me.\"\r\n\r\nThe son of the indicted editor had also followed his father to Toledo,\r\nand was employed on his paper. Asked for what purpose he came, he said:\r\n\"I had no purpose in coming.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who had charge of the counting-room was asked who fixed\r\nhis salary.\r\n\r\n\"I regulate my own.\"\r\n\r\nThe advertising manager declared:\r\n\r\n\"I have no knowledge who is my superior.\"\r\n\r\nThe accused had to let the case go to the jury without a spark of proof\r\nof the accusations which had filled the paper every day for months.\r\nHe had no evidence to offer either that the charges were true, or\r\nthat he believed them to be true. He stood self-confessed as having\r\nfor years printed daily gross libels on citizens, officials, and\r\ncommunity, as part of the tactics of a few outside men to prevent a\r\nfree city from doing with its own means in its own affairs that which\r\nan overwhelming public opinion, and the legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial authorities, and its present antagonists themselves, had all\r\nsustained its right to do. The agent of this wrong was found guilty,\r\nand sentenced to imprisonment in the county jail, with heavy costs and\r\nfine; like the unhappy agents at Buffalo--\"made cheap\" for others.[523]\r\nBut sentence was suspended pending hearing of the motion for a new\r\ntrial. This did not come up for a year. The court could find no error\r\nin the proceedings of the trial court, and could not sustain any of the\r\nobjections made. But it found a point which even the lawyers had not\r\nhit on, and strained this far enough to grant the new trial. Then the\r\nconvicted editor went before another judge--not the one who had tried\r\nhim--pleaded guilty, and was fined, and so saved from jail.\r\n\r\nOne of the last scenes in this Waterloo was the abandonment of the\r\nnewspaper with which the corruption and intimidation of public opinion\r\nhad been attempted. Failure was confessed by the sale of the paper, and\r\nit was bought by a journalist who had been especially prominent in the\r\ndefence of the city, and against whom on that account a bitter warfare\r\nhad been waged by the daily which now passed into his possession. The\r\n_Sunday Journal_ of Toledo, in commenting on the surrender, declared\r\nthat the course of the organ had been one of the strongest factors of\r\nthe success of the people. \"In every possible way it slandered and\r\noutraged the city, where of necessity it looked for support. There\r\ncould be but one result. Scores who had opposed the pipe line became\r\nits most ardent advocates purely in the general defence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nHIGH FINANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Judge Jackson refused to enjoin the city from issuing its bonds an\r\nappeal was taken. The court and the lawyers of the city were promised\r\nthat it would be carried up without delay. Months passed, and no use\r\nwas made of the privilege of filing new pleadings and taking new\r\ntestimony--that is, no use but to make the suits the basis for libels\r\non Toledo and its bonds.\r\n\r\nTime ran on until the day was at hand for opening bids for the bonds.\r\nThat was to be Wednesday. Then the counsel for the opposition notified\r\nthe city that on Monday they would begin the taking of depositions.\r\nThis was not then or afterwards done, but on the strength of the\r\nnotification news despatches were sent over the country that the\r\nproceedings against the legality of the Toledo bonds were being\r\n\"pressed.\" In consequence of this and other manoeuvres, when Wednesday\r\ncame there were no bids. A hasty rally of some public-spirited\r\ncapitalists at home, learning of the emergency, made up a subscription\r\nof $300,000. The names of the citizens who made this patriotic\r\nsubscription were printed in the daily paper under the heading of \"The\r\nHonor Roll.\"\r\n\r\nOnly by extraordinary manoeuvres could the market for such securities\r\noffered by such a community have been thus killed in a time of great\r\ngeneral and local prosperity, and extraordinary they were. What they\r\nwere was formally and authoritatively ascertained by an investigation\r\nmade by a committee appointed at a mass-meeting[524] of the citizens\r\nof Toledo called by the mayor, the Hon. J.K. Hamilton. The call ran:\r\n\r\n \"For the first time in the history of Toledo, its general bonds,\r\n secured by the faith and property of the city, and bearing a fair rate\r\n of interest, have been offered, and only such of them sold as were\r\n taken at home by popular subscription. It is deemed desirable that\r\n under such circumstances the citizens of Toledo should meet together\r\n and determine what further steps should be taken to carry out the will\r\n of the people as expressed by 62 per cent. of the voters of the city.\r\n\r\n \"It is believed that with proper effort a large additional popular\r\n subscription may be obtained, and thus notice given to the world that\r\n notwithstanding all opposition the citizens of Toledo have confidence\r\n in and will maintain the credit of this fair city, and that a great\r\n enterprise undertaken by its people will not be defeated by the\r\n machinations of private opposing interests, no matter how powerful and\r\n unscrupulous.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting appointed a committee of three--David Robinson, Jr., Frank\r\nJ. Scott, and Albert E. Macomber--\"to prepare and circulate throughout\r\nthe financial circles of the country a pamphlet which shall set forth\r\nthe case of the city of Toledo in its struggle against those who by\r\nanonymous circulars and other dishonorable ways have attempted to\r\nprevent the sale of the Toledo natural-gas bonds.\" This committee put\r\nthe facts before the public in a very able pamphlet, \"The City of\r\nToledo and Its Natural Gas Bonds.\" In an official statement asked for\r\nby this committee the city natural-gas trustees say: \"Skilled writers\r\nwere employed to furnish articles for Eastern financial journals, to\r\ncast discredit on the bonds on the very grounds that had been set\r\naside by Judge Jackson's decision. Not content with this open warfare,\r\nanonymous circulars were sent to leading investment agencies in the\r\nUnited States, warning them to beware of these bonds, as they were\r\nunder the cloud of doubtful constitutionality and an impending lawsuit.\r\nWhen the day arrived for bidding for the bonds no bids were made.\r\nAgents of investors were present, who came to bid, but by some unknown\r\nand powerful influence they were induced not to put in their bids. The\r\nwriters are not aware that any similar mode of striking at the credit\r\nof a whole community was ever before resorted to in this country.\r\nIt is an insult and a wrong not only to this city, against which it\r\nis aimed, but to people of independence everywhere in the United\r\nStates who have a common interest in the maintenance of the rights of\r\nall.\"[525]\r\n\r\nPress despatches impugning the validity of the bonds and\r\nmisrepresenting the facts were sent all over the country. The anonymous\r\ncirculars referred to were mailed to all the leading banks, investment\r\nagencies, capitalists, and newspapers. The New York _Mail and Express_\r\nsaid: \"It would be decidedly interesting to know who is responsible\r\nfor the ... methods by which it was thought to prevent the city from\r\nundertaking the enterprise. A number of volunteer attorneys and\r\ncorrespondents deluged bankers and newspapers with letters warning them\r\nagainst the bonds which the city proposes to issue, on the ground that\r\nit had no right to issue them. The _Mail and Express_ received several\r\ncommunications of this kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not only the financial centres of this country,\" say the city's\r\nnatural-gas trustees in their official report for 1890, \"but those\r\nof Europe were invaded with these circulars.\"[526] The circular was\r\nheaded \"Caveat Emptor.\" It contained twenty-four questions, and every\r\none of the answers, except those which referred to matters of record\r\nand routine, like the date, amount, name, etc., of the bonds, was\r\nincorrect. What hurt the people of Toledo most, as it was most base\r\nand baseless, was its attack on their hitherto unquestioned credit and\r\nfinancial honor. Asking the question, \"How does the credit of the city\r\nstand?\" the circular answered: \"Refunding has been going on ever since\r\n1883. The bonded debt was greater at the beginning of 1889 than of\r\n1888; bonds bearing interest at 8 per cent. will become due in three or\r\nfour years. The mayor, in his last annual message, admits the inability\r\nof the city to pay much of these except the refunding.\" \"Willing to\r\nwound, and yet afraid to strike,\" the authors of this attempt to pull\r\ndown an entire city managed, by the interweaving of such phrases as\r\n\"ever since 1883,\" \"bonded debt greater,\" \"inability of the city to\r\npay,\" to create by insinuation the feeling of financial distrust for\r\nwhich their greatest industry and ingenuity had been able to find not a\r\nparticle of foundation. No modern municipality is asked or expected or\r\ndesired \"to pay much except the refunding.\" Capitalists would greatly\r\nprefer that even the refunding should not be carried on, but that the\r\ndebt should run along at the original high rates of interest, which\r\nthey regretfully see dwindling away. The circular failed to state that\r\nthe city was borrowing money at 4 per cent. to pay off debts bearing 8\r\nper cent. The insinuations of the circular could have been used of \"the\r\ncredit\" of the United States, New York, Paris, London, Chicago, with\r\nthe same appropriateness--with this exception, that Toledo's municipal\r\nfinancial credit was relatively to its resources on a sounder and more\r\nconservative basis than these much more highly financed cities. The\r\ncircular did not state that the proportions of debt to population had\r\nbeen decreasing for many years past.[527]\r\n\r\n\"Toledo has not two years' supply of gas,\" the circular said, \"in all\r\nthe territory acquired.\" The State Geologist, in his annual report\r\nfor 1890, said that Toledo would have no gas to supply its pipe lines\r\nor citizens in 1891. In 1892 the city pipe line supplied gas to the\r\nvalue of $168,954.46. Three years have passed, Toledo wells still flow,\r\nand new ones are being found continually. \"Whatever may have been his\r\nobject,\" say the city gas trustees, \"in volunteering such a statement,\r\nwe know that so far in 1891 it is untrue, and that such positive\r\ndeclarations, based upon hypothetical conditions, are utterly unworthy\r\nof scientific pretensions.\"[528] The State Geologist also took part in\r\nhis annual report in the debate between municipal control and private\r\nenterprise, siding altogether with the latter.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of gas land owned by the city was put by the circular at\r\n300 to 500 acres. The city had 650 acres. The circular declared the\r\nlife of an ordinary well to be one to three years. There is no such\r\nlimit. Referring to the quantity of gas land the city had, the circular\r\nasked and answered:\r\n\r\n\"Cannot other territory be acquired?\r\n\r\n\"Not in Northwestern Ohio, and not nearer than the gas fields of\r\nIndiana.\"\r\n\r\nThis was untrue, for the gas trustees had already been offered, as\r\nstated, several thousands of acres of the best gas lands in addition\r\nto those they had bought. But the authors of the circular did their\r\nbest to make it true. The city's natural-gas trustees say in their\r\nreport for 1890: \"As soon as the trustees were prepared to negotiate\r\nfor gas wells and gas territory, the field swarmed with emissaries and\r\nagents of the Northwestern Ohio Natural Gas Company to compete with\r\nthe trustees. In order to prove what had been previously stated, 'that\r\nToledo could procure no gas territory,' no means were left untried;\r\nagents of that company even fraudulently represented themselves to the\r\nowners of gas property that they were connected with the gas trustees\r\nand working in their interest, and in some instances introducing\r\nthemselves as the president of this board. Prices went up 1000 per\r\ncent. in some instances rather than let it fall into the hands of the\r\ntrustees. A conspicuous officer of that company, as an excuse for\r\npaying an enormous sum of money for a gas well, is reported as saying,\r\n'We did not want the gas well, but we had to buy it in order to keep\r\nToledo from getting hold of it.'\"[529]\r\n\r\nReferring to the private companies, \"Are the people of the city already\r\nsupplied with natural gas for public and private use?\" the circular\r\nasked. \"They are,\" it answered, and goes on: \"Why does the city want\r\nto go into the natural-gas business, then?\" \"To boom the lands of\r\nreal-estate speculators.\" This is a charge affecting the Legislature\r\nand Executive and State courts of Ohio, the courts of the United\r\nStates, the people of Toledo, and all the members of their city\r\ngovernment. Burke confessed that he did not know how to draw up an\r\nindictment against a whole people. That art has been acquired since his\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Are these bonds of unquestionable validity?\" this catechism of libel\r\nupon a community queries.\r\n\r\n\"By no means. Prominent taxpayers have suits pending attacking the\r\nconstitutionality of the act under which they are issued.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have these cases,\" the last question ran, \"ever been tried on their\r\nmerits?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have not.\"\r\n\r\nThey had been tried so far that the United States and State courts had\r\nrefused on every ground urged to interfere with their issue and sale,\r\ndeclaring the legislation authorizing them to be valid. They had never\r\nbeen tried any further in the United States courts for a very good--or\r\nbad--reason. The \"prominent taxpayers,\" after their defeat before Judge\r\nJackson, took every possible means to prevent the case from reaching a\r\nfinal adjudication. The invariable rule of the United States Supreme\r\nCourt has been to treat as final and conclusive the decisions of State\r\ncourts as to such domestic issues. During the hundred years of its\r\nexistence not a case can be found in which that court has overruled\r\nthe fixed and received construction given to a State law by the courts\r\nof that State.[530] The only hope for the suit of the \"prominent\r\ntaxpayers\" was, therefore, that the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nwould for their special profit reverse the practice to which it had\r\nconsistently adhered since the establishment of the government. What\r\nthey really thought of their prospect of success in that effort they\r\nconfessed when their case, no longer delayable, was upon the point of\r\nbeing reached.\r\n\r\nThey who had been so \"anxious to get to the case as soon as possible\"\r\nrefrained from printing the record, a condition precedent to putting\r\nthe case on the docket of the United States Supreme Court. The city\r\nwanted the decision, and in order that the case might not be dismissed\r\nfor this failure to print the record, and a decision upon the merits be\r\nthus prevented, the city's gas trustees advanced the money--$1100--to\r\nthe court printer for printing the record. Pushed thus against their\r\nwill to trial, when the day came on which they must rise to state their\r\ncase the opponents of Toledo folded their tents and stole silently\r\naway. On the motion of their attorney the case was dismissed, against\r\nthe protest of the city. They paid all the costs, including the money\r\nadvanced by the city for printing the record. To their defeat all along\r\nthe line they did not want to add a formal decision against them from\r\nthe Supreme Court, which was inevitable. And they ran away to fight\r\nanother day.\r\n\r\nAnother purpose of these suits was confessed only a few weeks after\r\nthis circular was issued. The existence of the suits was used to try to\r\nfrighten the city's natural-gas trustees into accepting a \"compromise.\"\r\nThe compromise was that they should abandon the enterprise, sell out\r\npipes and lands for a fraction of their worth, get their gas from the\r\nprivate company at higher rates, and put the city in its power for\r\nall time to come. \"It will be three or four years before your case is\r\nthrough the Supreme Court,\" its representative told the natural-gas\r\ntrustees, in urging them to accept. \"You can't sell your bonds,\" he\r\ncontinued; \"you have no money.\" The \"compromise\" was refused, but the\r\ncity's pipe line had been delayed so long that the profits of the\r\ncompany for another twelvemonth were secure.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration against the bonds in the United States Circuit Court\r\nhad been followed by similar suits in the State courts. Here again the\r\ncity was successful. It was upheld on every controverted ground--in\r\nthe enabling act, in the vote of the people, in the appointment of the\r\ntrustees by the governor, and in the issue of the city bonds. Appeal\r\nwas taken here, as in the United States courts, and, as there, for\r\ndelay, not for decision. To checkmate further use of this lawsuit to\r\nsmother the law and cripple the city, the friends of the pipe line\r\nbegan a suit against the authorities to force an immediate decision\r\nfrom the Ohio Supreme Court as to the legality of the bonds. It was\r\ncertainly, as was said in the press, \"a curious state of things when\r\nthe defendant is compelled to bring suit against himself because the\r\nplaintiff refuses to allow trial in his own case.\"\r\n\r\nThese litigations, the circulars, the press, were only part of the\r\ncampaign. One of the committees of the Common Council was brought\r\nunder control, and induced to throw technical difficulties in the way\r\nof the sale of the bonds, which caused months of delay.[531] Effort\r\nwas made to get the Governor to appoint natural-gas trustees hostile\r\nto the city, but failed. It was attempted, also without success, to\r\nget the Legislature to prevent the sale of the bonds at private sale.\r\nDuring all this controversy the city was most fortunate in receiving\r\nthe needful authority from the State Legislature. This was due mainly\r\nto a faithful and able representative of Toledo in that body, the Hon.\r\nC.P. Griffin. He was offered every promise of political preferment\r\nand other allurements to betray his constituents, but he always\r\nremained faithful. Without his support the efforts of the city would\r\nhave failed. His services amid great temptations deserve the grateful\r\nremembrance of the public.\r\n\r\nSome of the devices of \"private enterprise\" were childish enough.\r\n\"A Business Men's Protest\" was published, which proved under the\r\nmicroscope to have been largely signed by men whose names could not be\r\nfound in the directory. A similarly formidable-looking remonstrance\r\nagainst the pipe-line bill was sent to the Legislature. It had 1426\r\nnames; of these 464 could not be found in the directory, and over 300\r\nof the 962 remaining names signed the petition for the city's bill.\r\nMany of them avowed that when they had signed the \"Remonstrance\" it\r\nhad a heading in favor of the pipe line, which must have been changed\r\nafterwards. As part of the tactics of misinformation, a report was\r\npublished--in January, 1890--claiming to give the business of both the\r\nprivate companies; but the members of the Council Committee on Gas,\r\nwhen afterwards examining the books for the gas company, found that\r\nit gave the receipts of only one company. A paper was prepared by a\r\ncitizens' meeting for circulation among the manufacturers to ascertain\r\nhow much they would contribute towards the city pipe line; but when\r\nreported back to the meeting it had become, in some mysterious way, a\r\npaper asking the manufacturers how much they would advance to quite a\r\ndifferent scheme, the effect of which would be to sell out the city\r\npipe line or convert it into a manufacturers' line.\r\n\r\nThese were the infantile methods of men who could not see the\r\nludicrousness of the position they put themselves in by such efforts to\r\nkeep a business which they were constantly declaring to be hazardous\r\nand unprofitable.\r\n\r\nDetectives appear in almost every scene of our story, and are as common\r\nin its plot as in any extravagant melodrama of the Bowery thirty years\r\nago. To counteract the anonymous circulars the City Council sent a\r\ncommittee headed by Mayor Hamilton--the \"War Mayor,\" one of the ablest\r\nlawyers of the city, upright and loyal at all times to Toledo--to visit\r\nthe Eastern money-markets. The committee, in their official report,\r\nstate that they were assured by responsible dealers in municipal\r\nsecurities in New York and Boston that they would bid for the entire\r\namount to be sold. \"We regret, however, to have to report that the\r\npowerful and influential parties who have on all occasions and in every\r\nway sought to obstruct and defeat the enterprise for which the proceeds\r\nof these bonds were to be used, in some way succeeded in inducing those\r\nwho intended to purchase to withhold their bids--in fact, no matter\r\nhow guarded our movements, we believe that every person or firm with\r\nwhom we had interviews was reported to the agents of the Standard\r\nOil Company, for in every instance where from our interviews we had\r\nencouragement that the bonds would be bid for, within a short time more\r\nor less influential agents of opponents interviewed these parties and\r\nsucceeded in changing their minds.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a picture of \"high finance,\" of the \"beneficent inter-play of the\r\nforces of supply and demand,\" of the \"marvellous perfection\" with which\r\ncapital moves under \"natural laws\" to carry its fertilizing influences\r\nwhere they are most needed! The officials of this free city compelled\r\nto sneak around in the open money-market under cover with \"guarded\r\nmovements,\" seeking buyers for its bonds as if they were stolen goods!\r\nAbout them a cloud of spies and detectives reporting every movement as\r\nif it were a crime to the little handful of trust millionaires in their\r\ngrand building on Broadway! \"They have entered the ---- Bank!\" \"They\r\nhave just left ----'s office!\" After each report the leash is slipped\r\nof a waiting sleuth, who flies away to run down the quarry.\r\n\r\nThe gas trustees made public a letter and telegram they received from a\r\nprominent New York bank:\r\n\r\n \"NEW YORK, November 27, 1889.\r\n\r\n \"DEAR SIR,--A gentleman named\" (naming a man who signs the\r\n certificates of the Standard Oil Trust as treasurer),[532] \"introduced\r\n by the card of Mr. ----\" (one of the richest men in New York not\r\n otherwise known as connected with the trust), \"called on us to-day and\r\n stated that understanding that our firm was on the point of bidding\r\n on the Toledo bonds, etc., he would caution against the purchase, as\r\n they were not legal. Mr. ---- represented himself as coming from ----\"\r\n (one of the companies of the oil combination), \"and referred us to\r\n their lawyer for further information. Now as this may hurt the sale\r\n of the bonds we want to be cautious, and on Friday will make further\r\n inquiries, and will wire you accordingly. We may not care to hand in\r\n our bids on this account.\"\r\n\r\nThe telegram sent on Friday is as follows:\r\n\r\n \"NEW YORK, November 30th.\r\n\r\n \"Fearing sale of bonds has been injured, will not bid at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"That tells the story,\" said one of the trustees, \"in a nut-shell.\"\r\n\r\nA local bank bid for $500,000 of the bonds, but did not sustain its\r\nbid. A reputable citizen, an ex-mayor, wrote for publication in one of\r\nthe leading journals that he had been informed by a well-known banker\r\nthere was reason to believe a banking firm which, in 1892, defaulted\r\non its bid for bonds, had been indemnified by the opposition for the\r\n$5000 it thereby forfeited to the city, and for the profits it would\r\nhave made from the sale of the bonds. With the city line crippled the\r\ngas company would pocket the profits on the sale of a million dollars'\r\nworth of gas a year. Five thousand dollars, or several times that, was\r\na small insurance to pay for such a gain.\r\n\r\nThis was the game of hide-and-seek played in Wall Street by detectives\r\nand financial stilettos against \"simple greens,\" who thought supply and\r\ndemand still rule values. This was the reality which the officials of\r\nToledo found behind the outward aspect of its magnificent buildings,\r\nthe benevolent millionaires who look out through their plate-glass, the\r\ngrandiloquent generalizations of professors about \"the money-market.\"\r\n\r\nThe city was brought to the humiliation of seeing its officials meet\r\nin public session at an appointed hour to open bids it had invited\r\nfrom all the money centres for its bonds, only to have the news\r\nflashed all over the country that not a bid from abroad had been\r\nmade. This opposition cost the city in one way and another not less\r\nthan $1,000,000, according to the estimate of the city's natural-gas\r\ntrustees. The feeling of the people was expressed in the following\r\nlanguage in a circular sent out with the pamphlet report of the\r\ncommittee appointed in mass-meeting to make a statement of Toledo's\r\ncase to the public:\r\n\r\n\"We have seen the modern aggregation of corporations--trusts--suppress\r\nother corporations in the same line of business. But this Toledo\r\ncontest is believed to be the first instance where private\r\ncorporations--creatures of the State--have assumed to exercise\r\nmonarchical powers over a portion of the State--one of its leading\r\nmunicipalities; to dictate the policy of its people; to seek to\r\ncontrol the legislation as to the laws that should be enacted for such\r\nportion of the State; to bribe and intimidate the votes of such city\r\nat the polls; to attempt to subsidize the press by the most liberal\r\nexpenditure of money; to at last purchase, out and out, a heretofore\r\nleading paper of the city, place its own managers and attorneys as\r\ndirectors, import one of its long-trained men as editor, and turn\r\nthis paper into an engine of attack upon the city, an attack upon\r\nthe city's honor and credit, characterized by the most unscrupulous\r\nmisrepresentation and a perfect abandonment of all the amenities of\r\ncivilized warfare.\"\r\n\r\nThe Toledo public felt no doubt as to who were attacking it under\r\nthe convenient anonymity of the two gas corporations. At a public\r\nconference, January 16, 1889, between the presidents of the private\r\nnatural-gas companies and the people assembled in mass-meeting, the\r\nrepresentative of the former said the only condition on which the\r\nmembers of the oil trust had been induced to interest themselves in\r\nnatural-gas in Northwestern Ohio was that of absolute and unqualified\r\ncontrol of the entire business through a majority of the stock of all\r\nthe gas companies to be organized.\r\n\r\n\"The trust is interested in companies engaged in supplying natural\r\ngas?\" the president of the oil trust was asked by the New York\r\nLegislature about this time.\r\n\r\n\"To a limited extent, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they a majority interest in any of these companies?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they have.\"[533]\r\n\r\nThis was identically the arrangement by which the nine trustees owned\r\nas their private property the control of the oil business. At several\r\nlater conferences with the city's trustees and the Common Council\r\nthe gas companies were represented by one of the principal members\r\nof the oil combination, the ingenious gentleman who had managed the\r\nnegotiations with the railroads by which, under the _alias_ of the\r\nAmerican Transfer Company, the trust claimed and got a rebate of 20\r\nto 35 cents a barrel,[534] not only on all oil it shipped, but on all\r\nshipped by its competitors. He was also its representative in the\r\nsimilar arrangement by which the Cleveland and Marietta Railroad\r\nagreed to carry its oil for 10 cents a barrel, to charge Rice 35 cents,\r\nand to pay it 25 out of every 35 cents Rice paid.[535] He had acted in\r\nthe same interest throughout the gas field as well as in oil, and his\r\npathway could be traced through one independent company after another,\r\nwhose wrecks, like those in oil, are milestones.\r\n\r\nJuly 27, 1889, in an item originating in New York, in the _Tribune_, a\r\nfriendly paper, and given an extensive circulation by news despatches\r\nsent to the leading papers in other cities, it was said that the\r\nrepresentatives of the oil trust \"in this city say emphatically\r\nthat they will attack in the courts the right of the city to issue\r\nthem\"--the bonds.\r\n\r\nAt the great meeting of the citizens, October 19, 1889, to organize\r\na popular subscription to take the bonds killed in the money-market,\r\nthe resolutions named the oil combination as the power responsible for\r\nthe attacks on the city, and appealed to the people to observe that\r\nit, \"no longer content with destroying individuals and associations\r\nwhich stand in the way of its moneyed interests, now rises to grapple\r\nwith and destroy the rights of cities and states; we therefore ask all\r\nliberty-loving men to make common cause with us in the defence of the\r\ncommunity against the aggression of colossal power.\"\r\n\r\nThe aldermen and the Common Council of Toledo unanimously adopted\r\nresolutions, September 15, 1890, requesting the State and Federal\r\ncourts to give decisions as promptly as possible in the suits pending\r\nagainst the validity of the natural-gas bonds. These bodies in their\r\nofficial utterance declared that the oil combination, \"through its\r\nofficers and agents in the city of Toledo and at many other points in\r\nthe United States, has circulated false and malicious statements about\r\nthe bonds of the city of Toledo issued for natural-gas purposes.\" The\r\nnatural-gas trustees of the city say in their report for 1890: \"These\r\ninjunctions and circulars, although fathered in the first instance\r\nby non-resident taxpayers, and in the second by irresponsible or\r\nanonymous parties, were traced directly to the oil trust, a trust\r\nhaving a large number of corporations within its control, among which\r\nis the North-western Ohio Natural Gas Company, and to whom the city\r\nof Toledo may reasonably attribute a loss of more than a million of\r\ndollars already. What further financial embarrassment it may suffer\r\nin the future cannot be measured by the depravity and moral turpitude\r\nwhich its seeds have sown in our midst.\"[536]\r\n\r\nWhen the warfare against Toledo became a scandal ringing throughout\r\nthe country and beyond, the organ of the trust in Toledo attempted to\r\nmake it appear that the oil trust was not the party in interest. But\r\nthere was open confession on the record. Its connection and its control\r\nwere admitted by two representatives in conference with a committee\r\nappointed by the mayor at their request to discuss the situation.[537]\r\nThey described the circumstances under which the members of the oil\r\ntrust had gone into the project of the Toledo line and the project\r\nof the natural-gas business. One of the two stated that he came into\r\nit as its \"more direct representative.\" The pipe line of the private\r\ngas company was built, he went on to say, by one of the principal\r\ncorporations in the oil trust. At the same interview it was admitted\r\nthat the oil trust owned 60 per cent. of the natural-gas company's\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThe people of Toledo did not surrender to this success of their enemies\r\nin the money-market. The bonds which calumny and espionage prevented\r\nthem from selling at wholesale to the great capitalists of New York and\r\nBoston they took themselves at retail. The Legislature having given\r\nauthority for such sales, a committee of one hundred had been appointed\r\nby the citizens' meeting, October 19, 1889, to canvass all the wards of\r\nthe city for subscriptions to the gas bonds. \"Gas Bond Pledges\" were\r\ncirculated, to which people subscribed according to their ability, in\r\namounts ranging from $2 to $5000. The employés at the Wabash Railway's\r\ncar shops sent in a list signed by fifty names for a total of $1102, an\r\naverage of $22 each. The labor of two hundred men for a week without\r\npay was offered the gas trustees as an earnest of the good-will of the\r\npeople. Piece by piece the city's pipe line was pushed through. At a\r\ncritical moment a shrewd and patriotic contractor saved the enterprise\r\nby building a large part of the line, and taking for his pay the bonds\r\nthe banks would not take. In June, 1890, the public were gratified by\r\nthe announcement that their trustees had secured the means \"for the\r\nconstruction of three miles more,\" making eight miles in all, or nearly\r\none-fourth the entire line. In August a contract was made for five\r\nmiles more, and so the work went on, step after step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nA SUNDAY IN JUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the anxious discussion by the citizens of Toledo as\r\nto the character of the power which ruled them both by night and by\r\nday, the same question arose in the metropolitan religious press, but\r\nin its broader ethical aspects. After the petition of Toledo to be\r\nallowed to take the control of its light, heat, and power into its own\r\nhands had been laid before the Legislature, the _National Baptist_\r\nof Philadelphia, in an article on the trusts, criticised them as the\r\nprophet Nathan would have done. It gave to that in oil, \"of course,\r\nthe bad pre-eminence in all this matter.\" \"This corporation has, by\r\nability, by boldness, by utter unscrupulousness, by the use of vast\r\ncapital, managed to control every producer, every carrier, to say\r\nnothing of the legislatures and courts.\" The _Examiner_, the leading\r\nreligious weekly of the Baptist denomination in New York, rose against\r\nthis. \"We can readily understand how there should be differences of\r\nopinion in the matter of these trusts, and their influence is a proper\r\nsubject of discussion; but to make it the occasion of so unjust and\r\nintemperate an attack on Christian men of the highest excellence of\r\ncharacter is something that was not expected from a paper bearing\r\nsuch a name. The four most prominent men in the oil trust are eminent\r\nBaptists, who honor their religious obligations, and contribute without\r\nstint to the noblest Christian and philanthropic objects.... All\r\nof them illustrate in their daily lives their reverence for living\r\nChristianity.\"\r\n\r\nThe _National Baptist_ did not submit to this attempt to cite men's\r\ncreeds to prevent judgment on their deeds. It quoted the reply Macaulay\r\nmakes Milton give to the similar pleas urged for King Charles: \"For\r\nhis private virtues they are beside the question. If he oppress and\r\nextort all day, shall he be held blameless because he prayeth at night\r\nand morning?\" It held to its ground, and cited against the trust\r\nthe recorded evidence, but it declared it was \"a marked breach of\r\npropriety for the _Examiner_ to bring their private character into the\r\ndiscussion.\" The _National Baptist_, going on to speak in praise of a\r\nseries of lively cartoons in _Harper's Weekly_ on the Forty Thieves of\r\nthe Trusts and similar subjects, said, with some sadness: \"It will be\r\na sorry spectacle if the secular papers shall be ranged on the side of\r\njustice and the human race, while the defence of monopoly shall be left\r\nto the so-called representatives of the religious press.\"\r\n\r\nLater, March 20, 1890, the _Examiner_ returned again to its\r\ndiscussion of the religious performances of the chiefs of the oil\r\ntrust as a matter of public importance. Of one of them it said: \"The\r\nprayer-meetings of the Fifth Avenue Church are on Wednesday evening,\r\nand no business man in the church is less likely to be absent from one\r\nof them than he. His wife and children, when they are in the city, come\r\nwith him, and it is by no means an unusual thing for the whole family\r\nto take part, each of them occupying one or two minutes of time. He and\r\nthey are at church every Sunday when in the city, and no husband and\r\nwife keep up the good old Baptist habit more faithfully of exchanging a\r\nkind word with the brethren and sisters after the regular services are\r\nover. He dresses plainly, and so do his family, and every one of them\r\nhas a kind heart and a pleasant word for all. They are among the last\r\nto leave the church and the prayer-meeting. Now the question is, How\r\nis it, as things go, that a man possessing the great wealth imputed to\r\nhim should have so warm a fraternity of feeling for the lowly in their\r\ntemporal conditions? And is there not an example here that might well\r\nbe imitated in all the churches of our Lord?\"\r\n\r\nIn an address on Corporations the reverend secretary of the Church\r\nEdifice Department of the Home Missionary Department of the Baptist\r\nChurch followed the example of the leading Church journal. \"The oil\r\ntrust was,\" he said, \"begun and carried on by Christian men.[538] They\r\nwere Baptists, and, so far as the speaker knew, both the objects and\r\nthe methods of the oil trust were praiseworthy.\" A clergyman of another\r\ndenomination once called upon one of the great men of the trust to seek\r\na subscription.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the rich man, \"I am not of your Church.\"\r\n\r\n\"That does not matter,\" said the minister, \"your money is orthodox.\"\r\n\r\nThe secular press followed the example of the religious press in\r\ntreating their public faithfulness to Church ceremonies as news of the\r\nday, and part of the record of their social functions. The New York\r\ncorrespondent of the Philadelphia _Daily Record_ wrote for the people\r\nof Philadelphia: \"It is not often that a millionaire stands up to lead\r\nin prayer, but I heard the president of the oil combination make an\r\nexcellent prayer the other evening. He is said to be worth $25,000,000,\r\nbut he neither drinks nor uses tobacco, and he is a deacon in Dr.\r\nArmitage's church. He likes a fast horse, and has eleven horses in his\r\nstable here. Few men, however, lead plainer lives than he, and few put\r\non less style. He gives liberally to unsectarian charities, but, he\r\nsays, 'when it comes to Church work I always give to the Baptists--my\r\nown denomination--and to no other Church.'\" A New York daily described\r\nthe same trustee \"as one of the few millionaires who devote much of\r\ntheir time to the improvement of the condition of others. When not\r\ncalled away by social or business engagements, you are pretty sure\r\nto find him at home evenings. Here, in his costly and well-equipped\r\nlibrary, he receives his visitors, many of whom represent the various\r\nbenevolent and religious undertakings in which he is interested. He\r\nhas for years been a hearty supporter, financially and personally, of\r\nforeign-missionary work, and no layman, perhaps, is so well informed\r\nconcerning the details of it. He has a personal acquaintance with\r\nmany of the leading missionaries of the world, and his residence is\r\nfrequently the scene of a gathering of these workers among the heathen.\r\nHe is now devoting considerable attention to home-missionary work,\r\na field which, he is convinced, presents splendid opportunities for\r\nChristian endeavor.\"\r\n\r\nMany descriptions have been given by the press, metropolitan and\r\ninterior, of the success with which one of the trustees built up the\r\nlargest Sunday-school in his city at the same time that he was building\r\nup the monopoly--leading the children of his competitors and customers\r\nto salvation with his left hand, while with his right he led their\r\nfathers in the opposite direction financially. The church where these\r\nmen appear has had columns of admiring description in the leading\r\ndaily papers of New York and other cities. \"There are few wealthier\r\ncongregations than this one,\" says a reporter of the New York _World_,\r\nthough he adds, \"the wealth is elsewhere more evenly divided.\" The\r\ntrustee of the light of the world \"is the magnate of the church, the\r\ncentre around which all lesser millionaire lights revolve. Everybody\r\nstops to speak and shake hands with him. Everybody smiles upon him,\r\nthis modest man of nearly $200,000,000.\" \"It is amusing,\" says the\r\nBrooklyn _Eagle_, \"to note the manner in which his neighbors watch him\r\nduring the service. Quite a number of people loiter near the door to\r\nsee him as he walks out of church.\" \"They are worth a bit of careful\r\nstudy,\" says another paper of the trustees, \"and no place is quite so\r\nconvenient as when they are at church. Their interest in religion is\r\nas sincere as their belief in oil. From the moment they enter church\r\nuntil they leave they are examples that Christians of high and low\r\ndegree might follow with profit.\" \"They have made the most of both\r\nworlds,\" writes another journalist. The oil trust was criticised\r\nby the Rev. Washington Gladden at Chautauqua, in 1889. One of its\r\nprominent officials, as reported in a friendly journal, defended it as\r\n\"a sound Christian institution; and all these communistic attacks are\r\ndue entirely to the jealousy of those who cannot stand other people's\r\nprosperity.\"[539]\r\n\r\n\"In Anniversary week\" in Boston, in May, 1889, at the meeting of the\r\nAmerican Baptist Education Society, the secretary said he had an\r\nannouncement to make. \"It had been whispered about,\" says the New\r\nYork _Examiner_ of May 23, 1889, from whose friendly account we are\r\nquoting, \"that something important was to occur at this meeting, and a\r\nbreathless silence awaited the announcement. Holding up a letter, the\r\nsecretary said that he had here a pledge from a princely giver to our\r\neducational causes, naming him (here he was interrupted by a tremendous\r\ncheer), of $600,000 for the proposed Chicago college.... This statement\r\nwas followed by a perfect bedlam of applause, shouts, and waving of\r\nhandkerchiefs. One brother on the platform was so excited that he flung\r\nhis hat up into the air, and lost it among the audience.\" Eloquent\r\nspeeches at once overflowed the lips of the leading men of the meeting,\r\nwhich was a delegate assembly. They sprang to their feet, one after\r\nthe other, and mutually surpassed each other in praising God and the\r\ngiver of this gift, which was equal to his income for a fortnight. \"I\r\nscarcely dare trust myself to speak,\" said a doctor of divinity. \"The\r\ncoming to the front of such a princely giver--the man to lead.... It\r\nis the Lord's doing.... As an American, a Baptist, and a Christian I\r\nrejoice in this consummation. God has kept Chicago for us; I wonder at\r\nhis patience.\" Another reverend doctor said: \"The Lord hath done great\r\nthings for us.... The man who has given this money is a godly man, who\r\ndoes God's will as far as he can find out what God's will is.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience rose spontaneously and sang the Doxology. On motion the\r\nfollowing telegram was sent, signed by the president of the society:\r\n\r\n \"BOSTON, May 18, 1889.\r\n\r\n \"The Baptist denomination, assembled at the first anniversary of the\r\n Education Society, have received with unparalleled enthusiasm and\r\n gratitude the announcement of your princely gift, and pledge their\r\n heartiest co-operation in the accomplishment of this magnificent\r\n enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nThe name signed to this telegram happened to be the same as that of\r\nthe divine with whom, when president of Brown University in 1841, one\r\nof the most devoted of the laborers for the freedom of the negro had a\r\ndiscussion which is perhaps the most pungent in the literature of the\r\nantislavery movement.\r\n\r\nOn August 30, 1841, Henry C. Wright wrote to Edmund Quincy: \"I once met\r\nthe president of Brown University, in the presence of several friends,\r\nto converse on the subject of slavery. The conversation turned on the\r\nquestion: Can a slaveholder be a Christian? To bring it to a point,\r\naddressing myself to the doctor, I asked him, 'Can a man be a Christian\r\nand claim a right to sunder husbands and wives, parents and children,\r\nto compel men to work without wages, to forbid them to read the Bible,\r\nand buy and sell them, and who habitually does these things?' 'Yes,'\r\nanswered the reverend doctor and president, 'provided he has the\r\nspirit of Christ.' 'Is it possible for a man to be governed by the\r\nspirit of Christ and claim a right to commit these atrocious deeds,\r\nand habitually commit them?' After some turning he answered, 'Yes, I\r\nbelieve he can.' 'Is there, then, one crime in all the catalogue of\r\ncrimes which of itself would be evidence to you that a man had not the\r\nspirit of Christ?' I asked. 'Yes, thousands,' said the doctor. 'What?'\r\nI asked. 'Stealing,' said he. 'Stealing what, a sheep or a _man_?'\r\nI asked. The doctor took his hat and left the room, and appeared no\r\nmore.\"[540]\r\n\r\nThe Sunday following a special service was held in the churches\r\nthroughout the country in behalf of further help in \"the new\r\neducational crisis.\" Many eulogistic sermons were preached that day\r\nby the leading clergymen of the denomination. \"And so,\" one of them\r\nis reported to have said, \"when a crisis came God had a man ready to\r\nmeet it.... An institution was bound to come, and unless a God-fearing\r\nman established it it was likely to be materialistic, agnostic.... In\r\nthis emergency, and in God's providence, society raised up a man with\r\na colossal fortune, and a heart as large as his fortune.\" \"God,\" said\r\nthe Chicago _Standard_, a religious weekly, \"has guided us and provided\r\nus a leader and a giver, and so brought us out into a large place.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of the trustees has poured into a Southern State hundreds\r\nof thousands of dollars for churches of various denominations, and\r\nmillions for hotels of a more than Oriental magnificence. \"There is\r\nno philanthropist,\" says an editor of that State, commenting on these\r\nexpenditures, \"who renders the world greater service than the man of\r\nenterprise.\" But \"Western Pennsylvania,\" said the Pittsburg _Post_,\r\n\"looks more with awe than pride at the liberal diffusion of its wealth\r\nin Florida improvements and Baptist universities.\" A daily paper of\r\nRichmond, Virginia, in an editorial commenting on a report that the\r\nhostlery glories of St. Augustine were to be repeated in Richmond,\r\nsaid: \"We have naught to remark on the tyrant monopoly if some of\r\nits profits are to come in such a direction. We could forgive much\r\nthat monopoly visits on the down-trodden, horny-handed son of toil\r\nif it would come with open pockets proclaiming the era of luxuriant\r\naccommodations for all those other millionaires whose money we want to\r\nsee invested in Richmond.\"\r\n\r\nThe next year after the Boston meeting the Church celebrated its\r\n\"Anniversary week\" in the city which was to be the seat of the new\r\ncollege. And the anniversary closed with a jubilee meeting, which\r\nfilled the largest assembly room in America. \"All the church-going\r\npeople of Chicago must have attended,\" one of the daily papers said. It\r\nwas addressed by the principal clergymen of the denomination from all\r\nparts of the country. Again, as at Boston, the centre of interest was\r\nthe gift of a fortnight's income to the university. A telegram making\r\nthe gift conclusive, since the conditions on which it was promised had\r\nbeen complied with, was read. Cheer after cheer rose from the assembly,\r\nand oratory and music expressed the emotion of the audience. The divine\r\nwho made the closing speech declared that he needed ice on his head on\r\naccount of the joyful excitement of the occasion. The cheers and the\r\nhand-clapping closed again, as at Boston, with the spirited singing\r\nof the Doxology. Not only in the religious press of all denominations,\r\nbut in the worldly press, the topic was the best of \"copy.\" The great\r\ndailies gave columns, and even pages, to the incident, and to the\r\nsubsequent gift from the same source of larger sums. \"Conspicuously\r\nprovidential,\" \"princely,\" \"grand,\" \"munificent contribution,\"\r\n\"man of God,\" were the phrases of praise. A writer in the New York\r\n_Independent_ said: \"Your correspondent speaks from opportunities of\r\npersonal observation in saying that pecuniary benefaction to a public\r\ncause seldom if ever, in his belief, flowed from a purer Christian\r\nsource.\" The only recorded note of dissent came from a humbler source.\r\nUnder the text, \"I hate robbery as a burnt-offering,\" a weekly business\r\njournal said: \"The endowment of an educational institution where the\r\nstudies shall be limited to a single course, and that a primary course\r\nin commercial integrity, would be a still more advantageous outlet for\r\nsuperabundant capital. Such an institution would fill a crying want.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the last Thursday in May, 1890, when this great representative\r\nconvention of the Church from all parts of the United States celebrated\r\nthe acceptance of this endowment. Even while the roll of the Doxology\r\nwas still rising to the roof of the auditorium the plans were preparing\r\nfor a performance at Fostoria the next Sunday, three days later, which\r\nhad a profound effect upon Toledo, though just the opposite of what was\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nFostoria, Ohio, is the home of the president of the principal\r\nnatural-gas company in Ohio controlled by the oil trust and leader\r\nin the vendetta against Toledo. A wealthy miller erected in Fostoria\r\nin 1886 a flouring-mill, with a capacity of 1000 barrels a day. One\r\nof the inducements was a contract made with this manufacturer by the\r\ngas company, by which it bound itself to supply him with natural-gas\r\nat a price which would be one-fifth what coal would cost him, and to\r\ncontinue to supply him as long as it supplied any one. The manufacturer\r\ncarried out his agreement by the expenditure of $150,000 for the\r\nerection of the mill, and by running it continually to its full\r\ncapacity. His bills for gas he paid promptly every month. Relying upon\r\nthe contract with the gas company, the mill was built for natural\r\ngas, and could use no other fuel. In February, 1890, the gas company,\r\ndissatisfied with the bargain it had made, demanded better terms. The\r\nmilling company refused. On a Sunday morning in June, \"when, if ever,\r\ncome perfect days,\" a gang of men appeared, led by an officer of the\r\ngas company, and dug up and tore out the pipes supplying the mill with\r\ngas.\r\n\r\nChurch bells of different denominations were scattering their sweet\r\njangle of invitations to the sanctuary as the tramp of these banded\r\nmen, issuing on their errand of force, mixed with the patter on the\r\nsidewalks of devout feet. Private grounds were unlawfully entered,\r\nproperty was destroyed, the peace broken, a day of love changed to one\r\nof hate, all the bonds of community cut asunder, and the people turned\r\nfrom the contemplation of divine goodness to gaze at shapes of greed\r\nand rage. Sunday is chosen for such deeds, since the help with which\r\nthe pagan law, gift of heathen Rome, would interpose, cannot be invoked\r\nby the victims on Sunday, and because on Sunday Christian people go\r\nto church, and leave their property undefended. The peace-officers\r\nwere summoned to arrest the invaders for violating the Sunday law, but\r\nbefore they could get on the ground the mischief was done. The pipes\r\nhad all been excavated, the connections wrenched off, and the trench\r\nnearly filled up. The milling company began suit for $100,000 damages\r\nagainst the gas company,[541] but a private settlement was made, and\r\nthe case has never been pressed to trial. The laborers who did the work\r\nof the Captains of Industry in this matter were tried and convicted at\r\nthe County Court in July, but by no process did the law, which is \"no\r\nrespecter of persons,\" reach out towards the principals.\r\n\r\nThis Fostoria incident occurred during the heat of the Toledo\r\ncontest--June, 1890--while the city was pushing the sale of bonds\r\nfor its emancipating pipe line by popular subscription and in odd\r\nlots. Notice had been already served on the people of Toledo at public\r\nconference, that despite contracts, charters, franchises, the private\r\ncompanies would not take any less price from Toledo than they demanded.\r\nIn pursuance of this, after the council had fixed the price in\r\naccordance with its admitted right, a circular was sent out containing\r\nthis significant threat: \"If it\"--the legally declared price--\"is\r\napproved by our customers we will know what course to pursue.\"\r\n\r\nEven before the occurrence at Fostoria it had been definitely suggested\r\nto the people of Toledo that in case the council failed to accept\r\nthe demand as to rates in making the new ordinance (July, 1890) the\r\npipes would be so far removed as to cut off the supply on some Sunday\r\nwhen no legal help could be invoked. The possibility of this Sunday\r\ncut-off of the fuel supply of 15,000 consumers became a living topic of\r\ndiscussion, public and private, and was considered in all its bearings\r\nby the Toledo press. Calculations were made and published of the\r\nnumber of men it would require to take up the hundred miles or so of\r\npipe in the streets of Toledo between dark and dark some holy Sabbath\r\nday. It was confessed, hopelessly, that they would be more than the\r\npolice could handle. \"Of course,\" as was said in the Toledo _Blade_ by\r\na leading citizen, \"such enterprise would involve a very remarkable\r\ndegree of both lawlessness and desperation on the part of the managers.\r\nIt would be a mode of withdrawal from trade quite unknown among sound\r\nbusiness men. But then their processes have been peculiar from the\r\nstart.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nothing less than startling to Toledo, almost before the print\r\non the types of these words was dry, to hear the news from Fostoria of\r\nthe Sunday raid there. There were those who declared that the Sunday\r\nviolence at Fostoria was deliberately done as a warning to Toledo. If\r\nit were a warning to them not to insist on the legal and equitable and\r\ncontract right of their Common Council to fix the rates of gas, it\r\nwas a failure. The council went forward and did its duty. If it were\r\na warning to the people to redouble their labors to free themselves\r\nforever from the possibility of such thraldom as that in which Fostoria\r\nand other cities were enchained, it was a success. The people heard and\r\nheeded, and in ten months thereafter gas began to flow into the city\r\nthrough its own pipes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTOLEDO VICTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable to see the revival of the passion of freedom of 1776\r\nand 1861 in the editorials, speeches, resolutions of public meetings,\r\nand the talk of the common people in Toledo as in Columbus. The example\r\nof \"the heroic liberty-loving people of Boston\" was held up in every\r\naspect to fire the heart of Toledo not to be frightened into subjection\r\nto the foreign power that threatened them. To resist \"the domination\r\nof an economic monarchy\" was the appeal made in posters with which the\r\ntown was placarded.\r\n\r\n\"During all the time George III.'s soldiers were quartered in Boston\r\nthat monarch did not spend as much money to bring the city to terms as\r\nhas been spent in this effort to subjugate the city of Toledo,\" said\r\nAlderman Macomber.\r\n\r\n\"A people like those of Toledo,\" said one of them in the press, \"when\r\nonce united and determined as they now are, cannot be subjugated by any\r\ncombination of mercenaries yet known.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is evident,\" the Toledo _Sunday Gazette_ said, \"that the people\r\nof Toledo have come to a full realization of the truth that the money\r\nsaved by the independent pipe line, though great, is a matter of little\r\nimportance compared with the social and political issues involved. It\r\nwould be a thousand times better,\" it continued, \"to utterly bankrupt\r\nthe city than permit the oil combination to win. The fight was not for\r\nthe present alone, but it was for the present and future, and for all\r\ntime to come. It was not for the people of Toledo alone, but it was for\r\nthe whole Union, though God had chosen the people of Toledo for the\r\nstruggle.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati _Commercial-Gazette_ said, in its editorial columns:\r\n\"In itself the Toledo enterprise is not a big one, but it will prove\r\nan object-lesson for the whole country. It will show the open door\r\nthrough which people may pass from under the yoke of a most gigantic,\r\nunscrupulous, and odious monopoly. And it will be surprising if this\r\ndoes not extend beyond gas and ultimately cover oil. We are only on the\r\nverge of a revolution that is as sure to come as that which followed\r\nthe throwing overboard of a lot of tea in Boston Harbor. Neither the\r\npower nor the vulgarity of capital can long rule the people.\"\r\n\r\nNumerous letters of sympathy, congratulation, and indignation\r\nwere received by the Toledo committee appointed by the citizens'\r\nmass-meeting to make a statement of their case to the people of the\r\nUnited States. There were letters from chairs of political economy in\r\nthe universities, from scholars and students in history and politics,\r\nand from men in affairs and finance.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the line to the city was not the completion of the\r\nenterprise. Mains had still to be laid in the streets, and house\r\nconnections made. At every step, now as before, unrelenting opposition\r\ndid all that could be conceived of--in the courts, the Legislature, the\r\ncity government, the money-market--to block municipal self-help. Great\r\nnumbers of the citizens desired to change from the private companies\r\nto the city. Over 7500 consumers were at one time, in 1891, calling\r\nupon the city to supply them.[542] The litigation which was kept up,\r\nand the defeat of the attempt of the city to sell its natural-gas bonds\r\nin the open market, had exhausted the funds at the disposal of the\r\ncity trustees. But they showed a readiness of resource equal, with the\r\nhelp of the people, to all these emergencies, and proving that public\r\nenterprise can more than hold its own in the competition with private\r\nenterprise. Contractors were got to pipe the streets by sections, and\r\ntake for pay the pledge of the income earned by the pipes so laid. In\r\nother cases people wanting the gas were willing to advance a part of\r\nthe cost. The same contractor who had faith enough in the city to build\r\nthe main line from the gas-fields and take the bonds while they were\r\nunder fire volunteered in the same way to build the submerged lines\r\nacross the Maumee River, and ten miles of mains within the city. This\r\nwas done at a moment when otherwise the enterprise must have come to a\r\nstop, and the name of this patriotic contractor is given to the public\r\nby the trustees in their annual report with words of gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe amount of bonds originally authorized was $750,000. The trustees,\r\nin consequence of the delays and enhanced cost caused by lawsuits and\r\nother tactics of opposition, had to incur a floating debt of $300,000.\r\nThe council by ordinance directed the issue of bonds by the city to\r\nthe amount of $120,000 to pay off part of this floating debt. The\r\nState Circuit Court refused to sustain this action of the council,\r\nbut pointed out that all the city lacked was the authorization of the\r\nLegislature. This was the only decision against the city in all the\r\nlitigations, and in this the State Court was afterwards overruled by\r\nthe United States Circuit Court. A bill was accordingly introduced,\r\ngiving the city the right to issue $300,000 in bonds for the floating\r\ndebt, and $100,000 for the extension of the gas plant: wells, pipes,\r\npumps--whatever was needed. A strong lobby immediately appeared in the\r\nState Capitol to defeat the bill. As part of its ammunition a pamphlet\r\nwas circulated among the legislators, giving \"Facts and Reasons\" why\r\nthe Legislature should not authorize the new issue of bonds. This\r\npamphlet illustrates the easy virtue with which some lawyers dispose\r\nof themselves to those who have the money to pay them. Two of its\r\nstrongest points were that the contracts for which the floating debt\r\nhad been incurred were let without proper competition, and that the\r\ntrustees had no power to make the contracts. This pamphlet was signed\r\nby two lawyers, one of whom, before these contracts were let, had\r\ngiven the trustees his written opinion supporting such contracts\r\nunqualifiedly. The representatives of the people were able to exhibit\r\nto the Legislature his written opinion stating that the trustees had\r\nthe power to make the contracts, and had let them in compliance with\r\nthe requirements of the statute as to bids. The pamphlet declared that\r\nthe court, in granting the injunction against the issue of the $120,000\r\nof bonds by the Common Council, had declared the claims which were to\r\nbe paid by the proceeds of the bonds to be \"illegal and invalid.\" This\r\nwas untrue. The court had held only that the city had not the power to\r\nissue the bonds, and pointed out that the remedy was in new legislation\r\nby the State to remedy the want of power.\r\n\r\nPursuing the tactics of defamation of the city and its authorities\r\nwhich had been used throughout this contest, the pamphlet said: \"We\r\nare prepared to prove ... that the contractors put in their bids\r\nsubstantially as gambling transactions, at such excessive price\r\nthat they thought they could take the risk of the illegality of the\r\nnatural-gas proceedings, trusting that these illegal transactions would\r\nbe permitted to pass without question, or that subsequent legislation\r\nwould ratify these illegal acts; all, or nearly all, of the contracts\r\nwere taken at prices more than double the fair cash value for all the\r\nwork and material provided for; and all the work and materials, the\r\nclaims for which now aggregate about $350,000, could have been obtained\r\nin the open market, under valid laws, upon proper terms of payment,\r\nfor less than $250,000. We have the evidence within our control to\r\nestablish that the work under some of these contracts was actually\r\ndone for less than 40 per cent. of the amount named in the contract.\r\nIn addition to these facts, we can establish, if permitted to offer\r\nevidence, that the certificates issued by the natural-gas trustees\r\nwere, immediately after the conclusion of the contracts and before any\r\nlitigation was had upon them, hawked about the streets of Toledo at\r\nfrom 60 to 75 cents on the dollar; and that the great majority of these\r\ncertificates are now in the hands of speculators, who bought them at\r\nnot to exceed 65 per cent. of their face value.\"\r\n\r\nThe authors of these statements were at once challenged by the city's\r\ngas trustees to prove them. \"We assert,\" the gas trustees said, in\r\na formal challenge, \"that you cannot establish the truth of those\r\nstatements. We deny that the facts are as you state them to be, either\r\nin substance or in detail.\" This was signed by John E. Parsons, W.W.\r\nJones, Reynold Voit, J.W. Greene, gas trustees, and Clarence Brown\r\nand Thomas H. Tracy, ex-gas-trustees. The city's trustees proposed\r\nthat they and their accusers deposit $1000 on each side as a forfeit\r\nto abide the result of an inquiry by the three judges of the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas, or any other disinterested arbitrators. They placed at\r\nthe service of the accusers and the arbiters all the books, records,\r\nand employés of the city's gas department.\r\n\r\nThe challenge was not accepted, and the authors of these attacks made\r\nno attempt to prove them. The Legislature disregarded them, and granted\r\nthe city and the gas trustees all the additional power to issue bonds\r\nasked for. In a subsequent proceeding in the Federal courts--the issue\r\ninvolving the validity of these certificates--it was admitted, contrary\r\nto these allegations, that the prices were fair, and that the contracts\r\nwere entered into in good faith, and the court held the certificates\r\nvalid.\r\n\r\nThe most serious crisis in the contest was still to come. In 1892 the\r\ngas wells of the city began to do what the people of the city will\r\nnever do--surrender to the enemy. When the oil trust found, after years\r\nof opposition in the Legislature, the courts, and the gas-fields, that\r\nit had been helpless to prevent Toledo from getting ample tracts of\r\nexcellent gas territory, with some of the largest gas wells in the\r\nfield, and equal to the supply of the entire consumption, domestic and\r\nmanufacturing, it turned to other tactics.\r\n\r\nAll about this territory secured by Toledo and found so productive the\r\nprivate companies of the trust proceeded to buy or lease and to sink\r\nwells. The trust shut off all its own wells, except those adjacent to\r\nthe city territory, and for two years drew exclusively from the wells\r\nnearest those of the city. When the city's line was completed to the\r\nwells the volume of gas was found to be largely reduced. It had been\r\ndrawn off into the wells of the opposition. In the spring of 1892 the\r\nprivate companies resolved to put in pumps to strengthen the diminished\r\nnatural pressure, but to prevent the city from doing the same thing.\r\nThen, with their pumps alone at work, the pressure could be so much\r\nfurther reduced as to render the Toledo pipe line valueless. To this\r\nend all efforts were directed. The newspapers were kept full of matter\r\nshowing how impossible it was to pump gas, that all the money expended\r\nin pumps would be just so much wasted, and that the companies had\r\ncanvassed the matter fully, but abandoned the idea. Column after column\r\nof inspired interviews filled the papers, all admonishing the city of\r\nToledo not to commit such an act of folly as to put in gas pumps. Then\r\napplication was made to enjoin the sale of the bonds authorized by the\r\ncouncil and the Legislature for pumps. So month after month dragged\r\nalong. The bonds remained unsold, and the pumps unobtainable.\r\n\r\nThe injunction was refused both by the Court of Common Pleas and by\r\nthe Circuit Court. But there was a right of appeal to the Ohio Supreme\r\nCourt until the beginning of 1892. Boston bankers had subscribed for a\r\nlarge block of the bonds, but withdrew upon learning these facts. \"It\r\nis possible for the contestants,\" the lawyers advised them, \"to carry\r\nthe matter to the Supreme Court. This, we understand, they propose\r\nto do.\" The simple assertion of a purpose to continue the litigation\r\nwas enough to defeat the sale of the bonds. The payment of costs and\r\nlawyers' fees would be a very moderate price to pay for compelling the\r\ncity's gas plant to go past midwinter without the pumps indispensable\r\nfor its operation. One of the employés of the private pipe line,\r\naccording to an account in one of the Toledo papers, declared to a\r\nreporter that \"if we could not prevent the city from putting in a\r\n[pumping] plant any other way, we would blow it up with dynamite.\"[543]\r\n\r\nAny faithful employé familiar with the blowing up of derricks in the\r\nshut-down of 1887,[544] the explosion in the independent refinery at\r\nBuffalo,[545] and the \"chemical war\" waged by the whiskey trust against\r\nthe \"outsiders\" in Chicago[546] might almost be pardoned for thinking\r\nthis was \"only good, reasonable talk.\" The oil monopoly is evangelical\r\nat one end and explosive at the other, and it has made both ends meet.\r\n\r\nThe people of Toledo were thus prevented from getting the pumping\r\nfacilities ready during the summer of 1892 for the work of the winter.\r\nMeanwhile its rival had been secretly pushing pumps for itself to\r\ncompletion, in the hope that it alone would be ready when cold weather\r\ncame. This would mean a gain to it, at the city's expense, of hundreds\r\nof thousands of dollars. Late in August, 1892, the representatives of\r\nthe city found that two powerful duplex gas pumps had been shipped\r\nto the gas-field, and were being put in place by the very opponents\r\nwho had declared pumps impracticable. Public sentiment became aroused\r\nto the need for the immediate purchase of pumps to protect their\r\nwells. The city attempted to use its income from the sales of gas to\r\nbuy pumps. An injunction was applied for and granted. This emergency\r\nwas finally met by having the gas trustees hand over to the city\r\nauthorities the accumulated earnings they were forbidden by the court\r\nto spend themselves. The city thereupon turned around and invested\r\nthis money in the gas bonds. In this way the identical money the gas\r\ntrustees could not use while it remained in their hands was made\r\navailable to them by passing through the hands of the Sinking Fund\r\nTrustees, and coming back to them. Thus the natural-gas trustees were\r\nenabled to make a contract in September, 1892, for pumps to assist the\r\nflow of gas to the city.\r\n\r\nThe gas pumps are a patented device. The private companies, wanting\r\nall the profit of everything, had had their pumps made at their own\r\nfactory. The city made its contract directly with the owner of the\r\npatents. The result was that the city got its pumps in place in time\r\nto save the city pipe line, while its opponents were delayed by the\r\ninexperience of their own pump-makers. This was the most critical\r\nperiod in our history. Greed had again defeated itself. Had the\r\nopposition gone to the owner of the patents he would have been unable\r\nafterwards to take the city's contract and complete it in time, and the\r\neffort to make the city line valueless would have succeeded--for the\r\ntime being, at least. The bonds in question were afterwards held valid\r\nby the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nToledo knew it was building wisely, and every day brought new proof\r\nthat it had builded better than it knew. Its saving was great, but\r\nthat was the least of its gains. It escaped tyranny and extortion and\r\nother wrongs which fell upon communities in plain sight, which had not\r\nthe wit and virtue to establish their independence. When the city pipe\r\nline was opened in 1891 the city began supplying gas to its citizens\r\nat 8 cents a thousand for houses. The private companies were charging\r\n12 cents a thousand, or 50 per cent. more. Profits were such at this\r\ncharge of 12 cents a thousand feet that in some tracts single wells\r\nwould repay the cost of the land every four days and two hours, or\r\neighty-nine times a year. Since then the private corporations have\r\nraised their rate to 25 cents. The city continued the rates at 8 cents\r\nuntil December, 1892, when the rate was advanced to 15 cents. This\r\nadvance would have been unnecessary but for the losses arising from the\r\nobstructions placed in the way of the city plant.\r\n\r\nThe people of Toledo got their gas lands, pipe line, and street mains\r\nfor an outlay of $1,181,743 up to the end of 1891,[547] and $1,294,467\r\nup to the end of 1892. In the canvass before the election in 1889 their\r\nopponents declared that $4,000,000 would be required.\r\n\r\nPrivate enterprise cannot find rhetoric strong enough to express its\r\ncontempt for the inefficiency, costliness, and despotisms of public\r\nenterprise. Private enterprise put at $6,000,000--twelve times the\r\namount of the property they reported for taxation--the \"capital\"\r\nstock invested by the two natural-gas companies. The city pipe line\r\nwas capitalized (bonded) at just what it cost--a little more than\r\na million. The city trustees built a better pipe line than private\r\nenterprise had laid. The private line was of cheap iron of 14-feet\r\nlengths, while Toledo's was in 24-feet pieces. One of the private lines\r\nwas laid with rubber joints and in shallow trenches, in many places of\r\nnot more than plough depth. It leaked at almost every joint; its course\r\ncould be traced across the fields by the smell of gas and the blighted\r\nline of vegetation. There were frequent explosions from the escaping\r\ngas; lives and property were much endangered. The city line was laid\r\nwith lead joints, and had every device that engineering experience\r\ncould suggest for its success, and was so constructed that it could\r\nbe cleaned or repaired, and freed from liquids interfering with the\r\nflow of gas, without shutting off the supply--features the other pipe\r\nhad not. The action of the city trustees had to endure the microscopic\r\nscrutiny of friend and foe. No one was able to show as to a single acre\r\nthat the title was defective, or that it could have been bought for\r\nless, or to find any taint of a job in the construction of the pipe. A\r\ncommittee of the city council sat and probed for six weeks, but failed\r\nto find any evidence whatever to confirm the reported \"irregularities.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Toledo will save in one year by the difference between the actual\r\ncost at which its people can supply themselves and the price the\r\nprivate companies would have charged, to pay dividends on $6,000,000 of\r\n\"capital,\" is only part of the story. The profit of the city enterprise\r\nis to be estimated by its competitive effect upon the charge of the\r\nprivate companies. These have been kept down in Toledo much below the\r\naverage of other towns, where they have been as high as 35 cents a\r\nthousand. If the city had not supplied a foot of gas this check on the\r\nprivate companies would make its pipe line still a good investment.\r\nThe people, when it is in full operation, can pay the cost of the\r\nsystem complete out of the savings of a few years, then pay off the\r\nentire city debt, and have a large income left for public buildings,\r\nroads, parks. Or by reduction of price they can keep this sum in their\r\npockets, where it will do quite as much for the general welfare as if\r\nit had been transferred to the bank accounts of non-residents.\r\n\r\nThe city, at the end of 1891, had 3299-3/4 acres of gas land. In March,\r\n1892, forty-five wells were giving over 50,000,000 cubic feet of gas,\r\nequal to 3500 tons of anthracite coal. Its income from the sale of gas\r\nwas at the rate of $20,032 a month in winter, and $10,221 in summer.\r\nAn investigation made in March, 1892, by a committee appointed by the\r\nmayor at the request of the city's gas trustees, showed that an income\r\ncould be counted on ($180,000) ample to pay all expenses ($128,120),\r\nincluding interest, rentals, and the cost of drilling new wells, and\r\nprovide a small fund annually ($51,880) for the extinction of the\r\nbonded debt. The committee said: \"We believe that if the gas plant is\r\nproperly managed upon prudent business principles and methods, that it\r\ncan be made a profitable investment for the city and her people; that\r\nthe class who will derive the greatest benefit is the laboring class,\r\nwho pay rent or taxes upon their little homes, and to whom the matter\r\nof cheap fuel is quite an item in the total amount of annual expenses;\r\nand we believe it to be the duty of every good citizen to aid and\r\nencourage this class.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the results with a charge of 8 cents a thousand. Gas to\r\nthe amount of $167,899 had been sold up to August 1, 1892. Between\r\nNovember, 1891, and August, 1892, the city earned on the million\r\ninvested the sum of $150,000, or nearly one-ninth of the cost of\r\nthe plant, and this at the low price of 8 cents a thousand feet.\r\nUnobstructed by its enemies and at the price charged by the private\r\ncompanies, 20 cents a thousand, the city would pay for its entire plant\r\nin less than three years.\r\n\r\nTo discourage the public from going forward with its pipe line the\r\nprivate companies \"talked poor.\" In an interview in the public\r\npress the president of the principal company said it had paid but\r\n9 per cent. in dividends in two and a half years. The net earnings\r\nwere stated to be \"about 4 per cent. per annum on the capital,\"\r\n$4,000,000;[548] for the smaller company they were figured out to be\r\nat the rate of a fraction less than 1 per cent. a year on its capital\r\nof $2,000,000.[549] \"We feel sore and hurt about it,\" said the \"direct\r\nrepresentative\" of the oil combination to the citizens' committee; \"we\r\nhave seen no good return from our money.\" \"It has pretty nearly swamped\r\nus,\" said the president of the company. The citizens of Toledo were\r\nshrewd enough to ask themselves how long their antagonists would have\r\nbeen likely to remain in a business which paid only 3 per cent., and\r\nwas as \"hazardous\" and \"shortlived\" as they pictured it to be. Careful\r\nestimates made by close students of the question calculated that of\r\nthe $6,000,000 of paper capital \"invested\" in the two companies which\r\nsupplied Toledo and other cities, $1,125,000 was the proportion of\r\nactual cash devoted to Toledo. The receipts upon this Toledo investment\r\nin the two and three-quarters years between the opening of the business\r\nand the date at which, by the contract with the city, the council was\r\nto make new rates (June 30, 1890), were, as nearly as can be calculated\r\nfrom the figures of their report, $1,300,000 greater than the expenses\r\nof the Toledo business. This is a profit of 115 per cent. In less than\r\nthree years the total investment had been repaid by the profits, and,\r\nin addition, enough to have paid dividends of 5 per cent. a year.\r\nThis was an estimate, but it was an estimate publicly made from the\r\ncompanies' figures, and by a responsible man. It remained unchallenged\r\nat a time when every cranny of fact and fiction was being rummaged for\r\nmissiles to fling at the people.\r\n\r\nWhen the citizens' committee sought a reduction in price, the companies\r\npointed to the small dividend their stockholders had had. In the face\r\nof the fact that they had received but a 3-per-cent. dividend the\r\nprevious year, no business man, their spokesman said, could ask them\r\nto reduce their price. It is for such uses that shrewd men \"water\"\r\nstock. The surface of the capital is broadened, so that even large\r\ndividends can cover it only by being spread out very thin. This 3 per\r\ncent. a year was on $6,000,000 of dilution, representing a solid, at\r\nthe most, of only $1,500,000. The balance sheets of the companies\r\nshowed that the companies had paid small dividends for the additional\r\nreason that a large part of their receipts had been reinvested in\r\nlands, wells, and extensions of the pipes and plants.\r\n\r\nThe people are often assured that these false figures of capitalization\r\nare merely romantic and do them no harm, because charges must be\r\ngoverned by the \"laws of trade.\" One of the \"laws of trade\" that\r\nregulates the \"market price\" of such commodities as transportation,\r\nlight, water, gas, furnished by the help of the public franchises, is\r\nthe power of the public to regulate. This public power depends upon the\r\npublic knowledge and the public disposition. To make the public believe\r\nthat the profit of serving it has been only 3 per cent. a year, when it\r\nhas been nearer 50 per cent., is to manipulate public opinion, the most\r\npotent of all the \"laws of trade,\" for a competing supply cannot be got\r\neasily, often not at all.\r\n\r\nA committee of citizens were invited by the representatives of the gas\r\ncompanies to meet them to verify the statements of the companies as to\r\nthe unprofitableness of the business, and the inexpediency of municipal\r\nself-supply. But when the committee wanted to know what had been the\r\nreal cost of the private pipe lines, on the $6,000,000 nominal capital\r\nof which the people were expected to pay dividends, they could not get\r\nany satisfaction. The companies would only give an estimate. To the\r\nrequest for more definite information, the reply of both companies\r\nwas, \"We have not got the books of the contractors; we have never\r\nhad them. We have no means of knowing the actual cost of the Toledo\r\nplant, or any books to show it.[550] We have no papers or documents in\r\nregard to the construction of this line.\" It came to light later that\r\none of the companies in the oil trust had constructed the pipe line\r\nfor the gas company, and at a price approximating the large figures\r\nclaimed. The company that built this pipe line is a ring within the oil\r\nand gas ring, always on hand for such contracts and at like margins\r\nof profit, and it is owned almost wholly by the principals of the\r\ncombination.[551] The people--mostly Ohioans--who took the minority 40\r\nper cent. of stock of the gas company were really the \"simple greens.\"\r\nAll that was paid for this construction by those who were members\r\nboth of the inside ring and the gas company came back to them; their\r\nassociates in the minority paid, but got nothing back. It was from the\r\nlatter came the profits of this contract to the insiders.\r\n\r\nThe people of Dayton had a similar experience. Their natural-gas\r\ncompany demanded an advance to 25 cents a thousand, and met a committee\r\nof the people to prove that the demand was proper. But it would not let\r\nthe people know what the actual investment was to make which good it\r\nsought to tax the people. The books containing the construction account\r\nwere \"not accessible.\" \"The actual cost to construct the plant is what\r\nwe most desired to know,\" the committee reported. As at Toledo, so at\r\nDayton; all private enterprise would let its customer-subjects know was\r\nwhat it wanted them to pay; information to show what they ought to pay\r\n\"was not accessible.\" What the profits were elsewhere can be guessed at\r\nfrom the fact that in Pennsylvania $36 a year was charged in most of\r\nthe towns for cooking-stoves. In Toledo the charge was $19.50 a year.\r\n\r\nAlmost every day after the pipe line had been decided on the people saw\r\nsomething done, showing how well founded their apprehensions had been.\r\nThe power to discriminate in rates the people saw used by the private\r\ncompanies for selfish and anti-public purposes, precisely as they had\r\nforeseen it would be. When the fight for and against the city pipe\r\nline was on, one of the gas companies sought to enlist the strong men\r\nin their support by making them special rates, pursuing the tactics of\r\ndivide and conquer. Manufacturers with influence useful in controlling\r\npublic sentiment were conceded special rates. Others were given to\r\nunderstand that any lack of \"loyalty\" would be followed by punishment.\r\nSo effective were these alternating methods of boodling and bulldozing\r\nthat the council committee on gas, in a subsequent investigation, found\r\nit almost impossible to obtain any information from manufacturers as\r\nto their use of natural gas for fuel. What little they did secure was\r\nunder injunctions of secrecy. The committee found that some were made\r\nto pay twice, some three, and some even four times as much as was paid\r\nby neighbors for like service. The only rule for charging seemed to be\r\nto favor those who had \"influence.\" This was using municipal franchise\r\njust as the franchise of the highways had been used in their behalf by\r\nthe railways. An assembly of divines could not be trusted with such\r\npower over their fellows.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fostoria incident the people of Toledo had another\r\nillustration given them of how wisely they had builded. The gas supply\r\nof the people of Columbus, Ohio, was shut off arbitrarily and suddenly\r\nin midwinter--January, 1891--and they were informed that the company\r\nwould supply them with no more gas unless the City Council would raise\r\nthe price to 25 cents a thousand feet from 10 cents. The gas had not\r\nfailed. The caverns that discharge gas at 25 cents a thousand will let\r\nit come just as freely at 10 cents. The council had fixed the price\r\nat 10 cents, and the company had accepted it. The demand for a higher\r\nprice was close upon an increase in the capital stock of the Columbus\r\ncompany from $1,000,000 to $1,750,000. More stock called for more\r\ndividends, and this was one way to get it--to strike this sudden blow,\r\nand then to say, after the manner of Silas Wegg, \"Undone for double\r\nthe money!\" It was for the power to do this at Toledo, to preserve the\r\npower of doing it everywhere else, that hell and earth were being moved\r\nin Toledo to prevent the people from serving themselves and setting an\r\nexample to the rest of America. In the same way the gas was turned off\r\nat Sidney, Ohio, and not turned on again until, upon the application of\r\nthe mayor, the company was ordered to do it by the courts. \"There is a\r\ngreat deal of suffering here,\" the press reported, \"and it is feared\r\nthat several deaths will result from exposure.\"\r\n\r\nThe people did not fail to comprehend the significance of criticisms\r\nin the Toledo organ on the municipal water supply. Monopoly must go on\r\nconquering and to conquer, or be overborne by the ever-recuperating\r\nresentment which rises against it, freshened with each new day. Nature\r\nhates monopoly, says Emerson. The studied attack on the city water\r\nworks was believed to be meant to prepare the people to intrust that as\r\nwell as the gas supply to the trust's \"sound business men\" and \"private\r\nenterprise.\"\r\n\r\nFinding that the council would not bend to the demands as to rates,\r\nand that the people were too resolute to be in any way diverted from\r\ntheir pipe line, Toledo was given some such doses as could be ventured\r\nupon of the Fostoria and Columbus medicine. The company shut gas off\r\nfrom those who would not pay the increased rate. It deprived public\r\ninstitutions of their fuel. It refused to supply gas to a new public\r\nschool whose building was planned for natural gas. As the city's pipe\r\nline was not completed, the children had to go cold. The winter of\r\n1891-2 was the first winter the city's pipe line was in operation. With\r\nthe first cold snap, at the end of November, great distress and danger\r\nwere brought upon the people by a lawless act, done secretly by some\r\nunknown person to the city's pipe line. One of the main pipes in the\r\ngas-field, through which flowed the product of two of the largest gas\r\nwells, was disconnected, so that its gas could no longer reach Toledo.\r\nWho did this was never discovered.[552]\r\n\r\nDefeat, final and irrevocable, crowned the unvarying series of\r\ndefeat which the private companies had suffered everywhere and in\r\neverything--in public meetings, in the Legislature, in the gas-fields,\r\nat the polls, in the courts, in the sale of the bonds, and in the\r\ncompetition with the city. The City Council of Toledo, advised by its\r\nlawyers that it could recover damages from those responsible for the\r\nlosses brought upon the city by the opposition to its pipe line, has\r\nhad suit brought for that purpose. April 14, 1893, City Solicitor\r\nRead began proceedings to recover $1,000,000 damages from members of\r\nthe oil combination and the various individuals who had been used as\r\nstalking-horses in the campaign. At the next meeting of the Common\r\nCouncil several citizens of the \"influential\" persuasion assisted the\r\nmayor in trying to coax and bully the council to abandon the suit, but\r\nwithout success. The council were threatened with a financial boycott\r\nto prevent the sale in future of any of the bonds of the city, but it\r\nrefused to be terrorized.\r\n\r\nApril 8, 1893, the natural-gas trustees of Toledo had the happiness\r\nof being able to give formal notice to the city auditor that no taxes\r\nneed be levied to pay the interest on the gas bonds, as it \"can easily\r\nbe met from the revenues derived from the sale of natural gas.\" The\r\ncity pipe line was on a paying basis at last. Toledo had vindicated\r\nits claim to be a free city. The completion of the enterprise had\r\nbeen delayed three years. A loss of not less than two million dollars\r\nhad been laid on the city, but its victory was worth many times that.\r\nToledo's victory showed the country, in full and successful detail,\r\na plan of campaign of which Columbus had merely given a hint. It was\r\nnot a local affair, but one of even more than national importance, for\r\nthe oil combination has invaded four continents. This struggle and its\r\nresults of good omen will pass into duly recorded history as a warning\r\nand an encouragement to people everywhere who wish to lead the life of\r\nthe commonwealth.\r\n\r\n NOTE.--For the year ending December 31, 1893, the city trustees report\r\n that they sold gas to the amount of $139,066. The city owns 5433 acres\r\n of gas territory, and has 85 wells, 73 miles of pipe outside the city,\r\n and 91 miles in the city. Since the gas began to flow the sales have\r\n amounted to $388,540. Out of the receipts the debt has been reduced\r\n $60,000, besides refunding $67,000 to those who advanced the money for\r\n piping the streets. While doing this the plant has been considerably\r\n enlarged. The city accomplished this while charging the people but\r\n 15 cents a thousand, while the gas companies of the trust charged\r\n 25 cents a thousand. Had the city been permitted to act without\r\n obstruction, the cost of the gas plant would have been long since\r\n fully paid, and the price of gas made still lower.[553]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\"YOU ARE A--SENATOR\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to control the men who control the highways?\r\n\r\nThe railroads have become the main rivers of trade and travel, and to\r\ncontrol them has become one of our hardest problems in the field where\r\npolitics and industry meet. The Duke of Wellington exhorted Parliament\r\n\"not to forget, in legislating upon this subject, the old idea of the\r\nKing's Highway.\" But here, as well as there, the little respect paid\r\nby the Legislature at first to this idea soon vanished. In England, as\r\nwell as in America, the State, in giving some citizens the right, for\r\ntheir private profit, to take the property of others by force, legally,\r\nfor railways, began by limiting strictly the power so acquired. Then,\r\npassing under the control of that which it had created, the State\r\nabandoned its attempts to control. Now the State is retracing its\r\nway, and for many years has been struggling painfully to recover its\r\nlost authority. In the first English charters there were the minutest\r\nregulations as to freight and passenger charges, and the right of\r\ncitizens generally to put their own cars on the tracks was sacredly\r\nguarded.\r\n\r\nThe railroads became too strong to submit to this, and the success with\r\nwhich the teachings of Adam Smith were applied to the abolition of\r\nthe old-fashioned restraints on trade bred a furor against any social\r\ncontrol of industry. These limitations were left out of new charters,\r\nand for fair play were revised out of the old charters. After a brief\r\ndream of this _laissez faire_, England began, in 1844, investigating\r\nand legislating, and, after nearly thirty years of experiments and\r\nfailures, established the railway commission in 1873. This was a step\r\nforward, but has not proved the solvent it was expected to be. The\r\nexpense of getting a decision from the commission and the courts to\r\nwhich the road can appeal from the commission has frightened people\r\nfrom making complaints. \"A complainant,\" says Hadley, \"is a marked man,\r\nand the commission cannot protect him against the vengeance of the\r\nrailroads. A town fares no better ... even the [British] War Department\r\nis afraid. It has grievances, but it dares not make them public for\r\nfear of reprisals.\"[554]\r\n\r\nThe course of events in the United States was much the same. The first\r\nrailroad powers were carefully limited. The early charters regulated\r\nthe charges, limited the profits, gave citizens the right to put their\r\nprivate carriages on the road, and reserved to the State the right to\r\ntake possession of the railroad upon proper payment. But as early as\r\n1846 the railroads had grown strong enough--in the revision of the\r\nConstitution of New York, for example--to secure an almost complete\r\nsurrender of these public safe-guards.[555]\r\n\r\nBut it was seen immediately in America, as in England, that the new\r\ninstitution could not be left in the uncontrolled hands of individuals.\r\nIt created simultaneously two revolutions, each one of the most\r\nmomentous in modern civilization. It made the steam-engine master in\r\ntransportation, as it had already become in manufacturing. It made the\r\npublic highways the private property of a few citizens. An agitation\r\narose among the people--to-day stronger because more necessary than\r\never--and they began to seek what they have not yet found: means of\r\nregulating the relations between new rich and new poor, and protecting\r\nthe private interests of all from the private interests of the few who\r\nhad this double sovereignty. As early as 1857 New York established a\r\ncommission for the regulation of the railways. But the railroads within\r\na year procured a law abolishing it, bribing the leading commissioner\r\nto make no opposition in consideration of receiving from them $25,000,\r\nthe whole amount of his salary for five years. \"I was the attorney\r\nof the Erie Railway at that time; I specially used to attend to\r\nlegislation that they desired to effect or oppose.... I remember the\r\nappointment of that commission.... We agreed that if they\" (the leading\r\nrailroad commissioner) \"would not oppose the repeal of the law we would\r\npay $25,000, and have done with the commission; it was embarrassing....\r\nThe law was repealed, and we paid the money, I think.\" \"If the\r\ncommission had been a useless one,\" said the counsel of the New York\r\nChamber of Commerce before the Legislative Committee, \"the railroads\r\nwould not have parted with their money to get rid of it.\"[556]\r\n\r\nThirty of the States and Territories of the Union had established\r\ncommissions or passed laws to regulate the railroads before Congress,\r\nin 1887, used its power under the Constitution to regulate commerce\r\namong the States, and passed the Interstate Commerce law, establishing\r\nthe National Interstate Commerce Commission, in the hope that it might\r\nprotect the people. Congress did not act until 1887, although for years\r\ndifferent sections of the public, in their efforts to find a cure for\r\nthe new evils which had come with the new good, had sought to set in\r\naction their representatives in Washington. The \"Granger movement\" of\r\n1871, 1872, and 1873, with its \"Granger legislation\" by the States\r\nagainst the railroads, is one of the never-to-be-forgotten waves of\r\npublic commotion over this problem which took on its acutest form in\r\nthe oil regions. Illinois, California, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,\r\nRhode Island, Wisconsin, and Iowa established railway commissions, or\r\nput stringent regulations on the statute-books at this time. Public\r\nopinion did not cease to demand action by the national government\r\nunder the constitutional power of Congress to regulate interstate\r\ncommerce, and became clamorous. Petitions poured in by the hundreds,\r\npublic meetings were held, chambers of commerce and boards of trade and\r\nanti-monopoly conventions passed resolutions of urgency. This was one\r\nof the main issues in the election of the 44th Congress.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Hopkins, of Pennsylvania, rose in his place in the\r\nHouse of Representatives on May 16, 1876, and asked unanimous consent\r\nto offer a resolution for the appointment of a committee of five\r\nto investigate the charges that \"many industries are crippled and\r\nthreatened with extreme prostration\" by the discrimination of the\r\nrailroads, and to report a bill for the regulation of interstate\r\ncommerce. This was the first move to reopen in Congress the great\r\nquestion, first on the order of the day both in England and in America,\r\nwhich had been smothered by the Committee of Commerce of 1872. It\r\nrequired unanimous consent to bring the resolution before the House.\r\n\r\n\"Instantly,\" said Representative Hopkins, in describing the occurrence\r\nafterwards,[557] \"I heard the fatal words 'I object.' The objector was\r\nMr. Henry B. Payne, of Cleveland.\" Other members appealed to Mr. Payne\r\nto withdraw his objection.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker of the House: \"Does the gentleman from Ohio withdraw his\r\nobjection?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Payne: \"I do not.\"\r\n\r\nIn a private conference which followed between Representative Payne\r\nand Representative Hopkins, the former said, as Mr. Hopkins relates:\r\n\"What he objected to in my resolution was the creation of a special\r\ncommittee; but if I would again offer it and ask that it be referred\r\nto the Committee of Commerce he would not object. I thought perhaps\r\nthere was something reasonable in his objection. A special committee\r\nwould probably require a clerk, which would be an expense. He looked to\r\nme so like a frugal Democrat, who had great confidence in the regular\r\norder of established committees and did not want the country to be\r\ntaxed for clerks attending to the business of special committees--I say\r\nthat he so impressed me that, as the record will show, I adopted his\r\nsuggestion.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Committee of Commerce to which the investigation was\r\naccordingly referred began its investigation, a member of the oil\r\ncombination, not then, as later, a member of the Senate, took his seat\r\nby the ear of the chairman, who was from his State, \"presiding,\" as\r\nthe oil producers said in a public appeal, \"behind the seat of the\r\nchairman.\"[558] The financial officer of the oil combination was called\r\nas a witness, but refused to answer the questions of the committee as\r\nto the operations of the company or its relations with the railroads.\r\nThe vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad also refused to answer\r\nquestions. On the plea of needing time to decide how to compel these\r\nwitnesses to answer, the committee let the railroad vice-president\r\ngo until he should be recalled. But the committee never decided, and\r\nthe witnesses were never recalled. The committee never reported to\r\nCongress, made no complaint of the contempt of its witnesses, and the\r\ninvestigation of 1876, like that of 1872, came to a mute and inglorious\r\nend.\r\n\r\nWhen Representative Hopkins applied to the clerk of the committee for\r\nthe testimony, he was told, to his amazement, that it could not be\r\nfound. \"Judge Reagan,\" he relates,[559] \"who was a stanch friend of the\r\nbill\"--for the regulation of the railroads--\"and very earnest for the\r\ninvestigation, and who at the time was a member of the committee, told\r\nme that it had been stolen.\"[560]\r\n\r\nEight years after \"I object\" the people of Ohio were a suppliant before\r\nthe Senate of the United States. They believed that their dearest\r\nrights had been violated, and they prayed for redress to the only body\r\nwhich had power to give it. Officially by the voice of both Houses of\r\nthe State Legislature and the governor, unofficially by the press, by\r\nthe public appeals of leading men, by the petitions of citizens, press,\r\nleaders, and people, regardless of party, the commonwealth asserted\r\nthat the greatest wrong possible in a republic had been done their\r\nmembers, and sued for restitution. They declared it to be their belief\r\nthat against their will, as the result of violation of the laws, a man\r\nhad taken their seat in the Senate of the United States who was not\r\ntheir senator, that they had been denied representation by the senator\r\nof their choice; and they demanded that, in accordance with immemorial\r\nusage, the evidence they had to offer should be examined, and their\r\nright of representation in the Senate of the United States restored\r\nto them, if it should be found to have been taken from them. After\r\nthe Legislature had examined sixty-four witnesses, the Ohio House of\r\nRepresentatives resolved that \"ample testimony was adduced to warrant\r\nthe belief that ... the seat of Henry B. Payne in the United States\r\nSenate was purchased by the corrupt use of money.\" The Ohio Senate\r\ncharged that \"the election of Henry B. Payne as Senator of the United\r\nStates from Ohio ... was procured and brought about by the corrupt use\r\nof money, ... and by other corrupt means and practices.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Houses passed with these resolutions an urgent request for\r\ninvestigation by the Senate of the United States.[561]\r\n\r\nMr. Payne's election by the Legislature was a thunder-clap to the\r\npeople of Ohio. They did not know he was a candidate. Who was to be\r\nUnited States Senator was of course one of the issues in the election\r\nof the Ohio Legislature of 1884, and the Democratic voters who elected\r\nthe majority of that Legislature had sent them to the State Capitol to\r\nmake George H. Pendleton or Durbin Ward senator. One of the leading\r\nnewspaper men of the State testified: \"I went over the entire State\r\nduring the campaign.... Out of the eighty-eight counties I attended\r\nfifty-four Democratic conventions and wrote them up, giving the\r\nsentiment of the people as nearly as I could, and during that entire\r\ncanvass I never heard a candidate for the Legislature say that he was\r\nfor Henry B. Payne for United States Senator; but every man I ever\r\ntalked with was either for George H. Pendleton or General Ward. I think\r\nout of the Democratic candidates throughout the State I conversed with\r\nat least two-thirds of them.\"[562] As was afterwards stated before the\r\nSenate of the United States by the representatives of the people of\r\nOhio, \"He was in no wise publicly connected with the canvass for the\r\nSenate, nor had the most active, honorable, and best-posted politicians\r\nin the State heard his name in connection with the senatorial office\r\nuntil subsequent to the October election [of the Legislature]. He was\r\nabsolutely without following.\"[563]\r\n\r\nThe Democratic constituencies sent their legislators to vote for\r\nPendleton and Ward, but between the receipt and the execution of\r\nthis trust from the people a secret charm was put to work of such a\r\npotency that the people woke up to find that the representative who\r\nhad betrayed them in Congress in 1876 was their senator, instead of\r\none of their real leaders. The people had been digging oil wells for\r\ntwenty years that all the value might flow into the bank accounts of a\r\nfew interceptors; they had been building railroads and pipe lines that\r\ntheir business and property might be transported into the same hands;\r\nthey had organized agitation and conducted a national anti-monopoly\r\ncampaign all over the country, only to see the men who were to have\r\nbeen investigated take command of the inquiry. The people had had\r\nenough such experience not to be surprised that when they started to\r\nmake a beloved leader senator it was their enemy who came out of the\r\nvoting mill with the senatorial toga upon his shoulders. But terrible\r\nwas the moral storm that broke forth out of the hearts of the people\r\nof Ohio. The votes they had thrown, like roses to garland the head\r\nof a hero, had been transformed as they went, by a black magic, into\r\nmissiles of destruction, and had fallen upon him like the stones that\r\nslew Stephen.\r\n\r\nThe press, without regard to party, gave voice to the popular wrath.\r\nScores of the Democratic newspapers of Ohio went into mourning. One of\r\nthem said: \"The whole Democratic Legislature was made rotten by the\r\nmoney that was used to buy and sell the members like so many sheep.\"\r\nMany representative Democrats of the State privately and publicly\r\ndeclared their belief in the charges of corruption. Allen G. Thurman,\r\nwho had been a senator and representative at Washington, said: \"There\r\nis something that shocks me in the idea of crushing men like Pendleton\r\nand Ward, who have devoted the best portion of their lives to the\r\nmaintenance of Democracy, by a combination against them of personal\r\nhatred and overgrown wealth.... I want to see all the Democrats have\r\na fair chance according to their merits, and do not want to see a\r\npolitical cutthroat bossism inaugurated for the benefit of a close\r\nparty corporation or syndicate.\" Again he said: \"Syndicates purchase\r\nthe people's agents, and honest men stand aghast.\"[564]\r\n\r\nIt was the \"irony of fate\" that this Legislature, like the 44th\r\nCongress, had been specially elected to represent opposition to\r\nmonopolies. Of course the Legislature that had done this thing was not\r\nto be persuaded, bullied, or shamed into any step towards exposure or\r\nreparation. But the people, usually so forgetful, nursed their wrath.\r\nThey made the scandal the issue of the next State election, and put\r\nthe Legislature into other hands. The new Legislature then forwarded\r\nformal charges to the Senate of the United States, and a demand for an\r\ninvestigation. The State of Ohio made its solemn accusation and prayer\r\nfor an investigation through all the organs of utterance it had: the\r\npress of both parties; honored men, both Republican and Democratic;\r\nboth Houses of the State Legislature and its senator whose seat was\r\nunchallenged--an aggregate representing a vast majority of the people\r\nof the State. The Hon. John Little and the Hon. Benjamin Butterworth,\r\nformer Attorney-General of Ohio, both members of Congress, had been\r\ndelegated to present the case of the State. They made formal charges,\r\nbased on evidence given under oath or communicated in writing by\r\nreputable citizens, who were willing to testify under oath. None of\r\nthe matter was presented on mere hearsay or rumor.[565] No charge\r\nwas made to connect Senator Payne personally with the corruption. His\r\ndenials and those of his friends of any participation by him were\r\ntherefore mere evasions of the actual charge--that his election had\r\nbeen corruptly procured for him, not by him. The substance of their\r\naccusation, as contained in their statement and the papers forwarded by\r\nthe Legislature, was as follows:[566]\r\n\r\nThat among the chief managers of Mr. Payne's canvass, and those who\r\ncontrolled its financial operations, were four of the principal\r\nmembers in Ohio of the oil trust: its treasurer, the vice-president\r\nof one of its most important subordinate companies, its Cincinnati\r\nrepresentative, and another--all of whom were named.\r\n\r\nThat one of these four, naming him, who was given the financial\r\nmanagement of the Payne campaign at Columbus, carried $65,000 with\r\nhim, \"next to his skin,\" to Columbus to use in the election, as he had\r\nstated to an intimate friend whose name would be given.\r\n\r\nThat the cashier of the bank in Cleveland, where the treasurer of the\r\noil combination kept one of his bank accounts, would testify that this\r\nmoney was procured on a check given by this treasurer of the oil trust\r\nto another of its officials, and passed over by him to its Cincinnati\r\nagent, who drew out the cash.\r\n\r\nThat the back room used by the Payne manager at Columbus as his office\r\ndisplayed such large amounts of money in plain view that it looked like\r\na bank, and that the employé who acted there as his clerk stated upon\r\nhis return home that he had never seen so much money handled together\r\nin his life.\r\n\r\nThat a prominent gentleman, going to the room used by the Payne\r\nmanagers for a \"converter,\" had said that he saw \"canvas bags and coin\r\nbags and cases for greenbacks littered and scattered around the room\r\nand on the table and on the floor ... with something green sticking\r\nout,\" which he found to be money.\r\n\r\nThat members who had been earnest supporters of Pendleton were taken\r\none by one by certain guides to this room which looked like a bank,\r\nand came out with an intense and suddenly developed dislike of\r\ncivil-service reform (Mr. Pendleton's measure), and proceeded to vote\r\nfor Mr. Payne; and that these conversions were uniformly attended with\r\nthrift, sudden, extensive, and so irreconcilable with their known means\r\nof making money as to be a matter of remark among their neighbors; and\r\nthat \"the reasons for the change (of vote) were kept mainly in this\r\nroom, passed by delivery, and could be used to buy real estate.\"\r\n\r\nThat this use of money in large amounts to procure the sudden\r\nconversions of Pendleton legislators to Payne would be shown by\r\nnumerous witnesses, generally Democrats, several of them lawyers of\r\ngreat distinction and high ability.\r\n\r\nThat the editor and proprietor of the principal Democratic journal\r\nin Ohio had stated, as was sworn to, that he had spent $100,000 to\r\nelect Payne, and that it cost a great deal of money to get those\r\nrepresentatives and senators to vote for Payne, and they had to be\r\nbought. \"It took money, and a good deal of it, to satisfy them,\" and\r\nhe complained that the oil trust had not reciprocated in kind. This\r\nstatement was made by one of his editorial writers, who after making\r\nit was discharged. The latter subsequently put it into the form of an\r\naffidavit.\r\n\r\nThat Senator Pendleton would testify that more than enough of the\r\nlegislators to give him the election had been pledged to him.\r\n\r\nThat the number of members of the Ohio Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives who had been paid money to vote for Mr. Payne was so\r\ngreat that without their votes and influence his nomination would have\r\nbeen out of the question.\r\n\r\nThat a legislator who had been violently opposed to Payne, then changed\r\nand became violently rich, had acknowledged that the treasurer of\r\nthe oil trust, out of gratitude for what he had done, had \"loaned\"\r\nhim several thousand dollars--\"a case,\" said the representative of\r\nOhio before the United States Senate, \"of a man becoming well-to-do by\r\nborrowing money.\"\r\n\r\nThat legislators who were so poor before the election that everything\r\nthey had was mortgaged, and they had to beg or borrow funds for their\r\nelection expenses, became so prosperous after their sudden conversion\r\nto Payne that they paid off their debts, rebuilt their houses,\r\nfurnished them handsomely, deposited large amounts in the banks, or\r\nopened new bank accounts, bought more property, and that the reasons\r\nthey gave for this new wealth were demonstrably untrue--or impossible.\r\n\r\nThat a member of the Legislature, a State senator, had himself stated\r\nthat he had received $5000 to vote for Payne,[567] and had offered the\r\nsame amount to an associate if he would do the same; and that after the\r\nelection this member opened a new bank account, depositing $2500 in his\r\nwife's name, who immediately transferred it to him.\r\n\r\nThat another member of the Legislature, who changed suddenly after his\r\nelection to the Legislature, and just before the caucus, from a warm\r\nadvocacy of one of the recognized candidates to the support of Payne,\r\nwhen directly charged with having taken a bribe, did not deny it, but\r\n\"became exceedingly sick, white as a sheet, and answered not. He went\r\naway and laid in bed two days.\"\r\n\r\nThat, contrary to all the precedents of Ohio politics, the caucus of\r\nthe majority party was not held until the night before election, so as\r\nto leave no time between the caucus and the election.\r\n\r\nThat, also contrary to the precedents, the nomination was made, not,\r\nas usual, by open vote, but by secret ballot and without debate, on\r\nthe demand of the Payne managers and contrary to the protests of the\r\nopponents, so that it could not be known to the public who the Payne\r\nmen were.\r\n\r\nThat this knowledge was made sure to the Payne managers, who were\r\nto pay for the votes, by the ingenious device of requiring each\r\npurchased legislator to use a coupon ballot furnished by them, the\r\ncorresponding stub of which they kept. These legislators were not paid\r\nfor their votes unless the torn edges of the coupon ballot voted by\r\nthem corresponded with the edge of the stub in the possession of the\r\nmanagers.\r\n\r\nThat responsible men would testify that they had received confessions\r\nfrom members of the Legislature that they had been bribed with money to\r\nvote for Mr. Payne.\r\n\r\nThat two members of the Legislature who had been elected as\r\nanti-monopolists became supporters of Mr. Payne, and were heard\r\ndiscussing together the amount of money they had received, and\r\nquarrelling because one had received more than the other.\r\n\r\nThat a member of the Legislature which was corrupted, standing on the\r\nfloor of the Ohio House of Representatives, pointed out members who\r\nhad been purchased to vote for Payne, saying: \"These members were paid\r\nto vote in the senatorial fight,\" holding a little book in his hand in\r\nwhich he had the names and amounts; but although he made the charges\r\nopenly and defiantly, and although the same charges were made in\r\nRepublican and Democratic papers, no investigation was ordered. Three\r\nattempts to have an investigation made by the Legislature in which the\r\nbribery occurred failed.\r\n\r\nThat a correspondent of a leading Cincinnati daily, sitting on the\r\nfloor of the House, daily charged that the election was procured by\r\nbribery, talked about it generally, and dared the House to investigate\r\nor the accused to sue for libel, and that no such step was taken by\r\neither.\r\n\r\nThat a memorandum of the names of the legislators who sold themselves,\r\nand the amounts they received, had been furnished from a responsible\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nThat on the eve of the election money was sent by draft to twenty-four\r\nof the Democratic candidates for the Legislature, with the promise\r\nof more the next day, and with the statement that thanks for both\r\nremittances were due to one of the prominent members of the oil trust,\r\nwho was named, and two others of Payne's managers, \"they paying most\r\nof it themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThat before the election of the Legislature one of the Payne managers\r\nsent large sums of money amounting to $10,000, or $12,000, perhaps\r\n$13,500--the treasurer of the oil trust \"and other wealthy Democrats\r\ncontributed it-- ... into different parts of the State.\"\r\n\r\nThat the managers of the election absented themselves from the State\r\nduring the legislative investigation, and remained out of reach until\r\nit closed.\r\n\r\nThat during the two and a half years which had passed since these\r\nspecific charges of bribery had been put into circulation, there had\r\nbeen no demand for investigation on the part of those whose reputation\r\nand honor were concerned, but there had been a manifest effort to\r\nprevent investigation.\r\n\r\nThat in addition to these offers of evidence the case against Mr. Payne\r\nwould be greatly strengthened by new and additional testimony from\r\nresponsible sources.\r\n\r\nTestimony was taken by the Legislature that an ex-Lieutenant-Governor\r\nof Ohio, afterwards Consul-General of the United States at Frankfort,\r\nGermany, had been in the room of Payne's manager, had seen that he was\r\nusing money to procure the election, and had so told Mr. Payne before\r\nthe election, and that Mr. Payne's reply--\"You don't suppose I would\r\nendorse anything of that kind, do you?\"--showed that he had understood\r\nthe use of money referred to to be an improper use, thereby fastening\r\nupon Mr. Payne, if true, the knowledge that his agents were corrupting\r\nthe Legislature.\r\n\r\nDuring this deluge of charges Mr. Payne made no denial.\r\n\r\nAfter the investigation had been ordered by the State Legislature,\r\nSenator Payne made an offer to the committee to submit all his private\r\npapers and books of accounts to their examination--an empty offer,\r\nbecause it was not charged that the corruption had been done by him,\r\nbut for him by others. These latter made no such offer, but fled from\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Legislature. When the representatives of the\r\npeople of Ohio appeared before the committee of the United States\r\nSenate on elections, with the offer to prove under oath the foregoing\r\ncharges, he remained voiceless. He did not rise in his place in the\r\nSenate to deny these accusations, as every other senator since the\r\nSenate began had done. He did not go before the committee, nor send\r\nbefore them any witness, or make any explanation. When the Senate\r\ncommittee decided to recommend the Senate not to investigate, and the\r\nrepresentatives of Ohio begged the committee to reconsider, Senator\r\nSherman declared that he heartily agreed with every word of the appeal,\r\nbut Senator Payne still kept silent. The records of Congress show that\r\nhis sole utterance or appearance in this matter in Congress was to make\r\nthe motion that the papers forwarded by the Ohio Legislature should be\r\nsent, as was the routine, to the Committee on Elections. In doing this\r\nhe did more than abstain from the utterance of a word which could be\r\nin any way construed as a demand for investigation. He delivered what\r\nwas, in effect, an appeal to his fellow-senators not to investigate. He\r\nattacked the Legislature for sending the report of its investigation\r\nto Congress, characterizing \"this proceeding--the transmission of\r\nthe testimony here--as an attempt to circulate and give currency to\r\nbaseless gossip and scandal, after everything substantial in the way of\r\na charge had been discredited and disproved.\" In conclusion he left the\r\nmatter to the committee \"for such disposition of it as they may find to\r\nbe in accordance with dignity and justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe Legislature which made the investigation selected as the reason for\r\nordering it the fact that a well-known citizen had just repeated in\r\nan open letter in the public prints the charges of bribery which had\r\nbeen made already hundreds of times. When this citizen was called upon\r\nto testify before the Legislature he stated that, as his information\r\nwas derived from others, he had no personal proof to offer of his own\r\nknowledge that bribery had been committed. Referring to this, Mr. Payne\r\nsaid to his colleagues of the Senate:\r\n\r\n\"Thus fell all that the investigation was originally based upon.\"[568]\r\n\r\nThis was not true. The witness furnished the committee with the names\r\nof the men on whose authority he had spoken, and through whom evidence\r\nbased on personal knowledge could be procured as to the truth of\r\nthe charges.[569] Therefore the statement, \"Thus fell all that the\r\ninvestigation was originally based upon,\" so far as it was believed by\r\nthe senators, deceived them. The State Legislature could not compel\r\nthe witnesses to testify. Only the United States Senate could do this,\r\nand it was deterred from doing so by this concealment of the fact that\r\nthe investigation, instead of falling because of no basis, had struck\r\nfirmer ground. The proffer of evidence was of such a character that,\r\nas has been well said, none of the lawyers of the Senate committee\r\nwho voted against recommending investigation \"would have failed to\r\nrecommend thorough investigation of such an incident if it had been\r\nrelevant to an alleged title set up against a private client.\"[570]\r\nBut the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections--Senators Pugh,\r\nSaulsbury, Vance, and Eustis voting against Hoar and Frye--recommended\r\nthe Senate not to investigate, and the Senate adopted this report.\r\n\r\nNo one had expected this. The unbroken precedents of the Senate had\r\nmade it a matter of course in public expectation that the investigation\r\nwould be made. A convention of Ohio editors, sending a memorial for\r\na reconsideration, said: \"No instance has yet arisen in the history\r\nof the Senate where specific and well-supported charges of bribery in\r\na senatorial election, preferred by the Legislature of a State, have\r\nnot been promptly investigated by the Senate. In fact, so jealous has\r\nthe Senate been of its own integrity and honor that it has heretofore\r\npromptly ordered investigations upon the memorials of citizens, and in\r\nother cases upon the memorial of individual members of a Legislature\r\ncharging fraud in senatorial elections.\" In so doing the Senate, to\r\nadopt the language used by the chairman of the Committee on Elections,\r\nSenator Hoar, declared that \"it is indifferent to the question\r\nwhether its seats are to be in the future the subject of bargain\r\nand sale, or may be presented by a few millionaires as a compliment\r\nto a friend.\"[571] \"This matter never can be quieted,\" said Senator\r\nSherman in the debate in the Senate. \"There are six or seven men who\r\nare known--I could name them--who, if they were brought before this\r\nCommittee on Privileges and Elections, would settle this matter forever\r\none way or the other in my judgment.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate decided that such a charge, accompanied by such offers of\r\nproof, did not deserve its attention. The trial of \"even a criminal\r\naccusation,\" said the minority of the committee, \"requires only the\r\noath of the accuser who is justified if he have probable cause.\"\r\nThe minority, Senators Hoar and Frye, further said: \"It will not be\r\nquestioned that in every one of these cases there is abundant probable\r\ncause which would justify a complaint, and compel a grand-jury or\r\nmagistrate to issue process and make an investigation. Is the Senate to\r\ndeny to the people of a great State, speaking through their Legislature\r\nand their representative citizens, the only opportunity for a hearing\r\nof this momentous case which can exist under the Constitution? The\r\nquestion now is not whether the case is proved--it is only whether it\r\nshall be inquired into. That has never yet been done. It cannot be done\r\nuntil the Senate issues its process. No unwilling witness has ever yet\r\nbeen compelled to testify; no process has gone out which should cross\r\nState lines. The Senate is now to determine, as the law of the present\r\ncase, and as the precedent for all future cases, as to the great crime\r\nof bribery--a crime which poisons the waters of republican liberty\r\nin the fountain--that the circumstances which here appear are not\r\nenough to demand its attention. It will hardly be doubted that cases\r\nof purchase of seats in the Senate will multiply rapidly under the\r\ndecision proposed by the majority of the committee.\"[572]\r\n\r\nThe debate upon the recommendation of the committee not to investigate\r\nwas impassioned. Senator Hoar said: \"The adoption of this majority\r\nreport ... will be the most unfortunate fact in the history of the\r\nSenate.\" When the vote of the Senate not to investigate was announced,\r\nSenator Edmunds turned to his neighbor in the Senate and summed up the\r\nverdict of posterity in these words: \"This is a day of infamy for the\r\nSenate of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe same Legislature which sent Senator Payne to the Senate defeated\r\nthe bill to allow the Cleveland independent refiners to build a pipe\r\nline to furnish themselves with oil. The defeat of the bill was\r\naccomplished by a lobby whose work was so openly shameless that it\r\nwas characterized by the Ohio press \"as an indelible disgrace to the\r\nState.\" The bill was one of many attempts which have been made by\r\nthe people of Ohio and Pennsylvania, without success, to get from\r\ntheir Legislature the right to build pipe lines. It has been tried to\r\nget laws to regulate the charges of the existing lines, but without\r\nsuccess. The history of the pipe-line bills in these legislatures\r\nfor the past ten years has been a monotonous record of an unavailing\r\nstruggle of a majority of millions to apply legal and constitutional\r\nrestraints to a minority of a few dozens. The means employed in the\r\nOhio Legislature of 1885 to defeat a bill giving equality in pipe-line\r\ntransportation to refiners in competition with the oil trust, which\r\nowned the existing pipe-lines, were of such a sort that that body has\r\ngone into the history of the State as the \"Coal-oil Legislature.\" It\r\nis stated by Hudson, in his _Railways and the Republic_, that the\r\nDemocratic agent of the bribery openly threatened to publish the list\r\nhe had of the members of the Legislature he had purchased, and that in\r\nconsequence of this threat proceedings which had been begun against him\r\nfor outraging the House by appearing on the floor in a state of gross\r\nintoxication were abandoned.[573]\r\n\r\nIn a debate about combinations in trade and industry--trusts--in the\r\nUnited States Senate in 1888, the sore scandal of this senatorial\r\nelection of 1884 was disinterred.\r\n\r\n\"If there be such a trust,\" said Senator Hoar, referring to the\r\noil trust, \"is it represented in the cabinet at this moment? Is it\r\nrepresented in the Senate? I want to know the facts about these five or\r\nsix great trusts which are sufficient in their power to overthrow any\r\ngovernment in Europe, if they existed in those nations, that should set\r\nitself against them--the coal, the sugar, the whiskey, the cotton, the\r\nfruit, the railroad transportation of this country, controlled by these\r\ngiant chieftains.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Payne defended the oil trust and himself. \"Even at this date,\"\r\nhe said, \"it seems that that company is represented as being guilty of\r\nall sorts of unlawful and improper things. Such allegations without\r\nproof to sustain them I regard as unworthy of an honorable man or an\r\nhonorable senator.... The Standard Oil Company,\" he continued, \"is a\r\nvery remarkable and wonderful institution. It has accomplished within\r\nthe last twenty years, as a commercial enterprise, what no other\r\ncompany or association of modern times has accomplished.\" He went on to\r\ndeclare that he \"never had a dollar's interest in the company.\" But the\r\ncharge which he and it would never allow to be investigated was that\r\nthe company had a great many dollars' interest in him. \"The majority of\r\nthe stockholders are very liberal in their philanthropic contributions\r\nto charity and benevolent works,\" he pleaded; \"but it contributed,\" he\r\nsaid, \"not one dollar or one cent directly or indirectly to my election\r\nto this body.\" During the demand for investigation he uttered no such\r\ndenial to be taken as a challenge.\r\n\r\nThe senator made what Senator Hoar properly called a \"very remarkable\r\nadmission\" concerning the part taken in elections by the oil\r\ncombination. \"When a candidate for the other House in 1871,\" Senator\r\nPayne said, \"no association, no combination in my district did more\r\nto bring about my defeat, and went to so large an expense in money to\r\naccomplish it, as the Standard Oil Company.\"\r\n\r\nThe oil trust, then, does take part in elections, and as a company\r\nspends larger sums of money than any other \"institution, association,\r\ncombination ... to accomplish the defeat\" of candidates for Congress!\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Payne said: \"There never has been a national election at which\r\nthose two gentlemen--one of them was my own son--have not contributed\r\nvery liberally.\" He named the two men who were, as Senator Hoar showed,\r\namong the most influential and important managers of his election to\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar closed the debate with these unanswered and unanswerable\r\nwords: \"A senator who, when the governor of his State, when both\r\nbranches of the Legislature of his State, complained to us that a\r\nseat in the United States Senate had been bought; when the other\r\nsenator from the State rose and told us that that was the belief of\r\na very large majority of the people of Ohio, without distinction of\r\nparty, failed to rise in his place and ask for the investigation which\r\nwould have put an end to those charges, if they had been unfounded,\r\nsheltering himself behind the technicalities which were found by some\r\ngentlemen on both sides of this chamber, that the investigation ought\r\nnot to be made, but who could have had it by the slightest request on\r\nhis part, and then remained dumb, I think should forever after hold his\r\npeace.\"[574]\r\n\r\nThe election of this senator was meant to be only the prelude to his\r\nnomination and election as President of the United States. This was\r\npublicly and authoritatively declared by the men who were charged with\r\nhaving spent money to buy the Legislature for him. One of these was\r\nthe proprietor of the most influential Democratic daily in Ohio, and\r\nthat journal in a leading editorial, double leaded to make it more\r\nprominent, declared this to be the purpose of Payne's friends. The New\r\nYork _Sun_ of May 27, 1884, followed, also in double-leaded editorials,\r\nunder the caption in staring black type of the name of the Senator,\r\nand said: \"Henry B. Payne is looming up grandly in the character of\r\na possible and not altogether improbable successor to Mr. Tilden as\r\nthe Democratic candidate for the Presidency. The fact that the Ohio\r\ndelegation at Chicago in July is sure to be solid for Payne is of\r\npeculiar importance and significancy. Everybody can see what it may\r\namount to.\"\r\n\r\nConcurrently with these formal announcements came the news from all\r\nparts of Ohio that the Payne party were hard at work to control the\r\nelection of the delegates who were to represent Ohio in the National\r\nDemocratic Convention at Chicago in July. But the managers of this\r\nPresidential campaign found that they had gone too far. The election\r\nfor senator had excited so fierce an anger over the whole country that\r\nit had become perfectly plain that Senator Payne was not \"available.\"\r\nThe education of the American public was still incomplete. It could see\r\nsenatorships bought and endure it, but the Presidency--\"not yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe use this senator made of his seat throws light where none is\r\nneeded. Again, in 1887, the great question of 1876 of the control of\r\nthe highways came up before Congress. The agitation of nearly twenty\r\nyears had come to a point. Thirty of the States and Territories of\r\nthe Union had established commissions or passed laws to regulate\r\nthe railroads. Congress had before it the Interstate Commerce bill\r\nforbidding discriminations, and creating the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission as a special tribunal to prevent and punish the crime. There\r\nhad been investigation, debates, amendments, meetings of conference\r\ncommittees of both Houses. It was proposed to \"recommit\" the bill to\r\nprevent its passage for an indefinite time. Mr. Payne voted \"Yes.\" Then\r\nthe question before the Senate is, Shall the bill become a law? Senator\r\nPayne's name is called. He votes:\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the same question as in 1876, and the same vote. Against the\r\ninvestigation, first, and then the legislation, his word is:\r\n\r\n\"I object.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nFOR \"OLD GLORY\" AND AN--APPROPRIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Congress passed the Postal Subsidy law for paying a higher than\r\nthe market rate of compensation to capitalists who would carry the\r\nmails in vessels built in America, of American materials, and manned by\r\nAmericans. No contracts were made by the Post-office Department under\r\nthe law for the mails between Europe and America, for there were no\r\nsuch capitalists and no such boats in that quarter.\r\n\r\nIn May of the next year, 1892, a bill was whizzed through Congress\r\nalmost without debate, in which the forms of the principal\r\nbeneficiaries-to-be of the law of 1891 loomed into view. The subsidy\r\nlaw gave its bonus only to vessels that could fly the American\r\nflag because American built and manned. This new act exempted from\r\nthese conditions the two principal steamers of the Inman, now\r\nthe International, line--the _City of New York_ and the _City of\r\nParis_--provided the company built two other steamers that fulfilled\r\nthe requirements of the subsidy law. The sequel disclosed that their\r\nowners had a well-laid plan to build more than two other steamers to\r\nget the rich rewards of the subsidy law. The steamers and the company\r\nwere not named. That was not needed. The bill was drawn with such\r\nlimitations as to size, speed, ownership, etc., that these were the\r\nonly two vessels which could come under its provisions. The bill was\r\nintroduced in the House by a prominent Democrat, and in the Senate by\r\na prominent Republican. It was passed by both Houses regardless of\r\nparty distinctions. The Secretary of the Navy urged the bill upon the\r\nnaval committees of Congress. He had begun to do so in his first report\r\nto Congress and subsequent communications, in which he referred by\r\nname to the vessels which were masked in this legislation. The head\r\nof the line and other owners were members of the oil combination.\r\nThe president of the steamship company has been the president of the\r\npipe-line branch of the oil trust--its largest single interest--from\r\nthe time of its organization in 1881.[575] This exemption from the\r\nlaw was engineered through the Senate by one who had hitherto always\r\nbeen conspicuously strenuous in refusing to abate his opposition to\r\nadmitting to American registry any ship not built in America, of\r\nAmerican materials, by American labor, but who now had suffered some\r\nsea change.\r\n\r\nOrdinary citizens who want to get the profits of carrying the American\r\nmails must build their boats in American ship-yards; but the syndicate\r\ngot members of Congress to grant them by law that which all others must\r\nearn.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of the Postal Subsidy law and the exemption of these\r\nsteamers by special law were the first two parts of a progressive\r\nprogramme. The third step was the negotiation of contracts with the\r\nPostmaster-General for the prizes of subsidy. Immediately upon the\r\npassage of this special legislation the Postmaster-General went through\r\nthe necessary but empty parade of advertising for bids for a service\r\nfor which there could be only one possible bidder. The awarding of\r\ncontracts to the steamship company so \"fortunate in competing\" was\r\nannounced in the press in October, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General dated the contracts 1895--three years ahead.\r\nThey run for ten years from that time. An iron-clad, or, better than\r\niron-clad, law-clad contract was thus secured, giving a complete\r\nmonopoly of the mail business between America and Europe until A.D.\r\n1905, five years into the twentieth century. The legislation of May\r\ncontemplated the construction of two new boats. The contracts secured\r\nfrom the Postmaster-General showed that the line intended to build\r\nfive, and obligated the government to pay subsidies to all of them, as\r\nwell as to the two foreign-built steamers given by special legislation\r\nthe right to fly the American flag. By these contracts the company,\r\nafter the completion of its new steamers in about three years, will\r\nexclusively carry every bag of mail that leaves America for Europe.\r\nMeanwhile the mails are to be given to its two steamers now running,\r\nthe _Paris_ and the _New York_, whenever they are in port. This has\r\nbeen frequently done in the past on account of their speed, but the\r\ncompensation for this, under the law and the new contracts, has been\r\nmade much greater than the price hitherto paid. With but one or two\r\nexceptions the mails on all the routes where subsidy is given--to South\r\nAmerica, Havana, China, Europe--were carried before the subsidy law\r\non the same ships as now. Except a very trifling saving in time, the\r\nonly change the law has made here is that the gains of the carriers\r\nhave been swelled at the cost of the taxpayers. The American shippers\r\ncarrying the mails at the regular weight rates were making a profit.\r\nThe Post-office, under the new deal, gets only what it has been\r\ngetting--the carriage of the mails; but the steamship company gets a\r\ngreat deal more. This is the \"pleasure of making it cheap\" applied to\r\nthe postal service.\r\n\r\nBy this procession of moves the company secured profitable contracts\r\nten years ahead on present ships, the _Paris_ and the _New\r\nYork_--although these had not yet done as much as fly the American\r\nflag in compliance with the special legislation in their behalf--and\r\non future ships that were not yet built or contracted for. All was in\r\nthe future--the American registry for the _Paris_ and the _New York_,\r\nthe building of the new steamers required by the special legislation.\r\nBut one thing was got in hand, and was not in the future tense--the\r\ncontract with the American Post-office, binding it to pay millions a\r\nyear. The privileges conferred by this legislation were so valuable\r\nthat, as Senator Frye stated in debate, its recipients to gain them\r\nwere to forfeit $105,000 due them from the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe American registry would be a capital advertisement to catch the\r\nAmerican tourist. Travelling, says Emerson, is a fool's paradise, and\r\nthe shifting population of that paradise would never stop to think\r\nout the fraud in the appeal to their patriotism. Much was made in the\r\nsentimental Senate of the privilege the law would give Americans of\r\ngoing abroad in their own ships under their own flag. The press was\r\nused shrewdly and widely to gain the favor of the public for these\r\nincursions into their Treasury. Pages of advertising, in the dress\r\nof news-matter, were put into prominent journals, telling in glowing\r\nphrases what a great thing Congress, the Postmaster-General, and the\r\nsteamship company were doing for the people. The same editorial on\r\nthe promised restoration of American maritime supremacy would appear\r\nas original in journals thousands of miles apart. As the panorama of\r\njournalism moved along with its daily shift any observer could see the\r\nmethodical and business-like way in which the syndicate \"inspired\"\r\nthe press. Articles about the \"great steamship line\" appeared on\r\nthe same date in the papers of different cities, giving the same\r\nfacts in the same order, and nearly the same words, following \"copy\"\r\nevidently supplied from a common source. One day these chimes all\r\nsing the immeasurable superiority of Southampton over Liverpool as\r\na port for Americans; another day the unspeakable sagacity of the\r\nPostmaster-General in giving this company the mails is the tune; and\r\nagain the ding-dong tells how, but for the syndicate and its subsidy,\r\nthe American flag--\"Old Glory\"--would be seen no more on the seas. The\r\naverage citizen who reads \"his\" paper is no doubt duly impressed.\r\n\r\n\"Old Glory on the seas!\" cried the excitable metropolitan editors. \"The\r\ndear old flag!\" \"America again Queen of the seas!\" \"A new era is about\r\nto dawn on our long-neglected commerce!\" Our long-absent flag is about\r\nto reappear, but not, as in the old days, as the symbol of a people's\r\ncommerce. It signalizes the commerce of syndicates. The democratic idea\r\nof a chance for all has been abandoned for the aristocratic idea of the\r\nfavored few. \"Poor indeed in spirit must be the American,\" said the\r\nNew York _Tribune_, \"who will not hail with satisfaction and pride the\r\nearly prospect of the reappearance of the flag in English, French, and\r\nBelgian ports.\" Poor, fortunately, it was replied, are many Americans\r\nin the spirit which taxes all the people out of an industry in which\r\nthey once led the world, and then taxes them to give that same industry\r\nas an exclusive privilege to a syndicate--and such a syndicate!\r\n\r\nThere was a rapturous chorus from the press because American materials\r\nand American labor are to be employed in the construction and use of\r\nthe new vessels to be built for subsidies. When American labor was free\r\nto employ itself and American materials with no subsidies, American\r\nboats did absolutely the whole packet business between England and\r\nAmerica.[576]\r\n\r\nNow American seamanship must remain content to be employed to such\r\nan extent and on such terms as may suit the interests of a few men,\r\nunder whose captainship the once glorious expansion of our commerce\r\non the seas is replaced by a system limited on every side. Limited by\r\nthe expensiveness of entering the occupation: a special bill has to\r\nbe passed through Congress in each case to confer the right to fly\r\nthe American flag on ships bought abroad, and for this the merely\r\nlegitimate expenses are heavy--trips to Washington, appearances before\r\ncommittees and departments, with expert representatives. Limited by\r\ntheir small number: instead of thousands building and running new\r\nships, a score. Limited by their capital: great, it is still much less\r\nthan the aggregate, if all had a chance. Limited by the narrowness of\r\nview and enterprise inevitable with a few, however capable: everybody\r\nknows more than anybody. Limited by the lack of diversity in opinion\r\nand interests: with many men of many minds, of varying forecasts and\r\nmoods and gaits, the currents of industry are kept fuller and steadier\r\nthan is possible under a clique rule. Limited by selfishness: the\r\nfew will inevitably come to regard the ocean-carrying business as\r\n\"belonging to us,\" like oil, and with their crushing wealth will treat\r\nas \"black-mailers\" intruders with new ships and new methods. Limited by\r\nthe impossibility the subsidy system imposes upon the average citizen\r\nof competing against the government--against himself multiplied by\r\nall his fellow-citizens. Limited by corruption: when this subsidy\r\nbill was under discussion, Representative Blount, of Georgia,[577]\r\ncalled attention to the methods by which previous legislation of the\r\nsame sort, \"to build up the American merchant marine and increase the\r\ncommerce of the country,\" had been sought from Congress. Quoting from\r\nthe report made to Congress in 1874-75 by Representative Kasson, of\r\nIowa, he showed that the Pacific Mail Company, to get a subsidy, had\r\ndisbursed $703,000 among the members and officers of Congress and other\r\npersons influential in legislation. \"Yankee maritime enterprise,\" this\r\nis called. The great captains, Bursley, Anthony, Delano, Dumaresq,\r\nComstock, Eldridge, Nye, Marshall, Holdredge, Morgan, and other sturdy\r\nAmericans who led the nautical world wherever speed, safety, and\r\ncourage were called for, outsailing competition even from the land\r\nwhere \"Blake and mighty Nelson fell\"[578]--they had a manlier idea\r\nof enterprise than being supported at the public expense in floating\r\npoor-houses miscalled floating hotels.\r\n\r\nThe few men who are the beneficiaries of taxes paid by the many will\r\nbe powerful and shrewd enough to get other dispensations or benefits,\r\npost-office contracts, naval contracts, or modifications of the strict\r\nterms of their agreement, and with this help from the taxpayer they can\r\ndo business at a figure which, though very remunerative to themselves,\r\nwill drive the unaided citizen competitor out of the business. Honest\r\ncitizens cannot ask for such favors. Poor men could not get them.\r\n\r\nIt was the old spirit of rebate which sought and gave the preference.\r\nNothing could make such legislation respectable but the extension of\r\nits benefits to all Americans owning such ships. But no such extension\r\nwas contemplated. The law gave a privilege not to the American flag,\r\nbut to the owners of the American flags of these two steamers. \"There\r\nis little probability,\" Senator Frye was reported as saying, December\r\n22, 1892, in the New York _Tribune_, friendly to him and to the policy\r\nof subsidy, \"of the passage of any more laws giving the privilege of\r\nan American registry to vessels upon the building of which no American\r\nlabor has been expended. The twin steamers _City of New York_ and _City\r\nof Paris_ have set a fashion of which they will be the only exponents.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a pool of the steamers between America and Europe called the\r\nNorth Atlantic Steamship Association. At its meeting in December,\r\n1892, this association discussed plans for reducing the number of\r\ntrips, increasing passenger rates, withdrawing excursion rates to\r\nthe World's Fair, and discontinuing the steerage traffic. This was\r\nduly followed by the announcement in March, 1893, for which it was\r\npresumably a preparation, that steerage traffic was renewed, but at\r\nan increase of rates. Passenger rates of the higher class have also\r\nbeen raised. Agreements to restrict the number of ships; pools to put\r\nup rates; steamship wars to destroy competitors; the use of \"pull\"\r\nto procure from the admiralty, sanitary, naval, immigration, and\r\nother governmental bureaus, here and abroad, regulations ostensibly\r\nfor public convenience, really to make business, as nearly as can\r\nbe, impossible for others; lobbies to buy legislation for private\r\ninterests--all these may be expected to replace the magnificent and\r\nmanly rivalries of the days when the unbribed flag floated on its own\r\nbreath in every sea.\r\n\r\nUnder the policy of subsidy--the policy of aristocracy, exclusion,\r\nscarcity, corruption, war, and loss of liberty--the contest for\r\nmaritime and commercial supremacy becomes a contest between the subsidy\r\nlobbies in Washington and at Westminster, Paris, and Berlin. If the\r\nduke who is at the head of one of the great English steamship lines\r\nobtains an increase of subsidy, the maritime dukes in America will\r\ncall on Congress not to shame itself by doing less for Americans than\r\nParliament has done for Englishmen. If all the English and American\r\nlines pass under one ducal yoke--following the internationalization\r\nof other syndicated businesses of Great Britain and America--one\r\nhidden hand will manage for one purse the make-believe duel between\r\nParliament and Congress, while the uninitiated people glare across the\r\nocean at each other, and each inspired press calls on its government\r\nnot to allow its commercial supremacy to be destroyed by vulgar and\r\nunpatriotic economy. In advocacy of subsidy--breeder of sea-dogs,\r\nnaval contractors, of war, and of treasury-suckled syndicates to fan\r\nits flames--the Secretary of the Navy wrote to the Chairman of the\r\nSenate Committee on Commerce in this case, \"A fleet of such cruisers\r\nwould sweep an enemy's commerce from the ocean.\" All through the press,\r\nfrom New York to Texas and the Pacific coast, every possible change of\r\nphrase is rung to fire the American heart with \"jingo\" exhortations to\r\nsubsidize private steamers so as to increase our fighting kennel.\r\n\r\nThe \"American idea\" is that individuals as well as corporations, poor\r\nmen as well as rich ones, small towns as well as large ones, one\r\nmaritime State as well as another, should be encouraged to follow the\r\nsea. The old woman who thanked God, upon her first sight of the sea,\r\nthat at last she had seen something there was enough of, lived before\r\nsubsidies were invented and the sea shrank to be too small for all the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe contracts made with the International Company bind the\r\ngovernment to pay it $4.00 a mile for fifty-two trips a year (3162\r\nmiles each) between New York and Southampton for the ten years\r\n(1895-1905)--$657,696 a year, and $6,576,960 for the ten years; and the\r\nsame rate a mile for the same number of trips a year (of 3350 miles\r\neach) between New York and Antwerp for ten years--$696,800 a year, and\r\n$6,968,000 for the ten years. This makes an income from the mails alone\r\nof $1,354,496 a year on the not-to-exceed $10,000,000 which the company\r\nwill have invested. At the end of the ten years it will have received\r\nfrom these government contracts alone its whole investment, and more\r\nthan one-third in addition. The American taxpayer will receive for his\r\nshare the profit and pleasure of being forbidden to send his letters\r\nto Europe by faster and cheaper boats, when these appear, as they have\r\nalready begun to do. The trial trips of new steamers of other lines\r\nshow them to be faster than the vessels we have bound ourselves to.\r\n\"The American principle\" used to be to send all mails by the fastest\r\nships. Now, to develop the \"American merchant marine,\" we relieve it\r\nfrom all necessity of competing in speed, or anything else, with the\r\nforeign marine.\r\n\r\nWith such legislation and contracts in hand, any syndicate could\r\ngo to the banks and borrow at the lowest rates every cent of the\r\nmillions it needed to carry out its plans. It need not invest a dollar\r\nof its own. Good enough \"collateral\" for borrowing would be this\r\nprivilege--practically a capital of millions got from the government\r\nfor nothing. Done for favored citizens, this is \"the development of our\r\nnational resources\"; done for the whole people, it would be \"socialism\"\r\nor something more dreadful. Thus guaranteed dividends by the forced\r\ncontributions of the American people, this company, if threatened with\r\ncompetition by other lines, old or new, can lower freights and fares\r\nto rates at which others cannot live. The subsidies are a reserve fund\r\non which it can subsist while doing other business below cost. The\r\nvision of this will deter other capitalists from building vessels, as\r\nthey have been frightened out of building tank-cars. The company can,\r\nby a war of rates, force the sale to it of such vessels as it wants\r\nout of the present Atlantic fleet. The scheme, which has progressed\r\nso smoothly through the various stages of the Postal Subsidy law--the\r\nexemption by special legislation of the two steamers from their foreign\r\ndisabilities, the negotiation of the contracts for subsidies until A.D.\r\n1905 for steamers yet unborn--is an entering wedge, the broad end of\r\nwhich may easily grow to be a monopoly of the transatlantic--and why\r\nnot transpacific?--traffic and travel.\r\n\r\nAnd in future legislation, tariffs, and contracts, what bulwark\r\nof the people would avail against the Washington lobby of these\r\ncombined syndicates of oil, natural gas, illuminating gas, coal,\r\nlead, linseed-oil, railroads, street-railroads, banks, ocean and\r\nlake steamships and whalebacks, iron and copper mines, steel mills,\r\netc.? These beggars on horseback--the poor we will always have with\r\nus as long as we give such alms--are forever at the elbows of the\r\nsecretaries, representatives, senators. The people who pay are at work\r\nin their fields, out of sight, scattered over thousands of miles.\r\n\r\nHaving evaded, by the complaisance of Congress, the requirements of\r\nthe subsidy law in the case of its two non-American steamers, the\r\ncompany sought to be relieved by the Secretary of the Treasury from the\r\nnecessity of manning its boats with Americans, as stipulated by the\r\nlaw. It was unwilling to sacrifice the foreign captains in its employ,\r\nas the despatches said, \"for the untried men of American citizenship,\"\r\nregardless that one of the strongest promises of the subsidy givers\r\nand takers was to recall to the sea the American citizenship banished\r\nthence. The company had already driven its foreign-built boats through\r\nthe law, why not its foreign captains? It applied to the Treasury\r\nDepartment for permission to retain them. To furnish a ground for such\r\na ruling, the foreign captains had given notice of their \"intention\"\r\nto become citizens. They could not become citizens for five years, and\r\nthe courts hold that such a declaration does not meet the requirements\r\nof the law that the officers of United States vessels shall be citizens\r\nof the United States. The ruling asked for was refused by Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Treasury Nettleton. The question was not dropped.\r\nSome months later (December 2, 1892) the Washington despatches of\r\nthe Philadelphia _Ledger_ and the New York _Herald_ reported that\r\n\"Secretary Foster of the Treasury is disposed to accede to the wishes\r\nof the company, if it can possibly be done within the law,\" and in the\r\nNew York _Tribune_ we read that \"he is inclined to the view that an\r\nexception might safely be made in this case.\"\r\n\r\nThe raising of the American flag on these steamers--one at New York\r\nand the other at Southampton--in the spring of 1893, was made a state\r\nceremony in both countries. The President of the United States came on\r\nspecially from the capital to honor the occasion, though this had never\r\nbeen done before when the American flag was raised on vessels admitted\r\nto foreign registry. The American minister left the embassy at London\r\nto officiate at Southampton. The vessels were announced to be under\r\nAmerican captains transferred from other ships owned by the same men.\r\nBut the Society of American Marine Engineers and the Brotherhood of\r\nSteamboat Pilots discovered that other officers--the foreign engineers\r\nof the vessels--had been retained, though they were foreigners. The\r\nformer began an agitation for the protection of their legal rights.\r\nRemonstrances from every important branch of the two societies from San\r\nFrancisco to New York were forwarded to the President of the United\r\nStates and the Secretary of the Treasury of the new administration\r\nwhich had just gone into office. Counsel were employed to present\r\ntheir case. It was found that one of the last official acts of the\r\nout-going Secretary of the Treasury had been the order authorizing the\r\nissue of licenses to foreign engineers. Attempts to procure a copy\r\nof this order from the department have failed. Engineers have always\r\nbeen considered to be officers. If they are such, this exemption was\r\na violation of the statutes of the United States which require that\r\nofficers shall be American. It reversed all the decisions which hold\r\nthat declaration of an intention to become a citizen does not make one\r\nlegally a citizen, for that would give foreigners, as in this case, the\r\nadvantages of citizenship without its duties; and indefinitely, for the\r\nintention might never be executed. The order of the Secretary makes a\r\nprecedent upon which foreign captains may be employed--the objection\r\nbeing the same in either case--and their reappearance may therefore\r\nbe confidently looked for. The appropriation once got, \"Old Glory\" is\r\nhauled down.\r\n\r\nAn \"American Seaman\" wrote the New York _World_ that when he offered\r\nhimself for employment on the boat which had just replaced with so much\r\npomp the British flag with the American he was almost laughed at, and\r\nwas told there had been ninety men on board that morning on the same\r\nerrand. All got the same answer, \"We don't want you. We employ all\r\nour hands on the other side.\" The articles circulated throughout the\r\ncountry to create public opinion in favor of these subsidies dwell much\r\non the \"glory\" and advantage of having Americans in command of these\r\nvessels with a full American force under them. But the subsidy secured,\r\nwe see these American vessels, which may be called upon to take part in\r\na war with Great Britain, are manned by British engineers and British\r\nseamen. The lower compensation they are accustomed to will help keep\r\ndown the cost of manning the other vessels to be built for the line.\r\n\r\nThe secretary by whom this was done was he who, as president of a\r\nsubordinate corporation of the oil combination, had been the commanding\r\nofficer at the front in the great battle with Toledo.[579] When he\r\nwas nominated for Secretary of the Treasury, Senator Payne made\r\nhimself conspicuous by soliciting support among the Democrats for the\r\nconfirmation of this Republican. \"He could not be chosen to the Toledo\r\nCouncil from any ward to-day,\" said the New York _Times_, February\r\n23, 1891, \"so bitter is the feeling against him,\" and the same paper\r\ndeclared that his defeat in Ohio as a candidate for Congress in 1890\r\nwas entirely due to his connection with the oil combination. But though\r\nof so little political power that he could not command a majority of\r\nthe votes in his own Congressional district, there was influence behind\r\nhim which could get the head of his party and the government to put\r\nhim in the seat illustrious with the memory of such men as Alexander\r\nHamilton and Salmon P. Chase. \"The objection to Governor Foster as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, that he was an associate in business of the\r\nmembers of the great oil trust,\" said the New York _Press_, \"President\r\nHarrison did not regard as serious enough to have any weight.\" It\r\nwas pointed out by the Buffalo _Courier_ editorially, February 23,\r\n1891, and other papers, that the oil trust, which Mr. Foster had been\r\nserving, \"is not only a heavy exporter but a heavy importer, especially\r\nof tin plate, and is an extensive claimant for rebates of duty on the\r\ntin of cans in which oil is exported.\"\r\n\r\nAn item of Associated Press news in December, 1892, says that the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury has just decided that the oil combination\r\nshall be paid by the Treasury a drawback of the duties it has paid on\r\nimported steel hoops for barrels in which it exports oil. \"It isn't\r\npleasant,\" said the New York _World_, editorially, February 23, 1891,\r\n\"to have a Secretary of the Treasury who holds intimate relations\r\nwith the oil trust.\" It is through the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nthat the company receives the mail subsidies of millions a year. All\r\nthe statistics and official publications with regard to the \"decline\r\nof American shipping\" and \"foreign competition with American oil,\"\r\nand about the tariff, as on oil, coal, steel, tin, etc., and many\r\nother financial and commercial matters of pecuniary concern to them,\r\nare under the charge of the Secretary of the Treasury. The Treasury\r\nDepartment's Commissioner of Navigation, in 1892, sends circulars to\r\nthe boards of trade and chambers of commerce all over the country,\r\ncalling attention to the small amount of money paid by our government\r\nto American steamers for the mails, and advocating the establishment of\r\na merchant marine and naval reserve on the principle adopted by Great\r\nBritain--_i.e._, the payment of subsidies.\r\n\r\nWhen Senator Hoar, speaking of the oil combination in the debate on\r\nthe Payne case,[580] asked, sharply: \"Is it represented in the Cabinet\r\nat this moment?\" he referred to the Secretary of the Navy. Subsidy had\r\nnot then insinuated itself into the policy of the government; but when\r\nthat came, the uses of a Secretary of the Navy were clear enough. It\r\nwas by the influence of the Secretary of the Navy that the subsidies\r\nfor these steamships of the oil trust were got through Congress. It\r\nis the Secretary of the Navy who passes upon the speed of the ships\r\nreceiving subsidies; and his findings are binding upon the Post-office\r\nDepartment which awards the contracts and upon the Treasury Department\r\nwhich pays. In the rush of the closing hours of the session of 1889-90\r\nof the Fifty-first Congress, upon the urgent recommendation, made in\r\nperson to the Naval Committee, of the same Secretary of the Navy who\r\nhad pushed through the subsidy special legislation we have described,\r\n$1,000,000 was appropriated for the purchase of nickel ore. It is an\r\nemergency, said the senator who spoke for the Naval Committee to the\r\nSenate. The nickel was to be bought by the Secretary of the Navy; when\r\nand where was at his discretion. The ore was to be used for alloying\r\nsteel in the manufacture of armor plate. The same Congress took off the\r\nduty of hundreds of dollars a ton on nickel imported. The only nickel\r\nmine of importance in America was then at Sudbury, Canada. In pressing\r\nthe appropriation through Congress it was stated that the mine, like\r\nthe steamship company subsidized later, was owned by \"our citizens.\"\r\nAfter investigation in Cleveland, New York, Washington, and Canada, the\r\n_Daily News_ of Chicago declared that the appropriation of $1,000,000\r\nand the abolition of the duty were done in the interest of members of\r\nthe oil combination; that they were \"our citizens\" who were the owners\r\nof the nickel mine at Sudbury; that they had sent an able lobbyist to\r\nWashington to secure the legislation; and that, in anticipation of his\r\nsuccess, the product of the mine had been withheld for a year from\r\nthe market, until ore to the value of millions had accumulated. It\r\nwas said that by April 1, 1890, there were 5000 tons on the dump, the\r\nduty on which, at the old rate, would have been $1,500,000. Whether\r\nthese statements were correct or not--and in the absence of official\r\ninvestigation it is impossible to tell--the narrative answers fully\r\nthe purpose of giving the uninitiated public an idea of the relations\r\nthat may exist between public departments and private syndicates with\r\ngreat profit--but not to the department. The appropriation was passed\r\nSeptember 29, 1890. The books of the Navy Department show that the\r\nSecretary thereupon made contracts with the Canadian Copper Company, by\r\nwhich, up to June 15th following, it sold the government $321,321.86\r\nworth of nickel. A litigation arising among its stockholders in the\r\nspring of 1893 disclosed among them no less close a connection of the\r\noil trust than the senator from Ohio who had served it in Congress from\r\n1876 to 1891.\r\n\r\nThe message of a Republican President in 1892 commended the special\r\nlegislation in favor of the two steamers, and urged Congress not to\r\nfail to appropriate money to pay them their subsidies. The Democratic\r\nPostmaster-General, who now stands between the United States and these\r\ncarriers of the foreign mails, is one of the firm of distinguished\r\ncounsel who defended the interests of some of the owners of this\r\nsteamship line in the conspiracy trial at Buffalo.[581] He is to\r\ngive them the vouchers upon which the millions a year of subsidies\r\nare to be paid, and he may be called upon to consider new contracts.\r\nIn the Presidential campaign of 1892 the head of the oil trust was\r\nprominent on one side figuring among the officers of great political\r\nmass-meetings in New York, while the associate referred to by Senator\r\nHoar was the active manager of the political fortunes of the other\r\nparty. This is not a solitary instance. The great man who testified\r\ntwenty-one years ago that he was a Republican in Republican districts,\r\na Democrat in Democratic districts, but everywhere an Erie man, has now\r\nan army of imitators. The people had this authoritatively explained to\r\nthem while they were dazedly watching the speculation in sugar-trust\r\nstock in Wall Street and the Senate rise and fall with the manipulation\r\nof the sugar tariff in committee. The president of the sugar-trust,\r\nbefore a special committee of the United States Senate, testified\r\nthat this \"politics of business\" was the custom of \"every individual\r\nand corporation and firm, trust, or whatever you call it.\"[582] Asked\r\nif he contributed to the State campaign funds, he said: \"We always\r\ndo that.... In the State of New York, where the Democratic majority\r\nis between 40,000 and 50,000, we throw it their way. In the State of\r\nMassachusetts, where the Republican party is doubtful, they probably\r\nhave the call.... Wherever there is a dominant party, wherever the\r\nmajority is very large, that is the party that gets the contribution,\r\nbecause that is the party which controls the local matters\"--which\r\ninclude the elections to Congress and the Presidential election.[583]\r\nFederal judges find the sugar trust not subject to the anti-trust\r\nlaw.[584] The Attorney-General has not got decisions in the suits\r\nagainst it for refusal to answer Census questions. Congress forces\r\nthe people to buy sugar of it only, and at its price. The Secretary\r\nof the Treasury drafts for a committee of Congress a tariff like that\r\nthe trust needs. Our President is the head of the \"dominant party that\r\ngets the contribution,\" and he joins the sugar lobby by recommending,\r\nunofficially, legislation in its favor.[585]\r\n\r\nBy what law gives it, and by what law does not take from it, the sugar\r\ntrust can issue $85,000,000 of securities on $10,000,000 of property,\r\nand collect $28,000,000[586] a year of profits. Control of government,\r\nwith its Presidents, Congress, Federal Judges, Attorney-Generals,\r\nand Cabinet Secretaries, would be a great prize. Probably none of\r\nthe trust's \"raw material\" would be so cheaply bought as this if it\r\ncould be purchased by campaign contributions of a few hundred thousand\r\ndollars. In an interview in the New York _Herald_ of March 25, 1894,\r\nthe debonair president of the trust, to shame the objections of\r\npicayune souls, cries, \"Who cares for a quarter of a cent a pound?\" The\r\nanswer is not far to seek. He does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\"THE COMMODITY IS NOT SO GOOD AS BEFORE\"\r\n\r\n --_Lord Coke._\r\n\r\n\r\nThree hundred years ago Lord Coke, in the \"Case of the\r\nMonopolies,\"[587] declared these to be the inevitable result of\r\nmonopoly: the price of the commodity will be raised; the commodity is\r\nnot so good as before; it tends to the impoverishment of artisans,\r\nartificers, and others.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 and 1879, when railway presidents were saying \"No\" to every\r\napplication of the few remaining independents for passage along the\r\nroad to market,[588] and the oil combination was supreme from the\r\nwell to the lamp, a concerted protest was made against its oil by\r\ncommercial bodies representing trade all over Europe. An international\r\ncongress was held specially to consider means for the protection of the\r\nEuropean consumer, by the interposition of the governments of Europe\r\nand America, or by commercial measures. In the archives of the State\r\nDepartment at Washington are the documents in which this episode can be\r\nread.[589] At this moment of triumph over all rivals, \"even what was\r\nclassed as superior brands was a poor article.\"[590] The English trade\r\nmet in London, in January, 1879, and remonstrated. One of the delegates\r\nstated that a small dealer who bought of him had written, threatening\r\nto commit suicide on account of the trouble this poor oil was giving\r\nhim.[591] The American consul at Antwerp, under date of February 19,\r\n1879, called the attention of the State Department to the congress\r\nabout to be held to consider the serious complaints which had been made\r\nof late against American refined petroleums. He gave the warning that\r\nunless there was an improvement the Belgian government would interfere\r\nfor the protection of the people with regulations which would greatly\r\nembarrass the export trade from America. A bill was introduced into the\r\nGerman Reichstag to protect the people of Germany against the flood of\r\nbad oil from America. Against those dealing in oil dangerous to human\r\nsafety it provided penalties from fines to loss of citizenship and\r\npenal servitude.\r\n\r\nAt the congress which met at Bremen in February were represented all\r\nthe European nations of any importance except France, which imports\r\nonly crude, and does all its refining at home. It was an indignation\r\nmeeting. The consul at Bremen wrote the State Department, under date\r\nof February 27, 1879, an account of it. It was \"very important,\"\r\nhe said. \"Delegates were present from the chambers of commerce of\r\nAntwerp, Amsterdam, Berlin, Breslau, Christiania, Copenhagen, Danzig,\r\nFrankfort-on-Main, Hamburg, Königsberg, Lubeck, Mannheim, Nürnberg,\r\nRostock, Rotterdam, Stettin, Trieste, Moscow, and Vienna.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"united refiners,\" to explain away the faults of their oil, sent\r\na representative to the congress who was one of the inspectors of the\r\nState of New York, in the pay of the people, but using his official\r\nprestige in behalf of a private interest. The consul at Bremen names\r\nthe two chief points made in the defence: First, that the refined oil\r\nwas bad because half the crude then produced in America was from the\r\nBradford field, \"and is so different in quality from the so-called\r\nParker oil that the same quality of refined oil cannot be made--at\r\nany rate, by the ordinary processes hitherto in use.\" Second, that\r\nthe wicks in common use were poor. That the inferior quality of the\r\nBradford oil was not the real reason was proved by the fact that\r\nthe refined oil manufactured and exported by the refineries of the\r\ncombination from the crude of the other fields deteriorated at the same\r\ntime and as much.[592] The Bremen congress knew this. It was at this\r\nprecise moment--though this the Bremen congress did not know--that the\r\ncombination was tying up a great inventor and hauling his apparatus to\r\nthe junk-yard to prevent the test of a new method for making better\r\nand cheaper oil.[593] Its members would have had the benefit of it if\r\nsuccessful, but with the spirit which men who seek exclusive control\r\nalways exhibit, they did not want to change.\r\n\r\nThe congress declined to treat with any respect the excuses that were\r\noffered. It declared \"that the complaints regarding the inferior\r\nquality of much of the petroleum recently received from America, and\r\nespecially of the different brands of the\" oil combination, were \"fully\r\njustified.\" It consequently demanded from the American refiners, and\r\nespecially from the oil combination, \"First, that they give greater\r\ncare to the refining of crude oil than they have recently done, in\r\norder that the petroleum may in the future be again as free as it\r\nformerly was from acids and heavy oils, that inferior qualities may no\r\nlonger be shipped to Europe, and that the consumer may again receive\r\nthe former customary good quality.\"\r\n\r\nThe superiority of its barrels was specially mentioned by the head\r\nof the oil combination to explain why all competitors failed. \"All\r\nits advantages,\" he said in court in Cleveland, \"are legitimate\r\nbusiness advantages, due to the very large volume of supplies which\r\nit purchases, its long continuance in the business, the experience it\r\nhas thereby acquired, the knowledge of all the avenues of trade, the\r\nskill of experienced employés, the possession and use of all the latest\r\nand most valuable mechanical improvements, appliances, and processes\r\nfor the distillation of crude oil, and in the manufacture of its own\r\nbarrels, glue, etc., by reason of which it is enabled to put the oil on\r\nthe market at a cost of manufacture much less than by others not having\r\nequal advantages.\" But the Bremen congress made a special attack on the\r\n\"barrels\" and \"glue.\" It complained that \"the continental petroleum\r\ntrade has suffered heavy losses on account of inferior barrels,\"\r\nand demanded that the oil combination should \"only use barrels of\r\nwell-seasoned, air-dried, split (not sawed) white oak staves and\r\nheads.\" It even particularized that the barrels should be \"painted with\r\nblue linseed-oil paint, and supplied with double, strong head-hoops,\"\r\nand \"more carefully glued, and not filled until the glue is thoroughly\r\ndry.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were substantially without competition,\" was said in explanation\r\nof the poor quality of the product sent to Europe, and also \"to all\r\nparts of this country. The quality of the oil which they sent was not\r\na matter of first-class importance for them to retain their business.\"\r\nIt was \"a negligence which came in a great measure from the absence of\r\ncompetition.\" This witness was asked by the lawyer of the combination\r\nif he meant the committee to understand that it \"was committing suicide\r\nby furnishing a continuously deteriorating article of oil to the\r\nconsumer.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were not committing suicide, because they had the business in\r\ntheir own hands almost exclusively at that time.\"[594]\r\n\r\nThis was in 1879, and the complaints of the quality of American oil\r\nsent abroad continue to this day. Export oil, the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission say, in 1892, \"is an inferior oil.\"[595]\r\n\r\nOne of the means by which a market was found for American oil in\r\nScotland was the lowering of the British requirements in 1879 as to\r\nquality, from a flash-test of 100° to one of 73°, so that the more\r\nexplosive American oil, until then debarred, could be legally sold\r\nto the people of Great Britain. The oil made in Scotland was \"a very\r\nsuperior article--very good indeed.\"[596] There were two ways of\r\ngetting the market: to meet the Scotch manufacturer with as good an\r\noil, or to induce the government to permit the sale of something\r\ninferior. The latter policy was adopted. The government was induced\r\nto permit the sale to private consumers of oil that would give off\r\nan inflammable gas at a temperature of 73°--a lower temperature than\r\noften exists in living-rooms. Meanwhile the government continued to\r\ninsist upon oil that would stand a test of 105° for its own use in the\r\nnavy and 145° in its light-houses. The absurdity of this legal test\r\nwas proved by Mr. T. Graham Young, son of Mr. James Young, founder of\r\nthe Scotch oil industry, in a letter to the Glasgow _Herald_ of May\r\n12, 1894. He showed by the records that the year before there had been\r\nsixty days in London in which the temperature had gone above 73°. The\r\ngovernment, that is, gave its sanction to the sale of oil which might\r\nexplode at a heat below that ordinarily reached in an English summer!\r\nCommenting on the strange fact that the Scotch oil companies did not\r\nmove against the change of test which had put them and the British\r\nconsumer at the mercy of this explosive American oil, Mr. Young said:\r\n\"It is generally understood that they are precluded from doing so by an\r\nagreement with the foreign producers. I hold a letter from one of the\r\ninterested parties ... stating that for the above reason he could not\r\ndiscuss the matter.\" In discussing this matter, the Glasgow _Herald_\r\nnotes that even patient and poverty-struck India complains of the \"very\r\npoor quality\" of the oil sent there.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch papers are continually printing indignant comments on this\r\naction of the British government, and wondering inquiries as to the\r\ninfluence by which so injurious a change in the regulations for public\r\nprotection could have been effected. The Scotch manufacturers are\r\ncontinually agitating to have the coroners in England and Ireland, and\r\nthe procurators-fiscal in Scotland, make particular inquiry in all\r\ncases of fatal lamp explosions into the flash-point of the oil and its\r\norigin--whether American or Scotch. At the December, 1892, meeting of\r\nthe Society of Chemical Industry of Great Britain it was declared that\r\nabout three hundred deaths a year occurred in England and Wales from\r\nlamp accidents, due to the explosiveness of the American oil sold\r\nunder this reduction of the test.\r\n\r\nThe agitation against this dangerous oil has been increasing in Great\r\nBritain year by year. The subject has been investigated by the Glasgow\r\nChamber of Commerce, which found that many serious accidents to life\r\nand property had resulted from the use of this oil, and at its meeting\r\nof May 14, 1894, the chamber voted to petition the government to raise\r\nthe test again to 100°. The Manchester and Edinburgh chambers of\r\ncommerce took similar action. A number of other bodies have taken the\r\nsubject up, and the government has had to promise to make an inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe statistics show that last year nearly one in five (19.3 per cent.)\r\nof the fires in London and more than one in eight (13.24 per cent.)\r\nof the fires in Liverpool came from kerosene. The oil used in those\r\ncities is principally the cheap American article sold under the lowered\r\ntest of the English law. But in Glasgow, where most of the oil burned\r\nis that of the Scotch manufacturers, who, by agreement, sell no lower\r\nquality than 100° test, the number of fires from kerosene is less than\r\ntwo in a hundred (1.7 per cent.). At a meeting of representatives of\r\nthe leading insurance companies of Edinburgh and Glasgow, June 20,\r\n1894, experiments were made with the American, Russian, and Scotch\r\noils. The American was found to be the most explosive, and some of\r\nit flashed at 69°. A lighted match thrown into this oil heated to\r\n88° started an instantaneous blaze; thrown into Scotch oil it was\r\nextinguished. Experts testified that the cost of making the oil safe\r\nwould be about a farthing a gallon, and that if the Americans, whose\r\n\"self-interest\" and \"private enterprise\" are not equal to a voluntary\r\neffort, were compelled by law to furnish a better illuminant, their\r\nprofits would be greater, not less.\r\n\r\nA rich field for investigation is concealed beneath the elaborate\r\nsystem of State inspection, by which the people have sought to protect\r\nthemselves from being tempted by deceptive prices to buy a sure death.\r\nWe have seen in several places how the State inspectors are in the\r\nemploy, at the same time, of the State and the seller, whom it is\r\ntheir duty to watch for the State.[597] Evidence abounds at every turn\r\nof the use of inspectors and inspection laws to embarrass and even\r\nsuppress the smaller refiners. One of the latest instances is a new\r\nlaw in Tennessee, which puts special difficulties in the way of oil\r\nreaching the State by river, the avenue to which independent refiners\r\nare forced by the discriminations of the railroad. We saw an inspector\r\nof the State of New York appear at the Bremen congress as the avowed\r\nrepresentative of the \"united refineries,\" complaints of whose bad oils\r\noccasioned the congress.\r\n\r\nBy one of those coincidences in which the world of cause and effect\r\nabounds, the Fire Marshal of Boston, in the same year in which Joshua\r\nMerrill described his fruitless efforts to continue the manufacture of\r\na first-class oil,[598] found it necessary to warn the people against\r\nthe dangerous stuff they were burning in their lamps. In his report in\r\n1888 he called attention to the fact that one-tenth, nearly, of all the\r\nfires in Boston the preceding year had been caused by the explosion of\r\nkerosene or by its accidental combustion. He got samples of the oil\r\nused in a number of the places where fires had occurred from explosion,\r\nand had them analyzed by professors of the Institute of Technology in\r\nBoston and of the School of Mines of Columbia College in New York. They\r\nfound them to be below the quality required by the State. Singularly\r\nenough, one of the State oil inspectors, examining similar samples,\r\ndeclared them to be above the standard of the State. The Boston\r\n_Herald_, discussing the matter, pointed out that the oil inspectors\r\nwere paid by the owner of the oil. This, it said, placed inspectors\r\npractically under the oil combination, which has ways, it continued, of\r\nmaking things unpleasant for inspectors who make reports unsatisfactory\r\nto it. The fire marshal's conclusion in all the cases he investigated\r\nof these fires by explosion was: \"I have felt warranted in every\r\ninstance in attributing the blame to the inferior quality of kerosene\r\nused.\"[599]\r\n\r\nThe European protest of 1879 followed close upon the success of the\r\ncomprehensive campaign of 1878[600] \"to overcome competition.\" The\r\nwarning from the Fire Marshal of Boston in 1888 and the success of the\r\nmovement, begun in 1885,[601] to shut the independents of Oil City and\r\nTitusville out of Boston and New England came close together. These are\r\nnot coincidences merely. They are cause and effect.\r\n\r\nIt is known that a practice has grown up among the oil inspectors\r\nof the States of allowing certain refiners to brand their own oil\r\nas they please, or letting it go to market unbranded. This permits\r\nthe sale of unbranded and therefore illicit and presumably dangerous\r\noil. Charges that inspectors in Iowa loaned their stencils to the oil\r\ncombination to do its own branding were made formally in writing, in\r\n1890, by one of the deputy inspectors, in the form required by law,\r\nto the governor of the State. The law provides that charges so made\r\nshall be investigated by the governor. No investigation was made,\r\nbut the inspector was removed just as he was about to lay before a\r\ngrand-jury documentary evidence of this and other violations of the\r\nlaw. This inspector declared publicly that inspectors were in the\r\nhabit of leaving their official stencils with companies in the oil\r\ncombination, and allowing them to put any brand they chose on any oil.\r\nHe refused to continue this practice, nor would he brand barrels until\r\nthey were filled. The representative of the combination in that State\r\nused every device except force, the inspector says, to induce him to\r\nconform to the practice. \"Don't you know,\" this representative said,\r\n\"that if you leave us your brand and get into trouble you will have\r\nthe oil combination back of you? You will be taken care of.\" In his\r\nformal complaint to the governor, this inspector declared that this\r\nrepresentative said in substance to him: \"You are the only fool among\r\nthe inspectors. We have the stencils of the inspectors at every other\r\npoint where we want them.\"\r\n\r\nThe law put upon the governor the duty to investigate upon receiving\r\nwritten complaint. But when written complaint was formally made, and\r\nthat not by an ordinary citizen, but by one of the sworn officials of\r\nthe State, the governor demanded that the inspector back up his charges\r\nwith the affidavits of witnesses--that is, the governor demanded that\r\nthe inspector, who had no power, should make the investigation. This\r\nput an end to the whole matter. The inspector could not make the\r\ninvestigation, and the governor would not. The same governor refused\r\nto allow the written charges to be seen, although they are public\r\ndocuments, and they remained invisible as long as he held office.\r\nOnly a few weeks after the removal of this inspector, the State oil\r\ninspector was sued for heavy damages by the owner of a barn which had\r\nbeen burned down through the explosion of bad oil. The ground of the\r\nsuit was that the inspector, having failed to inspect and condemn this\r\noil, as he should have done, was liable on his bond to the State. The\r\npress of Iowa commented freely on the probable connection between\r\ndestructive fires, like this one, and the custom of allowing the oil\r\nring to inspect itself, by which it was given the opportunity to put\r\ninferior and dangerous oils on the market with the brand of the State\r\non them as good. As far as the case has been carried, up to date, the\r\nIowa courts have sustained the claim and held the inspector in damages.\r\n\r\nThat which is an uninvestigated charge in Iowa is an officially\r\nascertained fact in Minnesota. The demonstration in the latter case\r\namounts practically to confirmation for the former, since the parties\r\nin interest, the motive, and the opportunity are identical. An\r\ninvestigation was made of the conduct of the State oil inspector by the\r\nCommittee on Illuminating Oils of the Minnesota Senate, in 1891. The\r\ncommittee say in their report, which was adopted by the Senate:\r\n\r\n\"The testimony further shows that stencils were left with different\r\noil companies by the State inspector or his deputy, by which the\r\ncompanies caused their barrels containing oil to be branded by their\r\nown employés, without the supervision of any State official. It appears\r\nthat after the arrangement for the payment of the inspectors' and\r\ndeputies' salaries by the oil companies was made, the attitude of the\r\ninspector towards his duties may be summed up in a few words of his\r\ntestimony: 'I am under no obligation to the State of Minnesota. The\r\nStandard Oil Company paid me.'\"[602]\r\n\r\nThe methods covered by the general phrases of the Minnesota Senate\r\nCommittee were described in detail by a \"commissioner\" of the Omaha\r\n_Daily Bee_, which found the same things being done in Nebraska. The\r\n_Bee_ in 1891 made an elaborate investigation of the manner in which\r\nthe oil inspection of Nebraska was executed. Its reporter passed\r\nincognito by the guardians of the portals of the warehouse of companies\r\nbelonging to the oil trust in Omaha, and stood by while barrels were\r\nfilled with uninspected oil and loaded on the cars for shipment to\r\nvarious points. That the people who bought the oil might know their\r\nlives were safe, each barrel bore the brand of approval provided by\r\nlaw, as follows:\r\n\r\n Approved. Flash Test 105°\r\n\r\n         ...........................\r\n             _State Inspector of Nebraska_.\r\n\r\n         By ........................\r\n                                  _Deputy_.\r\n\r\nBut there was no inspector present, and the barrels were all branded\r\nbeforehand and while empty, in defiance of the law and public safety.\r\nThe reporter stayed until the cars were loaded, the doors closed,\r\nand saw the trains pull out. It is from this warehouse that the\r\ngreater part of the barrelled oil consumed in Nebraska is forwarded.\r\nAt the warehouse of the same company in Nebraska City the reporter\r\nfound the same thing going on, and there, too, he found the official\r\nstencil-plates of several of the State oil inspectors lying at hand\r\non the tanks, waiting to be used at the pleasure of the employés of\r\nthe company to brand the desired government guarantee on any oil,\r\nregardless of what it was. The Illinois _State Journal_ found the same\r\npractice permitted in Springfield by the oil inspector in February,\r\n1894. The _Bee_ reporter describes how tanks, once branded, came and\r\nwent, were filled and emptied and filled again for months, with no\r\ninspection of the oil in them. Often the tanks were not even branded.\r\n\r\nThe Omaha _Daily Bee_ of November 24, 1891, gives a careful analysis\r\nof the recently amended inspection law of Nebraska. It shows that in\r\nmany important points the law has been changed so as to put the safety\r\nof the people in the power of the combination which supplies almost\r\nall the oil used in the State. The standard required has been lowered.\r\nThe liability to a charge of manslaughter for death resulting from bad\r\noil has been changed to a liability for damages. The method of making\r\nthe tests has been changed for the worse. No provision has been made\r\nfor the protection of travellers by the inspection of oil used by\r\nthe railroads, although accidents and serious ones, from the use of\r\ndangerous oil were frequent in the trains and at stations.[603] The\r\n_Bee_ said editorially of the oil combination that it had \"managed, by\r\nits shrewdness in enacting this law, to make Nebraska the refuse tank\r\nfor its rejected Eastern oil, and at the same time to crowd out of the\r\nState about all opposition.\" By means of this lowering of the test, oil\r\nthat was too poor to pass in Iowa could be sent on to Nebraska and sold\r\nthere. The _Bee_ gives instances where this was done.\r\n\r\nThe _Bee_ continued its investigations in 1893. It declared, December\r\n5, 1893, that the inspection law, imperfect at best, was \"being still\r\nfurther annulled by the open defiance of the leading oil companies.\" It\r\ndeclared \"the leading violator\" to be one of the principal companies\r\nin the oil combination. In a later issue the _Bee_ printed the result\r\nof tests made for it of oils purchased in the principal towns of\r\nthe State. In almost every such case these showed that oils which\r\nwere below the test were being sold to the people as good under the\r\nguarantee of the State. Some of them were \"as safe for household use as\r\ndynamite,\" the _Bee_ stated. It said editorially, December 15, 1893,\r\nthat it had in its possession a letter from the secretary of the Iowa\r\nState Board of Health affirming that oil condemned by the State of Iowa\r\nis shipped to Nebraska. The oil inspector of the State made a vigorous\r\ndenial, but the _Bee_ refused to withdraw its statements. Its tests,\r\nit said, had been made by competent chemists. A suit is now pending\r\nin San Francisco, brought by the New Zealand Fire Insurance Company\r\nagainst the oil combination. It is charged that it sold low-test oil,\r\nthat its inflammability caused fire and destruction of a dwelling\r\ninsured by the insurance company, which was compelled to pay the loss.\r\nSome power, certainly not originating among the people, has for years,\r\nin States where the inspection laws required a high quality of oil,\r\nbeen at work procuring a reduction of the test. In some cases this\r\nhas been accomplished only after persistent lobbying for years, as in\r\nMichigan. The test in Michigan has been lowered by legislation, as\r\nin Nebraska, and with similar results. The reports of the Michigan\r\nState Board of Health show that as the standard was lowered, fires and\r\ndeaths from explosions increased. The Detroit _Tribune_ of December 27,\r\n1891, says that the reduction of the test in Michigan and Nebraska is\r\ndue to the avarice of the producers (refiners) and nothing less than\r\ncriminal carelessness of the legislators. The dangerous constituents of\r\npetroleum, such as naphtha and gasolene, are indistinguishable by the\r\neye of the buyer from kerosene. They can be as easily mixed with it as\r\nhot and warm water with cold. These reductions of the test in various\r\nStates permit mixtures more hazardous than dynamite to be sold to the\r\npeople, lulled into reliance upon the State inspectors. \"The advantage\r\nto the oil company,\" says the Detroit (Michigan) _Times_ of April 30,\r\n1891, \"is obvious. Naphtha and gasolene are worth, perhaps, three cents\r\na gallon. Kerosene is worth three times as much. A test which allows\r\none quart of kerosene and three quarts of gasolene to constitute a\r\ngallon of merchantable illuminating oil will enable a few more colleges\r\nto be endowed, though increasing the death-roll in a notable degree.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the demands of those who are conducting the agitation, noticed\r\nelsewhere, for the admission of American oils free into Canada is\r\nthat the standard of Canadian oil inspection be lowered. This, says\r\nthe Hamilton (Ontario) _Spectator_, will open the Canadian market to\r\nthe low-test and dangerous oils made by the American combination, and\r\n\"restore the old order of lamp explosions, with the consequent loss of\r\nlife and property.\"\r\n\r\nAn unwritten chapter of this story is the experience of the Ohio\r\noil producers, and the use of the inferior oil of the Ohio field to\r\nadulterate oils made from Pennsylvania petroleums.\r\n\r\nLord Coke's dictum about the decrease of quality never had a more\r\nspectacular illustration than was given at Oil City and Titusville\r\non Sunday, June 5, 1892. Oil Creek was high with rains. A dam burst\r\nand made the creek a flood. Its waters ate away the insufficient\r\nfoundations of tanks, and rivers of naphtha and gasolene and kerosene\r\noverran the river of water for miles. A spark did the rest. Oil\r\nrefineries took fire, tanks exploded. There were two raging seas--water\r\nbeneath, fire above. Men, women, children, animals, property were\r\nswept along in their intermingled waves. From every overturned tank\r\nand blazing refinery fresh streams of oil flowed into the sea of\r\nflame, which climbed the hills for the victims the other sea could not\r\nreach. Those who escaped drowning breathed in a more dreadful death.\r\nIt was a volcano and deluge in one. It was one of the most terrible\r\ncatastrophes of our times. Even the scare-heads of the newspapers could\r\nnot exaggerate its horrors. The governor of the State made a public\r\nappeal for help. The coroner's jury held an inquest at Oil City upon\r\nfifty-five bodies at one sitting. It declared the cause of the calamity\r\nto have been the gross carelessness of the owners and custodians of a\r\ntank of naphtha, in permitting it, while filled with 15,000 barrels of\r\nnaphtha, to stand without proper protection from fire and water. The\r\ntank was shown, by the testimony, to have stood on sand within a few\r\nfeet of the creek and without safeguard. It was shown that complaints\r\nhad been made to the managers of the refinery, which was one of the\r\nsubsidiary companies of the oil trust, about this tank and others\r\nbefore the disaster, but without avail. The coroner's jury laid the\r\nblame where it belonged--upon the company whose tank gave way. Its\r\nverdict said: \"The naphtha which caused this awful destruction of life\r\nand property ... was stored in a tank located on the bank of Oil Creek,\r\non the Cornplanter Farm, near McClintockville, where it was built about\r\nfour years previous to this time. At the time of its construction the\r\ntank was from twenty to thirty feet from ordinary high-water mark in\r\nthe creek, but this distance has been gradually reduced by the action\r\nof the water prior to this flood to between six and ten feet, and\r\nthis flood further washed away the ground up to and under the tank, a\r\ndistance of from fifteen to twenty feet. A part of the tank bottom,\r\nthus being left without support, tore out, allowing the naphtha to\r\nescape into the creek. The evidence of the watchman, James Marsh,\r\nshows that he realized danger from the undermining of the tank, for he\r\nmade a feeble effort previous to this flood to protect it by throwing\r\nloose stones between the tank and the creek. The jury find from the\r\nevidence that all persons owning and having in custody this tank and\r\nits contents were guilty of gross carelessness in permitting it, while\r\nfilled with naphtha, to stand without proper protection from fire and\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nThe company which owned this tank belonged to the oil combination.\r\nIt was, strange to say, one of the tanks of the Keystone refinery,\r\nto which Matthews, the Buffalo independent, had turned for a supply\r\nof crude oil when all other sources failed,[604] and which had been\r\nthereupon bankrupted and taken into the combination seven years before.\r\nHere was one fruit of that victory over competition. The coroner's\r\njury at Titusville reprobated in the strongest terms the folly of\r\nstoring oil in tanks within reach of high-water. It called upon\r\n\"citizens and officials, ... for the common good of all,\" to do what it\r\nsaid was \"entirely practicable: to so locate and guard and construct\r\noil-tanks and other receptacles of inflammable petroleum products that\r\nthey cannot be floated away, or the contents floated out of them by\r\nwater,\" and that \"in case of flood and fire lives and private property\r\ncannot be endangered by them.\" Although here and all over the oil\r\nregions the business was under the control of one combination, and\r\nhad been so since early in the seventies, the Titusville jury, less\r\ncourageous than that of Oil City, declared that it could \"attach no\r\nblame to any one in particular for the present loss of life,\" because\r\nthis \"custom of storing and manufacturing oil and its products,\r\nregardless of endangering the lives and property of others, had been\r\nallowed to grow up here as well as all over the oil regions.\" These\r\nverdicts have been followed by suits now pending in the Pennsylvania\r\ncourts, claiming heavy damages from the oil combination as responsible\r\nfor the disaster and the loss of life and property.\r\n\r\nThe Oil City and Titusville disaster is but a provincial affair\r\ncompared with the metropolitan avalanche of ruin which is all ready\r\nto move upon the cities on New York Bay from the refineries and tanks\r\nalong its shores. Several condensed oceans of unignited fire are\r\nwaiting for such accident as happens almost every day to some gas-works\r\nor refinery or tank-car. On creeks running into the East River, on bays\r\nopening from the New Jersey shore into the greater bay, in tanks whose\r\ncontents would overlay the whole sheet of water from the Narrows to\r\nHell Gate and Spuyten Duyvil, these volcanoes are dozing, and they are\r\nlight sleepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\"TO GET ALL WE CAN\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAre the combinations, trusts, syndicates of modern industry organized\r\nscarcity or organized plenty? Dearness or cheapness? \"They are doing\r\ntheir work cheaper,\" said one of the oil combination of himself and his\r\nassociates, \"than any rival organization can afford to do it, and that\r\nis their policy, and by that only will they survive.\"[605]\r\n\r\n\"We think our American petroleum is a very cheap light. It is our\r\npleasure to try to make it so,\" said its head.[606]\r\n\r\n\"Our object has always been to reduce rates, and cheapen the product,\r\nand increase its consumption by making the lowest price possible to the\r\nconsumer,\" said another.[607]\r\n\r\nEven if this were true-- But is it true?\r\n\r\nThe then president of the United Pipe Lines of the oil combination, who\r\nwas also president of a subordinate corporation, was a witness in 1879\r\nin the suit brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. His refinery,\r\nhe stated, did nothing but make the oil. \"It is taken and sold by\r\nanother organization\"--the oil combination. \"We agree to take the same\r\nprices that they take for their oil. It is kind of pooled--the sale of\r\nthe oil.\" The \"agreement,\" he said, is \"simply to hold up the price of\r\nrefined oil, ... to get all we can for it ... under some arrangement by\r\nwhich they keep the price up to make a profit.\" Not only was the price\r\nfixed under the agreement \"to get all we can,\" but the combination, as\r\nat Cleveland,[608] fixed the amount to be produced. The subordinate\r\ncompany was allowed to have nothing to do with the business--except to\r\ndo the work, and to do only as much as its superior chose to permit.\r\nOther refiners, in the same investigation, were shown to be sufferers\r\nfrom the same kind of \"grip.\" Asked what other concerns besides his\r\nof Oil City were in this arrangement, he named the principal ones of\r\nTitusville, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and New York.\r\n\r\n\"These companies were all acting in concert, were they?\"\r\n\r\n\"So far as sales of refined oil were concerned, I think they were.\"\r\n\r\nCapitalists are usually supposed to be hard of heart and head,\r\nsuspicious, great sticklers for \"black and white,\" and careful to\r\nhave all that is due them \"nominated in the bond.\" This arrangement,\r\nby which this witness and his associates put themselves entirely at\r\nthe disposal of others--as to how much they should manufacture, what\r\nfreight they should pay, what price they should receive, etc.--was not\r\nin writing.\r\n\r\n\"It is a verbal one.\"[609]\r\n\r\nThe purchase of the refineries at Baltimore by the oil combination\r\nin 1877, under the name of the Baltimore United Oil Company, was\r\nimmediately followed by an advance in price. The Baltimore _Sun_, in\r\nDecember, 1877, said: \"The combination has already begun to exert\r\nits influence on the market. Oil for home consumption was yesterday\r\nquoted at 14 cents, having raised from 11-1/2 cents, the quotation\r\non Wednesday. The combination will not make contracts ahead, which\r\nmight be interpreted to mean an intended advance in price.\" In Buffalo\r\nthe manager of one of the properties of the oil combination said in\r\nevidence: \"My son is on a committee, he told me, that regulates the\r\nprice of oil.\"[610] While the trust had the trade of Buffalo to itself,\r\nit held the price of oil at a high rate. \"In Buffalo there were then no\r\nrival works,\" said State's Attorney Quinby to the jury who were trying\r\nits representatives for conspiracy against a competing refinery, \"and\r\nwe were paying for kerosene 18 cents a gallon. To-day, with the little\r\nBuffalo company in the market making kerosene, you can get it for 6\r\ncents a gallon.\"\r\n\r\nThis Buffalo competitor was a very modest affair, insignificant in\r\ncapital and resources, but it cut down the price of oil as far away as\r\nBoston. It established there an agent who \"went around\" and \"cut the\r\nprices down,\" and then the agent of the combination \"went around and\r\ncut the prices further,\" as its Boston employé described it. He was\r\ninstructed, he said, \"to follow them down, ... only not to sell at a\r\nloss.\" Before this competitor came he had been selling oil as high as\r\n20 cents a gallon. \"We got the price down to 18 cents, and got down\r\nthen, I believe, to 8 cents, so that I have been selling them since\r\nthen at 8 cents.\"[611] Eight cents, then, was not at a loss--since\r\nhe had been told \"not to sell at a loss\"--and yet these passionate\r\npilgrims of cheapness had been making the Boston buyer pay 20 cents!\r\n\"I have been selling since at 8 cents,\" he says. This testimony was\r\ngiven in 1886; the reduction to 8 cents from 20 was made in 1882. Four\r\nyears' consumption of this oil had been given to the buyer in Boston at\r\n8 cents a gallon instead of 20, in consequence of the entrance of so\r\ninsignificant a competitor.\r\n\r\nWhen a member of the trust was testifying before the New York courts,\r\nhe referred to the competition of the independent of Marietta as \"his\r\npower for evil.\" Asked to define what he meant by his phrase \"power\r\nfor evil,\" he said, \"It was to make prices that would be vexatious\r\nand harassing.\" He was asked if it harassed the oil trust, and the\r\ncorporations connected with it, to have prices in any part of the\r\ncountry lower than they fixed.\r\n\r\n\"Lower than a reasonable basis.\"\r\n\r\n\"What they consider a reasonable basis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"[612]\r\n\r\nThat we can understand. But we cannot understand what the president of\r\nthe trust meant when he said, \"We like competition,\" for that would\r\nimply a natural proclivity for fellowship with the power of evil.\r\n\r\n\"Who fixes the price of oil in New York?\" was asked of one of the\r\nwitnesses before the Interstate Commerce Commission at Washington. That\r\nwas done, he said, by the selling agent of the oil combination. He \"has\r\nthe price marked in the New York Produce Exchange daily--the price at\r\nwhich they will sell oil.\"[613] When the vice-president of the company\r\nrepresenting the trust in St. Louis and the Southwest was on the stand\r\nbefore the Interstate Commerce Commission, he was asked what was the\r\nprice of oil in the territory in which he was operating. The price of\r\noil in tank-cars, in Arkansas, he said, \"is now and has been during\r\nabout three years or more--since Mr. Rice commenced shipping by water\r\nto Little Rock--10 cents per gallon. The average price, independent of\r\ncompetition, which I suppose is what you want, in the State of Texas is\r\nabout 13 cents per gallon in bulk, covering the whole State of Texas.\r\nThe average price per barrel would be about 17 cents, and the average\r\nprice in cases about 20 cents.\"[614]\r\n\r\n\"Since Mr. Rice commenced shipping by water to Little Rock;\" \"the\r\naverage price independent of competition in Texas\"--these are telltale\r\nphrases. Where the combination was \"independent of competition\" the\r\nprice was one-third greater.\r\n\r\nThe committee of Congress which investigated trusts in 1889 gathered\r\na great deal of sworn evidence--the details of which remained\r\nuncontradicted, and which were met only by general statements like\r\nthose quoted at the head of this chapter--showing how extortionate\r\nprices had been charged until competition appeared, that in all cases\r\na war of extermination had been made upon those competitors, and that\r\nwhen their business was destroyed prices were put up again. Losses in\r\ncompetitive wars were merely investments from which to draw dividends\r\nin perpetuity. The \"cheapness\" of the combination followed the\r\ncheapness of competitors, and was merely a feint, one of the approaches\r\nin a siege to overcome the inner citadel of cheapness, a strategic\r\ncheapness to-day on which to build dearness forever. This battle of\r\nprices is shown in a table covering fifty towns in Texas, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Kentucky, for three to five\r\nyears. The appearance of competitive oil, for instance, cut the prices\r\nof oil from 15 cents a gallon down to 10 in Paris, Texas; from 25 to\r\n15 in Calvert, Texas; from 22 cents to 10 in Austin, Texas; from 16 to\r\n5 in Little Rock, Arkansas--evidently a war price; from 16 to 8-1/2\r\nin Huntsville, Alabama; from 16 to 8 in Memphis, Tennessee, and so\r\non.[615] The committee of Congress submit pages of evidence of the\r\nreimposition of high prices the moment competition was killed off.\r\nIf the combination found a rival dealer out of oil for only a day it\r\n\"popped the prices up 3-1/2 cents.\"[616] \"One day,\" wrote one of the\r\ndealers, \"oil is up to 20 cents and over, and when any person attempts\r\nto import here, other than the vassals 'of the oil combination,' it is\r\nput down to 7 cents a gallon.\"[617]\r\n\r\nPrices were frequently put higher after the war than before. In the\r\ndebate in the Canadian Parliament last year on the proposal to reduce\r\nthe Canadian tariff, supported by a strong lobby from the American\r\noil trust, it was shown by affidavits that at Selma, Alabama, oil\r\nwas reduced during the \"war\" against outside refiners to 8 from 15\r\ncents. After \"competition was overcome,\" in the language of the South\r\nImprovement Company contract, the price was put up, not to 15 cents\r\nwhere it had been, but to 25 cents. In the same debate a large number\r\nof affidavits were exhibited showing how the price charged by the oil\r\ntrust in America varied in places near each other in arbitrary and\r\nextraordinary ways, as 7 cents a gallon at Port Huron, Michigan, and\r\n14-1/2 cents at Bay City, only a few miles distant. Under the rule of\r\nthe trust prices are on a mechanical basis everywhere, from the retail\r\nmarkets to the seaboard, where the refined, the manufactured article,\r\nis quoted at a lower price than the crude, its raw material.[618]\r\n\r\nIn the report of the tenth United States census in 1886, on the\r\nnecessaries of life, the retail price of kerosene is given for\r\nthirty-five places. At a few of these there was competition; there\r\nthe price was 12-1/2 to 15 cents a gallon. At all other points it\r\nranged from 20 to 25 cents. Such a tax on the 400,000,000 gallons of\r\noil consumed in this country is the only kind of income-tax that is\r\n\"American.\"\r\n\r\nApplication was made in May, 1894, by the Central Labor Union of New\r\nYork City to the Attorney-General of the State to vacate the charter of\r\nthe principal corporation in the oil trust. In the argument to support\r\nit, it was shown that New York consumers were then paying twice as much\r\nfor their lamp-oil as the people of Philadelphia, and three times as\r\nmuch as the foreign consumer buying in New York for export.\r\n\r\nThe trust, notwithstanding its powers of \"producing the very best oil\r\nat the lowest possible price,\" compels dealers to sign away their\r\nrights to buy oil where they can buy it the cheapest or best. When\r\nopposition is encountered from any of the retailers in a town the plan\r\nof campaign of its \"war\" is very simple. Some one is found who is\r\nwilling for hire to sell his oils at a cut price until the rest are\r\nmade sick enough to surrender. Then contracts are made with all the\r\ndealers, binding them to buy of no one else, and prices are put up to a\r\npoint at which a handsome profit is assured. After this competitors can\r\nfind no dealer through whom to sell, and the consumer can get no oil\r\nbut that of the monopoly. Price and quality are both thenceforth such\r\nas the combination chooses to make them. There are bargains in oil,\r\nbut one party makes both sides of them. \"We do not wish to ruin you\r\nwithout giving you another chance,\" said an agent of the combination\r\ngently to a merchant who persisted in selling opposition oil. \"Look at\r\nthis map; we have the country divided into districts. If you insist on\r\nwar we will cut the prices in your territory to any necessary extent\r\nto destroy you, but we lose nothing. We simply make a corresponding\r\nadvance in some other district. You lose everything. We cannot by any\r\npossibility lose anything.\"\r\n\r\nOnly by thus contracting themselves out of their rights could these\r\n\"free\" merchants get oil with which to supply their customers. \"Their\r\nagent,\" wrote a dealer of Hot Springs, Arkansas, \"has made threats to\r\nsome of our merchants that they must or shall buy oil from them and\r\nno one else, or if otherwise they would come here and ruin them--by\r\nfair means if they could, by underhand ways if necessary.\" Another\r\nfirm in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, wrote that the agent of the combination\r\nhad called upon them and several of the other large dealers to make\r\na \"contract, ... and, failing to do so, in a short time he threatens\r\nopening a retail house,\" as at Columbus.[619] Another wrote, December\r\n13, 1886, from Navasota that the monopoly \"will not sell unless you\r\nsign an obligation to buy from them and them only.\"[620]\r\n\r\nThis maintenance of prices until some \"power for evil\" appears with\r\nlower rates, then wars to kill, and raising of prices if the war\r\nends in victory--these phenomena of cheapness continue to date. Many\r\nchapters could be filled with accounts of these wars of which record\r\nhas been kept. To merely name the battle-fields would require pages.\r\nWhen the combination, through its agents, attacked Toledo in the courts\r\nfor undertaking the municipal supply of natural gas, it \"urged,\" as\r\nit is quoted in the language of the decision, \"that the main object\r\nand primary purpose of the act is to enable the city to supply its\r\nindividual inhabitants with fuel for private use and consumption at\r\na cheaper rate than they can obtain it from other sources.\" The act\r\nof the Legislature gave Toledo \"a power for evil.\" At Denver oil was\r\nsold at 25 cents a gallon until an independent company began refining\r\nthe petroleum which abounds in the Rocky Mountain basin. During the\r\nColorado war of 1892 all the familiar tactics--cut rates, espionage,\r\nand all--were employed. This continued after the dissolution of the\r\ntrust as before, showing that its change of name and form meant no\r\nreal change. In Pueblo and Colorado Springs the price was put down\r\nto 5 cents a gallon from 25 cents. In Denver the price was made 7\r\ncents. Spotters followed the wagons of the independent company to spy\r\nout its customers, and get them, by threats or bribes, to sign away\r\ntheir right to buy where they could buy cheapest. The comments of the\r\nlocal press did credit to the inspiriting mountain air of the American\r\nSwitzerland. The complaint recently filed with the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission by a dealer of the Pacific coast charges that, among other\r\ndiscriminations injurious to the public, the rates between the Pacific\r\ncoast and Colorado were so manipulated that the oil found in the Rocky\r\nMountains and refined in Colorado could not be shipped to California\r\nand the other Pacific states. Consumers there had to buy the oil of the\r\ntrust hauled all the way from Cleveland or Chicago. When an independent\r\nrefiner ran the blockade into New York, in 1892, and began selling to\r\nthe people from tank wagons, the price fell in New York, Brooklyn,\r\nand Jersey City from 8 and 8-1/2 to 4 and 4-1/2 cents. The St. Louis\r\n_Chronicle_ of May 19, 1892, reports a reduction of the price of the\r\nbest grade of oil to 5 cents a gallon--\"the fortieth reduction,\" it\r\nsays, made since an independent company \"entered the field three years\r\nago, at which time the price was 14-1/2 cents,\" as it would be still\r\nbut for competition.\r\n\r\nWar has been made on poor men, paralytics, boys, cripples, widows,\r\nany one who had the \"business that belongs to us.\" An instance taken\r\nfrom abroad will be the last. The combination between the American and\r\nthe Scotch refiners, formed several years ago, fixed the price of the\r\nprincipal product, scale, at threepence a pound in 1892. The break-up\r\nin that year was followed at once by a decline from threepence to\r\ntwopence. This is a saving to the public of $1,000,000 a year. \"All\r\nthe relative products,\" says the London _Economist_, November 12, 1892,\r\n\"have practically collapsed in value.\" Candles, for instance, declined\r\n20 cents a dozen, \"and the finer qualities were sold at the same rate\r\nas the commoner sorts.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the facts, to fit the phrase of one of the monopoly who\r\ndescribed to Congress how it \"bridges it to the consumer at the lowest\r\nreasonable rate.\" The \"bridge to the consumer\" spans 1872 to 1894 and\r\nEurope and America, but it is not a bridge of cheapness.[621]\r\n\r\nTo prove that oil is cheaper than it was is not to prove that it is\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\nAnything begins to be dear the moment the power to fix the price has\r\nbeen allowed to vest in one. The question whether our monopolies have\r\nmade things cheap or dear in the past pales before the exciting query,\r\nWhat will they do in the future, when their power has become still\r\ngreater, or has passed by death, descent, or sale into hands less\r\nshrewd and greedier? Such power never moves backward. Says President\r\nAndrews, of Brown University, in the article quoted below: \"When a\r\ncommodity is turned out under such conditions, cost no longer regulates\r\nthe price. This is done quite arbitrarily for a time, the seller's whim\r\nbeing perhaps sobered a little by his memory of old competitive rates.\r\nSlowly caprice gives way to law; but it is a new law--that of man's\r\nneed. Prices go higher and higher till demand, and hence profit, begins\r\nto fall off; and they then play about the line of what the market will\r\nbear, just as they used to about that of cost. The producer can be more\r\nor less exacting, according to the nature of the product. If it is a\r\nluxury, the new law may not greatly elevate prices above the old notch.\r\nIf it is a necessity, he may bleed people to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any reasonable price, say three or four times the present selling\r\nprice of refined oil, it is the cheapest light in the world, and if\r\nthe prices were advanced to 20 cents a gallon the sales would be as\r\nlarge as they are now at 7-1/2 cents,\" wrote Vice-president Cassatt,\r\nof the Pennsylvania Railroad, to the Pennsylvania Legislature, in 1881,\r\nopposing the Free Pipe Line bill. The possibilities here were touched\r\nupon by the New York committee of 1888: \"What the trust's course would\r\nhave been if, instead of increased production, it had been required to\r\ndeal with the problem of a constantly diminishing or stationary volume\r\nof oil, is an interesting subject for speculation. Certain it is that\r\nthe trust has the power to put up prices, even if it fails to exercise\r\nit. If, in the future, the field producing the commodity manufactured\r\nand sold by this combination of corporations shall fail to increase its\r\npresent product, or shall return a diminished quantity, the oil trust\r\nwill be able to fix the price of the product of its refineries in this\r\ncountry, if not in the world.\"[622]\r\n\r\nIt was not great capital which put this industry in the possession of\r\nthese enthusiasts for \"all the little economies.\" The same universal\r\nforces of cheapness which have been at work everywhere have been at\r\nwork upon the cost of the instrumentalities of production, and put\r\nmachinery, transportation, raw material, and market agencies within\r\nreach of moderate capital. Such great capital is wasteful capital. It\r\noperates through agents at great distances, attenuating incentives\r\nto energy and care. Many practical men, real refiners, who have been\r\nforced to give up their business to refiners of railroad privileges,\r\nhave testified to the same effect as the manufacturer who said to\r\nCongress in 1872: \"I believe a refinery of 100 barrels can be run\r\ncheaper than the larger establishments.\"[623]\r\n\r\nIf production on a natural scale, directed by the eye of the owner,\r\nwere not more economical than production mobilized from the metropolis\r\nby salaried men hundreds of miles away, the independent refiners\r\nand producers of Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio would not have\r\nbeen able to survive at all. It was said in one of the Buffalo\r\npapers by one of these independent refiners: \"There are several\r\nwell-equipped independent refineries in operation at the present time\r\nin Pennsylvania and Ohio oil-fields where the refiner has his own\r\ncrude oil, his own pipe line, and produces his own natural gas for\r\nfuel purposes. It is needless to say that an experienced and skilful\r\nrefiner operating under such favorable conditions can manufacture at\r\nless cost per barrel than any trust with a long list of pensioners and\r\nburdened with the control of two political parties and the maintenance\r\nof numerous city mansions, stock farms, and theological seminaries.\"\r\n\r\n NOTE.--The claims of the oil combination to the credit of having\r\n cheapened oil have been subjected by competent men to statistical\r\n tests. President Andrews, of Brown University, shows that from 1861 to\r\n 1872, inclusive--_i.e._, before any combination whatever existed--the\r\n net annual percentage of decrease in the price of refining oil and\r\n carrying it to tide-water--that is, the difference between the cost\r\n of the petroleum at the wells and of the refined at New York--was\r\n 10-4332/10000 cents; from 1873 to 1881, inclusive, the trust's infirm\r\n and formative period, the decrease was 7-8897/10000 cents; from 1882\r\n to 1887, inclusive, the years of its full maturity and vigor, the\r\n decrease was only 2-2879/10000 cents.[624]\r\n\r\n The New York _Daily Commercial Bulletin_ (April 4, 1892) made a\r\n similar study with similar results. It finds that under competition\r\n in the refining of oil the difference between crude at the wells and\r\n refined oil at New York was reduced from 13.45 cents per gallon in\r\n 1872 to 6.02 cents per gallon in 1881; under the reign of the trust\r\n the difference was 5.84 in 1891--greater than in 1882, when the trust\r\n began operations, when it was only 5.77. It concludes: \"It has been\r\n claimed that the oil trust has been a benefit to this county; that the\r\n economies which it has introduced in the transportation and refining\r\n of oil have been shared with the consumer, and that the enormous\r\n wealth which it has accumulated during the past ten years has been\r\n widely distributed. Not one of these claims has any substantial basis\r\n in fact.\"\r\n\r\n The comparisons of cheapness are made on the wholesale price at New\r\n York of \"export oil\"--an inferior, almost a refuse product. Its price\r\n must meet that made by the Russians. These comparisons, therefore,\r\n really shed no light on the price movements of oil going into\r\n consumption throughout the country. But the trust really gets the\r\n retail price on all its domestic output. A full statistical statement\r\n of the price movement in retail markets cannot be had; nor even of\r\n the wholesale, for the combination has lately adopted a policy of\r\n suppressing the wholesale quotations of the higher grades of oil for\r\n domestic consumption. Comparisons, therefore, built on the export\r\n price of this poor oil at New York, though good as far as they go, are\r\n of oils of a low illuminating power. Comparisons that would really\r\n show the part played by the combination as a true merchant--one who\r\n discovers and distributes abundance for all at a fair price for his\r\n service--can only be made by such illustrations as we have been giving\r\n from its utterances, plans, and actions. But for monopoly an average\r\n price of 5 cents a gallon could prevail throughout the United States,\r\n with a saving of hundreds of millions to the people.\r\n\r\n Trust prices are artificial prices, independent of supply and demand,\r\n and in their perfection superior even to panic. This is illustrated by\r\n the comparison below, made by Mr. Byron W. Holt:\r\n\r\n\r\n COMPARATIVE PRICES OF STAPLES DURING THE CURRENT DEPRESSION\r\n\r\n ------------------------------+---------------+-------------+-------------\r\n                               |               |             |Per cent. of\r\n                               |April 28, 1893 |July 20, 1894|Decline since\r\n                               |               |             |April 28,\r\n                               |               |             |1893\r\n ------------------------------+---------------+-------------+-------------\r\n Wheat, No. 2, red             | 0.76-3/8      | 0.56-1/2    |      26\r\n Corn, No. 2, mixed            |  .50          |  .47-1/2    |       5\r\n Cotton, middling upland       |  .07-13/16    |  .07-1/16   |      10\r\n Wool, Ohio and Pennsylvania, X|  .28          |  .18        |      36\r\n Pork, mess, new               |21.00          |14.00 @ 14.25|      33\r\n Butter, creamery              |  .30 @ 33     |  .17        |      45\r\n Sugar, raw, 96°               |  .03-15/16 @ 4|  .03-3/16   |      18\r\n Sugar, granulated             |  .05-1/16     |  .04-5/16   |      15\r\n Petroleum, refined, gal.      |  .0555        |  .0515      |       7\r\n Pig Iron, Bessemer, Chicago   |14.50 @ 15.00  |11.25 @ 11.50|      23\r\n Steel Rails, Chicago          |30.00 @ 32.00  |25.00 @ 27.00|      16\r\n Steel Beams, Chicago          |  .02          |  .01-1/2    |      25\r\n                               |               |             |\r\n                               | June 30, 1892 |June 30, 1894|June 30, 1892\r\n Coal, Bituminous, Pittsburg   |$ 1.07         | 0.86        |      20\r\n Coal, Anthracite, New York    | 4.15          | 4.15        |      00\r\n ------------------------------+---------------+-------------+-------------\r\n\r\n The prices of four of these products--granulated sugar, petroleum,\r\n steel rails, and anthracite coal--are controlled by strong\r\n trusts. These prices have declined, since the beginning of the\r\n depression--about May 1, 1893--not quite 10 per cent. Prices of the\r\n other ten products have declined 24 per cent.\r\n\r\n Under free conditions prices of manufactured articles would decline\r\n faster than prices of farm products. Cost of production can be lowered\r\n faster in machine or factory products than in farm products. Under the\r\n influence of trusts the natural order is not only reversed, but prices\r\n of farm products have declined more than twice as fast as prices of\r\n factory or trust products. Trust influence is conspicuous in the cases\r\n of sugar and coal. The price of raw sugar, in which there is no trust,\r\n has declined 5 per cent. since June 30, 1891. The price of granulated\r\n has advanced 4 per cent. The president of the trust admitted to\r\n Congress in 1894 that it had advanced the price 3/8 of a cent a pound.\r\n Cost of refining has declined since 1891. There being no well-defined\r\n trust in bituminous coal, its price has declined 30 per cent. since\r\n 1891. The price of anthracite coal has advanced 2 per cent. in the\r\n same time, because the producers have \"regulated\" production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nALL THE WORLD UNDER ONE HAT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This business belongs to us.\" This was the reply the president of the\r\noil combination made to a neighbor who was begging to be allowed to\r\ncontinue the refinery which he had successfully established before his\r\ntardier but more fortunate competitors had left their produce stores,\r\nlumber-yards, and book-keepers' stools. He could remember, the neighbor\r\ntold the New York Legislature, before there was any such company as\r\ntheirs, and when the president of the poor man's light was still in the\r\ncommission business opposite him and his refinery. He described how\r\nthe president left this commission business, and \"commenced to build\r\na refinery there of a small capacity.... He used to say to me, 'What\r\nis a good time to sell?' and 'What is a good time to hold?' as he said\r\nhe thought I knew.\" The day came when the neighbor who had been first\r\nfound that the last was to be first. He was making $21,000 to $22,000\r\na year, but he had \"to sell or squeeze.\" He had several conversations\r\nwith the new-comer who had been so successful in learning when it was\r\n\"a good time to hold.\" To save his livelihood, \"I did almost condescend\r\nto tease him,\" he testifies. But the only reply he could get was: We\r\nhave freighting facilities no one else can get.[625] This business\r\nbelongs to us. Any concern that starts in this business we have\r\nsufficient money to lay aside a fund to wipe it out. \"They went on just\r\nas if it did belong to them, and there were others started before he\r\ndid in it which I thought it belonged to quite as much as it did to\r\nhim.... I am wiped out and made a poor man.... I think they are making\r\na profit out of my ruin.\"\r\n\r\nHis refinery had been giving him a profit of $21,000 to $22,000 a\r\nyear. It had cost him $41,000, but he had to sell it for $15,000. This\r\npurchase of $41,000 for $15,000 was one of \"the little economies\" to\r\nwhich the trust ascribes its success. It was not a \"good time to sell,\"\r\nbut he sold. Part of the \"squeeze\" put upon him was the rebate given to\r\nthe buyer. He could not have got the rebate if he had applied for it,\r\nbut he would not apply for it. \"I made application for lower freights,\r\nbut not for any drawbacks; I did not suppose that was the right way to\r\ndo business.\"[626]\r\n\r\n\"This business belongs to us.\" This remark was not prophecy, but\r\nhistory. It was in 1878, and the claim had been already made good.\r\nThe New York Legislature, in 1879, reported that the speaker and his\r\nassociates had control of 90 or 95 per cent. of the industry. \"It has\r\nabsorbed and monopolized this great traffic, which ranks second on the\r\nlist of exports of our country.\"[627] This conclusion was based on the\r\nevidence of officers and stockholders.[628] Their shadow grew no less.\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission found in 1890 that they \"manufacture\r\nnearly 90 per cent. of the petroleum and its products in the United\r\nStates.\"[629]\r\n\r\n\"Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle.\" For the\r\nperfection of this triumph no trifle has been disdained, from the well\r\nin the mountain to the peddler's cart in the city. The bargemen of the\r\nAlleghany, the coasters of the sea-shore, and the stern-wheelers of\r\nthe Western rivers all had to go one way. \"We drove out the shipments\r\nin the schooners from Baltimore and Washington, and we stopped almost\r\nthe shipments by river down the Mississippi by boat,\" said one of the\r\nsuccessful men. His plan had been so thorough as even to seek to\r\n\"drive off the river schooners.\"[630]\r\n\r\nThe last stage in their economic development--that in which the people\r\nof the oil region lose the ownership of the oil lands and become hired\r\nmen--is already far along. Although at first the oil combination\r\nowned no oil lands to speak of--\"It does not own any oil wells or\r\nland producing oil, and never did,\" its president said, in 1880; \"an\r\ninfinitesimal amount,\" he said later[631]--it has of late years,\r\nthrough corporations organized for that purpose, been a heavy buyer and\r\nleaser of the best oil lands in Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Kentucky,\r\nand the West.\r\n\r\nMonopoly anywhere must be monopoly everywhere. At the beginning it was\r\nenough to control the railways; by these the pipe lines, refineries,\r\nand markets were got. These were secured, only to find that it was\r\nvital to control the source of supply. The producers once gave an\r\nillustration of what it would be for the sole buyer to come to the\r\nmarket and find that the oil he must have was not on sale at his\r\nprice.[632] \"We have during the past year,\" one of the combination\r\nsaid, in 1891, before a committee of the Pennsylvania Legislature,\r\n\"invested a very large amount of money, and have induced our friends to\r\ncome forward with new capital to engage in the business of producing\r\noil.\"[633] By the policy of becoming producers the combination has\r\nchanged its position from that of mere intermediary--though one as\r\nirresistible as a toll-gate keeper--to that of absolute owner. The\r\nspectre it has seen rise before it, of the producers organized as one\r\nseller to meet it as the only buyer, has been laid to rest.\r\n\r\n\"We are pushing into every part of the world, and have been doing\r\nso,\" the president told the New York Legislature in 1888.[634] Their\r\ntank-steamers go to all the ports of Europe and Asia, and their\r\ntank-wagons are as familiarly seen in the cities of Great Britain and\r\nthe Continent as of America. An agitation of extensive proportions was\r\nbegun in 1893 in the press of Canada and in the Dominion Parliament\r\nto admit American oil at a lower duty. There was no popular demand\r\nfor such a step. No general reduction of the tariff was proposed. The\r\nmovement was simultaneous in the press of different parts of Canada,\r\nand it was promoted by papers as important as the Toronto _Globe_\r\nand Montreal _Star_. It was resisted with desperation by the 20,000\r\npersons who are employed in the Canadian oil industries, the growth of\r\nthirty-two years--\"not a rich, gay, bloated population, rioting with\r\nthe plunderings of the farmers, revelling in all kinds of luxuries,\r\nmaking merry with their friends,\" says a newspaper correspondent, who\r\nvisited them in December, 1892, \"but a hard-working community, in which\r\nall live comfortably; few are rich.\"\r\n\r\nThis opposition was successful with the Dominion Parliament in that\r\nyear, and it refused to admit American oil at a lower tax. But the\r\nfinance minister then, by executive action, did in part what the\r\nLegislature had refused to do. By lowering the inspection duty and\r\nchanging custom-house conditions he made a considerable reduction in\r\nthe tax. The agitation to reduce the tariff was not relaxed, and was\r\nfinally successful in 1894, when Parliament lowered the duties on oil,\r\nand to that extent surrendered the Canada producers and refiners to\r\ntheir American competitors.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch refiners, some of whom have been in business forty years,\r\nhave become as loyal subjects of an American ruler as of their own\r\nqueen. They make only as much as he allows, and sell at the price he\r\nfixes. He has demanded year by year a greater proportion of their\r\nbusiness.[635] In 1892 they were notified that they must reduce their\r\noutput by 10 per cent.[636] The Scotch, anxious for the accelerating\r\nfuture, begged that the \"arrangement\" might be made for three years\r\ninstead of one. But this was denied them. The agent from America who\r\nbrought them their orders would promise no more than \"to place the\r\nmatter in a favorable light before his colleagues in America.\"[637]\r\nBy October of that year the capital of the Scotch companies, held\r\nmainly by small investors, had shrunk $5,000,000 in value. But to this\r\nitem the London _Economist_ adds the consolation that \"that powerful\r\norganization\"--the American--\"has for years professed the kindliest\r\nfeelings for the Scotch producers.\" Dr. Johnson said that much may be\r\nmade of a Scotchman if caught young. The American caught him old.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance fell heaviest, as always, on the working-men.\r\n\"Reduction in wages is now being effected,\" writes the managing\r\ndirector of the oldest and largest of the Scotch companies in the\r\n_Economist_. \"Another 10 per cent. reduction in miners' wages has been\r\nresolved upon,\" the _Economist_ announces in its issue of October 8,\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes that contributed to the downfall of the Scotch\r\nrefiners was the fact that the British government reduced the test\r\nrequired for illuminating oil. This new regulation opened the British\r\nmarkets to a flood of cheap oil from America.[638] The Scotch oil is\r\nbetter made and more expensive. \"We cannot tell,\" said a correspondent\r\nof the Glasgow _Herald_, \"what powerful interest the American oil\r\ncombination did not bring to bear on our government. The public had\r\nthen no champion, and as a rule never have on these occasions.\"\r\n\r\nThe unkindest cut of all is that it was from the Scotch manufacturers\r\nthemselves that their American rival and ruler learned the secrets of\r\nthe industry it is now absorbing on the instalment plan. In one of its\r\npublications it has told how its \"experts visited the great shale works\r\nin Scotland, and studied their methods,\" and how \"the consequence was\r\nthat extensive works were erected.\"[639]\r\n\r\nThe economic development of Germany is not so much behind that of\r\nGreat Britain and America as to seem uninviting to the unhasting\r\nbut unresting American. Some years ago enterprising German importers\r\ninvested a large amount of capital in tank-steamers, because they\r\nthought these solved the problem of the transportation of petroleum.\r\nWhen the Americans refused to supply them any longer with oil for their\r\nsteamers to carry, they saw that there was more in this problem than\r\nthey had guessed. Importers who had no steamers found one day that\r\nAmerican enterprise had secured practically all of them, and had very\r\ndecided notions as to whom cargoes should be taken. The heads of two or\r\nthree of the largest houses boarded a steamer for New York, and came\r\nback stockholders in a German-American company which controls most of\r\nthe German business, as the Anglo-American company controls that of\r\nGreat Britain. \"If the great company with unlimited capital cares to\r\nlose money, it can drive us from the field,\" was the explanation of\r\nthe head of one of the largest German concerns, as quoted in the Weser\r\n_Zeitung_.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the next year some Holland firms were invited into\r\nthe same shelter, and became the \"fittest\"; and then followed the\r\nBelgian and the Scandinavian countries. The Berlin _Vossische Zeitung_\r\nof June 18, 1891, described the line of march: \"One group of business\r\nmen after another is thus made superfluous and pushed aside. First\r\nthe wells, pumps, and refineries in America, then the American export\r\ntrade, then the private freight vessels adapted for transportation of\r\npetroleum, then the European import trade, then the export trade from\r\nEuropean ports, and, finally, this over-powerful company threatens to\r\nseize the entire retail trade in petroleum. It is a world monopoly.\"\r\nHundreds of boatmen engaged in a flourishing river trade in Germany\r\nwere driven out by tank-boats. If they had changed to tanks, they\r\nwould have been dependent on their opponent for the oil to fill\r\nthem. Importers in barrels were cut off by a change which the German\r\ngovernment made in the tariff on barrels. The Americans were also\r\nhelped by an increase in the German tariff on Russian oil of 50 per\r\ncent., which made it so much the more difficult for it to compete with\r\nAmerican oil. As one way to kill competition where it still existed,\r\nall statistics were suddenly withheld by the German-American member of\r\nthe trust. Neither exports nor imports were known except to the ruling\r\ncompany; all others were kept in the dark.\r\n\r\nThis success in Germany has not been due to favoritism on the highways.\r\nThe extraordinary discrimination on railroads in America would be\r\nimpossible in Germany. With hardly an exception the railroads are under\r\nthe supervision of the State, and are very carefully controlled. Even\r\nthe private roads would not dare to give any but the open rates. In\r\nAustria-Hungary, formerly, secret rates were in full swing, but the\r\nsystem is now said to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nPrices have declined in Germany, and the people at large make few\r\ncomplaints except about the quality of the American oil. It has become\r\nmore sooty than formerly. In the beginning it burns well, but it ends\r\nwith giving a very poor light. This has been conjectured to be due to\r\na mixture of the inferior Ohio oil with that of Pennsylvania; but \"it\r\ncannot be proved,\" the German chronicler reports.[640] \"The working\r\npeople,\" says one of the Berlin papers, \"will have to foot the bill,\r\nand the working people only. The well-to-do and rich of to-day can have\r\nother fuel and light, but to the oppressed working-man petroleum is as\r\ngreat a necessity as his potatoes.\" The German papers, in casting about\r\nfor means of checkmating the increase of prices which they believe will\r\nresult from the consummation of this monopoly, advocate the use of\r\nwater-power and also wind-power to create electricity.\r\n\r\nThe attention that has been attracted to the growth of this power does\r\nnot come from the public at large, but from those directly interested\r\nand the sympathy and interest of the German \"national economists.\"\r\nThe latter point out that the present cheap prices are \"war prices.\"\r\nThey predict that as soon as the world monopoly is established and\r\nall territory is under complete control a rise of prices will take\r\nplace. They are advocates of State monopoly as better than private\r\nmonopoly. If State monopolies prevent free competition, at least\r\nthey are able, they say, to give some compensation to those who are\r\nhurt. In the tobacco monopoly hundreds of millions were set aside\r\nby the German government for this purpose, but even that was not\r\nconsidered sufficient. But this monopoly is a private affair. It\r\nswallows the profits of all those whom it destroys. Numerous industries\r\nhave been ruined--importers, ship-owners, brokers, local dealers,\r\nexporters, retailers, river boatmen, and numerous other trades--but\r\nno one receives indemnity. The public opinion of the government, the\r\nReichstag, the national economists, the philanthropists, is active\r\nin support of the middle class, but in spite of all this a whole\r\ndepartment of industry has been torn away from it.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two \"independents\" in Germany whom, like the\r\nindependents in America, the trust has not yet been able to crush,\r\nthough it is turning the markets topsy-turvy for that purpose. The\r\n_Pall Mall Gazette_ of June 18, 1894, notes that the trust is selling\r\nrefined oil in Europe at prices lower than those at which crude oil can\r\nbe delivered from America.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian journals have been chronicling the absorption of the\r\nprincipal refineries of Austria and Hungary by a combination, of which\r\nthe Rothschilds are the most important members, as they are of that\r\nin Russia. This combination, which first appears in 1892, has by 1894\r\naccumulated a reserve of 3,000,000 gulden on a capital of 1,000,000\r\ngulden, and its profits for 1894 are expected to be 100 per cent.\r\nThe Prager _Lloyd_ of April 26, 1894, giving these and other facts,\r\nadds that \"the government of Austria as well as of Hungary takes the\r\nground that if a petroleum monopoly is to be formed it should be in the\r\nhands of the State, not of a corporation, certainly not of a foreign\r\ncorporation, least of all an American one.\"\r\n\r\nThis remedy of a State monopoly as an alternative to private monopoly,\r\nas suggested in Austria and Germany, has as yet had few advocates in\r\nAmerica. Our public opinion, so far as there is any public opinion,\r\nrestricts itself to favoring recourse to anti-trust laws and to\r\nboycotting the monopoly and buying the oil of its competitors. But\r\nthere are too few of these to go around, and they are shut out of most\r\nof the markets. The shrewd monopoly is itself the most diligent caterer\r\nto such American demand as there is for the \"anti-monopoly\" product. It\r\ndoes business under hundreds of assumed names, and employs salesmen at\r\nlarge salaries to push the sale of \"opposition oil\" in our disaffected\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nWith the news from Germany came the announcement that similar control\r\nhad been obtained of the business of the firm at Venice which did\r\nmost of the oil business of Italy, and a new company had been formed,\r\nof which the American \"trustees\" own a majority. In a letter sent to\r\nMinister Phelps, at Berlin, a resident representative of the American\r\noil combination says, as quoted in the New York _Tribune_, October\r\n5, 1891: \"For the furtherance of our programme and as participators\r\nin the large European investment which this programme involves, we\r\nhave sought and been fortunate enough to secure the co-operation of a\r\ncoterie of well-known merchants, who have been long and prominently\r\nidentified with the petroleum commerce of the Continent.\" The Società\r\nItalo-Americana del Petrolio (the Italian-American Oil Company) is in\r\nItaly what the concerns just described are in the countries to the\r\nnorth of it. The head of the oil combination was quoted by the New\r\nYork _Tribune_ of July 1, 1891, as saying: \"The cable despatches are\r\nsubstantially correct as regards our interest in the German and Italian\r\ncompanies.\"\r\n\r\nThe French government a year ago lowered the tariff on petroleum\r\none-half. This was followed, the French press reports, by the erection\r\nof a refinery by the American trust at Rouen, and the purchase by it of\r\nland in Marseilles, Cette, Bordeaux, and Havre for other refineries.\r\nThe machinery needed was shipped from America. Large offices were\r\nopened at Paris by the American combination for the administration of\r\nthe industry in France, which was to be concentrated into its hands\r\nlike that of the rest of Europe. The sequel, if the _Frankfurter\r\nZeitung_, a prominent German commercial paper, is correctly informed,\r\nis that the French refiners, as the Scotch did before them, have\r\ncome to terms with the American trust. It has agreed not to start up\r\nits refineries in France, not to sell any refined oil in America for\r\nshipments to France, and not to allow any American outsiders to compete\r\nwith the French refiners.\r\n\r\nThere was a report in June, 1892, that a Dutch company had succeeded\r\nin refining petroleum in Sumatra, one of the possessions of the\r\nNetherlands' East India colonies, and selling it in India. The\r\nsolicitor of the trust, asked about it by the New York _Times_, June\r\n5, 1892, said, \"It cannot be true.\" The oil combination, he continued,\r\n\"has agents in the Netherlands' East India colonies and at Sumatra, and\r\nit would certainly have heard of this corporation and its competition\r\nif there was anything worth hearing.\"\r\n\r\nThere are great oil-fields in Peru. Since the close of the war with\r\nChili there has been an active development of them, and the commercial\r\nreports of San Francisco say that fuel oil is now being supplied from\r\nthis source to our Pacific States. This has not been done by the\r\nPeruvians. It was an American who organized the oil industry of Peru.\r\nThe principal company was formed by the same expert who went years ago\r\nfrom Pennsylvania to Russia to Americanize the oil interests of the\r\nCaucasus. After he had succeeded in that task he went to Peru. He died\r\nin the spring of 1894. At about the time of his death the newspapers,\r\nby a coincidence that arrests attention, chronicled the departure from\r\nNew York of a well-known man who was going to Peru, as he stated in an\r\ninterview, to look after the interests of the members of the oil trust.\r\nBut there is no official information that they have any ownership or\r\ncontrol there.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the officers of the combination was before Congress, in\r\n1888, he was asked if there had been any negotiations by his associates\r\nwith the Russian oil men.\r\n\r\n\"We have never had any serious negotiations,\"[641] he replied.\r\n\r\nThe word \"serious\" was a slip. He withdrew it. \"We have never had any\"\r\nwas his revision. Three years later the same official, in a speech to\r\npersuade the Pennsylvania Legislature that the pipe-line interests of\r\nthe oil country did not need the regulation by the State then under\r\ndebate, but were abundantly safeguarded by him and his associates,\r\nsaid: \"It may not be amiss for me to say that we have had, at different\r\ntimes during the last several years, most flattering propositions\r\nfrom people who are identified with the Russian petroleum industry,\r\nto come there and join them in the development and introduction of\r\nthat industry. We have declined these offers, gentlemen, always and\r\nto this day, and have held loyal to our relations to the American\r\npetroleum.\"[642]\r\n\r\nThere had been negotiations, after all!\r\n\r\nThe reports of the United States consul-general at Berlin, in\r\n1891, transmitted many interesting articles from the German papers\r\nconcerning the alliance which it was believed had been made between\r\nthe Rothschilds and the American oil combination. A company managed by\r\nthe great bankers has obtained a commanding position in the Russian\r\noil business, and the American and the Russian were even then said to\r\nhave divided the world between them. The Berlin _Vossische Zeitung_\r\nsaid: \"Heretofore the two petroleum speculators have marched apart,\r\nin order to get into their hands the two largest petroleum districts\r\nin the world. After this has been accomplished they unite to fight\r\nin unison, and to fix as they please the selling price for the whole\r\nworld, which they divide between themselves. So an international\r\nspeculating ring stands before the door, such as in like might and\r\ncapital power has never before existed, and everywhere the intelligible\r\nfear prevails that within a short time the price of an article of use\r\nindispensable to all classes of people will rise with a bound, without\r\nits being possible for national legislation or control to raise any\r\nobstacles.\"[643]\r\n\r\nBut some of the closest European observers have seen reasons from\r\nthe beginning to believe that the Rothschilds are in the Russian oil\r\nbusiness only as the agents of the American combination. This is freely\r\nasserted by the Continental press. The policy of the Rothschilds has\r\nbeen never to engage in commercial enterprise on their own account.\r\nThe tactics used by the Rothschilds in oil have been an almost exact\r\nreproduction of those of the combination in America. From the first\r\nthey gave the subject of freights their special attention. They showed\r\nno ability for new or independent undertakings, but they tried, to use\r\nthe words of an Austrian-Hungarian consular report from Batoum in 1889,\r\n\"following the example of the combination in the United States, to get\r\nthe bulk of the Russian petroleum trade into their hands\"; using the\r\nlarge money power at their command for speculation, freely advancing\r\nmoney for leases and delivery contracts, and specially acquiring all\r\nthe available means of transportation. The experience of the people of\r\nParker[644] is recalled by the statement that the Rothschild company\r\nwould leave hundreds of cars loaded with petroleum on the tracks for\r\nweeks to prevent competitors from shipping and from filling their\r\ncontracts. When the city of Batoum, in 1888, refused to allow it to lay\r\npipes over the city lands to the harbor, it was with the enthusiastic\r\napprobation of the agitated citizens. The authorities gave as their\r\nreason that through large establishments of this kind the capitalists\r\ngained a monopoly, crushing out smaller producers to the disadvantage\r\nof all classes of the population. In the absence of official\r\ninvestigations, a free press, and civilized courts--that knowledge\r\nwhich is not only power but freedom--it is impossible for any one in\r\nRussia, or out of it, to know the truth as to the relations of the\r\nRothschilds to the American monopoly. The latest news in the summer of\r\n1894 is of a great combination of Russian and American oil interests,\r\nunder the direction of the Russian Minister of Finance, for a division\r\nof territory, regulation of prices, and the like. Information of this\r\nwas given to the world by that minister's official organ in November,\r\n1893. Thus says the Hanover (Germany) _Courier_ of November 11th: \"With\r\nthe direct sanction of the Russian government the management of the\r\nenormous wealth that lies in the yearly production of Russian petroleum\r\nwill be concentrated in the hands of a few firms.... The Russian\r\ngovernment lends its hand for the formation of a trust that reaches\r\nover the ocean--a trust, under State protection, against the large mass\r\nof consumers. This is the newest acquisition of our departing century.\"\r\n\r\nIt was announced that, in pursuance of this plan, the Russians were to\r\nbe given exclusive control of certain Asiatic markets. The officers\r\nof the American combination are not easily reached by newspaper men.\r\nBut when this news came long interviews with them were circulated in\r\nthe press of the leading cities, dwelling upon the \"Waterloo\" defeat\r\nthey had suffered, and reassuring the people with this evidence\r\nthat there was, after all, \"no monopoly.\" The Russian interests are\r\ndominated by the Rothschilds, and if the Rothschilds are, as these\r\nEuropean observers declare, merely the agents of the Americans, even\r\nunsophisticated people can understand the cheerfulness with which the\r\ntrustees in New York dilate on their Waterloo at the hands of their\r\nother self. Only this could make credible the report that the world has\r\nbeen divided with the Russians by our American \"trustees,\" who never\r\ndivide with anybody. In dividing with the Russians they are dividing\r\nwith themselves.\r\n\r\nThough it is reported that discriminations by the government railroads\r\nof Russia were used to force the Russian producers into this\r\ninternational trust, still, at worst, every Russian producer was given\r\nby his government the right to enter the pool. But no similar right for\r\nthe American producer is recognized by our trust. It admits only its\r\nown members. The others must \"sell or squeeze.\" There is something\r\nin the world more cruel than Russian despotism--American \"private\r\nenterprise.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the conditions said to have been made by the Russian government\r\nis the natural one that the American trust, as it has agreed to do for\r\nthe French, must protect its Russian allies from any competition from\r\nAmerica. Extinction of the \"independents\" has therefore become more\r\nimportant than ever to the trust. The prize of victory over them is not\r\nonly supremacy in this country, but on four other continents. This will\r\nexplain the new zeal with which the suppression of the last vestige of\r\nAmerican independence in this industry has been sought the last few\r\nmonths of 1893 and in 1894. Especially strenuous has been the renewal\r\nof the attack on the pipe line the independents are seeking to lay to\r\ntide-water, and which they have carried as far as Wilkes-barre.[645]\r\n\r\nThat pipe line, as it is the last hope of the people, is the greatest\r\nmenace to the monopoly. The independents, as they have shown by the\r\nfact of surviving, although they have to pay extraordinary freights and\r\nother charges from which the trust is free, can produce more cheaply\r\nthan the would-be Lords of Industry, as free men always do.[646] By\r\nmeans of this pipe line, suspended though it is at Wilkes-barre, are\r\nnow made the only independent exports of oil that go from America to\r\nEurope. Once let the \"outsiders\" with their line reach the sea-shore\r\nand its open roads to the coast of America and Europe, and it will be\r\na long chase they will give their pursuers. Everything that can be\r\nbrought to bear by market manipulation, litigation, and other means is\r\nnow being done to prevent the extension of this line, and to bankrupt\r\nthe men who are building it through much tribulation. The mechanical\r\nfixation of values, by which the refiners who use this line to export\r\noil are compelled to meet a lower price for the refined in New York\r\nthan can be got for the crude out of which it is made, has been already\r\nreferred to, and, as shown above, the same prestidigitation of prices\r\nis being resorted to in Europe against the independents of Germany.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1894 the independent refiners and producers resolved to\r\nconsolidate with this pipe line some other lines owned by them in order\r\nto strengthen and perfect the system, and put it in better shape to\r\nbe extended to tide-water. This consolidation was voted by a large\r\nmajority both of stock and stockholders. But a formidable opposition\r\nto it was at once begun in the courts by injunction proceedings in\r\nbehalf of one man, a subordinate stockholder in a corporation of\r\nwhich the control is owned, as he admitted in court, by members of\r\nthe oil trust.[647] The real litigant behind him, the independents\r\nstated to the court, was the same that we have seen appear in almost\r\nevery chapter of our story, with its brigades of lawyers. \"An unlawful\r\norganization,\" the independents described it to the court, \"exercising\r\ngreat and illegal powers, ... and bitterly and vindictively hostile to\r\nour business interests.\" They came into court one after the other and\r\ndescribed the ruin which had been wrought among them, telling the story\r\nthe reader has found in these pages.\r\n\r\n\"It is our hope,\" they said, \"when we once reach the salt-water that\r\nthere will be no power there controlling the winds and the waves, the\r\ntides and the sun and moon, except the Power that controls everything.\r\nWhen we once are there the same forces that guide the ships of this\r\nmonopoly to the farther shore will guide ours. The same winds that waft\r\nthem will waft ours. There is freedom, there is hope, and there is\r\nthe only chance of relief to this country.... Through three years of\r\nsuffering and agony we have attempted to carry on our purpose.... You\r\ncould have seen the blood-marks in the snow of the blood of the people\r\nwho are working out their subscription as daily laborers on that line\r\nwith nothing else to offer.\"\r\n\r\nThe injunctions asked for by this opposition were granted by the lower\r\ncourt, but the independents took an appeal to the Supreme Court of\r\nPennsylvania. They first placed their petition for the rehearing in the\r\nhands of the chief-justice on Thursday, May 24th; on Monday, May 28th,\r\nthe petition was renewed before the full court; on Thursday, May 31st,\r\nthe court adjourned for the summer without taking any action upon the\r\npetition. The court in July agreed to hear the case at the opening of\r\nits next term, the first Monday of October. Section II. of Article I.\r\nof the Constitution of Pennsylvania says: \"All courts shall be open,\r\nand every man, for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person,\r\nor reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and\r\njustice administered, without sale, denial, or delay.\" To guard against\r\nthe injustice which might arise by the granting of special injunctions\r\nby the lower courts--like that granted in this case--which might\r\nremain for months without remedy, the Legislature, in 1866, enacted\r\na law which reads as follows: \"In all cases in equity, in which a\r\nspecial injunction has been or shall be granted by any Court of Common\r\nPleas, an appeal to the Supreme Court for the proper district shall be\r\nallowed, and all such appeals shall be heard by the Supreme Court in\r\nany district in which it may be in session.\"\r\n\r\nAs if there had not been enough to try these men, misfortune marked\r\nthem in other ways. The Bradford refinery of the president of their\r\npipe line was visited by a destructive fire during these proceedings\r\nin court. The Associated Press despatches attributed the fire to\r\n\"spontaneous combustion,\" whatever that may be. But in another\r\nnewspaper an eye-witness described how he saw a man running about the\r\nworks in a mysterious way just before the flames broke out. On the same\r\nday, by a coincidence, the main pipe of the independent line was cut,\r\nand the oil, which spouted out to the tree-tops, was set on fire at a\r\npoint in a valley where the greatest possible damage would result, and\r\nthe telegraph wires were simultaneously cut, so that prompt repairs\r\nor salvage of oil were impossible. The Almighty is said to favor the\r\nheaviest battalions, and accident, if there is such a thing, seems to\r\nhave the same preference, as has been shown in many incidents in our\r\nhistory, such as the mishaps to the Tidewater pipe line, and the Toledo\r\nmunicipal gas line.[648]\r\n\r\nAn intimation is given in the Continental press as to one of the\r\nmotives under which the Russian government acted in promoting the\r\nalliance between the Russian and American oil men. It desired, it\r\nis said, to secure the influence of the powerful members of the\r\noil combination in favor of certain plans for which Russia needed\r\nco-operation in America. There has been nothing for which the Russian\r\ngovernment has so much needed \"sympathetical co-operation\" in America\r\nas for the ratification of the Extradition Treaty. The Russian\r\ngovernment has obtained this ratification, and obtained it in a way\r\nwhich indicated that some irresistible but carefully concealed American\r\ninfluence was behind it. The New York _World_, in its editorial\r\ncolumns of May 25, 1894, made the suggestion that the power behind\r\nthis treaty of shame was that of the oil trust, earning from the czar\r\nthe last link in its chain of world monopoly. It asked if it was the\r\ninfluence of the oil combination that induced the Senate's consent\r\nto this \"outrageous treaty.\" \"Was this one of the conditions upon\r\nwhich that monopoly was permitted to secure its present concessions\r\nfrom Russia? Did it wield an influence in the Senate like that\r\nwhich the sugar trust has since exercised, though for an advantage\r\nof a different kind?\" The Philadelphia _Press_ points out that the\r\nRussian government had long and unsuccessfully sought to obtain the\r\nratification of this treaty, but at last got it quickly and quietly.\r\nDid the oil combination, it asks, \"succeed in bartering the character\r\nof this country as a political sanctuary for the monopoly of the\r\nworld's markets?\" Seldom has any public measure been so universally and\r\nso indignantly condemned in America as was this proposal to use the\r\npowers of Anglo-Saxon justice to return men who were accused only, and\r\nwere, therefore, legally innocent, to be tried without jury, counsel,\r\npublicity, or appeal. Never has public opinion availed less. The\r\nFederal executive refused even to delay the ratification in deference\r\nto the sentiment against it. Those who were active in the agitation\r\nagainst the treaty found something inexplicable in the unresting\r\nand unlistening relentlessness with which it was pushed through.\r\nNapoleon said that in fifty years Europe would be all Russian or all\r\nrepublican. Even he did not dream that republican America would become\r\nRussianized before Europe. The San Francisco _Call_ of March 3, 1894,\r\ndiscussing the report that a commercial treaty with China was under\r\nconsideration at Washington, says the negotiation is in the interest\r\nof the oil combination. It warns the public that the trust is willing\r\nto reopen the opium trade in reciprocity to China for better terms for\r\nthe admission of American petroleum. This free trade with China and\r\nRussia in the souls and bodies of Russians, Chinese, and Americans\r\nwould add only another instance of the many manipulations of government\r\nwhich this combination has successfully attempted in all parts of the\r\nworld--in the tariffs of France, Germany, Cuba, Canada, and our own\r\ncountry; in the raising or lowering of the governmental requirements\r\nas to explosiveness of oil sold the people in England and the United\r\nStates, and in the subsidy legislation by which it got from Congress\r\nfor its ocean steamers a privilege rigorously denied by law to all\r\nother citizens.\r\n\r\nIn this the oil trust is but an illustration. What it has done scores\r\nof other combinations have accomplished, though not with equal\r\ngenius. The Hon. John De Witt Warner, member of Congress from New\r\nYork, has published a list of one hundred trusts which have been able\r\nto influence the tariff legislation of the country in their favor.\r\nThe orgy of the sugar trust and Congress, out of which the tariff\r\nbill of 1894 was born, was in the plain view of all the people. \"The\r\nappalling fact already disclosed,\" the New York _Daily Commercial\r\nBulletin_, the most important commercial and financial daily in the\r\nUnited States, said in its editorial columns of June 4, 1894, \"is\r\nthat for some months past the sugar trust has been the government of\r\nthe United States.\" The _Bulletin_ estimates that the profit to the\r\ntrust of one detail of the tariff bill postponing the duty on raw\r\nsugar for six months will be $34,620,000. In all this our country is\r\nnot singular. The governments of Europe are used as the instruments\r\nof profit for private enterprise to an extent which the people endure\r\nonly because they do not understand it. The latest instance is one of\r\nthe best. The _Investor's Review_ of London, England, in May, 1894,\r\ncalls attention to the fact that upon the accession of Lord Rosebery\r\nto the Premiership of England the hitherto outspoken opposition of\r\nthe War Office to the Maxim gun had become entirely silent, and the\r\ngun had been put into use in the army without competitive trial with\r\nother machine-guns, some of them its superiors. \"This is an unfortunate\r\nfact for Lord Rosebery,\" says the _Investor's Review_, \"because of his\r\nrelationship to the Rothschilds.\" This great house, the _Review_ says,\r\nhas \"a strong pecuniary interest in the Maxim-Nordenfeldt Company,\"\r\nand his lordship's affinities to the house \"have not in the past been\r\nconfined to those of family relationship alone, but extend to community\r\nof interests on the stock exchange.\" The _Review_ therefore appeals\r\nto Lord Rosebery, for his own sake and the sake of the government \"to\r\nprove by his deeds that he not only has had nothing to do with it, but\r\nwill peremptory stop this crime.\" If not, the _Review_ hopes enough may\r\nbe made of the scandal to overthrow Lord Rosebery's government, for it\r\ndesires \"to see a beginning made of the endeavor to purge Parliament of\r\nthe guinea-pig director, the stock-gambler and punter, and the whole\r\nunclean brood of City 'bulls' and 'bears,' jobbers in patents, bribers\r\nand bribed, who help to degrade public life.\"\r\n\r\nWe of America are most sovereign when we sit in Constitutional\r\nConvention by our representatives, and change the fundamental law\r\nas we will. The Constitutional Convention gives us the unique power\r\nof peaceful and perpetual revolution, to make bloody and spasmodic\r\nrevolutions unnecessary. Of all the inventions of that ablest group\r\nof statesmen the world has seen--the founders of this government--this\r\nis the greatest. The people of the State of New York are holding a\r\nConstitutional Convention in 1894 to enlarge the garment of 1846 to\r\nfit the growth of half a century. In that half-century the revolution\r\nin society and industry which had been getting under headway ever\r\nsince the steam-engine and competition were invented has come to its\r\nconsummation. But the basic law of the Empire State has faced this\r\nnew world as changeless as the sphinx. Nearly half the other states\r\nhave made new constitutions, or amended the old ones to bring law into\r\nline with life. Pennsylvania forbids the common carrier to become\r\nthe owner of coal-mines, or to consolidate with competing carriers,\r\nor to give preference to any citizen. Michigan, Illinois, Nebraska,\r\nColorado, and many other states have framed provisions to control\r\nthe abuse of industrial and highway power. The State of Washington\r\nin its Constitution declares that \"monopolies and trusts shall never\r\nbe allowed in this State,\" and it forbids any association \"for the\r\npurpose of fixing the price or limiting the production, or regulating\r\nthe transportation of any product or commodity.\" The manual of the\r\nconstitutions of the world prepared for the use of the New York\r\nconvention shows that fifteen of the states of the Union have in one\r\nway or another recognized the revolution which has taken place in\r\nthe industrial economy of the people, and sought to meet it with the\r\nnecessary political safe-guards.\r\n\r\nWhen the delegates of the citizens of New York State meet in May,\r\n1894, at Albany, in such a time to face such problems, the press\r\nnotes that a large proportion of them are corporation lawyers. The\r\nplace of president of the convention is secured by the chief counsel\r\nof the oil trust. He is in Albany to resist the application to the\r\nAttorney-General of the State to move for the forfeiture of the charter\r\nof the principal corporation in the trust, and on his way he plucks the\r\npresidency of the Constitutional Convention. \"It is truly a momentous\r\nevent,\" he says in his opening speech, \"when the delegates of many\r\nmillions of people gather together after an interval of fifty years\r\nalmost, for the purpose of revising and amending the fundamental law of\r\nthe State.\" The delegates thus momentously assembled, when they came to\r\nchoose the officer who was to wield over them a power as great as that\r\nof the Speaker over the Federal House of Representatives, momentously\r\nselected the most conspicuous attorney of the most conspicuous\r\nembodiment of the forces with which the people are in conflict. The\r\npresident found words of kindly reference for many great questions--of\r\neducation, suffrage, city government, and the like--but for the great\r\nquestions of social power which fifteen states have found serious\r\nenough for constitutional cognizance he had not a syllable. No plan or\r\neven suggestion, great or little, for the new Constitution can reach\r\nthe convention direct. All must go to the appropriate committee, to be\r\nsmothered or reported, as the case may be. There are thirty of these\r\ncommittees, and they are made up by the president of the convention,\r\nwho also designates their chairmen. Each committee has its subject, and\r\nthe subjects cover the bill of rights, the regulation of suffrage, the\r\ncontrol of corporations, the election of judges, future amendments of\r\nthe Constitution, and every other part of the organic law. Practically\r\nthe work of the convention will be the work of the committees, and the\r\ncommittees are the work of one who is not only the attorney of the\r\noil trust, but is a part of the trust, a member of the organization.\r\n\"I happen to own one hundred shares in the Standard Oil Trust,\" he\r\nsaid in his argument in Albany before the Attorney-General in behalf\r\nof the trust. The trust has given formal notice that out of deference\r\nto public opinion and the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio, and\r\nin pursuance of an agreement with the late Attorney-General of New\r\nYork,[649] it had dissolved itself. But this distinguished member\r\ndisregards the dissolution, for reasons of personal convenience, as he\r\ntells the Attorney-General. \"I have never gone forward and claimed my\r\naliquot share.\" The character of this trust, of which the president\r\nand organizer of the Constitutional Convention persists in being a\r\nmember to the extent of refusing to be \"dissolved\" out of it, has been\r\nadjudicated. It was, the Supreme Court of Ohio said,[650] \"organized\r\nfor a purpose contrary to the policy of our laws. Its object was to\r\nestablish a virtual monopoly ... throughout the entire country, and\r\nby which it might not merely control the production but the price\r\nat its pleasure. All such associations are contrary to the policy\r\nof our State and void.\" A similar judgment has been passed upon the\r\ntrust by the judiciary of the State of which this president of the\r\nConstitutional Convention, besides being an officer of the courts,\r\nis a citizen. It was entered into, the Supreme Court of New York has\r\nsaid,[651] \"for the purpose of forming a combination whose object was\r\nto restrict production, control prices, and suppress competition, and\r\nthe agreement was therefore opposed to public policy and void.\" And a\r\nhigher court, the highest in the State, the Court of Appeals, decided\r\nin the sugar-trust, case that a trust was in avoidance and disregard of\r\nthe laws of the State.\r\n\r\nTo the monopoly of oil, which was the starting-point, are being\r\nadded by its proprietors, one after the other, as we have shown, a\r\nprogressive series of other monopolies, from natural gas to iron. To\r\nthese assets is now to be added our bill of rights. The long fingers\r\nof this power of mortmain reincarnate are long enough to reach from\r\nits counting-room to the Constitutional Convention. The new Magna\r\nCharta, to which the people look for help against void and unlawful\r\ncombinations, is to be drafted by committees made up by the attorney of\r\nthe chief of these void and unlawful combinations. The instrument which\r\nis to protect the people against monopoly will come to them only after\r\nevery section has been exposed to the moulding touch of the greatest\r\nmonopoly in history. \"This business belongs to us,\" and theirs is the\r\nfirst and the last hand on the reins of the convention. The people can\r\nvote on the Constitution after it is made, but the trust will see it\r\nmade. If the new Constitution is made so obnoxious that it is rejected,\r\nas that of 1867 was, the old Constitution will do for the next fifty\r\nyears as for the last fifty. It is not monopoly that needs the revision.\r\n\r\nIs this the end? When before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the\r\nhead of the combination was asked:\r\n\r\n\"The properties included in your trust are distributed all over the\r\nUnited States, are they not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not all over the United States. They are distributed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they not distributed, and are they not sufficiently numerous\r\nto meet the requirements of your business from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific, and from the Gulf to the northern boundary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.\"[652]\r\n\r\nThe reply came in a tone and with a smile so significant that it was\r\nanswered by a comprehending laugh from the whole room--judges, lawyers,\r\nreporters, spectators, and all.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\"NOT BUSINESS\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis \"business success\" is the greatest commercial and financial\r\nachievement of history. Its broad foundation was laid in the years\r\nfrom 1872 to 1879, the severest time of panic for others the world\r\nhas known. A universal jaundice of ill-fortune has given its sallow\r\ncomplexion to every one else. From the Alleghanies to the Caucasus\r\nthousands of men have been somehow thrown out of work because so much\r\nnew work has come to the world. \"At the flash of a telegraphic message\r\nfrom Cleveland, Ohio,\" said the people of the oil regions in their\r\nappeal to the Governor of Pennsylvania in 1878, \"hundreds of men have\r\nbeen thrown out of employment at a few hours' notice, and kept for\r\nweeks in a state of semi-starvation.\" These men filled up many of the\r\ninsurrectionary ranks of the great railway strike of 1877, as the\r\nemployés of the Pennsylvania Railway declared in a public communication\r\nat that time. The eight oil-producing counties of Pennsylvania were\r\nsaid by the general council of the petroleum producers, in a public\r\naddress in 1879, to be \"fast sinking beneath such financial distress\r\nthat resistance to threatened bankruptcy or servitude could not long\r\nbe made.\" They grew too poor to pay the counsel they employed to\r\nhelp them in the courts, the legislatures, and before the executive\r\nof Pennsylvania and Congress. \"The universal complaint we find is\r\nthe poverty of the people, not their unwillingness to give.\" \"I am\r\nashamed,\" said one of them in court, \"to see our counsel every day on\r\naccount of the beggarly amounts I have paid them. A large number of\r\nproducers have subscribed that have not paid.\"[653]\r\n\r\nMen who were \"frozen out\" of their occupation in transporting or\r\nrefining oil took to digging wells. \"That is the only thing they have\r\nbeen allowed to do. They went on in a wild way, hunting new oil, and\r\nwhen they found it they would develop it rapidly.\" This made oil fall\r\nin price, and the more they produced the more they had to produce. The\r\nwages of labor kept going down. They were lower in 1888 than they were\r\ntwenty-four years before. \"A well-digger that I paid $6 a day and his\r\nexpenses twenty-four years ago is now working for $40 a month. That\r\nis true of every department of the oil business so far as the wages\r\nof workmen are concerned.\" \"We were $10,000,000 poorer at the end of\r\n1887 than at the beginning,\" said the association of oil producers of\r\nPennsylvania. Their executive committee the next year said the people\r\nwere on \"the verge of bankruptcy.\"[654]\r\n\r\nThe railroads were no happier than the laborers, the producers, the\r\nmanufacturers, or the merchants. As early as 1879 Vanderbilt II.\r\ndeclared that the oil business of the railroads--worth $30,000,000 a\r\nyear--had been destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"I think the business is gone.\"[655]\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a number of refiners and producers of Pennsylvania, in a formal\r\nappeal to Governor Pattison, asked him to investigate the causes\r\nwhich were working \"to the injurious depression if not the ultimate\r\ndestruction of a great industry.\" In the same year mutterings of a\r\nturbulent discontent and threats of violence and the destruction of\r\nproperty, repeating those of 1872, were heard again in Pennsylvania\r\nand in Ohio, which had become an oil-producing State. \"Many of the oil\r\nproducers,\" a member of their protective association in Ohio said, in\r\nthe spring of 1892, \"are in a bad way. They are at that point that\r\nthey don't know just where their next sack of flour is coming from, and\r\nI am not surprised at anything they may do.\"\r\n\r\nThis area of low pressure, following the habit of American storms, made\r\nitself felt abroad in bankruptcies and falling wages from Scotland\r\nto Baku and beyond. Meanwhile the little nest-egg of nothing of the\r\ngroup which came into the field in 1862 grew to $1,000,000 in 1870; to\r\n$2,500,000 in 1872; to $3,500,000 in 1875; to $70,000,000 in 1882; and\r\nin 1887 to a capital of $90,000,000, which the New York Legislature\r\nreported in 1888, \"according to the testimony of the trust's\r\npresident,\" to be worth \"not less than $148,000,000.\"[656] Before\r\nthe trust was dissolved in name, in 1892, and the \"trustees\" betook\r\nthemselves to the greater seclusion of separate corporations, acting in\r\nconcert, its stock sold as high as 185, a valuation of $166,500,000 for\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nIts dividends had been $10,800,000 a year for several years. These\r\nducal incomes and the vaster sums accumulated as undivided profits\r\nmade themselves visible in the progressive _embonpoint_ of the\r\ncapitalization. In the six years (1876-81) preceding their taking the\r\nveil as trustees their net earnings added up the total of $55,000,000.\r\nIn the next six years (to 1888) the dividends alone--not the net\r\nearnings--were more than $50,000,000.[657] These did not absorb their\r\nprofits. In one year they spent $8,000,000 out of their profits for\r\nconstruction, besides making the regular payments to stockholders.[658]\r\n\r\n\"All this vast wealth,\" the New York Legislature said, \"is the growth\r\nof about twenty years; this property has more than doubled in value\r\nin six years, and with this increase the trust has made aggregate\r\ndividends during that period of over $50,000,000. It is one of the\r\nmost active,\" the report continued, \"and possibly the most formidable\r\nmoneyed power on this continent.\"[659]\r\n\r\n\"This is an immense property,\" says the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission,\" ... and it gives an immense power which is capable of\r\nbeing so employed as to put all competitors at a great and perhaps\r\nruinous disadvantage.\"[660]\r\n\r\nFor the first time the New York investigation of 1888 revealed that it\r\nwas only the beginning of the truth that these hundreds of millions\r\nwere controlled by \"trustees.\" It now became known that some one or\r\nmore of the trustees owned personally more than half of every concern\r\nin the trust, and of the best ones owned all.\r\n\r\n\"These eight trustees control all these ninety millions of property\r\nscattered over the United States?\" the president of the trust was asked.\r\n\r\n\"They have as trustees, and they have as individual owners both.\"[661]\r\n\r\nIn corroboration of this testimony the trust furnished the New York\r\nSenate Committee of 1888 a \"list of corporations, the stocks of which\r\nare wholly or partially held by the trustees of the Standard Oil\r\nTrust.\" In this list, under the head of \"New York State,\" appears\r\nthis: \"Capital stock, $5,000,000. Standard Oil Company of New York,\r\nmanufacturers of petroleum products. Standard Oil Trust ownership,\r\nentire.\"[662] But when the company was threatened with the forfeiture\r\nof its charter by the proceedings before the Attorney-General in May,\r\n1894, its president made oath as follows: \"The Standard Oil Company of\r\nNew York never permitted its stock to be transferred to trustees.\"[663]\r\n\r\nEven this ownership by eight men is not the whole of the truth. The\r\neight trustees have a ruling power within themselves. An examination of\r\nthe personnel of the board at the beginning, middle, and end of its\r\ncareer as a board shows four men always there. This agrees with the\r\nremark reported in the press to have been made by the solicitor of the\r\ntrust upon its ostensible dissolution in 1892: \"A majority of the stock\r\nbeing held by four men.\"\r\n\r\nA friendly journal, the New York _Sun_, of April 25, 1889, in an\r\neditorial paragraph concerning the wealth of one of the trustees, said:\r\n\"His regular income is twenty millions of dollars a year. That makes\r\nhim the richest man in the United States--perhaps the very richest in\r\nthe world.\" This is nearly three times the dividends paid in 1892 to\r\nall its stockholders by the Bank of England. The Bank of England has\r\nbuilt up this earning power by two hundred years' work at the head of\r\nthe finances of the greatest empire of history. This American wins\r\nthrice its dividend capability in less than a generation by contriving\r\nand managing an institution which he says does not do any business.\r\nAnother entirely friendly paper, with sources of information of the\r\nvery best, put his income two years later at $30,000,000 a year.[664]\r\nNo denial of the _Sun's_ statement was attempted, and the _Sun_ never\r\nwithdrew or modified its figures. Shortly after the secretary of the\r\ntrust gave, in a public interview, a statement of the income of its\r\nprincipal members. That of one of them he put at $9,000,000 a year; his\r\nown at $3,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis wealth is as much too vast for the average arithmetical\r\ncomprehension as the size of the dog-star, 400 times larger than the\r\nsun. These incomes are sums which their fortunate owners could not\r\ncount as they received them. If they did nothing but stand all day at\r\nthe printing-presses of the Treasury Department while the millions\r\ncame uncrinkled out in crisp one-dollar greenbacks, or worked only at\r\ncatching the new dollars as they rolled out from the dies of the Mint,\r\nthey could not count them. If they worked eight hours a day, and six\r\ndays a week, and fifty-two weeks in the year, they could not count\r\ntheir money. The dollars would come faster than their fingers could\r\ncatch them; the dollars would slip out of their clutch and fall to the\r\nfloor, and, piling up and up, would reach their knees, their middle,\r\ntheir arms, their mouth, and Midas would be snuffed out in his own gold.\r\n\r\nCommodore Vanderbilt, Parton tells us, was forty-four years old before\r\nhe was worth $400,000. In the next thirty years he increased this to\r\nover $100,000,000--perhaps twice that; no one knows. Vanderbilt had\r\nto multiply this nest-egg of his forty-fourth year 250 times, but one\r\nof these \"trustees\" will be a billionaire when he has turned himself\r\nover only ten times. Poor's _Railroad Manual_ shows these men and their\r\nassociates to be presidents or directors in thousands of miles of\r\nrailroads, valued at hundreds of millions. Their names were prominent\r\nin the railroad \"deal\" of 1892 and 1893, which had for its end to put\r\nthe whole of New England under one hand, controlling both its land\r\nand water connections with the rest of the country. They stand at the\r\nreceipt of custom at the railroad gates to the oil regions; to the\r\ncoal-fields of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Illinois;\r\nthe copper, gold, and silver mines of the West; the iron mines of the\r\nWest and South; the turpentine forests and the lumber regions and\r\ncotton fields; the food-producing areas of the Mississippi basin; the\r\ngrazing lands of the plains. They are owners in the principal steamship\r\nline between America and Europe, and in the \"whalebacks,\" which appear\r\ndestined to drive other models out of the freight traffic of the lakes,\r\nand have begun to appear on the Eastern and Western oceans, to capture\r\nthe carrying business of the world. Every dollar for the construction\r\nof a State building at the World's Fair was advanced by one of them, as\r\nthe principal journal of the State announced, and it referred to him as\r\n\"the man who breathes life into its East coast towns, and the lifting\r\nof his pen by his hand is like turning upsidedown the horn of plenty.\"\r\nThey are \"in\" the best things--telegraphs, the gas supply of our large\r\ncities, street-railways, steel mills, ship-yards, Canadian and American\r\niron mines, town sites. Ore dug out of their own iron mines at the\r\nhead of Lake Superior is carried over their own railroad to their own\r\nfurnaces and mills. It rolls along until that which began to move as\r\nore lies at the docks of their ship-yards as a finished vessel, cut\r\nout of the mountains, as it were, at one cheap stroke, or is loaded in\r\nthe cars in some perfected shape of steel, as steam radiators or what\r\nnot. They feed entire mountain ranges into their mills with one hand,\r\nand with the other despatch the product in their own cars and ships to\r\nall markets. Betrayal, bankruptcy, broken hearts, and death have kept\r\nquick step with the march of the conquerors in iron as in oil. They\r\nare in the combination in anthracite coal, with which the acquisition\r\nby an American syndicate of the Nova Scotia coal deposits is closely\r\nconnected. Theirs is the largest share in the natural-gas business\r\nin Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, Indiana, Illinois. They are in the\r\ncombination which controls lead, from pig to white lead, and turpentine\r\nand linseed-oil and paints.\r\n\r\n\"Its members,\" it was said in the application to the Attorney-General\r\nof New York, in 1894, for a forfeiture of one of their charters, \"are\r\nnow presidents and directors in 33,000 miles of road, one-fifth of the\r\ntotal mileage in the United States. Its surplus is invested in banking,\r\nin natural and manufacturing gas companies, in iron ore beds and coal\r\nbeds and crude-oil production, in lead and zinc, in turpentine and\r\ncotton-seed oil, in steel, in jute manufacture, in ocean steamships, in\r\npalatial hotels, in street-railroads.\"\r\n\r\nMost of their interests are in public functions, railroads, pipe lines,\r\ntelegraphs, postal contracts, steamers, municipal franchises, and the\r\nlike; but it is impossible to know their full extent with our present\r\ncrude means for enforcing the truth that property is power and that\r\ncivilization endures no irresponsible anonymous power. The corporation\r\nis an agency by which the capitalist can do business in ambuscade.\r\n\"They are all in our company,\" said the manager of a very important\r\npublic agency, \"but their names do not appear.\" It is not out of\r\ndeference to the obsolete idea that such matters are private business\r\nthat all the details of their possessions are not given, but only\r\nbecause they are not known.\r\n\r\n\"There is no such thing as extemporaneous acquisition,\" Daniel Webster\r\nsaid; but he spoke of eloquence, not of the perfected modern commerce.\r\nSelligue, the French genius to whose discoveries nothing of equal\r\nimportance has been added, is not dignified with an entry in the\r\nencyclopædias or biographical dictionaries. For \"Colonel\" Drake, who\r\nstruck oil, a pension had to be provided by his friends in the regions\r\nwhich he had filled with fountains of wealth. Mr. Van Syckel, who first\r\nproved the pipe line to be practicable, died in Buffalo, paralytic,\r\nhelpless, and poor.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of oil\" could not have come without the oil well and the drill\r\nand derrick, and these in America are the lineal descendants of the\r\nfirst salt well, drilled and whittled out of the rocks by the Ruffner\r\nbrothers, in 1806, in the \"Great Buffalo Lick\" of the Kanawha. Their\r\nfirst \"drill\" was a great sycamore-tree, four feet through, hollowed\r\nout, set on end on the ground in the lick, and gradually lowered as\r\nthe earth and stone within were dug away by a man inside. When they\r\ncame to the rock, which they could not blast because it was under\r\nwater, they hung a roughly-made iron drill by a rope to a spring pole\r\nand went inch by inch through the rock, \"kicking down\" the well. Metal\r\ntubes were not to be had, but the Yankee whittler solved the problem\r\nof tubing the well. Two slender strips of wood were whittled into two\r\nlong, thin, half tubes, and tied together. This is the genesis of the\r\nbored \"well\" and the \"drill and derrick.\"[665] It took eighteen months\r\nto accomplish this, but the wonder is that it was done at all \"without\r\npreliminary study, previous experience or training, without precedent,\r\nin a newly-settled country without steam-power, machine-shop, skilled\r\nmechanics, suitable tools or materials.\"\r\n\r\nThese almost-forgotten men, shrewd, patient, undauntable, were the\r\npioneers of the skilful well-borers who have gone forth from the\r\nKanawha wells all over the country to bore wells for irrigation on\r\nthe Western plains, for cities, factories, and private use, for salt,\r\nfor gas, for geological and mineralogical explorations, and for\r\noil. \"Billy Morris,\" of the Kanawha borings, invented a tool simple\r\nenough, but not so simple as to be described here, called the \"slips\"\r\nor \"jars,\" which has done more for deep boring than anything except\r\nthe steam-engine, and for which, considering the part played in the\r\nlife of man by oil, gas, water, brine, and other wells, we are told\r\nhe \"deserves to be ranked with the inventors of the sewing-machine,\r\nreaper, and cotton-gin.\"[666] But \"Uncle Billy\" made a free gift to the\r\nwell-diggers of the world of his invaluable \"slips,\" and slipped into\r\npoverty and an unknown grave. To Joshua Merrill, more than to any one\r\nelse, belongs the honor of bringing the manufacture of oil in America\r\nto its perfection.[667] He made better oil than any one else, and he\r\nloved his work. \"I was thirty-two years in the oil business. It was\r\nthe business of my life.\"[668] But he had to dismantle his refinery,\r\nand join the melancholy procession of two thousand years of scouts,\r\ninventors, pioneers, capitalists, and toilers who march behind the\r\nsuccessful men.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to say, these successful men did not discover the oil,\r\nnor how to \"strike\" it. They were not the lucky owners of oil lands.\r\nAs late as 1888 they produced only 200 barrels a day--about 1 in every\r\n3000--\"an infinitesimal amount,\" their president said.[669] They did\r\nnot invent any of the processes of refining. They did not devise the\r\npipe line, and they did all they could to prevent the building[670]\r\nof the first pipe line to the seaboard, and to cripple the successful\r\nexperiment of piping refined oil.[671] They own all the important\r\nrefineries, and yet they have built very few. They did not project\r\nthe tank-car system, which came before them,[672] and have used their\r\nirresistible power to prevent its general use on the railroads, and\r\nsuccessfully.[673] They were not the first to enter the field in any\r\ndepartment. They did not have as great capital or skill as their\r\ncompetitors.[674] They began their career in the wrong place--at\r\nCleveland--out of the way of the wells and the principal markets,\r\nnecessitating several hundred miles more of transportation for all of\r\ntheir product that was marketed in the East or Europe.[675] They had\r\nno process of refining oil which others had not, and no legitimate\r\nadvantages over others.[676] They did not even invent the rebate. They\r\nmade oil poor[677] and scarce[678] and dear.[679]\r\n\r\nThe power to chalk down daily on the black-board of the New York\r\nProduce Exchange the price at which people in two hemispheres shall buy\r\ntheir light has followed these strokes of \"cheapness\":\r\n\r\n1. Freight rates to the general public have been increased, often to\r\ndouble and more what is paid by a favored few.[680]\r\n\r\n2. The construction has been resisted of new lines of transportation by\r\nrail,[681]\r\n\r\n3. And pipe.[682] This has been done by litigation,[683] by influence,\r\nby violence,[684] even to the threatened use of cannon,[685] and by\r\nlegislation, as in Ohio and Pennsylvania, to prevent the right of\r\neminent domain from being given by \"free pipe-line bills\" to the people\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n4. The cost of pipeage has been raised.[686]\r\n\r\n5. Rivers and canals have been closed.[687]\r\n\r\n6. Oil has been made to run to waste on the ground.[688]\r\n\r\n7. The outflow of oil from the earth has been shut down.[689]\r\n\r\n8. The outflow of human energy that sought to turn it to human use has\r\nbeen shut down by restricting the manufacture by the combination and by\r\nothers, by contract,[690] dismantling,[691] and explosion.[692]\r\n\r\n9. High fees have been maintained for inspection,[693] and the\r\ninspectors have been brought into equivocal relations with the\r\nmonopoly.[694]\r\n\r\n10. The general use of tank-cars and tank-steamers has been\r\nprevented.[695]\r\n\r\n11. The people have been excluded from the free and equal use of the\r\ndocks, storehouses, and other terminal facilities of the railroads in\r\nthe great harbors of export.[696]\r\n\r\n12. Inventors and their better processes have been smothered.[697]\r\n\r\n13. Men have been paid more for spying than they could earn by\r\nworking.[698]\r\n\r\n14. \"Killing delay\" has been created in the administration of\r\njustice.[699]\r\n\r\nAll are poorer--oil-producers, land-owners, all labor, all the\r\nrailroads, all the refiners, merchants, all the consumers of oil--the\r\nwhole people. Less oil has flowed, less light shone, and there has\r\nbeen less happiness and virtue. In every one of the few intervals,\r\nsays Hudson, during which oil could flow freely to Pittsburg, all the\r\nbusinesses connected with it were active and expanding.[700]\r\n\r\nWhen the trust's secretary was asked for the proper name of the\r\ncombination, his reply was: \"The Lord only knows; I don't.\" \"An\r\nindescribable thing,\" he said again.[701]\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand the practical work of refining as a refiner?\" he was\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"I do not.... I have not been inside a refinery in ten years.\"[702]\r\n\r\n\"Two mills a ton a mile for five hundred miles would be a dollar a ton?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not able to demonstrate that proposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have some arithmetical knowledge?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot answer that question.\"[703]\r\n\r\nHe could not state what proportion of the oil trade is now controlled\r\nby the trust. He had never looked into that question. He did not know\r\nwho knows these things.[704]\r\n\r\n\"You own the pipe line to New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it cost you to do business on that pipe line?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know anything about it.... I have never been in the oil\r\nregions but once in my life.... I am not a practical oil man.... For\r\nperhaps eight years I have given absolutely no attention to the details\r\nof our business.\"[705]\r\n\r\nAsked upon another occasion, before the Pennsylvania Legislature, about\r\nthe accounts of the company when he was its secretary, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I am not familiar with the accounts.\"[706]\r\n\r\n\"I am a clamorer for dividends. That is the only function I have,\" said\r\nanother trustee.[707]\r\n\r\n\"When was your last rate given you, the rate at which you are now being\r\ncarried (on the New York Central)?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not tell.\"[708]\r\n\r\nThe secretary had testified that this associate attended to getting the\r\nrates of freight; but the latter avowed that he could not remember \"any\r\nrate\" that he had paid \"at any time.\" But a little later he who could\r\nnot remember any rate he had ever paid was able to tell the committee,\r\noff-hand, the exact rate of freight on oil by steamer from Batoum in\r\nRussia to Liverpool, and knew the rate from the wells at Baku by rail\r\nto the sea at Batoum![709]\r\n\r\n\"Had you ever been interested in the refinery of oil in any manner when\r\nyou first became connected with the oil business?\" another trustee was\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or the production of oil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a railroad man, and had been taken into the combination for his\r\nvalue as such; but when he was asked if he could tell any of the rates\r\nof freight his company had paid, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot.\"[710]\r\n\r\n\"What is your business and where do you reside?\" another of the\r\ntrustees was asked by the State of New York.\r\n\r\n\"I decline to answer any question until I can consult counsel.\"[711]\r\n\r\n\"What is the capital stock?\" was asked of another.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much has the capital been increased since?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are the meetings of the Standard Oil Company held?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many directors are there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they own any pipe lines?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about the rates of transportation.\"[712]\r\n\r\n\"What quantity of oil was exported by the different concerns with which\r\nyou were connected from the port of New York in 1881?\" the president\r\nwas asked.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many millions of barrels of oil were refined by such concerns in\r\nthe vicinity of New York in 1881?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how much was refined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did not the concern with which you were so connected purchase over\r\n8,000,000 barrels of crude petroleum in 1881?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am unable to state.\"\r\n\r\nHe was asked to give the name of one refinery in this country, running\r\nat the time (1883), not owned or substantially controlled by his\r\nconcern. \"I decline to answer.\"[713]\r\n\r\nHe was asked if he would say the total profits of his trust's companies\r\nfor the last year (1887) were not as much as $20,000,000.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the least knowledge on that subject.\"[714]\r\n\r\nPhrenologists are right. Memory is not to be ranked with the mental\r\nattributes of the highest importance. The head of the New York Central\r\ncould not tell when a stock dividend of something like $46,000,000 had\r\nbeen declared on one of his railroads--and a $46,000,000 dividend is\r\nsomething worth remembering. \"I don't know.... I don't remember.\"[715]\r\nIt is lucky for the rest of us that these great men forget something.\r\n\r\nOne of the chiefs of the oil combination was a witness in Cleveland in\r\n1887 in a suit by the State of Ohio against certain railroads.\r\n\r\n\"What business in connection with the oil business is done in the\r\nbuilding in which the oil trust has its office in New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think I could state just what business is done in that\r\nbuilding, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\nAsked on the witness-stand in the Buffalo explosion case when it was he\r\nformed the \"trust\" with $70,000,000 of capital, the president replied:\r\n\"I am unable to state,\" and he could not say where its articles of\r\nagreement were, nor who has control of it. When questioned before the\r\nInterstate Commission he could not tell within $25,000,000 how much\r\nbusiness they were doing a year.[716]\r\n\r\nThese men keep no books. The whole arrangement is just a happy family,\r\nlike Barnum's monkeys, birds, cats, dogs, and mice in the same\r\ncage. \"It is a business of faith,\" one of the ruling four puts it.\r\nAnother was asked about the by-laws under which he and his associates\r\ntransacted their business. \"I don't know that I have seen a copy,\" he\r\nreplied, and as to where it was he was able only to \"suppose.\"[717]\r\n\r\nWhen the committee of the Legislature called for the books recording\r\nthe transactions of the trust and its attorneys and committees, there\r\nwere practically none to produce. All there was in the way of a record\r\nof transactions of a magnitude beyond those of any other commercial\r\ninstitution in this country or the world were a few pages of formal\r\nentries from which nothing could be learned. The executive committee\r\nreceived and passed upon the disbursements of money by the treasurer,\r\nand the reports of sub-committees and of members, who had sweeping\r\npowers of attorney, by which these countless millions were kept rolling\r\nthemselves up into more, but it never kept any records.\r\n\r\n\"I have no knowledge of any formal record having been made,\" one of\r\nthem said. The reports were \"either verbal or on pieces of paper....\r\nI think it was memorandums,\" he continued, and the memorandums were\r\n\"undoubtedly destroyed.\" They were transcribed into the records of the\r\ntrustees, he said, but the search of the committee showed that the\r\ntranscription was a \"skeleton,\" consisting mainly of the mere phrase,\r\n\"Minutes of the executive committee approved.\" \"The real minutes do not\r\nappear upon the book,\" Senator Ives, of the committee, said.\r\n\r\n\"There is no book to produce?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no book.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there is no memorandum?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no memorandum.\"[718]\r\n\r\n\"Does the trust keep books?\" the \"president\" was asked by Congress.\r\n\r\n\"No, we have no system of book-keeping.\"\r\n\r\nOn further pressure he said that the treasurer had \"a record to know\r\nwhat money comes in.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have never seen those books?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think I have ever seen those books.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has any member of the nine\" (trustees) \"ever seen those books?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know that they have.\"[719]\r\n\r\nSimplicity is said to be always a characteristic of greatness. What\r\ncould be simpler, and so greater, than this? The elements of success\r\nare only--\r\n\r\n1. Not to know anything about the business.\r\n\r\n2. To keep no books.\r\n\r\n3. To have \"a record to know what money comes in,\" and\r\n\r\n4. Never to look at it.\r\n\r\nFinally, the operations of these men have, in their own language, not\r\nbeen \"business.\" Its secretary told Congress that the \"trust\" was \"not\r\na business corporation,\"[720] and an associate declared in court that\r\nit \"cannot do business.\" The report of the New York Legislature shows\r\nthat on October 3, 1883, the president had by a formal instrument been\r\nmade the attorney of the trust to sign and execute all the contracts\r\nmade by it. The same instrument in express terms confirmed the\r\nexecution of contracts heretofore signed by him, showing that he had\r\nbeen making contracts.[721]\r\n\r\n\"Those gentlemen\" (the members of the trust who hold its power of\r\nattorney) \"do actually execute contracts involving pretty large\r\namounts, sometimes without a formal resolution of the Board of\r\nTrustees, do they not?\" one of them was asked.\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly they do.\"[722]\r\n\r\nFollowing their employers, the lawyers in the Pennsylvania Tax case for\r\nthe oil combination argued that its operations were not business within\r\nthe meaning of the tax law. If the \"no money\" of 1862 has become the\r\ncontrol, in one industry alone, of $160,000,000 in 1892 by methods that\r\nare not \"business,\" what are they?\r\n\r\n NOTE.--The principal members of the oil combination were heard\r\n at great length in its defence before the committee of Congress\r\n investigating trusts in 1888.[723] Their testimony has been frequently\r\n used in our pages. But they felt that their case needed further\r\n elucidation, and asked the committee to hear them again. The committee\r\n declined to hear them again \"explain or contradict,\" as they offered\r\n to do, but by printing their communication gave them the benefit of\r\n their denials and explanations.[724] Their offer was mainly to go\r\n again over the ground that the \"South Improvement Company never did\r\n any business,\" that the combination \"obtained no preferences\" on the\r\n railroads, that they had cheapened transportation, improved machinery,\r\n made better oil at less cost, and so on. The chief officers and owners\r\n had been heard on all these points to the extent of hundreds of pages\r\n of testimony. But though it did not recall them to the witness-stand,\r\n the committee, in addition to printing their communication, printed\r\n most of the documentary evidence they desired to submit. This covered\r\n nearly two hundred pages more.[725]\r\n\r\n The examination, which any one can make, of this record discloses an\r\n interesting fact concerning the proof, and the trust's offer to prove,\r\n which can best be shown in parallel columns:\r\n\r\n\r\n        TRUST'S OFFER TO PROVE.      |             THE PROOF.\r\n                                     |\r\n It offered the evidence of the third|But the testimony of this witness\r\n vice-president of the Pennsylvania  |states that his connection with\r\n Railroad to \"show the South         |the oil business of the Pennsylvania\r\n Improvement Company never did any   |Railroad--the principal railroad in\r\n business, and its charter was       |that scheme--did not begin until\r\n repealed in 1872.\"                  |1873.[726]\r\n                                     |\r\n It offered the same evidence to     |But this witness stated that his\r\n prove that the same rebates granted |road would give other shippers as\r\n it by the contract of October 17,   |low rates as to the oil combination,\r\n 1877, \"were also granted to every   |\"if they would guarantee the same\r\n shipper who contracted to do _all_  |quantity--not otherwise--under that\r\n his business over the Pennsylvania  |contract\";[727] and the contract\r\n Railroad.\"                          |itself states that no other shipper\r\n                                     |should have the same rebate\r\n                                     |--\"commission,\" it is called--unless\r\n                                     |his business gave the road \"the same\r\n                                     |amount of profit you realized from\r\n                                     |our trade.\"[728] No shipper could get\r\n                                     |the same rates by giving \"all his\r\n                                     |business.\" He must give \"the same\r\n                                     |quantity\"--a totally different\r\n                                     |proposition.\r\n                                     |\r\n It offered the evidence taken in the|The evidence shows that this was\r\n Buffalo Explosion case, to show that|what was sworn to: \"I have now a\r\n \"C.B.

Many more instances could be given, but\r\n more than one instance is not needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE SMOKELESS REBATE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith searching intelligence, indomitable will, and a conscience which\r\nmakes religion, patriotism, and the domestic virtues but subordinate\r\nparagraphs in a ritual of money worship, the mercantile mind flies\r\nits air-line to business supremacy. That entirely modern social\r\narrangement--the private ownership of public highways--has introduced a\r\nnew weapon into business warfare which means universal dominion to him\r\nwho will use it with an iron hand.\r\n\r\nThis weapon is the rebate, smokeless, noiseless, invisible, of\r\nextraordinary range, and the deadliest gun known to commercial warfare.\r\nIt is not a lawful weapon. Like the explosive bullet, it is not\r\nrecognized by the laws of war. It has to be used secretly. All the\r\nrates he got were a secret between himself and the railroads. \"It has\r\nnever been otherwise,\" testified one of the oil combination.[731] The\r\nChevalier Bayard declared proudly, as he lay on his death-bed, that he\r\nhad never given quarter to any one so degraded and unknightly as to\r\nuse gunpowder. Every one would close in at once to destroy a market\r\ncombatant who avowed that he employed this wicked projectile.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus of the rebate is so simple that it looks less like a\r\ndestroying angel than any weapon of offence ever known. The whole\r\nbattery consists only of a pen and ink and some paper. The discharge is\r\nbut the making of an entry--but the signing of a check. But when the\r\nman who commands this simple enginery directs it against a business\r\ncompetitor you can follow the track of wreckage like the path of a\r\ncyclone, by the ruins which lie bleaching in the air for years. The\r\ngentlemen who employ it give no evidence of being otherwise engaged\r\nthan in their ordinary pursuits. They go about sedate and smiling, with\r\nseemingly friendly hands empty of all tools of death. But all about\r\nthem as they will, as if it were only by wish of theirs which attendant\r\nspirits hastened to execute, rivals are blown out of the highways, busy\r\nmills and refineries turn to dust, hearts break, and strong men go mad\r\nor commit suicide or surrender their persons and their property to the\r\nskilful artillerists.\r\n\r\n\"And in the actual practice of daily life,\" says Ruskin, \"you will find\r\nthat wherever there is secrecy, there is either guilt or danger.\" \"When\r\ndid you discover the fact that these rebates had been paid?\" one of the\r\nvictims was asked.\r\n\r\n\"We never discovered it as a fact until the testimony was taken in\r\n1879.... We always suspected it; but we never knew of it of our\r\npersonal knowledge, and never would really have known it of our\r\npersonal knowledge.... I had no idea of the iniquity that was going\r\non.\"[732]\r\n\r\nNothing so demolishing was ever so delicate and intangible as this, for\r\nits essence is but a union of the minds of a railroad official and some\r\nbusiness friend, perhaps a silent partner, bent on business empire. The\r\nmodel merchant, fortunate in having a friend willing so to use a power\r\nsovereigns would not dare to use, walks the public way, strong in his\r\nsecret, and smiles with triumph as all at whom he levels his invisible\r\nwand sicken and disappear. \"He has the receipt of fern-seed. He walks\r\ninvisible.\"\r\n\r\nMen who hunt their fellow-men with this concealed weapon always deny\r\nit, as they must. To use it has always been a sin, and has been made a\r\ncrime in every civilized State. Under United States law it is, since\r\n1887, an offence punishable with imprisonment in the penitentiary.[733]\r\nMoral ideals are not born in legislatures. When an act attains by a\r\nlaw the distinction of being made a crime, it is already well on its\r\nway to extinction. It is made infamous by law, because it has already\r\nbecome infamous before the conscience and honor of men. It was not the\r\nprohibition of highway privilege by the Constitution of Pennsylvania or\r\nthe laws of the United States which made the rebate an iniquity. This\r\nlegal volley is but a salute to the established conscience.\r\n\r\nThe question most often pressed before all the many legislative and\r\njudicial inquests held upon the dead bodies which strew every field of\r\nthe oil industry has been whether the extraordinary powers which the\r\ninvention of the locomotive and the transformation of public highways\r\ninto private property had given railways over the livelihoods of the\r\npeople had been used to make it impossible for any but a preferred few\r\nto live.\r\n\r\nOne of the successful men disposed of the evidence that these powers\r\nhad been so used by styling it before the committee of Congress of\r\n1888 as the \"worst balderdash,\" and before the New York Legislative\r\nCommittee of 1888 as \"irresponsible newspaper statements,\" \"a malignity\r\nand mendacity that is little short of devilishness.\" The secretary of\r\nthe oil trust waved it away as \"all this newspaper talk and flurry.\"\r\nThe president knows nothing about the existence of such privileges,\r\nexcept that he has \"heard much of it in the papers.\" And yet another of\r\nthe trust in the _North American Review_ of February, 1883, similarly\r\ndescribes the accusation as \"uncontradicted calumny,\" to which, he\r\nregrets to say, \"several respectable journals and magazines lent\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nAfter taking 3700 pages of evidence and sitting for months, the\r\ncommittee of 1879 of the New York Legislature said in their report:\r\n\"The history of this corporation is a unique illustration of the\r\npossible outgrowth of the present system of railroad management in\r\ngiving preferential rates, and also showing the colossal proportions to\r\nwhich monopoly can grow under the laws of this country.[734] ... The\r\nparties whom they have driven to the wall have had ample capital and\r\nequal ability in the prosecution of their business in all things save\r\ntheir ability to acquire facilities for transportation.\"[735]\r\n\r\nThe committee of the Ohio Legislature which took the evidence of the\r\ntreatment of the Marietta independents by the railroads[736] is, so far\r\nas the author knows, the only body of all the legislative and judicial\r\ntribunals that have been investigating for the past thirty years which\r\nhas found the relations of the railroads and the oil combination to\r\nbe proper. It used the words \"public,\" \"uniform,\" \"in accordance\r\nwith law,\" \"equitable,\" \"no special discriminations or privileges\"\r\nto describe the conduct of the common carriers in that case. But in\r\ndoing so it had to except from these exculpations the railroad which\r\noriginated the attack on the independent refiners, and the rates of\r\nwhich controlled the others, as it was the initial road. It had also\r\nto admit that the oil combination had received \"better rates,\" but\r\ndefended them on the ground that its shipments were larger. These two\r\nexceptions are doors wide enough to admit every possibility of the\r\nrebate. The Secretary of State for Internal Affairs of Pennsylvania\r\nmade an investigation in 1878 on the complaint of citizens. He reported\r\nto the Attorney-General that no case had been made out \"beyond the\r\nordinary province of individual redress.\" He was hung in effigy by\r\nthe citizens, and the evidence he took remains, like that of the Ohio\r\nCommittee of 1879, a valuable repository of facts from which students\r\ncan draw their own conclusions.\r\n\r\nMore than any others the wrongs of the oil industry provoked the\r\ninvestigations by Congress from 1872 to 1887, and caused the\r\nestablishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and more than\r\nany others they have claimed the attention of the new law and the\r\nnew court. The cases brought before it cover the oil business on\r\npractically every road of any importance in the United States--in\r\nNew England, the Middle States, the West, the South, the Pacific\r\ncoast; on the great East and West trunk roads--the Pennsylvania, the\r\nErie, the Baltimore and Ohio, the New York Central, and all their\r\nallied lines; on the transcontinental lines--the Union Pacific,\r\nthe Central Pacific, the Southern Pacific; on the steamship and\r\nrailroad association controlling the South and Southwest. They show\r\nthat from ocean to ocean, and from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, wherever the American citizen seeks an opening in\r\nthis industry, he finds it, like the deer forests and grouse moors\r\nof the old country, protected by game-keepers against him and the\r\ncommon herd. The terms in which the commission have described the\r\npreferences given the oil combination are not ambiguous: \"Great\r\ndifference in rates,\" \"unjust discrimination,\" \"intentional disregard\r\nof rights,\" \"unexcused,\" \"a vast discrepancy,\" \"enormous,\" \"illegal,\"\r\n\"excessive,\"[737] \"extraordinary,\" \"forbidden by the act to regulate\r\ncommerce,\"[738] \"so obvious and palpable a discrimination that no\r\ndiscussion of it is necessary,\" \"wholly indefensible,\" \"patent and\r\nprovoking discriminations for which no rational excuse is suggested,\"\r\n\"obnoxious,\" \"disparity ... absurd and inexcusable,\" \"gross\r\ndisproportions and inequalities,\"[739] \"long practised,\" \"the most\r\nunjust and injurious discrimination ... and this discrimination inured\r\nmostly to the benefit of one powerful combination.\"[740]\r\n\r\nThis was what the Interstate Commerce Commission found all along the\r\nrecord from 1887 to 1893. When one of those who got the benefits so\r\ncharacterized was before the New York Legislature in 1888, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I know of no discrimination in the oil traffic of any kind since the\r\npassage of the Interstate Commerce Act.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you use any means for the purpose of avoiding the effect of that\r\nnew law?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever.\"[741]\r\n\r\nBut the people have found that the explicit prohibitions of the\r\nInterstate Commerce law were of no more protection to them than\r\nthe equally explicit prohibitions given long before by the State\r\nconstitutions and laws, the common law of the court, and by the still\r\nolder common law of right, which the statute was created to enforce.\r\nThe \"unjust,\" \"enormous,\" \"illegal\" differences in freights by which\r\nthe public was excluded were got from the railroads after, as before,\r\nCongress, obedient to an aroused and universal demand, had passed a\r\nspecial statute and created a special tribunal to prevent and punish\r\nthis special sort of crime. This is the adjudicated fact.\r\n\r\nThis \"uncontradicted calumny,\" \"worst balderdash,\" \"malignity\r\nand mendacity,\" \"irresponsible newspaper statements\" proves upon\r\nexamination to be:\r\n\r\n1. Testimony of unimpeached and in many cases uncontradicted witnesses,\r\ngiven under oath in legislative investigations and in court, subject to\r\nexamination and cross-examination and rebuttal.\r\n\r\n2. Reports of State legislative committees.\r\n\r\n3. Copies of the contracts.[742]\r\n\r\n4. Decision of courts, State and national.[743]\r\n\r\nThe South Improvement plan of 1872 is still in unrelenting operation,\r\naccording to the latest news. A case is now pending before the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission,[744] in which charges of highway abuse\r\neven more sensational than any of those we have seen judicially proved\r\nare made against the thirty railroads by which the oil of Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, and New York reaches the Pacific coast. A San Francisco\r\noil dealer is the petitioner for relief. He recites the discriminations\r\ngiven the oil combination on the Pacific coast before the Interstate\r\nCommerce law was enacted. These were admitted by the officials of\r\nthe roads before the United States Pacific Railway Commission of\r\n1887. The traffic managers of the Southern Pacific testified that\r\nthe oil combination, \"from the time it acquired the oil business on\r\nthis coast, had lower rates than the general tariff provided, or than\r\nother shippers paid on coal oil.\"[745] The general freight agent of\r\nthe Central Pacific Railroad admitted that his road had the same\r\narrangement, and had accepted the business \"at rates dictated\" by the\r\noil combination.[746] The general traffic manager of the Union Pacific\r\nRailroad said:\r\n\r\n\"We have paid them a good deal in rebates.\" It was a \"pretty large\"\r\npreference.\r\n\r\n\"What was the effect on the small dealer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think it would be embarrassing to the small shipper!\"[747]\r\n\r\nWhen the Interstate Commerce law went into force the oil combination\r\nintroduced a patented car for the transcontinental trade, which\r\nit claimed the sole right to use. Though the new car was to the\r\ndisadvantage of the railroads, as it cost more to haul, the managers\r\ngave it lower rates than any other car and carried it back free, while\r\nthey punished the shippers who gave them a lighter and better car by\r\ncharging them $105 for carrying that back.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco complainant goes on to charge that a plan was\r\nconcocted and put in operation by which rates were lowered whenever the\r\ncombination wanted to fill its warehouses on the Pacific coast, and as\r\nsoon as they were full were put back again. This lowering and raising\r\nof rates was \"to the public sudden and unexpected.\"[748] It was known\r\nin advance only to the ring and the railroads. Before other shippers\r\ncould take advantage of the low rates they would be raised again. The\r\ncomplaint recites that in pursuance of this plan, after the combination\r\nhad transferred to the Pacific coast at the end of 1888 from its\r\nEastern refineries all it needed for the next season's business, the\r\nrailroads advanced the rates from 82-1/2 cents a hundred pounds to\r\n$1.25. The next May the railroads made a similar seesaw, and, he says,\r\nin December, 1892, \"are still making ... such arbitrary and sudden\r\nreductions ... to the undue advantage\" of the oil combination \"and to\r\nthe detriment and injury of all other shippers.\" The San Francisco\r\nmerchant also charges that in the interest of the Eastern refineries\r\nof the combination rates are made to prevent the large product of the\r\noil-fields and independent refineries of Colorado and Wyoming from\r\nreaching the Pacific coast, \"which needs them to furnish fuel for its\r\nmanufactories, as well as for light for its residents.\" Similarly we\r\nfind the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad charging $105 for a car-load\r\nof cattle from Wyoming to Chicago, while for a car of 75 barrels of\r\noil the freight would be $348. In connection with these charges the\r\npress published the telegrams, filling columns, which were said to have\r\npassed between the officials of the railroads and the oil combination\r\nin the negotiation of this arrangement. In one of these telegrams the\r\nfreight agent of the Southern Pacific explains the new deal. \"He\" (the\r\nagent of the oil combination) \"would stock up at the low rate, then\r\nnotify the association of railroads when to advance.\" The advance or\r\ndecline was to be \"made at certain seasons of the year in accordance\r\nwith this supply on hand.\" When the negotiation was finished and the\r\nplan was agreed to, a San Francisco agent of the oil combination is\r\nsaid to have telegraphed to its officers in New York: \"I think we have\r\nmanaged this freight business pretty well from this long distance,\r\nespecially when you think that we have secured the 90-cent rate with\r\nwhich to stock up from time to time.\" His telegram also discloses\r\nthat the arrangement extended to lead and linseed-oil, showing, what\r\nis well known, that the combinations in these articles belong to the\r\nmembers of that in oil. These charges are, it is to be remembered,\r\nstill unadjudicated, this published evidence is not yet substantiated.\r\nBut the arrangement which is charged is in exact pursuance of that\r\npart of the South Improvement Company contract which bound the\r\nrailroads to \"lower or raise the gross rates of transportation ...\r\nfor such times and to such extent as may be necessary to overcome\r\n... competition.\"[749] And Attorney-General Olney has been publicly\r\ninformed[750] that during the summer of 1894 oil rates between\r\nPennsylvania and Colorado were put down from 75 cents a hundred to 25\r\ncents, and a few weeks later raised again to the old rate. Another\r\nincrease made the rates to Denver higher, for oil, than to the Pacific\r\ncoast. He has been asked to ascertain, judicially, if this shuffling\r\nof rates was not made, like that complained of before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, to allow the oil trust \"to stock up at the old\r\nrate.\" His informants suggest that the same powers with which he has\r\nbrought railway employés to trial for infractions of the Interstate\r\nCommerce law can be used against the railways.\r\n\r\nThis is not all of the story. This patented car spoken of was a mere\r\naggregation of old elements, as the courts held, and the patent was\r\nvoid. Advised by their lawyer that this would be the view the courts\r\nwould have to take, competitors of the combination in the business of\r\nthe Pacific coast, where they had been at the head until these new\r\ntricks of trade came in, introduced a car of their own of the same\r\nclass. They thus became entitled to the same low rates and the same\r\nfree return of the car as their powerful rival. This put them again\r\non an equality in transportation. They had not been using these new\r\ncars long before two of them, shipped as usual from the East, failed\r\nto arrive. Their search for the missing cars put them in possession of\r\nthe interesting information that a litigation, of which they had had\r\nno notice or knowledge whatever, had for some time been in progress,\r\nand was at that moment at the point of decision. As their interests\r\nhad been entirely unrepresented, this decision would certainly have\r\nbeen against them, and would have forever made impossible the use of\r\ntheir cars on any railroad of the United States. This had been done\r\nby an apparently hostile litigation by the oil combination against\r\nthe Southern Pacific Railroad. The former sued in the United States\r\ncourts for an injunction to forbid the railroad from hauling the\r\ncars of the competitor, on the ground that they were an infringement\r\non its own patented cars. No notice was given the persons most\r\ninterested--the owners of the cars in question--whose business life\r\nwas involved, and they were not at first made parties to the suit.\r\nThe dummy defendant--the railroad--made no valid opposition, but with\r\ngreat condescension admitted that all the averments of its antagonist\r\nwere true. The case was sent through the courts on a gallop to get\r\na decision. After that the merchants whose cars were the object of\r\nthe attack, as they had not been parties to the case, could not have\r\nit reopened, and it would stand against them without possibility of\r\nreversal. The firm found that a temporary injunction had been applied\r\nfor and had been granted; that this had been followed by proceedings to\r\nmake the injunction perpetual; that subpoenas had been issued, served,\r\nand returned, and an order had been obtained from the court for taking\r\ntestimony. In place of the regular examiner of the court, a special\r\nexaminer had been appointed; he had begun taking evidence the same\r\nday, and taking it privately. The testimony so taken had been sealed\r\nand filed. The railroad had made its answer December 2d, the testimony\r\nalready taken was filed in court December 3d, making the case complete\r\nfor decision by the judges. December 4th the firm heard for the first\r\ntime of what was being done, and December 5th applied for the right to\r\ntake part, which saved them. To get such cases ready for a hearing in\r\nthe United States Circuit Court, where this was done, usually requires\r\na year. But in this instance it was done in two weeks! Only just as\r\nthe door of the court was closing irrevocably, as far as their rights\r\nwere concerned, did the firm get inside, and secure leave to have\r\ntheir side represented. The whole fabric of the litigation fell at the\r\nfirst touch. The temporary injunction against the use of their car was\r\ndissolved, the permanent injunction was refused, the patent of the oil\r\ntrust's car was declared worthless, and this decision was upheld by the\r\nUnited States Circuit Court of Appeals in February, 1893.[751]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile their oil, side-tracked in the Mojave Desert and elsewhere,\r\nwas being cooked to death, their customers were going elsewhere, and\r\nthey were being put to loss and damages which they are now suing to\r\nhave made good to them. \"There are some equivocal circumstances in\r\nthe case,\" said Judge Hoffman, dissolving the injunctions in 1890. He\r\npointed out that the railroad made no objection to the injunction which\r\ndeprived it of business. This \"tends to corroborate suspicions,\" he\r\nsaid, suggested by other features of the case. The railroad persisted\r\nin remaining in the case to the end, after the real parties in interest\r\ncame in, and, although codefendants with these parties, the road\r\nmanoeuvred for the benefit of the other side in a way which the Court\r\nagain said \"had an equivocal appearance.\" The counsel for the firm,\r\nin his brief for the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, pointed\r\nout more causes for \"suspicion.\" He showed the Court that the records\r\nof the case had been mutilated in many places. All the mutilations\r\nwere in favor of the other side of the case. Who was the author of\r\nthe mutilations was not shown, but it was shown that the record had\r\nbeen intrusted by the lower court to a representative of one of the\r\noil trust, to be printed and delivered to the Court of Appeals. \"It\r\nwould be a very easy matter for a vicious attorney,\" said the lawyer\r\nof the independents, \"under such circumstances, to make changes\r\nand alterations in the record that might not be noticed, but would\r\nnevertheless greatly prejudice the case.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the victims of the smokeless rebate used the only property many\r\nof them had left--their right of appeal to courts or Legislature\r\nor executive officials--they were showered with abuse, as people\r\nwith \"private grievances,\"[752] \"strikers and sore-heads,\"\r\n\"black-mailers,\"[753] \"moss-backs,\" ... \"naturally left in the lurch\"\r\n... \"people who came forward with envy and jealousy of the success\"\r\nof the oil combination,[754] \"throttlers,\" \"ravenous wolves,\" \"hoary\r\nold reprobate,\" \"senile old liar,\" \"public till-tapper,\" \"plunderers,\"\r\n\"pestilence.\"[755] Such are a few of the blossoms of rhetoric\r\nwith which those who sought their rights in courts or before the\r\nLegislature have been crowned. These witnesses have come forward all\r\nthrough the period between 1872 and 1892, and from every point of\r\nimportance in the industry--New York, Pittsburg, Cleveland, Oil City,\r\nSan Francisco, Titusville, Philadelphia, Marietta, Buffalo, Boston,\r\nCincinnati, Louisville, Memphis, New Orleans. They have come from every\r\nprovince of the industry--the refineries, the oil fields, the pipe\r\nlines, railroads, the wholesale and retail markets. Bound together\r\nby no common tie of organization or partnership, they have, each and\r\nall, exactly the same kind of story to tell. The substance of their\r\ncomplaint--that one selected knot of men, members of one organization,\r\nwere given, unlawfully, the control of the highways, to the exclusion\r\nand ruin of the people--has been sustained by the evidence taken by\r\nevery official investigation, and by the decision of every court to\r\nwhich the facts have been submitted.\r\n\r\nAs the counsel of the New York Chamber of Commerce before the New York\r\nLegislative Committee of 1879 said: \"Such a power makes it possible to\r\nthe freight agents of the railways to constitute themselves special\r\npartners in every line of business in the United States, contributing\r\nas their share of capital to the business the ability to crush out\r\nrivals.\" Men who can choose which merchants, manufacturers, producers\r\nshall go to market and which stay at home, have a key that will unlock\r\nthe door of every business house on the line; they know the combination\r\nof every safe.\r\n\r\nIn their appeal to the executive of Pennsylvania, the Petroleum\r\nProducers' Union refer to the conduct of the railroad officials as\r\n\"inexplicable upon any ordinary hypothesis, or under any known theory\r\nof railroad politics.\"[756] What the railroad managers did, we know;\r\nwhy they did it, has never been judicially demonstrated. One of the\r\nearliest intimations of the kind of lubricant used was given by the\r\nanti-monopoly leader of the people in the Constitutional Convention\r\nof Pennsylvania of 1872, who is now the legal leader of the oil\r\ncombination. He said: \"I am told that discriminations are now made to\r\nso great an extent as to be ruinous to certain companies unless the\r\nrailroad companies' officers are given a bonus. That is the evil under\r\nwhich we labor. I do not know how to cure it, but it must be cured\r\nsomehow.\" Again he said: \"It is charged--I do not make the charge\r\nmyself--but it is charged upon a railroad company running through the\r\noil regions that it will not, without delay, transport oil delivered to\r\nthe railroad station by the various pipe lines unless it is interested\r\nin the pipe line.... It is said that whenever a new pipe line is\r\nbuilt, it is necessary that somebody connected with the particular\r\nrailroad company shall be presented with stock in the pipe line;\r\notherwise, it (the railroad company) will not furnish cars without\r\ntedious and unnecessary delay. This is a discrimination which should be\r\nstopped.\"[757]\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the purpose of the discrimination was something\r\nmore than to shunt the control of the trade--more than \"to maintain\r\nthe business\" of the favorite. Ten cents a barrel difference would\r\nhave done that, for, as the Supreme Court of Ohio pointed out, that\r\nalone amounted to a tax of 21 per cent. a year on the capital of the\r\n\"outsiders.\"[758] When 10 cents was enough, why was the tax made\r\n22-1/2 cents, 25 cents, 64-1/2 cents up to $1.10?\r\n\r\nSome railroad men are known to have been stockholders in the oil\r\ncombination. \"I think I owned--I guess I had $100,000 in it.... I don't\r\nknow anything at all about it\"--the company--the head of the New York\r\nCentral admitted.[759] Who were the owners of certain shares of their\r\ncapital stock these men have always refused to divulge. In giving in\r\ncourt a list of stockholders of one of their corporations one of the\r\nofficers uncovered only three-quarters of the stock. Who held the other\r\nfourth he avowed he could not say, although the stock-book was in his\r\ncustody.[760] The dividends were paid to the vice-president, and by\r\nhim handed over to these veiled prophets. There was a similar mystery\r\nabout the owners of about $2,000,000 of the National Transit stock, the\r\nconcern which owns and manages the pipe lines. Asked for the names of\r\nthe owners of this portion, the \"secretary\" said:\r\n\r\n\"It is a private matter.... I decline to answer.\"[761]\r\n\r\nThe president of this pipe-line branch also refused to give Congress\r\nthis information.[762] This secrecy will couple itself at once in the\r\nmind of the investigator with the charges just quoted, that railroad\r\nofficials had to be given backsheesh of pipe-line stock before their\r\nroads would carry the oil of the pipe lines.\r\n\r\nThe United States Senate Committee which investigated the cattle and\r\nmeat monopolies had a similar experience. Their report says: \"The\r\nsecretary of the Union Stockyards testified at Chicago that when the\r\ncompany was established the stock was subscribed by the railroads; but\r\nwhen asked to show his stock-books he declined, after consultation with\r\nthe company's attorneys, and persisted in this refusal at Washington\r\nCity. For the purposes of our investigation it was not considered\r\nnecessary to ascertain in whose names the stock now stands, for we\r\nwere satisfied that whatever the ownership it would not appear in the\r\nnames of the railroad presidents, directors, and stockholders, who\r\nare the real owners.... The refusal of the secretary, under direction\r\nof his employers, to make public the list of stockholders must have\r\nbeen because of the fact that the same men own the stockyards and the\r\nrailroads running to them, and they do not propose to submit their\r\nbooks to scrutiny because they dread the truth.... This extraordinary\r\nconduct on the part of the stockyards company is not alone in the chain\r\nof evidence which shows complicity between the stockyards and the\r\nrailroads.\"[763]\r\n\r\nThe smokeless rebate makes the secret of success in business to\r\nbe not manufacture, but manufracture--breaking down with a strong\r\nhand the true makers of things. To those who can get the rebate it\r\nmakes no difference who does the digging, building, mining, making,\r\nproducing the million forms of the wealth they covet for themselves.\r\nThey need only get control of the roads. All that they want of the\r\nwealth of others can be switched off the highways into their hands.\r\nTo succeed, ambitious men must make themselves refiners of freight\r\nrates, distillers of discriminations, owners, not of lands, mines, and\r\nforests--not in the first place, at least--but of the railway officials\r\nthrough whose hands the produce must go to market; builders, not of\r\nmanufactories, but of privileges; inventors only of schemes to keep for\r\nthemselves the middle of the road and both sides of it; contrivers, not\r\nof competition, but of ways to tax the property of their competitors\r\ninto their pockets. They need not make money; they can take it from\r\nthose who have made it.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the processes of business feudalization are moving\r\nmore rapidly to the end than in any other country. In Chicago, the\r\nyoungest of the great cities of the youngest of the great nations,\r\nthere are fewer wholesale dry-goods stores in 1894 for a population of\r\n1,600,000 than there were in 1860 for 112,172. In almost every one of\r\nthe meteoric careers by which a few men in each trade are rising to\r\nsupreme wealth, it will generally be found that to some privilege on\r\nthe railed highways, accomplished by the rebate, is due the part of\r\ntheir rise which is extraordinary. A few cases of great wealth from\r\nthe increased value of land, a few from remarkable inventions like the\r\nsewing-machine, are only exceptions.\r\n\r\nFrom using railroad power to give better rates to the larger man, it\r\nwas an easy step to using it to make a favorite first a larger man,\r\nthen the largest man, and finally the only man in the business. In\r\nmeat and cattle we see men rising from poverty to great wealth. From\r\nbeing competitors, like other men, in the scramble, they get into the\r\ncomfortable seat of control of the prices at which the farmer must sell\r\ncattle, and at which the people must buy meat.[764] Many other men\r\nhad thrift, sobriety, industry, but only these had the rebate, and so\r\nonly these are the \"fittest in the struggle for existence.\" We find a\r\nmerchant prince of the last generation in New York gathering into his\r\nhands a share of the dry-goods business of the country which appears\r\nentirely disproportionate to his ability and energy, great though these\r\nbe. Is his secret a brain so much larger than his competitors' brains\r\nas his business is greater than theirs? The freight agent of the New\r\nYork Central testified that he gave this man a special rate \"to build\r\nup and develop their business.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were languishing and suffering?\"\r\n\r\n\"To a great extent.\"[765]\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said the counsel for the Chamber of Commerce of New York before\r\nthe committee, \"is deliberately making the rich richer and the poor\r\npoorer, by taxing the poor for the benefit of the rich through the\r\ninstrumentality of the freight charge.\"[766]\r\n\r\nThe officials of the Pennsylvania Railroad, by the use of rebates,\r\nhanded over the State of Pennsylvania to three coal-dealers, each of\r\nwhom had his territory, and was supreme in it, as would-be competitors\r\nfound out when they undertook to ship coal into his market. They made\r\na similar division of the iron and steel business. The rebate is the\r\ngolden-rule of the \"gospel of wealth.\" We have already seen that the\r\nsecret of the few corporations which have become the owners of almost\r\nevery acre of the anthracite coal of Pennsylvania was the rebate.[767]\r\n\r\nAlong one of the most important lines out of Chicago grain dealers who\r\nhad been buying and selling in an open market, building elevators,\r\ninvesting capital and life, found five years ago market and railroad\r\nand livelihood suddenly closed to them, and the work of thirty years\r\nbrought to an untimely end. The United States Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, and the United States District Attorneys co-operating with\r\nit, broke down in the attempt to compel the railroad men who gave these\r\nprivileges of transportation, or the business men who received them,\r\nto testify or to produce their books. The United States grand-jury in\r\nChicago, in December, 1890, proceeded against the shippers and the\r\nrailroad men. All of them refused to tell the rates given or received,\r\nor to produce their books.\r\n\r\nWhy do you refuse to answer? they were asked.\r\n\r\nBecause to do so would incriminate us.\r\n\r\nHere, too, would-be successful men have gone gunning with the smokeless\r\nrebate for control of the wheat and corn and all the produce of the\r\nAmerican farmer. Grain is fated to go the way that oil, hard coal,\r\ncattle, and meat have already gone. The farmer may remain the nominal\r\nowner of his farm under these circumstances, but he will be real owner\r\nof nothing but the piece of paper title.\r\n\r\nFirst the product of the farm; then the farm. In America rises the\r\nshadow of a coming land-ownership more concentrated, more cruel, with\r\nthe impersonal cruelty of corporate anonymity, than any the world has\r\nyet seen.\r\n\r\nThe grain broker who becomes, by favor of the general freight agent,\r\nthe sole shipper and warehouseman of grain along a line of railroad,\r\nbecomes thereby the sole buyer, and in the sole buyer of the produce we\r\nhave the fast-growing germ of the future sole buyer of the land.\r\n\r\n\"Petroleum is the victim to-day,\" said the address, in 1872, of the\r\nPetroleum Producers' Union \"to all newspapers and boards of trade\r\nopposing monopoly.... Coal, iron, cotton, breadstuffs, or live-stock\r\nmay be in the grasp of the monopoly to-morrow.\" The prediction is more\r\nthan half fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\"I ran away from home, and went to California,\" said a prominent grain\r\nmerchant to the writer, \"to escape being compelled to testify as to\r\nthe freight rates I was paying. But these decisions that we cannot be\r\nforced to incriminate ourselves give me safe-conduct, and I am going\r\nhome to take all the rebates I can get.\"\r\n\r\nThis is what is going on to-day in the \"division of property\" in\r\nAmerica. Our society is woven together by the steam shuttle that\r\nmoves between its farms and dinner-tables, its cotton-fields and\r\nfactories, thousands of miles apart, and the shuttle is crooked.\r\nOut of $800,000,000 paid yearly in this country for the carriage of\r\nfreight, it was estimated in 1888, by one who knew, that $50,000,000\r\nto $100,000,000 goes to favored shippers.[768] As the result of\r\npersonal examination made as an expert for stockholders, he declared\r\nthat one of the great trunk lines had in the last twenty years thus\r\ndiverted to favorites of the managers $100,000,000 of the money of\r\nthe stockholders. Besides his yachts and trotters, every Captain of\r\nIndustry worth talking about keeps his stud of railway presidents and\r\ngeneral freight agents.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion, as yet only in the gristle in these new questions,\r\nturns upon first one and then another as the author of its\r\ntroubles--the soulless corporation, the combination of corporations,\r\nrailroad oppression, or what not. But the corporation is merely a\r\ncover, the combination of corporations an advantage, the private\r\nownership of public highways an opportunity, and the rebate its perfect\r\ntool. The real actors are men; the real instrument, the control of\r\ntheir fellows by wealth, and the mainspring of the evil is the morals\r\nand economics which cipher that brothers produce wealth when they are\r\nonly cheating each other out of birthrights.\r\n\r\nThe success of the same men in Europe shows that railroad\r\ndiscrimination is not the essence of their power, though it has\r\nin America been the chief instrument. By their wealth and their\r\nwillingness to use it in their way they have become supreme. Supreme\r\neven where, as in England and Germany, they had no such unjust and\r\ncrushing preference on the highways as in America. Back of highway\r\nprivilege, back of money power, back of trade supremacy gained by\r\nthese two means must be reckoned, as the essence of this phenomenon,\r\nthe morality--our morality--which not only allows but encourages men\r\nto do each other to death, provided only the weapon be a bargain and\r\nthe arena a market. \"Everything shall not go to market,\" says Emerson;\r\nbut everything does go to market. The millionaire is the modern hero,\r\nsays the New York _Evening Post_. The men who have found in the rebate\r\nthe secret of business success--and there are more of them than the\r\npublic guesses--have only extended a fiercer hand to the results all\r\nwere aiming at. They have used the smokeless rebate because it was the\r\nbest gun. But if that had not been ready to their hand, they would have\r\ntaken the next best. The course of conquest might have been slower,\r\nbut, unless checked by moral interventions, it would have reached the\r\nsame end. If society is founded on the idea that property belongs to\r\nthe strongest, these will sooner or later get all the property, by\r\nbargains or by battles according to \"the spirit of the age.\"\r\n\r\nThe highest State and national courts and the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission of the United States have sustained the people in the\r\nassertion of their rights, under the law, to come and go with free\r\nand equal rights on the highways. The judges have solemnly warned\r\nthe guilty men that they must give up their \"abhorrent\" attempt to\r\ndrive citizens out of the industries of their choice, and to add the\r\nproperty of the people to their vast estates. Although thus declared\r\nin the right by the highest judges of the law and the fact, the people\r\nare poor, defeated, and unsuccessful. Though thus warned by the\r\nauthoritative voice of the ministers of right and justice that their\r\npurposes and practices are iniquitous and intolerable, the men who have\r\ndetermined that whole provinces of American industry shall be theirs,\r\nand theirs only, continue their warfare of extermination upon poor men\r\nwith methods practically unchanged. They evade or defy the laws of\r\nthe States and of the nation, and the decisions of the courts, State\r\nand national. Guided by the advice of the skilfullest lawyers, they\r\npersist in open violation, or make such changes in their procedure as\r\nwill nullify statute and decision without danger to them. For thirty\r\nyears the independents in the oil regions have had this reinforcement\r\nof the law, and for thirty years, in spite of it, their rights have\r\nbeen defiantly, continuously violated to the common ruin. The people\r\nspend their lives passing about from field or factory, or shop or\r\noffice, to market, from market to court, from court to Legislature,\r\nfrom Legislature to printing-office. They are the type of the time,\r\ndisturbed by the demand of the new tyranny of wealth for tribute from\r\ntheir daily labors, and forbidden to rest until out of their suffering\r\na new liberty has been won--the industrial liberty, for which political\r\nand religious liberty wait for their full realization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE OLD SELF-INTEREST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe corn of the coming harvest is growing so fast that, like the farmer\r\nstanding at night in his fields, we can hear it snap and crackle.\r\nWe have been fighting fire on the well-worn lines of old-fashioned\r\npolitics and political economy, regulating corporations, and leaving\r\ncompetition to regulate itself. But the flames of a new economic\r\nevolution run around us, and we turn to find that competition has\r\nkilled competition, that corporations are grown greater than the\r\nState and have bred individuals greater than themselves, and that the\r\nnaked issue of our time is with property becoming master instead of\r\nservant, property in many necessaries of life becoming monopoly of the\r\nnecessaries of life.\r\n\r\nWe are still, in part, as Emerson says, in the quadruped state. Our\r\nindustry is a fight of every man for himself. The prize we give the\r\nfittest is monopoly of the necessaries of life, and we leave these\r\nwinners of the powers of life and death to wield them over us by the\r\nsame \"self-interest\" with which they took them from us. In all this\r\nwe see at work a \"principle\" which will go into the records as one of\r\nthe historic mistakes of humanity. Institutions stand or fall by their\r\nphilosophy, and the main doctrine of industry since Adam Smith has been\r\nthe fallacy that the self-interest of the individual was a sufficient\r\nguide to the welfare of the individual and society. Heralded as a final\r\ntruth of \"science\" this proves to have been nothing higher than a\r\ntemporary formula for a passing problem. It was a reflection in words\r\nof the policy of the day.\r\n\r\nWhen the Middle Ages landed on the shores of the sixteenth century\r\nthey broke ranks, and for three hundred years every one has been\r\nscurrying about to get what he could. Society was not highly developed\r\nenough to organize the exploration and subjugation of worlds of new\r\nthings and ideas on any broader basis than private enterprise, personal\r\nadventure. People had to run away from each other and from the old\r\nideas, nativities, guilds, to seize the prizes of the new sciences, the\r\nnew land, the new liberties which make modern times. They did not go\r\nbecause the philosophers told them to. The philosophers saw them going\r\nand wrote it down in a book, and have believed themselves ever since to\r\nbe the inventors of the division of labor and the discoverers of a new\r\nworld of social science. But now we are touching elbows again, and the\r\ndream of these picnic centuries that the social can be made secondary\r\nto the individual is being chased out of our minds by the hard light of\r\nthe crisis into which we are waking.\r\n\r\n\"It is a law of business for each proprietor to pursue his own\r\ninterest,\" said the committee of Congress which in 1893 investigated\r\nthe coal combinations. \"There is no hope for any of us, but the\r\nweakest must go first,\" is the golden rule of business.[769] There is\r\nno other field of human associations in which any such rule of action\r\nis allowed. The man who should apply in his family or his citizenship\r\nthis \"survival of the fittest\" theory as it is practically professed\r\nand operated in business would be a monster, and would be speedily\r\nmade extinct, as we do with monsters. To divide the supply of food\r\nbetween himself and his children according to their relative powers of\r\ncalculation, to follow his conception of his own self-interest in any\r\nmatter which the self-interest of all has taken charge of, to deal as\r\nhe thinks best for himself with foreigners with whom his country is at\r\nwar, would be a short road to the penitentiary or the gallows. In trade\r\nmen have not yet risen to the level of the family life of the animals.\r\nThe true law of business is that all must pursue the interest of all.\r\nIn the law, the highest product of civilization, this has long been a\r\ncommonplace. The safety of the people is the supreme law. We are in\r\ntravail to bring industry up to this. Our century of the caprice of the\r\nindividual as the law-giver of the common toil, to employ or disemploy,\r\nto start or stop, to open or close, to compete or combine, has been\r\nthe disorder of the school while the master slept. The happiness,\r\nself-interest, or individuality of the whole is not more sacred than\r\nthat of each, but it is greater. They are equal in quality, but in\r\nquantity they are greater. In the ultimate which the mathematician, the\r\npoet, the reformer projects the two will coincide.\r\n\r\nOur world, operated by individual motive, is the country of the\r\nChinese fable, in which the inhabitants went on one leg. Yes, but an\r\n\"enlightened self-interest\"? The perfect self-interest of the perfect\r\nindividual is an admirable conception, but it is still individual,\r\nand the world is social. The music of the spheres is not to be played\r\non one string. Nature does nothing individually. All forces are\r\npaired like the sexes, and every particle of matter in the universe\r\nhas to obey every other particle. When the individual has progressed\r\nto a perfect self-interest, there will be over against it, acting\r\nand reacting with it, a correspondingly perfect self-interest of the\r\ncommunity. Meanwhile, we who are the creators of society have got\r\nthe times out of joint, because, less experienced than the Creator\r\nof the balanced matter of earth, we have given the precedence to the\r\npowers on one side. As gods we are but half-grown. For a hundred\r\nyears or so our economic theory has been one of industrial government\r\nby the self-interest of the individual. Political government by the\r\nself-interest of the individual we call anarchy. It is one of the\r\nparadoxes of public opinion that the people of America, least tolerant\r\nof this theory of anarchy in political government, lead in practising\r\nit in industry. Politically, we are civilized; industrially, not yet.\r\nOur century, given to this _laissez-faire_--\"leave the individual\r\nalone; he will do what is best for himself, and what is best for him is\r\nbest for all\"--has done one good: it has put society at the mercy of\r\nits own ideals, and has produced an actual anarchy in industry which is\r\nhorrifying us into a change of doctrines.\r\n\r\nWe have not been able to see the people for the persons in it. But\r\nthere is a people, and it is as different from a mere juxtaposition\r\nof persons as a globe of glass from the handful of sand out of which\r\nit was melted. It is becoming, socially, known to itself, with that\r\nself-consciousness which distinguishes the quick from the dead and the\r\nunborn. Every community, said Pascal, is a man, and every man, said\r\nPlato, is a community. There is a new self-interest--that of the \"man\r\ncalled million,\" as Mazzini named him--and with this social motive the\r\nother, which has so long had its own way, has now to reckon. Mankind\r\nhas gone astray following a truth seen only partially, but coronated\r\nas a whole truth. Many civilizations must worship good men as gods\r\nand follow the divinity of one and another before civilization sees\r\nthat these are only single stars in a firmament of humanity. Our\r\ncivilization has followed the self-interest of the individual to learn\r\nthat it was but one of the complex forces of self-interest.\r\n\r\nThe true _laissez-faire_ is, let the individual do what the individual\r\ncan do best, and let the community do what the community can do best.\r\nThe _laissez-faire_ of social self-interest, if true, cannot conflict\r\nwith the individual self-interest, if true, but it must outrank it\r\nalways. What we have called \"free competition\" has not been free, only\r\nfreer than what went before. The free is still to come. The pressure\r\nwe feel is notice to prepare for it. Civilization--the process of\r\nmaking men citizens in their relations to each other, by exacting of\r\neach that he give to all that which he receives from all--has reached\r\nonly those forms of common effort which, because most general and most\r\nvital, first demanded its harmonizing touch. Men joining in the labors\r\nof the family, the mutual sacrifices of the club or the church in the\r\nunion of forces for self-defence and for the gains of co-operation on\r\nthe largest scale in labors of universal concern, like letter-carrying,\r\nhave come to be so far civilized.\r\n\r\nHistory is condensed in the catchwords of the people. In the phrases of\r\nindividual self-interest which have been the shibboleths of the main\r\nactivities of our last hundred years were prophesied: the filling up of\r\nthe Mississippi by the forest-destroying, self-seeking lumber companies\r\nof the North; the disintegration of the American family--among the rich\r\nby too little poverty, and among the poor by too much; the embezzlement\r\nof public highways and public franchises into private property; the\r\ndevolution of the American merchants and manufacturers into the\r\nbusiness dependants--and social and political dependants, therefore--of\r\na few men in each great department of trade, from dry-goods to whiskey;\r\nthe devolution of the free farmer into a tenant, and of the working-man\r\ninto a fixture of the locomotive or the factory, forbidden to leave\r\nexcept by permission of his employer or the public; and that mêlée of\r\ninjunctions, bayonets, idle men and idle machinery, rich man's fear of\r\npoor man and poor man's fear of starvation, we call trade and industry.\r\n\r\nWhere the self-interest of the individual is allowed to be the rule\r\nboth of social and personal action, the level of all is forced down\r\nto that of the lowest. Business excuses itself for the things it\r\ndoes--cuts in wages, exactions in hours, tricks of competition--on\r\nthe plea that the merciful are compelled to follow the cruel. \"It is\r\npleaded as an excuse by those\" (common carriers) \"who desire to obey\r\nthe\" (Interstate Commerce) \"law that self-preservation drives them to\r\nviolate it because other carriers persist in doing so,\" says Senator\r\nCullom. When the self-interest of society is made the standard the\r\nlowest must rise to the average. The one pulls down, the other up. That\r\nmen's hearts are bad and that bad men will do bad things has a truth\r\nin it. But whatever the general average of morals, the anarchy which\r\ngives such individuals their head and leaves them to set the pace for\r\nall will produce infinitely worse results than a policy which applies\r\nmutual checks and inspirations. Bad kings make bad reigns, but monarchy\r\nis bad because it is arbitrary power, and that, whether it be political\r\nor industrial, makes even good men bad.\r\n\r\nA partial truth universally applied as this of self-interest has been\r\nis a universal error. Everything goes to defeat. Highways are used to\r\nprevent travel and traffic. Ownership of the means of production is\r\nsought in order to \"shut down\" production, and the means of plenty\r\nmake famine. All follow self-interest to find that though they have\r\ncreated marvellous wealth it is not theirs. We pledge \"our lives, our\r\nfortunes, and our sacred honor\" to establish the rule of the majority,\r\nand end by finding that the minority--a minority in morals, money, and\r\nmen--are our masters whichever way we turn. We agonize over \"economy,\"\r\nbut sell all our grain and pork and oil and cotton at exchanges where\r\nwe pay brokerage on a hundred or a thousand barrels or bushels or bales\r\nof wind to get one real one sold. These intolerabilities--sweat-shops\r\nwhere model merchants buy and sell the cast-off scarlet-fever skins\r\nof the poor, factory and mine where childhood is forbidden to become\r\nmanhood and manhood is forbidden to die a natural death, mausoleums in\r\nwhich we bury the dead rich, slums in which we bury the living poor,\r\ncoal pools with their manufacture of artificial winter--all these are\r\nthe rule of private self-interest arrived at its destination.\r\n\r\nA really human life is impossible in our cities, but they cannot be\r\nreconstructed under the old self-interest. Chicago was rebuilt wrong\r\nafter the fire. Able men pointed out the avenues to a wider and better\r\nmunicipal life, but they could not be opened through the private\r\ninterpositions that blocked the way. The slaughter of railway men\r\ncoupling cars was shown, in a debate in the United States Senate, to be\r\ntwice as great as it would be if the men were in active service in war.\r\nBut under the scramble for private gain our society on its railway side\r\ncannot develop the energy to introduce the improved appliances ready to\r\nhand which would save these lives, all young and vigorous. The cost of\r\nthe change would be repaid in 100-per-cent. dividends every year by the\r\nmoney value alone to us of the men now killed and wounded. But we shall\r\nhave to wait for a nobler arithmetic to give us investments so good as\r\nthat. The lean kine of self-interest devour the fat kine. The railroad\r\nstockholder, idolater of self-interest, lets himself be robbed--like\r\nthe stockholder of all the railroads in this story--either because he\r\nis too rich to mind, too feeble to make himself heard, or too much\r\nimplicated elsewhere as principal in the same kind of depredation to\r\ncare or dare to stir what he knows to be a universal scandal. He has\r\nbecome within himself the battle-ground of a troop of warring devils of\r\nselfishness; his selfishness as a stockholder clutched at the throat by\r\nhis selfishness as a parasite, in some \"inside deal,\" feeding on the\r\nstockholder; some rebate arrangement, fast-freight line, sleeping-car\r\ncompany, or what not. And, as like as not, upon this one's back is\r\nanother devil of depredation from some inner ring within a ring. Torn\r\nat the vitals, the enlightened swinishness of our _leit-motif_ is\r\nhastening to throw itself into the sea.\r\n\r\nWe are very poor. The striking feature of our economic condition is\r\nour poverty, not our wealth. We make ourselves \"rich\" by appropriating\r\nthe property of others by methods which lessen the total property of\r\nall. Spain took such riches from America and grew poor. Modern wealth\r\nmore and more resembles the winnings of speculators in bread during\r\nfamine--worse, for to make the money it makes the famine. What we\r\ncall cheapness shows itself to be unnatural fortunes for a very few,\r\nmonstrous luxury for them and proportionate deprivation for the people,\r\njudges debauched, trustees dishonored, Congress and State legislatures\r\ninsulted and defied, when not seduced, multitudes of honest men ruined\r\nand driven to despair, the common carrier made a mere instrument for\r\nthe creation of a new baronage, an example set to hundreds of would-be\r\ncommercial Cæsars to repeat this rapine in other industries and call it\r\n\"business,\" a process set in operation all over the United States for\r\nthe progressive extinction of the independence of laboring men, and all\r\nbusiness men except the very rich, and their reduction to a state of\r\nvassalage to lords or squires in each department of trade and industry.\r\nAll these--tears, ruin, dishonor, and treason--are the unmarked\r\nadditions to the \"price marked on the goods.\"\r\n\r\nShall we buy cheap of Captain Kidd, and shut our ears to the agony\r\nthat rustles in his silks? Shall we believe that Captain Kidd, who\r\nkills commerce by the act which enables him to sell at half-price, is\r\na cheapener? Shall we preach and practise doctrines which make the\r\nBlack Flag the emblem of success on the high seas of human interchange\r\nof service, and complain when we see mankind's argosies of hope and\r\nplenty shrink into private hoards of treasure, buried in selfish sands\r\nto be lost forever, even to cupidity? If this be cheapness, it comes\r\nby the grace of the seller, and that is the first shape of dearness,\r\nas security in society by the grace of the ruler is the first form of\r\ninsecurity.\r\n\r\nThe new wealth now administers estates of fabulous extent from\r\nmetropolitan bureaus, and all the profits flow to men who know\r\nnothing of the real business out of which they are made. Red tape,\r\ncomplication, the hired man, conspiracy have taken the place of the\r\nwatchful eye of the owner, the old-fashioned hand at the plough that\r\nmust \"hold or drive.\" We now have Captains of Industry, with a few\r\naids, rearranging from office-chairs this or that industry, by mere\r\ncontrivances of wit compelling the fruits of the labor of tens of\r\nthousands of their fellows, who never saw them, never heard of them,\r\nto be every day deposited unwilling and unwitting to their own credit\r\nat the bank; setting, as by necromancy, hundreds of properties, large\r\nand small, in a score of communities, to flying through invisible\r\nways into their hands; sitting calm through all the hubbub raised in\r\ncourts, legislatures, and public places, and by dictating letters\r\nand whispering words remaining the master magicians of the scene;\r\ndefying, though private citizens, all the forces and authorities of a\r\nwhole people; by the mere mastery of compelling brain, without putting\r\nhand to anything, opening or closing the earth's treasures of oil or\r\ncoal or gas or copper or what not; pulling down or putting up great\r\nbuildings, factories, towns themselves; moving men and their money this\r\nway and that; inserting their will as part of the law of life of the\r\npeople--American, European, and Asiatic--and, against the protest of\r\na whole civilization, making themselves, their methods and principles,\r\nits emblematic figures.\r\n\r\nSyndicates, by one stroke, get the power of selling dear on one side,\r\nand producing cheap on the other. Thus they keep themselves happy,\r\nprices high, and the people hungry. What model merchant could ask\r\nmore? The dream of the king who wished that all his people had but one\r\nneck that he might decapitate them at one blow is realized to-day in\r\nthis industrial garrote. The syndicate has but to turn its screw, and\r\nevery neck begins to break. Prices paid to such intercepters are not\r\nan exchange of service; they are ransom paid by the people for their\r\nlives. The ability of the citizen to pay may fluctuate; what he must\r\npay remains fixed, or advances like the rent of the Irish tenant to the\r\nabsentee landlord until the community interfered. Those who have this\r\npower to draw the money from the people--from every railroad station,\r\nevery street-car, every fireplace, every salt-cellar, every bread-pan,\r\nwash-board, and coal-scuttle--to their own safes have the further\r\nincentive to make this money worth the most possible. By contracting\r\nthe issue of currency and contracting it again by hoarding it in their\r\nbanks, safe-deposit vaults, and the government treasury, they can\r\ndepress the prices of all that belongs to the people. Their own prices\r\nare fixed. These are \"regular prices,\" established by price-lists.\r\nGiven, as a ruling motive, the principles of business--to get the\r\nmost and give the least; given the legal and economic, physical and\r\nmechanical control, possible under our present social arrangements, to\r\nthe few over the many, and the certain end of all this, if unarrested,\r\nunreversed, can be nothing less than a return to chattel slavery. There\r\nmay be some finer name, but the fact will not be finer. Between our\r\npresent tolerance and our completed subjection the distance is not so\r\nfar as that from the equality and simplicity of our Pilgrim Fathers to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nEverything withers--even charity. Aristocratic benevolence spends\r\na shrunken stream in comparison with democratic benevolence. In an\r\naddress to the public, soliciting subscriptions, the Committee of the\r\nUnited Hospitals Association of New York said, in December, 1893: \"The\r\ncommittee have found that, through the obliteration of old methods of\r\nindividual competition by the establishment of large corporations and\r\ntrusts in modern times, the income of such charitable institutions\r\nas are supported by the individual gifts of the benevolent has been\r\nseriously affected.\"\r\n\r\nFranklin pricked the bubble of the lottery by showing that to buy all\r\nthe tickets and win all the prizes was to be most surely the loser. Our\r\nnascent common-sense begins to see that the many must always lose where\r\nall spend their lives trying to get more than they give, and that all\r\nlose when any lose. The welfare of all is more than the welfare of the\r\nmany, the few, or the one. If the few or the one are not fine enough\r\nto accept this truth from sentiment or conscience, they can find other\r\nreasons as convincing, though not as amiable. From the old régime of\r\nFrance, the slave-holders of the South, the death-rate of tyrants,\r\nthe fear of their brothers which the rich and the great of to-day are\r\nprinting on their faces, in fugitive-slave treaties with Russia, and in\r\nthe frowning arsenals and armories building in our cities for \"law and\r\norder,\" they can learn how to spell self-interest.\r\n\r\nIf all will sacrifice themselves, none need be sacrificed. But if one\r\nmay sacrifice another, all are sacrificed. That is the difference\r\nbetween self-interest and other-self interest. In industry we have\r\nbeen substituting all the mean passions that can set man against man\r\nin place of the irresistible power of brotherhood. To tell us of the\r\nprogressive sway of brotherhood in all human affairs is the sole\r\nmessage of history. \"Love thy neighbor as thyself\" is not the phrase\r\nof a ritual of sentiment for the unapplied emotion of pious hours;\r\nit is the exact formula of the force to-day operating the greatest\r\ninstitutions man has established. It is as secular as sacred. Only\r\nby each neighbor giving the other every right of free thought, free\r\nmovement, free representation which he demands for himself; only by\r\ncalling every neighbor a friend, and literally laying down his life\r\nfor his friend against foreign invasion or domestic tumult; only by\r\nthe equalization which gives the vote to all and denies kingship to\r\nall, however strong or \"fittest\"--only thus is man establishing the\r\ncommunity, the republic, which, with all its failings, is the highest\r\nbecause the realest application of the spirit of human brotherhood.\r\nWonderful are the dividends of this investment. You are but one, and\r\ncan give only yourself to America. You give free speech, and 65,000,000\r\nof your countrymen will guard the freedom of your lips. Your single\r\noffer of your right arm puts 65,000,000 of sheltering arms about you.\r\nDoes \"business\" pay such profits? Wealth will remain a secret unguessed\r\nby business until it has reincorporated itself under the law which\r\nreckons as the property of each one the total of all the possessions of\r\nall his neighbors.\r\n\r\nSociety could not live a day, the Bishop of Peterborough said, if\r\nit put the principles of Christ into practice. There is no rarer\r\ngift than that of eyes to see what we see. Society is society, and\r\nlives its day solely by virtue of having put into actual routine and\r\nmatter-of-fact application the principles of Christ and other bringers\r\nof the same message. Imperfect and faulty though the execution, it is\r\nthese principles which are the family, the tribe, the sect, the club,\r\nthe mutual-benefit society, the State, with their mutual services,\r\nforbearance, and guarantees. The principles of Christ are the cause\r\nand essence of society. They are not the ideal of which we dream; they\r\nare the applied means with which we are working out our real life in\r\n\"the light of common day.\" They have not been so much revealed to us\r\nby our inspired ones as best seen and best said by them. Insurance for\r\nfire, accident, sickness, old age, death--the ills that flesh is heir\r\nto--has the same co-operation for its innermost forces. Limited now by\r\nthe intervention of the selfishness of profit-seeking, it needs only to\r\nbe freed from this, and added, as in New Zealand, to the growing list\r\nof the mutualities of the general welfare operated by the State to be\r\nseen as what it is. The golden rule is the original of every political\r\nconstitution, written and unwritten, and all our reforms are but the\r\npains with which we strive to improve the copy.\r\n\r\nIn the worst governments and societies that have existed one good can\r\nbe seen--so good that the horrors of them fall back into secondary\r\nplaces as extrinsic, accidental. That good is the ability of men to\r\nlead the life together. The more perfect monopoly makes itself the more\r\ndoes it bring into strong lights the greatest fact of our industry, of\r\nfar more permanent value than the greed which has for the moment made\r\nitself the cynosure of all eyes. It makes this fair world more fair to\r\nconsider the loyalties, intelligences, docilities of the multitudes who\r\nare guarding, developing, operating with the faithfulness of brothers\r\nand the keen interest of owners properties and industries in which\r\nbrotherhood is not known and their title is not more than a tenancy at\r\nwill. One of the largest stones in the arch of \"consolidation,\" perhaps\r\nthe key-stone, is that men have become so intelligent, so responsive\r\nand responsible, so co-operative that they can be intrusted in great\r\nmasses with the care of vast properties owned entirely by others and\r\nwith the operation of complicated processes, although but a slender\r\ncost of subsistence is awarded them out of fabulous profits. The\r\nspectacle of the million and more employés of the railroads of this\r\ncountry despatching trains, maintaining tracks, collecting fares and\r\nfreights, and turning over hundreds of millions of net profits to the\r\nowners, not one in a thousand of whom would know how to do the simplest\r\nof these things for himself, is possible only where civilization\r\nhas reached a high average of morals and culture. More and more the\r\nmills and mines and stores, and even the farms and forests, are being\r\nadministered by others than the owners. The virtue of the people is\r\ntaking the place Poor Richard thought only the eye of the owner could\r\nfill. If mankind, driven by their fears and the greed of others, can do\r\nso well, what will be their productivity and cheer when the \"interest\r\nof all\" sings them to their work?\r\n\r\nThis new morality and new spring of wealth have been seized first\r\nby the appropriating ones among us. But, as has been in government,\r\ntheir intervention of greed is but a passing phase. Mankind belongs\r\nto itself, not to kings or monopolists, and will supersede the one as\r\nsurely as the other with the institutions of democracy. Yes, Callicles,\r\nsaid Socrates, the greatest are usually the bad, for they have the\r\npower. If power could continue paternal and benign, mankind would not\r\nbe rising through one emancipation after another into a progressive\r\ncommunion of equalities. The individual and society will always be\r\nwrestling with each other in a composition of forces. But to just\r\nthe extent to which civilization prevails, society will be held as\r\ninviolable as the individual; not subordinate--indeed inaudible--as\r\nnow in the counting-room and corporation-office. We have overworked\r\nthe self-interest of the individual. The line of conflict between\r\nindividual and social is a progressive one of the discovery of point\r\nafter point in which the two are identical. Society thus passes from\r\nconflict to harmony, and on to another conflict. Civilization is the\r\nunceasing accretion of these social solutions. We fight out to an\r\nequilibrium, as in the abolition of human slavery; then upon this new\r\nlevel thus built up we enter upon the struggle for a new equilibrium,\r\nas now in the labor movement. The man for himself destroys himself and\r\nall men; only society can foster him and them.\r\n\r\nThe greatest happiness of the greatest number is only the doctrine of\r\nself-interest writ large and made more dangerous by multitude. It is\r\nthe self-interest of the majority, and this has written some of the\r\nunloveliest chapters of history. There have never been slaves more\r\nmiserable than those of Sparta, where the State was the owner. American\r\ndemocracy prepares to repeat these distresses of the selfishness of\r\nthe many, and gives notice to its railway employés of a new divine\r\nright--\"the convenience of the public\"--to which they must forego every\r\nright of manhood. No better definition of slave could be found than\r\none who must work at the convenience of another. This is the position\r\ninto which recent legal decisions and acts of the Federal executive\r\nforce railway men. These speak in the name of Interstate Commerce, but\r\ntheir logic can be as easily applied by State judges to State commerce,\r\nand all working-men are manifestly as necessary, each in his function,\r\nto the convenience of the public as the men of the rail. The greatest\r\nhappiness of all must be the formula. When Lamennais said, \"I love my\r\nfamily more than myself, my village more than my family, my country\r\nmore than my village, and mankind more than my country,\" he showed\r\nhimself not only a good lover, but the only good arithmetician.\r\n\r\nChildren yet, we run everything we do--love or war, work or leisure,\r\nreligion or liberty--to excess. Every possibility of body and mind\r\nmust be played upon till it is torn to pieces, as toys by children.\r\nPriests, voluptuaries, tyrants, knights, ascetics--in the long\r\nprocession of fanatics a new-comer takes his place; he is called\r\n\"the model merchant\"--the cruelest fanatic in history. He is the\r\nproduct of ages given to progressive devotion to \"trading.\" He is the\r\nhigh-priest of the latest idolatry, the self-worship of self-interest.\r\nWhirling-dervish of the market, self, friends, and family, body and\r\nsoul, loves, hopes, and faith, all are sacrificed to seeing how many\r\n\"turns\" he can make before he drops dead. Trade began, Sir Henry Sumner\r\nMaine tells us, not within the family or community, but without. Its\r\nfirst appearances are on the neutral borderland between hostile tribes.\r\nThere, in times of peace, they meet to trade, and think it no sin\r\nthat \"the buyer must beware,\" since the buyer is an enemy. Trade has\r\nspread thence, carrying with itself into family and State the poison of\r\nenmity. From the fatherhood of the old patriarchal life, where father\r\nand brother sold each other nothing, the world has chaffered along to\r\nthe anarchy of a \"free\" trade which sells everything. One thing after\r\nanother has passed out from under the régime of brotherhood and passed\r\nin under that of bargainhood. The ground we move on, the bodies we\r\nwork with, and the necessaries we live by are all being \"exchanged,\"\r\nby \"rules fetched with cupidity from heartless schools,\" into the\r\nownership of the Jacobs of mankind. By these rules the cunning are\r\nthe good, and the weak and the tender the bad, and the good are to\r\nhave all the goods and the weak are to have nothing. These rules give\r\none the power to supply or deny work to thousands, and to use the\r\nstarvation terms of the men he disemploys as the measure of the cost\r\nof subsistence of all workmen. This must be near the end. The very\r\nchurches have become mercantilized, and are markets in which \"prophets\"\r\nare paid fancy prices--\"always called of God,\" as Milton said, \"but\r\nalways to a greater benefice\"--and worshippers buy and sell knee-room.\r\n\r\nConceptions of duty take on a correspondingly unnatural complexion.\r\nThe main exhortations the world gives beginners are how to \"get\r\non\"--the getting on so ardently inculcated being to get, like the\r\nold-man-of-the-sea, on somebody's back. \"If war fails you in the\r\ncountry where you are, you must go where there is war,\" said one of the\r\nsuccessful men of the fourteenth century to a young knight who asked\r\nhim for the Laws of Life. \"I shall be perfectly satisfied with you,\" I\r\nheard one of the great business geniuses of America say to his son, \"if\r\nyou will only always go to bed at night worth more than when you got up\r\nin the morning.\" The system grows, as all systems do, more complicated,\r\nand gets further away from its first purposes of barter of real things\r\nand services. It goes more under the hands of men of apt selfishness,\r\nwho push it further away from general comprehension and the general\r\ngood. Tariffs, currencies, finances, freight-rate sheets, the laws,\r\nbecome instruments of privilege, and just in proportion become puzzles\r\nno people can decipher. \"I have a right to buy my labor where I can buy\r\nit cheapest\"--beginning as a protest against the selfish exclusions of\r\nantiquated trade-guilds outgrown by the new times--has at last come to\r\nmean, \"I have a right to do anything to cheapen the labor I want to\r\nbuy, even to destroying the family life of the people.\"\r\n\r\nWhen steaming kettles grew into beasts of burden and public highways\r\ndwindled into private property administered by private motives for\r\nprivate ends, all previous tendencies were intensified into a sudden\r\nwhirl redistributing wealth and labors. It appears to have been\r\nthe destiny of the railroad to begin and of oil to lubricate to its\r\nfinish the last stage of this crazy commercialism. Business colors the\r\nmodern world as war reddened the ancient world. Out of such delirium\r\nmonsters are bred, and their excesses destroy the system that brought\r\nthem forth. There is a strong suggestion of moral insanity in the\r\nunrelieved sameness of mood and unvarying repetition of one act in the\r\nlife of the model merchant. Sane minds by an irresistible law alternate\r\none tension with another. Only a lunatic is always smiling or always\r\nweeping or always clamoring for dividends. Eras show their last stages\r\nby producing men who sum up individually the morbid characteristics\r\nof the mass. When the crisis comes in which the gathering tendencies\r\nof generations shoot forward in the avalanche, there is born some\r\ngroup of men perfect for their function--good be it or bad. They need\r\nto take time for no second thought, and will not delay the unhalting\r\nreparations of nature by so much as the time given to one tear over the\r\nbattle-field or the bargain. With their birth their mission is given\r\nthem, whether it be the mission of Lucifer or Gabriel. This mission\r\nbecomes their conscience. The righteous indignation that other men feel\r\nagainst sin these men feel against that which withstands them. Sincere\r\nas rattlesnakes, they are selfish with the unconsciousness possible to\r\nonly the entirely commonplace, without the curiosity to question their\r\ntimes or the imagination to conceive the pain they inflict, and their\r\nevery ideal is satisfied by the conventionalities of church, parlor,\r\nand counting-room. These men are the touchstones to wither the cant of\r\nan age.\r\n\r\nWe preach \"Do as you would be done by\" in our churches, and \"A fair\r\nexchange no robbery\" in our counting-rooms, and \"All citizens are\r\nequal as citizens\" in courts and Congress. Just as we are in danger\r\nof believing that to say these things is to do them and be them,\r\nthere come unto us these men, practical as granite and gravitation.\r\nTaking their cue not from our lips, but from our lives, they better\r\nthe instruction, and, passing easily to the high seats at every table,\r\nprove that we are liars and hypocrites. Their only secret is that they\r\ndo, better than we, the things we are all trying to do, but of which in\r\nour morning and evening prayers, seen of all men, we are continually\r\nmaking believe to pray: Good Lord, deliver us! When the hour strikes\r\nfor such leaders, they come and pass as by a law of nature to the\r\nfront. All follow them. It is their fate and ours that they must work\r\nout to the end the destiny interwoven of their own insatiate ambition\r\nand the false ideals of us who have created them and their opportunity.\r\n\r\nIf our civilization is destroyed, as Macaulay predicted, it will not\r\nbe by his barbarians from below. Our barbarians come from above. Our\r\ngreat money-makers have sprung in one generation into seats of power\r\nkings do not know. The forces and the wealth are new, and have been\r\nthe opportunity of new men. Without restraints of culture, experience,\r\nthe pride, or even the inherited caution of class or rank, these men,\r\nintoxicated, think they are the wave instead of the float, and that\r\nthey have created the business which has created them. To them science\r\nis but a never-ending répertoire of investments stored up by nature for\r\nthe syndicates, government but a fountain of franchises, the nations\r\nbut customers in squads, and a million the unit of a new arithmetic of\r\nwealth written for them. They claim a power without control, exercised\r\nthrough forms which make it secret, anonymous, and perpetual. The\r\npossibilities of its gratification have been widening before them\r\nwithout interruption since they began, and even at a thousand millions\r\nthey will feel no satiation and will see no place to stop. They are\r\ngluttons of luxury and power, rough, unsocialized, believing that\r\nmankind must be kept terrorized. Powers of pity die out of them,\r\nbecause they work through agents and die in their agents, because what\r\nthey do is not for themselves.\r\n\r\nOf gods, friends, learnings, of the uncomprehended civilization they\r\noverrun, they ask but one question: How much? What is a good time\r\nto sell? What is a good time to buy? The Church and the Capitol,\r\nincarnating the sacrifices and triumphs of a procession of martyrs\r\nand patriots since the dawn of freedom, are good enough for a\r\nmoney-changer's shop for them, and a market and shambles. Their\r\nheathen eyes see in the law and its consecrated officers nothing but\r\nan intelligence-office and hired men to help them burglarize the\r\ntreasures accumulated for thousands of years at the altars of liberty\r\nand justice, that they may burn their marbles for the lime of commerce.\r\n\r\nBy their windfall of new power they have been forced into the position\r\nof public enemies. Its new forms make them seem not to be within the\r\njurisdiction of the social restraints which many ages of suffering\r\nhave taught us to bind about the old powers of man over man. A fury\r\nof rule or ruin has always in the history of human affairs been a\r\ncharacteristic of the \"strong men\" whose fate it is to be in at the\r\ndeath of an expiring principle. The leaders who, two hundred years ago,\r\nwould have been crazy with conquest, to-day are crazy with competition.\r\nTo a dying era some man is always born to enfranchise it by revealing\r\nit to itself. Men repay such benefactors by turning to rend them. Most\r\nunhappy is the fate of him whose destiny it is to lead mankind too\r\nfar in its own path. Such is the function of these men, such will be\r\ntheir lot, as that of those for whom they are building up these wizard\r\nwealths.\r\n\r\nPoor thinking means poor doing. In casting about for the cause of\r\nour industrial evils, public opinion has successively found it in\r\n\"competition,\" \"combination,\" the \"corporations,\" \"conspiracies,\"\r\n\"trusts.\" But competition has ended in combination, and our new wealth\r\ntakes as it chooses the form of corporation or trust, or corporation\r\nagain, and with every change grows greater and worse. Under these\r\nkaleidoscopic masks we begin at last to see progressing to its terminus\r\na steady consolidation, the end of which is one-man power. The\r\nconspiracy ends in one, and one cannot conspire with himself. When this\r\nsolidification of many into one has been reached, we shall be at last\r\nface to face with the naked truth that it is not only the form but the\r\nfact of arbitrary power, of control without consent, of rule without\r\nrepresentation that concerns us.\r\n\r\nBusiness motived by the self-interest of the individual runs into\r\nmonopoly at every point it touches the social life--land monopoly,\r\ntransportation monopoly, trade monopoly, political monopoly in all\r\nits forms, from contraction of the currency to corruption in office.\r\nThe society in which in half a lifetime a man without a penny can\r\nbecome a hundred times a millionaire is as over-ripe, industrially, as\r\nwas, politically, the Rome in which the most popular bully could lift\r\nhimself from the ranks of the legion on to the throne of the Cæsars.\r\nOur rising issue is with business. Monopoly is business at the end of\r\nits journey. It has got there. The irrepressible conflict is now as\r\ndistinctly with business as the issue so lately met was with slavery.\r\nSlavery went first only because it was the cruder form of business.\r\n\r\nAgainst the principles, and the men embodying them and pushing them\r\nto extremes--by which the powers of government, given by all for all,\r\nare used as franchises for personal aggrandizement; by which, in the\r\nsame line, the common toil of all and the common gifts of nature,\r\nlands, forces, mines, sites, are turned from service to selfishness,\r\nand are made by one and the same stroke to give gluts to a few and\r\nimpoverishment to the many--we must plan our campaign. The yacht of\r\nthe millionaire incorporates a million days' labor which might have\r\nbeen given to abolishing the slums, and every day it runs the labor\r\nof hundreds of men is withdrawn from the production of helpful things\r\nfor humanity, and each of us is equally guilty who directs to his own\r\npleasure the labor he should turn to the wants of others. Our fanatic\r\nof wealth reverses the rule that serving mankind is the end and wealth\r\nan incident, and has made wealth the end and the service an accident,\r\nuntil he can finally justify crime itself if it is a means to the\r\nend--wealth--which has come to be the supreme good; and we follow him.\r\n\r\nIt is an adjudicated fact of the business and social life of America\r\nthat to receive the profits of crime and cherish the agents who\r\ncommit it does not disqualify for fellowship in the most \"solid\"\r\ncircles--financial, commercial, religious, or social. It illustrates\r\nwhat Ruskin calls the \"morbid\" character of modern business that\r\nthe history of its most brilliant episodes must be studied in the\r\nvestibules of the penitentiary. The riches of the combinations are\r\nthe winnings of a policy which, we have seen, has certain constant\r\nfeatures. Property to the extent of uncounted millions has been changed\r\nfrom the possession of the many who owned it to the few who hold it:\r\n\r\n1. Without the knowledge of the real owners.\r\n\r\n2. Without their consent.\r\n\r\n3. With no compensation to them for the value taken.\r\n\r\n4. By falsehood, often under oath.\r\n\r\n5. In violation of the law.\r\n\r\nOur civilization is builded on competition, and competition\r\nevolves itself crime--to so acute an infatuation has the lunacy of\r\nself-interest carried our dominant opinion. We are hurried far beyond\r\nthe point of not listening to the new conscience which, pioneering in\r\nmoral exploration, declares that conduct we think right because called\r\n\"trade\" is really lying, stealing, murder. \"The definite result,\"\r\nRuskin preaches, \"of all our modern haste to be rich is assuredly and\r\nconstantly the murder of a certain number of persons by our hands every\r\nyear.\" To be unawakened by this new voice is bad enough, but we shut\r\nour ears even against the old conscience.\r\n\r\nWe cannot deal with this unless we cleanse our hearts of all\r\ndisordering rage. \"The rarer action is in virtue rather than in\r\nvengeance.\" Our tyrants are our ideals incarnating themselves in men\r\nborn to command. What these men are we have made them. All governments\r\nare representative governments; none of them more so than our\r\ngovernment of industry. We go hopelessly astray if we seek the solution\r\nof our problems in the belief that our business rulers are worse men in\r\nkind than ourselves. Worse in degree; yes. It is a race to the bad, and\r\nthe winners are the worst. A system in which the prizes go to meanness\r\ninvariably marches with the meanest men at the head. But if any could\r\nbe meaner than the meanest it would be they who run and fail and rail.\r\n\r\nEvery idea finds its especially susceptible souls. These men are\r\nour most susceptible souls to the idea of individual self-interest.\r\nThey have believed implicitly what we have taught, and have been the\r\nmost faithful in trying to make the talent given them grow into ten\r\ntalents. They rise superior to our half-hearted social corrections:\r\npublicity, private competition, all devices of market-opposition,\r\nprivate litigation, public investigation, legislation, and criminal\r\nprosecution--all. Their power is greater to-day than it was yesterday,\r\nand will be greater to-morrow. The public does not withhold its favor,\r\nbut deals with them, protects them, refuses to treat their crimes as it\r\ntreats those of the poor, and admits them to the highest places. The\r\npredominant mood is the more or less concealed regret of the citizens\r\nthat they have not been able to conceive and execute the same lucky\r\nstroke or some other as profitable. The conclusion is irresistible that\r\nmen so given the lead are the representatives of the real \"spirit of\r\nthe age,\" and that the protestants against them are not representative\r\nof our times--are at the best but intimators of times which may be.\r\n\r\nTwo social energies have been in conflict, and the energy of reform has\r\nso far proved the weaker. We have chartered the self-interest of the\r\nindividual as the rightful sovereign of conduct; we have taught that\r\nthe scramble for profit is the best method of administering the riches\r\nof earth and the exchange of services. Only those can attack this\r\nsystem who attack its central principle, that strength gives the strong\r\nin the market the right to destroy his neighbor. Only as we have denied\r\nthat right to the strong elsewhere have we made ourselves as civilized\r\nas we are. And we cannot make a change as long as our songs, customs,\r\ncatchwords, and public opinions tell all to do the same thing if they\r\ncan. Society, in each person of its multitudes, must recognize that the\r\nsame principles of the interest of all being the rule of all, of the\r\nstrong serving the weak, of the first being the last--\"I am among you\r\nas one that serves\"--which have given us the home where the weakest\r\nis the one surest of his rights and of the fullest service of the\r\nstrongest, and have given us the republic in which all join their labor\r\nthat the poorest may be fed, the weakest defended, and all educated\r\nand prospered, must be applied where men associate in common toil as\r\nwherever they associate. Not until then can the forces be reversed\r\nwhich generate those obnoxious persons--our fittest.\r\n\r\nOur system, so fair in its theory and so fertile in its happiness and\r\nprosperity in its first century, is now, following the fate of systems,\r\nbecoming artificial, technical, corrupt; and, as always happens in\r\nhuman institutions, after noon, power is stealing from the many to the\r\nfew. Believing wealth to be good, the people believed the wealthy to\r\nbe good. But, again in history, power has intoxicated and hardened its\r\npossessors, and Pharaohs are bred in counting-rooms as they were in\r\npalaces. Their furniture must be banished to the world-garret, where\r\nlie the out-worn trappings of the guilds and slavery and other old\r\nlumber of human institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nAND THE NEW\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have given the prize of power to the strong, the cunning, the\r\narithmetical, and we must expect nothing else but that they will use it\r\ncunningly and arithmetically. For what else can they suppose we gave\r\nit to them? If the power really flows from the people, and should be\r\nused for them; if its best administration can be got, as in government,\r\nonly by the participation in it of men of all views and interests; if\r\nin the collision of all these, as in democracy, the better policy is\r\nprogressively preponderant; if this is a policy which, with whatever\r\ndefects, is better than that which can be evolved by narrower or more\r\nselfish or less multitudinous influences of persons or classes, then\r\nthis power should be taken up by the people. \"The mere conflict of\r\nprivate interests will never produce a well-ordered commonwealth of\r\nlabor,\" says the author of the article on political economy in the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_. The failure of monarchy and feudalism and\r\nthe visibly impending failure of our business system all reveal a\r\nlaw of nature. The harmony of things insists that that which is the\r\nsource of power, wealth, and delight shall also be the ruler of it.\r\nThat which is must also seem. It is the people from whom come the\r\nforces with which kings and millionaires ride the world, and until\r\nthe people take their proper place in the seat of sovereignty, these\r\npseudo owners--mere claimants and usurpers--will, by the very falsity\r\nand iniquity of their position, be pushed into deceit, tyranny, and\r\ncruelty, ending in downfall.\r\n\r\nThousands of years' experience has proved that government must begin\r\nwhere it ends--with the people; that the general welfare demands that\r\nthey who exercise the powers and they upon whom these are exercised\r\nmust be the same, and that higher political ideals can be realized\r\nonly through higher political forms. Myriads of experiments to get\r\nthe substance of liberty out of the forms of tyranny, to believe\r\nin princes, to trust good men to do good as kings, have taught the\r\ninexorable truth that, in the economy of nature, form and substance\r\nmust move together, and are as inextricably interdependent as are,\r\nwithin our experience, what we call matter and spirit. Identical is the\r\nlesson we are learning with regard to industrial power and property. We\r\nare calling upon their owners, as mankind called upon kings in their\r\nday, to be good and kind, wise and sweet, and we are calling in vain.\r\nWe are asking them not to be what we have made them to be. We put power\r\ninto their hands and ask them not to use it as power. If this power is\r\na trust for the people, the people betrayed it when they made private\r\nestates out of it for individuals. If the spirit of power is to change,\r\ninstitutions must change as much. Liberty recast the old forms of\r\ngovernment into the Republic, and it must remould our institutions of\r\nwealth into the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe question is not whether monopoly is to continue. The sun sets every\r\nnight on a greater majority against it. We are face to face with the\r\npractical issue: Is it to go through ruin or reform? Can we forestall\r\nruin by reform? If we wait to be forced by events we shall be astounded\r\nto find how much more radical they are than our utopias. Louis XVI.\r\nwaited until 1793, and gave his head and all his investitures to the\r\npeople who in 1789 asked only to sit at his feet and speak their mind.\r\nUnless we reform of our own free will, nature will reform us by force,\r\nas nature does. Our evil courses have already gone too far in producing\r\nmisery, plagues, hatreds, national enervation. Already the leader is\r\nunable to lead, and has begun to drive with judges armed with bayonets\r\nand Gatling guns. History is the serial obituary of the men who thought\r\nthey could drive men.\r\n\r\nReform is the science and conscience with which mankind in its manhood\r\novercomes temptations and escapes consequences by killing the germs.\r\nRuin is already hard at work among us. Our libraries are full of the\r\nofficial inquiries and scientific interpretations which show how our\r\nmaster-motive is working decay in all our parts. The family crumbles\r\ninto a competition between the father and the children whom he breeds\r\nto take his place in the factory, to unfit themselves to be fathers in\r\ntheir turn. A thorough, stalwart resimplification, a life governed by\r\nsimple needs and loves, is the imperative want of the world. It will be\r\naccomplished: either self-conscious volition does it, or the slow wreck\r\nand decay of superfluous and unwholesome men and matters. The latter\r\nis the method of brutes and brute civilizations. The other is the\r\nmethod of man, so far as he is divine. Has not man, who has in personal\r\nreform risen above the brute method, come to the height at which he can\r\nachieve social reform in masses and by nations? We must learn; we can\r\nlearn by reason. Why wait for the cruder teacher?\r\n\r\nWe have a people like which none has ever existed before. We have\r\nmillions capable of conscious co-operation. The time must come in\r\nsocial evolution when the people can organize the free-will to choose\r\nsalvation which the individual has been cultivating for 1900 years,\r\nand can adopt a policy more dignified and more effective than leaving\r\nthemselves to be kicked along the path of reform by the recoil of their\r\nown vices. We must bring the size of our morality up to the size of our\r\ncities, corporations, and combinations, or these will be brought down\r\nto fit our half-grown virtue.\r\n\r\nIndustry and monopoly cannot live together. Our modern perfection of\r\nexchange and division of labor cannot last without equal perfection of\r\nmorals and sympathy. Every one is living at the mercy of every one else\r\nin a way entirely peculiar to our times. Nothing is any longer made by\r\na man; parts of things are made by parts of men, and become wholes by\r\nthe luck of a good-humor which so far keeps men from flying asunder.\r\nIt takes a whole company to make a match. A hundred men will easily\r\nproduce a hundred million matches, but not one of them could make one\r\nmatch. No farm gets its plough from the cross-roads blacksmith, and\r\nno one in the chilled-steel factory knows the whole of the plough.\r\nThe life of Boston hangs on a procession of reciprocities which must\r\nmove, as steadily and sweetly as the roll of the planets, between its\r\nbakeries, the Falls of St. Anthony, and the valley of the Red River.\r\nNever was there a social machinery so delicate. Only on terms of love\r\nand justice can men endure contact so close.\r\n\r\nThe break-down of all other civilizations has been a slow decay. It\r\ntook the Northerners hundreds of years to march to the Tiber. They\r\ngrew their way through the old society as the tree planting itself on\r\na grave is found to have sent its roots along every fibre and muscle\r\nof the dead. Our world is not the simple thing theirs was, of little\r\ngroups sufficient to themselves, if need be. New York would begin to\r\ndie to-morrow if it were not for Illinois and Dakota. We cannot afford\r\na revulsion in the hearts by whose union locomotives run, mills grind,\r\nfactories make. Practical men are speculating to-day on the possibility\r\nthat our civilization may some afternoon be flashed away by the tick of\r\na telegraph. All these co-operations can be scattered by a word of hate\r\ntoo many, and we left, with no one who knows how to make a plough or a\r\nmatch, a civilization cut off as by the Roman curse from food and fire.\r\nLess sensitive civilizations than ours have burst apart.\r\n\r\nLiberty and monopoly cannot live together. What chance have we against\r\nthe persistent coming and the easy coalescence of the confederated\r\ncliques, which aspire to say of all business, \"This belongs to us,\"\r\nand whose members, though moving among us as brothers, are using\r\nagainst us, through the corporate forms we have given them, powers\r\nof invisibility, of entail and accumulation, unprecedented because\r\nimpersonal and immortal, and, most peculiar of all, power to act as\r\npersons, as in the commission of crimes, with exemption from punishment\r\nas persons? Two classes study and practise politics and government:\r\nplace hunters and privilege hunters. In a world of relativities\r\nlike ours size of area has a great deal to do with the truth of\r\nprinciples. America has grown so big--and the tickets to be voted, and\r\nthe powers of government, and the duties of citizens, and the profits\r\nof personal use of public functions have all grown so big--that the\r\naverage citizen has broken down. No man can half understand or half\r\noperate the fulness of this big citizenship, except by giving his whole\r\ntime to it. This the place hunter can do, and the privilege hunter.\r\nGovernment, therefore--municipal, State, national--is passing into the\r\nhands of these two classes, specialized for the functions of power by\r\ntheir appetite for the fruits of power. The power of citizenship is\r\nrelinquished by those who do not and cannot know how to exercise it to\r\nthose who can and do--by those who have a livelihood to make to those\r\nwho make politics their livelihood.\r\n\r\nThese specialists of the ward club, the primary, the campaign, the\r\nelection, and office unite, by a law as irresistible as that of the\r\nsexes, with those who want all the goods of government--charters,\r\ncontracts, rulings, permits. From this marriage it is easy to imagine\r\nthat among some other people than ourselves, and in some other\r\ncentury than this, the off-spring might be the most formidable,\r\nelusive, unrestrained, impersonal, and cruel tyranny the world has\r\nyet seen. There might come a time when the policeman and the railroad\r\npresident would equally show that they cared nothing for the citizen,\r\nindividually or collectively, because aware that they and not he were\r\nthe government. Certainly such an attempt to corner \"the dear people\"\r\nand the earth and the fulness thereof will break down. It is for us\r\nto decide whether we will let it go on till it breaks down of itself,\r\ndragging down to die, as a savage dies of his vice, the civilization\r\nit has gripped with its hundred hands; or whether, while we are still\r\nyoung, still virtuous, we will break it down, self-consciously, as the\r\ncivilized man, reforming, crushes down the evil. If we cannot find a\r\nremedy, all that we love in the word America must die. It will be an\r\nawful price to pay if this attempt at government of the people, by the\r\npeople, for the people must perish from off the face of the earth\r\nto prove to mankind that political brotherhood cannot survive where\r\nindustrial brotherhood is denied. But the demonstration is worth even\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAristotle's lost books of the Republics told the story of two hundred\r\nand fifty attempts at free government, and these were but some of\r\nthe many that had to be melted down in the crucible of fate to teach\r\nHamilton and Jefferson what they knew. Perhaps we must be melted by the\r\nsame fierce flames to be a light to the feet of those who come after\r\nus. For as true as that a house divided against itself cannot stand,\r\nand that a nation half slave and half free cannot permanently endure,\r\nis it true that a people who are slaves to market-tyrants will surely\r\ncome to be their slaves in all else, that all liberty begins to be\r\nlost when one liberty is lost, that a people half democratic and half\r\nplutocratic cannot permanently endure.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the history we are about to make is not that the world is\r\npoorer or worse. It is richer and better. Its new wealth is too great\r\nfor the old forms. The success and beauties of our old mutualities\r\nhave made us ready for new mutualities. The wonder of to-day is the\r\nmodern multiplication of products by the union of forces; the marvel\r\nof to-morrow will be the greater product which will follow when that\r\nwhich is co-operatively produced is co-operatively enjoyed. It is the\r\nspectacle of its concentration in the private fortunes of our day which\r\nreveals this wealth to its real makers--the whole people--and summons\r\nthem to extend the manners and institutions of civilization to this new\r\ntribal relation.\r\n\r\nWhether the great change comes with peace or sword, freely through\r\nreform or by nature's involuntary forces, is a mere matter of detail,\r\na question of convenience--not of the essence of the thing. The change\r\nwill come. With reform, it may come to us. If with force, perhaps not\r\nto us. But it will come. The world is too full of amateurs who can play\r\nthe golden rule as an aria with variations. All the runs and trills\r\nand transpositions have been done to death. All the \"sayings\" have\r\nbeen said. The only field for new effects is in epigrams of practice.\r\nTitillation of our sympathies has become a dissipation. We shed a daily\r\ntear over the misery of the slums as the toper takes his dram, and our\r\nliver becomes torpid with the floods of indignation and sentiment we\r\nhave guzzled without converting them into their co-efficients of action.\r\n\r\n\"Regenerate the individual\" is a half-truth; the reorganization of the\r\nsociety which he makes and which makes him is the other half. Man alone\r\ncannot be a Christian. Institutions are applied beliefs. The love of\r\nliberty became liberty in America by clothing itself in the complicated\r\ngroup of structures known as the government of the United States. Love\r\nis a half-truth, and kissing is a good deal less than half of that.\r\nWe need not kiss all our fellow-men, but we must do for them all we\r\nask them to do for us--nothing less than the fullest performance of\r\nevery power. To love our neighbor is to submit to the discipline and\r\narrangement which make his life reach its best, and so do we best love\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nHistory has taught us nothing if not that men can continue to associate\r\nonly by the laws of association. The golden rule is the first and last\r\nof these, but the first and last of the golden rule is that it can\r\nbe operated only through laws, habits, forms, and institutions. The\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States are, however imperfectly,\r\nthe translation into the language of politics of doing as you would be\r\ndone by--the essence of equal rights and government by consent. To ask\r\nindividuals to-day to lead by their single sacrifices the life of the\r\nbrother in the world of business is as if the American colonist had\r\nbeen asked to lead by his individual enterprise the life of the citizen\r\nof a republic. That was made possible to him only by union with others.\r\nThe business world is full of men who yearn to abandon its methods and\r\nlive the love they feel; but to attempt to do so by themselves would be\r\nmartyrdom, and that is \"caviare to the general.\" \"We admire martyrdom,\"\r\nMazzini, the martyr, said, \"but we do not recommend it.\" The change\r\nmust be social, and its martyrdoms have already begun.\r\n\r\nThe new self-interest will remain unenforced in business until we\r\ninvent the forms by which the vast multitudes who have been gathered\r\ntogether in modern production can organize themselves into a people\r\nthere as in government. Nothing but this institutionalization will save\r\nthem from being scattered away from each other again, and it can be\r\nachieved only by such averaging and concessions and co-operations as\r\nare the price of all union. These will be gains, not losses. Soldiers\r\nbecome partners in invincibility by the discipline which adopts an\r\naverage rate of march instead of compelling all to keep step with the\r\nfastest and stay with the strongest. Moralists tell men to love each\r\nother and the right. How, by doing what things, by leaving what undone,\r\nshall men love each other? What have the ethicals to say upon the\r\nmorality of putting public highways in private hands, and of allowing\r\nthese private hands to make a private and privileged use of them? If\r\nbad, will a mere \"change of heart,\" uninstitutionalized, change them?\r\n\r\nNew freedoms cannot be operated through the old forms of slavery. The\r\nideals of Washington and Hamilton and Adams could not breathe under\r\nkingly rule. Idle to say they might. Under the mutual dependence of\r\nthe inside and outside of things their change has all through history\r\nalways been dual. Change of heart is no more redemption than hunger\r\nis dinner. We must have honesty, love, justice in the heart of the\r\nbusiness world, but for these we must also have the forms which will\r\nfit them. These will be very different from those through which the\r\nintercourse of man with man in the exchange of services now moves to\r\nsuch ungracious ends. Forms of Asiatic and American government, of\r\nearly institutions and to-day's, are not more different. The cardinal\r\nvirtues cannot be established and kept at work in trade and on the\r\nhighways with the old apparatus. In order that the spirit that gave\r\nrebates may go to stay, the rebate itself must go. If the private\r\nuse of private ownership of highways is to go, the private ownership\r\nmust go. There must be no private use of public power or public\r\nproperty. These are created by the common sacrifices of all, and\r\ncan be rightfully used only for the common good of all--from all, by\r\nall, for all. All the grants and franchises that have been given to\r\nprivate hands for private profit are void in morals and void in that\r\nhigher law which sets the copy for the laggard pens of legislatures and\r\njudges. \"No private use of public powers\" is but a threshold truth. The\r\nuniverse, says Emerson, is the property of every creature in it.\r\n\r\nNo home so low it may not hope that out of its fledglings one may grow\r\nthe hooked claw that will make him a millionaire. To any adventurer\r\nof spirit and prowess in the Italy of the Renaissance might come\r\nthe possibility of butchering or poisoning his way to a castle or a\r\nthrone. Such prizes of power made the peninsula a menagerie of tyrants,\r\nmurderers, voluptuaries, and multitudes of misery. We got republican\r\nliberty by agreeing each with the other never to seek to become kings\r\nor lords or dukes. We can get industrial and economic liberty only by a\r\nlike covenant never to let ourselves or any one else be millionaires.\r\n\r\nThere can be no public prosperity without public virtue, and no public\r\nvirtue without private virtue. But private cannot become public except\r\nby organization. Our attempts at control, regulation, are but the\r\nagitations of the Gracchi, evidencing the wrong, but not rising to the\r\ncure. We are waiting for some genius of good who will generalize into\r\none body of doctrine our partial truths of reform, and will help us\r\nlive the generalization. Never was mankind, across all lines of race,\r\ncreed, and institutions, more nearly one in discontent and restless\r\nconsciousness of new powers and a new hope and purpose, never more\r\nwidely agitated by influences leading in one direction, never more\r\nnearly a committee of the whole on the question of the day. Never\r\nbefore were the means for flashing one thought into the minds of the\r\nmillion, and flashing that thought into action, what they are to-day.\r\nThe good word or good deed of Chicago in the morning may be the\r\ninspiration of Calcutta before nightfall. The crusades were but an eddy\r\nin comparison with the universal tide waiting for another Peter the\r\nHermit to lead us where the Man who is to rise again lies in the hands\r\nof the infidel.\r\n\r\nOur problem can be read from its good side or its bad, and must be read\r\nfrom both, as: Business has become a vice, and defeats us and itself;\r\nor, Humanity quickens its step to add to its fellowships the new\r\nbrotherhood of labor. The next emancipation, like all emancipations,\r\nmust destroy and build. The most constructive thinker in history\r\nsaid, Love one another; but he also drove the money-changers from the\r\ntemple, and denounced the scribes and Pharisees, and has been busy for\r\nnineteen hundred years pulling down tenements unfit for the habitation\r\nof the soul. We see something new and something old. Old principles\r\nrun into mania, a wicked old world bursting into suicidal explosion,\r\nas Carlyle said of the French Revolution. New loves, new capabilities,\r\nnew institutions, created by the expansion of old ideals and new\r\nopportunities of human contact. Our love of those to whom we have been\r\n\"introduced\" is but unlocking a door through which all men will pass\r\ninto our hearts. What makes men lovable is not the accident of our\r\nknowing them. It is that they are men. Before 1776 there were thirteen\r\npatriotisms in America.\r\n\r\nThe bishops of Boswell's day had no ear for the lamentations of the\r\nvictims of the slave-trade, but there came a new sympathy which rose\r\nsuperior to their divine displeasure that this commerce of Christian\r\nmerchants should be attacked. We are coming to sympathize with the\r\nanimals, and Queen Victoria contributes money to a hospital for the\r\nsuccor of decayed old gentlemen and lady cats. By-and-by royal hearts\r\nmay widen to include men and women evicted in Ireland, or--worse\r\nfate--not evicted from Whitechapel. The spirit that defended the\r\nslave-trade now finds its last ditch behind the text, The poor ye\r\nhave with you always. But a new sympathy rises again, like that which\r\ndeclared that the poor should be free of the slave-trade and slavery,\r\nand declares that the poor shall be freed from starvation of body,\r\nmind, and soul. Slave-trade, slavery, poverty; the form varies, but\r\nagainst them all runs the refusal of the human heart to be made happy\r\nat the cost of the misery of others, and its mathematical knowledge\r\nthat its quotient of satisfactions will increase with the sum of the\r\nhappiness of all.\r\n\r\nThe word of the day is that we are about to civilize industry.\r\nMankind is quivering with its purpose to make men fellow-citizens,\r\nbrothers, lovers in industry, as it has done with them in government\r\nand family, which are also industry. We already have on our shelves\r\nthe sciences--hygienic, industrial, political, ethical--to free the\r\nworld almost at a stroke from war, accidents, disease, poverty,\r\nand their flowing vices and insanities. The men of these sciences\r\nare here at call praying for employment. The people, by the books\r\nthey read, show themselves to be praying to have them put at work.\r\nIf we who call ourselves civilization would for one average span\r\ndevote to life-dealing the moneys, armies, and genius we now give\r\nto death-dealing, and would establish over the weaker peoples a\r\nprotectorate of the United States of Europe and America, we would take\r\na long step towards settling forever the vexed question of the site of\r\nthe Garden of Eden.\r\n\r\n\"Human nature,\" \"monotony,\" and \"individuality\" are the lions which\r\nthe reformer is always told will stop the way to a better world. \"You\r\ncannot change human nature.\" There are two human natures--the human\r\nnature of Christ and of Judas; and Christ prevails. There is the human\r\nnature which seeks anonymity, secrecy, the fruits of power without\r\nits duties; and there is the human nature which rises against these\r\nand, province by province, is abolishing them from human affairs. Men\r\nhave always been willing to die for their faith. The bad have died as\r\nbravely as the good, Charles I. with as smooth a front as Sir Harry\r\nVane. In this readiness to die lies folded every loyalty of life.\r\n\r\n\"You would make the world a dead level of monotony.\" Good society does\r\nnot think it monotonous that all its women should at the same time dust\r\nthe streets with long-tailed gowns, or that its men should meet every\r\nnight in funereal black and identical cut, but it shrinks from the\r\nmonotony of having all share in reforms which would equalize surfeit\r\nand starvation. \"Good society\" is still to come, and it will find some\r\nbetter definition of \"monotony\" than a fair share for all--a better\r\ndefinition of variety than too much for ourselves at the cost of too\r\nlittle for all others. Shall we choose the monotony of sharing with\r\nevery one under George III. or Alexander II. the denial of all right to\r\nparticipate in the supreme power, or shall we choose the monotony of\r\nsharing with every fellow-citizen the right to become President?--the\r\nmonotony of being forbidden to enter all the great livelihoods, some\r\nsyndicate blocking each way with \"This business belongs to us\"? Or the\r\nmonotony of a democracy, where every laborer has equal rights with all\r\nother citizens to decide upon the administration of the common toil for\r\nthe common welfare, and an equal right with every other to rise to be a\r\nCaptain of Industry? Such are the alternatives of \"monotony.\" We have\r\nmade an historic choice in one; now for the other.\r\n\r\nAnd \"individuality.\" \"You are going to destroy individuality.\" We can\r\nbecome individual only by submitting to be bound to others. We extend\r\nour freedom only by finding new laws to obey. Life outside the law is\r\nslavery on as many sides as there are disregarded laws. The locomotive\r\noff its tracks is not free. The more relations, ties, duties, the\r\nmore \"individual.\" The isolated man is the mere rudiment of an\r\nindividual. But he who has become citizen, neighbor, friend, brother,\r\nson, husband, father, fellow-member, in one, is just by so many times\r\nindividualized. Men's expanding powers of co-operation bring them to\r\nthe conscious ability to unite for new benefits; but this extension of\r\nindividuality is forbidden in the name of individuality. There are two\r\nindividualities: that of the dullard, who submits to take his railroad\r\ntransportation, his light, his coal, his salt, his reaping-machine at\r\nsuch prices and of such quality as arbitrary power forces upon him, and\r\nthat of the shrewder man who, by an alliance of the individualities of\r\nall, supplies himself at his own price.\r\n\r\nTime carries us so easily we do not realize how fast we move. This\r\nsocial debate has gone far beyond the question whether change there\r\nmust be. What shall the change be? is the subject all the world is\r\ndiscussing. Exposure of abuses no longer excites more than a languid\r\ninterest. But every clear plan how things might be rearranged raises\r\nthe people. Before every revolution marches a book--the _Contrat\r\nSocial_, _Uncle Tom's Cabin_. \"Every man nowadays,\" says Emerson,\r\n\"carries a revolution in his vest-pocket.\" The book which sells more\r\ncopies than any other of our day abroad and at home, debated by all\r\ndown to the boot-blacks as they sit on the curb-stones, is one calling\r\nmen to draw from their success in insuring each other some of the\r\nnecessaries of life the courage to move on to insure each other all\r\nthe necessaries of life, bidding them abandon the self-defeating\r\nanarchy which puts railroad-wreckers at the head of railroads and\r\nfamine-producers at the head of production, and inspiring them to share\r\nthe common toil and the fruits of the toil under the ideals which make\r\nmen Washingtons and Lincolns. You may question the importance of the\r\nplan; you cannot question the importance of its welcome. It shows the\r\npeople gathering-points for the new constitution they know they must\r\nmake.\r\n\r\nIn nothing has liberty justified itself more thoroughly than in the\r\nresolute determination spreading among the American people to add\r\nindustrial to political independence. It is the hope of the world that\r\ngood has its effects as well as evil, and that on the whole, and in\r\nthe long-run, the seed of the good will overgrow the evil. \"Heaven has\r\nkindly given our blood a moral flow.\" Liberty breeds liberties, slavery\r\nbreeds slaveries, but the liberties will be the strongest stock. If\r\nthe political and religious liberties which the people of this country\r\naspired to set up had in them the real sap and fibre of a better life\r\nthan the world had yet known, it must certainly follow that they\r\nwould quicken and strengthen the people for discovery and obedience\r\nin still higher realms. And just this has happened. Nowhere else has\r\nthe new claim to tax without representation been so quickly detected,\r\nso intelligently scrutinized, and so bravely fought. Nowhere else has\r\nthis spreading plague of selfishness and false doctrine found a people\r\nwhose average and general life was pitched on so high a level that they\r\ninstantly took the alarm at its claims over their lives and liberties.\r\nIt has found a people so disciplined by the aspiration and achievement\r\nof political and religious rights that they are already possessed of\r\na body of doctrine capable, by an easy extension, of refuting all the\r\npretensions of the new absolutism. At the very beginning of this new\r\ndemocratic life among the nations it was understood that to be safe\r\nliberty must be complete on its industrial as well as on its political\r\nand religious sides. This is the American principle. \"Give a man power\r\nover my subsistence,\" said Alexander Hamilton, \"and he has power over\r\nthe whole of my moral being.\" To submit to such a power gives only the\r\nalternative of death or degradation, and the high spirit of America\r\npreferred then, as it prefers now, the rule of right, which gives life.\r\n\r\nThe mania of business has reached an acuter and extremer development\r\nin America than elsewhere, because nowhere else have bounteous nature\r\nand free institutions produced birthrights and pottages so well worth\r\n\"swapping.\" But the follies and wickedness of business have nowhere\r\nbeen so sharply challenged as in free America. \"Betake yourself to\r\nAmerica,\" said Carlyle to a friend beginning a literary career; \"there\r\nyou can utter your freest thoughts in ways impossible here.\" It is to\r\nthis stern wakefulness of a free people that the world owes it that\r\nmore light has been thrown in America than in any other country on the\r\nprocesses of modern money-making. A free press, organ of a free people,\r\nhas done invaluable service. The legislatures have pushed investigation\r\nafter investigation into the ways in which large masses of the people\r\nhave been deprived, for the benefit of single men or groups of men,\r\nof rights of subsistence and government. Through the courts the free\r\npeople have pursued their depredators by civil and criminal process, by\r\npublic and private prosecutions. Imperfect and corrupt, these agencies\r\nof press, courts, legislatures have often been; they have still done a\r\nwork which has either been left undone altogether in other countries,\r\nor has been done with but a fraction of our thoroughness.\r\n\r\nIt is due to them that there exists in the reports of legislative\r\ninvestigations, State and national, in the proceedings of lawsuits and\r\ncriminal trials, in the files of the newspapers, a mass of information\r\nwhich cannot be found in any other community in the world. There is in\r\nthese archives an accumulation of the raw material of tragedy, comedy,\r\nromance, ravellings of the vicissitudes of human life, and social\r\nand personal fate, which will feed the fires of whole generations of\r\nliterary men when once they awake to the existence of these precious\r\nrolls. In these pigeon-holes are to be found keys of the present and\r\nclews to the future. As America has the newest and widest liberty, it\r\nis the stage where play the newest and widest forces of evil as well as\r\ngood. America is at the front of the forward line of evolution. It has\r\ntaken the lead in developing competition to the extreme form in which\r\nit destroys competition, and in superfining the processes of exchange\r\nof services into those of the acquisition of the property of others\r\nwithout service.\r\n\r\nThe hope is that the old economic system we inherited has ripened so\r\nmuch more rapidly than the society and government we have created that\r\nthe dead matter it deposits can be thrown off by our vigorous youth and\r\nhealth. \"It is high time our bad wealth came to an end,\" says Emerson.\r\nIt has grown into its monstrous forms so fast that the dullest eye can\r\nseparate it from the Commonwealth, and the slowest mind comprehend its\r\nmischievousness. In making themselves free of arbitrary and corrupt\r\npower in government the Americans prepared themselves to be free in all\r\nelse, and because foremost in political liberty they have the promise\r\nof being the first to realize industrial liberty--the trunk of a tree\r\nof which political liberty is the seed, and without which political\r\nliberty shrinks back into nothingness.\r\n\r\n\"The art of Italy will blossom over our graves,\" Mazzini said when,\r\nwith true insight, he saw that the first artistic, first literary task\r\nbefore the Italians was to make their country free. Art, literature,\r\nculture, religion, in America, are already beginning to feel the\r\nrestrictive pressure which results from the domination of a selfish,\r\nself-indulgent, luxurious, and anti-social power. This power, mastering\r\nthe markets of a civilization which gives its main energies to markets,\r\npasses without difficulty to the mastery of all the other activities.\r\nWhen churches, political campaigns, the expounding of the law,\r\nmaintenance of schools and colleges, and family life itself all depend\r\non money, they must become servile to the money power. Song, picture,\r\nsermon, decrees of court, and the union of hearts must pass constantly\r\nunder stronger control of those who give their lives to trade and\r\nencourage everybody else to trade, confident that the issue of it all\r\nwill be that they will hold as property, in exclusive possession, to be\r\ndoled out on their own terms, the matter by which alone man can live,\r\neither materially or spiritually.\r\n\r\nIn America, where the supreme political power and much of the\r\ngovernment of church and college have been taken out of traditional\r\nhands and subjected to the changing determinations of popular will, it\r\nhas inevitably resulted that the State, church, and school have passed\r\nunder this mercantile aristocracy to a far greater extent than in\r\nother countries where stiffer régimes under other and older influences\r\nstill stand. Our upper classes--elected, as always, by the equipoise\r\nof effort and opinion between them and the lower classes--are, under\r\nthis commercial system, the men who trade best, who can control their\r\nfeatures and their consciences so that they can always get more than\r\nthey give, who can play with supply and demand so that at the end of\r\nthe game all their brethren are their tributaries for life. It is the\r\nbirthright-buying minds that, by the adoption of this ideal, we choose\r\nfor our rulers. The progressive races have altered their ideals of\r\nkings with the indescribable advantage of being ruled by Washingtons\r\nand Lincolns and Gladstones instead of Caligulas and Pharaohs. We\r\nhave now to make a similar step forward in another part of life. The\r\nprevious changes expressed outwardly an inner change of heart. The\r\nreformer of to-day is simply he who, with quicker ear, detecting that\r\nanother change of heart is going on, goes before.\r\n\r\nAnother great change is working in the inner mind of man, and will\r\nsurely be followed by incorporation in institutions and morals and\r\nmanners. The social head and heart are both being persuaded that too\r\nmany are idle--rich and poor; too many are hurt in body and soul--rich\r\nand poor; too many children are \"exposed,\" as in the old Greek and\r\nRoman market-places; too many are starving within reach of too much\r\nfertile waste; too many passions of envy, greed, and hate are raging\r\namong rich and poor. There is too much left undone that ought to be\r\ndone along the whole scale of life, from the lowest physical to the\r\nhighest spiritual needs, from better roads to sweeter music and nobler\r\nworship. It cannot be long, historically speaking, before all this\r\nnew sense and sentiment will issue in acts. All will be as zealously\r\nprotected against the oppression of the cruel in their daily labor\r\nas now against oppression from invader or rioter, and will be as\r\nwarmly cheered in liberty to grow to their fullest capabilities as\r\nlaborers--_i.e._, users of matter for the purpose of the spirit--as\r\nthey are now welcomed to the liberty of the citizen and the worshipper.\r\nInfinite is the fountain of our rights. We can have all the rights we\r\nwill create. All the rights we will give we can have. The American\r\npeople will save the liberties they have inherited by winning new ones\r\nto bequeath.\r\n\r\nWith this will come fruits of new faculty almost beyond calculation.\r\nA new liberty will put an end to pauperism and millionairism and the\r\ncrimes and death-rate born of both wretchednesses, just as the liberty\r\nof politics and religion put an end to martyrs and tyrants. The new\r\nliberty is identical in principle and purpose with the other; it is\r\nmade inevitable by them. Those who love the liberties already won must\r\nopen the door to the new, unless they wish to see them all take flight\r\ntogether. There can be no single liberty. Liberties go in clusters like\r\nthe Pleiades.\r\n\r\nWe must either regulate, or own, or destroy, perishing by the sword\r\nwe take. The possibility of regulation is a dream. As long as this\r\ncontrol of the necessaries of life and this wealth remain private\r\nwith individuals, it is they who will regulate, not we. The policy\r\nof regulation, disguise it as we may, is but moving to a compromise\r\nand equilibrium within the evil all complain of. It is to accept the\r\nprinciple of the sovereignty of the self-interest of the individual and\r\napply constitutional checks to it. The unprogressive nations palter\r\nin this method with monarchy. But the wits of America are equal to\r\nseeing that as with kingship and slavery so with poverty--the weeding\r\nmust be done at the roots. Sir Henry Sumner Maine says mankind moves\r\nfrom status to contract; from society ruled by inherited customs to\r\none ruled by agreement, varied according to circumstances. Present\r\nexperience suggests the addition that the movement, like all in\r\nnature, is pendulous, and that mankind moves progressively from status\r\nto contract, and from this stage of contract to another status. We\r\nmarch and rest and march again. If our society is settling down to an\r\ninterval of inertia, perhaps ages long, we must before night comes\r\nestablish all in as much equality and comfort as possible.\r\n\r\nThe aspirations are not new. We have had them since Plato. The\r\nknowledge of means for realizing them is not new. We have had it since\r\nAristotle, and the history of civilization is but the record of the\r\nprogressive embodiment of the ideals in institutions for the life\r\ntogether--sexual, social, spiritual. What is new in our moment is that\r\nmankind's accumulating forces are preparing for another step forward\r\nin this long processional realization of its best possible. Nothing\r\nso narrow as the mere governmentalizing of the means and processes of\r\nproduction. It is only the morally nerveless who ask government to\r\ndo that which they will not rise to do. The conversion which is now\r\nworking itself out within us, and perhaps is more nearly born than we\r\nsuspect (\"We shall not live to see slavery abolished,\" said Emerson, in\r\n1859) is making itself felt on all sides of our life. In manners, in\r\nliterature, in marriage, in church, in all, we see at work the saving\r\nferment which is to make all things new by bringing them nearer to\r\nthe old ideals. George Sand was revolted by the servile accent of the\r\nphrase of her day, \"Madame est servie.\" Society has grown to the better\r\nfellowship her finer ear found wanting in these words, and is now told\r\nit is dinner, not madame or monsieur, that is served.\r\n\r\nWe are to have, of course, great political changes. We are to apply\r\nthe co-operative methods of the post-office and the public school to\r\nmany other common toils, to all toils in which private sovereignty has\r\nbecome through monopoly a despotism over the public, and to all in\r\nwhich the association of the people and the organization of processes\r\nhave been so far developed that the profit-hunting Captain of Industry\r\nmay be replaced by the public-serving Captain of Industry. But we are\r\nto have much more. We are to have a private life of a new beauty, of\r\nwhich these are to be merely the mechanical exhibitions on the side\r\nof politics. We are to move among each other, able, by the methodical\r\nand agreed adherence of all, to do what the words of Lamennais mean,\r\ninstead of being able, as now, in most things, to afford only an\r\nindulgence in feeling them. We are to be commoners, travellers to\r\nAltruria.\r\n\r\nWe are to become fathers, mothers, for the spirit of the father and\r\nmother is not in us while we can say of any child it is not ours, and\r\nleave it in the grime. We are to become men, women, for to all about\r\nreinforcing us we shall insure full growth and thus insure it to\r\nourselves. We are to become gentlemen, ladies, for we will not accept\r\nfrom another any service we are not willing to return in kind. We are\r\nto become honest, giving when we get, and getting with the knowledge\r\nand consent of all. We are to become rich, for we shall share in the\r\nwealth now latent in idle men and idle land, and in the fertility of\r\nwork done by those who have ceased to withstand but stand with each\r\nother. As we walk our parks we already see that by saying \"thine\" to\r\nevery neighbor we say \"mine\" of palaces, gardens, art, science, far\r\nbeyond any possible to selfishness, even the selfishness of kings.\r\nWe shall become patriots, for the heart will know why it thrills to\r\nthe flag. Those folds wave the salute of a greater love than that of\r\nthe man who will lay down his life for his friend. There floats the\r\nbanner of the love of millions, who, though they do not know you and\r\nhave never seen you, will die for you and are living for you, doing\r\nin a thousand services unto you as you would be done by. And the\r\nlittle patriotism, which is the love of the humanity fenced within our\r\nfrontier will widen into the reciprocal service of all men. Generals\r\nwere, merchants are, brothers will be, humanity's representative men.\r\n\r\nThere is to be a people in industry, as in government. The same rising\r\ngenius of democracy which discovered that mankind did not co-operate in\r\nthe State to provide a few with palaces and king's-evil, is disclosing\r\nthat men do not co-operate in trade for any other purpose than to\r\nmobilize the labor of all for the benefit of all, and that the only\r\ntrue guidance comes from those who are led, and the only valid titles\r\nfrom those who create. Very wide must be the emancipation of this new\r\nself-interest. If we free America we shall still be not free, for the\r\nfinancial, commercial, possessory powers of modern industrial life are\r\norganized internationally. If we rose to the full execution of the\r\nfirst, simplest, and most pressing need of our times and put an end\r\nto all private use of public powers, we should still be confronted by\r\nmonopolies existing simply as private property, as in coal-mines, oil\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nIt is not a verbal accident that science is the substance of the word\r\nconscience. We must know the right before we can do the right. When it\r\ncomes to know the facts the human heart can no more endure monopoly\r\nthan American slavery or Roman empire. The first step to a remedy is\r\nthat the people care. If they know, they will care. To help them to\r\nknow and care; to stimulate new hatred of evil, new love of the good,\r\nnew sympathy for the victims of power, and, by enlarging its science,\r\nto quicken the old into a new conscience, this compilation of fact\r\nhas been made. Democracy is not a lie. There live in the body of the\r\ncommonalty the unexhausted virtue and the ever-refreshened strength\r\nwhich can rise equal to any problems of progress. In the hope of\r\ntapping some reserve of their powers of self-help this story is told to\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nPARTIAL LIST OF TRADE COMBINATIONS, OR TRUSTS, ACHIEVED OR ATTEMPTED,\r\nAND OF THE COMMODITIES COVERED BY THEM[770]\r\n\r\n\r\n I.--LIGHT, HEAT, AND POWER\r\n\r\n Boilers, for house heating.\r\n\r\n Candle-makers, Great Britain, United States.\r\n\r\n Coal: anthracite, bituminous.\r\n\r\n Coke.\r\n\r\n Electric: carbon points, 1885;\r\n   candles,1888;\r\n   electric goods, national, 1887;\r\n   lighting, United States, Great Britain, 1882;\r\n   light-fixtures, national, 1889.\r\n\r\n Gas: illuminating and fuel, local, sectional, national;

Lloyd in a book entitled _A Strike of Millionaires against\r\n Miners_. It merits no less a volume than this. It is not an isolated\r\n case--an industrial phenomenon springing from conditions rarely\r\n repeated--but one of many similar cases, a part only of the whole\r\n story of coal mining in the United States. More than this, it is an\r\n aggravated illustration of the soullessness of the corporation in\r\n general, through the agency of which the bulk of the producing powers\r\n of the nation is working.\r\n\r\n Behind this legal fiction men hide and do deeds of grasping cruelty\r\n that disgrace manhood, and are fast bringing the industrial organism\r\n into contempt. In the case of Spring Valley, the directors and\r\n stockholders of the Chicago and North-Western Railroad and the Spring\r\n Valley Coal Company--controlled by the same men--are as responsible\r\n for the sufferings and death from starvation of miners in Spring\r\n Valley in 1889 as if they had all been personally present and assisted\r\n in the business of bringing men from a distance to work in their mines\r\n on assurance of steady employment, and then of locking them out\r\n without warning, to starve them into submission to lower wages, for\r\n the sake of higher profits on their stock. This is the conclusion of\r\n Mr. Lloyd, and we see no escape from it.\r\n\r\n If the corporation is to be considered an impersonality without moral\r\n responsibility, it will either have to go, or the industrial system\r\n which makes it an essential part will have to go. All the power of\r\n government, or wealth, or vested interests cannot maintain that\r\n system which, resting as our present system must on the charitable\r\n instincts of men, offers a way of escape from the responsibilities\r\n imposed thereby to the most powerful factors of the society. Against\r\n that system \"the pulses of men will beat until they beat it down.\"\r\n What must be the condition of that society which allows the wealthy\r\n capitalists who starved these thousands of miners not only to go\r\n unpunished, but to move in the very highest circles of business power\r\n and social influence? And one of them in particular is to-day figuring\r\n upon representing the Democratic party of Pennsylvania in the United\r\n States Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York _Commercial Advertiser_ (editorial).\r\n\r\n It is to be remembered that Mr. Lloyd's book does not profess to be\r\n a dispassionate review of the situation. It is an indictment. The\r\n corporation's side should be given a fair hearing. But it must be\r\n heard soon. Mr. Lloyd's charges are too important, his formulation\r\n of them too worthy of respect to be treated with silent contempt. To\r\n ignore them is to confess their truth. Should such a reply be made,\r\n the readers of this column will be informed of it. _A Strike of\r\n Millionaires against Miners_ describes the poverty, the suffering, the\r\n utter misery among the miners in Spring Valley, Illinois, during the\r\n past year. In the simplicity and restraint of his style, and in the\r\n massing of his facts, Mr. Lloyd shows genuine literary power. There is\r\n no attempt at rhetoric in his narrative. He depends upon statements\r\n of facts, many of them incontrovertible, to rouse the hot indignation\r\n of his readers. If the story is true, and it bears every appearance\r\n of truth, the Spring Valley mine owners have been guilty of damnable\r\n treachery and cruelty to their fellow-men.\r\n\r\n\r\nChicago _Herald_ (editorial).\r\n\r\n The _Herald_ commends to the attention of its readers the open\r\n letter in another column, from Henry D. Lloyd, addressed to various\r\n millionaires of New York, Chicago, and St. Paul. It contains what the\r\n _Herald_ believes to be the truth as to the Spring Valley scandal,\r\n and while in most respects it is a plain statement of facts, it is\r\n nevertheless one of the most powerful appeals for justice, and one of\r\n the most eloquent denunciations of wrong, which has come under the\r\n public eye in many a day.\r\n\r\n Mr. Lloyd's high character, his superb attainments, and his well-known\r\n philanthropy give force to the arraignment it might not otherwise\r\n possess. His letter is a history of a crime--a crime resulting, no\r\n doubt, from an infamous conspiracy--and the story leads naturally and\r\n inevitably to the conclusion which Mr. Lloyd avows, that there must\r\n be conspiracy laws for millionaires as well as for working-men.\r\n\r\n Civilization must be bottomed on justice, or it cannot endure. A\r\n society which permits such inhuman outrages as that at Spring Valley\r\n is either asleep or in an advanced stage of decay. The money god\r\n cannot crush out the lives of human beings with impunity. Let its\r\n devotees look well to the ground on which they stand. The wise and\r\n humane will be warned in time. The foolish and insatiate must be left\r\n to the stern judgment of their fellow-men, who must some day pass upon\r\n their act.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Labor World_, London, England.\r\n\r\n What does Mr. Andrew Carnegie, who chants vulgar pæans to \"Triumphant\r\n Democracy\" say to such a book as this of Mr. Lloyd? This story of the\r\n robbery and betrayal of thousands of working miners in Illinois by\r\n a great millionaire corporation is one of the worst things we have\r\n read for a long time, and is a terribly scathing satire on American\r\n \"democracy.\"\r\n\r\n Let us hear no more trash about \"free\" America as compared with\r\n down-trodden Europe. Both continents are down-trodden by the rich\r\n men who own the raw material out of which wealth is created by human\r\n labor. When the land of the United States is all absorbed by private\r\n persons, as it will be in twenty years' time, there will not be a\r\n pin to choose between America and Europe, so far as wage-workers are\r\n concerned. Wages may be higher in America, but the increased cost of\r\n living there will nearly equalize the condition of the two continents;\r\n while for swindling, lying, and merciless oppression many American\r\n capitalists leave their European brethren far behind. Mr. Lloyd's\r\n book, which is the first of a new \"Bad Wealth Series,\" ought to open\r\n men's eyes to the fact that true freedom is impossible when a few men\r\n have a right to appropriate to themselves the raw material of the\r\n globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nChicago _Daily Inter-Ocean_.\r\n\r\n Mr. Lloyd's reputation as a writer on economic questions is\r\n sustained in the manner of handling the usually dry statistical\r\n matter which tells the story of strikes and lock-outs. He makes the\r\n story interesting and often graphic, while he gives the facts and\r\n figures relating to the intricacy of contracts in a way to be easily\r\n understood by the ordinary reader. The book is a valuable compilation\r\n of the facts gathered relating to this shameless abuse of corporative\r\n power in Spring Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _New Ideal_.\r\n\r\n Mr. Lloyd has been until recently on the editorial staff of the\r\n Chicago _Tribune_, and is now devoting his time to first-hand\r\n investigations into labor troubles. This book gives an account of a\r\n lock-out in one of the mining districts of Illinois, and is the more\r\n forcible and eloquent an arraignment of the \"millionaires,\" as the\r\n statements are throughout verifiable. As Mr. Lloyd in effect says,\r\n professors of political economy do not come near enough to realities\r\n to discover such details as he portrays, and the working-men do not\r\n know how to bring them before public opinion. Hence the necessity of\r\n a mediator, who shall thoroughly investigate the facts and at the\r\n same time give them to the public, not in statistical reports, but in\r\n a form that compels its attention. Mr. Lloyd is a practised writer;\r\n no one can read this narrative without being profoundly moved, and\r\n for the directors and stockholders of the Spring Valley Coal Company\r\n (and, besides, of the Chicago and North-Western Railway, an aider\r\n and abettor of the nefarious business) the effect must be to set\r\n their blood on fire--so far as they are blessed (or unblessed) with\r\n any moral sensitiveness. Every thoughtful citizen--whether man or\r\n woman--should read this book, and have fully brought home to him or\r\n her the problems it suggests. It belongs to the literature both of\r\n fact and of power.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Religio-Philosophical Journal_.\r\n\r\n Mr. Lloyd admits that Spring Valley and its miseries and wrongs were,\r\n at the beginning, but the conception and achievement of one or two\r\n of the leading owners of railroad and other companies who did the\r\n planning, secured the approval of the Board of Directors, and the\r\n active influence of the railroads through whom, by special freights,\r\n the business of competitors was stolen, coal land was bought, and\r\n the scheme was invented by which fortunes were to be made from\r\n working-men's necessities and the misuse of the powers of the common\r\n carrier. But none of the directors, none of the stockholders, who\r\n received the profits of the scheme, protested against it; on the\r\n contrary, all accepted unprotestingly their \"share of the guilt and\r\n gilt.\" Mr. Lloyd gives a mass of facts and figures which prove, on\r\n the part of corporations employing men at Spring Valley, an amount\r\n of greed and heartlessness which seems incredible in an enlightened\r\n country.\r\n\r\n Mr. Lloyd is a literary artist as well as a man of deep feeling,\r\n and he combines felicity of diction with fervor and eloquence of\r\n expression, and writes with effectiveness and power. The book should\r\n be read by all who are interested in the labor question--the practical\r\n issue of the hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nChicago _Times_.\r\n\r\n It is a pitiful story, a heart-breaking story, and Mr. Lloyd tells it\r\n with a great deal of force and earnestness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Dawn_.\r\n\r\n Can it be possible in these happier days among men who share the\r\n Christian civilization of the very eve of the twentieth century,\r\n that there can exist any analogy to this relentless war of savagery,\r\n this cruel and cowardly subjugation of a competitor, not in honest,\r\n open combat, but by taking advantage of a position to deny him food,\r\n shelter, and the very necessaries of life? For an answer, such as\r\n would bring indignant emotion to every heart not indurated by avarice\r\n of gold, and shame to every cheek not rendered incapable of blushing\r\n by hardened selfishness, we refer to the terrible facts, so calmly\r\n told with the severity of simple truth by Mr. Lloyd.\r\n\r\n Starved Rock and Spring Valley are not isolated instances. The malady\r\n is constitutional, not local. \"The whole head is sick and the whole\r\n heart faint,\" may be said of our modern system of business.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Nationalist_.\r\n\r\n In this age of strikes it is not always the workers who strike, as\r\n is indicated by the title of Mr. Lloyd's book. That brilliant and\r\n great-hearted journalist and publicist several months ago, in the\r\n shape of an open letter of several columns, printed in the Chicago\r\n _Herald_, told the story of the criminal and cold-blooded conspiracy\r\n of a group of enormously rich men against a body of honest and\r\n industrious workingmen. That letter he has made the basis of the\r\n present volume, which deserves a wide circulation among patriotic\r\n citizens of the United States. The strong and truthful words here\r\n uttered ought to ring throughout the land and arouse the people to a\r\n realizing sense of the greatest danger that has ever threatened our\r\n republic--the danger of its conversion into the worst of despotisms,\r\n that of rule by an irresponsible plutocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Burlington _Hawkeye_.\r\n\r\n Mr. Lloyd proves every charge he makes, the testimony he brings\r\n forward being so presented as to leave no question as to its absolute\r\n correctness. In all the dark record of tyranny, cruelty, and brutality\r\n made by the coal barons of this country there is not a blacker chapter\r\n than that which tells of their crimes against the miners of Spring\r\n Valley in the year 1889. This is not the verdict of the \"labor crank\"\r\n alone; the people of Chicago and the whole of northern Illinois, in\r\n the press and pulpit and on the platform, have denounced the outrage,\r\n and the cooler judgment of to-day, when the lock-out is about worn out\r\n and the majority of the old miners are scattered all over the country,\r\n is in accord with the denunciation made by Mr. Lloyd.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Rock Islander_, Rock Island, Ill.\r\n\r\n _A Strike of Millionaires against Miners, or the Story of Spring\r\n Valley._ The above is the title of a beautifully printed volume of\r\n 264 pages, by Henry D. Lloyd. Its prelude is the story of the starved\r\n Indians of Starved Rock, and it proceeds to parallel that by the\r\n starvation of labor by the millionaires. The story of Spring Valley\r\n is given in detail, with official proof of its truthfulness, and is\r\n graphically told by Mr. Lloyd. Its exposure of the oppressors of\r\n labor is terrific. It shows who they are; who has done this thing;\r\n how the town was boomed; how it was doomed; how the ghost of Starved\r\n Rock walks abroad; and how people are bought and enslaved in this\r\n boasted free country. It gives Governor Fifer a deserved slap for\r\n not going in person to the scene of starvation, and it roasts his\r\n military toady of the rich (Adjutant-General Vance) who was sent\r\n there by the governor to investigate, and whose report is proven to\r\n be a tissue of sneers at the poor, and falsehoods in regard to them\r\n and their situation. He quotes freely and approvingly from the report\r\n of Judge Gould and Mr. Wines, proving all that was claimed for the\r\n suffering there. He shows (page 66) that the Chicago, Milwaukee and\r\n St. Paul Railroad Company generously acknowledged the necessity for\r\n help by hiring a physician for its miners at Braceville, and sending\r\n supplies of necessaries for sick women and children to be given out by\r\n its agent there. He shows up the campaign of slander against Spring\r\n Valley, which was carried on through capitalistic newspapers and\r\n corporation tools; says the Spring Valley case is only a preliminary\r\n skirmish of capital against labor, and, after showing the first\r\n fruits, asks what the last will be. He closes with a chapter giving\r\n part of the moral. An appendix is added, showing what the millionaires\r\n said of themselves, and the replies by the miners and the press.\r\n Everybody should read this most remarkable and ably prepared story of\r\n the crime of capital upon labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Seed-Time_ (London), the organ of the New Fellowship.\r\n\r\n Perhaps the most striking of all the American object-lessons on the\r\n tendencies of capitalism has been given us by Mr. Henry D. Lloyd, of\r\n Chicago, who has recently published a book entitled, _A Strike of\r\n Millionaires against Miners, or the Story of Spring Valley_. A more\r\n complete exposure of the tyranny and cruelty of capitalism has never\r\n before been made. Its great importance for us, however, lies in the\r\n fact that all the tyranny and wrong he witnessed and describes are but\r\n the natural outcomes of the principles of commercialism when those\r\n principles are carried to their logical conclusion, and capitalism has\r\n unchecked sway. Such terrible scenes do not occur everywhere, simply\r\n because capitalism is held in check by other social forces, and has\r\n not everywhere attained that full and unfettered development which\r\n discloses the evils which in its more undeveloped stage lie concealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Twentieth Century_.\r\n\r\n It is a mind-agitating and heart-rending tale, and unless I am much\r\n mistaken the publication of it will create an epoch in economic\r\n thinking and social regeneration. What is the remedy for such crimes\r\n as Mr. Lloyd has exposed? The remedy will be found if open-minded\r\n persons will read such books as Mr. Lloyd's, and keep themselves\r\n informed as to what is being done to reduce a people to servitude.\r\n This single book ought to produce such a revulsion of feeling against\r\n the monstrous millionaires who perpetrated this awful crime that they\r\n would be looked upon by all decent people with abhorrence.\r\n\r\n If you will read Mr. Lloyd's book I think you will agree with me that\r\n if before long, as many persons believe, this county is to be deluged\r\n in the blood of revolution, the catastrophe will be brought on by\r\n condoning such crimes as that at Spring Valley; it will be brought on\r\n because you and I read such stories as this, and, knowing they are\r\n true, straightway forget all about them; it will be brought on because\r\n editors and preachers, and others who have the public ear, keep silent\r\n through negligence or fear of the rich who misrule the land. If people\r\n will not think, if they will not care, you may depend upon it that the\r\n price of their indifference will be slavery or war.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a letter to the _Twentieth Century_.\r\n\r\n Your article, and the extracts from Mr. Lloyd's book in your issue of\r\n June 12, portraying the outrageous injustice inflicted on the Spring\r\n Valley coal miners by the railway and coal-mining barons, was read\r\n before our club by Judge Frank T. Reid, of this city, a member of the\r\n club, at its regular weekly meeting, Monday, June 23. A resolution\r\n was unanimously passed and sent to the General Executive Board of the\r\n Nationalist clubs at Boston, requesting it to get up a memorial to\r\n the Government Bureau of Labor, petitioning that body to institute\r\n a special inquiry into the outrages; that this be done with a view\r\n of publishing these crimes to the whole country, under the proper\r\n authority, and also with the view of memorializing Congress for the\r\n government to work either all or part of the coal-mining industry on\r\n the same principle that it works the postal service, the government\r\n printing-office at Washington, and other industries, as the present\r\n method of running the coal mines by corporations has resulted, and\r\n will continue to result, in rioting and bloodshed, and imperils\r\n the very existence of society. We would suggest that copies of the\r\n memorial be sent to all the Nationalist clubs for signatures, and also\r\n to the Federated trades, Knights of Labor, and other organized bodies\r\n and to individuals. Might we also suggest that you kindly communicate\r\n with the Executive Board of Boston, and with our worthy and earnest\r\n brothers, Messrs. Bellamy, Bliss, and others?\r\n\r\n Yours fraternally,\r\n J.L. Johnson,\r\n _Secretary Nationalist Club_.\r\n\r\n Tacoma, Wash. #/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Open Court_.\r\n\r\n The story of Spring Valley will make every American citizen of healthy\r\n morals uncomfortable and ashamed.... A story which must be read, and\r\n the lesson of it heeded, or worse things come.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis _Republic_.\r\n\r\n A stirring account of the great mining strike, lock-out, and\r\n consequent misery at Spring Valley, Illinois, in 1888-89, the main\r\n features of which are still familiar to the reading public. Mr. Lloyd\r\n lays the blame where it belongs, and shows how the whole transaction\r\n worked to the profit of the plutocrats at the expense of their\r\n dupes--the enterprising thousands who believed in the promises made\r\n in booming the location. The booming of the town was followed by the\r\n dooming, and, as the _Republic_ and many other papers showed at the\r\n time, the action of the mine operators all through was \"a cruel abuse\r\n of intellectual strength to use it to force weakness and ignorance\r\n into such a condition of helplessness.\" The author gives facts and\r\n figures, and his account of the matter is borne out by the news\r\n columns of the times. It is a sad story, and its truthfulness is a\r\n shameful comment upon the tendencies of our day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburg _Labor Tribune_.\r\n\r\n _A Strike of Millionaires against Miners, or the Story of Spring\r\n Valley_, is a handsome edition of the important matter written by\r\n Henry D. Lloyd when the notable strike was on at the mines located at\r\n Spring Valley, Illinois. Our miner readers especially will read with\r\n satisfaction the vim and ability with which Mr. Lloyd handles the\r\n literary end of that eventful period, and will be pleased to know that\r\n he has issued the matter in consecutive form.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Democrat_ (London).\r\n\r\n Bad as the social and industrial condition of Great Britain is, that\r\n of the United States threatens to become as bad or even worse unless\r\n the power of landlordism there is subjected to popular control. A\r\n striking instance of the rapid growth of monopoly and its ruinous\r\n effect on industry, as well as its atrocious tyranny over labor, is\r\n recorded in a striking little book by Mr. Henry D. Lloyd, of Chicago,\r\n called _A Strike of Millionaires against Miners_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rights of Labor_ (Chicago).\r\n\r\n This narrative of the rapacity and greed of our coal barons we most\r\n earnestly commend to all our readers as a plain, clear statement of\r\n facts, admirably put; it deserves the widest circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York _Herald_.\r\n\r\n This is one of the saddest, most enraging stories ever put on paper;\r\n of course the corporations protested, as corporations always do in\r\n such cases, that they were not to blame, but the awful facts cannot be\r\n denied or explained away. The _Herald_ expressed its mind editorially\r\n at the time. Now that the whole case is presented, the _Herald's_\r\n readers can see how easily a scheming gang of heartless scoundrels\r\n can quickly reduce thousands of families to a condition worse than\r\n old-fashioned African slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTacoma (Washington) _Globe_.\r\n\r\n Among the many books recently published on the labor question and the\r\n relations between the rich and the poor, none has excited a deeper\r\n interest than _A Strike of Millionaires against Miners_. Before the\r\n atrocities perpetrated in Spring Valley by the coal mining company,\r\n composed of some of the wealthiest men in the United States, the\r\n wrongs inflicted on the peasants in Ireland fade into insignificance.\r\n This book should have a wide reading, that all may know whither the\r\n nation is drifting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoston _Herald_.\r\n\r\n The story of the labor disturbances at Spring Valley, Illinois,\r\n caused by a shut-down of the mines in 1888, is told by H.D. Lloyd in\r\n a thrilling presentation. In perusing the whole history, from the\r\n first alluring advertisements of the mining companies to the editorial\r\n comments in Chicago papers after the lock-out took place, a dweller in\r\n happier laboring regions will hardly believe that so much injustice\r\n could have been done in free America.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Worker_ (Brisbane, Queensland).\r\n\r\n A simple but complete account of a terrible injustice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Christian Union_.\r\n\r\n Six or eight years ago there appeared in the _North American Review_\r\n an article entitled \"The Lords of Industry,\" by Henry D. Lloyd, which\r\n set forth with such power the nature and extent of the combinations to\r\n diminish production and increase prices that its author may be said\r\n to have initiated the anti-trust agitation of the last few years.\r\n Since that time he has gone on in the work thus begun, putting heart\r\n and soul into it. The _Strike of Millionaires against Miners_ carries\r\n perhaps less weight with our intellects than Mr. Lloyd's earlier work,\r\n but it appeals so strongly to our hearts that we are carried with him\r\n through the volume, and share with him his indignation over the wrongs\r\n he describes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n CONCORD, New Hampshire, _October 22, 1892_.\r\n\r\n DEAR MR. LLOYD,--I am reading the _Study_ you so kindly sent me. I\r\n have read most of it, including the \"Word to Coal Miners,\" and what a\r\n \"study!\" What a lesson! What an apocalypse! Through it, \"the voice of\r\n our brothers' blood cries to us from the ground,\" literally, and in\r\n tones scarcely ever heard before by human or heavenly ear!\r\n\r\n Would that you could peal out all the seven thunders of Patmos. I wish\r\n your work might outsell in number _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, and _Robert\r\n Elsmere_ combined, till its note filled the earth as the waters the\r\n seas. Print the whole of this hasty testimony over my name, if it will\r\n be of service to the working man and woman.\r\n\r\n Faithfully and fraternally yours, for every good thought, word, and\r\n work,\r\n\r\n PARKER PILLSBURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BOOK FOR THE TIMES\r\n\r\nTHE RAILWAYS AND THE REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\nBy JAMES F. HUDSON. 8vo, Cloth, $2 00.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author studies carefully the evils of the system, inquires into the\r\npower of legislation to cure them, and describes the remedies which\r\nwill preserve the usefulness of the railways, and at the same time\r\nprotect legitimate investors.--_N.Y. Evening Post._\r\n\r\nIt is seldom the public is given a work at once so timely, so brave,\r\nand so able.... Mr. Hudson writes with the most exhaustive knowledge\r\nof his subject, and with an unusual ability in setting forth his ideas\r\nso that they are easily and clearly understood. There is hardly a more\r\nvigorous chapter in modern literature than that in which he discusses\r\nthe rise and growth of the Standard Company.... The book is everywhere\r\nmarked by unusual ability, accuracy, and fearlessness, which make it\r\none of the most important contributions of the day to a subject which\r\nof necessity engages more and more attention every day. The political\r\nprinciples of the writer are thoroughly sound and practical.--_Boston\r\nCourier._\r\n\r\nThe subject is of such vital importance that no man or woman in the\r\ncountry should be ignorant about it.--_N.Y.
