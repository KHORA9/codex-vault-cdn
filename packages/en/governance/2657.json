There\r\nwas no opening to nominate him for Superintendent of Public Instruction,\r\nbut through him Egypt made a most valuable contribution to the convention.\r\nI think it may be fairly said that he came off the lion of the day--or\r\nrather of the night. Can you not elect him to the Legislature? It seems to\r\nme he would be hard to beat. What objection could be made to him? What is\r\nyour Senator Martin saying and doing? What is Webb about?\r\n\r\nPlease write me. Yours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 24, 1858\r\n\r\nH. C. WHITNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your letter enclosing the attack of the Times upon me was\r\nreceived this morning. Give yourself no concern about my voting against\r\nthe supplies. Unless you are without faith that a lie can be successfully\r\ncontradicted, there is not a word of truth in the charge, and I am just\r\nconsidering a little as to the best shape to put a contradiction in. Show\r\nthis to whomever you please, but do not publish it in the paper.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. W. SOMERS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 25, 1858.\r\n\r\nJAMES W. SOMERS, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 22nd, inclosing a draft of two hundred dollars,\r\nwas duly received. I have paid it on the judgment, and herewith you\r\nhave the receipt. I do not wish to say anything as to who shall be the\r\nRepublican candidate for the Legislature in your district, further than\r\nthat I have full confidence in Dr. Hull. Have you ever got in the way of\r\nconsulting with McKinley in political matters? He is true as steel, and\r\nhis judgment is very good. The last I heard from him, he rather thought\r\nWeldon, of De Witt, was our best timber for representative, all things\r\nconsidered. But you there must settle it among yourselves. It may well\r\npuzzle older heads than yours to understand how, as the Dred Scott\r\ndecision holds, Congress can authorize a Territorial Legislature to do\r\neverything else, and cannot authorize them to prohibit slavery. That is\r\none of the things the court can decide, but can never give an intelligible\r\nreason for.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 28, 1858.\r\n\r\nA. CAMPBELL, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--In 1856 you gave me authority to draw on you for any sum not\r\nexceeding five hundred dollars. I see clearly that such a privilege would\r\nbe more available now than it was then. I am aware that times are tighter\r\nnow than they were then. Please write me at all events, and whether you\r\ncan now do anything or not I shall continue grateful for the past.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, July 16, 1858.\r\n\r\nHON. JOSEPH GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I write this to say that from the specimens of Douglas\r\nDemocracy we occasionally see here from Madison, we learn that they are\r\nmaking very confident calculation of beating you and your friends for the\r\nlower house, in that county. They offer to bet upon it. Billings and Job,\r\nrespectively, have been up here, and were each as I learn, talking largely\r\nabout it. If they do so, it can only be done by carrying the Fillmore men\r\nof 1856 very differently from what they seem to [be] going in the other\r\nparty. Below is the vote of 1856, in your district:\r\n\r\nCounties.\r\n\r\n     Counties.  Buchanan.   Fremont.   Fillmore.\r\n   Bond............ 607      153      659\r\n   Madison......... 1451     1111     1658\r\n   Montgomery...... 992      162      686\r\n                     ----     ----     ----\r\n                     3050     1426     3003\r\n\r\nBy this you will see, if you go through the calculation, that if they get\r\none quarter of the Fillmore votes, and you three quarters, they will beat\r\nyou 125 votes. If they get one fifth, and you four fifths, you beat them\r\n179. In Madison, alone, if our friends get 1000 of the Fillmore votes, and\r\ntheir opponents the remainder, 658, we win by just two votes.\r\n\r\nThis shows the whole field, on the basis of the election of 1856.\r\n\r\nWhether, since then, any Buchanan, or Fremonters, have shifted ground, and\r\nhow the majority of new votes will go, you can judge better than I.\r\n\r\nOf course you, on the ground, can better determine your line of tactics\r\nthan any one off the ground; but it behooves you to be wide awake and\r\nactively working.\r\n\r\nDon't neglect it; and write me at your first leisure. Yours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN MATHERS, JACKSONVILLE, ILL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, JULY 20, 1858.\r\n\r\nJNO. MATHERS, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your kind and interesting letter of the 19th was duly\r\nreceived. Your suggestions as to placing one's self on the offensive\r\nrather than the defensive are certainly correct. That is a point which I\r\nshall not disregard. I spoke here on Saturday night. The speech, not very\r\nwell reported, appears in the State journal of this morning. You doubtless\r\nwill see it; and I hope that you will perceive in it that I am already\r\nimproving. I would mail you a copy now, but have not one [at] hand. I\r\nthank you for your letter and shall be pleased to hear from you again.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, JULY 25, 1858.\r\n\r\nHON. J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your doleful letter of the 8th was received on my return\r\nfrom Chicago last night. I do hope you are worse scared than hurt, though\r\nyou ought to know best. We must not lose the district. We must make a job\r\nof it, and save it. Lay hold of the proper agencies, and secure all the\r\nAmericans you can, at once. I do hope, on closer inspection, you will find\r\nthey are not half gone. Make a little test. Run down one of the poll-books\r\nof the Edwardsville precinct, and take the first hundred known American\r\nnames. Then quietly ascertain how many of them are actually going for\r\nDouglas. I think you will find less than fifty. But even if you find\r\nfifty, make sure of the other fifty, that is, make sure of all you can, at\r\nall events. We will set other agencies to work which shall compensate for\r\nthe loss of a good many Americans. Don't fail to check the stampede at\r\nonce. Trumbull, I think, will be with you before long.\r\n\r\nThere is much he cannot do, and some he can. I have reason to hope there\r\nwill be other help of an appropriate kind. Write me again.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO B. C. COOK.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. 2, 1858.\r\n\r\nHon. B. C. COOK.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have a letter from a very true and intelligent man\r\ninsisting that there is a plan on foot in La Salle and Bureau to run\r\nDouglas Republicans for Congress and for the Legislature in those\r\ncounties, if they can only get the encouragement of our folks nominating\r\npretty extreme abolitionists.\r\n\r\nIt is thought they will do nothing if our folks nominate men who are not\r\nvery obnoxious to the charge of abolitionism. Please have your eye upon\r\nthis. Signs are looking pretty fair.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HON. J. M. PALMER.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. 5, 1858.\r\n\r\nHON. J. M. PALMER.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Since we parted last evening no new thought has occurred to\r\n[me] on the subject of which we talked most yesterday.\r\n\r\nI have concluded, however, to speak at your town on Tuesday, August 31st,\r\nand have promised to have it so appear in the papers of to-morrow. Judge\r\nTrumbull has not yet reached here.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALEXANDER SYMPSON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. 11, 1858.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER SYMPSON, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 6th received. If life and health continue I shall\r\npretty likely be at Augusta on the 25th.\r\n\r\nThings look reasonably well. Will tell you more fully when I see you.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. O. CUNNINGHAM.\r\n\r\nOTTAWA, August 22, 1858.\r\n\r\nJ. O. CUNNINGHAM, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 18th, signed as secretary of the Republican\r\nclub, is received. In the matter of making speeches I am a good deal\r\npressed by invitations from almost all quarters, and while I hope to be\r\nat Urbana some time during the canvass, I cannot yet say when. Can you not\r\nsee me at Monticello on the 6th of September?\r\n\r\nDouglas and I, for the first time this canvass, crossed swords here\r\nyesterday; the fire flew some, and I am glad to know I am yet alive. There\r\nwas a vast concourse of people--more than could get near enough to hear.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON SLAVERY IN A DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nAugust??, 1858\r\n\r\nAs I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses\r\nmy idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the\r\ndifference, is no democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO B. C. COOK.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, August 2, 1858\r\n\r\nHON. B. C. COOK.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have a letter from a very true friend, and intelligent\r\nman, writing that there is a plan on foot in La Salle and Bureau, to run\r\nDouglas Republican for Congress and for the Legislature in those counties,\r\nif they can only get the encouragement of our folks nominating pretty\r\nextreme abolitionists. It is thought they will do nothing if our folks\r\nnominate men who are not very [undecipherable word looks like \"obnoxious\"]\r\nto the charge of abolitionism. Please have your eye upon this. Signs are\r\nlooking pretty fair.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. WILLIAM FITHIAN, DANVILLE, ILL.\r\n\r\nBLOOMINGTON, Sept. 3, 1858\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR:--Yours of the 1st was received this morning, as also one from\r\nMr. Harmon, and one from Hiram Beckwith on the same subject. You will see\r\nby the Journal that I have been appointed to speak at Danville on the 22d\r\nof Sept.,--the day after Douglas speaks there. My recent experience\r\nshows that speaking at the same place the next day after D. is the very\r\nthing,--it is, in fact, a concluding speech on him. Please show this\r\nto Messrs. Harmon and Beckwith; and tell them they must excuse me from\r\nwriting separate letters to them.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nP. S.--Give full notice to all surrounding country. A.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT PARIS, ILL.,\r\n\r\nSEPT. 8, 1858.\r\n\r\nLet us inquire what Judge Douglas really invented when he introduced the\r\nNebraska Bill? He called it Popular Sovereignty. What does that mean?\r\nIt means the sovereignty of the people over their own affairs--in other\r\nwords, the right of the people to govern themselves. Did Judge Douglas\r\ninvent this? Not quite. The idea of popular sovereignty was floating about\r\nseveral ages before the author of the Nebraska Bill was born--indeed,\r\nbefore Columbus set foot on this continent. In the year 1776 it took form\r\nin the noble words which you are all familiar with: \"We hold these truths\r\nto be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\" etc. Was not this the\r\norigin of popular sovereignty as applied to the American people? Here we\r\nare told that governments are instituted among men deriving their\r\njust powers from the consent of the governed. If that is not popular\r\nsovereignty, then I have no conception of the meaning of words. If Judge\r\nDouglas did not invent this kind of popular sovereignty, let us pursue\r\nthe inquiry and find out what kind he did invent. Was it the right of\r\nemigrants to Kansas and Nebraska to govern themselves, and a lot of\r\n\"niggers,\" too, if they wanted them? Clearly this was no invention of his\r\nbecause General Cass put forth the same doctrine in 1848 in his so called\r\nNicholson letter, six years before Douglas thought of such a thing. Then\r\nwhat was it that the \"Little Giant\" invented? It never occurred to General\r\nCass to call his discovery by the odd name of popular sovereignty. He had\r\nnot the face to say that the right of the people to govern \"niggers\" was\r\nthe right of the people to govern themselves. His notions of the fitness\r\nof things were not moulded to the brazenness of calling the right to put\r\na hundred \"niggers\" through under the lash in Nebraska a \"sacred\" right of\r\nself-government. And here I submit to you was Judge Douglas's discovery,\r\nand the whole of it: He discovered that the right to breed and flog\r\nnegroes in Nebraska was popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT CLINTON, ILLINOIS,\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 8, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe questions are sometimes asked \"What is all this fuss that is being\r\nmade about negroes? What does it amount to? And where will it end?\" These\r\nquestions imply that those who ask them consider the slavery question a\r\nvery insignificant matter they think that it amounts to little or nothing\r\nand that those who agitate it are extremely foolish. Now it must be\r\nadmitted that if the great question which has caused so much trouble is\r\ninsignificant, we are very foolish to have anything to do with it--if it\r\nis of no importance we had better throw it aside and busy ourselves\r\nwith something else. But let us inquire a little into this insignificant\r\nmatter, as it is called by some, and see if it is not important enough to\r\ndemand the close attention of every well-wisher of the Union. In one of\r\nDouglas's recent speeches, I find a reference to one which was made by\r\nme in Springfield some time ago. The judge makes one quotation from that\r\nspeech that requires some little notice from me at this time. I regret\r\nthat I have not my Springfield speech before me, but the judge has quoted\r\none particular part of it so often that I think I can recollect it. It\r\nruns I think as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with\r\nthe avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery\r\nagitation. Under the operation of that policy that agitation has not only\r\nnot ceased but has constantly augmented. In my opinion it will not cease\r\nuntil a crisis shall have been reached and passed.\r\n\r\n\"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government\r\ncannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the\r\nUnion to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall, but I do expect\r\nit will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the\r\nother. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of\r\nit and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it\r\nis in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it\r\nforward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well\r\nas new, North as well as South.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas makes use of the above quotation, and finds a great deal of\r\nfault with it. He deals unfairly with me, and tries to make the people of\r\nthis State believe that I advocated dangerous doctrines in my Springfield\r\nspeech. Let us see if that portion of my Springfield speech of which Judge\r\nDouglas complains so bitterly, is as objectionable to others as it is\r\nto him. We are, certainly, far into the fifth year since a policy was\r\ninitiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end\r\nto slavery agitation. On the fourth day of January, 1854, Judge Douglas\r\nintroduced the Kansas-Nebraska bill. He initiated a new policy, and that\r\npolicy, so he says, was to put an end to the agitation of the slavery\r\nquestion. Whether that was his object or not I will not stop to discuss,\r\nbut at all events some kind of a policy was initiated; and what has been\r\nthe result? Instead of the quiet and good feeling which were promised us\r\nby the self-styled author of Popular Sovereignty, we have had nothing but\r\nill-feeling and agitation. According to Judge Douglas, the passage of the\r\nNebraska bill would tranquilize the whole country--there would be no more\r\nslavery agitation in or out of Congress, and the vexed question would be\r\nleft entirely to the people of the Territories. Such was the opinion\r\nof Judge Douglas, and such were the opinions of the leading men of the\r\nDemocratic Party. Even as late as the spring of 1856 Mr. Buchanan said, a\r\nshort time subsequent to his nomination by the Cincinnati convention, that\r\nthe territory of Kansas would be tranquil in less than six weeks. Perhaps\r\nhe thought so, but Kansas has not been and is not tranquil, and it may be\r\na long time before she may be so.\r\n\r\nWe all know how fierce the agitation was in Congress last winter, and\r\nwhat a narrow escape Kansas had from being admitted into the Union with a\r\nconstitution that was detested by ninety-nine hundredths of her citizens.\r\nDid the angry debates which took place at Washington during the last\r\nseason of Congress lead you to suppose that the slavery agitation was\r\nsettled?\r\n\r\nAn election was held in Kansas in the month of August, and the\r\nconstitution which was submitted to the people was voted down by a large\r\nmajority. So Kansas is still out of the Union, and there is a probability\r\nthat she will remain out for some time. But Judge Douglas says the slavery\r\nquestion is settled. He says the bill he introduced into the Senate of\r\nthe United States on the 4th day of January, 1854, settled the slavery\r\nquestion forever! Perhaps he can tell us how that bill settled the slavery\r\nquestion, for if he is able to settle a question of such great magnitude\r\nhe ought to be able to explain the manner in which he does it. He knows\r\nand you know that the question is not settled, and that his ill-timed\r\nexperiment to settle it has made it worse than it ever was before.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me say a few words in regard to Douglas's great hobby of negro\r\nequality. He thinks--he says at least--that the Republican party is in\r\nfavor of allowing whites and blacks to intermarry, and that a man can't be\r\na good Republican unless he is willing to elevate black men to office\r\nand to associate with them on terms of perfect equality. He knows that\r\nwe advocate no such doctrines as these, but he cares not how much he\r\nmisrepresents us if he can gain a few votes by so doing. To show you what\r\nmy opinion of negro equality was in times past, and to prove to you that\r\nI stand on that question where I always stood, I will read you a few\r\nextracts from a speech that was made by me in Peoria in 1854. It was made\r\nin reply to one of Judge Douglas's speeches.\r\n\r\n(Mr. Lincoln then read a number of extracts which had the ring of the true\r\nmetal. We have rarely heard anything with which we have been more pleased.\r\nAnd the audience after hearing the extracts read, and comparing their\r\nconservative sentiments with those now advocated by Mr. Lincoln, testified\r\ntheir approval by loud applause. How any reasonable man can hear one\r\nof Mr. Lincoln's speeches without being converted to Republicanism is\r\nsomething that we can't account for. Ed.)\r\n\r\nSlavery, continued Mr. Lincoln, is not a matter of little importance,\r\nit overshadows every other question in which we are interested. It has\r\ndivided the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, and has sown discord in\r\nthe American Tract Society. The churches have split and the society will\r\nfollow their example before long. So it will be seen that slavery is\r\nagitated in the religious as well as in the political world. Judge Douglas\r\nis very much afraid in the triumph that the Republican party will lead\r\nto a general mixture of the white and black races. Perhaps I am wrong\r\nin saying that he is afraid, so I will correct myself by saying that\r\nhe pretends to fear that the success of our party will result in the\r\namalgamation of the blacks and whites. I think I can show plainly, from\r\ndocuments now before me, that Judge Douglas's fears are groundless. The\r\ncensus of 1800 tells us that in that year there were over four hundred\r\nthousand mulattoes in the United States. Now let us take what is called\r\nan Abolition State--the Republican, slavery-hating State of New\r\nHampshire--and see how many mulattoes we can find within her borders.\r\nThe number amounts to just one hundred and eighty-four. In the Old\r\nDominion--in the Democratic and aristocratic State of Virginia--there were\r\na few more mulattoes than the Census-takers found in New Hampshire. How\r\nmany do you suppose there were? Seventy-nine thousand, seven hundred and\r\nseventy-five--twenty-three thousand more than there were in all the\r\nfree States! In the slave States there were in 1800, three hundred and\r\nforty-eight thousand mulattoes all of home production; and in the free\r\nStates there were less than sixty thousand mulattoes--and a large number\r\nof them were imported from the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT EDWARDSVILLE, ILL.,\r\n\r\nSEPT. 13, 1858.\r\n\r\nI have been requested to give a concise statement of the difference, as\r\nI understand it, between the Democratic and Republican parties, on the\r\nleading issues of the campaign. This question has been put to me by a\r\ngentleman whom I do not know. I do not even know whether he is a friend of\r\nmine or a supporter of Judge Douglas in this contest, nor does that make\r\nany difference. His question is a proper one. Lest I should forget it, I\r\nwill give you my answer before proceeding with the line of argument I have\r\nmarked out for this discussion.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the Republican and the Democratic parties on the\r\nleading issues of this contest, as I understand it, is that the former\r\nconsider slavery a moral, social and political wrong, while the latter\r\ndo not consider it either a moral, a social or a political wrong; and the\r\naction of each, as respects the growth of the country and the expansion of\r\nour population, is squared to meet these views. I will not affirm that the\r\nDemocratic party consider slavery morally, socially and politically right,\r\nthough their tendency to that view has, in my opinion, been constant and\r\nunmistakable for the past five years. I prefer to take, as the accepted\r\nmaxim of the party, the idea put forth by Judge Douglas, that he \"don't\r\ncare whether slavery is voted down or voted up.\" I am quite willing to\r\nbelieve that many Democrats would prefer that slavery should be always\r\nvoted down, and I know that some prefer that it be always voted up; but\r\nI have a right to insist that their action, especially if it be their\r\nconstant action, shall determine their ideas and preferences on this\r\nsubject. Every measure of the Democratic party of late years, bearing\r\ndirectly or indirectly on the slavery question, has corresponded with this\r\nnotion of utter indifference whether slavery or freedom shall outrun in\r\nthe race of empire across to the Pacific--every measure, I say, up to the\r\nDred Scott decision, where, it seems to me, the idea is boldly suggested\r\nthat slavery is better than freedom. The Republican party, on the\r\ncontrary, hold that this government was instituted to secure the blessings\r\nof freedom, and that slavery is an unqualified evil to the negro, to the\r\nwhite man, to the soil, and to the State. Regarding it as an evil, they\r\nwill not molest it in the States where it exists, they will not overlook\r\nthe constitutional guards which our fathers placed around it; they will\r\ndo nothing that can give proper offence to those who hold slaves by legal\r\nsanction; but they will use every constitutional method to prevent the\r\nevil from becoming larger and involving more negroes, more white men,\r\nmore soil, and more States in its deplorable consequences. They will, if\r\npossible, place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it\r\nis in course of ultimate peaceable extinction in God's own good time. And\r\nto this end they will, if possible, restore the government to the policy\r\nof the fathers, the policy of preserving the new Territories from the\r\nbaneful influence of human bondage, as the Northwestern Territories were\r\nsought to be preserved by the Ordinance of 1787, and the Compromise Act\r\nof 1820. They will oppose, in all its length and breadth, the modern\r\nDemocratic idea, that slavery is as good as freedom, and ought to have\r\nroom for expansion all over the continent, if people can be found to carry\r\nit. All, or nearly all, of Judge Douglas's arguments are logical, if you\r\nadmit that slavery is as good and as right as freedom, and not one of them\r\nis worth a rush if you deny it. This is the difference, as I understand\r\nit, between the Republican and Democratic parties.\r\n\r\nMy friends, I have endeavored to show you the logical consequences of the\r\nDred Scott decision, which holds that the people of a Territory cannot\r\nprevent the establishment of slavery in their midst. I have stated what\r\ncannot be gainsaid, that the grounds upon which this decision is made are\r\nequally applicable to the free States as to the free Territories, and\r\nthat the peculiar reasons put forth by Judge Douglas for indorsing this\r\ndecision commit him, in advance, to the next decision and to all other\r\ndecisions corning from the same source. And when, by all these means, you\r\nhave succeeded in dehumanizing the negro; when you have put him down and\r\nmade it impossible for him to be but as the beasts of the field; when you\r\nhave extinguished his soul in this world and placed him where the ray of\r\nhope is blown out as in the darkness of the damned, are you quite\r\nsure that the demon you have roused will not turn and rend you? What\r\nconstitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence? It is not\r\nour frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, our army and our navy.\r\nThese are not our reliance against tyranny All of those may be turned\r\nagainst us without making us weaker for the struggle. Our reliance is in\r\nthe love of liberty which God has planted in us. Our defense is in the\r\nspirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands\r\neverywhere. Destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of\r\ndespotism at your own doors. Familiarize yourselves with the chains of\r\nbondage and you prepare your own limbs to wear them. Accustomed to trample\r\non the rights of others, you have lost the genius of your own independence\r\nand become the fit subjects of the first cunning tyrant who rises among\r\nyou. And let me tell you, that all these things are prepared for you by\r\nthe teachings of history, if the elections shall promise that the next\r\nDred Scott decision and all future decisions will be quietly acquiesced in\r\nby the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERSE TO \"LINNIE\"\r\n\r\nSeptember 30,? 1858.\r\n\r\nTO \"LINNIE\":\r\n\r\n     A sweet plaintive song did I hear\r\n     And I fancied that she was the singer.\r\n     May emotions as pure as that song set astir\r\n     Be the wont that the future shall bring her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGROES ARE MEN\r\n\r\nTO J. U. BROWN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, OCT 18, 1858\r\n\r\nHON. J. U. BROWN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I do not perceive how I can express myself more plainly\r\nthan I have in the fore-going extracts. In four of them I have expressly\r\ndisclaimed all intention to bring about social and political equality\r\nbetween the white and black races and in all the rest I have done the same\r\nthing by clear implication.\r\n\r\nI have made it equally plain that I think the negro is included in the\r\nword \"men\" used in the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nI believe the declaration that \"all men are created equal\" is the great\r\nfundamental principle upon which our free institutions rest; that\r\nnegro slavery is violative of that principle; but that, by our frame of\r\ngovernment, that principle has not been made one of legal obligation; that\r\nby our frame of government, States which have slavery are to retain it, or\r\nsurrender it at their own pleasure; and that all others--individuals, free\r\nStates and national Government--are constitutionally bound to leave them\r\nalone about it.\r\n\r\nI believe our Government was thus framed because of the necessity\r\nspringing from the actual presence of slavery, when it was framed.\r\n\r\nThat such necessity does not exist in the Territories when slavery is not\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn his Mendenhall speech Mr. Clay says: \"Now as an abstract principle\r\nthere is no doubt of the truth of that declaration (all men created\r\nequal), and it is desirable, in the original construction of society, to\r\nkeep it in view as a great fundamental principle.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in the same speech Mr. Clay says: \"If a state of nature existed\r\nand we were about to lay the foundations of society, no man would be more\r\nstrongly opposed than I should to incorporate the institution of slavery\r\namong its elements.\"\r\n\r\nExactly so. In our new free Territories, a state of nature does exist.\r\nIn them Congress lays the foundations of society; and in laying those\r\nfoundations, I say, with Mr. Clay, it is desirable that the declaration\r\nof the equality of all men shall be kept in view as a great fundamental\r\nprinciple, and that Congress, which lays the foundations of society,\r\nshould, like Mr. Clay, be strongly opposed to the incorporation of slavery\r\nand its elements.\r\n\r\nBut it does not follow that social and political equality between whites\r\nand blacks must be incorporated because slavery must not. The declaration\r\ndoes not so require.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

SYMPSON, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Since parting with you this morning I heard some things which\r\nmake me believe that Edmunds and Morrill will spend this week among the\r\nNational Democrats, trying to induce them to content themselves by voting\r\nfor Jake Davis, and then to vote for the Douglas candidates for senator\r\nand representative. Have this headed off, if you can. Call Wagley's\r\nattention to it and have him and the National Democrat for Rep. to\r\ncounteract it as far as they can.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

JUDD\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 15th is just received. I wrote you the same day.\r\nAs to the pecuniary matter, I am willing to pay according to my ability;\r\nbut I am the poorest hand living to get others to pay. I have been on\r\nexpenses so long without earning anything that I am absolutely without\r\nmoney now for even household purposes. Still, if you can put in two\r\nhundred and fifty dollars for me toward discharging the debt of the\r\ncommittee, I will allow it when you and I settle the private matter\r\nbetween us. This, with what I have already paid, and with an outstanding\r\nnote of mine, will exceed my subscription of five hundred dollars. This,\r\ntoo, is exclusive of my ordinary expenses during the campaign, all of\r\nwhich, being added to my loss of time and business, bears pretty heavily\r\nupon one no better off in [this] world's goods than I; but as I had\r\nthe post of honor, it is not for me to be over nice. You are feeling\r\nbadly,--\"And this too shall pass away,\" never fear.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT MUST GO ON\r\n\r\nTO H.

The cause of civil liberty must not be surrendered at the end of one\r\nor even one hundred defeats. Douglas had the ingenuity to be supported in\r\nthe late contest both as the best means to break down and to uphold the\r\nslave interest. No ingenuity can keep these antagonistic elements in\r\nharmony long. Another explosion will soon come.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

RAY\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I wish to preserve a set of the late debates (if they may be\r\ncalled so), between Douglas and myself. To enable me to do so, please get\r\ntwo copies of each number of your paper containing the whole, and send\r\nthem to me by express; and I will pay you for the papers and for\r\nyour trouble. I wish the two sets in order to lay one away in the\r\n[undecipherable word] and to put the other in a scrapbook. Remember, if\r\npart of any debate is on both sides of the sheet it will take two sets to\r\nmake one scrap-book.\r\n\r\nI believe, according to a letter of yours to Hatch, you are \"feeling like\r\nh-ll yet.\" Quit that--you will soon feel better. Another \"blow up\" is\r\ncoming; and we shall have fun again. Douglas managed to be supported\r\nboth as the best instrument to down and to uphold the slave power; but no\r\ningenuity can long keep the antagonism in harmony.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

WHITNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Being desirous of preserving in some permanent form the late\r\njoint discussion between Douglas and myself, ten days ago I wrote to Dr.\r\nRay, requesting him to forward to me by express two sets of the numbers of\r\nthe Tribune which contain the reports of those discussions. Up to date I\r\nhave no word from him on the subject. Will you, if in your power, procure\r\nthem and forward them to me by express? If you will, I will pay all\r\ncharges, and be greatly obliged, to boot. Hoping to visit you before long,\r\nI remain\r\n\r\nAs ever your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. D. SHARPE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. 8, 1858.\r\n\r\nH. D. SHARPE, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your very kind letter of Nov. 9th was duly received. I do\r\nnot know that you expected or desired an answer; but glancing over the\r\ncontents of yours again, I am prompted to say that, while I desired the\r\nresult of the late canvass to have been different, I still regard it as\r\nan exceeding small matter. I think we have fairly entered upon a durable\r\nstruggle as to whether this nation is to ultimately become all slave or\r\nall free, and though I fall early in the contest, it is nothing if I shall\r\nhave contributed, in the least degree, to the final rightful result.\r\n\r\nRespectfully yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. SYMPSON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec.12, 1858.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER SYMPSON, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I expect the result of the election went hard with you. So\r\nit did with me, too, perhaps not quite so hard as you may have supposed.\r\nI have an abiding faith that we shall beat them in the long run. Step by\r\nstep the objects of the leaders will become too plain for the people to\r\nstand them. I write merely to let you know that I am neither dead nor\r\ndying. Please give my respects to your good family, and all inquiring\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON BANKRUPTCY\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES OF AN ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nDecember [?], 1858.\r\n\r\nLegislation and adjudication must follow and conform to the progress of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe progress of society now begins to produce cases of the transfer for\r\ndebts of the entire property of railroad corporations; and to enable\r\ntransferees to use and enjoy the transferred property, legislation and\r\nadjudication begin to be necessary.\r\n\r\nShall this class of legislation just now beginning with us be general or\r\nspecial?\r\n\r\n\r\nSection Ten of our Constitution requires that it should be general,\r\n\r\nif possible. (Read the section.)\r\n\r\nSpecial legislation always trenches upon the judicial department; and in\r\nso far violates Section Two of the Constitution. (Read it.)\r\n\r\nJust reasoning--policy--is in favor of general legislation--else the\r\nLegislature will be loaded down with the investigation of smaller\r\ncases--a work which the courts ought to perform, and can perform much more\r\nperfectly. How can the Legislature rightly decide the facts between P. &\r\nB. and S.C.\r\n\r\nIt is said that under a general law, whenever a R. R. Co. gets tired\r\nof its debts, it may transfer fraudulently to get rid of them. So they\r\nmay--so may individuals; and which--the Legislature or the courts--is best\r\nsuited to try the question of fraud in either case?\r\n\r\nIt is said, if a purchaser have acquired legal rights, let him not be\r\nrobbed of them, but if he needs legislation let him submit to just terms\r\nto obtain it.\r\n\r\nLet him, say we, have general law in advance (guarded in every possible\r\nway against fraud), so that, when he acquires a legal right, he will have\r\nno occasion to wait for additional legislation; and if he has practiced\r\nfraud let the courts so decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LEGAL OPINION BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nThe 11th Section of the Act of Congress, approved Feb. 11, 1805,\r\nprescribing rules for the subdivision of sections of land within the\r\nUnited States system of surveys, standing unrepealed, in my opinion,\r\nis binding on the respective purchasers of different parts of the same\r\nsection, and furnishes the true rule for surveyors in establishing\r\nlines between them. That law, being in force at the time each became a\r\npurchaser, becomes a condition of the purchase.\r\n\r\nAnd, by that law, I think the true rule for dividing into quarters any\r\ninterior section or sections, which is not fractional, is to run straight\r\nlines through the section from the opposite quarter section corners,\r\nfixing the point where such straight lines cross, or intersect each other,\r\nas the middle or centre of the section.\r\n\r\nNearly, perhaps quite, all the original surveys are to some extent\r\nerroneous, and in some of the sections, greatly so. In each of the latter,\r\nit is obvious that a more equitable mode of division than the above might\r\nbe adopted; but as error is infinitely various perhaps no better single\r\nrules can be prescribed.\r\n\r\nAt all events I think the above has been prescribed by the competent\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Jany. 6, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. W. DELAHAY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 4, 1859.\r\n\r\nM. W. DELAHAY, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Your second letter in relation to my being with you at your\r\nRepublican convention was duly received. It is not at hand just now, but I\r\nhave the impression from it that the convention was to be at Leavenworth;\r\nbut day before yesterday a friend handed me a letter from Judge M. F.\r\nCaraway, in which he also expresses a wish for me to come, and he fixes\r\nthe place at Ossawatomie. This I believe is off of the river, and will\r\nrequire more time and labor to get to it. It will push me hard to get\r\nthere without injury to my own business; but I shall try to do it, though\r\nI am not yet quite certain I shall succeed.\r\n\r\nI should like to know before coming, that while some of you wish me to\r\ncome, there may not be others who would quite as lief I would stay away.\r\nWrite me again.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. M. MORRIS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 28, 1859.\r\n\r\nW. M. MORRIS, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your kind note inviting me to deliver a lecture at Galesburg is\r\nreceived. I regret to say I cannot do so now; I must stick to the courts\r\nawhile. I read a sort of lecture to three different audiences during the\r\nlast month and this; but I did so under circumstances which made it a\r\nwaste of no time whatever.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. L. PIERCE AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April 6, 1859.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your kind note inviting me to attend a festival in Boston, on\r\nthe 28th instant, in honor of the birthday of Thomas Jefferson, was duly\r\nreceived. My engagements are such that I cannot attend.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that about seventy years ago two great political parties\r\nwere first formed in this country, that Thomas Jefferson was the head of\r\none of them and Boston the headquarters of the other, it is both curious\r\nand interesting that those supposed to descend politically from the party\r\nopposed to Jefferson should now be celebrating his birthday in their own\r\noriginal seat of empire, while those claiming political descent from him\r\nhave nearly ceased to breathe his name everywhere.\r\n\r\nRemembering, too, that the Jefferson party was formed upon its supposed\r\nsuperior devotion to the personal rights of men, holding the rights of\r\nproperty to be secondary only, and greatly inferior, and assuming that the\r\nso-called Democracy of to-day are the Jefferson, and their opponents\r\nthe anti-Jefferson, party, it will be equally interesting to note how\r\ncompletely the two have changed hands as to the principle upon which they\r\nwere originally supposed to be divided. The Democracy of to-day hold the\r\nliberty of one man to be absolutely nothing, when in conflict with another\r\nman's right of property; Republicans, on the contrary, are for both the\r\nman and the dollar, but in case of conflict the man before the dollar.\r\n\r\nI remember being once much amused at seeing two partially intoxicated men\r\nengaged in a fight with their great-coats on, which fight, after a long\r\nand rather harmless contest, ended in each having fought himself out of\r\nhis own coat and into that of the other. If the two leading parties of\r\nthis day are really identical with the two in the days of Jefferson and\r\nAdams, they have performed the same feat as the two drunken men.\r\n\r\nBut soberly, it is now no child's play to save the principles of Jefferson\r\nfrom total overthrow in this nation. One would state with great confidence\r\nthat he could convince any sane child that the simpler propositions of\r\nEuclid are true; but nevertheless he would fail, utterly, with one who\r\nshould deny the definitions and axioms. The principles of Jefferson are\r\nthe definitions and axioms of free society. And yet they are denied\r\nand evaded, with no small show of success. One dashingly calls them\r\n\"glittering generalities.\" Another bluntly calls them \"self-evident lies.\"\r\nAnd others insidiously argue that they apply to \"superior races.\" These\r\nexpressions, differing in form, are identical in object and effect--the\r\nsupplanting the principles of free government, and restoring those of\r\nclassification, caste, and legitimacy. They would delight a convocation\r\nof crowned heads plotting against the people. They are the vanguard, the\r\nminers and sappers, of returning despotism. We must repulse them, or they\r\nwill subjugate us. This is a world of compensation; and he who would be\r\nno slave must consent to have no slave. Those who deny freedom to others\r\ndeserve it not for themselves, and, under a just God, cannot long retain\r\nit. All honor to Jefferson to the man who, in the concrete pressure of a\r\nstruggle for national independence by a single people, had the coolness,\r\nforecast, and capacity to introduce into a mere revolutionary document an\r\nabstract truth, applicable to all men and all times, and so to embalm\r\nit there that to-day and in all coming days it shall be a rebuke and\r\na stumbling-block to the very harbingers of reappearing tyranny and\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. CANISIUS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, May 17, 1859.\r\n\r\nDR. THEODORE CANISIUS.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your note asking, in behalf of yourself and other German\r\ncitizens, whether I am for or against the constitutional provision in\r\nregard to naturalized citizens, lately adopted by Massachusetts, and\r\nwhether I am for or against a fusion of the Republicans and other\r\nopposition elements for the canvass of 1860, is received.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts is a sovereign and independent State; and it is no privilege\r\nof mine to scold her for what she does. Still, if from what she has done\r\nan inference is sought to be drawn as to what I would do, I may\r\nwithout impropriety speak out. I say, then, that, as I understand the\r\nMassachusetts provision, I am against its adoption in Illinois, or in any\r\nother place where I have a right to oppose it. Understanding the spirit of\r\nour institutions to aim at the elevation of men, I am opposed to whatever\r\ntends to degrade them. I have some little notoriety for commiserating the\r\noppressed negro; and I should be strangely inconsistent if I could favor\r\nany project for curtailing the existing rights of white men, even though\r\nborn in different lands, and speaking different languages from myself.\r\nAs to the matter of fusion, I am for it if it can be had on Republican\r\ngrounds; and I am not for it on any other terms. A fusion on any other\r\nterms would be as foolish as unprincipled. It would lose the whole North,\r\nwhile the common enemy would still carry the whole South. The question of\r\nmen is a different one. There are good, patriotic men and able statesmen\r\nin the South whom I would cheerfully support, if they would now place\r\nthemselves on Republican ground, but I am against letting down the\r\nRepublican standard a hairsbreadth.\r\n\r\nI have written this hastily, but I believe it answers your questions\r\nsubstantially.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR, AUDITOR, AND TREASURER OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nIn reply to your inquiry; requesting our written opinion as to what your\r\nduty requires you to do in executing the latter clause of the Seventh\r\nSection of \"An Act in relation to the payment of the principal and\r\ninterest of the State debt,\" approved Feb'y 22, 1859, we reply that\r\nsaid last clause of said section is certainly indefinite, general, and\r\nambiguous in its description of the bonds to be issued by you; giving no\r\ntime at which the bonds are to be made payable, no place at which either\r\nprincipal or interest are to be paid, and no rate of interest which the\r\nbonds are to bear; nor any other description except that they are to be\r\ncoupon bonds, which in commercial usage means interest-paying bonds\r\nwith obligations or orders attached to them for the payment of annual or\r\nsemiannual interest; there is we suppose no difficulty in ascertaining,\r\nif this act stood alone, what ought to be the construction of the terms\r\n\"coupon bonds\" and that it, would mean bonds bearing interest from the\r\ntime of issuing the same. And under this act considered by itself the\r\ncreditors would have a right to require such bonds. But your inquiry in\r\nregard to a class of bonds on which no interest is to be paid or shall\r\nbegin to run until January 1, 1860, is whether the Act of February 18,\r\n1857, would not authorize you to refuse to give bonds with any coupons\r\nattached payable before the first day of July, 1860. We have very maturely\r\nconsidered this question and have arrived at the conclusion that you have\r\na right to use such measures as will secure the State against the loss of\r\nsix months' interest on these bonds by the indefiniteness of the Act of\r\n1859. While it cannot be denied that the letter of the laws favor the\r\nconstruction claimed by some of the creditors that interest-bearing bonds\r\nwere required to be issued to them, inasmuch as the restriction that no\r\ninterest is to run on said bonds until 1st January, 1860, relates solely\r\nto the bonds issued under the Act of 1857. And the Act of 1859 directing\r\nyou to issue new bonds does not contain this restriction, but directs you\r\nto issue coupon bonds. Nevertheless the very indefiniteness and generality\r\nof the Act of 1859, giving no rate of interest, no time due, no place of\r\npayment, no postponement of the time when interest commences, necessarily\r\nimplies that the Legislature intended to invest you with a discretion to\r\nimpose such terms and restrictions as would protect the interest of the\r\nState; and we think you have a right and that it is your duty to see that\r\nthe State Bonds are so issued that the State shall not lose six months'\r\ninterest. Two plans present themselves either of which will secure the\r\nState. 1st. If in literal compliance with the law you issue bonds bearing\r\ninterest from 1st July, 1859, you may deduct from the bonds presented\r\nthree thousand from every $100,000 of bonds and issue $97,000 of\r\ncoupon bonds; by this plan $3000 out of $100,000 of principal would be\r\nextinguished in consideration of paying $2910 interest on the first of\r\nJanuary, 1860--and the interest on the $3000 would forever cease; this\r\nwould be no doubt most advantageous to the State. But if the Auditor\r\nwill not consent to this, then, 2nd. Cut off of each bond all the coupons\r\npayable before 1st July, 1860.\r\n\r\nOne of these plans would undoubtedly have been prescribed by the\r\nLegislature if its attention had been directed to this question.\r\n\r\nMay 28, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON LINCOLN'S SCRAP BOOK\r\n\r\nTO H. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, December 25, 1858.\r\n\r\nH. C. WHITNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have just received yours of the 23rd inquiring whether I\r\nreceived the newspapers you sent me by express. I did receive them, and\r\nam very much obliged. There is some probability that my scrap-book will be\r\nreprinted, and if it shall, I will save you a copy.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1859\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SUGGESTION OF A PRESIDENTIAL OFFER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO S. GALLOWAY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., July 28, 1859.\r\n\r\nHON. SAMUEL GALLOWAY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your very complimentary, not to say flattering, letter of\r\nthe 23d inst. is received. Dr. Reynolds had induced me to expect you here;\r\nand I was disappointed not a little by your failure to come. And yet I\r\nfear you have formed an estimate of me which can scarcely be sustained on\r\na personal acquaintance.\r\n\r\nTwo things done by the Ohio Republican convention--the repudiation of\r\nJudge Swan, and the \"plank\" for a repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law--I very\r\nmuch regretted. These two things are of a piece; and they are viewed by\r\nmany good men, sincerely opposed to slavery, as a struggle against, and in\r\ndisregard of, the Constitution itself. And it is the very thing that\r\nwill greatly endanger our cause, if it be not kept out of our national\r\nconvention. There is another thing our friends are doing which gives me\r\nsome uneasiness. It is their leaning toward \"popular sovereignty.\" There\r\nare three substantial objections to this: First, no party can command\r\nrespect which sustains this year what it opposed last. Secondly, Douglas\r\n(who is the most dangerous enemy of liberty, because the most insidious\r\none) would have little support in the North, and by consequence, no\r\ncapital to trade on in the South, if it were not for his friends thus\r\nmagnifying him and his humbug. But lastly, and chiefly, Douglas's popular\r\nsovereignty, accepted by the public mind as a just principle, nationalizes\r\nslavery, and revives the African slave trade inevitably.\r\n\r\nTaking slaves into new Territories, and buying slaves in Africa, are\r\nidentical things, identical rights or identical wrongs, and the argument\r\nwhich establishes one will establish the other. Try a thousand years for\r\na sound reason why Congress shall not hinder the people of Kansas from\r\nhaving slaves, and, when you have found it, it will be an equally good one\r\nwhy Congress should not hinder the people of Georgia from importing slaves\r\nfrom Africa.\r\n\r\nAs to Governor Chase, I have a kind side for him. He was one of the few\r\ndistinguished men of the nation who gave us, in Illinois, their sympathy\r\nlast year. I never saw him, but suppose him to be able and right-minded;\r\nbut still he may not be the most suitable as a candidate for the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nI must say I do not think myself fit for the Presidency. As you propose a\r\ncorrespondence with me, I shall look for your letters anxiously.\r\n\r\nI have not met Dr. Reynolds since receiving your letter; but when I shall,\r\nI will present your respects as requested.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT IS BAD TO BE POOR.\r\n\r\nTO HAWKINS TAYLOR\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. Sept. 6, 1859.\r\n\r\nHAWKINS TAYLOR, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 3d is just received. There is some mistake about\r\nmy expected attendance of the U.S. Court in your city on the 3d Tuesday of\r\nthis month. I have had no thought of being there.\r\n\r\nIt is bad to be poor. I shall go to the wall for bread and meat if I\r\nneglect my business this year as well as last. It would please me much\r\nto see the city and good people of Keokuk, but for this year it is little\r\nless than an impossibility. I am constantly receiving invitations which I\r\nam compelled to decline. I was pressingly urged to go to Minnesota; and I\r\nnow have two invitations to go to Ohio. These last are prompted by Douglas\r\ngoing there; and I am really tempted to make a flying trip to Columbus and\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\nI do hope you will have no serious trouble in Iowa. What thinks Grimes\r\nabout it? I have not known him to be mistaken about an election in Iowa.\r\nPresent my respects to Col. Carter, and any other friends, and believe me\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT COLUMBUS, OHIO.\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 16, 1859.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF OHIO: I cannot fail to remember that I\r\nappear for the first time before an audience in this now great State,--an\r\naudience that is accustomed to hear such speakers as Corwin, and Chase,\r\nand Wade, and many other renowned men; and, remembering this, I feel\r\nthat it will be well for you, as for me, that you should not raise your\r\nexpectations to that standard to which you would have been justified in\r\nraising them had one of these distinguished men appeared before you. You\r\nwould perhaps be only preparing a disappointment for yourselves, and, as\r\na consequence of your disappointment, mortification to me. I hope,\r\ntherefore, that you will commence with very moderate expectations; and\r\nperhaps, if you will give me your attention, I shall be able to interest\r\nyou to a moderate degree.\r\n\r\nAppearing here for the first time in my life, I have been somewhat\r\nembarrassed for a topic by way of introduction to my speech; but I have\r\nbeen relieved from that embarrassment by an introduction which the Ohio\r\nStatesman newspaper gave me this morning. In this paper I have read an\r\narticle, in which, among other statements, I find the following:\r\n\r\n\"In debating with Senator Douglas during the memorable contest of last\r\nfall, Mr. Lincoln declared in favor of negro suffrage, and attempted to\r\ndefend that vile conception against the Little Giant.\"\r\n\r\nI mention this now, at the opening of my remarks, for the purpose of\r\nmaking three comments upon it. The first I have already announced,--it\r\nfurnishes me an introductory topic; the second is to show that the\r\ngentleman is mistaken; thirdly, to give him an opportunity to correct it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, in regard to this matter being a mistake. I have found\r\nthat it is not entirely safe, when one is misrepresented under his very\r\nnose, to allow the misrepresentation to go uncontradicted. I\r\ntherefore propose, here at the outset, not only to say that this is a\r\nmisrepresentation, but to show conclusively that it is so; and you will\r\nbear with me while I read a couple of extracts from that very \"memorable\"\r\ndebate with Judge Douglas last year, to which this newspaper refers. In\r\nthe first pitched battle which Senator Douglas and myself had, at the\r\ntown of Ottawa, I used the language which I will now read. Having been\r\npreviously reading an extract, I continued as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length, but this is\r\nthe true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution\r\nof slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it; and anything that\r\nargues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the\r\nnegro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a\r\nman can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse. I will say here,\r\nwhile upon this subject, that I have no purpose directly or indirectly to\r\ninterfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists.\r\nI believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do\r\nso. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between\r\nthe white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the\r\ntwo which, in my judgment, will probably forbid their ever living together\r\nupon the footing of perfect equality; and inasmuch as it becomes a\r\nnecessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas,\r\nam in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I\r\nhave never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding\r\nall this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to\r\nall the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence,--the\r\nright to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as\r\nmuch entitled to these as the white man. I agree with judge Douglas, he\r\nis not my equal in many respects,--certainly not in color, perhaps not\r\nin moral or intellectual endowments. But in the right to eat the bread,\r\nwithout leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal,\r\nand the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.\"\r\n\r\nUpon a subsequent occasion, when the reason for making a statement like\r\nthis occurred, I said:\r\n\r\n\"While I was at the hotel to-day an elderly gentleman called upon me to\r\nknow whether I was really in favor of producing perfect equality between\r\nthe negroes and white people. While I had not proposed to myself on this\r\noccasion to say much on that subject, yet, as the question was asked me, I\r\nthought I would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard\r\nto it. I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of\r\nbringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white\r\nand black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making\r\nvoters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, or\r\nintermarry with the white people; and I will say in addition to this that\r\nthere is a physical difference between the white and black races which\r\nI believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of\r\nsocial and political equality. And inasmuch as they can not so live,\r\nwhile they do remain together there must be the position of superior\r\nand inferior, and I, as much as any other man, am in favor of having the\r\nsuperior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion\r\nI do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior\r\nposition, the negro should be denied everything. I do not understand that\r\nbecause I do not want a negro woman for a slave, I must necessarily want\r\nher for a wife. My understanding is that I can just let her alone. I am\r\nnow in my fiftieth year, and I certainly never have had a black woman for\r\neither a slave or a wife. So it seems to me quite possible for us to get\r\nalong without making either slaves or wives of negroes. I will add to this\r\nthat I have never seen, to my knowledge, a man, woman, or child, who was\r\nin favor of producing perfect equality, social and political, between\r\nnegroes and white men. I recollect of but one distinguished instance that\r\nI ever heard of so frequently as to be satisfied of its correctness, and\r\nthat is the case of Judge Douglas's old friend Colonel Richard M. Johnson.\r\nI will also add to the remarks I have made (for I am not going to enter\r\nat large upon this subject), that I have never had the least apprehension\r\nthat I or my friends would marry negroes, if there was no law to keep\r\nthem from it; but as judge Douglas and his friends seem to be in great\r\napprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I\r\ngive him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the\r\nlaw of the State which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes.\"\r\n\r\nThere, my friends, you have briefly what I have, upon former occasions,\r\nsaid upon this subject to which this newspaper, to the extent of its\r\nability, has drawn the public attention. In it you not only perceive, as a\r\nprobability, that in that contest I did not at any time say I was in favor\r\nof negro suffrage, but the absolute proof that twice--once substantially,\r\nand once expressly--I declared against it. Having shown you this, there\r\nremains but a word of comment upon that newspaper article. It is this,\r\nthat I presume the editor of that paper is an honest and truth-loving man,\r\nand that he will be greatly obliged to me for furnishing him thus early\r\nan opportunity to correct the misrepresentation he has made, before it has\r\nrun so long that malicious people can call him a liar.\r\n\r\nThe Giant himself has been here recently. I have seen a brief report of\r\nhis speech. If it were otherwise unpleasant to me to introduce the subject\r\nof the negro as a topic for discussion, I might be somewhat relieved by\r\nthe fact that he dealt exclusively in that subject while he was here. I\r\nshall, therefore, without much hesitation or diffidence, enter upon this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe American people, on the first day of January, 1854, found the African\r\nslave trade prohibited by a law of Congress. In a majority of the States\r\nof this Union, they found African slavery, or any other sort of slavery,\r\nprohibited by State constitutions. They also found a law existing,\r\nsupposed to be valid, by which slavery was excluded from almost all the\r\nterritory the United States then owned. This was the condition of the\r\ncountry, with reference to the institution of slavery, on the first of\r\nJanuary, 1854. A few days after that, a bill was introduced into Congress,\r\nwhich ran through its regular course in the two branches of the national\r\nlegislature, and finally passed into a law in the month of May, by which\r\nthe Act of Congress prohibiting slavery from going into the Territories of\r\nthe United States was repealed. In connection with the law itself, and, in\r\nfact, in the terms of the law, the then existing prohibition was not only\r\nrepealed, but there was a declaration of a purpose on the part of Congress\r\nnever thereafter to exercise any power that they might have, real or\r\nsupposed, to prohibit the extension or spread of slavery. This was a very\r\ngreat change; for the law thus repealed was of more than thirty years'\r\nstanding. Following rapidly upon the heels of this action of Congress,\r\na decision of the Supreme Court is made, by which it is declared that\r\nCongress, if it desires to prohibit the spread of slavery into the\r\nTerritories, has no constitutional power to do so. Not only so, but\r\nthat decision lays down principles which, if pushed to their logical\r\nconclusion,--I say pushed to their logical conclusion,--would decide\r\nthat the constitutions of free States, forbidding slavery, are themselves\r\nunconstitutional. Mark me, I do not say the judges said this, and let\r\nno man say I affirm the judges used these words; but I only say it is my\r\nopinion that what they did say, if pressed to its logical conclusion, will\r\ninevitably result thus.\r\n\r\nLooking at these things, the Republican party, as I understand its\r\nprinciples and policy, believes that there is great danger of the\r\ninstitution of slavery being spread out and extended until it is\r\nultimately made alike lawful in all the States of this Union; so\r\nbelieving, to prevent that incidental and ultimate consummation is the\r\noriginal and chief purpose of the Republican organization. I say \"chief\r\npurpose\" of the Republican organization; for it is certainly true that if\r\nthe National House shall fall into the hands of the Republicans, they will\r\nhave to attend to all the other matters of national house-keeping, as well\r\nas this. The chief and real purpose of the Republican party is eminently\r\nconservative. It proposes nothing save and except to restore this\r\ngovernment to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery, and\r\nthere to maintain it, looking for no further change in reference to it\r\nthan that which the original framers of the Government themselves expected\r\nand looked forward to.\r\n\r\nThe chief danger to this purpose of the Republican party is not just now\r\nthe revival of the African slave trade, or the passage of a Congressional\r\nslave code, or the declaring of a second Dred Scott decision, making\r\nslavery lawful in all the States. These are not pressing us just now. They\r\nare not quite ready yet. The authors of these measures know that we are\r\ntoo strong for them; but they will be upon us in due time, and we will be\r\ngrappling with them hand to hand, if they are not now headed off. They are\r\nnot now the chief danger to the purpose of the Republican organization;\r\nbut the most imminent danger that now threatens that purpose is that\r\ninsidious Douglas popular sovereignty. This is the miner and sapper. While\r\nit does not propose to revive the African slave trade, nor to pass a slave\r\ncode, nor to make a second Dred Scott decision, it is preparing us for the\r\nonslaught and charge of these ultimate enemies when they shall be ready to\r\ncome on, and the word of command for them to advance shall be given. I say\r\nthis \"Douglas popular sovereignty\"; for there is a broad distinction, as I\r\nnow understand it, between that article and a genuine popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\nI believe there is a genuine popular sovereignty. I think a definition of\r\n\"genuine popular sovereignty,\" in the abstract, would be about this: That\r\neach man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself, and with all\r\nthose things which exclusively concern him. Applied to government, this\r\nprinciple would be, that a general government shall do all those things\r\nwhich pertain to it, and all the local governments shall do precisely as\r\nthey please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them. I\r\nunderstand that this government of the United States, under which we live,\r\nis based upon this principle; and I am misunderstood if it is supposed\r\nthat I have any war to make upon that principle.\r\n\r\nNow, what is judge Douglas's popular sovereignty? It is, as a principle,\r\nno other than that if one man chooses to make a slave of another man\r\nneither that other man nor anybody else has a right to object. Applied in\r\ngovernment, as he seeks to apply it, it is this: If, in a new Territory\r\ninto which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making\r\ntheir homes, they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits or to\r\nestablish it there, however one or the other may affect the persons to be\r\nenslaved, or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterwards\r\nto inhabit that Territory, or the other members of the families of\r\ncommunities, of which they are but an incipient member, or the general\r\nhead of the family of States as parent of all, however their action may\r\naffect one or the other of these, there is no power or right to interfere.\r\nThat is Douglas's popular sovereignty applied.\r\n\r\nHe has a good deal of trouble with popular sovereignty. His explanations\r\nexplanatory of explanations explained are interminable. The most lengthy,\r\nand, as I suppose, the most maturely considered of this long series of\r\nexplanations is his great essay in Harper's Magazine. I will not attempt\r\nto enter on any very thorough investigation of his argument as there made\r\nand presented. I will nevertheless occupy a good portion of your time here\r\nin drawing your attention to certain points in it. Such of you as may\r\nhave read this document will have perceived that the judge early in the\r\ndocument quotes from two persons as belonging to the Republican party,\r\nwithout naming them, but who can readily be recognized as being Governor\r\nSeward of New York and myself. It is true that exactly fifteen months ago\r\nthis day, I believe, I for the first time expressed a sentiment upon this\r\nsubject, and in such a manner that it should get into print, that the\r\npublic might see it beyond the circle of my hearers; and my expression of\r\nit at that time is the quotation that Judge Douglas makes. He has not made\r\nthe quotation with accuracy, but justice to him requires me to say that it\r\nis sufficiently accurate not to change the sense.\r\n\r\nThe sense of that quotation condensed is this: that this slavery element\r\nis a durable element of discord among us, and that we shall probably not\r\nhave perfect peace in this country with it until it either masters the\r\nfree principle in our government, or is so far mastered by the free\r\nprinciple as for the public mind to rest in the belief that it is going to\r\nits end. This sentiment, which I now express in this way, was, at no great\r\ndistance of time, perhaps in different language, and in connection with\r\nsome collateral ideas, expressed by Governor Seward. Judge Douglas has\r\nbeen so much annoyed by the expression of that sentiment that he has\r\nconstantly, I believe, in almost all his speeches since it was uttered,\r\nbeen referring to it. I find he alluded to it in his speech here, as well\r\nas in the copyright essay. I do not now enter upon this for the purpose of\r\nmaking an elaborate argument to show that we were right in the expression\r\nof that sentiment. In other words, I shall not stop to say all that might\r\nproperly be said upon this point, but I only ask your attention to it for\r\nthe purpose of making one or two points upon it.\r\n\r\nIf you will read the copyright essay, you will discover that judge\r\nDouglas himself says a controversy between the American Colonies and the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain began on the slavery question in 1699, and\r\ncontinued from that time until the Revolution; and, while he did not say\r\nso, we all know that it has continued with more or less violence ever\r\nsince the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThen we need not appeal to history, to the declarations of the framers of\r\nthe government, but we know from judge Douglas himself that slavery began\r\nto be an element of discord among the white people of this country as far\r\nback as 1699, or one hundred and sixty years ago, or five generations of\r\nmen,--counting thirty years to a generation. Now, it would seem to me that\r\nit might have occurred to Judge Douglas, or anybody who had turned his\r\nattention to these facts, that there was something in the nature of that\r\nthing, slavery, somewhat durable for mischief and discord.\r\n\r\nThere is another point I desire to make in regard to this matter, before\r\nI leave it. From the adoption of the Constitution down to 1820 is the\r\nprecise period of our history when we had comparative peace upon this\r\nquestion,--the precise period of time when we came nearer to having peace\r\nabout it than any other time of that entire one hundred and sixty years\r\nin which he says it began, or of the eighty years of our own Constitution.\r\nThen it would be worth our while to stop and examine into the probable\r\nreason of our coming nearer to having peace then than at any other time.\r\nThis was the precise period of time in which our fathers adopted, and\r\nduring which they followed, a policy restricting the spread of slavery,\r\nand the whole Union was acquiescing in it. The whole country looked\r\nforward to the ultimate extinction of the institution. It was when a\r\npolicy had been adopted, and was prevailing, which led all just and\r\nright-minded men to suppose that slavery was gradually coming to an end,\r\nand that they might be quiet about it, watching it as it expired. I think\r\nJudge Douglas might have perceived that too; and whether he did or not, it\r\nis worth the attention of fair-minded men, here and elsewhere, to consider\r\nwhether that is not the truth of the case. If he had looked at these two\r\nfacts,--that this matter has been an element of discord for one hundred\r\nand sixty years among this people, and that the only comparative peace we\r\nhave had about it was when that policy prevailed in this government which\r\nhe now wars upon, he might then, perhaps, have been brought to a more just\r\nappreciation of what I said fifteen months ago,--that \"a house divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand. I believe that this government cannot endure\r\npermanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the house to fall,\r\nI do not expect the Union to dissolve; but I do expect it will cease to\r\nbe divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the\r\nopponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it\r\nwhere the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of\r\nultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward until it shall\r\nbecome alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well\r\nas South.\" That was my sentiment at that time. In connection with it, I\r\nsaid: \"We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was inaugurated\r\nwith the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery\r\nagitation. Under the operation of the policy that agitation has not only\r\nnot ceased, but has constantly augmented.\" I now say to you here that we\r\nare advanced still farther into the sixth year since that policy of\r\nJudge Douglas--that popular sovereignty of his--for quieting the slavery\r\nquestion was made the national policy. Fifteen months more have been\r\nadded since I uttered that sentiment; and I call upon you and all other\r\nright-minded men to say whether that fifteen months have belied or\r\ncorroborated my words.\r\n\r\nWhile I am here upon this subject, I cannot but express gratitude that\r\nthis true view of this element of discord among us--as I believe it is--is\r\nattracting more and more attention. I do not believe that Governor Seward\r\nuttered that sentiment because I had done so before, but because he\r\nreflected upon this subject and saw the truth of it. Nor do I believe\r\nbecause Governor Seward or I uttered it that Mr. Hickman of Pennsylvania,\r\nin, different language, since that time, has declared his belief in\r\nthe utter antagonism which exists between the principles of liberty and\r\nslavery. You see we are multiplying. Now, while I am speaking of Hickman,\r\nlet me say, I know but little about him. I have never seen him, and know\r\nscarcely anything about the man; but I will say this much of him: Of all\r\nthe anti-Lecompton Democracy that have been brought to my notice, he\r\nalone has the true, genuine ring of the metal. And now, without indorsing\r\nanything else he has said, I will ask this audience to give three cheers\r\nfor Hickman. [The audience responded with three rousing cheers for\r\nHickman.]\r\n\r\nAnother point in the copyright essay to which I would ask your attention\r\nis rather a feature to be extracted from the whole thing, than from any\r\nexpress declaration of it at any point. It is a general feature of that\r\ndocument, and, indeed, of all of Judge Douglas's discussions of this\r\nquestion, that the Territories of the United States and the States of this\r\nUnion are exactly alike; that there is no difference between them at all;\r\nthat the Constitution applies to the Territories precisely as it does to\r\nthe States; and that the United States Government, under the Constitution,\r\nmay not do in a State what it may not do in a Territory, and what it must\r\ndo in a State it must do in a Territory. Gentlemen, is that a true view of\r\nthe case? It is necessary for this squatter sovereignty, but is it true?\r\n\r\nLet us consider. What does it depend upon? It depends altogether upon the\r\nproposition that the States must, without the interference of the\r\nGeneral Government, do all those things that pertain exclusively to\r\nthemselves,--that are local in their nature, that have no connection\r\nwith the General Government. After Judge Douglas has established this\r\nproposition, which nobody disputes or ever has disputed, he proceeds\r\nto assume, without proving it, that slavery is one of those little,\r\nunimportant, trivial matters which are of just about as much consequence\r\nas the question would be to me whether my neighbor should raise horned\r\ncattle or plant tobacco; that there is no moral question about it, but\r\nthat it is altogether a matter of dollars and cents; that when a new\r\nTerritory is opened for settlement, the first man who goes into it may\r\nplant there a thing which, like the Canada thistle or some other of those\r\npests of the soil, cannot be dug out by the millions of men who will come\r\nthereafter; that it is one of those little things that is so trivial in\r\nits nature that it has nor effect upon anybody save the few men who first\r\nplant upon the soil; that it is not a thing which in any way affects the\r\nfamily of communities composing these States, nor any way endangers the\r\nGeneral Government. Judge Douglas ignores altogether the very well known\r\nfact that we have never had a serious menace to our political existence,\r\nexcept it sprang from this thing, which he chooses to regard as only upon\r\na par with onions and potatoes.\r\n\r\nTurn it, and contemplate it in another view. He says that, according\r\nto his popular sovereignty, the General Government may give to the\r\nTerritories governors, judges, marshals, secretaries, and all the other\r\nchief men to govern them, but they, must not touch upon this other\r\nquestion. Why? The question of who shall be governor of a Territory for a\r\nyear or two, and pass away, without his track being left upon the soil, or\r\nan act which he did for good or for evil being left behind, is a question\r\nof vast national magnitude; it is so much opposed in its nature to\r\nlocality that the nation itself must decide it: while this other matter\r\nof planting slavery upon a soil,--a thing which, once planted, cannot be\r\neradicated by the succeeding millions who have as much right there as the\r\nfirst comers, or, if eradicated, not without infinite difficulty and\r\na long struggle, he considers the power to prohibit it as one of these\r\nlittle local, trivial things that the nation ought not to say a word\r\nabout; that it affects nobody save the few men who are there.\r\n\r\nTake these two things and consider them together, present the question of\r\nplanting a State with the institution of slavery by the side of a question\r\nwho shall be Governor of Kansas for a year or two, and is there a man\r\nhere, is there a man on earth, who would not say the governor question\r\nis the little one, and the slavery question is the great one? I ask any\r\nhonest Democrat if the small, the local, and the trivial and temporary\r\nquestion is not, Who shall be governor? while the durable, the important,\r\nand the mischievous one is, Shall this soil be planted with slavery?\r\n\r\nThis is an idea, I suppose, which has arisen in Judge Douglas's mind from\r\nhis peculiar structure. I suppose the institution of slavery really looks\r\nsmall to him. He is so put up by nature that a lash upon his back would\r\nhurt him, but a lash upon anybody else's back does not hurt him. That is\r\nthe build of the man, and consequently he looks upon the matter of slavery\r\nin this unimportant light.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas ought to remember, when he is endeavoring to force this\r\npolicy upon the American people, that while he is put up in that way,\r\na good many are not. He ought to remember that there was once in\r\nthis country a man by the name of Thomas Jefferson, supposed to be a\r\nDemocrat,--a man whose principles and policy are not very prevalent\r\namongst Democrats to-day, it is true; but that man did not take exactly\r\nthis view of the insignificance of the element of slavery which our friend\r\njudge Douglas does. In contemplation of this thing, we all know he was led\r\nto exclaim, \"I tremble for my country when I remember that God is just!\"\r\nWe know how he looked upon it when he thus expressed himself. There was\r\ndanger to this country,--danger of the avenging justice of God, in that\r\nlittle unimportant popular sovereignty question of judge Douglas. He\r\nsupposed there was a question of God's eternal justice wrapped up in the\r\nenslaving of any race of men, or any man, and that those who did so braved\r\nthe arm of Jehovah; that when a nation thus dared the Almighty, every\r\nfriend of that nation had cause to dread his wrath. Choose ye between\r\nJefferson and Douglas as to what is the true view of this element among\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThere is another little difficulty about this matter of treating the\r\nTerritories and States alike in all things, to which I ask your attention,\r\nand I shall leave this branch of the case. If there is no difference\r\nbetween them, why not make the Territories States at once? What is\r\nthe reason that Kansas was not fit to come into the Union when it was\r\norganized into a Territory, in Judge Douglas's view? Can any of you tell\r\nany reason why it should not have come into the Union at once? They are\r\nfit, as he thinks, to decide upon the slavery question,--the largest and\r\nmost important with which they could possibly deal: what could they do by\r\ncoming into the Union that they are not fit to do, according to his view,\r\nby staying out of it? Oh, they are not fit to sit in Congress and decide\r\nupon the rates of postage, or questions of ad valorem or specific duties\r\non foreign goods, or live-oak timber contracts, they are not fit to decide\r\nthese vastly important matters, which are national in their import, but\r\nthey are fit, \"from the jump,\" to decide this little negro question. But,\r\ngentlemen, the case is too plain; I occupy too much time on this head, and\r\nI pass on.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the copyright essay, the judge, I think, comes very near\r\nkicking his own fat into the fire. I did not think, when I commenced these\r\nremarks, that I would read that article, but I now believe I will:\r\n\r\n\"This exposition of the history of these measures shows conclusively that\r\nthe authors of the Compromise measures of 1850 and of the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nAct of 1854, as well as the members of the Continental Congress of 1774.,\r\nand the founders of our system of government subsequent to the Revolution,\r\nregarded the people of the Territories and Colonies as political\r\ncommunities which were entitled to a free and exclusive power of\r\nlegislation in their provisional legislatures, where their representation\r\ncould alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and internal polity.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the judge saw that putting in the word \"slavery\" would contradict\r\nhis own history, he put in what he knew would pass synonymous with it,\r\n\"internal polity.\" Whenever we find that in one of his speeches, the\r\nsubstitute is used in this manner; and I can tell you the reason. It would\r\nbe too bald a contradiction to say slavery; but \"internal polity\" is a\r\ngeneral phrase, which would pass in some quarters, and which he hopes will\r\npass with the reading community for the same thing.\r\n\r\n\"This right pertains to the people collectively, as a law-abiding and\r\npeaceful community, and not in the isolated individuals who may wander\r\nupon the public domain in violation of the law. It can only be exercised\r\nwhere there are inhabitants sufficient to constitute a government, and\r\ncapable of performing its various functions and duties,--a fact to be\r\nascertained and determined by\" who do you think? Judge Douglas says \"by\r\nCongress!\" \"Whether the number shall be fixed at ten, fifteen or twenty\r\nthousand inhabitants, does not affect the principle.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I have only a few comments to make. Popular sovereignty, by his own\r\nwords, does not pertain to the few persons who wander upon the public\r\ndomain in violation of law. We have his words for that. When it does\r\npertain to them, is when they are sufficient to be formed into an\r\norganized political community, and he fixes the minimum for that at ten\r\nthousand, and the maximum at twenty thousand. Now, I would like to know\r\nwhat is to be done with the nine thousand? Are they all to be treated,\r\nuntil they are large enough to be organized into a political community, as\r\nwanderers upon the public land, in violation of law? And if so treated\r\nand driven out, at what point of time would there ever be ten thousand?\r\nIf they were not driven out, but remained there as trespassers upon the\r\npublic land in violation of the law, can they establish slavery there? No;\r\nthe judge says popular sovereignty don't pertain to them then. Can they\r\nexclude it then? No; popular sovereignty don't pertain to them then. I\r\nwould like to know, in the case covered by the essay, what condition\r\nthe people of the Territory are in before they reach the number of ten\r\nthousand?\r\n\r\nBut the main point I wish to ask attention to is, that the question as\r\nto when they shall have reached a sufficient number to be formed into a\r\nregular organized community is to be decided \"by Congress.\" Judge Douglas\r\nsays so. Well, gentlemen, that is about all we want. No, that is all the\r\nSoutherners want. That is what all those who are for slavery want. They\r\ndo not want Congress to prohibit slavery from coming into the new\r\nTerritories, and they do not want popular sovereignty to hinder it; and as\r\nCongress is to say when they are ready to be organized, all that the South\r\nhas to do is to get Congress to hold off. Let Congress hold off until they\r\nare ready to be admitted as a State, and the South has all it wants in\r\ntaking slavery into and planting it in all the Territories that we now\r\nhave or hereafter may have. In a word, the whole thing, at a dash of the\r\npen, is at last put in the power of Congress; for if they do not have this\r\npopular sovereignty until Congress organizes them, I ask if it at last\r\ndoes not come from Congress? If, at last, it amounts to anything at all,\r\nCongress gives it to them. I submit this rather for your reflection\r\nthan for comment. After all that is said, at last, by a dash of the pen,\r\neverything that has gone before is undone, and he puts the whole question\r\nunder the control of Congress. After fighting through more than three\r\nhours, if you undertake to read it, he at last places the whole matter\r\nunder the control of that power which he has been contending against, and\r\narrives at a result directly contrary to what he had been laboring to do.\r\nHe at last leaves the whole matter to the control of Congress.\r\n\r\nThere are two main objects, as I understand it, of this Harper's Magazine\r\nessay. One was to show, if possible, that the men of our Revolutionary\r\ntimes were in favor of his popular sovereignty, and the other was to show\r\nthat the Dred Scott decision had not entirely squelched out this popular\r\nsovereignty. I do not propose, in regard to this argument drawn from\r\nthe history of former times, to enter into a detailed examination of the\r\nhistorical statements he has made. I have the impression that they are\r\ninaccurate in a great many instances,--sometimes in positive statement,\r\nbut very much more inaccurate by the suppression of statements that really\r\nbelong to the history. But I do not propose to affirm that this is so to\r\nany very great extent, or to enter into a very minute examination of his\r\nhistorical statements. I avoid doing so upon this principle,--that if it\r\nwere important for me to pass out of this lot in the least period of time\r\npossible, and I came to that fence, and saw by a calculation of my known\r\nstrength and agility that I could clear it at a bound, it would be folly\r\nfor me to stop and consider whether I could or not crawl through a crack.\r\nSo I say of the whole history contained in his essay where he endeavored\r\nto link the men of the Revolution to popular sovereignty. It only requires\r\nan effort to leap out of it, a single bound to be entirely successful.\r\nIf you read it over, you will find that he quotes here and there from\r\ndocuments of the Revolutionary times, tending to show that the people of\r\nthe colonies were desirous of regulating their own concerns in their own\r\nway, that the British Government should not interfere; that at one time\r\nthey struggled with the British Government to be permitted to exclude\r\nthe African slave trade,--if not directly, to be permitted to exclude\r\nit indirectly, by taxation sufficient to discourage and destroy it. From\r\nthese and many things of this sort, judge Douglas argues that they were\r\nin favor of the people of our own Territories excluding slavery if they\r\nwanted to, or planting it there if they wanted to, doing just as they\r\npleased from the time they settled upon the Territory. Now, however his\r\nhistory may apply and whatever of his argument there may be that is sound\r\nand accurate or unsound and inaccurate, if we can find out what these men\r\ndid themselves do upon this very question of slavery in the Territories,\r\ndoes it not end the whole thing? If, after all this labor and effort\r\nto show that the men of the Revolution were in favor of his popular\r\nsovereignty and his mode of dealing with slavery in the Territories, we\r\ncan show that these very men took hold of that subject, and dealt with\r\nit, we can see for ourselves how they dealt with it. It is not a matter of\r\nargument or inference, but we know what they thought about it.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely upon that part of the history of the country that one\r\nimportant omission is made by Judge Douglas. He selects parts of the\r\nhistory of the United States upon the subject of slavery, and treats it as\r\nthe whole, omitting from his historical sketch the legislation of Congress\r\nin regard to the admission of Missouri, by which the Missouri Compromise\r\nwas established and slavery excluded from a country half as large as the\r\npresent United States. All this is left out of his history, and in nowise\r\nalluded to by him, so far as I can remember, save once, when he makes\r\na remark, that upon his principle the Supreme Court were authorized to\r\npronounce a decision that the act called the Missouri Compromise was\r\nunconstitutional. All that history has been left out. But this part of the\r\nhistory of the country was not made by the men of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThere was another part of our political history, made by the very men\r\nwho were the actors in the Revolution, which has taken the name of the\r\nOrdinance of '87. Let me bring that history to your attention. In 1784, I\r\nbelieve, this same Mr. Jefferson drew up an ordinance for the government\r\nof the country upon which we now stand, or, rather, a frame or draft of an\r\nordinance for the government of this country, here in Ohio, our neighbors\r\nin Indiana, us who live in Illinois, our neighbors in Wisconsin and\r\nMichigan. In that ordinance, drawn up not only for the government of that\r\nTerritory, but for the Territories south of the Ohio River, Mr. Jefferson\r\nexpressly provided for the prohibition of slavery. Judge Douglas says,\r\nand perhaps is right, that that provision was lost from that ordinance. I\r\nbelieve that is true. When the vote was taken upon it, a majority of all\r\npresent in the Congress of the Confederation voted for it; but there were\r\nso many absentees that those voting for it did not make the clear majority\r\nnecessary, and it was lost. But three years after that, the Congress of\r\nthe Confederation were together again, and they adopted a new ordinance\r\nfor the government of this Northwest Territory, not contemplating\r\nterritory south of the river, for the States owning that territory had\r\nhitherto refrained from giving it to the General Government; hence they\r\nmade the ordinance to apply only to what the Government owned. In fact,\r\nthe provision excluding slavery was inserted aside, passed unanimously, or\r\nat any rate it passed and became a part of the law of the land. Under\r\nthat ordinance we live. First here in Ohio you were a Territory; then an\r\nenabling act was passed, authorizing you to form a constitution and\r\nState Government, provided it was republican and not in conflict with the\r\nOrdinance of '87. When you framed your constitution and presented it for\r\nadmission, I think you will find the legislation upon the subject will\r\nshow that, whereas you had formed a constitution that was republican, and\r\nnot in conflict with the Ordinance of '87, therefore you were admitted\r\nupon equal footing with the original States. The same process in a few\r\nyears was gone through with in Indiana, and so with Illinois, and the same\r\nsubstantially with Michigan and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nNot only did that Ordinance prevail, but it was constantly looked to\r\nwhenever a step was taken by a new Territory to become a State. Congress\r\nalways turned their attention to it, and in all their movements upon\r\nthis subject they traced their course by that Ordinance of '87. When they\r\nadmitted new States, they advertised them of this Ordinance, as a part of\r\nthe legislation of the country. They did so because they had traced the\r\nOrdinance of '87 throughout the history of this country. Begin with the\r\nmen of the Revolution, and go down for sixty entire years, and until the\r\nlast scrap of that Territory comes into the Union in the form of the State\r\nof Wisconsin, everything was made to conform with the Ordinance of '87,\r\nexcluding slavery from that vast extent of country.\r\n\r\nI omitted to mention in the right place that the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States was in process of being framed when that Ordinance was\r\nmade by the Congress of the Confederation; and one of the first Acts of\r\nCongress itself, under the new Constitution itself, was to give force to\r\nthat Ordinance by putting power to carry it out in the hands of the new\r\nofficers under the Constitution, in the place of the old ones, who had\r\nbeen legislated out of existence by the change in the Government from the\r\nConfederation to the Constitution. Not only so, but I believe Indiana once\r\nor twice, if not Ohio, petitioned the General Government for the privilege\r\nof suspending that provision and allowing them to have slaves. A report\r\nmade by Mr. Randolph, of Virginia, himself a slaveholder, was directly\r\nagainst it, and the action was to refuse them the privilege of violating\r\nthe Ordinance of '87.\r\n\r\nThis period of history, which I have run over briefly, is, I presume, as\r\nfamiliar to most of this assembly as any other part of the history of our\r\ncountry. I suppose that few of my hearers are not as familiar with that\r\npart of history as I am, and I only mention it to recall your attention\r\nto it at this time. And hence I ask how extraordinary a thing it is that a\r\nman who has occupied a position upon the floor of the Senate of the United\r\nStates, who is now in his third term, and who looks to see the government\r\nof this whole country fall into his own hands, pretending to give a\r\ntruthful and accurate history o the slavery question in this country,\r\nshould so entirely ignore the whole of that portion of our history--the\r\nmost important of all. Is it not a most extraordinary spectacle that a man\r\nshould stand up and ask for any confidence in his statements who sets out\r\nas he does with portions of history, calling upon the people to believe\r\nthat it is a true and fair representation, when the leading part and\r\ncontrolling feature of the whole history is carefully suppressed?\r\n\r\nBut the mere leaving out is not the most remarkable feature of this most\r\nremarkable essay. His proposition is to establish that the leading men\r\nof the Revolution were for his great principle of nonintervention by the\r\ngovernment in the question of slavery in the Territories, while history\r\nshows that they decided, in the cases actually brought before them, in\r\nexactly the contrary way, and he knows it. Not only did they so decide\r\nat that time, but they stuck to it during sixty years, through thick and\r\nthin, as long as there was one of the Revolutionary heroes upon the stage\r\nof political action. Through their whole course, from first to last, they\r\nclung to freedom. And now he asks the community to believe that the men\r\nof the Revolution were in favor of his great principle, when we have the\r\nnaked history that they themselves dealt with this very subject matter\r\nof his principle, and utterly repudiated his principle, acting upon\r\na precisely contrary ground. It is as impudent and absurd as if a\r\nprosecuting attorney should stand up before a jury and ask them to convict\r\nA as the murderer of B, while B was walking alive before them.\r\n\r\nI say, again, if judge Douglas asserts that the men of the Revolution\r\nacted upon principles by which, to be consistent with themselves, they\r\nought to have adopted his popular sovereignty, then, upon a consideration\r\nof his own argument, he had a right to make you believe that they\r\nunderstood the principles of government, but misapplied them, that he\r\nhas arisen to enlighten the world as to the just application of this\r\nprinciple. He has a right to try to persuade you that he understands their\r\nprinciples better than they did, and, therefore, he will apply them now,\r\nnot as they did, but as they ought to have done. He has a right to go\r\nbefore the community and try to convince them of this, but he has no right\r\nto attempt to impose upon any one the belief that these men themselves\r\napproved of his great principle. There are two ways of establishing a\r\nproposition. One is by trying to demonstrate it upon reason, and the other\r\nis, to show that great men in former times have thought so and so, and\r\nthus to pass it by the weight of pure authority. Now, if Judge Douglas\r\nwill demonstrate somehow that this is popular sovereignty,--the right of\r\none man to make a slave of another, without any right in that other or\r\nany one else to object,--demonstrate it as Euclid demonstrated\r\npropositions,--there is no objection. But when he comes forward, seeking\r\nto carry a principle by bringing to it the authority of men who themselves\r\nutterly repudiate that principle, I ask that he shall not be permitted to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nI see, in the judge's speech here, a short sentence in these words: \"Our\r\nfathers, when they formed this government under which we live, understood\r\nthis question just as well, and even better than, we do now.\" That is\r\ntrue; I stick to that. I will stand by Judge Douglas in that to the bitter\r\nend. And now, Judge Douglas, come and stand by me, and truthfully show how\r\nthey acted, understanding it better than we do. All I ask of you, Judge\r\nDouglas, is to stick to the proposition that the men of the Revolution\r\nunderstood this subject better than we do now, and with that better\r\nunderstanding they acted better than you are trying to act now.\r\n\r\nI wish to say something now in regard to the Dred Scott decision, as dealt\r\nwith by Judge Douglas. In that \"memorable debate\" between Judge Douglas\r\nand myself, last year, the judge thought fit to commence a process of\r\ncatechising me, and at Freeport I answered his questions, and propounded\r\nsome to him. Among others propounded to him was one that I have here now.\r\nThe substance, as I remember it, is, \"Can the people of a United States\r\nTerritory, under the Dred Scott decision, in any lawful way, against the\r\nwish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits,\r\nprior to the formation of a State constitution?\" He answered that they\r\ncould lawfully exclude slavery from the United States Territories,\r\nnotwithstanding the Dred Scot decision. There was something about that\r\nanswer that has probably been a trouble to the judge ever since.\r\n\r\nThe Dred Scott decision expressly gives every citizen of the United States\r\na right to carry his slaves into the United States Territories. And now\r\nthere was some inconsistency in saying that the decision was right, and\r\nsaying, too, that the people of the Territory could lawfully drive slavery\r\nout again. When all the trash, the words, the collateral matter, was\r\ncleared away from it, all the chaff was fanned out of it, it was a bare\r\nabsurdity,--no less than that a thing may be lawfully driven away from\r\nwhere it has a lawful right to be. Clear it of all the verbiage, and\r\nthat is the naked truth of his proposition,--that a thing may be lawfully\r\ndriven from the place where it has a lawful right to stay. Well, it was\r\nbecause the judge could n't help seeing this that he has had so much\r\ntrouble with it; and what I want to ask your especial attention to, just\r\nnow, is to remind you, if you have not noticed the fact, that the judge\r\ndoes not any longer say that the people can exclude slavery. He does not\r\nsay so in the copyright essay; he did not say so in the speech that he\r\nmade here; and, so far as I know, since his re-election to the Senate he\r\nhas never said, as he did at Freeport, that the people of the Territories\r\ncan exclude slavery. He desires that you, who wish the Territories to\r\nremain free, should believe that he stands by that position; but he does\r\nnot say it himself. He escapes to some extent the absurd position I have\r\nstated, by changing his language entirely. What he says now is something\r\ndifferent in language, and we will consider whether it is not different\r\nin sense too. It is now that the Dred Scott decision, or rather the\r\nConstitution under that decision, does not carry slavery into the\r\nTerritories beyond the power of the people of the Territories to control\r\nit as other property. He does not say the people can drive it out, but\r\nthey can control it as other property. The language is different; we\r\nshould consider whether the sense is different. Driving a horse out of\r\nthis lot is too plain a proposition to be mistaken about; it is putting\r\nhim on the other side of the fence. Or it might be a sort of exclusion of\r\nhim from the lot if you were to kill him and let the worms devour him;\r\nbut neither of these things is the same as \"controlling him as other\r\nproperty.\" That would be to feed him, to pamper him, to ride him, to use\r\nand abuse him, to make the most money out of him, \"as other property\";\r\nbut, please you, what do the men who are in favor of slavery want more\r\nthan this? What do they really want, other than that slavery, being in the\r\nTerritories, shall be controlled as other property? If they want anything\r\nelse, I do not comprehend it. I ask your attention to this, first, for the\r\npurpose of pointing out the change of ground the judge has made; and, in\r\nthe second place, the importance of the change,--that that change is not\r\nsuch as to give you gentlemen who want his popular sovereignty the power\r\nto exclude the institution or drive it out at all. I know the judge\r\nsometimes squints at the argument that in controlling it as other property\r\nby unfriendly legislation they may control it to death; as you might, in\r\nthe case of a horse, perhaps, feed him so lightly and ride him so much\r\nthat he would die. But when you come to legislative control, there is\r\nsomething more to be attended to. I have no doubt, myself, that if the\r\nTerritories should undertake to control slave property as other property\r\nthat is, control it in such a way that it would be the most valuable as\r\nproperty, and make it bear its just proportion in the way of burdens\r\nas property, really deal with it as property,--the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States will say, \"God speed you, and amen.\" But I undertake to\r\ngive the opinion, at least, that if the Territories attempt by any direct\r\nlegislation to drive the man with his slave out of the Territory, or to\r\ndecide that his slave is free because of his being taken in there, or to\r\ntax him to such an extent that he cannot keep him there, the Supreme Court\r\nwill unhesitatingly decide all such legislation unconstitutional, as long\r\nas that Supreme Court is constructed as the Dred Scott Supreme Court is.\r\nThe first two things they have already decided, except that there is a\r\nlittle quibble among lawyers between the words \"dicta\" and \"decision.\"\r\nThey have already decided a negro cannot be made free by Territorial\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Dred Scott decision? Judge Douglas labors to show that it is\r\none thing, while I think it is altogether different. It is a long opinion,\r\nbut it is all embodied in this short statement: \"The Constitution of the\r\nUnited States forbids Congress to deprive a man of his property, without\r\ndue process of law; the right of property in slaves is distinctly and\r\nexpressly affirmed in that Constitution: therefore, if Congress shall\r\nundertake to say that a man's slave is no longer his slave when he crosses\r\na certain line into a Territory, that is depriving him of his property\r\nwithout due process of law, and is unconstitutional.\" There is the whole\r\nDred Scott decision. They add that if Congress cannot do so itself,\r\nCongress cannot confer any power to do so; and hence any effort by the\r\nTerritorial Legislature to do either of these things is absolutely decided\r\nagainst. It is a foregone conclusion by that court.\r\n\r\nNow, as to this indirect mode by \"unfriendly legislation,\" all lawyers\r\nhere will readily understand that such a proposition cannot be tolerated\r\nfor a moment, because a legislature cannot indirectly do that which it\r\ncannot accomplish directly. Then I say any legislation to control this\r\nproperty, as property, for its benefit as property, would be hailed by\r\nthis Dred Scott Supreme Court, and fully sustained; but any legislation\r\ndriving slave property out, or destroying it as property, directly or\r\nindirectly, will most assuredly, by that court, be held unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas says if the Constitution carries slavery into the\r\nTerritories, beyond the power of the people of the Territories to control\r\nit as other property; then it follows logically that every one who swears\r\nto support the Constitution of the United States must give that support\r\nto that property which it needs. And, if the Constitution carries slavery\r\ninto the Territories, beyond the power of the people, to control it as\r\nother property, then it also carries it into the States, because the\r\nConstitution is the supreme law of the land. Now, gentlemen, if it were\r\nnot for my excessive modesty, I would say that I told that very thing to\r\nJudge Douglas quite a year ago. This argument is here in print, and if it\r\nwere not for my modesty, as I said, I might call your attention to it. If\r\nyou read it, you will find that I not only made that argument, but made it\r\nbetter than he has made it since.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, this difference: I say now, and said then, there is no\r\nsort of question that the Supreme Court has decided that it is the right\r\nof the slave holder to take his slave and hold him in the Territory; and\r\nsaying this, judge Douglas himself admits the conclusion. He says if that\r\nis so, this consequence will follow; and because this consequence\r\nwould follow, his argument is, the decision cannot, therefore, be that\r\nway,--\"that would spoil my popular sovereignty; and it cannot be possible\r\nthat this great principle has been squelched out in this extraordinary\r\nway. It might be, if it were not for the extraordinary consequences of\r\nspoiling my humbug.\"\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the judge's argument about the Dred Scott case is,\r\nan effort to show that that decision deals altogether in declarations of\r\nnegatives; that the Constitution does not affirm anything as expounded\r\nby the Dred Scott decision, but it only declares a want of power a total\r\nabsence of power, in reference to the Territories. It seems to be his\r\npurpose to make the whole of that decision to result in a mere negative\r\ndeclaration of a want of power in Congress to do anything in relation to\r\nthis matter in the Territories. I know the opinion of the Judges states\r\nthat there is a total absence of power; but that is, unfortunately; not\r\nall it states: for the judges add that the right of property in a slave is\r\ndistinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution. It does not stop\r\nat saying that the right of property in a slave is recognized in the\r\nConstitution, is declared to exist somewhere in the Constitution, but says\r\nit is affirmed in the Constitution. Its language is equivalent to saying\r\nthat it is embodied and so woven in that instrument that it cannot be\r\ndetached without breaking the Constitution itself. In a word, it is part\r\nof the Constitution.\r\n\r\nDouglas is singularly unfortunate in his effort to make out that decision\r\nto be altogether negative, when the express language at the vital part is\r\nthat this is distinctly affirmed in the Constitution. I think myself, and\r\nI repeat it here, that this decision does not merely carry slavery into\r\nthe Territories, but by its logical conclusion it carries it into the\r\nStates in which we live. One provision of that Constitution is, that it\r\nshall be the supreme law of the land,--I do not quote the language,--any\r\nconstitution or law of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. This\r\nDred Scott decision says that the right of property in a slave is affirmed\r\nin that Constitution which is the supreme law of the land, any State\r\nconstitution or law notwithstanding. Then I say that to destroy a thing\r\nwhich is distinctly affirmed and supported by the supreme law of the land,\r\neven by a State constitution or law, is a violation of that supreme law,\r\nand there is no escape from it. In my judgment there is no avoiding that\r\nresult, save that the American people shall see that constitutions are\r\nbetter construed than our Constitution is construed in that decision. They\r\nmust take care that it is more faithfully and truly carried out than it is\r\nthere expounded.\r\n\r\nI must hasten to a conclusion. Near the beginning of my remarks I said\r\nthat this insidious Douglas popular sovereignty is the measure that now\r\nthreatens the purpose of the Republican party to prevent slavery from\r\nbeing nationalized in the United States. I propose to ask your attention\r\nfor a little while to some propositions in affirmance of that statement.\r\nTake it just as it stands, and apply it as a principle; extend and apply\r\nthat principle elsewhere; and consider where it will lead you. I now put\r\nthis proposition, that Judge Douglas's popular sovereignty applied will\r\nreopen the African slave trade; and I will demonstrate it by any variety\r\nof ways in which you can turn the subject or look at it.\r\n\r\nThe Judge says that the people of the Territories have the right, by his\r\nprinciple, to have slaves, if they want them. Then I say that the people\r\nin Georgia have the right to buy slaves in Africa, if they want them;\r\nand I defy any man on earth to show any distinction between the two\r\nthings,--to show that the one is either more wicked or more unlawful; to\r\nshow, on original principles, that one is better or worse than the other;\r\nor to show, by the Constitution, that one differs a whit from the other.\r\nHe will tell me, doubtless, that there is no constitutional provision\r\nagainst people taking slaves into the new Territories, and I tell him\r\nthat there is equally no constitutional provision against buying slaves\r\nin Africa. He will tell you that a people, in the exercise of popular\r\nsovereignty, ought to do as they please about that thing, and have slaves\r\nif they want them; and I tell you that the people of Georgia are as much\r\nentitled to popular sovereignty and to buy slaves in Africa, if they want\r\nthem, as the people of the Territory are to have slaves if they want them.\r\nI ask any man, dealing honestly with himself, to point out a distinction.\r\n\r\nI have recently seen a letter of Judge Douglas's in which, without stating\r\nthat to be the object, he doubtless endeavors to make a distinction\r\nbetween the two. He says he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of the\r\nlaws against the African slave trade. And why? He then seeks to give a\r\nreason that would not apply to his popular sovereignty in the Territories.\r\nWhat is that reason? \"The abolition of the African slave trade is a\r\ncompromise of the Constitution!\" I deny it. There is no truth in the\r\nproposition that the abolition of the African slave trade is a compromise\r\nof the Constitution. No man can put his finger on anything in the\r\nConstitution, or on the line of history, which shows it. It is a mere\r\nbarren assertion, made simply for the purpose of getting up a distinction\r\nbetween the revival of the African slave trade and his \"great principle.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time the Constitution of the United States was adopted, it was\r\nexpected that the slave trade would be abolished. I should assert and\r\ninsist upon that, if judge Douglas denied it. But I know that it was\r\nequally expected that slavery would be excluded from the Territories, and\r\nI can show by history that in regard to these two things public opinion\r\nwas exactly alike, while in regard to positive action, there was more done\r\nin the Ordinance of '87 to resist the spread of slavery than was ever done\r\nto abolish the foreign slave trade. Lest I be misunderstood, I say again\r\nthat at the time of the formation of the Constitution, public expectation\r\nwas that the slave trade would be abolished, but no more so than the\r\nspread of slavery in the Territories should be restrained. They stand\r\nalike, except that in the Ordinance of '87 there was a mark left by public\r\nopinion, showing that it was more committed against the spread of slavery\r\nin the Territories than against the foreign slave trade.\r\n\r\nCompromise! What word of compromise was there about it? Why, the public\r\nsense was then in favor of the abolition of the slave trade; but there was\r\nat the time a very great commercial interest involved in it, and extensive\r\ncapital in that branch of trade. There were doubtless the incipient stages\r\nof improvement in the South in the way of farming, dependent on the slave\r\ntrade, and they made a proposition to Congress to abolish the trade after\r\nallowing it twenty years,--a sufficient time for the capital and commerce\r\nengaged in it to be transferred to other channel. They made no provision\r\nthat it should be abolished in twenty years; I do not doubt that they\r\nexpected it would be, but they made no bargain about it. The public\r\nsentiment left no doubt in the minds of any that it would be done away.\r\nI repeat, there is nothing in the history of those times in favor of\r\nthat matter being a compromise of the constitution. It was the public\r\nexpectation at the time, manifested in a thousand ways, that the spread of\r\nslavery should also be restricted.\r\n\r\nThen I say, if this principle is established, that there is no wrong\r\nin slavery, and whoever wants it has a right to have it, is a matter\r\nof dollars and cents, a sort of question as to how they shall deal with\r\nbrutes, that between us and the negro here there is no sort of question,\r\nbut that at the South the question is between the negro and the crocodile,\r\nthat is all, it is a mere matter of policy, there is a perfect right,\r\naccording to interest, to do just as you please,--when this is done, where\r\nthis doctrine prevails, the miners and sappers will have formed public\r\nopinion for the slave trade. They will be ready for Jeff. Davis and\r\nStephens and other leaders of that company to sound the bugle for the\r\nrevival of the slave trade, for the second Dred Scott decision, for the\r\nflood of slavery to be poured over the free States, while we shall be here\r\ntied down and helpless and run over like sheep.\r\n\r\nIt is to be a part and parcel of this same idea to say to men who want to\r\nadhere to the Democratic party, who have always belonged to that\r\nparty, and are only looking about for some excuse to stick to it, but\r\nnevertheless hate slavery, that Douglas's popular sovereignty is as good\r\na way as any to oppose slavery. They allow themselves to be persuaded\r\neasily, in accordance with their previous dispositions, into this belief,\r\nthat it is about as good a way of opposing slavery as any, and we can do\r\nthat without straining our old party ties or breaking up old political\r\nassociations. We can do so without being called negro-worshipers. We\r\ncan do that without being subjected to the jibes and sneers that are so\r\nreadily thrown out in place of argument where no argument can be found.\r\nSo let us stick to this popular sovereignty,--this insidious popular\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nNow let me call your attention to one thing that has really happened,\r\nwhich shows this gradual and steady debauching of public opinion,\r\nthis course of preparation for the revival of the slave trade, for the\r\nTerritorial slave code, and the new Dred Scott decision that is to carry\r\nslavery into the Free States. Did you ever, five years ago, hear of\r\nanybody in the world saying that the negro had no share in the Declaration\r\nof National Independence; that it does not mean negroes at all; and when\r\n\"all men\" were spoken of, negroes were not included?\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that five years ago that proposition was not put upon paper\r\nby any living being anywhere. I have been unable at any time to find a man\r\nin an audience who would declare that he had ever known of anybody saying\r\nso five years ago. But last year there was not a Douglas popular sovereign\r\nin Illinois who did not say it. Is there one in Ohio but declares his firm\r\nbelief that the Declaration of Independence did not mean negroes at all? I\r\ndo not know how this is; I have not been here much; but I presume you are\r\nvery much alike everywhere. Then I suppose that all now express the belief\r\nthat the Declaration of Independence never did mean negroes. I call upon\r\none of them to say that he said it five years ago.\r\n\r\nIf you think that now, and did not think it then, the next thing that\r\nstrikes me is to remark that there has been a change wrought in you,--and\r\na very significant change it is, being no less than changing the negro,\r\nin your estimation, from the rank of a man to that of a brute. They\r\nare taking him down and placing him, when spoken of, among reptiles and\r\ncrocodiles, as Judge Douglas himself expresses it.\r\n\r\nIs not this change wrought in your minds a very important change? Public\r\nopinion in this country is everything. In a nation like ours, this popular\r\nsovereignty and squatter sovereignty have already wrought a change in the\r\npublic mind to the extent I have stated. There is no man in this crowd who\r\ncan contradict it.\r\n\r\nNow, if you are opposed to slavery honestly, as much as anybody, I ask you\r\nto note that fact, and the like of which is to follow, to be plastered on,\r\nlayer after layer, until very soon you are prepared to deal with the negro\r\nevery where as with the brute. If public sentiment has not been debauched\r\nalready to this point, a new turn of the screw in that direction is all\r\nthat is wanting; and this is constantly being done by the teachers of\r\nthis insidious popular sovereignty. You need but one or two turns further,\r\nuntil your minds, now ripening under these teachings, will be ready for\r\nall these things, and you will receive and support, or submit to, the\r\nslave trade, revived with all its horrors, a slave code enforced in our\r\nTerritories, and a new Dred Scott decision to bring slavery up into the\r\nvery heart of the free North. This, I must say, is but carrying out those\r\nwords prophetically spoken by Mr. Clay,--many, many years ago,--I believe\r\nmore than thirty years, when he told an audience that if they would\r\nrepress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation they must go\r\nback to the era of our independence, and muzzle the cannon which thundered\r\nits annual joyous return on the Fourth of July; they must blow out the\r\nmoral lights around us; they must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate\r\nthe love of liberty: but until they did these things, and others\r\neloquently enumerated by him, they could not repress all tendencies to\r\nultimate emancipation.\r\n\r\nI ask attention to the fact that in a pre-eminent degree these popular\r\nsovereigns are at this work: blowing out the moral lights around us;\r\nteaching that the negro is no longer a man, but a brute; that the\r\nDeclaration has nothing to do with him; that he ranks with the crocodile\r\nand the reptile; that man, with body and soul, is a matter of dollars and\r\ncents. I suggest to this portion of the Ohio Republicans, or Democrats, if\r\nthere be any present, the serious consideration of this fact that there\r\nis now going on among you a steady process of debauching public opinion on\r\nthis subject. With this, my friends, I bid you adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT CINCINNATI OHIO, SEPTEMBER 17, 1859\r\n\r\nMy Fellow-Citizens of the State of Ohio: This is the first time in my\r\nlife that I have appeared before an audience in so great a city as this:\r\nI therefore--though I am no longer a young man--make this appearance\r\nunder some degree of embarrassment. But I have found that when one is\r\nembarrassed, usually the shortest way to get through with it is to quit\r\ntalking or thinking about it, and go at something else.\r\n\r\nI understand that you have had recently with you my very distinguished\r\nfriend Judge Douglas, of Illinois; and I understand, without having had\r\nan opportunity (not greatly sought, to be sure) of seeing a report of the\r\nspeech that he made here, that he did me the honor to mention my humble\r\nname. I suppose that he did so for the purpose of making some objection to\r\nsome sentiment at some time expressed by me. I should expect, it is true,\r\nthat judge Douglas had reminded you, or informed you, if you had never\r\nbefore heard it, that I had once in my life declared it as my opinion that\r\nthis government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free; that\r\na house divided against itself cannot stand, and, as I had expressed it,\r\nI did not expect the house to fall, that I did not expect the Union to be\r\ndissolved, but that I did expect that it would cease to be divided, that\r\nit would become all one thing, or all the other; that either the opponents\r\nof slavery would arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the\r\npublic mind would rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction, or the friends of slavery will push it forward until it\r\nbecomes alike lawful in all the States, old or new, free as well as slave.\r\nI did, fifteen months ago, express that opinion, and upon many occasions\r\nJudge Douglas has denounced it, and has greatly, intentionally or\r\nunintentionally, misrepresented my purpose in the expression of that\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nI presume, without having seen a report of his speech, that he did\r\nso here. I presume that he alluded also to that opinion, in different\r\nlanguage, having been expressed at a subsequent time by Governor Seward of\r\nNew York, and that he took the two in a lump and denounced them; that he\r\ntried to point out that there was something couched in this opinion which\r\nled to the making of an entire uniformity of the local institutions of the\r\nvarious States of the Union, in utter disregard of the different States,\r\nwhich in their nature would seem to require a variety of institutions\r\nand a variety of laws, conforming to the differences in the nature of the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\nNot only so: I presume he insisted that this was a declaration of war\r\nbetween the free and slave States, that it was the sounding to the onset\r\nof continual war between the different States, the slave and free States.\r\n\r\nThis charge, in this form, was made by Judge Douglas on, I believe, the\r\n9th of July, 1858, in Chicago, in my hearing. On the next evening, I made\r\nsome reply to it. I informed him that many of the inferences he drew from\r\nthat expression of mine were altogether foreign to any purpose entertained\r\nby me, and in so far as he should ascribe these inferences to me, as my\r\npurpose, he was entirely mistaken; and in so far as he might argue that,\r\nwhatever might be my purpose, actions conforming to my views would lead\r\nto these results, he might argue and establish if he could; but, so far as\r\npurposes were concerned, he was totally mistaken as to me.\r\n\r\nWhen I made that reply to him, I told him, on the question of declaring\r\nwar between the different States of the Union, that I had not said that\r\nI did not expect any peace upon this question until slavery was\r\nexterminated; that I had only said I expected peace when that institution\r\nwas put where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in\r\ncourse of ultimate extinction; that I believed, from the organization of\r\nour government until a very recent period of time, the institution had\r\nbeen placed and continued upon such a basis; that we had had comparative\r\npeace upon that question through a portion of that period of time, only\r\nbecause the public mind rested in that belief in regard to it, and that\r\nwhen we returned to that position in relation to that matter, I supposed\r\nwe should again have peace as we previously had. I assured him, as I now,\r\nassure you, that I neither then had, nor have, or ever had, any purpose in\r\nany way of interfering with the institution of slavery, where it exists. I\r\nbelieve we have no power, under the Constitution of the United States, or\r\nrather under the form of government under which we live, to interfere with\r\nthe institution of slavery, or any other of the institutions of our\r\nsister States, be they free or slave States. I declared then, and I\r\nnow re-declare, that I have as little inclination to interfere with the\r\ninstitution of slavery where it now exists, through the instrumentality of\r\nthe General Government, or any other instrumentality, as I believe we have\r\nno power to do so. I accidentally used this expression: I had no purpose\r\nof entering into the slave States to disturb the institution of slavery.\r\nSo, upon the first occasion that Judge Douglas got an opportunity to reply\r\nto me, he passed by the whole body of what I had said upon that subject,\r\nand seized upon the particular expression of mine that I had no purpose of\r\nentering into the slave States to disturb the institution of slavery. \"Oh,\r\nno,\" said he, \"he [Lincoln] won't enter into the slave States to disturb\r\nthe institution of slavery, he is too prudent a man to do such a thing as\r\nthat; he only means that he will go on to the line between the free and\r\nslave States, and shoot over at them. This is all he means to do. He means\r\nto do them all the harm he can, to disturb them all he can, in such a way\r\nas to keep his own hide in perfect safety.\"\r\n\r\nWell, now, I did not think, at that time, that that was either a very\r\ndignified or very logical argument but so it was, I had to get along with\r\nit as well as I could.\r\n\r\nIt has occurred to-me here to-night that if I ever do shoot over the\r\nline at the people on the other side of the line into a slave State, and\r\npurpose to do so, keeping my skin safe, that I have now about the\r\nbest chance I shall ever have. I should not wonder if there are some\r\nKentuckians about this audience--we are close to Kentucky; and whether\r\nthat be so or not, we are on elevated ground, and, by speaking distinctly,\r\nI should not wonder if some of the Kentuckians would hear me on the other\r\nside of the river. For that reason I propose to address a portion of what\r\nI have to say to the Kentuckians.\r\n\r\nI say, then, in the first place, to the Kentuckians, that I am what they\r\ncall, as I understand it, a \"Black Republican.\" I think slavery is wrong,\r\nmorally and politically. I desire that it should be no further spread\r\nin--these United States, and I should not object if it should gradually\r\nterminate in the whole Union. While I say this for myself, I say to you\r\nKentuckians that I understand you differ radically with me upon this\r\nproposition; that you believe slavery is a good thing; that slavery is\r\nright; that it ought to be extended and perpetuated in this Union.\r\nNow, there being this broad difference between us, I do not pretend, in\r\naddressing myself to you Kentuckians, to attempt proselyting you; that\r\nwould be a vain effort. I do not enter upon it. I only propose to try\r\nto show you that you ought to nominate for the next Presidency, at\r\nCharleston, my distinguished friend Judge Douglas. In all that there is a\r\ndifference between you and him, I understand he is sincerely for you, and\r\nmore wisely for you than you are for yourselves. I will try to demonstrate\r\nthat proposition. Understand, now, I say that I believe he is as sincerely\r\nfor you, and more wisely for you, than you are for yourselves.\r\n\r\nWhat do you want more than anything else to make successful your views of\r\nslavery,--to advance the outspread of it, and to secure and perpetuate\r\nthe nationality of it? What do you want more than anything else? What--is\r\nneeded absolutely? What is indispensable to you? Why, if I may, be allowed\r\nto answer the question, it is to retain a hold upon the North, it is to\r\nretain support and strength from the free States. If you can get this\r\nsupport and strength from the free States, you can succeed. If you do not\r\nget this support and this strength from the free States, you are in the\r\nminority, and you are beaten at once.\r\n\r\nIf that proposition be admitted,--and it is undeniable,--then the next\r\nthing I say to you is, that Douglas, of all the men in this nation, is the\r\nonly man that affords you any hold upon the free States; that no other man\r\ncan give you any strength in the free States. This being so, if you doubt\r\nthe other branch of the proposition, whether he is for you--whether he is\r\nreally for you, as I have expressed it,--I propose asking your attention\r\nfor a while to a few facts.\r\n\r\nThe issue between you and me, understand, is, that I think slavery is\r\nwrong, and ought not to be outspread; and you think it is right, and\r\nought to be extended and perpetuated. [A voice, \"Oh, Lord!\"] That is my\r\nKentuckian I am talking to now.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to try to show you that Douglas is as sincerely for you and\r\nmore wisely for you than you are for yourselves.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we know that in a government like this, in a\r\ngovernment of the people, where the voice of all the men of the country,\r\nsubstantially, enters into the execution--or administration, rather--of\r\nthe government, in such a government, what lies at the bottom of all of it\r\nis public opinion. I lay down the proposition, that Judge Douglas is\r\nnot only the man that promises you in advance a hold upon the North, and\r\nsupport in the North, but he constantly moulds public opinion to your\r\nends; that in every possible way he can he constantly moulds the public\r\nopinion of the North to your ends; and if there are a few things in which\r\nhe seems to be against you,--a few things which he says that appear to\r\nbe against you, and a few that he forbears to say which you would like\r\nto have him say you ought to remember that the saying of the one, or the\r\nforbearing to say the other, would lose his hold upon the North, and, by\r\nconsequence, would lose his capacity to serve you.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject of moulding public opinion I call your attention to the\r\nfact--for a well established fact it is--that the Judge never says your\r\ninstitution of slavery is wrong. There is not a public man in the United\r\nStates, I believe, with the exception of Senator Douglas, who has not, at\r\nsome time in his life, declared his opinion whether the thing is right or\r\nwrong; but Senator Douglas never declares it is wrong. He leaves himself\r\nat perfect liberty to do all in your favor which he would be hindered from\r\ndoing if he were to declare the thing to be wrong. On the contrary, he\r\ntakes all the chances that he has for inveigling the sentiment of the\r\nNorth, opposed to slavery, into your support, by never saying it is right.\r\nThis you ought to set down to his credit: You ought to give him full\r\ncredit for this much; little though it be, in comparison to the whole\r\nwhich he does for you.\r\n\r\nSome other, things I will ask your attention to. He said upon the floor of\r\nthe United States Senate, and he has repeated it, as I understand, a great\r\nmany times, that he does not care whether slavery is \"voted up or voted\r\ndown.\" This again shows you, or ought to show you, if you would reason\r\nupon it, that he does not believe it to be wrong; for a man may say when\r\nhe sees nothing wrong in a thing; that he, dues not care whether it be\r\nvoted up or voted down but no man can logically say that he cares not\r\nwhether a thing goes up or goes down which to him appears to be wrong. You\r\ntherefore have a demonstration in this that to Judge Douglas's mind your\r\nfavorite institution, which you would have spread out and made perpetual,\r\nis no wrong.\r\n\r\nAnother thing he tells you, in a speech made at Memphis in Tennessee,\r\nshortly after the canvass in Illinois, last year. He there distinctly\r\ntold the people that there was a \"line drawn by the Almighty across this\r\ncontinent, on the one side of which the soil must always be cultivated by\r\nslaves\"; that he did not pretend to know exactly where that line was,\r\nbut that there was such a line. I want to ask your attention to that\r\nproposition again; that there is one portion of this continent where the\r\nAlmighty has signed the soil shall always be cultivated by slaves; that\r\nits being cultivated by slaves at that place is right; that it has the\r\ndirect sympathy and authority of the Almighty. Whenever you can get these\r\nNorthern audiences to adopt the opinion that slavery is right on the other\r\nside of the Ohio, whenever you can get them, in pursuance of Douglas's\r\nviews, to adopt that sentiment, they will very readily make the other\r\nargument, which is perfectly logical, that that which is right on that\r\nside of the Ohio cannot be wrong on this, and that if you have that\r\nproperty on that side of the Ohio, under the seal and stamp of the\r\nAlmighty, when by any means it escapes over here it is wrong to have\r\nconstitutions and laws \"to devil\" you about it. So Douglas is moulding the\r\npublic opinion of the North, first to say that the thing is right in your\r\nState over the Ohio River, and hence to say that that which is right there\r\nis not wrong here, and that all laws and constitutions here recognizing\r\nit as being wrong are themselves wrong, and ought to be repealed and\r\nabrogated. He will tell you, men of Ohio, that if you choose here to have\r\nlaws against slavery, it is in conformity to the idea that your climate\r\nis not suited to it, that your climate is not suited to slave labor, and\r\ntherefore you have constitutions and laws against it.\r\n\r\nLet us attend to that argument for a little while and see if it be sound.\r\nYou do not raise sugar-cane (except the new-fashioned sugar-cane, and you\r\nwon't raise that long), but they do raise it in Louisiana. You don't raise\r\nit in Ohio, because you can't raise it profitably, because the climate\r\ndon't suit it. They do raise it in Louisiana, because there it is\r\nprofitable. Now, Douglas will tell you that is precisely the slavery\r\nquestion: that they do have slaves there because they are profitable, and\r\nyou don't have them here because they are not profitable. If that is so,\r\nthen it leads to dealing with the one precisely as with the other. Is\r\nthere, then, anything in the constitution or laws of Ohio against raising\r\nsugar-cane? Have you found it necessary to put any such provision in your\r\nlaw? Surely not! No man desires to raise sugar-cane in Ohio, but if\r\nany man did desire to do so, you would say it was a tyrannical law that\r\nforbids his doing so; and whenever you shall agree with Douglas, whenever\r\nyour minds are brought to adopt his argument, as surely you will have\r\nreached the conclusion that although it is not profitable in Ohio, if any\r\nman wants it, is wrong to him not to let him have it.\r\n\r\nIn this matter Judge Douglas is preparing the public mind for you of\r\nKentucky to make perpetual that good thing in your estimation, about which\r\nyou and I differ.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, let me ask your attention to another thing. I believe\r\nit is safe to assert that five years ago no living man had expressed the\r\nopinion that the negro had no share in the Declaration of Independence.\r\nLet me state that again: five years ago no living man had expressed the\r\nopinion that the negro had no share in the Declaration of Independence.\r\nIf there is in this large audience any man who ever knew of that opinion\r\nbeing put upon paper as much as five years ago, I will be obliged to him\r\nnow or at a subsequent time to show it.\r\n\r\nIf that be true I wish you then to note the next fact: that within the\r\nspace of five years Senator Douglas, in the argument of this question, has\r\ngot his entire party, so far as I know, without exception, in saying that\r\nthe negro has no share in the Declaration of Independence. If there be now\r\nin all these United States one Douglas man that does not say this, I have\r\nbeen unable upon any occasion to scare him up. Now, if none of you said\r\nthis five years ago, and all of you say it now, that is a matter that you\r\nKentuckians ought to note. That is a vast change in the Northern public\r\nsentiment upon that question.\r\n\r\nOf what tendency is that change? The tendency of that change is to bring\r\nthe public mind to the conclusion that when men are spoken of, the\r\nnegro is not meant; that when negroes are spoken of, brutes alone are\r\ncontemplated. That change in public sentiment has already degraded\r\nthe black man in the estimation of Douglas and his followers from the\r\ncondition of a man of some sort, and assigned him to the condition of a\r\nbrute. Now, you Kentuckians ought to give Douglas credit for this. That is\r\nthe largest possible stride that can be made in regard to the perpetuation\r\nof your thing of slavery.\r\n\r\nA voice: Speak to Ohio men, and not to Kentuckians!\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN: I beg permission to speak as I please.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky perhaps, in many of the slave States certainly, you are trying\r\nto establish the rightfulness of slavery by reference to the Bible. You\r\nare trying to show that slavery existed in the Bible times by divine\r\nordinance. Now, Douglas is wiser than you, for your own benefit, upon that\r\nsubject. Douglas knows that whenever you establish that slavery was--right\r\nby the Bible, it will occur that that slavery was the slavery of the white\r\nman, of men without reference to color; and he knows very well that you\r\nmay entertain that idea in Kentucky as much as you please, but you will\r\nnever win any Northern support upon it. He makes a wiser argument for you:\r\nhe makes the argument that the slavery of the black man; the slavery of\r\nthe man who has a skin of a different color from your own, is right. He\r\nthereby brings to your support Northern voters who could not for a moment\r\nbe brought by your own argument of the Bible right of slavery. Will you\r\ngive him credit for that? Will you not say that in this matter he is more\r\nwisely for you than you are for yourselves?\r\n\r\nNow, having established with his entire party this doctrine, having been\r\nentirely successful in that branch of his efforts in your behalf, he is\r\nready for another.\r\n\r\nAt this same meeting at Memphis he declared that in all contests between\r\nthe negro and the white man he was for the white man, but that in all\r\nquestions between the negro and the crocodile he was for the negro. He did\r\nnot make that declaration accidentally at Memphis. He made it a great many\r\ntimes in the canvass in Illinois last year (though I don't know that it\r\nwas reported in any of his speeches there, but he frequently made it). I\r\nbelieve he repeated it at Columbus, and I should not wonder if he repeated\r\nit here. It is, then, a deliberate way of expressing himself upon that\r\nsubject. It is a matter of mature deliberation with him thus to express\r\nhimself upon that point of his case. It therefore requires deliberate\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe first inference seems to be that if you do not enslave the negro,\r\nyou are wronging the white man in some way or other, and that whoever is\r\nopposed to the negro being enslaved, is, in some way or other, against\r\nthe white man. Is not that a falsehood? If there was a necessary conflict\r\nbetween the white man and the negro, I should be for the white man as much\r\nas Judge Douglas; but I say there is no such necessary conflict. I say\r\nthat there is room enough for us all to be free, and that it not only does\r\nnot wrong the white man that the negro should be free, but it positively\r\nwrongs the mass of the white men that the negro should be enslaved; that\r\nthe mass of white men are really injured by the effects of slave labor in\r\nthe vicinity of the fields of their own labor.\r\n\r\nBut I do not desire to dwell upon this branch of the question more than to\r\nsay that this assumption of his is false, and I do hope that that fallacy\r\nwill not long prevail in the minds of intelligent white men. At all\r\nevents, you ought to thank Judge Douglas for it; it is for your benefit it\r\nis made.\r\n\r\nThe other branch of it is, that in the struggle between the negro and\r\nthe crocodile; he is for the negro. Well, I don't know that there is any\r\nstruggle between the negro and the crocodile, either. I suppose that if a\r\ncrocodile (or, as we old Ohio River boatmen used to call them, alligators)\r\nshould come across a white man, he would kill him if he could; and so he\r\nwould a negro. But what, at last, is this proposition? I believe it is a\r\nsort of proposition in proportion, which may be stated thus: \"As the negro\r\nis to the white man, so is the crocodile to the negro; and as the negro\r\nmay rightfully treat the crocodile as a beast or reptile, so the white man\r\nmay rightfully treat the negro as a beast or a reptile.\" That is really\r\nthe \"knip\" of all that argument of his.\r\n\r\nNow, my brother Kentuckians, who believe in this, you ought to thank\r\nJudge Douglas for having put that in a much more taking way than any of\r\nyourselves have done.\r\n\r\nAgain, Douglas's great principle, \"popular sovereignty,\" as he calls it,\r\ngives you, by natural consequence, the revival of the slave trade whenever\r\nyou want it. If you question this, listen awhile, consider awhile what I\r\nshall advance in support of that proposition.\r\n\r\nHe says that it is the sacred right of the man who goes into the\r\nTerritories to have slavery if he wants it. Grant that for argument's\r\nsake. Is it not the sacred right of the man who don't go there equally to\r\nbuy slaves in Africa, if he wants them? Can you point out the difference?\r\nThe man who goes into the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska, or any other\r\nnew Territory, with the sacred right of taking a slave there which belongs\r\nto him, would certainly have no more right to take one there than I would,\r\nwho own no slave, but who would desire to buy one and take him there. You\r\nwill not say you, the friends of Judge Douglas but that the man who\r\ndoes not own a slave has an equal right to buy one and take him to the\r\nTerritory as the other does.\r\n\r\nA voice: I want to ask a question. Don't foreign nations interfere with\r\nthe slave trade?\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN: Well! I understand it to be a principle of Democracy to whip\r\nforeign nations whenever, they interfere with us.\r\n\r\nVoice: I only asked for information. I am a Republican myself.\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN: You and I will be on the best terms in the world, but I do\r\nnot wish to be diverted from the point I was trying to press.\r\n\r\nI say that Douglas's popular sovereignty, establishing his sacred right\r\nin the people, if you please, if carried to its logical conclusion gives\r\nequally the sacred right to the people of the States or the Territories\r\nthemselves to buy slaves wherever they can buy them cheapest; and if any\r\nman can show a distinction, I should like to hear him try it. If any man\r\ncan show how the people of Kansas have a better right to slaves, because\r\nthey want them, than the people of Georgia have to buy them in Africa,\r\nI want him to do it. I think it cannot be done. If it is \"popular\r\nsovereignty\" for the people to have slaves because they want them, it is\r\npopular sovereignty for them to buy them in Africa because they desire to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nI know that Douglas has recently made a little effort, not seeming to\r\nnotice that he had a different theory, has made an effort to get rid\r\nof that. He has written a letter, addressed to somebody, I believe, who\r\nresides in Iowa, declaring his opposition to the repeal of the laws that\r\nprohibit the Africa slave trade. He bases his opposition to such repeal\r\nupon the ground that these laws are themselves one of the compromises of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States. Now, it would be very interesting\r\nto see Judge Douglas or any of his friends turn, to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States and point out that compromise, to show where there is\r\nany compromise in the Constitution, or provision in the Constitution;\r\nexpress or implied, by which the administrators of that Constitution are\r\nunder any obligation to repeal the African slave trade. I know, or at\r\nleast I think I know, that the framers of that Constitution did expect\r\nthe African slave trade would be abolished at the end of twenty years, to\r\nwhich time their prohibition against its being abolished extended there\r\nis abundant contemporaneous history to show that the framers of the\r\nConstitution expected it to be abolished. But while they so expected,\r\nthey gave nothing for that expectation, and they put no provision in\r\nthe Constitution requiring it should be so abolished. The migration or\r\nimportation of such persons as the States shall see fit to admit shall not\r\nbe prohibited, but a certain tax might be levied upon such importation.\r\nBut what was to be done after that time? The Constitution is as silent\r\nabout that as it is silent, personally, about myself. There is absolutely\r\nnothing in it about that subject; there is only the expectation of the\r\nframers of the Constitution that the slave trade would be abolished at the\r\nend of that time; and they expected it would be abolished, owing to public\r\nsentiment, before that time; and the put that provision in, in order that\r\nit should not be abolished before that time, for reasons which I suppose\r\nthey thought to be sound ones, but which I will not now try to enumerate\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nBut while, they expected the slave trade would be abolished at that time,\r\nthey expected that the spread of slavery into the new Territories should\r\nalso be restricted. It is as easy to prove that the framers of the\r\nConstitution of the United States expected that slavery should be\r\nprohibited from extending into the new Territories, as it is to prove\r\nthat it was expected that the slave trade should be abolished. Both these\r\nthings were expected. One was no more expected than the other, and one was\r\nno more a compromise of the Constitution than the other. There was nothing\r\nsaid in the Constitution in regard to the spread of slavery into the\r\nTerritory. I grant that; but there was something very important said about\r\nit by the same generation of men in the adoption of the old Ordinance of\r\n'87, through the influence of which you here in Ohio, our neighbors in\r\nIndiana, we in Illinois, our neighbors in Michigan and Wisconsin, are\r\nhappy, prosperous, teeming millions of free men. That generation of men,\r\nthough not to the full extent members of the convention that framed the\r\nConstitution, were to some extent members of that convention, holding\r\nseats at the same time in one body and the other, so that if there was any\r\ncompromise on either of these subjects, the strong evidence is that\r\nthat compromise was in favor of the restriction of slavery from the new\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nBut Douglas says that he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of those\r\nlaws because, in his view, it is a compromise of the Constitution. You\r\nKentuckians, no doubt, are somewhat offended with that. You ought not to\r\nbe! You ought to be patient! You ought to know that if he said less than\r\nthat, he would lose the power of \"lugging\" the Northern States to your\r\nsupport. Really, what you would push him to do would take from him\r\nhis entire power to serve you. And you ought to remember how long, by\r\nprecedent, Judge Douglas holds himself obliged to stick by compromises.\r\nYou ought to remember that by the time you yourselves think you are ready\r\nto inaugurate measures for the revival of the African slave trade, that\r\nsufficient time will have arrived, by precedent, for Judge Douglas to\r\nbreak through, that compromise. He says now nothing more strong than\r\nhe said in 1849 when he declared in favor of Missouri Compromise,--and\r\nprecisely four years and a quarter after he declared that Compromise to\r\nbe a sacred thing, which \"no ruthless hand would ever daze to touch,\" he\r\nhimself brought forward the measure ruthlessly to destroy it. By a mere\r\ncalculation of time it will only be four years more until he is ready to\r\ntake back his profession about the sacredness of the Compromise abolishing\r\nthe slave trade. Precisely as soon as you are ready to have his services\r\nin that direction, by fair calculation, you may be sure of having them.\r\n\r\nBut you remember and set down to Judge Douglas's debt, or discredit, that\r\nhe, last year, said the people of Territories can, in spite of the Dred\r\nScott decision, exclude your slaves from those Territories; that he\r\ndeclared, by \"unfriendly legislation\" the extension of your property into\r\nthe new Territories may be cut off, in the teeth of the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nHe assumed that position at Freeport on the 27th of August, 1858. He said\r\nthat the people of the Territories can exclude slavery, in so many words:\r\nYou ought, however, to bear in mind that he has never said it since. You\r\nmay hunt in every speech that he has since made, and he has never used\r\nthat expression once. He has never seemed to notice that he is stating his\r\nviews differently from what he did then; but by some sort of accident, he\r\nhas always really stated it differently. He has always since then declared\r\nthat \"the Constitution does not carry slavery into the Territories of the\r\nUnited States beyond the power of the people legally to control it, as\r\nother property.\" Now, there is a difference in the language used upon\r\nthat former occasion and in this latter day. There may or may not be a\r\ndifference in the meaning, but it is worth while considering whether there\r\nis not also a difference in meaning.\r\n\r\nWhat is it to exclude? Why, it is to drive it out. It is in some way to\r\nput it out of the Territory. It is to force it across the line, or change\r\nits character so that, as property, it is out of existence. But what is\r\nthe controlling of it \"as other property\"? Is controlling it as other\r\nproperty the same thing as destroying it, or driving it away? I should\r\nthink not. I should think the controlling of it as other property would be\r\njust about what you in Kentucky should want. I understand the controlling\r\nof property means the controlling of it for the benefit of the owner of\r\nit. While I have no doubt the Supreme Court of the United States would\r\nsay \"God speed\" to any of the Territorial Legislatures that should thus\r\ncontrol slave property, they would sing quite a different tune if, by\r\nthe pretence of controlling it, they were to undertake to pass laws which\r\nvirtually excluded it,--and that upon a very well known principle to\r\nall lawyers, that what a Legislature cannot directly do, it cannot do by\r\nindirection; that as the Legislature has not the power to drive slaves\r\nout, they have no power, by indirection, by tax, or by imposing burdens in\r\nany way on that property, to effect the same end, and that any attempt to\r\ndo so would be held by the Dred Scott court unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nDouglas is not willing to stand by his first proposition that they can\r\nexclude it, because we have seen that that proposition amounts to nothing\r\nmore nor less than the naked absurdity that you may lawfully drive out\r\nthat which has a lawful right to remain. He admitted at first that the\r\nslave might be lawfully taken into the Territories under the Constitution\r\nof the United States, and yet asserted that he might be lawfully driven\r\nout. That being the proposition, it is the absurdity I have stated. He\r\nis not willing to stand in the face of that direct, naked, and impudent\r\nabsurdity; he has, therefore, modified his language into that of being\r\n\"controlled as other property.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kentuckians don't like this in Douglas! I will tell you where it will\r\ngo. He now swears by the court. He was once a leading man in Illinois to\r\nbreak down a court, because it had made a decision he did not like. But\r\nhe now not only swears by the court, the courts having got to working\r\nfor you, but he denounces all men that do not swear by the courts,\r\nas unpatriotic, as bad citizens. When one of these acts of unfriendly\r\nlegislation shall impose such heavy burdens as to, in effect, destroy\r\nproperty in slaves in a Territory, and show plainly enough that there\r\ncan be no mistake in the purpose of the Legislature to make them\r\nso burdensome, this same Supreme Court will decide that law to be\r\nunconstitutional, and he will be ready to say for your benefit \"I swear by\r\nthe court; I give it up\"; and while that is going on he has been getting\r\nall his men to swear by the courts, and to give it up with him. In this\r\nagain he serves you faithfully, and, as I say, more wisely than you serve\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\nAgain: I have alluded in the beginning of these remarks to the fact that\r\nJudge Douglas has made great complaint of my having expressed the opinion\r\nthat this government \"cannot endure permanently, half slave and half\r\nfree.\" He has complained of Seward for using different language, and\r\ndeclaring that there is an \"irrepressible conflict\" between the principles\r\nof free and slave labor. [A voice: \"He says it is not original with\r\nSeward. That it is original with Lincoln.\"] I will attend to that\r\nimmediately, sir. Since that time, Hickman of Pennsylvania expressed the\r\nsame sentiment. He has never denounced Mr. Hickman: why? There is a little\r\nchance, notwithstanding that opinion in the mouth of Hickman, that he may\r\nyet be a Douglas man. That is the difference! It is not unpatriotic to\r\nhold that opinion if a man is a Douglas man.\r\n\r\nBut neither I, nor Seward, nor Hickman is entitled to the enviable or\r\nunenviable distinction of having first expressed that idea. That same idea\r\nwas expressed by the Richmond Enquirer, in Virginia, in 1856,--quite two\r\nyears before it was expressed by the first of us. And while Douglas was\r\npluming himself that in his conflict with my humble self, last year, he\r\nhad \"squelched out\" that fatal heresy, as he delighted to call it, and\r\nhad suggested that if he only had had a chance to be in New York and meet\r\nSeward he would have \"squelched\" it there also, it never occurred to him\r\nto breathe a word against Pryor. I don't think that you can discover that\r\nDouglas ever talked of going to Virginia to \"squelch\" out that idea there.\r\nNo. More than that. That same Roger A. Pryor was brought to Washington\r\nCity and made the editor of the par excellence Douglas paper, after making\r\nuse of that expression, which, in us, is so unpatriotic and heretical.\r\nFrom all this, my Kentucky friends may see that this opinion is heretical\r\nin his view only when it is expressed by men suspected of a desire that\r\nthe country shall all become free, and not when expressed by those fairly\r\nknown to entertain the desire that the whole country shall become slave.\r\nWhen expressed by that class of men, it is in nowise offensive to him. In\r\nthis again, my friends of Kentucky, you have Judge Douglas with you.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason why you Southern people ought to nominate Douglas\r\nat your convention at Charleston. That reason is the wonderful capacity of\r\nthe man,--the power he has of doing what would seem to be impossible. Let\r\nme call your attention to one of these apparently impossible things:\r\n\r\nDouglas had three or four very distinguished men of the most extreme\r\nanti-slavery views of any men in the Republican party expressing their\r\ndesire for his re-election to the Senate last year. That would, of itself,\r\nhave seemed to be a little wonderful; but that wonder is heightened when\r\nwe see that Wise of Virginia, a man exactly opposed to them, a man who\r\nbelieves in the divine right of slavery, was also expressing his desire\r\nthat Douglas should be reelected; that another man that may be said to\r\nbe kindred to Wise, Mr. Breckinridge, the Vice-President, and of your\r\nown State, was also agreeing with the anti-slavery men in the North that\r\nDouglas ought to be re-elected. Still to heighten the wonder, a senator\r\nfrom Kentucky, whom I have always loved with an affection as tender\r\nand endearing as I have ever loved any man, who was opposed to the\r\nanti-slavery men for reasons which seemed sufficient to him, and equally\r\nopposed to Wise and Breckinridge, was writing letters into Illinois to\r\nsecure the reelection of Douglas. Now, that all these conflicting elements\r\nshould be brought, while at daggers' points with one another, to support\r\nhim, is a feat that is worthy for you to note and consider. It is quite\r\nprobable that each of these classes of men thought, by the re-election of\r\nDouglas, their peculiar views would gain something: it is probable that\r\nthe anti-slavery men thought their views would gain something; that Wise\r\nand Breckinridge thought so too, as regards their opinions; that Mr.\r\nCrittenden thought that his views would gain something, although he was\r\nopposed to both these other men. It is probable that each and all of them\r\nthought that they were using Douglas; and it is yet an unsolved problem\r\nwhether he was not using them all. If he was, then it is for you to\r\nconsider whether that power to perform wonders is one for you lightly to\r\nthrow away.\r\n\r\nThere is one other thing that I will say to you, in this relation. It is\r\nbut my opinion, I give it to you without a fee. It is my opinion that it\r\nis for you to take him or be defeated; and that if you do take him you\r\nmay be beaten. You will surely be beaten if you do not take him. We, the\r\nRepublicans and others forming the opposition of the country, intend to\r\n\"stand by our guns,\" to be patient and firm, and in the long run to beat\r\nyou, whether you take him or not. We know that before we fairly beat\r\nyou we have to beat you both together. We know that you are \"all of a\r\nfeather,\" and that we have to beat you all together, and we expect to\r\ndo it. We don't intend to be very impatient about it. We mean to be as\r\ndeliberate and calm about it as it is possible to be, but as firm and\r\nresolved as it is possible for men to be. When we do as we say,--beat\r\nyou,--you perhaps want to know what we will do with you.\r\n\r\nI will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the opposition,\r\nwhat we mean to do with you. We mean to treat you, as near as we possibly\r\ncan, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison treated you. We mean to leave\r\nyou alone, and in no way interfere with your institution; to abide by all\r\nand every compromise of the Constitution, and, in a word, coming back to\r\nthe original proposition, to treat you, so far as degenerated men (if we\r\nhave degenerated) may, according to the examples of those noble fathers,\r\nWashington, Jefferson, and Madison. We mean to remember that you are\r\nas good as we; that there is no difference between us other than the\r\ndifference of circumstances. We mean to recognize and bear in mind always\r\nthat you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as we\r\nclaim to have, and treat you accordingly. We mean to marry your girls when\r\nwe have a chance, the white ones I mean; and I have the honor to inform\r\nyou that I once did have a chance in that way.\r\n\r\nI have told you what we mean to do. I want to know, now, when that thing\r\ntakes place, what do you mean to do? I often hear it intimated that you\r\nmean to divide the Union whenever a Republican, or anything like it, is\r\nelected President of the United States. [A voice: \"That is so.\"] \"That is\r\nso,\" one of them says; I wonder if he is a Kentuckian? [A voice: \"He is\r\na Douglas man.\"] Well, then, I want to know what you are going to do with\r\nyour half of it? Are you going to split the Ohio down through, and push\r\nyour half off a piece? Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us\r\noutrageous fellows? Or are you going to build up a wall some way between\r\nyour country and ours, by which that movable property of yours can't come\r\nover here any more, to the danger of your losing it? Do you think you can\r\nbetter yourselves, on that subject, by leaving us here under no obligation\r\nwhatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come\r\nhither? You have divided the Union because we would not do right with you,\r\nas you think, upon that subject; when we cease to be under obligations to\r\ndo anything for you, how much better off do you think you will be? Will\r\nyou make war upon us and kill us all? Why, gentlemen, I think you are as\r\ngallant and as brave men as live; that you can fight as bravely in a\r\ngood cause, man for man, as any other people living; that you have shown\r\nyourselves capable of this upon various occasions: but, man for man, you\r\nare not better than we are, and there are not so many of you as there are\r\nof us. You will never make much of a hand at whipping us. If we were fewer\r\nin numbers than you, I think that you could whip us; if we were equal, it\r\nwould likely be a drawn battle; but being inferior in numbers, you will\r\nmake nothing by attempting to master us.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps I have addressed myself as long, or longer, to the Kentuckians\r\nthan I ought to have done, inasmuch as I have said that whatever course\r\nyou take we intend in the end to beat you. I propose to address a few\r\nremarks to our friends, by way of discussing with them the best means of\r\nkeeping that promise that I have in good faith made.\r\n\r\nIt may appear a little episodical for me to mention the topic of which\r\nI will speak now. It is a favorite position of Douglas's that the\r\ninterference of the General Government, through the Ordinance of '87, or\r\nthrough any other act of the General Government never has made or ever can\r\nmake a free State; the Ordinance of '87 did not make free States of\r\nOhio, Indiana, or Illinois; that these States are free upon his \"great\r\nprinciple\" of popular sovereignty, because the people of those several\r\nStates have chosen to make them so. At Columbus, and probably here, he\r\nundertook to compliment the people that they themselves have made the\r\nState of Ohio free, and that the Ordinance of '87 was not entitled in any\r\ndegree to divide the honor with them. I have no doubt that the people\r\nof the State of Ohio did make her free according to their own will and\r\njudgment, but let the facts be remembered.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, I believe, it was you who made your first constitution, with\r\nthe clause prohibiting slavery, and you did it, I suppose, very nearly\r\nunanimously; but you should bear in mind that you--speaking of you as\r\none people--that you did so unembarrassed by the actual presence of\r\nthe institution amongst you; that you made it a free State not with the\r\nembarrassment upon you of already having among you many slaves, which if\r\nthey had been here, and you had sought to make a free State, you would\r\nnot know what to do with. If they had been among you, embarrassing\r\ndifficulties, most probably, would have induced you to tolerate a slave\r\nconstitution instead of a free one, as indeed these very difficulties have\r\nconstrained every people on this continent who have adopted slavery.\r\n\r\nPray what was it that made you free? What kept you free? Did you not\r\nfind your country free when you came to decide that Ohio should be a free\r\nState? It is important to inquire by what reason you found it so. Let us\r\ntake an illustration between the States of Ohio and Kentucky. Kentucky is\r\nseparated by this River Ohio, not a mile wide. A portion of Kentucky, by\r\nreason of the course of the Ohio, is farther north than this portion of\r\nOhio, in which we now stand. Kentucky is entirely covered with slavery;\r\nOhio is entirely free from it: What made that difference? Was it climate?\r\nNo. A portion of Kentucky was farther north than this portion of Ohio.\r\nWas it soil? No. There is nothing in the soil of the one more favorable\r\nto slave than the other. It was not climate or soil that mused one side of\r\nthe line to be entirely covered with slavery, and the other side free of\r\nit. What was it? Study over it. Tell us, if you can, in all the range\r\nof conjecture, if there be anything you can conceive of that made that\r\ndifference, other than that there was no law of any sort keeping it out of\r\nKentucky, while the Ordinance of '87 kept it out of Ohio. If there is any\r\nother reason than this, I confess that it is wholly beyond my power to\r\nconceive of it. This, then, I offer to combat the idea that that Ordinance\r\nhas never made any State free.\r\n\r\nI don't stop at this illustration. I come to the State of Indiana; and\r\nwhat I have said as between Kentucky and Ohio, I repeat as between\r\nIndiana and Kentucky: it is equally applicable. One additional argument\r\nis applicable also to Indiana. In her Territorial condition she more than\r\nonce petitioned Congress to abrogate the Ordinance entirely, or at least\r\nso far as to suspend its operation for a time, in order that they should\r\nexercise the \"popular sovereignty\" of having slaves if they wanted them.\r\nThe men then controlling the General Government, imitating the men of the\r\nRevolution, refused Indiana that privilege. And so we have the evidence\r\nthat Indiana supposed she could have slaves, if it were not for that\r\nOrdinance; that she besought Congress to put that barrier out of the way;\r\nthat Congress refused to do so; and it all ended at last in Indiana being\r\na free State. Tell me not then that the Ordinance of '87 had nothing to do\r\nwith making Indiana a free State, when we find some men chafing against,\r\nand only restrained by, that barrier.\r\n\r\nCome down again to our State of Illinois. The great Northwest Territory,\r\nincluding Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, was acquired\r\nfirst, I believe, by the British Government, in part at least, from the\r\nFrench. Before the establishment of our independence it became a part\r\nof Virginia, enabling Virginia afterward to transfer it to the General\r\nGovernment. There were French settlements in what is now Illinois, and at\r\nthe same time there were French settlements in what is now Missouri, in\r\nthe tract of country that was not purchased till about 1803. In these\r\nFrench settlements negro slavery had existed for many years, perhaps more\r\nthan a hundred; if not as much as two hundred years,--at Kaskaskia, in\r\nIllinois, and at St. Genevieve, or Cape Girardeau, perhaps, in Missouri.\r\nThe number of slaves was not very great, but there was about the same\r\nnumber in each place. They were there when we acquired the Territory.\r\nThere was no effort made to break up the relation of master and slave, and\r\neven the Ordinance of 1787 was not so enforced as to destroy that slavery\r\nin Illinois; nor did the Ordinance apply to Missouri at all.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to ask your attention to; at this point, is that Illinois and\r\nMissouri came into the Union about the same time, Illinois in the latter\r\npart of 1818, and Missouri, after a struggle, I believe sometime in 1820.\r\nThey had been filling up with American people about the same period of\r\ntime; their progress enabling them to come into the Union about the same\r\ntime. At the end of that ten years, in which they had been so preparing\r\n(for it was about that period of time), the number of slaves in Illinois\r\nhad actually decreased; while in Missouri, beginning with very few, at the\r\nend of that ten years there were about ten thousand. This being so, and it\r\nbeing remembered that Missouri and Illinois are, to a certain extent, in\r\nthe same parallel of latitude, that the northern half of Missouri and the\r\nsouthern half of Illinois are in the same parallel of latitude, so that\r\nclimate would have the same effect upon one as upon the other, and that in\r\nthe soil there is no material difference so far as bears upon the question\r\nof slavery being settled upon one or the other,--there being none of those\r\nnatural causes to produce a difference in filling them, and yet there\r\nbeing a broad difference to their filling up, we are led again to inquire\r\nwhat was the cause of that difference.\r\n\r\nIt is most natural to say that in Missouri there was no law to keep that\r\ncountry from filling up with slaves, while in Illinois there was the\r\nOrdinance of The Ordinance being there, slavery decreased during that ten\r\nyears; the Ordinance not being in the other, it increased from a few to\r\nten thousand. Can anybody doubt the reason of the difference?\r\n\r\nI think all these facts most abundantly prove that my friend Judge\r\nDouglas's proposition, that the Ordinance of '87, or the national\r\nrestriction of slavery, never had a tendency to make a free State, is a\r\nfallacy,--a proposition without the shadow or substance of truth about it.\r\n\r\nDouglas sometimes says that all the States (and it is part of this same\r\nproposition I have been discussing) that have become free have become so\r\nupon his \"great principle\"; that the State of Illinois itself came\r\ninto the Union as a slave State, and that the people, upon the \"great\r\nprinciple\" of popular sovereignty, have since made it a free State. Allow\r\nme but a little while to state to you what facts there are to justify him\r\nin saying that Illinois came into the Union as a slave State.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned to you that there were a few old French slaves there.\r\nThey numbered, I think, one or two hundred. Besides that, there had been\r\na Territorial law for indenturing black persons. Under that law, in\r\nviolation of the Ordinance of '87, but without any enforcement of the\r\nOrdinance to overthrow the system, there had been a small number of\r\nslaves introduced as indentured persons. Owing to this, the clause for\r\nthe prohibition of slavery was slightly modified. Instead of running like\r\nyours, that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except for crime,\r\nof which the party shall have been duly convicted, should exist in the\r\nState, they said that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude should\r\nthereafter be introduced; and that the children of indentured servants\r\nshould be born free; and nothing was said about the few old French slaves.\r\nOut of this fact, that the clause for prohibiting slavery was modified\r\nbecause of the actual presence of it, Douglas asserts again and again that\r\nIllinois came into the Union as a slave State. How far the facts sustain\r\nthe conclusion that he draws, it is for intelligent and impartial men\r\nto decide. I leave it with you, with these remarks, worthy of being\r\nremembered, that that little thing, those few indentured servants being\r\nthere, was of itself sufficient to modify a constitution made by a people\r\nardently desiring to have a free constitution; showing the power of the\r\nactual presence of the institution of slavery to prevent any people,\r\nhowever anxious to make a free State, from making it perfectly so.\r\n\r\nI have been detaining you longer, perhaps, than I ought to do.\r\n\r\nI am in some doubt whether to introduce another topic upon which I could\r\ntalk a while. [Cries of \"Go on,\" and \"Give us it.\"] It is this, then:\r\nDouglas's Popular sovereignty, as a principle, is simply this: If one man\r\nchooses to make a slave of another man, neither that man nor anybody else\r\nhas a right to object. Apply it to government, as he seeks to apply\r\nit, and it is this: If, in a new Territory into which a few people are\r\nbeginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes, they choose\r\nto either exclude slavery from their limits, or to establish it there,\r\nhowever one or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved, or the\r\ninfinitely greater number of persons who are afterward to inhabit that\r\nTerritory, or the other members of the family of communities of which they\r\nare but an incipient member, or the general head of the family of States\r\nas parent of all, however their action may affect one or the other of\r\nthese, there is no power or right to interfere. That is Douglas's popular\r\nsovereignty applied. Now, I think that there is a real popular sovereignty\r\nin the world. I think the definition of popular sovereignty, in the\r\nabstract, would be about this: that each man shall do precisely as he\r\npleases with himself, and with all those things which exclusively concern\r\nhim. Applied in government, this principle would be that a general\r\ngovernment shall do all those things which pertain to it, and all the\r\nlocal governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those\r\nmatters which exclusively concern them.\r\n\r\nDouglas looks upon slavery as so insignificant that the people must decide\r\nthat question for themselves; and yet they are not fit to decide who\r\nshall be their governor, judge, or secretary, or who shall be any of\r\ntheir officers. These are vast national matters in his estimation; but the\r\nlittle matter in his estimation is that of planting slavery there. That\r\nis purely of local interest, which nobody should be allowed to say a word\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nLabor is the great source from which nearly all, if not all, human\r\ncomforts and necessities are drawn. There is a difference in opinion about\r\nthe elements of labor in society. Some men assume that there is necessary\r\nconnection between capital and labor, and that connection draws within\r\nit the whole of the labor of the community. They assume that nobody works\r\nunless capital excites them to work. They begin next to consider what is\r\nthe best way. They say there are but two ways: one is to hire men, and to\r\nallure them to labor by their consent; the other is to buy the men, and\r\ndrive them, to it, and that is slavery. Having assumed that, they proceed\r\nto discuss the question of whether the laborers themselves are better off\r\nin the condition of slaves or of hired laborers, and they usually decide\r\nthat they are better off in the condition of slaves.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I say that the whole thing is a mistake. That there is\r\na certain relation between capital and labor, I admit. That it does exist,\r\nand rightfully exists, I think is true. That men who are industrious, and\r\nsober, and honest in the pursuit of their own interests should after a\r\nwhile accumulate capital, and after that should be allowed to enjoy it in\r\npeace, and also, if they should choose, when they have accumulated it,\r\nto use it to save themselves from actual labor, and hire other people\r\nto labor for them, is right. In doing so they do not wrong the man they\r\nemploy, for they find men who have not of their own land to work upon,\r\nor shops to work in, and who are benefited by working for others, hired\r\nlaborers, receiving their capital for it. Thus a few men, that own\r\ncapital, hire a few others, and these establish the relation of capital\r\nand labor rightfully, a relation of which I make no complaint. But I\r\ninsist that that relation, after all, does not embrace more than one\r\neighth of the labor of the country.\r\n\r\n[The speaker proceeded to argue that the hired laborer, with his ability\r\nto become an employer, must have every precedence over him who labors\r\nunder the inducement of force. He continued:]\r\n\r\nI have taken upon myself in the name of some of you to say that we expect\r\nupon these principles to ultimately beat them. In order to do so, I think\r\nwe want and must have a national policy in regard to the institution of\r\nslavery that acknowledges and deals with that institution as being\r\nwrong. Whoever desires the prevention of the spread of slavery and the\r\nnationalization of that institution yields all when he yields to any\r\npolicy that either recognizes slavery as being right or as being an\r\nindifferent thing. Nothing will make you successful but setting up a\r\npolicy which shall treat the thing as being wrong: When I say this, I do\r\nnot mean to say that this General Government is charged with the duty of\r\nredressing or preventing all the wrongs in the world, but I do think that\r\nit is charged with preventing and redressing all wrongs which are wrongs\r\nto itself. This Government is expressly charged with the duty of providing\r\nfor the general welfare. We believe that the spreading out and\r\nperpetuity of the institution of slavery impairs the general welfare.\r\nWe believe--nay, we know--that that is the only thing that has ever\r\nthreatened the perpetuity of the Union itself. The only thing which has\r\never menaced the destruction of the government under which we live is this\r\nvery thing. To repress this thing, we think, is, Providing for the general\r\nwelfare. Our friends in Kentucky differ from us. We need not make our\r\nargument for them, but we who think it is wrong in all its relations, or\r\nin some of them at least, must decide as to our own actions and our own\r\ncourse, upon our own judgment.\r\n\r\nI say that we must not interfere with the institution of slavery in the\r\nStates where it exists, because the Constitution forbids it, and the\r\ngeneral welfare does not require us to do so. We must not withhold an\r\nefficient Fugitive Slave law, because the Constitution requires us, as\r\nI understand it, not to withhold such a law. But we must prevent the\r\noutspreading of the institution, because neither the Constitution nor\r\ngeneral welfare requires us to extend it. We must prevent the revival of\r\nthe African slave trade, and the enacting by Congress of a Territorial\r\nslave code. We must prevent each of these things being done by either\r\nCongresses or courts. The people of these United States are the rightful\r\nmasters of both Congresses and courts, not to overthrow the Constitution,\r\nbut to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.\r\n\r\nTo do these things we must employ instrumentalities. We must hold\r\nconventions; we must adopt platforms, if we conform to ordinary custom;\r\nwe must nominate candidates; and we must carry elections. In all these\r\nthings, I think that we ought to keep in view our real purpose, and in\r\nnone do anything that stands adverse to our purpose. If we shall adopt a\r\nplatform that fails to recognize or express our purpose, or elect a man\r\nthat declares himself inimical to our purpose, we not only take nothing by\r\nour success, but we tacitly admit that we act upon no other principle\r\nthan a desire to have \"the loaves and fishes,\" by which, in the end, our\r\napparent success is really an injury to us.\r\n\r\nI know that this is very desirable with me, as with everybody else, that\r\nall the elements of the opposition shall unite in the next Presidential\r\nelection and in all future time. I am anxious that that should be; but\r\nthere are things seriously to be considered in relation to that matter.\r\nIf the terms can be arranged, I am in favor of the union. But suppose\r\nwe shall take up some man, and put him upon one end or the other of the\r\nticket, who declares himself against us in regard to the prevention of the\r\nspread of slavery, who turns up his nose and says he is tired of hearing\r\nanything more about it, who is more against us than against the enemy,\r\nwhat will be the issue? Why, he will get no slave States, after all,--he\r\nhas tried that already until being beat is the rule for him. If we\r\nnominate him upon that ground, he will not carry a slave State; and\r\nnot only so, but that portion of our men who are high-strung upon the\r\nprinciple we really fight for will not go for him, and he won't get a\r\nsingle electoral vote anywhere, except, perhaps, in the State of Maryland.\r\nThere is no use in saying to us that we are stubborn and obstinate because\r\nwe won't do some such thing as this. We cannot do it. We cannot get our\r\nmen to vote it. I speak by the card, that we cannot give the State of\r\nIllinois in such case by fifty thousand. We would be flatter down than the\r\n\"Negro Democracy\" themselves have the heart to wish to see us.\r\n\r\nAfter saying this much let me say a little on the other side. There are\r\nplenty of men in the slave States that are altogether good enough for me\r\nto be either President or Vice-President, provided they will profess their\r\nsympathy with our purpose, and will place themselves on the ground that\r\nour men, upon principle, can vote for them. There are scores of them, good\r\nmen in their character for intelligence and talent and integrity. If such\r\na one will place himself upon the right ground, I am for his occupying one\r\nplace upon the next Republican or opposition ticket. I will heartily\r\ngo for him. But unless he does so place himself, I think it a matter of\r\nperfect nonsense to attempt to bring about a union upon any other basis;\r\nthat if a union be made, the elements will scatter so that there can be no\r\nsuccess for such a ticket, nor anything like success. The good old maxims\r\nof the Bible axe applicable, and truly applicable, to human affairs, and\r\nin this, as in other things, we may say here that he who is not for us is\r\nagainst us; he who gathereth not with us, scattereth. I should be glad to\r\nhave some of the many good and able and noble men of the South to place\r\nthemselves where we can confer upon them the high honor of an election\r\nupon one or the other end of our ticket. It would do my soul good to do\r\nthat thing. It would enable us to teach them that, inasmuch as we select\r\none of their own number to carry out our principles, we are free from the\r\ncharge that we mean more than we say.\r\n\r\nBut, my friends, I have detained you much longer than I expected to do.\r\nI believe I may do myself the compliment to say that you have stayed\r\nand heard me with great patience, for which I return you my most sincere\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON PROTECTIVE TARIFFS\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD WALLACE.\r\n\r\nCLINTON, October 11, 1859\r\n\r\nDr. EDWARD WALLACE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am here just now attending court. Yesterday, before I left\r\nSpringfield, your brother, Dr. William S. Wallace, showed me a letter of\r\nyours, in which you kindly mention my name, inquiring for my tariff views,\r\nand suggest the propriety of my writing a letter upon the subject. I was\r\nan old Henry-Clay-Tariff Whig. In old times I made more speeches on that\r\nsubject than any other.\r\n\r\nI have not since changed my views. I believe yet, if we could have a\r\nmoderate, carefully adjusted protective tariff, so far acquiesced in as\r\nnot to be a perpetual subject of political strife, squabbles changes, and\r\nuncertainties, it would be better for us. Still it is my opinion that just\r\nnow the revival of that question will not advance the cause itself, or the\r\nman who revives it.\r\n\r\nI have not thought much on the subject recently, but my general impression\r\nis that the necessity for a protective tariff will ere long force its\r\nold opponents to take it up; and then its old friends can join in and\r\nestablish it on a more firm and durable basis. We, the Old Whigs, have\r\nbeen entirely beaten out on the tariff question, and we shall not be able\r\nto re-establish the policy until the absence of it shall have demonstrated\r\nthe necessity for it in the minds of men heretofore opposed to it.\r\nWith this view, I should prefer to not now write a public letter on the\r\nsubject. I therefore wish this to be considered confidential. I shall be\r\nvery glad to receive a letter from you.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON MORTGAGES\r\n\r\nTO W. DUNGY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, November, 2, 1859.\r\n\r\nWM. DUNGY, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of October 27 is received. When a mortgage is given\r\nto secure two notes, and one of the notes is sold and assigned, if the\r\nmortgaged premises are only sufficient to pay one note, the one assigned\r\nwill take it all. Also, an execution from a judgment on the assigned note\r\nmay take it all; it being the same thing in substance. There is redemption\r\non execution sales from the United States Court just as from any other\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nYou did not mention the name of the plaintiff or defendant in the suit,\r\nand so I can tell nothing about it as to sales, bids, etc. Write again.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1859.\r\n\r\n............. But you Democrats are for the Union; and you greatly fear\r\nthe success of the Republicans would destroy the Union. Why? Do the\r\nRepublicans declare against the Union? Nothing like it. Your own statement\r\nof it is that if the Black Republicans elect a President, you \"won't stand\r\nit.\" You will break up the Union. If we shall constitutionally elect a\r\nPresident, it will be our duty to see that you submit. Old John Brown has\r\nbeen executed for treason against a State. We cannot object, even though\r\nhe agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong. That cannot excuse violence,\r\nbloodshed and treason. It could avail him nothing that he might think\r\nhimself right. So, if we constitutionally elect a President, and therefore\r\nyou undertake to destroy the Union, it will be our duty to deal with you\r\nas old John Brown has been dealt with. We shall try to do our duty. We\r\nhope and believe that in no section will a majority so act as to render\r\nsuch extreme measures necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. W. DOLE, G. S. HUBBARD, AND W. H. BROWN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. 14, 1859\r\n\r\nMESSRS. DOLE, HUBBARD & BROWN.\r\n\r\nGENT.:--Your favor of the 12th is at hand, and it gives me pleasure to\r\nbe able to answer it. It is not my intention to take part in any of\r\nthe rivalries for the gubernatorial nomination; but the fear of being\r\nmisunderstood upon that subject ought not to deter me from doing justice\r\nto Mr. Judd, and preventing a wrong being done to him by the use of nay\r\nname in connection with alleged wrongs to me.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your first question, as to whether Mr. Judd was guilty of\r\nany unfairness to me at the time of Senator Trumbull's election, I answer\r\nunhesitatingly in the negative; Mr. Judd owed no political allegiance\r\nto any party whose candidate I was. He was in the Senate, holding over,\r\nhaving been elected by a Democratic Constituency. He never was in any\r\ncaucus of the friends who sought to make me U. S. Senator, never gave me\r\nany promises or pledges to support me, and subsequent events have greatly\r\ntended to prove the wisdom, politically, of Mr. Judd's course. The\r\nelection of Judge Trumbull strongly tended to sustain and preserve the\r\nposition of that lion of the Democrats who condemned the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise, and left them in a position of joining with us in\r\nforming the Republican party, as was done at the Bloomington convention in\r\n1856.\r\n\r\nDuring the canvass of 1858 for the senatorship my belief was, and\r\nstill is, that I had no more sincere and faithful friend than Mr.\r\nJudd--certainly none whom I trusted more. His position as chairman of the\r\nState Central Committee led to my greater intercourse with him, and to\r\nmy giving him a larger share of my confidence, than with or to almost any\r\nother friend; and I have never suspected that that confidence was, to any\r\ndegree, misplaced.\r\n\r\nMy relations with Mr. Judo since the organization of the Republican\r\nparty, in, our State, in 1856, and especially since the adjournment of the\r\nLegislature in Feb., 1857, have been so very intimate that I deem it an\r\nimpossibility that he could have been dealing treacherously with me. He\r\nhas also, at all times, appeared equally true and faithful to the party.\r\nIn his position as chairman of the committee, I believe he did all that\r\nany man could have done. The best of us are liable to commit errors, which\r\nbecome apparent by subsequent developments; but I do not know of a single\r\nerror, even, committed by Mr. Judd, since he and I have acted together\r\npolitically.\r\n\r\nI, had occasionally heard these insinuations against Mr. Judd, before the\r\nreceipt of your letter; and in no instance have I hesitated to pronounce\r\nthem wholly unjust, to the full extent of my knowledge and belief. I have\r\nbeen, and still am, very anxious to take no part between the many friends,\r\nall good and true, who are mentioned as candidates for a Republican\r\ngubernatorial nomination; but I can not feel that my own honor is quite\r\nclear if I remain silent when I hear any one of them assailed about\r\nmatters of which I believe I know more than his assailants.\r\n\r\nI take pleasure in adding that, of all the avowed friends I had in the\r\ncanvass of last year, I do not suspect any of having acted treacherously\r\nto me, or to our cause; and that there is not one of them in whose\r\nhonesty, honor, and integrity I, today, have greater confidence than I\r\nhave in those of Mr. Judd.\r\n\r\nI dislike to appear before the public in this matter; but you are at\r\nliberty to make such use of this letter as you may think justice requires.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. M. PARSONS AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 19, 1859.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. G. M. PARSONS AND OTHERS, CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, ETC.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter of the 7th instant, accompanied by a similar one\r\nfrom the governor-elect, the Republican State officers, and the Republican\r\nmembers of the State Board of Equalization of Ohio, both requesting of me,\r\nfor publication in permanent form, copies of the political debates between\r\nSenator Douglas and myself last year, has been received. With my grateful\r\nacknowledgments to both you and them for the very flattering terms in\r\nwhich the request is communicated, I transmit you the copies. The copies I\r\nsend you are as reported and printed by the respective friends of Senator\r\nDouglas and myself, at the time--that is, his by his friends, and mine by\r\nmine. It would be an unwarrantable liberty for us to change a word or\r\na letter in his, and the changes I have made in mine, you perceive, are\r\nverbal only, and very few in number. I wish the reprint to be precisely as\r\nthe copies I send, without any comment whatever.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH\r\n\r\nTO J. W. FELL,\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, December 20, 1859.\r\n\r\nJ. W. FELL, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Herewith is a little sketch, as you requested. There is not\r\nmuch of it, for the reason, I suppose, that there is not much of me. If\r\nanything be made out of it, I wish it to be modest, and not to go beyond\r\nthe material. If it were thought necessary to incorporate anything from\r\nany of my speeches I suppose there would be no objection. Of course it\r\nmust not appear to have been written by myself.\r\n\r\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI was born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My parents\r\nwere both born in Virginia, of undistinguished families--second families,\r\nperhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth year, was of a\r\nfamily of the name of Hanks, some of whom now reside in Adams, and others\r\nin Macon County, Illinois. My paternal grandfather, Abraham Lincoln,\r\nemigrated from Rockingham County, Virginia, to Kentucky about 1781 or\r\n1782, where a year or two later he was killed by the Indians, not in\r\nbattle, but by stealth, when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest.\r\nHis ancestors, who were Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks County,\r\nPennsylvania. An effort to identify them with the New England family\r\nof the same name ended in nothing more definite than a similarity of\r\nChristian names in both families, such as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai, Solomon,\r\nAbraham, and the like.\r\n\r\nMy father, at the death of his father, was but six years of age, and he\r\ngrew up literally without education. He removed from Kentucky to what is\r\nnow Spencer County, Indiana, in my eighth year. We reached our new home\r\nabout the time that State came into the Union. It was a wild region, with\r\nmany bears and other wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up.\r\nThere were some schools, so called, but no qualification was ever required\r\nof a teacher beyond \"readin', writin', and cipherin\"' to the Rule of\r\nThree. If a straggler supposed to understand Latin happened to sojourn\r\nin the neighborhood he was looked upon as a wizard. There was absolutely\r\nnothing to excite ambition for education. Of course, when I came of age I\r\ndid not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and cipher to\r\nthe Rule of Three, but that was all. I have not been to school since. The\r\nlittle advance I now have upon this store of education I have picked up\r\nfrom time to time under the pressure of necessity.\r\n\r\nI was raised to farm work, which I continued till I was twenty-two. At\r\ntwenty-one I came to Illinois, Macon County. Then I got to New Salem, at\r\nthat time in Sangamon, now in Menard County, where I remained a year as a\r\nsort of clerk in a store. Then came the Black Hawk war; and I was elected\r\na captain of volunteers, a success which gave me more pleasure than any I\r\nhave had since. I went the campaign, was elected, ran for the Legislature\r\nthe same year (1832), and was beaten--the only time I ever have been\r\nbeaten by the people. The next and three succeeding biennial elections I\r\nwas elected to the Legislature. I was not a candidate afterward. During\r\nthis legislative period I had studied law, and removed to Springfield to\r\npractice it. In 1846 I was once elected to the lower House of Congress.\r\nWas not a candidate for re-election. From 1849 to 1854, both inclusive,\r\npracticed law more assiduously than ever before. Always a Whig in\r\npolitics; and generally on the Whig electoral tickets, making active\r\ncanvasses. I was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise aroused me again. What I have done since then is\r\npretty well known.\r\n\r\nIf any personal description of me is thought desirable, it may be said I\r\nam, in height, six feet four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing on an\r\naverage one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black\r\nhair and gray eyes. No other marks or brands recollected.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON NOMINATION TO THE NATIONAL TICKET\r\n\r\nTo N. B. JUDD.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, FEBRUARY 9, 1859\r\n\r\nHON. N. B. JUDD.\r\n\r\nDEAR Sir:--I am not in a position where it would hurt much for me to not\r\nbe nominated on the national ticket; but I am where it would hurt some\r\nfor me to not get the Illinois delegates. What I expected when I wrote\r\nthe letter to Messrs. Dole and others is now happening. Your discomfited\r\nassailants are most bitter against me; and they will, for revenge upon me,\r\nlay to the Bates egg in the South, and to the Seward egg in the North, and\r\ngo far toward squeezing me out in the middle with nothing. Can you help\r\nme a little in this matter in your end of the vineyard. I mean this to be\r\nprivate.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT THE COOPER INSTITUTE, NEW YORK FEBRUARY 27, 1860\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF NEW YORK:--The facts with which I\r\nshall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar; nor is there anything\r\nnew in the general use I shall make of them. If there shall be any\r\nnovelty, it will be in the mode of presenting the facts, and the\r\ninferences and observations following that presentation.\r\n\r\nIn his speech last autumn at Columbus, Ohio, as reported in the New York\r\nTimes, Senator Douglas said:\r\n\r\n\"Our fathers, when they framed the Government under which we live,\r\nunderstood this question just as well, and even better than we do now.\"\r\n\r\nI fully indorse this, and I adopt it as a text for this discourse. I so\r\nadopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting-point for\r\na discussion between Republicans and that wing of the Democracy headed by\r\nSenator Douglas. It simply leaves the inquiry: What was the understanding\r\nthose fathers had of the question mentioned?\r\n\r\nWhat is the frame of Government under which we live?\r\n\r\nThe answer must be--the Constitution of the United States. That\r\nConstitution consists of the original, framed in 1787 (and under which\r\nthe present Government first went into operation), and twelve subsequently\r\nframed amendments, the first ten of which were framed in 1789.\r\n\r\nWho were our fathers that framed the Constitution? I suppose the\r\n\"thirty-nine\" who signed the original instrument may be fairly called\r\nour fathers who framed that part of the present Government. It is almost\r\nexactly true to say they framed it, and it is altogether true to say they\r\nfairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTheir names, being familiar to nearly all, and accessible to quite all,\r\nneed not now be repeated.\r\n\r\nI take these \"thirty-nine,\" for the present, as being our \"fathers who\r\nframed the Government under which we live.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the question which, according to the text, those fathers\r\nunderstood \"just as well, and even better than we do now\"?\r\n\r\nIt is this: Does the proper division of local from Federal authority, or\r\nanything in the Constitution, forbid our Federal Government to control as\r\nto slavery in our Federal Territories?\r\n\r\nUpon this Senator Douglas holds the affirmative, and Republicans the\r\nnegative. This affirmation and denial form an issue, and this issue--this\r\nquestion is precisely what the text declares our fathers understood\r\n\"better than we.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire whether the \"thirty-nine,\" or any of them, acted upon\r\nthis question; and if they did, how they acted upon it--how they expressed\r\nthat better understanding.\r\n\r\nIn 1784, three years before the Constitution--the United States then\r\nowning the Northwestern Territory, and no other--the Congress of the\r\nConfederation had before them the question of prohibiting slavery in\r\nthat Territory; and four of the \"thirty nine\" who afterward framed the\r\nConstitution were in that Congress and voted on that question. Of\r\nthese, Roger Sherman, Thomas Mifflin, and Hugh Williamson voted for the\r\nprohibition, thus showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing\r\nlocal from Federal authority, nor anything else, properly forbade the\r\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory. The\r\nother of the four--James McHenry voted against the prohibition, showing\r\nthat, for some cause, he thought it improper to vote for it.\r\n\r\nIn 1787, still before the Constitution, but while the convention was in\r\nsession framing it, and while the Northwestern Territory still was\r\nthe only Territory owned by the United States, the same question of\r\nprohibiting slavery in the Territory again came before the Congress of the\r\nConfederation; and two more of the \"thirty-nine\" who afterward signed the\r\nConstitution were in that Congress, and voted on the question. They were\r\nWilliam Blount and William Few; and they both voted for the prohibition\r\nthus showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from\r\nFederal authority, nor anything else, properly forbade the Federal\r\nGovernment to control as to slavery in Federal territory. This time the\r\nprohibition became a law, being part of what is now well known as the\r\nOrdinance of '87.\r\n\r\nThe question of Federal control of slavery in the Territories seems not\r\nto have been directly before the convention which framed the original\r\nConstitution; and hence it is not recorded that the \"thirty-nine,\" or any\r\nof them, while engaged on that instrument, expressed any opinion on that\r\nprecise question.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution, an act\r\nwas passed to enforce the Ordinance of '87, including the prohibition of\r\nslavery in the Northwestern Territory. The bill for this act was reported\r\nby one of the \"thirty-nine,\" Thomas Fitzsimmons, then a member of the\r\nHouse of Representatives from Pennsylvania. It went through all its stages\r\nwithout a word of opposition, and finally passed both branches without\r\nyeas and nays, which is equivalent to a unanimous passage. In this\r\nCongress there were sixteen of the thirty-nine fathers who framed the\r\noriginal Constitution. They were John Langdon, Nicholas Gilman, Wm. S.\r\nJohnnson, Roger Sherman, Robert Morris, Thos. Fitzsimmons, William Few,\r\nAbraham Baldwin, Rufus King, William Paterson, George Claimer, Richard\r\nBassett, George Read, Pierce Butler, Daniel Carroll, James Madison.\r\n\r\nThis shows that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from\r\nFederal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, properly forbade\r\nCongress to prohibit slavery in the Federal territory; else both their\r\nfidelity to correct principles and their oath to support the Constitution\r\nwould have constrained them to oppose the prohibition.\r\n\r\nAgain: George Washington, another of the \"thirty nine,\" was then President\r\nof the United States, and, as such, approved and signed the bill;\r\nthus completing its validity as a law, and thus showing that, in his\r\nunderstanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything\r\nin the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to\r\nslavery in Federal territory.\r\n\r\nNo great while after the adoption of the original Constitution, North\r\nCarolina ceded to the Federal Government the country now constituting the\r\nState of Tennessee; and, a few years later, Georgia ceded that which\r\nnow constitutes the States of Mississippi and Alabama. In both deeds of\r\ncession it was made a condition by the ceding States that the Federal\r\nGovernment should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country. Besides this,\r\nslavery was then actually in the ceded country. Under these circumstances,\r\nCongress, on taking charge of these countries, did not absolutely prohibit\r\nslavery within them. But they did interfere with it--take control of\r\nit--even there, to a certain extent. In 1798, Congress organized the\r\nTerritory of Mississippi: In the act of organization they prohibited the\r\nbringing of slaves into the Territory from any place without the United\r\nStates, by fine and giving freedom to slaves so brought. This act passed\r\nboth branches of Congress without yeas and nays. In that Congress were\r\nthree of the \"thirty-nine\" who framed the original Constitution. They were\r\nJohn Langdon, George Read, and Abraham Baldwin. They all, probably, voted\r\nfor it. Certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon\r\nrecord, if, in their understanding, any line dividing local from Federal\r\nauthority, or anything in the Constitution, properly forbade the Federal\r\nGovernment to control as to slavery in Federal territory.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, the Federal Government purchased the Louisiana country. Our\r\nformer territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own States;\r\nbut this Louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation. In 1804,\r\nCongress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now\r\nconstitutes the State of Lousiana. New Orleans, lying within that part,\r\nwas an old and comparatively large city. There were other considerable\r\ntowns and settlements, and slavery was extensively and thoroughly\r\nintermingled with the people. Congress did not, in the Territorial Act,\r\nprohibit slavery; but they did interfere with it take control of it--in\r\na more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of Mississippi.\r\nThe substance of the provision therein made in relation to slaves was:\r\n\r\nFirst. That no slave should be imported into the Territory from foreign\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nSecond. That no slave should be carried into it who had been imported into\r\nthe United States since the first day of May, 1798.\r\n\r\nThird. That no slave should be carried into it except by the owner, and\r\nfor his own use as a settler; the penalty in all the cases being a fine\r\nupon the violator of the law, and freedom to the slave.\r\n\r\nThis act also was passed without yeas and nays. In the Congress which\r\npassed it there were two of the \"thirty-nine.\" They were Abraham Baldwin\r\nand Jonathan Dayton. As stated in the case of Mississippi, it is probable\r\nthey both voted for it. They would not have allowed it to pass without\r\nrecording their opposition to it, if, in their understanding, it violated\r\neither the line properly dividing local from Federal authority, or any\r\nprovision of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn 1819-20 came and passed the Missouri question. Many votes were taken,\r\nby yeas and nays, in both branches of Congress, upon the various phases\r\nof the general question. Two of the \"thirty-nine\"--Rufus King and Charles\r\nPinckney were members of that Congress. Mr. King steadily voted for\r\nslavery prohibition and against all compromises, while Mr. Pinckney as\r\nsteadily voted against slavery prohibition, and against all compromises.\r\nBy this, Mr. King showed that, in his understanding, no line dividing\r\nlocal from Federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, was\r\nviolated by Congress prohibiting slavery in Federal territory; while Mr.\r\nPinckney, by his vote, showed that in his understanding there was some\r\nsufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case.\r\n\r\nThe cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the \"thirty-nine,\" or of\r\nany of them, upon the direct issue, which I have been able to discover.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate the persons who thus acted, as being four in 1784, two\r\nin 1787, seventeen in 1789, three in 1798, two in 1804, and two in\r\n1819-20--there would be thirty of them. But this would be counting, John\r\nLangdon, Roger Sherman, William Few, Rufus King, and George Read, each\r\ntwice, and Abraham Baldwin three times. The true number of those of the\r\n\"thirty-nine\" whom I have shown to have acted upon the question which, by\r\nthe text, they understood better than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen\r\nnot shown to have acted upon it in any way.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have twenty-three out of our thirty-nine fathers \"who\r\nframed the Government under which we live,\" who have, upon their official\r\nresponsibility and their corporal oaths, acted upon the very question\r\nwhich the text affirms they \"understood just as well, and even better\r\nthan we do now\"; and twenty-one of them--a clear majority of the whole\r\n\"thirty-nine\"--so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political\r\nimpropriety and wilful perjury, if, in their understanding, any proper\r\ndivision between local and Federal authority, or anything in the\r\nConstitution they had made themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the\r\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories.\r\nThus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder than words, so\r\nactions under such responsibilities speak still louder.\r\n\r\nTwo of the twenty-three voted against Congressional prohibition of slavery\r\nin the Federal Territories, in the instances in which they acted upon the\r\nquestion. But for what reasons they so voted is not known. They may have\r\ndone so because they thought a proper division of local from Federal\r\nauthority, or some provision or principle of the Constitution, stood in\r\nthe way; or they may, without any such question, have voted against\r\nthe prohibition on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds\r\nof expediency. No one who has sworn to support the Constitution can\r\nconscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional\r\nmeasure, however expedient he may think it; but one may and ought to vote\r\nagainst a measure which he deems constitutional, if, at the same time, he\r\ndeems it inexpedient. It therefore would be unsafe to set down even the\r\ntwo who voted against the prohibition as having done so because, in their\r\nunderstanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or\r\nanything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as\r\nto slavery in Federal territory.\r\n\r\nThe remaining sixteen of the \"thirty-nine,\" so far as I have discovered,\r\nhave left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of\r\nFederal control on slavery in the Federal Territories. But there is much\r\nreason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not\r\nhave appeared different from that of their twenty-three compeers, had it\r\nbeen manifested at all.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have purposely omitted\r\nwhatever understanding may have been manifested by any person, however\r\ndistinguished, other than the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original\r\nConstitution; and, for the same reason, I have also omitted whatever\r\nunderstanding may have been manifested by any of the \"thirty tine\" even on\r\nany other phase of the general question of slavery. If we should look into\r\ntheir acts and declarations on those other phases, as the foreign slave\r\ntrade, and the morality and policy of slavery generally, it would appear\r\nto us that on the direct question of Federal control of slavery in Federal\r\nTerritories, the sixteen, if they had acted at all, would probably have\r\nacted just as the twenty-three did. Among that sixteen were several of\r\nthe most noted anti-slavery men of those times--as Dr. Franklin, Alexander\r\nHamilton, and Gouverneur Morris while there was not one now known to have\r\nbeen otherwise, unless it may be John Rutledge, of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe sum of the whole is, that of our thirty-nine fathers who framed\r\nthe original Constitution, twenty-one--a clear majority of the\r\nwhole--certainly understood that no proper division of local from\r\nFederal authority, nor any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal\r\nGovernment to control slavery in the Federal Territories; whilst all the\r\nrest probably had the same understanding. Such, unquestionably, was the\r\nunderstanding of our fathers who framed the original Constitution; and the\r\ntext affirms that they understood the question \"better than we.\"\r\n\r\nBut, so far, I have been considering the understanding of the question\r\nmanifested by the framers of the original Constitution. In and by the\r\noriginal instrument, a mode was provided for amending it; and, as I have\r\nalready stated, the present frame of \"the Government under which we live\"\r\nconsists of that original, and twelve amendatory articles framed and\r\nadopted since. Those who now insist that Federal control of slavery in\r\nFederal Territories violates the Constitution, point us to the provisions\r\nwhich they suppose it thus violates; and, as I understand, they all fix\r\nupon provisions in these amendatory articles, and not in the original\r\ninstrument. The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott case, plant themselves\r\nupon the fifth amendment, which provides that no person shall be deprived\r\nof \"life, liberty, or property without due process of law\"; while Senator\r\nDouglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth\r\namendment, providing that \"the powers not delegated to the United States\r\nby the Constitution\" \"are reserved to the States respectively, or to the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nNow, it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first Congress\r\nwhich sat under the Constitution--the identical Congress which passed\r\nthe act already mentioned, enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the\r\nNorthwestern Territory. Not only was it the same Congress, but they were\r\nthe identical same individual men who, at the same session, and at the\r\nsame time within the session, had under consideration, and in progress\r\ntoward maturity, these Constitutional amendments, and this act prohibiting\r\nslavery in all the territory the nation then owned. The Constitutional\r\namendments were introduced before and passed after the act enforcing the\r\nOrdinance of '87; so that, during the whole pendency of the act to enforce\r\nthe Ordinance, the Constitutional amendments were also pending.\r\n\r\nThe seventy-six members of that Congress, including sixteen of the framers\r\nof the original Constitution, as before stated, were pre-eminently our\r\nfathers who framed that part of \"the Government under which we live,\"\r\nwhich is now claimed as forbidding the Federal Government to control\r\nslavery in the Federal Territories.\r\n\r\nIs it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that\r\nthe two things which that Congress deliberately framed, and carried to\r\nmaturity at the same time, are absolutely inconsistent with each other?\r\nAnd does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with\r\nthe other affirmation from the same mouth, that those who did the two\r\nthings alleged to be inconsistent understood whether they really were\r\ninconsistent better than we--better than he who affirms that they are\r\ninconsistent?\r\n\r\nIt is surely safe to assume that the thirty-nine framers of the original\r\nConstitution, and the seventy-six members of the Congress which framed the\r\namendments thereto, taken together, do certainly include those who may be\r\nfairly called \"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live.\"\r\nAnd, so assuming, I defy any man to show that any one of them ever, in his\r\nwhole life, declared that, in his understanding, any proper division of\r\nlocal from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the\r\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories. I\r\ngo a step further. I defy any one to show that any living man in the\r\nworld ever did, prior to the beginning of the present century (and I\r\nmight almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present\r\ncentury), declare that, in his understanding, any proper division of\r\nlocal from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the\r\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories.\r\nTo those who now so declare, I give not only \"our fathers who framed the\r\nGovernment under which we live,\" but with them all other living men within\r\nthe century in which it was framed, among whom to search, and they shall\r\nnot be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them.\r\n\r\nNow and here let me guard a little against being misunderstood. I do not\r\nmean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers\r\ndid. To do so would be to discard all the lights of current experience to\r\nreject all progress, all improvement. What I do say is that, if we would\r\nsupplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case, we should\r\ndo so upon evidence so conclusive, and argument so clear, that even their\r\ngreat authority, fairly considered and weighed, cannot stand; and most\r\nsurely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the\r\nquestion better than we.\r\n\r\nIf any man at this day sincerely believes that proper division of local\r\nfrom Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbids the\r\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories, he\r\nis right to say so, and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence\r\nand fair argument which he can. But he has no right to mislead others who\r\nhave less access to history, and less leisure to study it, into the false\r\nbelief that \"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live\"\r\nwere of the same opinion thus substituting falsehood and deception for\r\ntruthful evidence and fair argument. If any man at this day sincerely\r\nbelieves \"our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live,\"\r\nused and applied principles, in other cases, which ought to have led them\r\nto understand that a proper division of local from Federal authority, or\r\nsome part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control\r\nas to slavery in the Federal Territories, he is right to say so. But he\r\nshould, at the same time, brave the responsibility of declaring that,\r\nin his opinion, he understands their principles better than they did\r\nthemselves; and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by\r\nasserting that they \"understood the question just as well, and even better\r\nthan we do now.\"\r\n\r\nBut enough! Let all who believe that \"our fathers, who framed the\r\nGovernment under which we live, understood this question just as well, and\r\neven better than we do now,\" speak as they spoke, and act as they acted\r\nupon it. This is all Republicans ask--all Republicans desire--in relation\r\nto slavery. As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked, as an\r\nevil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only because\r\nof, and so far as, its actual presence among us makes that toleration and\r\nprotection a necessity. Let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be\r\nnot grudgingly, but fully and fairly maintained. For this Republicans\r\ncontend, and with this, so far as I know or believe, they will be content.\r\n\r\nAnd now, if they would listen--as I suppose they will not--I would address\r\na few words to the Southern people.\r\n\r\nI would say to them: You consider yourselves a reasonable and a just\r\npeople; and I consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice\r\nyou are not inferior to any other people. Still, when you speak of us\r\nRepublicans, you do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the\r\nbest, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates\r\nor murderers, but nothing like it to \"Black Republicans.\" In all\r\nyour contentions with one another, each of you deems an unconditional\r\ncondemnation of \"Black Republicanism\" as the first thing to be attended\r\nto. Indeed, such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable\r\nprerequisite license, so to speak among you, to be admitted or permitted\r\nto speak at all: Now; can you, or not, be prevailed upon to pause, and to\r\nconsider whether this is quite just to us, or even to yourselves? Bring\r\nforward your charges and specifications, and then be patient long enough\r\nto hear us deny or justify.\r\n\r\nYou say we are sectional. We deny it. That makes an issue; and the burden\r\nof proof is upon you. You produce your proof; and what is it? Why, that\r\nour party has no existence in your section--gets no votes in your section.\r\nThe fact is substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If it does,\r\nthen in case we should, without change of principle, begin to get votes in\r\nyour section, we should thereby cease to be sectional. You cannot escape\r\nthis conclusion; and yet, are you willing to abide by it? If you are, you\r\nwill probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional, for we shall\r\nget votes in your section this very year. You will then begin to discover,\r\nas the truth plainly is, that your proof, does not touch the issue. The\r\nfact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making, and\r\nnot of ours. And if there be fault in that fact, that fault is primarily\r\nyours, and remains so until you show that we repel you by, some wrong\r\nprinciple or practice. If we do repel you by any wrong principle or\r\npractice, the fault is ours; but this brings you to where you ought to\r\nhave started to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If\r\nour principle, put in practice, would wrong your section for the benefit\r\nof ours, or for any other object, then our principle, and we with it, are\r\nsectional, and are justly opposed and denounced as such. Meet us, then, on\r\nthe question of whether our principle, put in practice, would wrong your\r\nsection; and so meet us as if it were possible that something may be said\r\non our side. Do you accept the challenge? No! Then you really believe that\r\nthe principle which \"our fathers who framed the Government under which we\r\nlive\" thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and\r\nagain, upon their official oaths, is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand\r\nyour condemnation without a moment's consideration.\r\n\r\nSome of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional\r\nparties given by Washington in his Farewell Address. Less than eight years\r\nbefore Washington gave that warning, he had, as President of the United\r\nStates, approved and signed an act of Congress enforcing the prohibition\r\nof slavery in the Northwestern Territory, which act embodied the policy of\r\nthe Government upon that subject up to, and at, the very moment he penned\r\nthat warning; and about one year after he penned it, he wrote La Fayette\r\nthat he considered that prohibition a wise measure, expressing in the same\r\nconnection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon\r\nthis same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or\r\nin our hands against you? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast\r\nthe blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon\r\nyou, who repudiate it? We respect that warning of Washington, and we\r\ncommend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right\r\napplication of it.\r\n\r\nBut you say you are conservative--eminently conservative--while we\r\nare revolutionary, destructive, or something, of the sort. What is\r\nconservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against a new and\r\nuntried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point\r\nin controversy which was adopted by \"our fathers who framed the Government\r\nunder which we live\"; while you with one accord reject, and scout, and\r\nspit upon that old policy and insist upon substituting something new.\r\nTrue, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be.\r\nYou are divided on new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in\r\nrejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some of you are\r\nfor reviving the foreign slave trade; some for a Congressional slave\r\ncode for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the Territories to\r\nprohibit slavery within their limits; some for maintaining slavery in the\r\nTerritories through the judiciary; some for the \"gur-reat pur-rinciple\"\r\nthat \"if one man would enslave another, no third man should object,\"\r\nfantastically called \"popular sovereignty\"; but never a man among you in\r\nfavor of Federal prohibition of slavery in Federal Territories, according\r\nto the practice of \"our fathers who framed the Government under which\r\nwe live.\" Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an\r\nadvocate in the century within which our Government originated. Consider,\r\nthen, whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves, and your charge\r\nof destructiveness against us, are based on the most clear and stable\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nAgain: You say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it\r\nformerly was. We deny it. We admit that it is more prominent, but we deny\r\nthat we made it so. It was not we, but you, who discarded the old policy\r\nof the fathers. We resisted and still resist your innovation; and thence\r\ncomes the greater prominence of the question. Would you have that question\r\nreduced to its former proportions? Go back to that old policy. What has\r\nbeen will be again, under the same conditions. If you would have the peace\r\nof the old times, readopt the precepts and policy of the old times.\r\n\r\nYou charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves. We deny it;\r\nand what is your proof'? Harper's Ferry! John Brown!! John Brown was no\r\nRepublican; and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his\r\nHarper's Ferry enterprise. If any member of our party is guilty in that\r\nmatter you know it or you do not know it. If you do know it, you are\r\ninexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact. If you do\r\nnot know it, you are inexcusable for asserting it, and especially for\r\npersisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the\r\nproof. You need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not\r\nknow to be true is simply malicious slander.\r\n\r\nSome of you admit that no Republican designedly aided or encouraged\r\nthe Harper's Ferry affair, but still insist that our doctrines and\r\ndeclarations necessarily lead to such results. We do not believe it. We\r\nknow we hold to no doctrine, and make no declaration, which were not held\r\nto and made by our fathers who framed the Government under which we live.\r\nYou never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair. When it occurred,\r\nsome important State elections were near at hand, and you were in evident\r\nglee with the belief that, by charging the blame upon us, you could get\r\nan advantage of us in those elections. The elections came, and your\r\nexpectations were not quite fulfilled. Every Republican man knew that,\r\nas to himself at least, your charge was a slander, and he was not much\r\ninclined by it to cast his vote in your favor. Republican doctrines\r\nand declarations are accompanied with a continued protest against any\r\ninterference whatever with your slaves, or with you about your slaves.\r\nSurely, this does not encourage them to revolt. True, we do, in common\r\nwith \"our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live,\" declare\r\nour belief that slavery is wrong; but the slaves do not hear us declare\r\neven this. For any thing we say or do, the slaves would scarcely know\r\nthere is a Republican party. I believe they would not, in fact, generally\r\nknow it but for your misrepresentations of us in their hearing. In your\r\npolitical contests among yourselves, each faction charges the other with\r\nsympathy with Black Republicanism; and then, to give point to the charge,\r\ndefines Black Republicanism to simply be insurrection, blood, and thunder\r\namong the slaves.\r\n\r\nSlave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the\r\nRepublican party was organized. What induced the Southampton insurrection,\r\ntwenty-eight years ago, in which, at least, three times as many lives\r\nwere lost as at Harper's Ferry? You can scarcely stretch your very\r\nelastic fancy to the conclusion that Southampton was \"got up by Black\r\nRepublicanism.\" In the present state of things in the United States, I\r\ndo not think a general or even a very extensive slave insurrection is\r\npossible. The indispensable concert of action cannot be attained. The\r\nslaves have no means of rapid communication; nor can incendiary freemen,\r\nblack or white, supply it. The explosive materials are everywhere in\r\nparcels; but there neither are, nor can be supplied the indispensable\r\nconnecting trains.\r\n\r\nMuch is said by Southern people about the affection of slaves for their\r\nmasters and mistresses; and a part of it, at least, is true. A plot for an\r\nuprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty individuals\r\nbefore some one of them, to save the life of a favorite master or\r\nmistress, would divulge it. This is the rule; and the slave revolution\r\nin Hayti was not an exception to it, but a case occurring under peculiar\r\ncircumstances. The gunpowder plot of British history, though not connected\r\nwith slaves, was more in point. In that case, only about twenty were\r\nadmitted to the secret; and yet one of them, in his anxiety to save a\r\nfriend, betrayed the plot to that friend, and, by consequence, averted\r\nthe calamity. Occasional poisonings from the kitchen, and open or stealthy\r\nassassinations in the field, and local revolts, extending to a score\r\nor so, will continue to occur as the natural results of slavery; but no\r\ngeneral insurrection of slaves, as I think, can happen in this country for\r\na long time. Whoever much fears or much hopes for such an event will be\r\nalike disappointed.\r\n\r\nIn the language of Mr. Jefferson, uttered many years ago, \"It is still in\r\nour power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably,\r\nand in such slow degrees as that the evil will wear off insensibly, and\r\ntheir places be, pari passu, filled up by free white laborers. If, on the\r\ncontrary, it is left to force itself on, human nature must shudder at the\r\nprospect held up.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson did not mean to say, nor do I, that the power of\r\nemancipation is in the Federal Government. He spoke of Virginia; and, as\r\nto the power of emancipation, I speak of the slave holding States\r\nonly. The Federal Government, however, as we insist, has the power of\r\nrestraining the extension of the institution--the power to insure that\r\na slave insurrection shall never occur on any American soil which is now\r\nfree from slavery.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown's effort was peculiar. It was not a slave insurrection. It\r\nwas an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves, in which the\r\nslaves refused to participate. In fact, it was so absurd that the slaves,\r\nwith all their ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not succeed. That\r\naffair, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many attempts related in\r\nhistory at the assassination of kings and emperors. An enthusiast broods\r\nover the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by\r\nHeaven to liberate them. He ventures the attempt, which ends in little\r\nelse than his own execution. Orsini's attempt on Louis Napoleon and John\r\nBrown's attempt at Harper's Ferry were, in their philosophy, precisely the\r\nsame. The eagerness to cast blame on old England in the one case, and\r\non New England in the other, does not disprove the sameness of the two\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nAnd how much would it avail you, if you could, by the use of John Brown,\r\nHelper's Book, and the like, break up the Republican organization? Human\r\naction can be modified to some extent, but human nature cannot be changed.\r\nThere is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation, which\r\ncast at least a million and a half of votes. You cannot destroy that\r\njudgment and feeling--that sentiment--by breaking up the political\r\norganization which rallies around it. You can scarcely scatter and\r\ndisperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your\r\nheaviest fire; but if you could, how much would you gain by forcing the\r\nsentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot-box,\r\ninto some other channel? What would that other channel probably be? Would\r\nthe number of John Browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation?\r\n\r\nBut you will break up the Union rather than submit to a denial of your\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n\r\nThat has a somewhat reckless sound; but it would be palliated, if not\r\nfully justified, were we proposing, by the mere force of numbers, to\r\ndeprive you of some right plainly written down in the Constitution. But we\r\nare proposing no such thing.\r\n\r\nWhen you make these declarations, you have a specific and well-understood\r\nallusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into\r\nthe Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property. But no such\r\nright is specifically written in the Constitution. That instrument is\r\nliterally silent about any such right. We, on the contrary, deny that such\r\na right has any existence in the Constitution, even by implication.\r\n\r\nYour purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the\r\nGovernment unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution\r\nas you please on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule\r\nor ruin, in all events.\r\n\r\nThis, plainly stated, is your language. Perhaps you will say the Supreme\r\nCourt has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favor.\r\nNot quite so. But, waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and\r\ndecision, the court have decided the question for you in a sort of way.\r\nThe court have substantially said it is your constitutional right to take\r\nslaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property.\r\nWhen I say, the decision was made in a sort of way, I mean it was made\r\nin a divided court, by a bare majority of the judges, and they not quite\r\nagreeing with one another in the reasons for making it; that it is so made\r\nas that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning,\r\nand that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact--the\r\nstatement in the opinion that \"the right of property in a slave is\r\ndistinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the Constitution will show that the right of property in\r\na slave is not \"distinctly and expressly affirmed\" in it. Bear in mind,\r\nthe judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is\r\nimpliedly affirmed in the Constitution; but they pledge their veracity\r\nthat it is \"distinctly and expressly\" affirmed there--\"distinctly,\" that\r\nis, not mingled with anything else; \"expressly,\" that is, in words meaning\r\njust that, without the aid of any inference, and susceptible of no other\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nIf they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is\r\naffirmed in the instrument by implication, it would be open to others to\r\nshow that neither the word \"slave\" nor \"slavery\" is to be found in\r\nthe Constitution, nor the word \"property\" even, in any connection with\r\nlanguage alluding to the things slave or slavery; and that wherever in\r\nthat instrument the slave is alluded to, he is called a \"person\"; and\r\nwherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to, it\r\nis spoken of as \"service or labor which may be due,\" as a debt payable\r\nin service or labor. Also, it would be open to show, by contemporaneous\r\nhistory, that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery, instead of\r\nspeaking of them, was employed on purpose to exclude from the Constitution\r\nthe idea that there could be property in man.\r\n\r\nTo show all this, is easy and certain.\r\n\r\nWhen this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice,\r\nis it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken\r\nstatement, and reconsider the conclusion based upon it?\r\n\r\nAnd then it is to be remembered that \"our fathers; who framed\r\nthe Government under which we live\",--the men who made the\r\nConstitution--decided this same constitutional question in our favor,\r\nlong ago; decided it without division among themselves, when making the\r\ndecision, without division among themselves about the meaning of it after\r\nit was made, and, so far as any evidence is left, without basing it upon\r\nany mistaken statement of facts.\r\n\r\nUnder all these circumstances, do you really feel yourselves justified to\r\nbreak up this Government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be\r\nat once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action?\r\nBut you will not abide the election of a Republican President! In that\r\nsupposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say,\r\nthe great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us! That is cool. A\r\nhighwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, \"stand\r\nand deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you'll be a murderer!\"\r\n\r\nTo be sure, what the robber demanded of me-my money was my own, and I had\r\na clear right to keep it; but it was no more my own than my vote is my\r\nown; and the threat of death to me, to extort my money, and the threat of\r\ndestruction to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be distinguished\r\nin principle.\r\n\r\nA few words now to Republicans: It is exceedingly desirable that all\r\nparts of this great confederacy shall be at peace and in harmony one with\r\nanother. Let us Republicans do our part to have it so. Even though much\r\nprovoked, let us do nothing through passion and ill temper. Even though\r\nthe Southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us calmly\r\nconsider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of\r\nour duty, we possibly can. Judging by all they say and do, and by the\r\nsubject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we\r\ncan, what will satisfy them.\r\n\r\nWill they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered\r\nto them? We know they will not. In all their present complaints against\r\nus, the Territories are scarcely mentioned. Invasions and insurrections\r\nare the rage now. Will it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing\r\nto do with invasions and, insurrections? We know it will not. We so\r\nknow because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and\r\ninsurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the\r\ncharge and the denunciation.\r\n\r\nThe question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply this: We must not only\r\nlet them alone, but we must, somehow, convince them that we do let them\r\nalone. This, we know by experience, is no easy task. We have been so\r\ntrying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization, but\r\nwith no success. In all our platforms and speeches we have constantly\r\nprotested our purpose to let them alone; but this has had no tendency to\r\nconvince them. Alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they\r\nhave never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them.\r\n\r\nThese natural and apparently adequate means all failing, what will\r\nconvince them? This, and this only: cease to call slavery wrong, and join\r\nthem in calling it right. And this must be done thoroughly--done in\r\nacts as well as in words. Silence will not be tolerated--we must place\r\nourselves avowedly with them. Senator Douglas's new sedition law must be\r\nenacted and enforced, suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong,\r\nwhether made in politics, in presses, in pulpits; or in private. We must\r\narrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure. We must\r\npull down our free State constitutions. The whole atmosphere must be\r\ndisinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery, before they will\r\ncease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way. Most\r\nof them would probably say to us, \"Let us alone, do nothing to us, and\r\nsay what you please about slavery.\" But we do let them alone have never\r\ndisturbed them--so that after all it is what we say which dissatisfies\r\nthem. They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we cease saying.\r\n\r\nI am also aware they have not as yet, in terms, demanded the overthrow of\r\nour free State constitutions. Yet those constitutions declare the wrong of\r\nslavery, with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it;\r\nand when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow\r\nof these constitutions will be demanded, and nothing be left to resist the\r\ndemand. It is nothing to the contrary, that they do not demand the whole\r\nof this just now. Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do, they\r\ncan voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation. Holding, as they\r\ndo, that slavery is morally right, and socially elevating, they cannot\r\ncease to demand a full national recognition of it, as a legal right and a\r\nsocial blessing.\r\n\r\nNor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction\r\nthat slavery is wrong. If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and\r\nconstitutions against it are themselves wrong, and should be silenced and\r\nswept away. If it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality\r\nits universality; if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its\r\nextension--its enlargement. All they ask we could readily grant if we\r\nthought slavery right; all we ask they could as readily grant, if they\r\nthought it wrong. Their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the\r\nprecise fact upon which depends the whole controversy. Thinking it right,\r\nas they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition, as\r\nbeing right; but thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them? Can we\r\ncast our votes with their view, and against our own? In view of our moral,\r\nsocial, and political responsibilities, can we do this? Wrong as we think\r\nslavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is, because that\r\nmuch is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the\r\nnation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread\r\ninto the national Territories, and to overrun us here in these free\r\nStates? If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our\r\nduty, fearlessly and effectively. Let us be diverted by none of those\r\nsophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and\r\nbelabored-contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the\r\nright and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who should be neither a\r\nliving man nor a dead man-such as a policy of \"don't care\" on a question\r\nabout which all true men do care--such as Union appeals beseeching\r\ntrue Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule,\r\nand calling, not the sinners, but the righteous to repentance--such as\r\ninvocations to Washington, imploring men to unsay what Washington said,\r\nand undo what Washington did.\r\n\r\nNeither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us,\r\nnor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government nor of\r\ndungeons to ourselves. LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT, AND IN\r\nTHAT FAITH LET US, TO THE END, DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT, MARCH 6, 1860\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF NEW HAVEN:--If the Republican\r\nparty of this nation shall ever have the national House entrusted to its\r\nkeeping, it will be the duty of that party to attend to all the affairs\r\nof national housekeeping. Whatever matters of importance may come up,\r\nwhatever difficulties may arise in its way of administration of the\r\nGovernment, that party will then have to attend to. It will then be\r\ncompelled to attend to other questions, besides this question which now\r\nassumes an overwhelming importance--the question of slavery. It is true\r\nthat in the organization of the Republican party this question of slavery\r\nwas more important than any other: indeed, so much more important has\r\nit become that no more national question can even get a hearing just at\r\npresent. The old question of tariff--a matter that will remain one of the\r\nchief affairs of national house-keeping to all time; the question of the\r\nmanagement of financial affairs; the question of the disposition of the\r\npublic domain how shall it be managed for the purpose of getting it well\r\nsettled, and of making there the homes of a free and happy people? these\r\nwill remain open and require attention for a great while yet, and these\r\nquestions will have to be attended to by whatever party has the control of\r\nthe Government. Yet, just now, they cannot even obtain a hearing, and I do\r\nnot propose to detain you upon these topics or what sort of hearing they\r\nshould have when opportunity shall come.\r\n\r\nFor, whether we will or not, the question of slavery is the question, the\r\nall-absorbing topic of the day. It is true that all of us--and by that I\r\nmean, not the Republican party alone, but the whole American people, here\r\nand elsewhere--all of us wish this question settled, wish it out of the\r\nway. It stands in the way, and prevents the adjustment, and the giving\r\nof necessary attention to other questions of national house-keeping. The\r\npeople of the whole nation agree that this question ought to be settled,\r\nand yet it is not settled. And the reason is that they are not yet agreed\r\nhow it shall be settled. All wish it done, but some wish one way and\r\nsome another, and some a third, or fourth, or fifth; different bodies\r\nare pulling in different directions, and none of them, having a decided\r\nmajority, are able to accomplish the common object.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1854, a new policy was inaugurated with the\r\navowed object and confident promise that it would entirely and forever\r\nput an end to the slavery agitation. It was again and again declared that\r\nunder this policy, when once successfully established, the country would\r\nbe forever rid of this whole question. Yet under the operation of that\r\npolicy this agitation has not only not ceased, but it has been constantly\r\naugmented. And this too, although, from the day of its introduction, its\r\nfriends, who promised that it would wholly end all agitation, constantly\r\ninsisted, down to the time that the Lecompton Bill was introduced, that it\r\nwas working admirably, and that its inevitable tendency was to remove the\r\nquestion forever from the politics of the country. Can you call to mind\r\nany Democratic speech, made after the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,\r\ndown to the time of the Lecompton Bill, in which it was not predicted that\r\nthe slavery agitation was just at an end, that \"the abolition excitement\r\nwas played out,\" \"the Kansas question was dead,\" \"they have made the most\r\nthey can out of this question and it is now forever settled\"? But since\r\nthe Lecompton Bill no Democrat, within my experience, has ever pretended\r\nthat he could see the end. That cry has been dropped. They themselves do\r\nnot pretend, now, that the agitation of this subject has come to an end\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that this question is one of national importance, and we\r\ncannot help dealing with it; we must do something about it, whether\r\nwe will or not. We cannot avoid it; the subject is one we cannot avoid\r\nconsidering; we can no more avoid it than a man can live without eating.\r\nIt is upon us; it attaches to the body politic as much and closely as the\r\nnatural wants attach to our natural bodies. Now I think it important that\r\nthis matter should be taken up in earnest, and really settled: And one way\r\nto bring about a true settlement of the question is to understand its true\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nThere have been many efforts made to settle it. Again and again it has\r\nbeen fondly hoped that it was settled; but every time it breaks out\r\nafresh, and more violently than ever. It was settled, our fathers\r\nhoped, by the Missouri Compromise, but it did not stay settled. Then the\r\ncompromises of 1850 were declared to be a full and final settlement of\r\nthe question. The two great parties, each in national convention, adopted\r\nresolutions declaring that the settlement made by the Compromise of 1850\r\nwas a finality that it would last forever. Yet how long before it was\r\nunsettled again? It broke out again in 1854, and blazed higher and raged\r\nmore furiously than ever before, and the agitation has not rested since.\r\n\r\nThese repeated settlements must have some faults about them. There must\r\nbe some inadequacy in their very nature to the purpose to which they were\r\ndesigned. We can only speculate as to where that fault, that inadequacy,\r\nis, but we may perhaps profit by past experiences.\r\n\r\nI think that one of the causes of these repeated failures is that our best\r\nand greatest men have greatly underestimated the size of this question.\r\nThey have constantly brought forward small cures for great sores--plasters\r\ntoo small to cover the wound. That is one reason that all settlements have\r\nproved temporary--so evanescent.\r\n\r\nLook at the magnitude of this subject: One sixth of our population, in\r\nround numbers--not quite one sixth, and yet more than a seventh,--about\r\none sixth of the whole population of the United States are slaves. The\r\nowners of these slaves consider them property. The effect upon the minds\r\nof the owners is that of property, and nothing else it induces them to\r\ninsist upon all that will favorably affect its value as property, to\r\ndemand laws and institutions and a public policy that shall increase and\r\nsecure its value, and make it durable, lasting, and universal. The effect\r\non the minds of the owners is to persuade them that there is no wrong\r\nin it. The slaveholder does not like to be considered a mean fellow for\r\nholding that species of property, and hence, he has to struggle within\r\nhimself and sets about arguing himself into the belief that slavery is\r\nright. The property influences his mind. The dissenting minister who\r\nargued some theological point with one of the established church was\r\nalways met with the reply, \"I can't see it so.\" He opened a Bible and\r\npointed him a passage, but the orthodox minister replied, \"I can't see\r\nit so.\" Then he showed him a single word--\"Can you see that?\" \"Yes, I see\r\nit,\" was the reply. The dissenter laid a guinea over the word and asked,\r\n\"Do you see it now?\" So here. Whether the owners of this species of\r\nproperty do really see it as it is, it is not for me to say, but if they\r\ndo, they see it as it is through two thousand millions of dollars, and\r\nthat is a pretty thick coating. Certain it is that they do not see it\r\nas we see it. Certain it is that this two thousand millions of dollars,\r\ninvested in this species of property, all so concentrated that the mind\r\ncan grasp it at once--this immense pecuniary interest--has its influence\r\nupon their minds.\r\n\r\nBut here in Connecticut and at the North slavery does not exist, and we\r\nsee it through no such medium.\r\n\r\nTo us it appears natural to think that slaves are human beings; men,\r\nnot property; that some of the things, at least, stated about men in\r\nthe Declaration of Independence apply to them as well as to us. I say we\r\nthink, most of us, that this charter of freedom applies to the slaves as\r\nwell as to ourselves; that the class of arguments put forward to batter\r\ndown that idea are also calculated to break down the very idea of a free\r\ngovernment, even for white men, and to undermine the very foundations of\r\nfree society. We think slavery a great moral wrong, and, while we do not\r\nclaim the right to touch it where it exists, we wish to treat it as a\r\nwrong in the Territories, where our votes will reach it. We think that\r\na respect for ourselves, a regard for future generations and for the God\r\nthat made us, require that we put down this wrong where our votes will\r\nproperly reach it. We think that species of labor an injury to free white\r\nmen--in short, we think slavery a great moral, social, and political\r\nevil, tolerable only because, and so far as, its actual existence makes it\r\nnecessary to tolerate it, and that beyond that it ought to be treated as a\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nNow these two ideas, the property idea that slavery is right, and the\r\nidea that it is wrong, come into collision, and do actually produce that\r\nirrepressible conflict which Mr. Seward has been so roundly abused for\r\nmentioning. The two ideas conflict, and must conflict.\r\n\r\nAgain, in its political aspect, does anything in any way endanger the\r\nperpetuity of this Union but that single thing, slavery? Many of our\r\nadversaries are anxious to claim that they are specially devoted to the\r\nUnion, and take pains to charge upon us hostility to the Union. Now we\r\nclaim that we are the only true Union men, and we put to them this one\r\nproposition: Whatever endangers this Union, save and except slavery? Did\r\nany other thing ever cause a moment's fear? All men must agree that this\r\nthing alone has ever endangered the perpetuity of the Union. But if it\r\nwas threatened by any other influence, would not all men say that the\r\nbest thing that could be done, if we could not or ought not to destroy it,\r\nwould be at least to keep it from growing any larger? Can any man believe,\r\nthat the way to save the Union is to extend and increase the only thing\r\nthat threatens the Union, and to suffer it to grow bigger and bigger?\r\n\r\nWhenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some\r\nphilosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical\r\nopinion can be permanently maintained. And hence there are but two\r\npolicies in regard to slavery that can be at all maintained. The first,\r\nbased on the property view that slavery is right, conforms to that idea\r\nthroughout, and demands that we shall do everything for it that we ought\r\nto do if it were right. We must sweep away all opposition, for opposition\r\nto the right is wrong; we must agree that slavery is right, and we must\r\nadopt the idea that property has persuaded the owner to believe\r\nthat slavery is morally right and socially elevating. This gives a\r\nphilosophical basis for a permanent policy of encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe other policy is one that squares with the idea that slavery is wrong,\r\nand it consists in doing everything that we ought to do if it is wrong.\r\nNow, I don't wish to be misunderstood, nor to leave a gap down to be\r\nmisrepresented, even. I don't mean that we ought to attack it where it\r\nexists. To me it seems that if we were to form a government anew, in view\r\nof the actual presence of slavery we should find it necessary to frame\r\njust such a government as our fathers did--giving to the slaveholder the\r\nentire control where the system was established, while we possessed the\r\npower to restrain it from going outside those limits. From the necessities\r\nof the case we should be compelled to form just such a government as our\r\nblessed fathers gave us; and, surely, if they have so made it, that adds\r\nanother reason why we should let slavery alone where it exists.\r\n\r\nIf I saw a venomous snake crawling in the road, any man would say I might\r\nseize the nearest stick and kill it; but if I found that snake in bed with\r\nmy children, that would be another question. I might hurt the children\r\nmore than the snake, and it might bite them. Much more if I found it\r\nin bed with my neighbor's children, and I had bound myself by a solemn\r\ncompact not to meddle with his children under any circumstances, it would\r\nbecome me to let that particular mode of getting rid of the gentleman\r\nalone. But if there was a bed newly made up, to which the children were to\r\nbe taken, and it was proposed to take a batch of young snakes and put them\r\nthere with them, I take it no man would say there was any question how I\r\nought to decide!\r\n\r\nThat is just the case. The new Territories are the newly made bed to which\r\nour children are to go, and it lies with the nation to say whether they\r\nshall have snakes mixed up with them or not. It does not seem as if there\r\ncould be much hesitation what our policy should be!\r\n\r\nNow I have spoken of a policy based on the idea that slavery is wrong, and\r\na policy based on the idea that it is right. But an effort has been made\r\nfor a policy that shall treat it as neither right nor wrong. It is based\r\nupon utter indifference. Its leading advocate [Douglas] has said, \"I don't\r\ncare whether it be voted up or down.\" \"It is merely a matter of dollars\r\nand cents.\" \"The Almighty has drawn a line across this continent, on one\r\nside of which all soil must forever be cultivated by slave labor, and on\r\nthe other by free.\" \"When the struggle is between the white man and\r\nthe negro, I am for the white man; when it is between the negro and the\r\ncrocodile, I am for the negro.\" Its central idea is indifference. It holds\r\nthat it makes no more difference to us whether the Territories become\r\nfree or slave States than whether my neighbor stocks his farm with horned\r\ncattle or puts in tobacco. All recognize this policy, the plausible\r\nsugar-coated name of which is \"popular sovereignty.\"\r\n\r\nThis policy chiefly stands in the way of a permanent settlement of the\r\nquestion. I believe there is no danger of its becoming the permanent\r\npolicy of the country, for it is based on a public indifference. There is\r\nnobody that \"don't care.\" All the people do care one way or the other! I\r\ndo not charge that its author, when he says he \"don't care,\" states his\r\nindividual opinion; he only expresses his policy for the government. I\r\nunderstand that he has never said as an individual whether he thought\r\nslavery right or wrong--and he is the only man in the nation that has not!\r\nNow such a policy may have a temporary run; it may spring up as necessary\r\nto the political prospects of some gentleman; but it is utterly baseless:\r\nthe people are not indifferent, and it can therefore have no durability or\r\npermanence.\r\n\r\nBut suppose it could: Then it could be maintained only by a public opinion\r\nthat shall say, \"We don't care.\" There must be a change in public opinion;\r\nthe public mind must be so far debauched as to square with this policy\r\nof caring not at all. The people must come to consider this as \"merely\r\na question of dollars and cents,\" and to believe that in some places the\r\nAlmighty has made slavery necessarily eternal. This policy can be brought\r\nto prevail if the people can be brought round to say honestly, \"We don't\r\ncare\"; if not, it can never be maintained. It is for you to say whether\r\nthat can be done.\r\n\r\nYou are ready to say it cannot, but be not too fast! Remember what a long\r\nstride has been taken since the repeal of the Missouri Compromise! Do you\r\nknow of any Democrat, of either branch of the party--do you know one who\r\ndeclares that he believes that the Declaration of Independence has any\r\napplication to the negro? Judge Taney declares that it has not, and Judge\r\nDouglas even vilifies me personally and scolds me roundly for saying that\r\nthe Declaration applies to all men, and that negroes are men. Is there a\r\nDemocrat here who does not deny that the Declaration applies to the\r\nnegro? Do any of you know of one? Well, I have tried before perhaps\r\nfifty audiences, some larger and some smaller than this, to find one such\r\nDemocrat, and never yet have I found one who said I did not place him\r\nright in that. I must assume that Democrats hold that, and now, not one\r\nof these Democrats can show that he said that five years ago! I venture to\r\ndefy the whole party to produce one man that ever uttered the belief\r\nthat the Declaration did not apply to negroes, before the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise! Four or five years ago we all thought negroes were\r\nmen, and that when \"all men\" were named, negroes were included. But the\r\nwhole Democratic party has deliberately taken negroes from the class of\r\nmen and put them in the class of brutes. Turn it as you will it is simply\r\nthe truth! Don't be too hasty, then, in saying that the people cannot be\r\nbrought to this new doctrine, but note that long stride. One more as long\r\ncompletes the journey from where negroes are estimated as men to where\r\nthey are estimated as mere brutes--as rightful property!\r\n\r\nThat saying \"In the struggle between white men and the negro,\" etc., which\r\nI know came from the same source as this policy--that saying marks another\r\nstep. There is a falsehood wrapped up in that statement. \"In the struggle\r\nbetween the white man and the negro\" assumes that there is a struggle,\r\nin which either the white man must enslave the negro or the negro must\r\nenslave the white. There is no such struggle! It is merely the ingenious\r\nfalsehood to degrade and brutalize the negro. Let each let the other\r\nalone, and there is no struggle about it. If it was like two wrecked\r\nseamen on a narrow plank, when each must push the other off or drown\r\nhimself, I would push the negro off or a white man either, but it is not;\r\nthe plank is large enough for both. This good earth is plenty broad enough\r\nfor white man and negro both, and there is no need of either pushing the\r\nother off.\r\n\r\nSo that saying, \"In the struggle between the negro and the crocodile,\"\r\netc., is made up from the idea that down where the crocodile inhabits, a\r\nwhite man can't labor; it must be nothing else but crocodile or negro; if\r\nthe negro does not the crocodile must possess the earth; in that case he\r\ndeclares for the negro. The meaning of the whole is just this: As a white\r\nman is to a negro, so is a negro to a crocodile; and as the negro may\r\nrightfully treat the crocodile, so may the white man rightfully treat the\r\nnegro. This very dear phrase coined by its author, and so dear that he\r\ndeliberately repeats it in many speeches, has a tendency to still further\r\nbrutalize the negro, and to bring public opinion to the point of utter\r\nindifference whether men so brutalized are enslaved or not. When that time\r\nshall come, if ever, I think that policy to which I refer may prevail. But\r\nI hope the good freemen of this country will never allow it to come, and\r\nuntil then the policy can never be maintained.\r\n\r\nNow consider the effect of this policy. We in the States are not to\r\ncare whether freedom or slavery gets the better, but the people in the\r\nTerritories may care. They are to decide, and they may think what they\r\nplease; it is a matter of dollars and cents! But are not the people of the\r\nTerritories detailed from the States? If this feeling of indifference this\r\nabsence of moral sense about the question prevails in the States, will\r\nit not be carried into the Territories? Will not every man say, \"I don't\r\ncare, it is nothing to me\"? If any one comes that wants slavery, must they\r\nnot say, \"I don't care whether freedom or slavery be voted up or voted\r\ndown\"? It results at last in nationalizing the institution of slavery.\r\nEven if fairly carried out, that policy is just as certain to nationalize\r\nslavery as the doctrine of Jeff Davis himself. These are only two roads\r\nto the same goal, and \"popular sovereignty\" is just as sure and almost as\r\nshort as the other.\r\n\r\nWhat we want, and all we want, is to have with us the men who think\r\nslavery wrong. But those who say they hate slavery, and are opposed to it,\r\nbut yet act with the Democratic party--where are they? Let us apply a\r\nfew tests. You say that you think slavery is wrong, but you denounce all\r\nattempts to restrain it. Is there anything else that you think wrong that\r\nyou are not willing to deal with as wrong? Why are you so careful, so\r\ntender, of this one wrong and no other? You will not let us do a single\r\nthing as if it was wrong; there is no place where you will even allow it\r\nto be called wrong! We must not call it wrong in the free States, because\r\nit is not there, and we must not call it wrong in the slave States,\r\nbecause it is there; we must not call it wrong in politics because that\r\nis bringing morality into politics, and we must not call it wrong in the\r\npulpit because that is bringing politics into religion; we must not bring\r\nit into the Tract Society or the other societies, because those are such\r\nunsuitable places--and there is no single place, according to you, where\r\nthis wrong thing can properly be called wrong!\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will plead that if the people of the slave States should\r\nthemselves set on foot an effort for emancipation, you would wish\r\nthem success, and bid them God-speed. Let us test that: In 1858 the\r\nemancipation party of Missouri, with Frank Blair at their head, tried to\r\nget up a movement for that purpose, and having started a party contested\r\nthe State. Blair was beaten, apparently if not truly, and when the news\r\ncame to Connecticut, you, who knew that Frank Blair was taking hold of\r\nthis thing by the right end, and doing the only thing that you say can\r\nproperly be done to remove this wrong--did you bow your heads in sorrow\r\nbecause of that defeat? Do you, any of you, know one single Democrat that\r\nshowed sorrow over that result? Not one! On the contrary every man threw\r\nup his hat, and hallooed at the top of his lungs, \"Hooray for Democracy!\"\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, the Republicans desire to place this great question of\r\nslavery on the very basis on which our fathers placed it, and no other. It\r\nis easy to demonstrate that \"our fathers, who framed this Government\r\nunder which we live,\" looked on slavery as wrong, and so framed it and\r\neverything about it as to square with the idea that it was wrong, so far\r\nas the necessities arising from its existence permitted. In forming the\r\nConstitution they found the slave trade existing, capital invested in it,\r\nfields depending upon it for labor, and the whole system resting upon\r\nthe importation of slave labor. They therefore did not prohibit the slave\r\ntrade at once, but they gave the power to prohibit it after twenty years.\r\nWhy was this? What other foreign trade did they treat in that way? Would\r\nthey have done this if they had not thought slavery wrong?\r\n\r\nAnother thing was done by some of the same men who framed the\r\nConstitution, and afterwards adopted as their own the act by the first\r\nCongress held under that Constitution, of which many of the framers were\r\nmembers, that prohibited the spread of slavery into Territories. Thus\r\nthe same men, the framers of the Constitution, cut off the supply and\r\nprohibited the spread of slavery, and both acts show conclusively that\r\nthey considered that the thing was wrong.\r\n\r\nIf additional proof is wanted it can be found in the phraseology of the\r\nConstitution. When men are framing a supreme law and chart of government,\r\nto secure blessings and prosperity to untold generations yet to come, they\r\nuse language as short and direct and plain as can be found, to express\r\ntheir meaning In all matters but this of slavery the framers of the\r\nConstitution used the very clearest, shortest, and most direct language.\r\nBut the Constitution alludes to slavery three times without mentioning it\r\nonce The language used becomes ambiguous, roundabout, and mystical. They\r\nspeak of the \"immigration of persons,\" and mean the importation of slaves,\r\nbut do not say so. In establishing a basis of representation they say \"all\r\nother persons,\" when they mean to say slaves--why did they not use\r\nthe shortest phrase? In providing for the return of fugitives they say\r\n\"persons held to service or labor.\" If they had said slaves it would have\r\nbeen plainer, and less liable to misconstruction. Why did n't they do it?\r\nWe cannot doubt that it was done on purpose. Only one reason is possible,\r\nand that is supplied us by one of the framers of the Constitution--and\r\nit is not possible for man to conceive of any other--they expected and\r\ndesired that the system would come to an end, and meant that when it did,\r\nthe Constitution should not show that there ever had been a slave in this\r\ngood free country of ours.\r\n\r\nI will dwell on that no longer. I see the signs of approaching triumph\r\nof the Republicans in the bearing of their political adversaries. A great\r\ndeal of their war with us nowadays is mere bushwhacking. At the battle\r\nof Waterloo, when Napoleon's cavalry had charged again and again upon\r\nthe unbroken squares of British infantry, at last they were giving up\r\nthe attempt, and going off in disorder, when some of the officers in mere\r\nvexation and complete despair fired their pistols at those solid squares.\r\nThe Democrats are in that sort of extreme desperation; it is nothing else.\r\nI will take up a few of these arguments.\r\n\r\nThere is \"the irrepressible conflict.\" How they rail at Seward for that\r\nsaying! They repeat it constantly; and, although the proof has been thrust\r\nunder their noses again and again that almost every good man since the\r\nformation of our Government has uttered that same sentiment, from General\r\nWashington, who \"trusted that we should yet have a confederacy of free\r\nStates,\" with Jefferson, Jay, Monroe, down to the latest days, yet they\r\nrefuse to notice that at all, and persist in railing at Seward for saying\r\nit. Even Roger A. Pryor, editor of the Richmond Enquirer, uttered the same\r\nsentiment in almost the same language, and yet so little offence did\r\nit give the Democrats that he was sent for to Washington to edit the\r\nStates--the Douglas organ there--while Douglas goes into hydrophobia and\r\nspasms of rage because Seward dared to repeat it. This is what I call\r\nbushwhacking, a sort of argument that they must know any child can see\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nAnother is John Brown: \"You stir up insurrections, you invade the South;\r\nJohn Brown! Harper's Ferry!\" Why, John Brown was not a Republican!\r\nYou have never implicated a single Republican in that Harper's Ferry\r\nenterprise. We tell you that if any member of the Republican party is\r\nguilty in that matter, you know it or you do not know it. If you do know\r\nit, you are inexcusable not to designate the man and prove the fact. If\r\nyou do not know it, you are inexcusable to assert it, and especially\r\nto persist in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the\r\nproof. You need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does\r\nnot know to be true is simply malicious slander. Some of you admit that no\r\nRepublican designedly aided or encouraged the Harper's Ferry affair, but\r\nstill insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such\r\nresults. We do not believe it. We know we hold to no doctrines, and make\r\nno declarations, which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed\r\nthe Government 'under which we live, and we cannot see how declarations\r\nthat were patriotic when they made them are villainous when we make them.\r\nYou never dealt fairly by us in relation to that affair--and I will say\r\nfrankly that I know of nothing in your character that should lead us to\r\nsuppose that you would. You had just been soundly thrashed in elections\r\nin several States, and others were soon to come. You rejoiced at the\r\noccasion, and only were troubled that there were not three times as many\r\nkilled in the affair. You were in evident glee; there was no sorrow for\r\nthe killed nor for the peace of Virginia disturbed; you were rejoicing\r\nthat by charging Republicans with this thing you might get an advantage of\r\nus in New York, and the other States. You pulled that string as tightly as\r\nyou could, but your very generous and worthy expectations were not quite\r\nfulfilled. Each Republican knew that the charge was a slander as to\r\nhimself at least, and was not inclined by it to cast his vote in your\r\nfavor. It was mere bushwhacking, because you had nothing else to do. You\r\nare still on that track, and I say, go on! If you think you can slander\r\na woman into loving you or a man into voting for you, try it till you are\r\nsatisfied!\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of this bushwhacking, that \"shoe strike.\" Now be it\r\nunderstood that I do not pretend to know all about the matter. I am merely\r\ngoing to speculate a little about some of its phases. And at the outset, I\r\nam glad to see that a system of labor prevails in New England under which\r\nlaborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to\r\nwork under all circumstances, and are not tied down and obliged to labor\r\nwhether you pay them or not! I like the system which lets a man quit when\r\nhe wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere. One of the reasons why\r\nI am opposed to slavery is just here. What is the true condition of the\r\nlaborer? I take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to\r\nacquire property as fast as he can. Some will get wealthy. I don't believe\r\nin a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than\r\ngood. So, while we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to\r\nallow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else.\r\nWhen one starts poor, as most do in the race of life, free society is such\r\nthat he knows he can better his condition; he knows that there is no fixed\r\ncondition of labor for his whole life. I am not ashamed to confess that\r\ntwenty-five years ago I was a hired laborer, mauling rails, at work on a\r\nflatboat--just what might happen to any poor man's son! I want every man\r\nto have a chance--and I believe a Black man is entitled to it--in which he\r\ncan better his condition; when he may look forward and hope to be a hired\r\nlaborer this year and the next, work for himself afterward, and finally to\r\nhire men to work for him! That is the system. Up here in New England, you\r\nhave a soil that scarcely sprouts black-eyed beans, and yet where will you\r\nfind wealthy men so wealthy, and poverty so rarely in extremity? There is\r\nnot another such place on earth! I desire that if you get too thick here,\r\nand find it hard to better your condition on this soil, you may have a\r\nchance to strike and go somewhere else, where you may not be degraded, nor\r\nhave your families corrupted, by forced rivalry with negro slaves. I want\r\nyou to have a clean bed and no snakes in it! Then you can better your\r\ncondition, and so it may go on and on in one endless round so long as man\r\nexists on the face of the earth!\r\n\r\nNow, to come back to this shoe strike,--if, as the senator from Illinois\r\nasserts, this is caused by withdrawal of Southern votes, consider\r\nbriefly how you will meet the difficulty. You have done nothing, and have\r\nprotested that you have done nothing, to injure the South. And yet, to get\r\nback the shoe trade, you must leave off doing something which you are\r\nnow doing. What is it? You must stop thinking slavery wrong! Let your\r\ninstitutions be wholly changed; let your State constitutions be subverted;\r\nglorify slavery, and so you will get back the shoe trade--for what? You\r\nhave brought owned labor with it, to compete with your own labor, to\r\nunderwork you, and to degrade you! Are you ready to get back the trade on\r\nthose terms?\r\n\r\nBut the statement is not correct. You have not lost that trade; orders\r\nwere never better than now! Senator Mason, a Democrat, comes into the\r\nSenate in homespun, a proof that the dissolution of the Union has actually\r\nbegun! but orders are the same. Your factories have not struck work,\r\nneither those where they make anything for coats, nor for pants nor\r\nfor shirts, nor for ladies' dresses. Mr. Mason has not reached the\r\nmanufacturers who ought to have made him a coat and pants! To make his\r\nproof good for anything he should have come into the Senate barefoot!\r\n\r\nAnother bushwhacking contrivance; simply that, nothing else! I find a good\r\nmany people who are very much concerned about the loss of Southern trade.\r\nNow either these people are sincere or they are not. I will speculate a\r\nlittle about that. If they are sincere, and are moved by any real danger\r\nof the loss of Southern trade, they will simply get their names on the\r\nwhite list, and then, instead of persuading Republicans to do likewise,\r\nthey will be glad to keep you away! Don't you see that they cut off\r\ncompetition? They would not be whispering around to Republicans to come\r\nin and share the profits with them. But if they are not sincere, and are\r\nmerely trying to fool Republicans out of their votes, they will grow very\r\nanxious about your pecuniary prospects; they are afraid you are going to\r\nget broken up and ruined; they do not care about Democratic votes, oh, no,\r\nno, no! You must judge which class those belong to whom you meet: I leave\r\nit to you to determine from the facts.\r\n\r\nLet us notice some more of the stale charges against Republicans. You say\r\nwe are sectional. We deny it. That makes an issue; and the burden of proof\r\nis upon you. You produce your proof; and what is it? Why, that our party\r\nhas no existence in your section--gets no votes in your section. The fact\r\nis substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If it does, then in\r\ncase we should, without change of principle, begin to get votes in your\r\nsection, we should thereby cease to be sectional. You cannot escape this\r\nconclusion; and yet, are you willing to abide by it? If you are, you will\r\nprobably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional, for we shall get\r\nvotes in your section this very year. The fact that we get no votes in\r\nyour section is a fact of your making and not of ours. And if there be\r\nfault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours, and remains so until\r\nyou show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice. If we\r\n ours; but this brings you to where you ought to have started--to a\r\ndiscussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If our principle, put\r\nin practice, would wrong your section for the benefit of ours, or for any\r\nother object, then our principle, and we with it, are sectional, and are\r\njustly opposed and denounced as such. Meet us, then, on the question of\r\nwhether our principle put in practice would wrong your section; and so\r\nmeet it as if it were possible that something may be said on our side. Do\r\nyou accept the challenge? No? Then you really believe that the principle\r\nwhich our fathers who framed the Government under which we live thought so\r\nclearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and again, upon their\r\nofficial oaths, is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand our condemnation\r\nwithout a moment's consideration. Some of you delight to flaunt in our\r\nfaces the warning against sectional parties given by Washington in his\r\nFarewell Address. Less than eight years before Washington gave that\r\nwarning, he had, as President of the United States, approved and signed an\r\nact of Congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern\r\nTerritory, which act embodied the policy of government upon that subject,\r\nup to and at the very moment he penned that warning; and about one year\r\nafter he penned it he wrote La Fayette that he considered that prohibition\r\na wise measure, expressing in the same connection his hope that we should\r\nsometime have a confederacy of free States.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon\r\nthis same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or\r\nin our hands against you? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast\r\nthe blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon\r\nyou, who repudiate it? We respect that warning of Washington, and we\r\ncommend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right\r\napplication of it.\r\n\r\nBut you say you are conservative--eminently conservative--while we\r\nare revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort. What is\r\nconservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new\r\nand untried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the\r\npoint in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the\r\nGovernment under which we live; while you with one accord reject and scout\r\nand spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new.\r\n\r\nTrue, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be.\r\nYou have considerable variety of new propositions and plans, but you are\r\nunanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some\r\nof you are for reviving the foreign slave-trade; some for a congressional\r\nslave code for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the\r\nTerritories to prohibit slavery within their limits; some for maintaining\r\nslavery in the Territories through the judiciary; some for the \"gur-reat\r\npur-rinciple\" that if one man would enslave another, no third man should\r\nobject--fantastically called \"popular sovereignty.\" But never a man among\r\nyou in favor of prohibition of slavery in Federal Territories, according\r\nto the practice of our fathers who framed the Government under which\r\nwe live. Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an\r\nadvocate in the century within which our Government originated. And yet\r\nyou draw yourselves up and say, \"We are eminently conservative.\"\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall\r\nbe at peace, and in harmony one with another. Let us Republicans do our\r\npart to have it so. Even though much provoked, let us do nothing through\r\npassion and ill-temper. Even though the Southern people will not so much\r\nas listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them\r\nif, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can. Judging by all\r\nthey say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with\r\nus, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them.\r\n\r\nWill they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered\r\nto them? We know they will not. In all their present complaints against\r\nus, the Territories are scarcely mentioned. Invasions and insurrections\r\nare the rage now. Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing\r\nto do with invasions and insurrections? We know it will not. We so\r\nknow because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and\r\ninsurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the\r\ncharge and the denunciation.\r\n\r\nThe question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply this: we must not only\r\nlet them alone, but we must, somehow, convince them that we do let them\r\nalone. This, we know by experience, is no easy task. We have been so\r\ntrying to convince them, from the very beginning of our organization, but\r\nwith no success. In all our platforms and speeches, we have constantly\r\nprotested our purpose to let them alone; but this had no tendency to\r\nconvince them. Alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they\r\nhave never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them.\r\n\r\nThese natural and apparently adequate means all failing, what will\r\nconvince them? This, and this only: cease to call slavery wrong, and join\r\nthem in calling it right. And this must be done thoroughly--done in\r\nacts as well as in words. Silence will not be tolerated--we must place\r\nourselves avowedly with them. Douglas's new sedition law must be enacted\r\nand enforced, suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong, whether\r\nmade in politics, in presses, in pulpits, or in private. We must arrest\r\nand return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure. We must pull down\r\nour free State constitutions. The whole atmosphere must be disinfected of\r\nall taint of opposition to slavery, before they will cease to believe\r\nthat all their troubles proceed from us. So long as we call slavery wrong,\r\nwhenever a slave runs away they will overlook the obvious fact that he ran\r\naway because he was oppressed, and declare he was stolen off. Whenever\r\na master cuts his slaves with a lash, and they cry out under it, he will\r\noverlook the obvious fact that the negroes cry out because they are hurt,\r\nand insist that they were put up to it by some rascally abolitionist.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware that they do not state their case precisely in this way.\r\nMost of them would probably say to us, \"Let us alone, do nothing to us,\r\nand say what you please about slavery.\" But we do let them alone--have\r\nnever disturbed them--so that, after all, it is what we say which\r\ndissatisfies them. They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we\r\ncease saying.\r\n\r\nI am also aware that they have not as yet in terms demanded the overthrow\r\nof our free-State constitutions. Yet those constitutions declare the wrong\r\nof slavery with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it;\r\nand when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow\r\nof these constitutions will be demanded. It is nothing to the contrary\r\nthat they do not demand the whole of this just now. Demanding what they\r\ndo, and for the reason they do, they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of\r\nthis consummation. Holding as they do that slavery is morally right,\r\nand socially elevating, they cannot cease to demand a full national\r\nrecognition of it, as a legal right, and a social blessing.\r\n\r\nNor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction\r\nthat slavery is wrong. If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and\r\nconstitutions against it are themselves wrong and should be silenced\r\nand swept away. If it is right, we cannot justly object to its\r\nnationality--its universality: if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist\r\nupon its extension--its enlargement. All they ask, we could readily grant,\r\nif we thought slavery right; all we ask, they could as readily grant, if\r\nthey thought it wrong. Their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong\r\nis the precise fact on which depends the whole controversy. Thinking it\r\nright as they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition,\r\nas being right; but, thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them?\r\nCan we cast our votes with their view, and against our own? In view of our\r\nmoral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?\r\n\r\nWrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where\r\nit is because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual\r\npresence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow\r\nit to spread into the national Territories, and to overrun us here in\r\nthese free States?\r\n\r\nIf our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty,\r\nfearlessly and effectively. Let us be diverted by none of those\r\nsophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and\r\nbelabored--contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the\r\nright and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who would be neither a\r\nliving man nor a dead man--such as a policy of \"don't care\" on a question\r\nabout which all free men do care--such as Union appeals beseeching true\r\nUnion men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and caning,\r\nnot the sinners, but the righteous to repentance--such as invocations of\r\nWashington, imploring men to unsay what Washington did.\r\n\r\nNeither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us,\r\nnor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government, nor\r\nof dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might; and in\r\nthat faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.\r\n\r\n[As Mr. Lincoln concluded his address, there was witnessed the wildest\r\nscene of enthusiasm and excitement that has been in New Haven for years.\r\nThe Palladium editorially says: \"We give up most of our space to-day to\r\na very full report of the eloquent speech of the HON. Abraham Lincoln, of\r\nIllinois, delivered last night at Union Hall.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO AN ELECTOR'S REQUEST FOR MONEY\r\n\r\nTO ------------ March 16, 1860\r\n\r\nAs to your kind wishes for myself, allow me to say I cannot enter the ring\r\non the money basis--first, because in the main it is wrong; and secondly,\r\nI have not and cannot get the money.\r\n\r\nI say, in the main, the use of money is wrong; but for certain objects in\r\na political contest, the use of some is both right and indispensable. With\r\nme, as with yourself, the long struggle has been one of great pecuniary\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nI now distinctly say this--if you shall be appointed a delegate to\r\nChicago, I will furnish one hundred dollars to bear the expenses of the\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

SOMERS, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Reaching home three days ago, I found your letter of February\r\n26th. Considering your difficulty of hearing, I think you had better\r\nsettle in Chicago, if, as you say, a good man already in fair practice\r\nthere will take you into partnership. If you had not that difficulty, I\r\nstill should think it an even balance whether you would not better remain\r\nin Chicago, with such a chance for copartnership.\r\n\r\nIf I went west, I think I would go to Kansas, to Leavenworth or Atchison.\r\nBoth of them are and will continue to be fine growing places.\r\n\r\nI believe I have said all I can, and I have said it with the deepest\r\ninterest for your welfare.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCUSATION OF HAVING BEEN PAID FOR A POLITICAL SPEECH\r\n\r\nTO C. F. McNEIL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, April 6, 1860\r\n\r\nC. F. MCNEIL, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Reaching home yesterday, I found yours of the 23d March,\r\ninclosing a slip from The Middleport Press. It is not true that I ever\r\ncharged anything for a political speech in my life; but this much is true:\r\nLast October I was requested by letter to deliver some sort of speech in\r\nMr. Beecher's church, in Brooklyn--two hundred dollars being offered in\r\nthe first letter. I wrote that I could do it in February, provided they\r\nwould take a political speech if I could find time to get up no other.\r\nThey agreed; and subsequently I informed them the speech would have to\r\nbe a political one. When I reached New York, I for the first time learned\r\nthat the place was changed to \"Cooper Institute.\" I made the speech, and\r\nleft for New Hampshire, where I have a son at school, neither asking for\r\npay nor having any offered me. Three days after a check for two hundred\r\ndollars was sent to me at New Hampshire; and I took it, and did not know\r\nit was wrong. My understanding now is--though I knew nothing of it at the\r\ntime--that they did charge for admittance to the Cooper Institute, and\r\nthat they took in more than twice two hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nI have made this explanation to you as a friend; but I wish no explanation\r\nmade to our enemies. What they want is a squabble and a fuss, and that\r\nthey can have if we explain; and they cannot have it if we don't.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned through New York from New England, I was told by the\r\ngentlemen who sent me the Check that a drunken vagabond in the club,\r\nhaving learned something about the two hundred dollars, made the\r\nexhibition out of which The Herald manufactured the article quoted by The\r\nPress of your town.\r\n\r\nMy judgment is, and therefore my request is, that you give no denial and\r\nno explanation.\r\n\r\nThanking you for your kind interest in the matter, I remain, Yours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., April 21, 1860.\r\n\r\nHAWKINS TAYLOR, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 15th is just received. It surprises me that you\r\nhave written twice, without receiving an answer. I have answered all I\r\never received from you; and certainly one since my return from the East.\r\n\r\nOpinions here, as to the prospect of Douglas being nominated, are quite\r\nconflicting--some very confident he will, and others that he will not be.\r\nI think his nomination possible, but that the chances are against him.\r\n\r\nI am glad there is a prospect of your party passing this way to Chicago.\r\nWishing to make your visit here as pleasant as we can, we wish you to\r\nnotify us as soon as possible whether you come this way, how many, and\r\nwhen you will arrive.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO A MEMBER OF THE ILLINOIS DELEGATION\r\n\r\nAT THE CHICAGO CONVENTION. SPRINGFIELD, May 17? 1860.\r\n\r\nI authorize no bargains and will be bound by none.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE COMMITTEE SENT BY THE CHICAGO CONVENTION TO INFORM\r\n\r\nLINCOLN OF HIS NOMINATION,\r\n\r\nMAY 19, 1860.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:--I tender to you, and through\r\nyou to the Republican National Convention, and all the people represented\r\nin it, my profoundest thanks for the high honor done me, which you\r\nnow formally announce. Deeply and even painfully sensible of the great\r\nresponsibility which is inseparable from this high honor--a responsibility\r\nwhich I could almost wish had fallen upon some one of the far more eminent\r\nmen and experienced statesmen whose distinguished names were before the\r\nconvention--I shall, by your leave, consider more fully the resolutions of\r\nthe convention, denominated their platform, and without any unnecessary or\r\nunreasonable delay respond to you, Mr. Chairman, in writing--not\r\ndoubting that the platform will be found satisfactory, and the nomination\r\ngratefully accepted.\r\n\r\nAnd now I will not longer defer the pleasure of taking you, and each of\r\nyou, by the hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCEPTANCE OF NOMINATION AS REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ASHMUN AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD ILLINOIS, May 23, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. GEORGE ASHMUN, President of Republican National Convention.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I accept the nomination tendered me by the convention over which you\r\npresided, and of which I am formally apprised in the letter of yourself\r\nand others, acting as a committee of the convention for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of principles and sentiments which accompanies your letter\r\nmeets my approval; and it shall be my care not to violate or disregard it\r\nin any part.\r\n\r\nImploring the assistance of Divine Providence, and with due regard to the\r\nviews and feelings of all who were represented in the convention, to the\r\nrights of all the States and Territories and people of the nation, to the\r\ninviolability of the Constitution, and the perpetual union, harmony, and\r\nprosperity of all--I am most happy to co-operate for the practical success\r\nof the principles declared by the convention.\r\n\r\nYour obliged friend and fellow-citizen,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo C. B. SMITH.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., May 26, 1860.\r\n\r\nHON. C. B. SMITH.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:-Yours of the 21st was duly received, but have found no time\r\nuntil now to say a word in the way of answer. I am indeed much indebted\r\nto Indiana; and, as my home friends tell me, much to you personally. Your\r\nsaying, you no longer consider it a doubtful State is very gratifying. The\r\nthing starts well everywhere--too well, I almost fear, to last. But we are\r\nin, and stick or go through must be the word.\r\n\r\nLet me hear from Indiana occasionally.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORM OF REPLY PREPARED BY MR. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nWITH WHICH HIS PRIVATE SECRETARY WAS INSTRUCTED TO ANSWER A NUMEROUS CLASS\r\nOF LETTERS IN THE CAMPAIGN OF 1860.\r\n\r\n(Doctrine.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, ------, 1860\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your letter to Mr. Lincoln of and by which you seek to obtain\r\nhis opinions on certain political points, has been received by him. He has\r\nreceived others of a similar character, but he also has a greater number\r\nof the exactly opposite character. The latter class beseech him to write\r\nnothing whatever upon any point of political doctrine. They say his\r\npositions were well known when he was nominated, and that he must not now\r\nembarrass the canvass by undertaking to shift or modify them. He regrets\r\nthat he cannot oblige all, but you perceive it is impossible for him to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\nJNO. J. NICOLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, MAY 26, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have several letters from you written since the\r\nnomination, but till now have found no moment to say a word by way of\r\nanswer. Of course I am glad that the nomination is well received by our\r\nfriends, and I sincerely thank you for so informing me. So far as I\r\ncan learn, the nominations start well everywhere; and, if they get no\r\nback-set, it would seem as if they are going through. I hope you will\r\nwrite often; and as you write more rapidly than I do, don't make your\r\nletters so short as mine.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO S. HAYCRAFT.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., June 4, 1860.\r\n\r\nHON. SAMUEL HAYCRAFT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Like yourself I belonged to the old Whig party from its\r\norigin to its close. I never belonged to the American party organization,\r\nnor ever to a party called a Union party; though I hope I neither am\r\nor ever have been less devoted to the Union than yourself or any other\r\npatriotic man.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM OR \"ABRAM\"\r\n\r\nTO G. ASHMUN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. June 4, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. GEORGE ASHMUN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--It seems as if the question whether my first name is\r\n\"Abraham\" or \"Abram\" will never be settled. It is \"Abraham,\" and if the\r\nletter of acceptance is not yet in print, you may, if you think fit, have\r\nmy signature thereto printed \"Abraham Lincoln.\" Exercise your judgment\r\nabout this.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nTO S. GALLOWAY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., June 19, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. SAM'L GALLOWAY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your very kind letter of the 15th is received. Messrs.\r\nFollett, Foster, & Co.'s Life of me is not by my authority; and I\r\nhave scarcely been so much astounded by anything, as by their public\r\nannouncement that it is authorized by me. They have fallen into some\r\nstrange misunderstanding. I certainly knew they contemplated publishing\r\na biography, and I certainly did not object to their doing so, upon their\r\nown responsibility. I even took pains to facilitate them. But, at the same\r\ntime, I made myself tiresome, if not hoarse, with repeating to Mr. Howard,\r\ntheir only agent seen by me, my protest that I authorized nothing--would\r\nbe responsible for nothing. How they could so misunderstand me, passes\r\ncomprehension. As a matter wholly my own, I would authorize no biography,\r\nwithout time and opportunity [sic] to carefully examine and consider every\r\nword of it and, in this case, in the nature of things, I can have no such\r\ntime and Opportunity [sic]. But, in my present position, when, by the\r\nlessons of the past, and the united voice of all discreet friends, I can\r\nneither write nor speak a word for the public, how dare I to send forth,\r\nby my authority, a volume of hundreds of pages, for adversaries to make\r\npoints upon without end? Were I to do so, the convention would have a\r\nright to re-assemble and substitute another name for mine.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I would not look at the proof sheets--I am determined\r\nto maintain the position of [sic] truly saying I never saw the proof\r\nsheets, or any part of their work, before its publication.\r\n\r\nNow, do not mistake me--I feel great kindness for Messrs. F., F., &\r\nCo.--do not think they have intentionally done wrong. There may be nothing\r\nwrong in their proposed book--I sincerely hope there will not. I barely\r\nsuggest that you, or any of the friends there, on the party account, look\r\nit over, and exclude what you may think would embarrass the party bearing\r\nin mind, at all times, that I authorize nothing--will be responsible for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The custom then, and it may have been a good one, was for the\r\nPresidential candidate to do no personal canvassing or speaking--or as we\r\nhave it now \"running for election.\" He stayed at home and kept his mouth\r\nshut. Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, July 18, 1860.\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN. MY DEAR SIR:--It appears to me that you and I ought\r\nto be acquainted, and accordingly I write this as a sort of introduction\r\nof myself to you. You first entered the Senate during the single term I\r\nwas a member of the House of Representatives, but I have no recollection\r\nthat we were introduced. I shall be pleased to receive a line from you.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of Republican success now appears very flattering, so far as\r\nI can perceive. Do you see anything to the contrary?\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. JONAS.\r\n\r\n(Confidential.) SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, JULY 21, 1860.\r\n\r\nHON. A. JONAS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 20th is received. I suppose as good or even\r\nbetter men than I may have been in American or Know-Nothing lodges; but in\r\npoint of fact, I never was in one at Quincy or elsewhere. I was never\r\nin Quincy but one day and two nights while Know-Nothing lodges were in\r\nexistence, and you were with me that day and both those nights. I had\r\nnever been there before in my life, and never afterward, till the joint\r\ndebate with Douglas in 1858. It was in 1854 when I spoke in some\r\nhall there, and after the speaking, you, with others, took me to an\r\noyster-saloon, passed an hour there, and you walked with me to, and parted\r\nwith me at, the Quincy House, quite late at night. I left by stage for\r\nNaples before daylight in the morning, having come in by the same route\r\nafter dark the evening, previous to the speaking, when I found you waiting\r\nat the Quincy House to meet me. A few days after I was there, Richardson,\r\nas I understood, started this same story about my having been in a\r\nKnow-Nothing lodge. When I heard of the charge, as I did soon after; I\r\ntaxed my recollection for some incident which could have suggested it; and\r\nI remembered that on parting with you the last night I went to the office\r\nof the hotel to take my stage-passage for the morning, was told that no\r\nstage-office for that line was kept there, and that I must see the driver\r\nbefore retiring, to insure his calling for me in the morning; and a\r\nservant was sent with me to find the driver, who, after taking me a square\r\nor two, stopped me, and stepped perhaps a dozen steps farther, and in my\r\nhearing called to some one, who answered him, apparently from the upper\r\npart of a building, and promised to call with the stage for me at the\r\nQuincy House. I returned, and went to bed, and before day the stage called\r\nand took me. This is all.\r\n\r\nThat I never was in a Know-Nothing lodge in Quincy, I should expect could\r\nbe easily proved by respectable men who were always in the lodges and\r\nnever saw me there. An affidavit of one or two such would put the matter\r\nat rest.\r\n\r\nAnd now a word of caution. Our adversaries think they can gain a point\r\nif they could force me to openly deny the charge, by which some degree\r\nof offence would be given to the Americans. For this reason it must not\r\npublicly appear that I am paying any attention to the charge.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN B. FRY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, August 15, 1860.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 9th, inclosing the letter of HON. John Minor\r\nBotts, was duly received. The latter is herewith returned according to\r\nyour request. It contains one of the many assurances I receive from the\r\nSouth, that in no probable event will there be any very formidable effort\r\nto break up the Union. The people of the South have too much of good sense\r\nand good temper to attempt the ruin of the government rather than see it\r\nadministered as it was administered by the men who made it. At least so I\r\nhope and believe. I thank you both for your own letter and a sight of that\r\nof Mr. Botts.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THURLOW WEED\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. August 17 1860.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 13th was received this morning. Douglas\r\nis managing the Bell element with great adroitness. He had his men in\r\nKentucky to vote for the Bell candidate, producing a result which has\r\nbadly alarmed and damaged Breckenridge, and at the same time has induced\r\nthe Bell men to suppose that Bell will certainly be President, if they\r\ncan keep a few of the Northern States away from us by throwing them to\r\nDouglas. But you, better than I, understand all this.\r\n\r\nI think there will be the most extraordinary effort ever made to carry New\r\nYork for Douglas. You and all others who write me from your State think\r\nthe effort cannot succeed, and I hope you are right. Still, it will\r\nrequire close watching and great efforts on the other side.\r\n\r\nHerewith I send you a copy of a letter written at New York, which\r\nsufficiently explains itself, and which may or may not give you a valuable\r\nhint. You have seen that Bell tickets have been put on the track both here\r\nand in Indiana. In both cases the object has been, I think, the same as\r\nthe Hunt movement in New York--to throw States to Douglas. In our State,\r\nwe know the thing is engineered by Douglas men, and we do not believe they\r\ncan make a great deal out of it.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLOW TO LISTEN TO CRIMINATIONS\r\n\r\nTO HON. JOHN ------------\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug. 31, 1860\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 27th is duly received. It consists almost\r\nexclusively of a historical detail of some local troubles, among some\r\nof our friends in Pennsylvania; and I suppose its object is to guard me\r\nagainst forming a prejudice against Mr. McC------____, I have not heard\r\nnear so much upon that subject as you probably suppose; and I am slow to\r\nlisten to criminations among friends, and never expose their quarrels on\r\neither side. My sincere wish is that both sides will allow bygones to be\r\nbygones, and look to the present and future only.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, September 4, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am annoyed some by a letter from a friend in Chicago, in\r\nwhich the following passage occurs: \"Hamlin has written Colfax that two\r\nmembers of Congress will, he fears, be lost in Maine, the first and sixth\r\ndistricts; and that Washburne's majority for governor will not exceed six\r\nthousand.\"\r\n\r\nI had heard something like this six weeks ago, but had been assured since\r\nthat it was not so. Your secretary of state,--Mr. Smith, I think,--whom\r\nyou introduced to me by letter, gave this assurance; more recently, Mr.\r\nFessenden, our candidate for Congress in one of those districts, wrote a\r\nrelative here that his election was sure by at least five thousand, and\r\nthat Washburne's majority would be from 14,000 to 17,000; and still\r\nlater, Mr. Fogg, of New Hampshire, now at New York serving on a national\r\ncommittee, wrote me that we were having a desperate fight in Maine, which\r\nwould end in a splendid victory for us.\r\n\r\nSuch a result as you seem to have predicted in Maine, in your letter to\r\nColfax, would, I fear, put us on the down-hill track, lose us the State\r\nelections in Pennsylvania and Indiana, and probably ruin us on the main\r\nturn in November.\r\n\r\nYou must not allow it.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, September 9, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Yours of the 5th was received last evening. I was right\r\nglad to see it. It contains the freshest \"posting\" which I now have. It\r\nrelieved me some from a little anxiety I had about Maine. Jo Medill, on\r\nAugust 30th, wrote me that Colfax had a letter from Mr. Hamlin saying we\r\nwere in great danger of losing two members of Congress in Maine, and that\r\nyour brother would not have exceeding six thousand majority for Governor.\r\nI addressed you at once, at Galena, asking for your latest information.\r\nAs you are at Washington, that letter you will receive some time after the\r\nMaine election.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., OCTOBER 10, 1860\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--I cannot give you details, but it is entirely certain that\r\nPennsylvania and Indiana have gone Republican very largely. Pennsylvania\r\n25,000, and Indiana 5000 to 10,000. Ohio of course is safe.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO L. M. BOND.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., October 15, 1860\r\n\r\nL. MONTGOMERY BOND, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: I certainly am in no temper and have no purpose to embitter\r\nthe feelings of the South, but whether I am inclined to such a course as\r\nwould in fact embitter their feelings you can better judge by my published\r\nspeeches than by anything I would say in a short letter if I were inclined\r\nnow, as I am not, to define my position anew.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER SUGGESTING A BEARD\r\n\r\nTO MISS GRACE BEDELL, RIPLEY N.Y.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., October 19, 1860\r\n\r\nMISS GRACE BEDELL.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LITTLE MISS:--Your very agreeable letter of the 15th is received.\r\nI regret the necessity of saying I have no daughter. I have three\r\nsons--one seventeen, one nine, and one seven. They with their mother\r\nconstitute my whole family. As to the whiskers, as I have never worn any,\r\ndo you not think that people would call it a piece of silly affectation\r\nwere I to begin wearing them now?\r\n\r\nI am your true friend and sincere well-wisher,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, October 26, 1860\r\n\r\nMAJOR DAVID HUNTER\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your very kind letter of the 20th was duly received, for\r\nwhich please accept my thanks. I have another letter, from a writer\r\nunknown to me, saying the officers of the army at Fort Kearny have\r\ndetermined in case of Republican success at the approaching Presidential\r\nelection, to take themselves, and the arms at that point, south, for the\r\npurpose of resistance to the government. While I think there are many\r\nchances to one that this is a humbug, it occurs to me that any real\r\nmovement of this sort in the Army would leak out and become known to you.\r\nIn such case, if it would not be unprofessional or dishonorable (of which\r\nyou are to be judge), I shall be much obliged if you will apprise me of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN\r\n\r\n(Confidential.) SPRINGFIELD. ILLINOIS, November 8, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am anxious for a personal interview with you at as early a\r\nday as possible. Can you, without much inconvenience, meet me at Chicago?\r\nIf you can, please name as early a day as you conveniently can, and\r\ntelegraph me, unless there be sufficient time before the day named to\r\ncommunicate by mail.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL HAYCRAFT.\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Nov.13, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. SAMUEL HAYCRAFT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 9th is just received. I can only answer\r\nbriefly. Rest fully assured that the good people of the South who will put\r\nthemselves in the same temper and mood towards me which you do will find\r\nno cause to complain of me.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCELEBRATION OF LINCOLN'S ELECTION,\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT THE MEETING AT SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 20, 1860\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--Please excuse me on this occasion from\r\nmaking a speech. I thank you in common with all those who have thought fit\r\nby their votes to indorse the Republican cause. I rejoice with you in the\r\nsuccess which has thus far attended that cause. Yet in all our rejoicings\r\nlet us neither express nor cherish any hard feelings toward any citizen\r\nwho by his vote has differed with us. Let us at all times remember that\r\nall American citizens are brothers of a common country, and should dwell\r\ntogether in the bonds of fraternal feeling. Let me again beg you to accept\r\nmy thanks, and to excuse me from further speaking at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. NOV. 30, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. A. H. STEPHENS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have read in the newspapers your speech recently delivered\r\n(I think) before the Georgia Legislature, or its assembled members. If you\r\nhave revised it, as is probable, I shall be much obliged if you will send\r\nme a copy.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN\r\n\r\n(Private)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 8, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 4th was duly received. The inclosed to Governor\r\nSeward covers two notes to him, copies of which you find open for your\r\ninspection. Consult with Judge Trumbull; and if you and he see no reason\r\nto the contrary, deliver the letter to Governor Seward at once. If you see\r\nreason to the contrary write me at once.\r\n\r\nI have an intimation that Governor Banks would yet accept a place in the\r\nCabinet. Please ascertain and write me how this is,\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOCKING \"COMPROMISE\" ON SLAVERY ISSUE\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., December 13, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your long letter received. Prevent, as far as possible, any\r\nof our friends from demoralizing themselves and our cause by entertaining\r\npropositions for compromise of any sort on \"slavery extension.\" There is\r\nno possible compromise upon it but which puts us under again, and leaves\r\nall our work to do over again. Whether it be a Missouri line or Eli\r\nThayer's popular sovereignty, it is all the same. Let either be done, and\r\nimmediately filibustering and extending slavery recommences. On that point\r\nhold firm, as with a chain of steel.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINION ON SECESSION\r\n\r\nTO THURLOW WEED\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, DECEMBER 17, 1860\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 11th was received two days ago. Should the\r\nconvocation of governors of which you speak seem desirous to know my views\r\non the present aspect of things, tell them you judge from my speeches that\r\nI will be inflexible on the territorial question; but I probably think\r\neither the Missouri line extended, or Douglas's and Eli Thayer's popular\r\nsovereignty would lose us everything we gain by the election; that\r\nfilibustering for all south of us and making slave States of it would\r\nfollow in spite of us, in either case; also that I probably think all\r\nopposition, real and apparent, to the fugitive slave clause of the\r\nConstitution ought to be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nI believe you can pretend to find but little, if anything, in my speeches,\r\nabout secession. But my opinion is that no State can in any way lawfully\r\nget out of the Union without the consent of the others; and that it is\r\nthe duty of the President and other government functionaries to run the\r\nmachine as it is.\r\n\r\nTruly yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME FORTS SURRENDERED TO THE SOUTH\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE\r\n\r\n(Confidential)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 21, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Last night I received your letter giving an account of your\r\ninterview with General Scott, and for which I thank you. Please present my\r\nrespects to the General, and tell him, confidentially, I shall be obliged\r\nto him to be as well prepared as he can to either hold or retake the\r\nforts, as the case may require, at and after the inauguration.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. H. STEPHENS.\r\n\r\n(For your own eye only) SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, DECEMBER 22, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. ALEXANDER STEVENS\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your obliging answer to my short note is just received, and\r\nfor which please accept my thanks. I fully appreciate the present peril\r\nthe country is in, and the weight of responsibility on me. Do the people\r\nof the South really entertain fear that a Republican administration would,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, interfere with the slaves, or with them about the\r\nslaves? If they do, I wish to assure you, as once a friend, and still, I\r\nhope, not an enemy, that there is no cause for such fears. The South\r\nwould be in no more danger in this respect than it was in the days of\r\nWashington. I suppose, however, this does not meet the case. You think\r\nslavery is right and ought to be extended, while we think it is wrong and\r\nought to be restricted. That, I suppose, is the rub. It certainly is the\r\nonly substantial difference between us.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPORT OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE CLAUSE\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nDecember [22?], 1860\r\n\r\nResolved: That the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution ought to be\r\nenforced by a law of Congress, with efficient provisions for that object,\r\nnot obliging private persons to assist in its execution, but punishing all\r\nwho resist it, and with the usual safeguards to liberty, securing free men\r\nagainst being surrendered as slaves.\r\n\r\nThat all State laws, if there be such, really or apparently in conflict\r\nwith such law of Congress, ought to be repealed; and no opposition to the\r\nexecution of such law of Congress ought to be made.\r\n\r\nThat the Federal Union must be preserved.\r\n\r\nPrepared for the consideration of the Republican members of the Senate\r\nCommittee of Thirteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO D. HUNTER.\r\n\r\n(Confidential.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS December 22, 1860\r\n\r\nMAJOR DAVID HUNTER.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am much obliged by the receipt of yours of the 18th. The\r\nmost we can do now is to watch events, and be as well prepared as possible\r\nfor any turn things may take. If the forts fall, my judgment is that they\r\nare to be retaken. When I shall determine definitely my time of starting\r\nto Washington, I will notify you.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO I. N. MORRIS\r\n\r\n(Confidential.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Dec 24, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. I. N. MORRIS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Without supposing that you and I are any nearer together,\r\npolitically, than heretofore, allow me to tender you my sincere thanks for\r\nyour Union resolution, expressive of views upon which we never were, and,\r\nI trust, never will be at variance.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATTEMPT TO FORM A COALITION CABINET\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 14, 1860.\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I need a man of Democratic antecedents from New England. I\r\ncannot get a fair share of that element in without. This stands in the way\r\nof Mr. Adams. I think of Governor Banks, Mr. Welles, and Mr. Tuck. Which\r\nof them do the New England delegation prefer? Or shall I decide for\r\nmyself?\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1861\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD. ILL., January 3, 1861.\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours without signature was received last night. I have been\r\nconsidering your suggestions as to my reaching Washington somewhat earlier\r\nthan is usual. It seems to me the inauguration is not the most dangerous\r\npoint for us. Our adversaries have us now clearly at disadvantage on the\r\nsecond Wednesday of February, when the votes should be officially counted.\r\nIf the two houses refuse to meet at all, or meet without a quorum of each,\r\nwhere shall we be? I do not think that this counting is constitutionally\r\nessential to the election, but how are we to proceed in the absence of\r\nit? In view of this, I think it is best for me not to attempt appearing in\r\nWashington till the result of that ceremony is known.\r\n\r\nIt certainly would be of some advantage if you could know who are to be\r\nat the heads of the War and Navy departments, but until I can ascertain\r\ndefinitely whether I can get any suitable men from the South, and who, and\r\nhow many, I can not well decide. As yet, I have no word from Mr. Gilmer\r\nin answer to my request for an interview with him. I look for something on\r\nthe subject, through you, before long.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., January 12, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 8th received. I still hope Mr. Gilmer will, on\r\na fair understanding with us, consent to take a place in the Cabinet. The\r\npreference for him over Mr. Hunt or Mr. Gentry is that, up to date--he\r\nhas a living position in the South, while they have not. He is only better\r\nthan Winter Davis in that he is farther south. I fear, if we could get, we\r\ncould not safely take more than one such man--that is, not more than one\r\nwho opposed us in the election--the danger being to lose the confidence\r\nof our own friends. Your selection for the State Department having become\r\npublic, I am happy to find scarcely any objection to it. I shall have\r\ntrouble with every other Northern Cabinet appointment--so much so that I\r\nshall have to defer them as long as possible to avoid being teased into\r\ninsanity, to make changes.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. D. MORGAN\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. FEB. 4, 1861\r\n\r\nSIR:--Your letter of the 30th ult. inviting me, on behalf of the\r\nLegislature of New York, to pass through that State on my way to\r\nWashington, and tendering me the hospitalities of her authorities and\r\npeople, has been duly received. With the feelings of deep gratitude to\r\nyou and them for this testimonial of regard and esteem I beg you to notify\r\nthem that I accept the invitation so kindly tendered.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nP.S.--Please let the ceremonies be only such as to take the least time\r\npossible. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRONAGE CLAIMS\r\n\r\nTO THURLOW WEED\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., February 4, 1861\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I have both your letter to myself and that to Judge Davis,\r\nin relation to a certain gentleman in your State claiming to dispense\r\npatronage in my name, and also to be authorized to use my name to advance\r\nthe chances of Mr. Greeley for an election to the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nIt is very strange that such things should be said by any one. The\r\ngentleman you mention did speak to me of Mr. Greeley in connection with\r\nthe senatorial election, and I replied in terms of kindness toward Mr.\r\nGreeley, which I really feel, but always with an expressed protest that\r\nmy name must not be used in the senatorial election in favor of or against\r\nany one. Any other representation of me is a misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nAs to the matter of dispensing patronage, it perhaps will surprise you\r\nto learn that I have information that you claim to have my authority to\r\narrange that matter in New York. I do not believe you have so claimed; but\r\nstill so some men say. On that subject you know all I have said to you is\r\n\"justice to all,\" and I have said nothing more particular to any one. I\r\nsay this to reassure you that I have not changed my position.\r\n\r\nIn the hope, however, that you will not use my name in the matter, I am,\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAREWELL ADDRESS AT SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 11, 1861\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS:--One who has never been placed in a like position cannot\r\nunderstand my feelings at this hour, nor the oppressive sadness I feel at\r\nthis parting. For more than twenty-five years I have lived among you, and\r\nduring all that time I have received nothing but kindness at your hands.\r\nHere the most cherished ties of earth were assumed. Here my children were\r\nborn, and here one of them lies buried. To you, my friends, I owe all that\r\nI have, all that I am. All the strange checkered past seems to crowd upon\r\nmy mind. To-day I leave you. I go to assume a task more difficult than\r\nthat which devolved upon General Washington. Unless the great God who\r\nassisted him shall be with and aid me I cannot prevail; but if the same\r\nalmighty arm that directed and protected him shall guide and support me I\r\nshall not fail; I shall succeed. Let us pray that the God of our fathers\r\nmay not forsake us now. To Him I commend you all. Permit me to ask that\r\nwith equal sincerity and faith you will all invoke His wisdom and goodness\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nWith these words I must leave you; for how long I know not. Friends, one\r\nand all, I must now wish you an affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT TOLONO, ILLINOIS, FEBRUARY 11, 1861\r\n\r\nI am leaving you on an errand of national importance, attended, as you are\r\naware, with considerable difficulties. Let us believe, as some poet has\r\nexpressed it, \"Behind the cloud the sun is still shining.\" I bid you an\r\naffectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO ADDRESS OF WELCOME, INDIANAPOLIS,\r\n\r\nINDIANA, FEBRUARY 11, 1861\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR MORTON AND FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF INDIANA:\r\n\r\nMost heartily do I thank you for this magnificent reception, and while\r\nI cannot take to myself any share of the compliment thus paid, more\r\nthan that which pertains to a mere instrument, an accidental instrument,\r\nperhaps I should say, of a great cause, I yet must look upon it as a most\r\nmagnificent reception, and as such most heartily do thank you for it.\r\nYou have been pleased to address yourself to me chiefly in behalf of\r\nthis glorious Union in which we live, in all of which you have my hearty\r\nsympathy, and, as far as may be within my power, will have, one and\r\ninseparable, my hearty consideration. While I do not expect, upon this\r\noccasion, or until I get to Washington, to attempt any lengthy speech,\r\nI will only say to the salvation of the Union there needs but one single\r\nthing--the hearts of a people like yours.\r\n\r\nThe people--when they rise in mass in behalf of the Union and the\r\nliberties of their country, truly may it be said, \"The gates of hell\r\ncannot prevail against them.\" In all trying positions in which I shall be\r\nplaced--and, doubtless, I shall be placed in many such--my reliance will\r\nbe placed upon you and the people of the United States; and I wish you to\r\nremember, now and forever, that it is your business, and not mine; that if\r\nthe union of these States and the liberties of this people shall be lost,\r\nit is but little to any one man of fifty-two years of age, but a great\r\ndeal to the thirty millions of people who inhabit these United States, and\r\nto their posterity in all coming time. It is your business to rise up and\r\npreserve the Union and liberty for yourselves, and not for me.\r\n\r\nI desire they should be constitutionally performed. I, as already\r\nintimated, am but an accidental instrument, temporary, and to serve but\r\nfor a limited time; and I appeal to you again to constantly bear in mind\r\nthat with you, and not with politicians, not with Presidents, not with\r\noffice-seekers, but with you is the question, Shall the Union and shall\r\nthe liberties of this country be preserved to the latest generations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE LEGISLATURE OF INDIANA, AT INDIANAPOLIS,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 12, 1861\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF INDIANA:--I am here to thank you much for\r\nthis magnificent welcome, and still more for the generous support given\r\nby your State to that political cause which I think is the true and just\r\ncause of the whole country and the whole world.\r\n\r\nSolomon says there is \"a time to keep silence,\" and when men wrangle by\r\nthe mouth with no certainty that they mean the same thing while using the\r\nsame word, it perhaps were as well if they would keep silence.\r\n\r\nThe words \"coercion\" and \"invasion\" are much used in these days, and often\r\nwith some temper and hot blood. Let us make sure, if we can, the meaning\r\nof those who use them. Let us get the exact definitions of these words,\r\nnot from dictionaries, but from the men themselves, who certainly\r\ndeprecate the things they would represent by the use of the words.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is coercion? What is invasion? Would the marching of an army\r\ninto South Carolina, without the consent of her people, and with hostile\r\nintent toward them, be invasion? I certainly think it would, and it would\r\nbe coercion also, if the South Carolinians were forced to submit. But if\r\nthe United States should merely hold and retake its own forts and other\r\nproperty, and collect the duties on foreign importations, or even withhold\r\nthe mails from places where they were habitually violated, would any or\r\nall of these things be invasion or coercion? Do our professed lovers\r\nof the Union, who spitefully resolve that they will resist coercion and\r\ninvasion, understand that such things as these, on the part of the United\r\nStates, would be coercion or invasion of a State? If so, their idea of\r\nmeans to preserve the object of their great affection would seem to be\r\nexceedingly thin and airy. If sick, the little pills of the homoeopathist\r\nwould be much too large for it to swallow. In their view, the Union, as a\r\nfamily relation, would seem to be no regular marriage, but rather a sort\r\nof \"free-love\" arrangement, to be maintained on passional attraction.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in what consists the special sacredness of a State? I speak\r\nnot of the position assigned to a State in the Union by the Constitution,\r\nfor that is a bond we all recognize. That position, however, a State\r\ncannot carry out of the Union with it. I speak of that assumed primary\r\nright of a State to rule all which is less than itself, and to ruin all\r\nwhich is larger than itself. If a State and a county, in a given case,\r\nshould be equal in number of inhabitants, in what, as a matter of\r\nprinciple, is the State better than the county? Would an exchange of\r\nname be an exchange of rights? Upon what principle, upon what rightful\r\nprinciple, may a State, being no more than one fiftieth part of the\r\nnation in soil and population, break up the nation, and then coerce a\r\nproportionably large subdivision of itself in the most arbitrary way? What\r\nmysterious right to play tyrant is conferred on a district of country,\r\nwith its people, by merely calling it a State? Fellow-citizens, I am not\r\nasserting anything. I am merely asking questions for you to consider. And\r\nnow allow me to bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTENTIONS TOWARD THE SOUTH\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE MAYOR AND CITIZENS OF\r\n\r\nCINCINNATI, OHIO, FEBRUARY 12, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. MAYOR, AND GENTLEMEN:--Twenty-four hours ago, at the capital of\r\nIndiana, I said to myself, \"I have never seen so many people assembled\r\ntogether in winter weather.\" I am no longer able to say that. But it\r\nis what might reasonably have been expected--that this great city of\r\nCincinnati would thus acquit herself on such an occasion. My friends, I am\r\nentirely overwhelmed by the magnificence of the reception which has been\r\ngiven, I will not say to me, but to the President-elect of the United\r\nStates of America. Most heartily do I thank you, one and all, for it.\r\n\r\nI have spoken but once before this in Cincinnati. That was a year previous\r\nto the late Presidential election. On that occasion, in a playful\r\nmanner, but with sincere words, I addressed much of what I said to the\r\nKentuckians. I gave my opinion that we, as Republicans, would ultimately\r\nbeat them as Democrats, but that they could postpone that result longer by\r\nnominating Senator Douglas for the Presidency than they could by any other\r\nway. They did not, in any true sense of the word, nominate Mr. Douglas,\r\nand the result has come certainly as soon as ever I expected. I also told\r\nthem how I expected they would be treated after they should have been\r\nbeaten, and I now wish to call their attention to what I then said upon\r\nthat subject. I then said:\r\n\r\n\"When we do as we say, beat you, you perhaps want to know what we will\r\ndo with you. I will tell you, as far as I am authorized to speak for the\r\nOpposition, what we mean to do with you. We mean to treat you, as near\r\nas we possibly can, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison treated you.\r\nWe mean to leave you alone, and in no way to interfere with your\r\ninstitutions; to abide by all and every compromise of the Constitution,\r\nand, in a word, coming back to the original proposition, to treat you\r\nso far as degenerate men, if we have degenerated, may, according to the\r\nexample of those noble fathers, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison.\r\n\r\n\"We mean to remember that you are as good as we; that there is no\r\ndifference between us other than the difference of circumstances. We mean\r\nto recognize and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in\r\nyour bosoms as other people, or as we claim to have, and treat you\r\naccordingly.\"\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens of Kentucky--friends and brethren, may I call you in my\r\nnew position?--I see no occasion and feel no inclination to retract a word\r\nof this. If it shall not be made good, be assured the fault shall not be\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE GERMAN CLUB OF CINCINNATI, OHIO,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 12, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN:--I thank you and those whom you represent for the compliment\r\nyou have paid me by tendering me this address. In so far as there is an\r\nallusion to our present national difficulties, which expresses, as you\r\nhave said, the views of the gentlemen present, I shall have to beg pardon\r\nfor not entering fully upon the questions which the address you have now\r\nread suggests.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty--a duty which I owe to my constituents--to you,\r\ngentlemen, that I should wait until the last moment for a development of\r\nthe present national difficulties before I express myself decidedly as to\r\nwhat course I shall pursue. I hope, then, not to be false to anything that\r\nyou have expected of me.\r\n\r\nI agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that the working men are the basis of all\r\ngovernments, for the plain reason that they are all the more numerous,\r\nand as you added that those were the sentiments of the gentlemen present,\r\nrepresenting not only the working class, but citizens of other callings\r\nthan those of the mechanic, I am happy to concur with you in these\r\nsentiments, not only of the native-born citizens, but also of the Germans\r\nand foreigners from other countries.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, I hold that while man exists it is his duty to improve not\r\nonly his own condition, but to assist in ameliorating the condition of\r\nmankind; and therefore, without entering upon the details of the question,\r\nI will simply say that I am for those means which will give the greatest\r\ngood to the greatest number.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Homestead law, I have to say that, in so far as the\r\ngovernment lands can be disposed of, I am in favor of cutting up the wild\r\nlands into parcels, so that every poor man may have a home.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Germans and foreigners, I esteem them no better than\r\nother people, nor any worse. It is not my nature, when I see a people\r\nborne down by the weight of their shackles--the oppression of tyranny--to\r\nmake their life more bitter by heaping upon them greater burdens; but\r\nrather would I do all in my power to raise the yoke than to add anything\r\nthat would tend to crush them.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as our own country is extensive and new, and the countries of\r\nEurope are densely populated, if there are any abroad who desire to make\r\nthis the land of their adoption, it is not in my heart to throw aught in\r\ntheir way to prevent them from coming to the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and gentlemen, I will bid you an affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE LEGISLATURE OF OHIO AT COLUMBUS\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 13, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT AND Mr. SPEAKER, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF\r\nOHIO:--It is true, as has been said by the president of the Senate, that\r\nvery great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the\r\nvotes of the American people have called me. I am deeply sensible of that\r\nweighty responsibility. I cannot but know what you all know, that without\r\na name, perhaps without a reason why I should have a name, there has\r\nfallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the Father of his\r\nCountry; and so feeling, I can turn and look for that support without\r\nwhich it will be impossible for me to perform that great task. I turn,\r\nthen, and look to the American people and to that God who has never\r\nforsaken them. Allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to\r\nthe policy of the new administration. In this I have received from some\r\na degree of credit for having kept silence, and from others some\r\ndeprecation. I still think that I was right.\r\n\r\nIn the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present, and without\r\na precedent which could enable me to judge by the past, it has seemed\r\nfitting that before speaking upon the difficulties of the country I should\r\nhave gained a view of the whole field, being at liberty to modify and\r\nchange the course of policy as future events may make a change necessary.\r\n\r\nI have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety. It is a\r\ngood thing that there is no more than anxiety, for there is nothing going\r\nwrong. It is a consoling circumstance that when we look out there is\r\nnothing that really hurts anybody. We entertain different views upon\r\npolitical questions, but nobody is suffering anything. This is a most\r\nconsoling circumstance, and from it we may conclude that all we want is\r\ntime, patience, and a reliance on that God who has never forsaken this\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, what I have said I have said altogether extemporaneously,\r\nand I will now come to a close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT STEUBENVILLE, OHIO,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 14, 1861\r\n\r\nI fear that the great confidence placed in my ability is unfounded.\r\nIndeed, I am sure it is. Encompassed by vast difficulties as I am, nothing\r\nshall be wanting on my part, if sustained by God and the American people.\r\nI believe the devotion to the Constitution is equally great on both sides\r\nof the river. It is only the different understanding of that instrument\r\nthat causes difficulty. The only dispute on both sides is, \"What are their\r\nrights?\" If the majority should not rule, who would be the judge? Where\r\nis such a judge to be found? We should all be bound by the majority of\r\nthe American people; if not, then the minority must control. Would that be\r\nright? Would it be just or generous? Assuredly not. I reiterate that\r\nthe majority should rule. If I adopt a wrong policy, the opportunity for\r\ncondemnation will occur in four years' time. Then I can be turned out, and\r\na better man with better views put in my place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 15, 1861\r\n\r\nI most cordially thank his Honor Mayor Wilson, and the citizens of\r\nPittsburg generally, for their flattering reception. I am the more\r\ngrateful because I know that it is not given to me alone, but to the cause\r\nI represent, which clearly proves to me their good-will, and that sincere\r\nfeeling is at the bottom of it. And here I may remark that in every short\r\naddress I have made to the people, in every crowd through which I have\r\npassed of late, some allusion has been made to the present distracted\r\ncondition of the country. It is natural to expect that I should say\r\nsomething on this subject; but to touch upon it at all would involve\r\nan elaborate discussion of a great many questions and circumstances,\r\nrequiring more time than I can at present command, and would, perhaps,\r\nunnecessarily commit me upon matters which have not yet fully developed\r\nthemselves. The condition of the country is an extraordinary one, and\r\nfills the mind of every patriot with anxiety. It is my intention to\r\ngive this subject all the consideration I possibly can before specially\r\ndeciding in regard to it, so that when I do speak it may be as nearly\r\nright as possible. When I do speak I hope I may say nothing in opposition\r\nto the spirit of the Constitution, contrary to the integrity of the Union,\r\nor which will prove inimical to the liberties of the people, or to the\r\npeace of the whole country. And furthermore, when the time arrives for me\r\nto speak on this great subject, I hope I may say nothing to disappoint the\r\npeople generally throughout the country, especially if the expectation has\r\nbeen based upon anything which I may have heretofore said. Notwithstanding\r\nthe troubles across the river [the speaker pointing southwardly across the\r\nMonongahela, and smiling], there is no crisis but an artificial one. What\r\nis there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends\r\nover the river? Take even their own view of the questions involved, and\r\nthere is nothing to justify the course they are pursuing. I repeat, then,\r\nthere is no crisis, excepting such a one as may be gotten up at any time\r\nby turbulent men aided by designing politicians, My advice to them, under\r\nsuch circumstances, is to keep cool. If the great American people only\r\nkeep their temper on both sides of the line, the troubles will come to\r\nan end, and the question which now distracts the country will be settled,\r\njust as surely as all other difficulties of a like character which have\r\noriginated in this government have been adjusted. Let the people on both\r\nsides keep their self-possession, and just as other clouds have cleared\r\naway in due time, so will this great nation continue to prosper as\r\nheretofore. But, fellow-citizens, I have spoken longer on this subject\r\nthan I intended at the outset.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that the tariff is the specialty of Pennsylvania.\r\nAssuming that direct taxation is not to be adopted, the tariff question\r\nmust be as durable as the government itself. It is a question of national\r\nhousekeeping. It is to the government what replenishing the meal-tub is\r\nto the family. Every varying circumstances will require frequent\r\nmodifications as to the amount needed and the sources of supply. So\r\nfar there is little difference of opinion among the people. It is as to\r\nwhether, and how far, duties on imports shall be adjusted to favor home\r\nproduction in the home market, that controversy begins. One party insists\r\nthat such adjustment oppresses one class for the advantage of another;\r\nwhile the other party argues that, with all its incidents, in the long run\r\nall classes are benefited. In the Chicago platform there is a plank upon\r\nthis subject which should be a general law to the incoming administration.\r\nWe should do neither more nor less than we gave the people reason\r\nto believe we would when they gave us their votes. Permit me,\r\nfellow-citizens, to read the tariff plank of the Chicago platform, or\r\nrather have it read in your hearing by one who has younger eyes.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Lincoln's private secretary then read Section 12 of the Chicago\r\nplatform, as follows:]\r\n\r\n\"That, while providing revenue for the support of the General Government\r\nby duties upon imports, sound policy requires such an adjustment of these\r\nimposts as will encourage the development of the industrial interest of\r\nthe whole country; and we commend that policy of national exchanges which\r\nsecures to working-men liberal wages, to agriculture remunerating prices,\r\nto mechanics and manufacturers adequate return for their skill, labor, and\r\nenterprise, and to the nation commercial prosperity and independence.\"\r\n\r\nAs with all general propositions, doubtless, there will be shades of\r\ndifference in construing this. I have by no means a thoroughly matured\r\njudgment upon this subject, especially as to details; some general ideas\r\nare about all. I have long thought it would be to our advantage to produce\r\nany necessary article at home which can be made of as good quality and\r\nwith as little labor at home as abroad, at least by the difference of the\r\ncarrying from abroad. In such case the carrying is demonstrably a dead\r\nloss of labor. For instance, labor being the true standard of value, is it\r\nnot plain that if equal labor get a bar of railroad iron out of a mine in\r\nEngland and another out of a mine in Pennsylvania, each can be laid down\r\nin a track at home cheaper than they could exchange countries, at least\r\nby the carriage? If there be a present cause why one can be both made\r\nand carried cheaper in money price than the other can be made without\r\ncarrying, that cause is an unnatural and injurious one, and ought\r\ngradually, if not rapidly, to be removed. The condition of the treasury\r\nat this time would seem to render an early revision of the tariff\r\nindispensable. The Morrill [tariff] bill, now pending before Congress, may\r\nor may not become a law. I am not posted as to its particular provisions,\r\nbut if they are generally satisfactory, and the bill shall now pass, there\r\nwill be an end for the present. If, however, it shall not pass, I suppose\r\nthe whole subject will be one of the most pressing and important for the\r\nnext Congress. By the Constitution, the executive may recommend measures\r\nwhich he may think proper, and he may veto those he thinks improper, and\r\nit is supposed that he may add to these certain indirect influences to\r\naffect the action of Congress. My political education strongly inclines me\r\nagainst a very free use of any of these means by the executive to control\r\nthe legislation of the country. As a rule, I think it better that Congress\r\nshould originate as well as perfect its measures without external bias. I\r\ntherefore would rather recommend to every gentleman who knows he is to be\r\na member of the next Congress to take an enlarged view, and post himself\r\nthoroughly, so as to contribute his part to such an adjustment of the\r\ntariff as shall produce a sufficient revenue, and in its other bearings,\r\nso far as possible, be just and equal to all sections of the country and\r\nclasses of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT CLEVELAND, OHIO,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 15, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF CLEVELAND:--We have been marching\r\nabout two miles through snow, rain, and deep mud. The large numbers that\r\nhave turned out under these circumstances testify that you are in earnest\r\nabout something or other. But do I think so meanly of you as to suppose\r\nthat that earnestness is about me personally? I would be doing you an\r\ninjustice to suppose you did. You have assembled to testify your respect\r\nfor the Union, the Constitution, and the laws; and here let me say that it\r\nis with you, the people, to advance the great cause of the Union and the\r\nConstitution, and not with any one man. It rests with you alone. This fact\r\nis strongly impressed upon my mind at present. In a community like this,\r\nwhose appearance testifies to their intelligence, I am convinced that the\r\ncause of liberty and the Union can never be in danger. Frequent allusion\r\nis made to the excitement at present existing in our national politics,\r\nand it is as well that I should also allude to it here. I think that\r\nthere is no occasion for any excitement. 'The crisis, as it is called,\r\nis altogether an artificial crisis. In all parts of the nation there are\r\ndifferences of opinion on politics. There are differences of opinion even\r\nhere. You did not all vote for the person who now addresses you. What is\r\nhappening now will not hurt those who are farther away from here. Have\r\nthey not all their rights now as they ever have had? Do they not have\r\ntheir fugitive slaves returned now as ever? Have they not the same\r\nConstitution that they have lived under for seventy-odd years? Have they\r\nnot a position as citizens of this common country, and have we any power\r\nto change that position? What, then, is the matter with them? Why all this\r\nexcitement? Why all these complaints?\r\n\r\nAs I said before, this crisis is all artificial! It has no foundation in\r\nfacts. It is not argued up, as the saying is, and cannot, therefore, be\r\nargued down. Let it alone and it will go down of itself.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Lincoln then said that they must be content with a few words from\r\nhim, as he was tired, etc. Having been given to understand that the\r\ncrowd was not all Republican, but consisted of men of all parties, he\r\ncontinued:]\r\n\r\nThis is as it should be. If Judge Douglas had been elected and had been\r\nhere on his way to Washington, as I am to-night, the Republicans should\r\nhave joined his supporters in welcoming him, just as his friends have\r\njoined with mine tonight. If all do not join now to save the good old\r\nship of the Union this voyage, nobody will have a chance to pilot her on\r\nanother voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT BUFFALO, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 16, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. MAYOR AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF BUFFALO AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK:--I\r\nam here to thank you briefly for this grand reception given to me, not\r\npersonally, but as the representative of our great and beloved country.\r\nYour worthy mayor has been pleased to mention, in his address to me, the\r\nfortunate and agreeable journey which I have had from home, on my rather\r\ncircuitous route to the Federal capital. I am very happy that he was\r\nenabled in truth to congratulate myself and company on that fact. It is\r\ntrue we have had nothing thus far to mar the pleasure of the trip. We have\r\nnot been met alone by those who assisted in giving the election to me--I\r\nsay not alone by them, but by the whole population of the country through\r\nwhich we have passed. This is as it should be. Had the election fallen\r\nto any other of the distinguished candidates instead of myself, under the\r\npeculiar circumstances, to say the least, it would have been proper for\r\nall citizens to have greeted him as you now greet me. It is an evidence of\r\nthe devotion of the whole people to the Constitution, the Union, and\r\nthe perpetuity of the liberties of this country. I am unwilling on any\r\noccasion that I should be so meanly thought of as to have it supposed for\r\na moment that these demonstrations are tendered to me personally. They are\r\ntendered to the country, to the institutions of the country, and to the\r\nperpetuity of the liberties of the country, for which these institutions\r\nwere made and created.\r\n\r\nYour worthy mayor has thought fit to express the hope that I may be able\r\nto relieve the country from the present, or, I should say, the threatened\r\ndifficulties. I am sure I bring a heart true to the work. For the ability\r\nto perform it, I must trust in that Supreme Being who has never forsaken\r\nthis favored land, through the instrumentality of this great and\r\nintelligent people. Without that assistance I shall surely fail; with it,\r\nI cannot fail. When we speak of threatened difficulties to the Country,\r\nit is natural that it should be expected that something should be said by\r\nmyself with regard to particular measures. Upon more mature reflection,\r\nhowever, others will agree with me that, when it is considered that these\r\ndifficulties are without precedent, and have never been acted upon by any\r\nindividual situated as I am, it is most proper I should wait and see the\r\ndevelopments, and get all the light possible, so that when I do speak\r\nauthoritatively, I may be as near right as possible. When I shall speak\r\nauthoritatively, I hope to say nothing inconsistent with the Constitution,\r\nthe Union, the rights of all the States, of each State, and of each\r\nsection of the country, and not to disappoint the reasonable expectations\r\nof those who have confided to me their votes. In this connection allow me\r\nto say that you, as a portion of the great American people, need only to\r\nmaintain your composure, stand up to your sober convictions of right, to\r\nyour obligations to the Constitution, and act in accordance with those\r\nsober convictions, and the clouds now on the horizon will be dispelled,\r\nand we shall have a bright and glorious future; and when this generation\r\nhas passed away, tens of thousands will inhabit this country where only\r\nthousands inhabit it now. I do not propose to address you at length; I\r\nhave no voice for it. Allow me again to thank you for this magnificent\r\nreception, and bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT ROCHESTER, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1861\r\n\r\nI confess myself, after having seen many large audiences since leaving\r\nhome, overwhelmed with this vast number of faces at this hour of the\r\nmorning. I am not vain enough to believe that you are here from any\r\nwish to see me as an individual, but because I am for the time being the\r\nrepresentative of the American people. I could not, if I would, address\r\nyou at any length. I have not the strength, even if I had the time, for a\r\nspeech at each of these many interviews that are afforded me on my way to\r\nWashington. I appear merely to see you, and to let you see me, and to\r\nbid you farewell. I hope it will be understood that it is from no\r\ndisinclination to oblige anybody that I do not address you at greater\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT SYRACUSE, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I See you have erected a very fine and handsome\r\nplatform here for me, and I presume you expected me to speak from it. If\r\nI should go upon it, you would imagine that I was about to deliver you\r\na much longer speech than I am. I wish you to understand that I mean no\r\ndiscourtesy to you by thus declining. I intend discourtesy to no one.\r\nBut I wish you to understand that, though I am unwilling to go upon this\r\nplatform, you are not at liberty to draw inferences concerning any other\r\nplatform with which my name has been or is connected. I wish you long life\r\nand prosperity individually, and pray that with the perpetuity of those\r\ninstitutions under which we have all so long lived and prospered, our\r\nhappiness may be secured, our future made brilliant, and the glorious\r\ndestiny of our country established forever. I bid you a kind farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT UTICA, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1860\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I have no speech to make to you; and no time to\r\nspeak in. I appear before you that I may see you, and that you may see me;\r\nand I am willing to admit that so far as the ladies are concerned I have\r\nthe best of the bargain, though I wish it to be understood that I do not\r\nmake the same acknowledgment concerning the men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MAYOR OF ALBANY, NEW YORK\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR:--I can hardly appropriate to myself the flattering terms in\r\nwhich you communicate the tender of this reception, as personal to myself.\r\nI most gratefully accept the hospitalities tendered to me, and will not\r\ndetain you or the audience with any extended remarks at this time. I\r\npresume that in the two or three courses through which I shall have to go,\r\nI shall have to repeat somewhat, and I will therefore only express to you\r\nmy thanks for this kind reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO GOVERNOR MORGAN OF NEW YORK, AT ALBANY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR MORGAN:--I was pleased to receive an invitation to visit the\r\ncapital of the great Empire State of this nation while on my way to the\r\nFederal capital. I now thank you, Mr. Governor, and you, the people of\r\nthe capital of the State of New York, for this most hearty and magnificent\r\nwelcome. If I am not at fault, the great Empire State at this time\r\ncontains a larger population than did the whole of the United States of\r\nAmerica at the time they achieved their national independence, and I was\r\nproud--to be invited to visit its capital, to meet its citizens, as I now\r\nhave the honor to do. I am notified by your governor that this reception\r\nis tendered by citizens without distinction of party. Because of this\r\nI accept it the more gladly. In this country, and in any country where\r\nfreedom of thought is tolerated, citizens attach themselves to political\r\nparties. It is but an ordinary degree of charity to attribute this act to\r\nthe supposition that, in thus attaching themselves to the various parties,\r\neach man in his own judgment supposes he thereby best advances the\r\ninterests of the whole country. And when an election is past it is\r\naltogether befitting a free people, as I suppose, that, until the next\r\nelection, they should be one people. The reception you have extended me\r\nto-day is not given to me personally,--it should not be so,--but as the\r\nrepresentative, for the time being, of the majority of the nation. If the\r\nelection had fallen to any of the more distinguished citizens who received\r\nthe support of the people, this same honor should have greeted him that\r\ngreets me this day, in testimony of the universal, unanimous devotion\r\nof the whole people to the Constitution, the Union, and to the perpetual\r\nliberties of succeeding generations in this country.\r\n\r\nI have neither the voice nor the strength to address you at any greater\r\nlength. I beg you will therefore accept my most grateful thanks for this\r\nmanifest devotion--not to me, but the institutions of this great and\r\nglorious country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE LEGISLATURE OF NEW YORK, AT ALBANY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF NEW\r\nYORK:--It is with feelings of great diffidence, and, I may say, with\r\nfeelings of awe, perhaps greater than I have recently experienced, that I\r\nmeet you here in this place. The history of this great State, the renown\r\nof those great men who have stood here, and have spoken here, and have\r\nbeen heard here, all crowd around my fancy, and incline me to shrink from\r\nany attempt to address you. Yet I have some confidence given me by the\r\ngenerous manner in which you have invited me, and by the still more\r\ngenerous manner in which you have received me, to speak further. You\r\nhave invited and received me without distinction of party. I cannot for\r\na moment suppose that this has been done in any considerable degree with\r\nreference to my personal services, but that it is done in so far as I am\r\nregarded, at this time, as the representative of the majesty of this great\r\nnation. I doubt not this is the truth, and the whole truth of the case,\r\nand this is as it should be. It is much more gratifying to me that this\r\nreception has been given to me as the elected representative of a free\r\npeople, than it could possibly be if tendered merely as an evidence of\r\ndevotion to me, or to any one man personally.\r\n\r\nAnd now I think it were more fitting that I should close these hasty\r\nremarks. It is true that, while I hold myself, without mock modesty,\r\nthe humblest of all individuals that have ever been elevated to the\r\nPresidency, I have a more difficult task to perform than any one of them.\r\n\r\nYou have generously tendered me the support--the united support--of the\r\ngreat Empire State. For this, in behalf of the nation--in behalf of the\r\npresent and future of the nation--in behalf of civil and religious liberty\r\nfor all time to come, most gratefully do I thank you. I do not propose\r\nto enter into an explanation of any particular line of policy, as to our\r\npresent difficulties, to be adopted by the incoming administration. I deem\r\nit just to you, to myself, to all, that I should see everything, that I\r\nshould hear everything, that I should have every light that can be brought\r\nwithin my reach, in order that, when I do so speak, I shall have enjoyed\r\nevery opportunity to take correct and true ground; and for this reason I\r\ndo not propose to speak at this time of the policy of the Government. But\r\nwhen the time comes, I shall speak, as well as I am able, for the good of\r\nthe present and future of this country for the good both of the North and\r\nof the South--for the good of the one and the other, and of all sections\r\nof the country. In the meantime, if we have patience, if we restrain\r\nourselves, if we allow ourselves not to run off in a passion, I still have\r\nconfidence that the Almighty, the Maker of the universe, will, through\r\nthe instrumentality of this great and intelligent people, bring us through\r\nthis as He has through all the other difficulties of our country. Relying\r\non this, I again thank you for this generous reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT TROY, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR AND CITIZENS OF TROY:--I thank you very kindly for this great\r\nreception. Since I left my home it has not been my fortune to meet\r\nan assemblage more numerous and more orderly than this. I am the more\r\ngratified at this mark of your regard since you assure me it is tendered,\r\nnot to the individual but to the high office you have called me to fill.\r\nI have neither strength nor time to make any extended remarks on this\r\noccasion, and I can only repeat to you my sincere thanks for the kind\r\nreception you have thought proper to extend to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT POUGHKEEPSIE, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--It is altogether impossible I should make myself heard\r\nby any considerable portion of this vast assemblage; but, although I\r\nappear before you mainly for the purpose of seeing you, and to let you\r\nsee rather than hear me, I cannot refrain from saying that I am highly\r\ngratified--as much here, indeed, under the circumstances, as I have been\r\nanywhere on my route--to witness this noble demonstration--made, not\r\nin honor of an individual, but of the man who at this time humbly, but\r\nearnestly, represents the majesty of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis reception, like all the others that have been tendered to me,\r\ndoubtless emanates from all the political parties, and not from one alone.\r\nAs such I accept it the more gratefully, since it indicates an earnest\r\ndesire on the part of the whole people, with out regard to political\r\ndifferences, to save--not the country, because the country will save\r\nitself but to save the institutions of the country, those institutions\r\nunder which, in the last three quarters of a century, we have grown to\r\na great, and intelligent, and a happy people--the greatest, the\r\nmost intelligent, and the happiest people in the world. These noble\r\nmanifestations indicate, with unerring certainty, that the whole people\r\nare willing to make common cause for this object; that if, as it ever must\r\nbe, some have been successful in the recent election and some have been\r\nbeaten, if some are satisfied and some are dissatisfied, the defeated\r\nparty are not in favor of sinking the ship, but are desirous of running it\r\nthrough the tempest in safety, and willing, if they think the people have\r\ncommitted an error in their verdict now, to wait in the hope of reversing\r\nit and setting it right next time. I do not say that in the recent\r\nelection the people did the wisest thing, that could have been\r\ndone--indeed, I do not think they did; but I do say that in accepting the\r\ngreat trust committed to me, which I do with a determination to endeavor\r\nto prove worthy of it, I must rely upon you, upon the people of the whole\r\ncountry, for support; and with their sustaining aid, even I, humble as I\r\nam, cannot fail to carry the ship of state safely through the storm.\r\n\r\nI have now only to thank you warmly for your kind attendance, and bid you\r\nall an affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT HUDSON, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1860\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I see that you are providing a platform for me. I shall\r\nhave to decline standing upon it, because the president of the company\r\ntells me that I shall not have time to wait until it is brought to me. As\r\nI said yesterday, under similar circumstances at another gathering, you\r\nmust not draw the inference that I have any intention of deserting any\r\nplatform with which I have a legitimate connection because I do not stand\r\non yours. Allow me to thank you for this splendid reception, and I now bid\r\nyou farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT PEEKSKILL, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I have but a moment to stand before you to listen\r\nto and return your kind greeting. I thank you for this reception, and for\r\nthe pleasant manner in which it is tendered to me by our mutual friends.\r\nI will say in a single sentence, in regard to the difficulties that lie\r\nbefore me and our beloved country, that if I can only be as generously and\r\nunanimously sustained as the demonstrations I have witnessed indicate I\r\nshall be, I shall not fail; but without your sustaining hands I am sure\r\nthat neither I nor any other man can hope to surmount these difficulties.\r\nI trust that in the course I shall pursue I shall be sustained not only\r\nby the party that elected me, but by the patriotic people of the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT FISHKILL LANDING\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I appear before you not to make a speech. I have\r\nnot sufficient time, if I had the strength, to repeat speeches at every\r\nstation where the people kindly gather to welcome me as we go along. If I\r\nhad the strength, and should take the time, I should not get to Washington\r\nuntil after the inauguration, which you must be aware would not fit\r\nexactly. That such an untoward event might not transpire, I know you will\r\nreadily forego any further remarks; and I close by bidding you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT THE ASTOR HOUSE, NEW YORK CITY, FEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I have stepped before you merely in compliance with what\r\nappears to be your wish, and not with the purpose of making a speech. I\r\ndo not propose making a speech this afternoon. I could not be heard by any\r\nbut a small fraction of you, at best; but, what is still worse than that,\r\nI have nothing just now to say that is worthy of your hearing. I beg you\r\nto believe that I do not now refuse to address you from any disposition to\r\ndisoblige you, but to the contrary. But, at the same time, I beg of you to\r\nexcuse me for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT NEW YORK CITY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN:--I am rather an old man to avail myself of\r\nsuch an excuse as I am now about to do. Yet the truth is so distinct, and\r\npresses itself so distinctly upon me, that I cannot well avoid it--and\r\nthat is, that I did not understand when I was brought into this room that\r\nI was to be brought here to make a speech. It was not intimated to me that\r\nI was brought into the room where Daniel Webster and Henry Clay had made\r\nspeeches, and where one in my position might be expected to do something\r\nlike those men or say something worthy of myself or my audience. I\r\ntherefore beg you to make allowance for the circumstances in which I\r\nhave been by surprise brought before you. Now I have been in the habit\r\nof thinking and sometimes speaking upon political questions that have for\r\nsome years past agitated the country; and, if I were disposed to do so,\r\nand we could take up some one of the issues, as the lawyers call them, and\r\nI were called upon to make an argument about it to the best of my ability,\r\nI could do so without much preparation. But that is not what you desire to\r\nhave done here to-night.\r\n\r\nI have been occupying a position, since the Presidential election, of\r\nsilence--of avoiding public speaking, of avoiding public writing. I have\r\nbeen doing so because I thought, upon full consideration, that was the\r\nproper course for me to take. I am brought before you now, and required\r\nto make a speech, when you all approve more than anything else of the fact\r\nthat I have been keeping silence. And now it seems to me that the response\r\nyou give to that remark ought to justify me in closing just here. I\r\nhave not kept silence since the Presidential election from any party\r\nwantonness, or from any indifference to the anxiety that pervades the\r\nminds of men about the aspect of the political affairs of this country. I\r\nhave kept silence for the reason that I supposed it was peculiarly proper\r\nthat I should do so until the time came when, according to the custom of\r\nthe country, I could speak officially.\r\n\r\nI still suppose that, while the political drama being enacted in this\r\ncountry at this time is rapidly shifting its scenes--forbidding an\r\nanticipation with any degree of certainty to-day of what we shall see\r\nto-morrow--it is peculiarly fitting that I should see it all, up to the\r\nlast minute, before I should take ground that I might be disposed, by the\r\nshifting of the scenes afterward, also to shift. I have said several times\r\nupon this journey, and I now repeat it to you, that when the time does\r\ncome, I shall then take the ground that I think is right--right for the\r\nNorth, for the South, for the East, for the West, for the whole country.\r\nAnd in doing so I hope to feel no necessity pressing upon me to say\r\nanything in conflict with the Constitution, in conflict with the continued\r\nunion of these States, in conflict with the perpetuation of the liberties\r\nof this people, or anything in conflict with anything whatever that I have\r\never given you reason to expect from me. And now, my friends, have I said\r\nenough? [Loud cries of \"No, no!\" and, \"Three cheers for LINCOLN!\"] Now, my\r\nfriends, there appears to be a difference of opinion between you and me,\r\nand I really feel called upon to decide the question myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 20, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. MAYOR:--It is with feelings of deep gratitude that I make my\r\nacknowledgments for the reception that has been given me in the great\r\ncommercial city of New York. I cannot but remember that it is done by\r\nthe people who do not, by a large majority, agree with me in political\r\nsentiment. It is the more grateful to me because in this I see that for\r\nthe great principles of our Government the people are pretty nearly or\r\nquite unanimous. In regard to the difficulties that confront us at this\r\ntime, and of which you have seen fit to speak so becomingly and so justly,\r\nI can only say I agree with the sentiments expressed. In my devotion to\r\nthe Union I hope I am behind no man in the nation. As to my wisdom in\r\nconducting affairs so as to tend to the preservation of the Union, I fear\r\ntoo great confidence may have been placed in me. I am sure I bring a\r\nheart devoted to the work. There is nothing that could ever bring me to\r\nconsent--willingly to consent--to the destruction of this Union (in which\r\nnot only the great city of New York, but the whole country, has acquired\r\nits greatness), unless it would be that thing for which the Union\r\nitself was made. I understand that the ship is made for the carrying and\r\npreservation of the cargo; and so long as the ship is safe with the cargo,\r\nit shall not be abandoned. This Union shall never be abandoned, unless the\r\npossibility of its existence shall cease to exist without the necessity of\r\nthrowing passengers and cargo overboard. So long, then, as it is possible\r\nthat the prosperity and liberties of this people can be preserved within\r\nthis Union, it shall be my purpose at all tunes to preserve it. And now,\r\nMr. Mayor, renewing my thanks for this cordial reception, allow me to come\r\nto a close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1860\r\n\r\nMR. DAYTON AND GENTLEMEN OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY:--I shall only thank\r\nyou briefly for this very kind reception given me, not personally, but as\r\nthe temporary representative of the majesty of the nation. To the kindness\r\nof your hearts, and of the hearts of your brethren in your State, I should\r\nbe very proud to respond, but I shall not have strength to address you\r\nor other assemblages at length, even if I had the time to do so. I appear\r\nbefore you, therefore, for little else than to greet you, and to briefly\r\nsay farewell. You have done me the very high honor to present your\r\nreception courtesies to me through your great man a man with whom it is an\r\nhonor to be associated anywhere, and in owning whom no State can be poor.\r\nHe has said enough, and by the saying of it suggested enough, to require a\r\nresponse of an hour, well considered. I could not in an hour make a worthy\r\nresponse to it. I therefore, ladies and gentlemen of New Jersey, content\r\nmyself with saying, most heartily do I indorse all the sentiments he has\r\nexpressed. Allow me, most gratefully, to bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MAYOR OF NEWARK, NEW JERSEY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1861.\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR:--I thank you for this reception at the city of Newark. With\r\nregard to the great work of which you speak, I will say that I bring to it\r\na heart filled with love for my country, and an honest desire to do what\r\nis right. I am sure, however, that I have not the ability to do anything\r\nunaided of God, and that without His support and that of this free, happy,\r\nprosperous, and intelligent people, no man can succeed in doing that\r\nthe importance of which we all comprehend. Again thanking you for the\r\nreception you have given me, I will now bid you farewell, and proceed upon\r\nmy journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS IN TRENTON AT THE TRENTON HOUSE,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1861\r\n\r\nI have been invited by your representatives to the Legislature to visit\r\nthis the capital of your honored State, and in acknowledging their kind\r\ninvitation, compelled to respond to the welcome of the presiding officers\r\nof each body, and I suppose they intended I should speak to you through\r\nthem, as they are the representatives of all of you; and if I were to\r\nspeak again here, I should only have to repeat in a great measure much\r\nthat I have said, which would be disgusting to my friends around me who\r\nhave met here. I have no speech to make, but merely appear to see you and\r\nlet you look at me; and as to the latter I think I have greatly the best\r\nof the bargain. My friends, allow me to bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE SENATE OF NEW JERSEY\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY:--I\r\nam very grateful to you for the honorable reception of which I have been\r\nthe object. I cannot but remember the place that New Jersey holds in our\r\nearly history. In the Revolutionary struggle few of the States among the\r\nOld Thirteen had more of the battle-fields of the country within their\r\nlimits than New Jersey. May I be pardoned if, upon this occasion, I\r\nmention that away back in my childhood, the earliest days of my being\r\nable to read, I got hold of a small book, such a one as few of the younger\r\nmembers have ever seen Weems's Life of Washington. I remember all the\r\naccounts there given of the battle-fields and struggles for the liberties\r\nof the country; and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as\r\nthe struggle here at Trenton, New Jersey. The crossing of the river, the\r\ncontest with the Hessians, the great hardships endured at that time, all\r\nfixed themselves on my memory more than any single Revolutionary event;\r\nand you all know, for you have all been boys, how these early impressions\r\nlast longer than any others. I recollect thinking then, boy even though I\r\nwas, that there must have been something more than common that these men\r\nstruggled for. I am exceedingly anxious that that thing that something\r\neven more than national independence, that something that held out a\r\ngreat promise to all the people of the world to all time to come--I am\r\nexceedingly anxious that this Union, the Constitution, and the liberties\r\nof the people shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original idea\r\nfor which that struggle was made; and I shall be most happy indeed if I\r\nshall be a humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty, and of this his\r\nalmost chosen people, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle.\r\nYou give me this reception, as I understand, without distinction of party.\r\nI learn that this body is composed of a majority of gentlemen who, in the\r\nexercise of their best judgment in the choice of a chief magistrate,\r\ndid not think I was the man. I understand, nevertheless, that they come\r\nforward here to greet me as the constitutionally elected President of the\r\nUnited States--as citizens of the United States to meet the man who, for\r\nthe time being, is the representative of the majesty of the nation--united\r\nby the single purpose to perpetuate the Constitution, the union, and the\r\nliberties of the people. As such, I accept this reception more gratefully\r\nthan I could do did I believe it were tendered to me as an individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE ASSEMBLY OF NEW JERSEY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER AND GENTLEMEN: I have just enjoyed the honor of a reception\r\nby the other branch of this Legislature, and I return to you and them my\r\nthanks for the reception which the people of New Jersey have given through\r\ntheir chosen representatives to me as the representative, for the time\r\nbeing, of the majesty of the people of the United States. I appropriate to\r\nmyself very little of the demonstrations of respect with which I have been\r\ngreeted. I think little should be given to any man, but that it should\r\nbe a manifestation of adherence to the Union and the Constitution. I\r\nunderstand myself to be received here by the representatives of the people\r\nof New Jersey, a majority of whom differ in opinion from those with whom\r\nI have acted. This manifestation is therefore to be regarded by me\r\nas expressing their devotion to the Union, the Constitution, and the\r\nliberties of the people.\r\n\r\nYou, Mr. Speaker, have well said that this is a time when the bravest and\r\nwisest look with doubt and awe upon the aspect presented by our national\r\naffairs. Under these circumstances you will readily see why I should not\r\nspeak in detail of the course I shall deem it best to pursue. It is proper\r\nthat I should avail myself of all the information and all the time at\r\nmy command, in order that when the time arrives in which I must speak\r\nofficially, I shall be able to take the ground which I deem best and\r\nsafest, and from which I may have no occasion to swerve. I shall endeavor\r\nto take the ground I deem most just to the North, the East, the West, the\r\nSouth, and the whole country. I shall take it, I hope, in good temper,\r\ncertainly with no malice toward any section. I shall do all that may be in\r\nmy power to promote a peaceful settlement of all our difficulties. The man\r\ndoes not live who is more devoted to peace than I am, none who would do\r\nmore to preserve it, but it may be necessary to put the foot down firmly.\r\nAnd if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not? [Loud\r\ncheers, and cries of \"Yes, yes; we will.\"] Received as I am by the members\r\nof a Legislature the majority of whom do not agree with me in political\r\nsentiments, I trust that I may have their assistance in piloting the ship\r\nof state through this voyage, surrounded by perils as it is; for if it\r\nshould suffer wreck now, there will be no pilot ever needed for another\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have already spoken longer than I intended, and must beg\r\nleave to stop here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA:--I appear before you to\r\nmake no lengthy speech, but to thank you for this reception. The reception\r\nyou have given me to-night is not to me, the man, the individual, but to\r\nthe man who temporarily represents, or should represent, the majesty of\r\nthe nation. It is true, as your worthy mayor has said, that there is great\r\nanxiety amongst the citizens of the United States at this time. I deem it\r\na happy circumstance that this dissatisfied portion of our fellow-citizens\r\ndoes not point us to anything in which they are being injured or about\r\nto be injured; for which reason I have felt all the while justified in\r\nconcluding that the crisis, the panic, the anxiety of the country at\r\nthis time is artificial. If there be those who differ with me upon this\r\nsubject, they have not pointed out the substantial difficulty that exists.\r\nI do not mean to say that an artificial panic may not do considerable\r\nharm; that it has done such I do not deny. The hope that has been\r\nexpressed by your mayor, that I may be able to restore peace, harmony, and\r\nprosperity to the country, is most worthy of him; and most happy, indeed,\r\nwill I be if I shall be able to verify and fulfil that hope. I promise\r\nyou that I bring to the work a sincere heart. Whether I will bring a head\r\nequal to that heart will be for future times to determine. It were useless\r\nfor me to speak of details of plans now; I shall speak officially next\r\nMonday week, if ever. If I should not speak then, it were useless for me\r\nto do so now. If I do speak then, it is useless for me to do so now. When\r\nI do speak, I shall take such ground as I deem best calculated to restore\r\npeace, harmony, and prosperity to the country, and tend to the perpetuity\r\nof the nation and the liberty of these States and these people. Your\r\nworthy mayor has expressed the wish, in which I join with him, that it\r\nwere convenient for me to remain in your city long enough to consult your\r\nmerchants and manufacturers; or, as it were, to listen to those breathings\r\nrising within the consecrated walls wherein the Constitution of the United\r\nStates and, I will add, the Declaration of Independence, were originally\r\nframed and adopted. I assure you and your mayor that I had hoped on this\r\noccasion, and upon all occasions during my life, that I shall do nothing\r\ninconsistent with the teachings of these holy and most sacred walls. I\r\nhave never asked anything that does not breathe from those walls. All my\r\npolitical warfare has been in favor of the teachings that come forth from\r\nthese sacred walls. May my right hand forget its cunning and my tongue\r\ncleave to the roof of my mouth if ever I prove false to those teachings.\r\nFellow-citizens, I have addressed you longer than I expected to do, and\r\nnow allow me to bid you goodnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS IN THE HALL OF INDEPENDENCE, PHILADELPHIA,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. CUYLER:--I am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing\r\nhere, in this place, where were collected together the wisdom, the\r\ndevotion to principle, from which sprang the institutions under which\r\nwe live. You have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of\r\nrestoring peace to the present distracted condition of the country. I can\r\nsay in return, sir, that all the political sentiments I entertain have\r\nbeen drawn, so far as I have been able to draw them, from the sentiments\r\nwhich originated and were given to the world from this hall. I have never\r\nhad a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied\r\nin the Declaration of Independence. I have often pondered over the dangers\r\nwhich were incurred by the men who assembled here and framed and adopted\r\nthat Declaration of Independence. I have pondered over the toils that\r\nwere endured by the officers and soldiers of the army who achieved that\r\nindependence. I have often inquired of myself what great principle or idea\r\nit was that kept the confederacy so long together. It was not the mere\r\nmatter of separation of the colonies from the motherland, but that\r\nsentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone\r\nto the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world for all future\r\ntime. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be\r\nlifted from the shoulders of all men. This is the sentiment embodied in\r\nthe Declaration of Independence. Now, my friends, can the country be saved\r\nupon that basis? If it can, I will consider myself one of the happiest\r\nmen in the world if I can help to save it. If it cannot be saved upon that\r\nprinciple, it will be truly awful. But if this country cannot be saved\r\nwithout giving up that principle, I was about to say I would rather\r\nbe assassinated on this spot than surrender it. Now, in my view of the\r\npresent aspect of affairs, there need be no bloodshed or war. There is no\r\nnecessity for it. I am not in favor of such a course, and I may say, in\r\nadvance, that there will be no bloodshed unless it is forced upon the\r\nGovernment, and then it will be compelled to act in self-defence.\r\n\r\nMy friends; this is wholly an unexpected speech, and I did not expect to\r\nbe called upon to say a word when I came here. I supposed it was merely\r\nto do something toward raising the flag. I may, therefore, have said\r\nsomething indiscreet. I have said nothing but what I am willing to live by\r\nand, if it be the pleasure of Almighty God, die by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE WILMINGTON DELEGATION,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN:--I feel highly flattered by the encomiums you have seen fit\r\nto bestow upon me. Soon after the nomination of General Taylor, I attended\r\na political meeting in the city of Wilmington, and have since carried with\r\nme a fond remembrance of the hospitalities of the city on that occasion.\r\nThe programme established provides for my presence in Harrisburg in\r\ntwenty-four hours from this time. I expect to be in Washington on\r\nSaturday. It is, therefore, an impossibility that I should accept your\r\nkind invitation. There are no people whom I would more gladly accommodate\r\nthan those of Delaware; but circumstances forbid, gentlemen. With many\r\nregrets for the character of the reply I am compelled to give you, I bid\r\nyou adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1860\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF OLD LANCASTER:--I appear not to make a speech. I\r\nhave not time to make a speech at length, and not strength to make them on\r\nevery occasion; and, worse than all, I have none to make. There is plenty\r\nof matter to speak about in these times, but it is well known that the\r\nmore a man speaks the less he is understood--the more he says one thing,\r\nthe more his adversaries contend he meant something else. I shall soon\r\nhave occasion to speak officially, and then I will endeavor to put my\r\nthoughts just as plain as I can express myself--true to the Constitution\r\nand Union of all the States, and to the perpetual liberty of all the\r\npeople. Until I so speak, there is no need to enter upon details. In\r\nconclusion, I greet you most heartily, and bid you an affectionate\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE LEGISLATURE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AT HARRISBURG,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER OF THE SENATE, AND ALSO MR. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF\r\nREPRESENTATIVES, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF\r\nPENNSYLVANIA:--I appear before you only for a very few brief remarks in\r\nresponse to what has been said to me. I thank you most sincerely for this\r\nreception, and the generous words in which support has been promised me\r\nupon this occasion. I thank your great commonwealth for the overwhelming\r\nsupport it recently gave, not me personally, but the cause which I think a\r\njust one, in the late election.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to the fact--the interesting fact perhaps we\r\nshould say--that I for the first time appear at the capital of the great\r\ncommonwealth of Pennsylvania upon the birthday of the Father of his\r\nCountry. In connection with that beloved anniversary connected with the\r\nhistory of this country, I have already gone through one exceedingly\r\ninteresting scene this morning in the ceremonies at Philadelphia. Under\r\nthe kind conduct of gentlemen there, I was for the first time allowed\r\nthe privilege of standing in old Independence Hall to have a few words\r\naddressed to me there, and opening up to me an opportunity of manifesting\r\nmy deep regret that I had not more time to express something of my own\r\nfeelings excited by the occasion, that had been really the feelings of my\r\nwhole life.\r\n\r\nBesides this, our friends there had provided a magnificent flag of the\r\ncountry. They had arranged it so that I was given the honor of raising it\r\nto the head of its staff, and when it went up I was pleased that it went\r\nto its place by the strength of my own feeble arm. When, according to the\r\narrangement, the cord was pulled, and it floated gloriously to the wind,\r\nwithout an accident, in the bright, glowing sunshine of the morning,\r\nI could not help hoping that there was in the entire success of that\r\nbeautiful ceremony at least something of an omen of what is to come. Nor\r\ncould I help feeling then, as I have often felt, that in the whole of that\r\nproceeding I was a very humbled instrument. I had not provided the flag; I\r\nhad not made the arrangements for elevating it to its place; I had applied\r\nbut a very small portion of even my feeble strength in raising it. In the\r\nwhole transaction I was in the hands of the people who had arranged it,\r\nand if I can have the same generous co-operation of the people of\r\nthis nation, I think the flag of our country may yet be kept flaunting\r\ngloriously.\r\n\r\nI recur for a moment but to repeat some words uttered at the hotel in\r\nregard to what has been said about the military support which the General\r\nGovernment may expect from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a proper\r\nemergency. To guard against any possible mistake do I recur to this. It is\r\nnot with any pleasure that I contemplate the possibility that a necessity\r\nmay arise in this country for the use of the military arm. While I am\r\nexceedingly gratified to see the manifestation upon your streets of your\r\nmilitary force here, and exceedingly gratified at your promise to use that\r\nforce upon a proper emergency--while I make these acknowledgments I desire\r\nto repeat, in order to preclude any possible misconstruction, that I do\r\nmost sincerely hope that we shall have no use for them; that it will\r\nnever become their duty to shed blood, and most especially never to shed\r\nfraternal blood. I promise that so far as I may have wisdom to direct,\r\nif so painful a result shall in any wise be brought about, it shall be\r\nthrough no fault of mine.\r\n\r\nAllusion has also been made by one of your honored speakers to some\r\nremarks recently made by myself at Pittsburg in regard to what is supposed\r\nto be the especial interest of this great commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I\r\nnow wish only to say in regard to that matter, that the few remarks which\r\nI uttered on that occasion were rather carefully worded. I took pains\r\nthat they should be so. I have seen no occasion since to add to them or\r\nsubtract from them. I leave them precisely as they stand, adding only\r\nnow that I am pleased to have an expression from you, gentlemen of\r\nPennsylvania, signifying that they are satisfactory to you.\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentlemen of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania, allow me again to return to you my most sincere thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MAYOR OF WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 27, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. MAYOR:--I thank you, and through you the municipal authorities of this\r\ncity who accompany you, for this welcome. And as it is the first time in\r\nmy life, since the present phase of politics has presented itself in this\r\ncountry, that I have said anything publicly within a region of country\r\nwhere the institution of slavery exists, I will take this occasion to\r\nsay that I think very much of the ill feeling that has existed and still\r\nexists between the people in the section from which I came and the people\r\nhere, is dependent upon a misunderstanding of one another. I therefore\r\navail myself of this opportunity to assure you, Mr. Mayor, and all the\r\ngentlemen present, that I have not now, and never have had, any other than\r\nas kindly feelings toward you as to the people of my own section. I have\r\nnot now, and never have had, any disposition to treat you in any respect\r\notherwise than as my own neighbors. I have not now any purpose to withhold\r\nfrom you any of the benefits of the Constitution, under any circumstances,\r\nthat I would not feel myself constrained to withhold from my own\r\nneighbors; and I hope, in a word, that when we shall become better\r\nacquainted--and I say it with great confidence--we shall like each other\r\nbetter. I thank you for the kindness of this reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A SERENADE AT WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 28, 1861\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS:--I suppose that I may take this as a compliment paid to me,\r\nand as such please accept my thanks for it. I have reached this city of\r\nWashington under circumstances considerably differing from those under\r\nwhich any other man has ever reached it. I am here for the purpose of\r\ntaking an official position amongst the people, almost all of whom were\r\npolitically opposed to me, and are yet opposed to me, as I suppose.\r\n\r\nI propose no lengthy address to you. I only propose to say, as I did on\r\nyesterday, when your worthy mayor and board of aldermen called upon me,\r\nthat I thought much of the ill feeling that has existed between you and\r\nthe people of your surroundings and that people from among whom I came,\r\nhas depended, and now depends, upon a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nI hope that, if things shall go along as prosperously as I believe we all\r\ndesire they may, I may have it in my power to remove something of this\r\nmisunderstanding; that I may be enabled to convince you, and the people\r\nof your section of the country, that we regard you as in all things\r\nour equals, and in all things entitled to the same respect and the same\r\ntreatment that we claim for ourselves; that we are in no wise disposed, if\r\nit were in our power, to oppress you, to deprive you of any of your rights\r\nunder the Constitution of the United States, or even narrowly to split\r\nhairs with you in regard to these rights, but are determined to give you,\r\nas far as lies in our hands, all your rights under the Constitution--not\r\ngrudgingly, but fully and fairly. I hope that, by thus dealing with you,\r\nwe will become better acquainted, and be better friends.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my friends, with these few remarks, and again returning my thanks\r\nfor this compliment, and expressing my desire to hear a little more of\r\nyour good music, I bid you good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, SUNDAY, MARCH 3, 1861\r\n\r\n[During the struggle over the appointments of LINCOLN's Cabinet, the\r\nPresident-elect spoke as follows:]\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is evident that some one must take the responsibility\r\nof these appointments, and I will do it. My Cabinet is completed. The\r\npositions are not definitely assigned, and will not be until I announce\r\nthem privately to the gentlemen whom I have selected as my Constitutional\r\nadvisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS, MARCH 4, 1861\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES:--In compliance with a custom as old\r\nas the Government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly, and\r\nto take in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of\r\nthe United States to be taken by the President \"before he enters on the\r\nexecution of his office.\"\r\n\r\nI do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters\r\nof administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement.\r\n\r\nApprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that\r\nby the accession of a Republican administration their property and their\r\npeace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any\r\nreasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to\r\nthe contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection.\r\nIt is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses\r\nyou. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that\r\n\r\n\"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the\r\ninstitution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no\r\nlawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThose who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had\r\nmade this and many similar declarations, and had never recanted them. And,\r\nmore than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a\r\nlaw to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and\r\nespecially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic\r\ninstitutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential\r\nto that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our\r\npolitical fabric depend, and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\r\nforce of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext,\r\nas amongst the gravest of crimes.\"\r\n\r\nI now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\r\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is\r\nsusceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are to\r\nbe in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration. I add, too,\r\nthat all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution and\r\nthe laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States when\r\nlawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one section as to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from\r\nservice or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the\r\nConstitution as any other of its provisions:\r\n\r\n\"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof,\r\nescaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation\r\ntherein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered\r\nup on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those\r\nwho made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the\r\nintention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear their\r\nsupport to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as to any\r\nother. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the\r\nterms of this clause \"shall be delivered up,\" their oaths are unanimous.\r\nNow, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not with\r\nnearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good\r\nthat unanimous oath?\r\n\r\nThere is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced\r\nby national or by State authority; but surely that difference is not a\r\nvery material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but\r\nlittle consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done. And\r\nshould any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a\r\nmerely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?\r\n\r\nAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\r\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so\r\nthat a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave? And might it\r\nnot be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that\r\nclause in the Constitution which guarantees that \"the citizens of each\r\nState shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in\r\nthe several States\"?\r\n\r\nI take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with no\r\npurpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules.\r\nAnd, while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as\r\nproper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all,\r\nboth in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all\r\nthose acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting\r\nto find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIt is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\r\nunder our national Constitution. During that period fifteen different\r\nand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government. They have conducted it through many\r\nperils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope of\r\nprecedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional\r\nterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of\r\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\r\n\r\nI hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\r\nthe Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not\r\nexpressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe\r\nto assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic\r\nlaw for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express\r\nprovisions of our national Constitution, and the Union will endure\r\nforever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not\r\nprovided for in the instrument itself.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association\r\nof States in the nature of contract merely, can it as a contract be\r\npeaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it? One party to\r\na contract may violate it--break it, so to speak; but does it not require\r\nall to lawfully rescind it?\r\n\r\nDescending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in\r\nlegal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of\r\nthe Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was\r\nformed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured\r\nand continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further\r\nmatured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted\r\nand engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation\r\nin 1778. And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining\r\nand establishing the Constitution was \"to form a more perfect Union.\"\r\n\r\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the\r\nStates be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the\r\nConstitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can\r\nlawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect\r\nare legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or States,\r\nagainst the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or\r\nrevolutionary, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the\r\nUnion is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as\r\nthe Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the\r\nUnion be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to\r\nbe only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it so far as\r\npracticable, unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall\r\nwithhold the requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the\r\ncontrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\r\ndeclared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and\r\nmaintain itself.\r\n\r\nIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\r\nshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power\r\nconfided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and\r\nplaces belonging to the Government, and to collect the duties and imposts;\r\nbut beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no\r\ninvasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere. Where\r\nhostility to the United States, in any interior locality, shall be so\r\ngreat and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding\r\nthe Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers\r\namong the people for that object. While the strict legal right may exist\r\nin the government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to\r\ndo so would be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that I\r\ndeem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices.\r\n\r\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of\r\nthe Union. So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\r\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and\r\nreflection. The course here indicated will be followed unless current\r\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\r\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\r\naccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope\r\nof a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of\r\nfraternal sympathies and affections.\r\n\r\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the\r\nUnion at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither\r\naffirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them. To\r\nthose, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national\r\nfabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not\r\nbe wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate\r\na step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly\r\nfrom have no real existence? Will you, while the certain ills you fly\r\nto are greater than all the real ones you fly from--will you risk the\r\ncommission of so fearful a mistake?\r\n\r\nAll profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can\r\nbe maintained. Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the\r\nConstitution, has been denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is so\r\nconstituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. Think,\r\nif you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of\r\nthe Constitution has ever been denied. If by the mere force of numbers a\r\nmajority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional\r\nright, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly\r\nwould if such a right were a vital one. But such is not our case. All the\r\nvital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to\r\nthem by affirmations and negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the\r\nConstitution, that controversies never arise concerning them. But no\r\norganic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to\r\nevery question which may occur in practical administration. No foresight\r\ncan anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain, express\r\nprovisions for all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be\r\nsurrendered by national or by State authority? The Constitution does\r\nnot expressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories? The\r\nConstitution does not expressly say. Must Congress protect slavery in the\r\nTerritories? The Constitution does not expressly say.\r\n\r\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,\r\nand we divide upon them into majorities and minorities. If the minority\r\nwill not acquiesce, the majority must, or the Government must cease. There\r\nis no other alternative; for continuing the Government is acquiescence on\r\none side or the other.\r\n\r\nIf a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a\r\nprecedent which in turn will divide and ruin them; for a minority of their\r\nown will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by\r\nsuch minority. For instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy\r\na year or two hence arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of\r\nthe present Union now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion\r\nsentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this.\r\n\r\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose a\r\nnew Union as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession?\r\n\r\nPlainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A\r\nmajority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and\r\nalways changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and\r\nsentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects\r\nit does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is\r\nimpossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly\r\ninadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or\r\ndespotism in some form is all that is left.\r\n\r\nI do not forget the position assumed by some, that constitutional\r\nquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny that such\r\ndecisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to\r\nthe object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect\r\nand consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the\r\ngovernment. And, while it is obviously possible that such decision may\r\nbe erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being\r\nlimited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled\r\nand never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than\r\ncould the evils of a different practice. At the same time, the candid\r\ncitizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital\r\nquestions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary\r\nlitigation between parties in personal actions, the people will have\r\nceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned\r\nthe government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor is there in\r\nthis view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a duty from\r\nwhich they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them,\r\nand it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to\r\npolitical purposes.\r\n\r\nOne section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be\r\nextended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be\r\nextended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause\r\nof the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave\r\ntrade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a\r\ncommunity where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law\r\nitself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\r\nin both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be\r\nperfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation\r\nof the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly\r\nsuppressed, would be ultimately revived, without restriction, in one\r\nsection, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not\r\nbe surrendered at all by the other.\r\n\r\nPhysically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective\r\nsections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A\r\nhusband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond\r\nthe reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot\r\ndo this. They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either\r\namicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible, then,\r\nto make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after\r\nseparation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can\r\nmake laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than\r\nlaws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always;\r\nand when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease\r\nfighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again\r\nupon you.\r\n\r\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit\r\nit. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can\r\nexercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary\r\nright to dismember or overthrow it. I cannot be ignorant of the fact that\r\nmany worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national\r\nConstitution amended. While I make no recommendation of amendments,\r\nI fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole\r\nsubject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the\r\ninstrument itself, and I should, under existing circumstances, favor\r\nrather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act\r\nupon it. I will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems\r\npreferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with the people\r\nthemselves, instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions\r\noriginated by others not especially chosen for the purpose, and which\r\nmight not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse.\r\nI understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution which amendment,\r\nhowever, I have not seen--has passed Congress, to the effect that the\r\nFederal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions\r\nof the States, including that of persons held to service. To avoid\r\nmisconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak\r\nof particular amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision\r\nto now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being\r\nmade express and irrevocable.\r\n\r\nThe chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and\r\nthey have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the\r\nStates. The people themselves can do this also if they choose; but the\r\nexecutive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer\r\nthe present government, as it came to his hands, and to transmit it,\r\nunimpaired by him, to his successors.\r\n\r\nWhy should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of\r\nthe people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? In our present\r\ndifferences is either party without faith of being in the right? If the\r\nAlmighty Ruler of nations, with his eternal truth and justice, be on your\r\nside of the North, or on yours of the South, that truth and that justice\r\nwill surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBy the frame of the government under which we live, this same people have\r\nwisely given their public servants but little power for mischief; and\r\nhave, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to their\r\nown hands at very short intervals. While the people retain their virtue\r\nand vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly,\r\ncan very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole subject.\r\nNothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an object\r\nto hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take\r\ndeliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good\r\nobject can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied still\r\nhave the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the\r\nlaws of your own framing under it; while the new administration will have\r\nno immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted\r\nthat you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there\r\nstill is no single good reason for precipitate action. Intelligence,\r\npatriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet\r\nforsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust in the best way\r\nall our present difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the\r\nmomentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you. You can\r\nhave no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath\r\nregistered in heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the\r\nmost solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" it.\r\n\r\nI am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be\r\nenemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break, our bonds of\r\naffection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field\r\nand patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this\r\nbroad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as\r\nsurely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFUSAL OF SEWARD RESIGNATION\r\n\r\nTO WM. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, March 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your note of the 2d instant, asking to withdraw your\r\nacceptance of my invitation to take charge of the State Department, was\r\nduly received. It is the subject of the most painful solicitude with me,\r\nand I feel constrained to beg that you will countermand the withdrawal.\r\nThe public interest, I think, demands that you should; and my personal\r\nfeelings are deeply enlisted in the same direction. Please consider and\r\nanswer by 9 A.M. to-morrow.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE PENNSYLVANIA DELEGATION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MARCH 5, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE PENNSYLVANIAN DELEGATION:--As I have so\r\nfrequently said heretofore, when I have had occasion to address the people\r\nof the Keystone, in my visits to that State, I can now but repeat the\r\nassurance of my gratification at the support you gave me at the election,\r\nand at the promise of a continuation of that support which is now tendered\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to the hope that you entertain that you have a\r\nPresident and a government. In respect to that I wish to say to you that\r\nin the position I have assumed I wish to do more than I have ever given\r\nreason to believe I would do. I do not wish you to believe that I assume\r\nto be any better than others who have gone before me. I prefer rather to\r\nhave it understood that if we ever have a government on the principles we\r\nprofess, we should remember, while we exercise our opinion, that others\r\nhave also rights to the exercise of their opinions, and that we should\r\nendeavor to allow these rights, and act in such a manner as to create no\r\nbad feeling. I hope we have a government and a President. I hope, and\r\nwish it to be understood, that there may be no allusion to unpleasant\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that the people of all the States are entitled to all the\r\nprivileges and immunities of the citizens of the several States. We should\r\nbear this in mind, and act in such a way as to say nothing insulting\r\nor irritating. I would inculcate this idea, so that we may not, like\r\nPharisees, set ourselves up to be better than other people.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, my public duties are pressing to-day, and will prevent\r\nmy giving more time to you. Indeed, I should not have left them now, but I\r\ncould not well deny myself to so large and respectable a body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MASSACHUSETTS DELEGATION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MARCH 5, 1861\r\n\r\nI am thankful for this renewed assurance of kind feeling and confidence,\r\nand the support of the old Bay State, in so far as you, Mr. Chairman, have\r\nexpressed, in behalf of those whom you represent, your sanction of what\r\nI have enunciated in my inaugural address. This is very grateful to my\r\nfeelings. The object was one of great delicacy, in presenting views at the\r\nopening of an administration under the peculiar circumstances attending my\r\nentrance upon the official duties connected with the Government. I studied\r\nall the points with great anxiety, and presented them with whatever\r\nof ability and sense of justice I could bring to bear. If it met the\r\napprobation of our good friends in Massachusetts, I shall be exceedingly\r\ngratified, while I hope it will meet the approbation of friends\r\neverywhere. I am thankful for the expressions of those who have voted\r\nwith us; and like every other man of you, I like them as certainly as I do\r\nothers. As the President in the administration of the Government, I\r\nhope to be man enough not to know one citizen of the United States from\r\nanother, nor one section from another. I shall be gratified to have good\r\nfriends of Massachusetts and others who have thus far supported me in\r\nthese national views still to support me in carrying them out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE CHAMBER, MARCH 7, 1861\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Herewith is the diplomatic address and my reply. To whom the\r\nreply should be addressed--that is, by what title or style--I do not quite\r\nunderstand, and therefore I have left it blank.\r\n\r\nWill you please bring with you to-day the message from the War Department,\r\nwith General Scott's note upon it, which we had here yesterday? I wish to\r\nexamine the General's opinion, which I have not yet done.\r\n\r\nYours very truly\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 7, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. FIGANIERE AND GENTLEMEN OF THE DIPLOMATIC BODY:--Please accept my\r\nsincere thanks for your kind congratulations. It affords me pleasure\r\nto confirm the confidence you so generously express in the friendly\r\ndisposition of the United States, through me, towards the sovereigns and\r\ngovernments you respectively represent. With equal satisfaction I accept\r\nthe assurance you are pleased to give, that the same disposition is\r\nreciprocated by your sovereigns, your governments, and yourselves.\r\n\r\nAllow me to express the hope that these friendly relations may remain\r\nundisturbed, and also my fervent wishes for the health and happiness of\r\nyourselves personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 11,1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF STATE. DEAR SIR:--What think you of sending ministers\r\nat once as follows: Dayton to England; Fremont to France; Clay to Spain;\r\nCorwin to Mexico?\r\n\r\nWe need to have these points guarded as strongly and quickly as possible.\r\nThis is suggestion merely, and not dictation.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. COLLAMER\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 12, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. JACOB COLLAMER. MY DEAR SIR:--God help me. It is said I have offended\r\nyou. I hope you will tell me how.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 14, 1861. DEAR SIR:--I am entirely unconscious that you have any way\r\noffended me. I cherish no sentiment towards you but that of kindness and\r\nconfidence. Your humble servant, J. COLLAMER.\r\n\r\n [Returned with indorsement:]\r\n\r\nVery glad to know that I have n't.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 13, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. P. M. G.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--The bearer of this, Mr. C. T. Hempstow, is a Virginian who\r\nwishes to get, for his son, a small place in your Dept. I think Virginia\r\nshould be heard, in such cases.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ASKING CABINET OPINIONS ON FORT SUMTER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 15, 1861\r\n\r\nTHE HONORABLE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Assuming it to be possible to now provision Fort Sumter,\r\nunder all the circumstances is it wise to attempt it? Please give me your\r\nopinion in writing on this question.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Same to other members of the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON ROYAL ARBITRATION OF AMERICAN BOUNDARY LINE\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nThe Senate has transmitted to me a copy of the message sent by my\r\npredecessor to that body on the 21st of February last, proposing to take\r\nits advice on the subject of a proposition made by the British Government\r\nthrough its minister here to refer the matter in controversy between that\r\ngovernment and the Government of the United States to the arbitrament\r\nof the King of Sweden and Norway, the King of the Netherlands, or the\r\nRepublic of the Swiss Confederation.\r\n\r\nIn that message my predecessor stated that he wished to present to the\r\nSenate the precise questions following, namely:\r\n\r\n\"Will the Senate approve a treaty referring to either of the sovereign\r\npowers above named the dispute now existing between the governments of\r\nthe United States and Great Britain concerning the boundary line between\r\nVancouver's Island and the American continent? In case the referee shall\r\nfind himself unable to decide where the line is by the description of it\r\nin the treaty of June 15, 1846, shall he be authorized to establish a line\r\naccording to the treaty as nearly as possible? Which of the three powers\r\nnamed by Great Britain as an arbiter shall be chosen by the United\r\nStates?\"\r\n\r\nI find no reason to disapprove of the course of my predecessor in this\r\nimportant matter; but, on the contrary, I not only shall receive the\r\nadvice of the Senate thereon cheerfully, but I respectfully ask the Senate\r\nfor their advice on the three questions before recited.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 16, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBASSADORIAL APPOINTMENTS\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 18, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I believe it is a necessity with us to make the appointments\r\nI mentioned last night--that is, Charles F. Adams to England, William L.\r\nDayton to France, George P. Marsh to Sardinia, and Anson Burlingame to\r\nAustria. These gentlemen all have my highest esteem, but no one of them is\r\noriginally suggested by me except Mr. Dayton. Mr. Adams I take because you\r\nsuggested him, coupled with his eminent fitness for the place. Mr.\r\nMarsh and Mr. Burlingame I take because of the intense pressure of their\r\nrespective States, and their fitness also.\r\n\r\nThe objection to this card is that locally they are so huddled up--three\r\nbeing in New England and two from a single State. I have considered this,\r\nand will not shrink from the responsibility. This, being done, leaves but\r\nfive full missions undisposed of--Rome, China, Brazil, Peru, and Chili.\r\nAnd then what about Carl Schurz; or, in other words, what about our German\r\nfriends?\r\n\r\nShall we put the card through, and arrange the rest afterward? What say\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. E. PATTEN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, March 19, 1861.\r\n\r\nTO MASTER GEO. EVANS PATTEN.\r\n\r\nWHOM IT MAY CONCERN:--I did see and talk with Master Geo. Evans Patten\r\nlast May at Springfield, Ill.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Written because of a denial that any interview with young Patten, then a\r\nschoolboy, had ever taken place.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO SENATE INQUIRY RE. FORT SUMTER\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:--I have received a copy of the\r\nresolution of the Senate, passed on the 25th instant, requesting me, if\r\nin my opinion not incompatible with the public interest, to communicate to\r\nthe Senate the despatches of Major Robert Anderson to the War Department\r\nduring the time he has been in command of Fort Sumter. On examination of\r\nthe correspondence thus called for, I have, with the highest respect\r\nfor the Senate, come to the conclusion that at the present moment the\r\npublication of it would be inexpedient.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MARCH 16, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF FIRST NAVAL ACTION\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 29, 1861\r\n\r\nHONORABLE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I desire that an expedition to move by sea be got ready to sail\r\nas early as the 6th of April next, the whole according to memorandum\r\nattached, and that you cooperate with the Secretary of the Navy for that\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Inclosure.]\r\n\r\nSteamers Pocahontas at Norfolk, Paunee at Washington, Harriet Lane at\r\nNew York, to be under sailing orders for sea, with stores, etc., for one\r\nmonth. Three hundred men to be kept ready for departure from on board\r\nthe receiving-ships at New York. Two hundred men to be ready to leave\r\nGovernor's Island in New York. Supplies for twelve months for one hundred\r\nmen to be put in portable shape, ready for instant shipping. A large\r\nsteamer and three tugs conditionally engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ------ STUART.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 30, 1861\r\n\r\nDEAR STUART:\r\n\r\nCousin Lizzie shows me your letter of the 27th. The question of giving her\r\nthe Springfield post-office troubles me. You see I have already appointed\r\nWilliam Jayne a Territorial governor and Judge Trumbull's brother to a\r\nland-office. Will it do for me to go on and justify the declaration that\r\nTrumbull and I have divided out all the offices among our relatives? Dr.\r\nWallace, you know, is needy, and looks to me; and I personally owe him\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nI see by the papers, a vote is to be taken as to the post-office. Could\r\nyou not set up Lizzie and beat them all? She, being here, need know\r\nnothing of it, so therefore there would be no indelicacy on her part.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDANT OF THE NEW YORK NAVY-YARD.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPT., WASHINGTON, April 1, 1861\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDANT OF THE NAVY-YARD, Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\nFit out the Powhatan to go to sea at the earnest possible moment under\r\nsealed orders. Orders by a confidential messenger go forward to-morrow.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LIEUTENANT D. D. PORTER\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, April 1, 1861\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT D. D. PORTER, United States Navy.\r\n\r\nSIR:--You will proceed to New York, and with the least possible delay,\r\nassuming command of any naval steamer available, proceed to Pensacola\r\nHarbor, and at any cost or risk prevent any expedition from the mainland\r\nreaching Fort Pickens or Santa Rosa Island.\r\n\r\nYou will exhibit this order to any naval officer at Pensacola, if you deem\r\nit necessary, after you have established yourself within the harbor, and\r\nwill request co-operation by the entrance of at least one other steamer.\r\n\r\nThis order, its object, and your destination will be communicated to no\r\nperson whatever until you reach the harbor of Pensacola.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nRecommended, WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIEF EXPEDITION FOR FORT SUMTER\r\n\r\nORDER TO OFFICERS OF THE ARMY AND NAVY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, EXECUTIVE MANSION, April 1, 1861.\r\n\r\nAll officers of the army and navy to whom this order may be exhibited\r\nwill aid by every means in their power the expedition under the command\r\nof Colonel Harvey Brown, supplying him with men and material, and\r\nco-operating with him as he may desire.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

But in taking this step the\r\nGovernment does not in the least reflect upon your efficiency or\r\npatriotism; on the contrary, have the fullest confidence in your ability\r\nto perform any duty required of you. Hoping soon to be able to give you a\r\nbetter command than the one you now enjoy, and trusting that you will have\r\nfull confidence in the disposition of the Government toward you, I remain,\r\netc.,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY SEWARD'S BID FOR POWER\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM FROM SECRETARY SEWARD, APRIL 1, 1861\r\n\r\nSome thoughts for the President's Consideration,\r\n\r\nFirst. We are at the end of a month's administration, and yet without a\r\npolicy either domestic or foreign.\r\n\r\nSecond. This, however, is not culpable, and it has even been unavoidable.\r\nThe presence of the Senate, with the need to meet applications for\r\npatronage, have prevented attention to other and more grave matters.\r\n\r\nThird. But further delay to adopt and prosecute our policies for\r\nboth domestic and foreign affairs would not only bring scandal on the\r\nadministration, but danger upon the country.\r\n\r\nFourth. To do this we must dismiss the applicants for office. But how? I\r\nsuggest that we make the local appointments forthwith, leaving foreign or\r\ngeneral ones for ulterior and occasional action.\r\n\r\nFifth. The policy at home. I am aware that my views are singular, and\r\nperhaps not sufficiently explained. My system is built upon this idea as\r\na ruling one, namely, that we must CHANGE THE QUESTION BEFORE THE PUBLIC\r\nFROM ONE UPON SLAVERY, OR ABOUT SLAVERY, for a question upon UNION OR\r\nDISUNION: In other words, from what would be regarded as a party question,\r\nto one of patriotism or union.\r\n\r\nThe occupation or evacuation of Fort Sumter, although not in fact a\r\nslavery or a party question, is so regarded. Witness the temper manifested\r\nby the Republicans in the free States, and even by the Union men in the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nI would therefore terminate it as a safe means for changing the issue. I\r\ndeem it fortunate that the last administration created the necessity.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, I would simultaneously defend and reinforce all the ports in\r\nthe gulf, and have the navy recalled from foreign stations to be prepared\r\nfor a blockade. Put the island of Key West under martial law.\r\n\r\nThis will raise distinctly the question of union or disunion. I would\r\nmaintain every fort and possession in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR FOREIGN NATIONS,\r\n\r\nI would demand explanations from Spain and France, categorically, at once.\r\n\r\nI would seek explanations from Great Britain and Russia, and send agents\r\ninto Canada, Mexico, and Central America to rouse a vigorous continental\r\nspirit of independence on this continent against European intervention.\r\n\r\nAnd, if satisfactory explanations are not received from Spain and France,\r\n\r\nWould convene Congress and declare war against them.\r\n\r\nBut whatever policy we adopt, there must be an energetic prosecution of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue and direct it\r\nincessantly.\r\n\r\nEither the President must do it himself, and be all the while active in\r\nit, or Devolve it on some member of his Cabinet. Once adopted, debates on\r\nit must end, and all agree and abide.\r\n\r\nIt is not in my especial province; But I neither seek to evade nor assume\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO SECRETARY SEWARD'S MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, APRIL 1, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Since parting with you I have been considering your\r\npaper dated this day, and entitled \"Some Thoughts for the President's\r\nConsideration.\" The first proposition in it is, \"First, We are at the end\r\nof a month's administration, and yet without a policy either domestic or\r\nforeign.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of that month, in the inaugural, I said: \"The power\r\nconfided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property\r\nand places belonging to the Government, and to Collect the duties and\r\nimposts.\" This had your distinct approval at the time; and, taken in\r\nconnection with the order I immediately gave General Scott, directing\r\nhim to employ every means in his power to strengthen and hold the\r\nforts, comprises the exact domestic policy you now urge, with the single\r\nexception that it does not propose to abandon Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nAgain, I do not perceive how the reinforcement of Fort Sumter would be\r\ndone on a slavery or a party issue, while that of Fort Pickens would be on\r\na more national and patriotic one.\r\n\r\nThe news received yesterday in regard to St. Domingo certainly brings a\r\nnew item within the range of our foreign policy; but up to that time we\r\nhave been preparing circulars and instructions to ministers and the like,\r\nall in perfect harmony, without even a suggestion that we had no foreign\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nUpon your Closing propositions--that,\r\n\r\n\"Whatever policy we adopt, there must be an energetic prosecution of it.\r\n\r\n\"For this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue and direct it\r\nincessantly.\r\n\r\n\"Either the President must do it himself, and be all the while active in\r\nit, or,\r\n\r\n\"Devolve it on some member of his Cabinet. Once adopted, debates on it\r\nmust end, and all agree and abide\"--\r\n\r\nI remark that if this must be done, I must do it. When a general line of\r\npolicy is adopted, I apprehend there is no danger of its being changed\r\nwithout good reason, or continuing to be a subject of unnecessary debate;\r\nstill, upon points arising in its progress I wish, and suppose I am\r\nentitled to have, the advice of all the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A COMMITTEE FROM THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION, APRIL 13, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM BALLARD PRESTON, ALEXANDER H. H. STUART, GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,\r\nEsq.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--As a committee of the Virginia Convention now in Session, you\r\npresent me a preamble and resolution in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, in the opinion of this Convention, the uncertainty which\r\nprevails in the public mind as to the policy which the Federal Executive\r\nintends to pursue toward the seceded States is extremely injurious to the\r\nindustrial and commercial interests of the country, tends to keep up an\r\nexcitement which is unfavorable to the adjustment of pending difficulties,\r\nand threatens a disturbance of the public peace: therefore\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, that a committee of three delegates be appointed by this\r\nConvention to wait upon the President of the United States, present to him\r\nthis preamble and resolution, and respectfully ask him to communicate to\r\nthis Convention the policy which the Federal Executive intends to pursue\r\nin regard to the Confederate States.\r\n\r\n\"Adopted by the Convention of the State of Virginia, Richmond, April 8,\r\n1861.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer I have to say that, having at the beginning of my official term\r\nexpressed my intended policy as plainly as I was able, it is with\r\ndeep regret and some mortification I now learn that there is great and\r\ninjurious uncertainty in the public mind as to what that policy is, and\r\nwhat course I intend to pursue. Not having as yet seen occasion to change,\r\nit is now my purpose to pursue the course marked out in the inaugural\r\naddress. I commend a careful consideration of the whole document as the\r\nbest expression I can give of my purposes.\r\n\r\nAs I then and therein said, I now repeat: \"The power confided to me will\r\nbe used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to\r\nthe Government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what is\r\nnecessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force\r\nagainst or among the people anywhere.\" By the words \"property and places\r\nbelonging to the Government,\" I chiefly allude to the military posts and\r\nproperty which were in the possession of the Government when it came to my\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nBut if, as now appears to be true, in pursuit of a purpose to drive the\r\nUnited States authority from these places, an unprovoked assault has been\r\nmade upon Fort Sumter, I shall hold myself at liberty to repossess, if I\r\ncan, like places which had been seized before the Government was devolved\r\nupon me. And in every event I shall, to the extent of my ability,\r\nrepel force by force. In case it proves true that Fort Sumter has been\r\nassaulted, as is reported, I shall perhaps cause the United States mails\r\nto be withdrawn from all the States which claim to have seceded, believing\r\nthat the commencement of actual war against the Government justifies and\r\npossibly demands this.\r\n\r\nI scarcely need to say that I consider the military posts and property\r\nsituated within the States which claim to have seceded as yet belonging\r\nto the Government of the United States as much as they did before the\r\nsupposed secession.\r\n\r\nWhatever else I may do for the purpose, I shall not attempt to collect the\r\nduties and imposts by any armed invasion of any part of the country; not\r\nmeaning by this, however, that I may not land a force deemed necessary to\r\nrelieve a fort upon a border of the country.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that I have quoted a part of the inaugural address, it must\r\nnot be inferred that I repudiate any other part, the whole of which I\r\nreaffirm, except so far as what I now say of the mails may be regarded as\r\na modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CALLING FOR 75,000 MILITIA,\r\n\r\nAND CONVENING CONGRESS IN EXTRA SESSION, APRIL 15, 1861.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas the laws of the United States have been for some time past and now\r\nare opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, in the States of South\r\nCarolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas,\r\nby combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of\r\njudicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals bylaw:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, A. LINCOLN, President of the United States, in virtue\r\nof the power in me vested by the Constitution and the laws, have thought\r\nfit to call forth, and hereby do call forth, the militia of the several\r\nStates of the Union, to the aggregate number of seventy-five thousand,\r\nin order to suppress said combinations, and to cause the laws to be duly\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nThe details for this object will be immediately communicated to the State\r\nauthorities through the War Department.\r\n\r\nI appeal to all loyal citizens to favor, facilitate, and aid this effort\r\nto maintain the honor, the integrity, and the existence of our National\r\nUnion, and the perpetuity of popular government; and to redress wrongs\r\nalready long enough endured.\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to say that the first service assigned to the forces\r\nhereby called forth will probably be to repossess the forts, places, and\r\nproperty which have been seized from the Union; and in every event the\r\nutmost care will be observed, consistently with the objects aforesaid, to\r\navoid any devastation, any destruction of or interference with property,\r\nor any disturbance of peaceful citizens in any part of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby command the persons composing the combinations aforesaid to\r\ndisperse and retire peacefully to their respective abodes within twenty\r\ndays from date.\r\n\r\nDeeming that the present condition of public affairs presents an\r\nextraordinary occasion, I do hereby, in virtue of the power in me vested\r\nby the Constitution, convene both Houses of Congress. Senators and\r\nRepresentatives are therefore summoned to assemble at their respective\r\nchambers, at twelve o'clock noon, on Thursday, the fourth day of July\r\nnext, then and there to consider and determine such measures as, in their\r\nwisdom, the public safety and interest may seem to demand.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this fifteenth day of April, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF BLOCKADE, APRIL 19, 1861\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas an insurrection against the Government of the United States has\r\nbroken out in the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and the laws of the United States\r\nfor the collection of the revenue cannot be effectually executed therein\r\nconformably to that provision of the Constitution which requires duties to\r\nbe uniform throughout the United States:\r\n\r\nAnd Whereas a combination of persons engaged in such insurrection have\r\nthreatened to grant pretended letters of marque to authorize the bearers\r\nthereof to commit assaults on the lives, vessels, and property of good\r\ncitizens of the country lawfully engaged in commerce on the high seas, and\r\nin waters of the United States:\r\n\r\nAnd Whereas an executive proclamation has been already issued requiring\r\nthe persons engaged in these disorderly proceedings to desist therefrom,\r\ncalling out a militia force for the purpose of repressing the same, and\r\nconvening Congress in extraordinary session to deliberate and determine\r\nthereon:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham LINCOLN, President of the United States, with\r\na view to the same purposes before mentioned, and to the protection of\r\nthe public peace, and the lives and property of quiet and orderly citizens\r\npursuing their lawful occupations, until Congress shall have assembled and\r\ndeliberated on the said unlawful proceedings, or until the same shall have\r\nceased, have further deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade of the\r\nports within the States aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws of the United\r\nStates, and of the law of nations in such case provided. For this purpose\r\na competent force will be posted so as to prevent entrance and exit of\r\nvessels from the ports aforesaid. If, therefore, with a view to violate\r\nsuch blockade, a vessel shall approach or shall attempt to leave either\r\nof the said ports, she will be duly warned by the commander of one of the\r\nblockading vessels, who will indorse on her register the fact and date of\r\nsuch warning, and if the same vessel shall again attempt to enter or\r\nleave the blockaded port, she will be captured and sent to the nearest\r\nconvenient port, for such proceedings against her and her cargo, as prize,\r\nas may be deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby proclaim and declare that if any person, under the pretended\r\nauthority of the said States, or under any other pretense, shall molest a\r\nvessel of the United States, or the persons or cargo on board of her,\r\nsuch person will be held amenable to the laws of the United States for the\r\nprevention and punishment of piracy.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of April, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR HICKS AND MAYOR BROWN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 20, 1861\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR HICKS AND MAYOR BROWN.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter by Messrs. Bond, Dobbin, and Brune is received.\r\nI tender you both my sincere thanks for your efforts to keep the peace in\r\nthe trying situation in which you are placed.\r\n\r\nFor the future troops must be brought here, but I make no point of\r\nbringing them through Baltimore. Without any military knowledge myself, of\r\ncourse I must leave details to General Scott. He hastily said this morning\r\nin the presence of these gentlemen, \"March them around Baltimore, and\r\nnot through it.\" I sincerely hope the General, on fuller reflection, will\r\nconsider this practical and proper, and that you will not object to it.\r\nBy this a collision of the people of Baltimore with the troops will be\r\navoided, unless they go out of their way to seek it. I hope you will exert\r\nyour influence to prevent this.\r\n\r\nNow and ever I shall do all in my power for peace consistently with the\r\nmaintenance of the Government.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR HICKS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 20, 1861\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR HICKS:\r\n\r\nI desire to consult with you and the Mayor of Baltimore relative to\r\npreserving the peace of Maryland. Please come immediately by special\r\ntrain, which you can take at Baltimore; or, if necessary, one can be sent\r\nfrom here. Answer forthwith.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER TO DEFEND FROM A MARYLAND INSURRECTION\r\n\r\nORDER TO GENERAL SCOTT. WASHINGTON, April 25, 1861\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL SCOTT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--The Maryland Legislature assembles to-morrow at Annapolis,\r\nand not improbably will take action to arm the people of that State\r\nagainst the United States. The question has been submitted to and\r\nconsidered by me whether it would not be justifiable, upon the ground of\r\nnecessary defense, for you, as General in Chief of the United States Army,\r\nto arrest or disperse the members of that body. I think it would not be\r\njustifiable nor efficient for the desired object.\r\n\r\nFirst. They have a clearly legal right to assemble, and we cannot know in\r\nadvance that their action will not be lawful and peaceful, and if we wait\r\nuntil they shall have acted their arrest or dispersion will not lessen the\r\neffect of their action.\r\n\r\nSecondly. We cannot permanently prevent their action. If we arrest them,\r\nwe cannot long hold them as prisoners, and when liberated they will\r\nimmediately reassemble and take their action; and precisely the same if\r\nwe simply disperse them--they will immediately reassemble in some other\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nI therefore conclude that it is only left to the Commanding General to\r\nwatch and await their action, which, if it shall be to arm their people\r\nagainst the United States, he is to adopt the most prompt and efficient\r\nmeans to counteract, even, if necessary, to the bombardment of their\r\ncities and, in the extremist necessity, the suspension of the writ of\r\nhabeas corpus.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF BLOCKADE, APRIL 27, 1861\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, for the reasons assigned in my proclamation of the nineteenth\r\ninstant, a blockade of the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia,\r\nFlorida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas was ordered to be\r\nestablished:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, since that date, public property of the United States\r\nhas been seized, the collection of the revenue obstructed, and duly\r\ncommissioned officers of the United States, while engaged in executing\r\nthe orders of their superiors, have been arrested and held in custody as\r\nprisoners, or have been impeded in the discharge of their official duties,\r\nwithout due legal process, by persons claiming to act under authorities of\r\nthe States of Virginia and North Carolina:\r\n\r\nAn efficient blockade of the ports of those States will also be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this twenty seventh day of April, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS TO A MILITARY COMPANY, WASHINGTON, APRIL 27, 1861\r\n\r\nI have desired as sincerely as any man, and I sometimes think more than\r\nany other man, that our present difficulties might be settled without the\r\nshedding of blood. I will not say that all hope has yet gone; but if the\r\nalternative is presented whether the Union is to be broken in fragments\r\nand the liberties of the people lost, or blood be shed, you will probably\r\nmake the choice with which I shall not be dissatisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCALIZED REPEAL OF WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SCOTT.\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDING GENERAL, ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nYou are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against the laws of the\r\nUnited States. If at any point on or in the vicinity of any military line\r\nwhich is now or which shall be used between the City of Philadelphia and\r\nthe city of Washington you find resistance which renders it necessary to\r\nsuspend the writ of habeas corpus for the public safety, you personally,\r\nor through the officer in command at the point at which resistance occurs,\r\nare authorized to suspend that writ.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 17, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY ENROLLMENT OF ST. LOUIS CITIZENS\r\n\r\nFROM THE SECRETARY OF WAR WAR DEPARTMENT, April 30, 1861\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN NATHANIEL LYON.\r\n\r\nCAPT. NATHANIEL LYON, Commanding Department of the West.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The President of the United States directs that you enroll in the\r\nmilitary service of the United States the loyal citizens of Saint Louis\r\nand vicinity, not exceeding, with those heretofore enlisted, ten thousand\r\nin number, for the purpose of maintaining the authority of the United\r\nStates; for the protection of the peaceful inhabitants of Missouri; and\r\nyou will, if deemed necessary for that purpose by yourself, by Messrs.\r\nOliver F. Ferny, John How, James O. Broadhead, Samuel T. Glover, J.\r\nWilzie, Francis P. Blair, Jr., proclaim martial law in the city of Saint\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\nThe additional force hereby authorized shall be discharged in part or in\r\nwhole, if enlisted. As soon as it appears to you and the gentlemen above\r\nmentioned that there is no danger of an attempt on the part of the enemies\r\nof the Government to take military possession of the city of Saint Louis,\r\nor put the city in control of the combination against the Government of\r\nthe United States; and whilst such additional force remains in the service\r\nthe same shall be governed by the Rules and Articles of War, and such\r\nspecial regulations as you may prescribe. I shall like the force hereafter\r\ndirected to be enrolled to be under your command.\r\n\r\nThe arms and other military stores in the Saint Louis Arsenal not needed\r\nfor the forces of the United States in Missouri must be removed to\r\nSpringfield, or some other safe place of deposit in the State of Illinois,\r\nas speedily as practicable, by the ordnance officers in charge at Saint\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\n(Indorsement.)\r\n\r\nIt is revolutionary times, and therefore I do not object to the\r\nirregularity of this. W. S.\r\n\r\nApproved, April 30, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nColonel Thomas will make this order.  SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDOLENCE OVER FAILURE OF FT. SUMTER RELIEF\r\n\r\nTO GUSTAVUS V. FOX.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., May 1, 1861\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN G. V. Fox.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I sincerely regret that the failure of the late attempt to\r\nprovision Fort Sumter should be the source of any annoyance to you.\r\n\r\nThe practicability of your plan was not, in fact, brought to a test. By\r\nreason of a gale, well known in advance to be possible and not improbable,\r\nthe tugs, an essential part of the plan, never reached the ground; while,\r\nby an accident for which you were in no wise responsible, and possibly I\r\nto some extent was, you were deprived of a war vessel, with her men, which\r\nyou deemed of great importance to the enterprise.\r\n\r\nI most cheerfully and truly declare that the failure of the undertaking\r\nhas not lowered you a particle, while the qualities you developed in the\r\neffort have greatly heightened you in my estimation.\r\n\r\nFor a daring and dangerous enterprise of a similar character you would\r\nto-day be the man of all my acquaintances whom I would select. You and I\r\nboth anticipated that the cause of the country would be advanced by making\r\nthe attempt to provision Fort Sumter, even if it should fail; and it is\r\nno small consolation now to feel that our anticipation is justified by the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nVery truly your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CALLING FOR 42,034 VOLUNTEERS,\r\n\r\nMAY 3, 1861\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA Proclamation..\r\n\r\nWhereas existing exigencies demand immediate and adequate measures for\r\nthe protection of the National Constitution and the preservation of the\r\nNational Union by the suppression of the insurrectionary combinations\r\nnow existing in several States for opposing the laws of the Union and\r\nobstructing the execution thereof, to which end a military force in\r\naddition to that called forth by my proclamation of the 15th day of April\r\nin the present year appears to be indispensably necessary:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States and\r\nCommander in Chief of the Army and Navy thereof and of the militia of the\r\nseveral States when called into actual service, do hereby call into the\r\nservice of the United States 42,034 volunteers to serve for the period of\r\nthree years, unless sooner discharged, and to be mustered into service\r\nas infantry and cavalry. The proportions of each arm and the details of\r\nenrollment and organization will be made known through the Department of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nAnd I also direct that the Regular Army of the United States be increased\r\nby the addition of eight regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry,\r\nand one regiment of artillery, making altogether a maximum aggregate\r\nincrease of 22,714 officers and enlisted men, the details of which\r\nincrease will also be made known through the Department of War.\r\n\r\nAnd I further direct the enlistment for not less than one or more than\r\nthree years of 18,000 seamen, in addition to the present force, for the\r\nnaval service of the United States. The details of the enlistment and\r\norganization will be made known through the Department of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe call for volunteers hereby made and the direction for the increase of\r\nthe Regular Army and for the enlistment of seamen hereby given, together\r\nwith the plan of organization adopted for the volunteer and for the\r\nregular forces hereby authorized, will be submitted to Congress as soon as\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I earnestly invoke the co-operation of all good citizens\r\nin the measures hereby adopted for the effectual suppression of unlawful\r\nviolence, for the impartial enforcement of constitutional laws, and for\r\nthe speediest possible restoration of peace and order, and with these of\r\nhappiness and prosperity, throughout our country.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my band and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed................\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION WITH VICE-PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nTO VICE-PRESIDENT HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., May 6, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. H. HAMLIN, New York.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:-Please advise me at the close of each day what troops left\r\nduring the day, where going, and by what route; what remaining at New\r\nYork, and what expected in the next day. Give the numbers, as near as\r\nconvenient, and what corps they are. This information, reaching us daily,\r\nwill be very useful as well as satisfactory.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER TO COLONEL ANDERSON,\r\n\r\nMAY 7, 1861\r\n\r\nTO ALL WHO SHALL SEE THESE PRESENTS, GREETING:\r\n\r\nKnow ye that, reposing special trust and confidence in the patriotism,\r\nvalor, fidelity, and ability of Colonel Robert Anderson, U. S. Army, I\r\nhave empowered him, and do hereby empower him, to receive into the army of\r\nthe United States as many regiments of volunteer troops from the State of\r\nKentucky and from the western part of the State of Virginia as shall be\r\nwilling to engage in the Service of the United States for the term of\r\nthree years, upon the terms and according to the plan proposed by the\r\nproclamation of May 3, 1861, and General Orders No. 15, from the War\r\nDepartment, of May 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe troops whom he receives shall be on the same footing in every respect\r\nas those of the like kind called for in the proclamation above cited,\r\nexcept that the officers shall be commissioned by the United States. He is\r\ntherefore carefully and diligently to discharge the duty hereby devolved\r\nupon him by doing and performing all manner of things thereunto belonging.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 7th day of May, A.\r\nD. 1861, and in the eighty-fifth year of the independence of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Porter was placed in command of the steamer Powhatan,\r\nand Captain Samuel Mercer was detached therefrom, by my special order, and\r\nneither of them is responsible for any apparent or real irregularity on\r\ntheir part or in connection with that vessel.\r\n\r\nHereafter Captain Porter is relieved from that special service and placed\r\nunder the direction of the Navy Department, from which he will receive\r\ninstructions and to which he will report.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN'S CORRECTIONS OF A DIPLOMATIC DESPATCH\r\n\r\nWRITTEN BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO MINISTER ADAMS\r\n\r\nNO. 10.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE. WASHINGTON, May 21, 1861\r\n\r\nSIR:---Mr. Dallas, in a brief despatch of May 2d (No. 333), tells us that\r\nLord John Russell recently requested an interview with him on account of\r\nthe solicitude which his lordship felt concerning the effect of certain\r\nmeasures represented as likely to be adopted by the President. In\r\nthat conversation the British secretary told Mr. Dallas that the three\r\nrepresentatives of the Southern Confederacy were then in London, that Lord\r\nJohn Russell had not yet seen them, but that he was not unwilling to see\r\nthem unofficially. He further informed Mr. Dallas that an understanding\r\nexists between the British and French governments which would lead both to\r\ntake one and the same course as to recognition. His lordship then referred\r\nto the rumor of a meditated blockade by us of Southern ports, and a\r\ndiscontinuance of them as ports of entry. Mr. Dallas answered that he knew\r\nnothing on those topics, and therefore\r\n\r\n   (The President's corrections, both in notes and text, are in\r\n   caps. All matter between brackets was to be marked out.)\r\n\r\ncould say nothing. He added that you were expected to arrive in two weeks.\r\nUpon this statement Lord John Russell acquiesced in the expediency of\r\nwaiting for the full knowledge you were expected to bring.\r\n\r\nMr. Dallas transmitted to us some newspaper reports of ministerial\r\nexplanations made in Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou will base no proceedings on parliamentary debates further than to seek\r\nexplanations when necessary and communicate them to this department.\r\n[We intend to have a clear and simple record of whatever issue may arise\r\nbetween us and Great Britain.]\r\n\r\nThe President [is surprised and grieved] regrets that Mr. Dallas did not\r\nprotest against the proposed unofficial intercourse between the British\r\nGovernment and the missionaries of the insurgents [as well as against\r\nthe demand for explanations made by the British Government]. It is due,\r\nhowever, to Mr. Dallas to say that our instructions had been given only to\r\nyou and not to him, and that his loyalty and fidelity, too rare in these\r\ntimes [among our late representatives abroad, are confessed and] are\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nIntercourse of any kind with the so-called commissioners is liable to be\r\nconstrued as a recognition of the authority which appointed them. Such\r\nintercourse would be none the less [wrongful] hurtful to us for being\r\ncalled unofficial, and it might be even more injurious, because we should\r\nhave no means of knowing what points might be resolved by it. Moreover,\r\nunofficial intercourse is useless and meaningless if it is not expected\r\nto ripen into official intercourse and direct recognition. It is left\r\ndoubtful here whether the proposed unofficial intercourse has yet actually\r\nbegun. Your own [present] antecedent instructions are deemed explicit\r\nenough, and it is hoped that you have not misunderstood them. You will\r\nin any event desist from all intercourse whatever, unofficial as well\r\nas official, with the British Government, so long as it shall continue\r\nintercourse of either kind with the domestic enemies of this country\r\n[confining yourself to a delivery of a copy of this paper to the Secretary\r\nof State. After doing this.] When intercourse shall have been arrested for\r\nthis cause, you will communicate with this department and receive further\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell has informed us of an understanding between the British\r\nand French governments that they will act together in regard to our\r\naffairs. This communication, however, loses something of its value from\r\nthe circumstance that the communication was withheld until after knowledge\r\nof the fact had been acquired by us from other sources. We know also\r\nanother fact that has not yet been officially communicated to us--namely,\r\nthat other European States are apprised by France and England of their\r\nagreement, and are expected to concur with or follow them in whatever\r\nmeasures they adopt on the subject of recognition. The United States have\r\nbeen impartial and just in all their conduct toward the several nations of\r\nEurope. They will not complain, however, of the combination now announced\r\nby the two leading powers, although they think they had a right to expect\r\na more independent, if not a more friendly, course from each of them. You\r\nwill take no notice of that or any other alliance. Whenever the European\r\ngovernments shall see fit to communicate directly with us, we shall be, as\r\nheretofore, frank and explicit in our reply.\r\n\r\nAs to the blockade, you will say that by [the] our own laws [of nature]\r\nand the laws of nature and the laws of nations, this Government has\r\na clear right to suppress insurrection. An exclusion of commerce from\r\nnational ports which have been seized by the insurgents, in the equitable\r\nform of blockade, is the proper means to that end. You will [admit] not\r\ninsist that our blockade is [not] to be respected if it be not maintained\r\nby a competent force; but passing by that question as not now a practical,\r\nor at least an urgent, one, you will add that [it] the blockade is now,\r\nand it will continue to be so maintained, and therefore we expect it to be\r\nrespected by Great Britain. You will add that we have already revoked the\r\nexequatur of a Russian consul who had enlisted in the military service of\r\nthe insurgents, and we shall dismiss or demand the recall of every foreign\r\nagent, consular or diplomatic, who shall either disobey the Federal laws\r\nor disown the Federal authority.\r\n\r\nAs to the recognition of the so-called Southern Confederacy, it is not\r\nto be made a subject of technical definition. It is, of course, [quasi]\r\ndirect recognition to publish an acknowledgment of the sovereignty and\r\nindependence of a new power. It is [quasi] direct recognition to receive\r\nits ambassadors, ministers, agents, or commissioners officially.\r\nA concession of belligerent rights is liable to be construed as a\r\nrecognition of them. No one of these proceedings will [be borne] pass\r\n[unnoticed] unquestioned by the United States in this case.\r\n\r\nHitherto recognition has been moved only on the assumption that the\r\nso-called Confederate States are de facto a self-sustaining power. Now,\r\nafter long forbearance, designed to soothe discontent and avert the need\r\nof civil war, the land and naval forces of the United States have been put\r\nin motion to repress the insurrection. The true character of the pretended\r\nnew State is at once revealed. It is seen to be a power existing in\r\npronunciamento only, It has never won a field. It has obtained no forts\r\nthat were not virtually betrayed into its hands or seized in breach of\r\ntrust. It commands not a single port on the coast nor any highway out from\r\nits pretended capital by land. Under these circumstances Great Britain is\r\ncalled upon to intervene and give it body and independence by resisting\r\nour measures of suppression. British recognition would be British\r\nintervention to create within our own territory a hostile state by\r\noverthrowing this republic itself. [When this act of intervention is\r\ndistinctly performed, we from that hour shall cease to be friends, and\r\nbecome once more, as we have twice before been forced to be, enemies of\r\nGreat Britain.]\r\n\r\nAs to the treatment of privateers in the insurgent service, you will say\r\nthat this is a question exclusively our own. We treat them as pirates.\r\nThey are our own citizens, or persons employed by our citizens, preying\r\non the commerce of our country. If Great Britain shall choose to recognize\r\nthem as lawful belligerents, and give them shelter from our pursuit and\r\npunishment, the laws of nations afford an adequate and proper remedy\r\n[and we shall avail ourselves of it. And while you need not say this in\r\nadvance, be sure that you say nothing inconsistent with it.]\r\n\r\nHappily, however, her Britannic Majesty's government can avoid all these\r\ndifficulties. It invited us in 1856 to accede to the declaration of the\r\nCongress of Paris, of which body Great Britain was herself a member,\r\nabolishing privateering everywhere in all cases and forever. You already\r\nhave our authority to propose to her our accession to that declaration. If\r\nshe refuse to receive it, it can only be because she is willing to become\r\nthe patron of privateering when aimed at our devastation.\r\n\r\nThese positions are not elaborately defended now, because to vindicate\r\nthem would imply a possibility of our waiving them.\r\n\r\n1 We are not insensible of the grave importance of\r\n\r\n1 (Drop all from this line to the end, and in lieu of it write, \"This\r\npaper is for your own guidance only, and not [sic] to be read or shown to\r\nany one.\")\r\n\r\n(Secretary Seward, when the despatch was returned to him, added\r\nan introductory paragraph stating that the document was strictly\r\nconfidential. For this reason these last two paragraphs remained as they\r\nare here printed.)\r\n\r\nthis occasion. We see how, upon the result of the debate in which we are\r\nengaged, a war may ensue between the United States and one, two, or even\r\nmore European nations. War in any case is as exceptionable from the habits\r\nas it is revolting from the sentiments of the American people. But if\r\nit come, it will be fully seen that it results from the action of Great\r\nBritain, not our own; that Great Britain will have decided to fraternize\r\nwith our domestic enemy, either without waiting to hear from you our\r\nremonstrances and our warnings, or after having heard them. War in defense\r\nof national life is not immoral, and war in defense of independence is an\r\ninevitable part of the discipline of nations.\r\n\r\nThe dispute will be between the European and the American branches of the\r\nBritish race. All who belong to that race will especially deprecate it,\r\nas they ought. It may well be believed that men of every race and kindred\r\nwill deplore it. A war not unlike it between the same parties occurred at\r\nthe close of the last century. Europe atoned by forty years of suffering\r\nfor the error that Great Britain committed in provoking that contest. If\r\nthat nation shall now repeat the same great error, the social convulsions\r\nwhich will follow may not be so long, but they will be more general. When\r\nthey shall have ceased, it will, we think, be seen, whatever may have been\r\nthe fortunes of other nations, that it is not the United States that\r\nwill have come out of them with its precious Constitution altered or its\r\nhonestly obtained dominion in any degree abridged. Great Britain has but\r\nto wait a few months and all her present inconveniences will cease with\r\nall our own troubles. If she take a different course, she will calculate\r\nfor herself the ultimate as well as the immediate consequences, and will\r\nconsider what position she will hold when she shall have forever lost the\r\nsympathies and the affections of the only nation on whose sympathies and\r\naffections she has a natural claim. In making that calculation she will do\r\nwell to remember that in the controversy she proposes to open we shall be\r\nactuated by neither pride, nor passion, nor cupidity, nor ambition; but\r\nwe shall stand simply on the principle of self-preservation, and that our\r\ncause will involve the independence of nations and the rights of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, respectfully your obedient servant, W. H. S.\r\n\r\nCHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS, Esq., etc,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, May 21, 1861.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR. MY DEAR SIR:--Why cannot Colonel Small's\r\nPhiladelphia regiment be received? I sincerely wish it could. There is\r\nsomething strange about it. Give these gentlemen an interview, and take\r\ntheir regiment.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MORGAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 12, 1861\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR E. D. MORGAN, Albany, N.Y.\r\n\r\nI wish to see you face to face to clear these difficulties about\r\nforwarding troops from New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN DAHLGREEN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE, MANSION, May 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nCAPT. DAHLGREEN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Allow me to introduce Col. J. A. McLernand, M.C. of my own\r\ndistrict in Illinois. If he should desire to visit Fortress Monroe, please\r\nintroduce him to the captain of one of the vessels in our service, and\r\npass him down and back.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF CONDOLENCE TO ONE OF FIRST CASUALTIES\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL ELLSWORTH'S PARENTS, WASHINGTON, D.C., May 25, 1861\r\n\r\nTO THE FATHER AND MOTHER OF COL. ELMER E. ELLSWORTH.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR AND MADAME:--In the untimely loss of your noble son, our\r\naffliction here is scarcely less than your own. So much of promised\r\nusefulness to one's country, and of bright hopes for one's self and\r\nfriends, have never been so suddenly dashed as in his fall. In size, in\r\nyears, and in youthful appearance a boy only, his power to command men\r\nwas surpassingly great. This power, combined with a fine intellectual and\r\nindomitable energy, and a taste altogether military, constituted in him,\r\nas seemed to me, the best natural talent in that department I ever knew.\r\nAnd yet he was singularly modest and deferential in social intercourse.\r\nMy acquaintance with him began less than two years ago; yet, through the\r\nlatter half of the intervening period, it was as intense as the disparity\r\nof our ages and my engrossing engagements would permit. To me he appeared\r\nto have no indulgences or pastimes, and I never heard him utter a profane\r\nor an intemperate word. What was conclusive of his good heart, he never\r\nforgot his parents. The honors he labored for so laudably, and for which,\r\nin the sad end, he so gallantly gave his life, he meant for them no less\r\nthan for himself.\r\n\r\nIn the hope that it may be no intrusion upon the sacredness of your\r\nsorrow, I have ventured to address you this tribute to the memory of my\r\nyoung friend and your brave and early fallen son.\r\n\r\nMay God give you the consolation which is beyond all early power.\r\n\r\nSincerely your friend in common affliction,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BARTLETT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 27, 1861\r\n\r\nCOL. W. A. BARTLETT, New York.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Brigade was to go to Fort Monroe without trouble to the\r\ngovernment, and must so go or not at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM ABOUT INDIANA REGIMENTS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JUNE 11, 1861\r\n\r\n The government has already accepted ten regiments from the State of\r\nIndiana. I think at least six more ought to be received from that State,\r\ntwo to be those of Colonel James W. McMillan and Colonel William L.\r\nBrown, and the other four to be designated by the Governor of the State\r\nof Indiana, and to be received into the volunteer service of the United\r\nStates according to the \"Plan of Organization\" in the General Orders of\r\nthe War Department, No.15. When they report to Major-General McClellan in\r\ncondition to pass muster according to that order, and with the approval of\r\nthe Secretary of War to be indorsed hereon, and left in his department,\r\nI direct that the whole six, or any smaller number of such regiments, be\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, JUNE 13, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--There is, it seems, a regiment in Massachusetts commanded\r\nby Fletcher Webster, and which HON. Daniel Webster's old friends very much\r\nwish to get into the service. If it can be received with the approval of\r\nyour department and the consent of the Governor of Massachusetts I shall\r\nindeed be much gratified. Give Mr. Ashmun a chance to explain fully.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, JUNE 13, 1861 HON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--I think it is entirely safe to accept a fifth regiment from\r\nMichigan, and with your approbation I should say a regiment presented by\r\nCol. T. B. W. Stockton, ready for service within two weeks from now, will\r\nbe received. Look at Colonel Stockton's testimonials.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, June 17, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY Of WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--With your concurrence, and that of the Governor of Indiana,\r\nI am in favor of accepting into what we call the three years' service any\r\nnumber not exceeding four additional regiments from that State. Probably\r\nthey should come from the triangular region between the Ohio and Wabash\r\nRivers, including my own old boyhood home. Please see HON. C. M. Allen,\r\nSpeaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, and unless you perceive\r\ngood reason to the contrary, draw up an order for him according to the\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, JUNE 17,1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR. MY DEAR SIR:--With your concurrence, and that of\r\nthe Governor of Ohio, I am in favor of receiving into what we call the\r\nthree years' service any number not exceeding six additional regiments\r\nfrom that State, unless you perceive good reasons to the contrary. Please\r\nsee HON. John A. Gurley, who bears this, and make an order corresponding\r\nwith the above.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO N. W. EDWARDS\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., June 19, 1861\r\n\r\nHon. N. W. EDWARDS MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n....When you wrote me some time ago in reference to looking up something\r\nin the departments here, I thought I would inquire into the thing and\r\nwrite you, but the extraordinary pressure upon me diverted me from it, and\r\nsoon it passed out of my mind. The thing you proposed, it seemed to me, I\r\nought to understand myself before it was set on foot by my direction or\r\npermission; and I really had no time to make myself acquainted with it.\r\nNor have I yet. And yet I am unwilling, of course, that you should be\r\ndeprived of a chance to make something, if it can be done without\r\ninjustice to the Government, or to any individual. If you choose to come\r\nhere and point out to me how this can be done I shall not only not object,\r\nbut shall be gratified to be able to oblige you.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CAMERON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, June 20, 1861.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Since you spoke to me yesterday about General J. H. Lane, of\r\nKansas, I have been reflecting upon the subject, and have concluded that\r\nwe need the service of such a man out there at once; that we had better\r\nappoint him a brigadier-general of volunteers to-day, and send him off\r\nwith such authority to raise a force (I think two regiments better than\r\nthree, but as to this I am not particular) as you think will get him into\r\nactual work quickest. Tell him, when he starts, to put it through not to\r\nbe writing or telegraphing back here, but put it through.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Lane has been authorized to raise two additional regiments of\r\nvolunteers.\r\n\r\nSIMON CAMERON, Secretary o f War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE KENTUCKY DELEGATION.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, June 29, 1861.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE KENTUCKY DELEGATION WHO ARE FOR THE UNION:\r\n\r\nI somewhat wish to authorize my friend Jesse Bayles to raise a Kentucky\r\nregiment, but I do not wish to do it without your consent. If you consent,\r\nplease write so at the bottom of this.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n   We consent:\r\n   R. MALLORY.\r\n   H. GRIDER.\r\n   G. W. DUNLAP.\r\n   J. S. JACKSON.\r\n   C. A. WICKLIFFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 5, 1861.\r\n\r\nI repeat, I would like for Col. Bayles to raise a regiment of cavalry\r\nwhenever the Union men of Kentucky desire or consent to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER AUTHORIZING GENERAL SCOTT TO SUSPEND THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS, JULY\r\n2, 1861\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDING GENERAL, ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nYou are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against the laws of the\r\nUnited States. If at any point on or in the vicinity of any military line\r\nwhich is now or which shall be used between the city of New York and\r\nthe city of Washington you find resistance which renders it necessary to\r\nsuspend the writ of habeas corpus for the public safety, you personally,\r\nor through the officer in command at the point where resistance occurs,\r\nare authorized to suspend that writ.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States at the city of\r\nWashington, this second day of July, A.D. 1861, and of the independence of\r\nthe United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, JULY 3, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--General Scott had sent me a copy of the despatch of which\r\nyou kindly sent one. Thanks to both him and you. Please assemble the\r\nCabinet at twelve to-day to look over the message and reports.\r\n\r\nAnd now, suppose you step over at once and let us see General Scott (and)\r\nGeneral Cameron about assigning a position to General Fremont.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS IN SPECIAL SESSION,\r\n\r\nJULY 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:--Having been\r\nconvened on an extraordinary occasion, as authorized by the Constitution,\r\nyour attention is not called to any ordinary subject of legislation.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present Presidential term, four months ago, the\r\nfunctions of the Federal Government were found to be generally\r\nsuspended within the several States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Florida, excepting only those of the\r\nPost-Office Department.\r\n\r\nWithin these States all the forts, arsenals, dockyards, custom-houses, and\r\nthe like, including the movable and stationary property in and about\r\nthem, had been seized, and were held in open hostility to this government,\r\nexcepting only Forts Pickens, Taylor, and Jefferson, on and near the\r\nFlorida coast, and Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. The\r\nforts thus seized had been put in improved condition, new ones had been\r\nbuilt, and armed forces had been organized and were organizing, all\r\navowedly with the same hostile purpose.\r\n\r\nThe forts remaining in the possession of the Federal Government in and\r\nnear these States were either besieged or menaced by warlike preparations,\r\nand especially Fort Sumter was nearly surrounded by well-protected\r\nhostile batteries, with guns equal in quality to the best of its own, and\r\noutnumbering the latter as perhaps ten to one. A disproportionate share\r\nof the Federal muskets and rifles had somehow found their way into\r\nthese States, and had been seized to be used against the government.\r\nAccumulations of the public revenue lying within them had been seized for\r\nthe same object. The navy was scattered in distant seas, leaving but\r\na very small part of it within the immediate reach of the government.\r\nOfficers of the Federal army and navy had resigned in great numbers;\r\nand of those resigning a large proportion had taken up arms against the\r\ngovernment. Simultaneously, and in connection with all this, the purpose\r\nto sever the Federal Union was openly avowed. In accordance with this\r\npurpose, an ordinance had been adopted in each of these States, declaring\r\nthe States respectively to be separated from the national Union. A\r\nformula for instituting a combined government of these States had\r\nbeen promulgated; and this illegal organization, in the character\r\nof confederate States, was already invoking recognition, aid, and\r\nintervention from foreign powers.\r\n\r\nFinding this condition of things, and believing it to be an imperative\r\nduty upon the incoming executive to prevent, if possible, the consummation\r\nof such attempt to destroy the Federal Union, a choice of means to that\r\nend became indispensable. This choice was made and was declared in the\r\ninaugural address. The policy chosen looked to the exhaustion of all\r\npeaceful measures before a resort to any stronger ones. It sought only\r\nto hold the public places and property not already wrested from the\r\ngovernment, and to collect the revenue, relying for the rest on time,\r\ndiscussion, and the ballot-box. It promised a continuance of the mails, at\r\ngovernment expense, to the very people who were resisting the government;\r\nand it gave repeated pledges against any disturbance to any of the\r\npeople, or any of their rights. Of all that which a President might\r\nconstitutionally and justifiably do in such a case, everything was\r\nforborne without which it was believed possible to keep the government on\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of March (the present incumbent's first full day in office), a\r\nletter of Major Anderson, commanding at Fort Sumter, written on the 28th\r\nof February and received at the War Department on the 4th of March, was\r\nby that department placed in his hands. This letter expressed the\r\nprofessional opinion of the writer that reinforcements could not be thrown\r\ninto that fort within the time for his relief, rendered necessary by the\r\nlimited supply of provisions, and with a view of holding possession of the\r\nsame, with a force of less than twenty thousand good and well-disciplined\r\nmen. This opinion was concurred in by all the officers of his command, and\r\ntheir memoranda on the subject were made inclosures of Major Anderson's\r\nletter. The whole was immediately laid before Lieutenant-General Scott,\r\nwho at once concurred with Major Anderson in opinion. On reflection,\r\nhowever, he took full time, consulting with other officers, both of\r\nthe army and the navy, and at the end of four days came reluctantly but\r\ndecidedly to the same conclusion as before. He also stated at the\r\nsame time that no such sufficient force was then at the control of the\r\ngovernment, or could be raised and brought to the ground within the time\r\nwhen the provisions in the fort would be exhausted. In a purely military\r\npoint of view, this reduced the duty of the administration in the case to\r\nthe mere matter of getting the garrison safely out of the fort.\r\n\r\nIt was believed, however, that to so abandon that position, under the\r\ncircumstances, would be utterly ruinous; that the necessity under which\r\nit was to be done would not be fully understood; that by many it would\r\nbe construed as a part of a voluntary policy; that at home it would\r\ndiscourage the friends of the Union, embolden its adversaries, and go far\r\nto insure to the latter a recognition abroad; that in fact, it would\r\nbe our national destruction consummated. This could not be allowed.\r\nStarvation was not yet upon the garrison, and ere it would be reached\r\nFort Pickens might be reinforced. This last would be a clear indication\r\nof policy, and would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of\r\nFort Sumter as a military necessity. An order was at once directed to be\r\nsent for the landing of the troops from the steamship Brooklyn into Fort\r\nPickens. This order could not go by land, but must take the longer and\r\nslower route by sea. The first return news from the order was received\r\njust one week before the fall of Fort Sumter. The news itself was that\r\nthe officer commanding the Sabine, to which vessel the troops had been\r\ntransferred from the Brooklyn, acting upon some quasi armistice of\r\nthe late administration (and of the existence of which the present\r\nadministration, up to the time the order was despatched, had only too\r\nvague and uncertain rumors to fix attention), had refused to land the\r\ntroops. To now reinforce Fort Pickens before a crisis would be reached\r\nat Fort Sumter was impossible--rendered so by the near exhaustion\r\nof provisions in the latter-named fort. In precaution against such a\r\nconjuncture, the government had, a few days before, commenced preparing\r\nan expedition as well adapted as might be to relieve Fort Sumter, which\r\nexpedition was intended to be ultimately used, or not, according to\r\ncircumstances. The strongest anticipated case for using it was now\r\npresented, and it was resolved to send it forward. As had been intended\r\nin this contingency, it was also resolved to notify the governor of South\r\nCarolina that he might expect an attempt would be made to provision the\r\nfort; and that, if the attempt should not be resisted, there would be no\r\neffort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition, without further notice, or\r\nin case of an attack upon the fort. This notice was accordingly given;\r\nwhereupon the fort was attacked and bombarded to its fall, without even\r\nawaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of Fort Sumter was in\r\nno sense a matter of self-defense on the part of the assailants. They\r\nwell knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit\r\naggression upon them. They knew--they were expressly notified--that the\r\ngiving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was all\r\nwhich would on that occasion be attempted, unless themselves, by resisting\r\nso much, should provoke more. They knew that this government desired to\r\nkeep the garrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to maintain\r\nvisible possession, and thus to preserve the Union from actual and\r\nimmediate dissolution--trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to time,\r\ndiscussion, and the ballot-box for final adjustment; and they assailed\r\nand reduced the fort for precisely the reverse object--to drive out the\r\nvisible authority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to immediate\r\ndissolution. That this was their object the executive well understood; and\r\nhaving said to them in the inaugural address, \"You can have no conflict\r\nwithout being yourselves the aggressors,\" he took pains not only to keep\r\nthis declaration good, but also to keep the case so free from the power of\r\ningenious sophistry that the world should not be able to misunderstand\r\nit. By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances, that\r\npoint was reached. Then and thereby the assailants of the government began\r\nthe conflict of arms, without a gun in sight or in expectancy to return\r\ntheir fire, save only the few in the fort sent to that harbor years before\r\nfor their own protection, and still ready to give that protection in\r\nwhatever was lawful. In this act, discarding all else, they have forced\r\nupon the country the distinct issue, \"immediate dissolution or blood.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States. It\r\npresents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional\r\nrepublic or democracy--a government of the people by the same people--can\r\nor cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic\r\nfoes. It presents the question whether discontented individuals, too few\r\nin numbers to control administration according to organic law in any\r\ncase, can always, upon the pretenses made in this case, or on any other\r\npretenses, or arbitrarily without any pretense, break up their government,\r\nand thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth. It\r\nforces us to ask: Is there in all republics this inherent and fatal\r\nweakness? Must a government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties\r\nof its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?\r\n\r\nSo viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the war power\r\nof the government, and so to resist force employed for its destruction by\r\nforce for its preservation.\r\n\r\nThe call was made, and the response of the country was most gratifying,\r\nsurpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation. Yet\r\nnone of the States commonly called slave States, except Delaware, gave\r\na regiment through regular State organization. A few regiments have been\r\norganized within some others of those States by individual enterprise,\r\nand received into the government service. Of course the seceded States,\r\nso called (and to which Texas had been joined about the time of the\r\ninauguration), gave no troops to the cause of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe border States, so called, were not uniform in their action, some\r\nof them being almost for the Union, while in others--as Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas--the Union sentiment was nearly\r\nrepressed and silenced. The course taken in Virginia was the most\r\nremarkable--perhaps the most important. A convention elected by the people\r\nof that State to consider this very question of disrupting the Federal\r\nUnion was in session at the capital of Virginia when Fort Sumter fell. To\r\nthis body the people had chosen a large majority of professed Union men.\r\nAlmost immediately after the fall of Sumter, many members of that majority\r\nwent over to the original disunion minority, and with them adopted an\r\nordinance for withdrawing the State from the Union. Whether this change\r\nwas wrought by their great approval of the assault upon Sumter, or their\r\ngreat resentment at the government's resistance to that assault, is not\r\ndefinitely known. Although they submitted the ordinance for ratification\r\nto a vote of the people, to be taken on a day then somewhat more than\r\na month distant, the convention and the Legislature (which was also in\r\nsession at the same time and place), with leading men of the State not\r\nmembers of either, immediately commenced acting as if the State were\r\nalready out of the Union. They pushed military preparations vigorously\r\nforward all over the State. They seized the United States armory at\r\nHarper's Ferry, and the navy-yard at Gosport, near Norfolk. They received\r\nperhaps invited--into their State large bodies of troops, with their\r\nwarlike appointments, from the so-called seceded States. They formally\r\nentered into a treaty of temporary alliance and co-operation with the\r\nso-called \"Confederate States,\" and sent members to their congress at\r\nMontgomery. And finally, they permitted the insurrectionary government to\r\nbe transferred to their capital at Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia have thus allowed this giant insurrection to make\r\nits nest within her borders; and this government has no choice left but\r\nto deal with it where it finds it. And it has the less regret as the loyal\r\ncitizens have, in due form, claimed its protection. Those loyal citizens\r\nthis government is bound to recognize and protect, as being Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the border States, so called,--in fact, the middle States,--there are\r\nthose who favor a policy which they call \"armed neutrality\"; that is, an\r\narming of those States to prevent the Union forces passing one way, or\r\nthe disunion the other, over their soil. This would be disunion completed.\r\nFiguratively speaking, it would be the building of an impassable wall\r\nalong the line of separation--and yet not quite an impassable one, for\r\nunder the guise of neutrality it would tie the hands of Union men and\r\nfreely pass supplies from among them to the insurrectionists, which it\r\ncould not do as an open enemy. At a stroke it would take all the trouble\r\noff the hands of secession, except only what proceeds from the external\r\nblockade. It would do for the disunionists that which, of all things, they\r\nmost desire--feed them well and give them disunion without a struggle of\r\ntheir own. It recognizes no fidelity to the Constitution, no obligation to\r\nmaintain the Union; and while very many who have favored it are doubtless\r\nloyal citizens, it is, nevertheless, very injurious in effect.\r\n\r\nRecurring to the action of the government, it may be stated that at\r\nfirst a call was made for 75,000 militia; and, rapidly following this,\r\na proclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary\r\ndistricts by proceedings in the nature of blockade. So far all was\r\nbelieved to be strictly legal. At this point the insurrectionists\r\nannounced their purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering.\r\n\r\nOther calls were made for volunteers to serve for three years, unless\r\nsooner discharged, and also for large additions to the regular army and\r\nnavy. These measures, whether strictly legal or not, were ventured\r\nupon, under what appeared to be a popular demand and a public necessity;\r\ntrusting then, as now, that Congress would readily ratify them. It is\r\nbelieved that nothing has been done beyond the constitutional competency\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nSoon after the first call for militia, it was considered a duty to\r\nauthorize the commanding general in proper cases, according to his\r\ndiscretion, to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or,\r\nin other words, to arrest and detain, without resort to the ordinary\r\nprocesses and forms of law, such individuals as he might deem dangerous\r\nto the public safety. This authority has purposely been exercised but very\r\nsparingly. Nevertheless, the legality and propriety of what has been done\r\nunder it are questioned, and the attention of the country has been called\r\nto the proposition that one who has sworn to \"take care that the laws\r\nbe faithfully executed\" should not himself violate them. Of course some\r\nconsideration was given to the questions of power and propriety before\r\nthis matter was acted upon. The whole of the laws which were required to\r\nbe faithfully executed were being resisted and failing of execution in\r\nnearly one third of the States. Must they be allowed to finally fail of\r\nexecution, even had it been perfectly clear that by the use of the\r\nmeans necessary to their execution some single law, made in such extreme\r\ntenderness of the citizen's liberty that, practically, it relieves more\r\nof the guilty than of the innocent, should to a very limited extent be\r\nviolated? To state the question more directly, are all the laws but one\r\nto go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be\r\nviolated? Even in such a case, would not the official oath be broken if\r\nthe government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding\r\nthe single law would tend to preserve it? But it was not believed\r\nthat this question was presented. It was not believed that any law was\r\nviolated. The provision of the Constitution that \"the privilege of the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of\r\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,\" is equivalent to\r\na provision--is a provision--that such privilege may be suspended when, in\r\ncase of rebellion or invasion, the public safety does require it. It was\r\ndecided that we have a case of rebellion, and that the public safety does\r\nrequire the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which was\r\nauthorized to be made. Now it is insisted that Congress, and not the\r\nexecutive, is vested with this power. But the Constitution itself is\r\nsilent as to which or who is to exercise the power; and as the provision\r\nwas plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be believed the\r\nframers of the instrument intended that in every case the danger\r\nshould run its course until Congress could be called together, the very\r\nassembling of which might be prevented, as was intended in this case, by\r\nthe rebellion.\r\n\r\nNo more extended argument is now offered, as an opinion at some length\r\nwill probably be presented by the attorney-general. Whether there shall be\r\nany legislation upon the subject, and if any, what, is submitted entirely\r\nto the better judgment of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe forbearance of this government had been so extraordinary and so long\r\ncontinued as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as if they\r\nsupposed the early destruction of our national Union was probable. While\r\nthis, on discovery, gave the executive some concern, he is now happy\r\nto say that the sovereignty and rights of the United States are now\r\neverywhere practically respected by foreign powers; and a general sympathy\r\nwith the country is manifested throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and the Navy will\r\ngive the information in detail deemed necessary and convenient for your\r\ndeliberation and action; while the executive and all the departments will\r\nstand ready to supply omissions, or to communicate new facts considered\r\nimportant for you to know.\r\n\r\nIt is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this\r\ncontest a short and decisive one: that you place at the control of\r\nthe government for the work at least four hundred thousand men and\r\n$400,000,000. That number of men is about one-tenth of those of proper\r\nages within the regions where, apparently, all are willing to engage; and\r\nthe sum is less than a twenty-third part of the money value owned by the\r\nmen who seem ready to devote the whole. A debt of $600,000,000 now is a\r\nless sum per head than was the debt of our Revolution when we came out of\r\nthat struggle; and the money value in the country now bears even a greater\r\nproportion to what it was then than does the population. Surely each man\r\nhas as strong a motive now to preserve our liberties as each had then to\r\nestablish them.\r\n\r\nA right result at this time will be worth more to the world than ten times\r\nthe men and ten times the money. The evidence reaching us from the country\r\nleaves no doubt that the material for the work is abundant, and that it\r\nneeds only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction, and the hand\r\nof the executive to give it practical shape and efficiency. One of the\r\ngreatest perplexities of the government is to avoid receiving troops\r\nfaster than it can provide for them. In a word, the people will save their\r\ngovernment if the government itself will do its part only indifferently\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nIt might seem, at first thought, to be of little difference whether the\r\npresent movement at the South be called \"secession\" or \"rebellion.\" The\r\nmovers, however, well understand the difference. At the beginning they\r\nknew they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude by\r\nany name which implies violation of law. They knew their people possessed\r\nas much of moral sense, as much of devotion to law and order, and as much\r\npride in and reverence for the history and government of their common\r\ncountry as any other civilized and patriotic people. They knew they\r\ncould make no advancement directly in the teeth of these strong and noble\r\nsentiments. Accordingly, they commenced by an insidious debauching of the\r\npublic mind. They invented an ingenious sophism which, if conceded, was\r\nfollowed by perfectly logical steps, through all the incidents, to the\r\ncomplete destruction of the Union. The sophism itself is that any State of\r\nthe Union may consistently with the national Constitution, and therefore\r\nlawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the Union without the consent of\r\nthe Union or of any other State. The little disguise that the supposed\r\nright is to be exercised only for just cause, themselves to be the sole\r\njudges of its justice, is too thin to merit any notice.\r\n\r\nWith rebellion thus sugar-coated they have been drugging the public mind\r\nof their section for more than thirty years, and until at length they\r\nhave brought many good men to a willingness to take up arms against the\r\ngovernment the day after some assemblage of men have enacted the farcical\r\npretense of taking their State out of the Union, who could have been\r\nbrought to no such thing the day before.\r\n\r\nThis sophism derives much, perhaps the whole, of its currency from the\r\nassumption that there is some omnipotent and sacred supremacy pertaining\r\nto a State--to each State of our Federal Union. Our States have neither\r\nmore nor less power than that reserved to them in the Union by the\r\nConstitution--no one of them ever having been a State out of the Union.\r\nThe original ones passed into the Union even before they cast off their\r\nBritish colonial dependence; and the new ones each came into the Union\r\ndirectly from a condition of dependence, excepting Texas. And even Texas\r\nin its temporary independence was never designated a State. The new ones\r\nonly took the designation of States on coming into the Union, while that\r\nname was first adopted for the old ones in and by the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Therein the \"United Colonies\" were declared to be \"free and\r\nindependent States\"; but even then the object plainly was not to declare\r\ntheir independence of one another or of the Union, but directly the\r\ncontrary, as their mutual pledge and their mutual action before, at the\r\ntime, and afterward, abundantly show. The express plighting of faith by\r\neach and all of the original thirteen in the Articles of Confederation,\r\ntwo years later, that the Union shall be perpetual, is most conclusive.\r\nHaving never been States either in substance or in name outside of the\r\nUnion, whence this magical omnipotence of \"State rights,\" asserting a\r\nclaim of power to lawfully destroy the Union itself? Much is said about\r\nthe \"sovereignty\" of the States; but the word even is not in the national\r\nConstitution, nor, as is believed, in any of the State constitutions. What\r\nis \"sovereignty\" in the political sense of the term? Would it be far wrong\r\nto define it as \"a political community without a political superior\"?\r\nTested by this, no one of our States except Texas ever was a sovereignty.\r\nAnd even Texas gave up the character on coming into the Union; by which\r\nact she acknowledged the Constitution of the United States, and the laws\r\nand treaties of the United States made in pursuance of the Constitution,\r\nto be for her the supreme law of the land. The States have their status in\r\nthe Union, and they have no other legal status. If they break from this,\r\nthey can only do so against law and by revolution. The Union, and not\r\nthemselves separately, procured their independence and their liberty. By\r\nconquest or purchase the Union gave each of them whatever of independence\r\nor liberty it has. The Union is older than any of the States, and, in\r\nfact, it created them as States. Originally some dependent colonies made\r\nthe Union, and, in turn, the Union threw off their old dependence for\r\nthem, and made them States, such as they are. Not one of them ever had\r\na State constitution independent of the Union. Of course, it is not\r\nforgotten that all the new States framed their constitutions before they\r\nentered the Union nevertheless, dependent upon and preparatory to coming\r\ninto the Union.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the States have the powers and rights reserved to them in\r\nand by the national Constitution; but among these surely are not included\r\nall conceivable powers, however mischievous or destructive, but, at most,\r\nsuch only as were known in the world at the time as governmental powers;\r\nand certainly a power to destroy the government itself had never been\r\nknown as a governmental, as a merely administrative power. This relative\r\nmatter of national power and State rights, as a principle, is no other\r\nthan the principle of generality and locality. Whatever concerns the whole\r\nshould be confided to the whole--to the General Government; while whatever\r\nconcerns only the State should be left exclusively to the State. This\r\nis all there is of original principle about it. Whether the national\r\nConstitution in defining boundaries between the two has applied the\r\nprinciple with exact accuracy, is not to be questioned. We are all bound\r\nby that defining, without question.\r\n\r\nWhat is now combated is the position that secession is consistent with the\r\nConstitution--is lawful and peaceful. It is not contended that there is\r\nany express law for it; and nothing should ever be implied as law which\r\nleads to unjust or absurd consequences. The nation purchased with money\r\nthe countries out of which several of these States were formed. Is it just\r\nthat they shall go off without leave and without refunding? The nation\r\npaid very large sums (in the aggregate, I believe, nearly a hundred\r\nmillions) to relieve Florida of the aboriginal tribes. Is it just that she\r\nshall now be off without consent or without making any return? The\r\nnation is now in debt for money applied to the benefit of these so-called\r\nseceding States in common with the rest. Is it just either that creditors\r\nshall go unpaid or the remaining States pay the whole? A part of the\r\npresent national debt was contracted to pay the old debts of Texas. Is it\r\njust that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself?\r\n\r\nAgain, if one State may secede, so may another; and when all shall have\r\nseceded, none is left to pay the debts. Is this quite just for creditors?\r\nDid we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?\r\nIf we now recognize this doctrine by allowing the seceders to go in peace,\r\nit is difficult to see what we can do if others choose to go or to extort\r\nterms upon which they will promise to remain.\r\n\r\nThe seceders insist that our Constitution admits of secession. They\r\nhave assumed to make a national constitution of their own, in which of\r\nnecessity they have either discarded or retained the right of secession\r\nas they insist it exists in ours. If they have discarded it, they thereby\r\nadmit that on principle it ought not to be in ours. If they have retained\r\nit, by their own construction of ours, they show that to be consistent\r\nthey must secede from one another whenever they shall find it the easiest\r\nway of settling their debts, or effecting any other selfish or unjust\r\nobject. The principle itself is one of disintegration and upon which no\r\ngovernment can possibly endure.\r\n\r\nIf all the States save one should assert the power to drive that one out\r\nof the Union, it is presumed the whole class of seceder politicians would\r\nat once deny the power and denounce the act as the greatest outrage upon\r\nState rights. But suppose that precisely the same act, instead of being\r\ncalled \"driving the one out,\" should be called \"the seceding of the others\r\nfrom that one,\" it would be exactly what the seceders claim to do, unless,\r\nindeed, they make the point that the one, because it is a minority,\r\nmay rightfully do what the others, because they are a majority, may not\r\nrightfully do. These politicians are subtle and profound on the rights of\r\nminorities. They are not partial to that power which made the Constitution\r\nand speaks from the preamble calling itself \"We, the People.\"\r\n\r\nIt may well be questioned whether there is to-day a majority of the\r\nlegally qualified voters of any State except perhaps South Carolina in\r\nfavor of disunion. There is much reason to believe that the Union men are\r\nthe majority in many, if not in every other one, of the so-called seceded\r\nStates. The contrary has not been demonstrated in any one of them. It is\r\nventured to affirm this even of Virginia and Tennessee; for the result of\r\nan election held in military camps, where the bayonets are all on one side\r\nof the question voted upon, can scarcely be considered as demonstrating\r\npopular sentiment. At such an election, all that large class who are at\r\nonce for the Union and against coercion would be coerced to vote against\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nIt may be affirmed without extravagance that the free institutions we\r\nenjoy have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole\r\npeople beyond any example in the world. Of this we now have a striking and\r\nan impressive illustration. So large an army as the government has now on\r\nfoot was never before known without a soldier in it but who has taken his\r\nplace there of his own free choice. But more than this, there are many\r\nsingle regiments whose members, one and another, possess full practical\r\nknowledge of all the arts, sciences, professions, and whatever else,\r\nwhether useful or elegant, is known in the world; and there is scarcely\r\none from which there could not be selected a President, a Cabinet, a\r\nCongress, and perhaps a court, abundantly competent to administer the\r\ngovernment itself. Nor do I say this is not true also in the army of\r\nour late friends, now adversaries in this contest; but if it is, so much\r\nbetter the reason why the government which has conferred such benefits on\r\nboth them and us should not be broken up. Whoever in any section proposes\r\nto abandon such a government would do well to consider in deference to\r\nwhat principle it is that he does it; what better he is likely to get in\r\nits stead; whether the substitute will give, or be intended to give, so\r\nmuch of good to the people. There are some foreshadowings on this subject.\r\nOur adversaries have adopted some declarations of independence in which,\r\nunlike the good old one, penned by Jefferson, they omit the words \"all\r\nmen are created equal.\" Why? They have adopted a temporary national\r\nconstitution, in the preamble of which, unlike our good old one, signed by\r\nWashington, they omit \"We, the People,\" and substitute, \"We, the deputies\r\nof the sovereign and independent States.\" Why? Why this deliberate\r\npressing out of view the rights of men and the authority of the people?\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a people's contest. On the side of the Union it is\r\na struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of\r\ngovernment whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men to\r\nlift artificial weights from all shoulders; to clear the paths of laudable\r\npursuit for all; to afford all an unfettered start, and a fair chance\r\nin the race of life. Yielding to partial and temporary departures,\r\nfrom necessity; this is the leading object of the government for whose\r\nexistence we contend.\r\n\r\nI am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and appreciate\r\nthis. It is worthy of note that, while in this the government's hour of\r\ntrial large numbers of those in the army and navy who have been favored\r\nwith the offices have resigned and proved false to the hand which had\r\npampered them, not one common soldier or common sailor is known to have\r\ndeserted his flag.\r\n\r\nGreat honor is due to those officers who remained true, despite the\r\nexample of their treacherous associates; but the greatest honor, and most\r\nimportant fact of all, is the unanimous firmness of the common soldiers\r\nand common sailors. To the last man, so far as known, they have\r\nsuccessfully resisted the traitorous efforts of those whose commands,\r\nbut an hour before, they obeyed as absolute law. This is the patriotic\r\ninstinct of the plain people. They understand, without an argument, that\r\nthe destroying of the government which was made by Washington means no\r\ngood to them.\r\n\r\nOur popular government has often been called an experiment. Two points in\r\nit our people have already settled--the successful establishing and\r\nthe successful administering of it. One still remains--its successful\r\nmaintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it. It is\r\nnow for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry\r\nan election can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots are the rightful\r\nand peaceful successors of bullets; and that when ballots have fairly\r\nand constitutionally decided, there can be no successful appeal back\r\nto bullets; that there can be no successful appeal, except to ballots\r\nthemselves, at succeeding elections. Such will be a great lesson of peace:\r\nteaching men that what they cannot take by an election, neither can they\r\ntake it by a war; teaching all the folly of being the beginners of a war.\r\n\r\nLest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as to what is\r\nto be the course of the government toward the Southern States after the\r\nrebellion shall have been suppressed, the executive deems it proper to say\r\nit will be his purpose then, as ever, to be guided by the Constitution and\r\nthe laws; and that he probably will have no different understanding of the\r\npowers and duties of the Federal Government relatively to the rights of\r\nthe States and the people, under the Constitution, than that expressed in\r\nthe inaugural address.\r\n\r\nHe desires to preserve the government, that it may be administered for all\r\nas it was administered by the men who made it. Loyal citizens everywhere\r\nhave the right to claim this of their government, and the government has\r\nno right to withhold or neglect it. It is not perceived that in giving it\r\nthere is any coercion, any conquest, or any subjugation, in any just sense\r\nof those terms.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides, and all the States have accepted the provision,\r\nthat \"the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a\r\nrepublican form of government.\" But if a State may lawfully go out of\r\nthe Union, having done so it may also discard the republican form of\r\ngovernment, so that to prevent its going out is an indispensable means to\r\nthe end of maintaining the guarantee mentioned; and when an end is\r\nlawful and obligatory, the indispensable means to it are also lawful and\r\nobligatory.\r\n\r\nIt was with the deepest regret that the executive found the duty of\r\nemploying the war power in defense of the government forced upon him. He\r\ncould but perform this duty or surrender the existence of the government.\r\nNo compromise by public servants could, in this case, be a cure; not that\r\ncompromises are not often proper, but that no popular government can long\r\nsurvive a marked precedent that those who carry an election can only save\r\nthe government from immediate destruction by giving up the main point upon\r\nwhich the people gave the election. The people themselves, and not their\r\nservants, can safely reverse their own deliberate decisions.\r\n\r\nAs a private citizen the executive could not have consented that these\r\ninstitutions shall perish; much less could he in betrayal of so vast and\r\nso sacred a trust as these free people had confided to him. He felt that\r\nhe had no moral right to shrink, nor even to count the chances of his own\r\nlife, in what might follow. In full view of his great responsibility he\r\nhas, so far, done what he has deemed his duty. You will now, according to\r\nyour own judgment, perform yours. He sincerely hopes that your views and\r\nyour action may so accord with his as to assure all faithful citizens who\r\nhave been disturbed in their rights of a certain and speedy restoration to\r\nthem, under the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nAnd having thus chosen our course, without guile and with pure purpose,\r\nlet us renew our trust in God, and go forward without fear and with manly\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, July 6, 1861.\r\n\r\nHON. SEC. OF INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Please ask the Comr. of Indian Affairs, and of the Gen'l\r\nLand Office to come with you, and see me at once. I want the assistance of\r\nall of you in overhauling the list of appointments a little before I send\r\nthem to the Senate.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th\r\ninstant, requesting a copy of correspondence upon the subject of the\r\nincorporation of the Dominican republic with the Spanish monarchy, I\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of State; to whom the resolution was\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 11, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of correspondence between the Secretary\r\nof State and her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary accredited to this government, relative to the exhibition\r\nof the products of industry of all nations, which is to take place at\r\nLondon in the course of next year. As citizens of the United States may\r\njustly pride themselves upon their proficiency in industrial arts, it is\r\ndesirable that they should have proper facilities toward taking part in\r\nthe exhibition. With this view I recommend such legislation by Congress at\r\nthis session as may be necessary for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 16, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nAs the United States have, in common with Great Britain and France, a deep\r\ninterest in the preservation and development of the fisheries adjacent to\r\nthe northeastern coast and islands of this continent, it seems proper that\r\nwe should concert with the governments of those countries such measures as\r\nmay be conducive to those important objects. With this view I transmit to\r\nCongress a copy of a correspondence between the Secretary of State and\r\nthe British minister here, in which the latter proposes, on behalf of\r\nhis government, the appointment of a joint commission to inquire into\r\nthe matter, in order that such ulterior measures may be adopted as may be\r\nadvisable for the objects proposed. Such legislation recommended as may be\r\nnecessary to enable the executive to provide for a commissioner on behalf\r\nof the United States:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JULY 19, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JULY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL:\r\n\r\nI have agreed, and do agree, that the two Indian regiments named within\r\nshall be accepted if the act of Congress shall admit it. Let there be no\r\nfurther question about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDA OF MILITARY POLICY SUGGESTED BY THE BULL RUN DEFEAT. JULY 23,\r\n1861\r\n\r\n1. Let the plan for making the blockade effective be pushed forward with\r\nall possible despatch.\r\n\r\n2. Let the volunteer forces at Fort Monroe and vicinity under General\r\nButler be constantly drilled, disciplined, and instructed without more for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\n3. Let Baltimore be held as now, with a gentle but firm and certain hand.\r\n\r\n4. Let the force now under Patterson or Banks be strengthened and made\r\nsecure in its position.\r\n\r\n5. Let the forces in Western Virginia act till further orders according to\r\ninstructions or orders from General McClellan.\r\n\r\n6. [Let] General Fremont push forward his organization and operations\r\nin the West as rapidly as possible, giving rather special attention to\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\n7. Let the forces late before Manassas, except the three-months men,\r\nbe reorganized as rapidly as possible in their camps here and about\r\nArlington.\r\n\r\n8. Let the three-months forces who decline to enter the longer service be\r\ndischarged as rapidly as circumstances will permit.\r\n\r\n9. Let the new volunteer forces be brought forward as fast as possible,\r\nand especially into the camps on the two sides of the river here.\r\n\r\nWhen the foregoing shall be substantially attended to:\r\n\r\n1. Let Manassas Junction (or some point on one or other of the railroads\r\nnear it) and Strasburg be seized, and permanently held, with an open\r\nline from Washington to Manassas, and an open line from Harper's Ferry to\r\nStrasburg the military men to find the way of doing these.\r\n\r\n2. This done, a joint movement from Cairo on Memphis; and from Cincinnati\r\non East Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., July 24, 1861\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Together with the regiments of three years' volunteers which the\r\ngovernment already has in service in your State, enough to make eight in\r\nall, if tendered in a reasonable time, will be accepted, the new regiments\r\nto be taken, as far as convenient, from the three months' men and officers\r\njust discharged, and to be organized, equipped, and sent forward as fast\r\nas single regiments are ready, On the same terms as were those already in\r\nthe service from that State.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nThis order is entered in the War Department, and the Governor of New\r\nJersey is authorized to furnish the regiments with wagons and horses.\r\n\r\nS. CAMERON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 22d\r\ninstant; requesting a copy of the correspondence between this, government\r\nand foreign powers with reference to maritime right, I transmit a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 25, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 15th\r\ninstant, requesting a copy of the correspondence between this government\r\nand foreign powers on the subject of the existing insurrection in the\r\nUnited States, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 25, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CHASE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, JULY 16, 1861\r\n\r\nMR CHASE:--The bearer, Mr. ------, wants ------ in the custom house at\r\nBaltimore. If his recommendations are satisfactory, and I recollect them\r\nto have been so, the fact that he is urged by the Methodists should be in\r\nhis favor, as they complain of us some.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 24th\r\ninstant, asking the grounds, reasons, and evidence upon which the police\r\nCommissioners of Baltimore were arrested and are now detained as prisoners\r\nat Port McHenry, I have to state that it is judged to be incompatible with\r\nthe public interest at this time to furnish the information called for by\r\nthe resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JULY 27, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 19th instant requesting\r\ninformation concerning the quasi armistice alluded to in my message of the\r\n4th instant, I transmit a report from the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nJULY 30, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 23d instant requesting\r\ninformation concerning the imprisonment of Lieutenant John J. Worden\r\n(John L. Worden) of the United States navy, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nJuly 30, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER TO UNITED STATES MARSHALS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.C., JULY 31, 1861\r\n\r\nThe Marshals of the United States in the vicinity of forts where political\r\nprisoners are held will supply decent lodging and sustenance for such\r\nprisoners unless they shall prefer to provide in those respects for\r\nthemselves, in which case they will be allowed to do so by the commanding\r\nofficer in charge.\r\n\r\nApproved, and the Secretary of the State will transmit the order to the\r\nMarshals, to the Lieutenant-General, and the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of yesterday,\r\nrequesting information regarding the imprisonment of loyal citizens of the\r\nUnited States by the forces now in rebellion against this government,\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, and the copy of a\r\ntelegraphic despatch by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, August 2, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of your honorable body of date July 31, 1861,\r\nrequesting the President to inform the Senate whether the Hon. James\r\nH. Lane, a member of that body from Kansas, has been appointed a\r\nbrigadier-general in the army of the United States, and if so, whether\r\nhe has accepted such appointment, I have the honor to transmit herewith\r\ncertain papers, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which, taken together,\r\nexplain themselves, and which contain all the information I possess upon\r\nthe questions propounded.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention, as shown by my letter of June 20, 1861, to appoint\r\nHon. James H. Lane, of Kansas, a brigadier-general of United States\r\nvolunteers in anticipation of the act of Congress, since passed, for\r\nraising such volunteers; and I have no further knowledge upon the subject,\r\nexcept as derived from the papers herewith enclosed.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, August 5, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CAMERON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, AUGUST 7, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The within paper, as you see, is by HON. John S. Phelps\r\nand HON. Frank P. Blair, Jr., both members of the present Congress from\r\nMissouri. The object is to get up an efficient force of Missourians in the\r\nsouthwestern part of the State. It ought to be done, and Mr. Phelps ought\r\nto have general superintendence of it. I see by a private report to me\r\nfrom the department that eighteen regiments are already accepted from\r\nMissouri. Can it not be arranged that part of them (not yet organized, as\r\nI understand) may be taken from the locality mentioned and put under the\r\ncontrol of Mr. Phelps, and let him have discretion to accept them for a\r\nshorter term than three years--or the war--understanding, however, that\r\nhe will get them for the full term if he can? I hope this can be done,\r\nbecause Mr. Phelps is too zealous and efficient and understands his ground\r\ntoo well for us to lose his service. Of course provision for arming,\r\nequipping, etc., must be made. Mr. Phelps is here, and wishes to carry\r\nhome with him authority for this matter.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF A NATIONAL FAST-DAY, AUGUST 12, 1861.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas a joint committee of both houses of Congress has waited on the\r\nPresident of the United States and requested him to \"recommend a day of\r\npublic humiliation, prayer, and fasting to be observed by the people of\r\nthe United States with religious solemnities and the offering of fervent\r\nsupplications to Almighty God for the safety and welfare of these States,\r\nHis blessings on their arms, and a speedy restoration of peace\"; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is fit and becoming in all people at all times to acknowledge\r\nand revere the supreme government of God, to bow in humble submission to\r\nHis chastisements, to confess and deplore their sins and transgressions in\r\nthe full conviction that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,\r\nand to pray with all fervency and contrition for the pardon of their past\r\noffences and for a blessing upon their present and prospective action; and\r\n\r\nWhereas when our own beloved country, once, by the blessing of God,\r\nunited, prosperous, and happy, is now afflicted with faction and civil\r\nwar, it is peculiarly fit for us to recognize the hand of God in this\r\nterrible visitation, and in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and\r\ncrimes as a nation and as individuals to humble ourselves before Him and\r\nto pray for His mercy-to pray that we may be spared further punishment,\r\nthough most justly deserved, that our arms may be blessed and made\r\neffectual for the re-establishment of order, law, and peace throughout\r\nthe wide extent of our country, and that the inestimable boon of civil and\r\nreligious liberty, earned under His guidance and blessing by the labors\r\nand sufferings of our fathers, may be restored in all its original\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nTherefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do appoint\r\nthe last Thursday in September next as a day of humiliation, prayer, and\r\nfasting for all the people of the nation. And I do earnestly recommend to\r\nall the people, and especially to all ministers and teachers of religion\r\nof all denominations and to all heads of families, to observe and keep\r\nthat day according to their several creeds and modes of worship in all\r\nhumility and with all religious solemnity, to the end that the united\r\nprayer of the nation may ascend to the Throne of Grace and bring down\r\nplentiful blessings upon our country.\r\n\r\n     In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand\r\n     and caused the seal of the United States to\r\n [SEAL.]\r\n     be affixed, this twelfth day of August, A. D.\r\n     1861, and of the independence of the United\r\n     States of America the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n By the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES POLLOCK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, AUGUST 15, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES POLLOCK.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--You must make a job for the bearer of this--make a job of it\r\nwith the collector and have it done. You can do it for me and you must.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR O. P. MORTON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., AUGUST 15, 1861\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR MORTON, Indiana: Start your four regiments to St. Louis at the\r\nearliest moment possible. Get such harness as may be necessary for your\r\nrifled gums. Do not delay a single regiment, but hasten everything forward\r\nas soon as any one regiment is ready. Have your three additional regiments\r\norganized at once. We shall endeavor to send you the arms this week.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION FORBIDDING INTERCOURSE WITH REBEL STATES, AUGUST 16, 1861.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas on the fifteenth day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-one,\r\nthe President of the United States, in view of an insurrection against the\r\nlaws, Constitution, and government of the United States which had broken\r\nout within the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and in pursuance of the provisions\r\nof the act entitled \"An act to provide for calling forth the militia\r\nto execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel\r\ninvasions, and to repeal the act now in force for that purpose,\" approved\r\nFebruary twenty-eighth, seventeen hundred and ninety-five, did call forth\r\nthe militia to suppress said insurrection, and to cause the laws of the\r\nUnion to be duly executed, and the insurgents have failed to disperse\r\nby the time directed by the President; and whereas such insurrection\r\nhas since broken out and yet exists within the States of Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas; and whereas the insurgents in all the\r\nsaid States claim to act under the authority thereof, and such claim is\r\nnot disclaimed or repudiated by the persons exercising the functions of\r\ngovernment in such State or States, or in the part or parts thereof in\r\nwhich such combinations exist, nor has such insurrection been suppressed\r\nby said States:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, in\r\npursuance of an act of Congress approved July thirteen, eighteen hundred\r\nand sixty-one, do hereby declare that the inhabitants of the said States\r\nof Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,\r\nAlabama, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida (except\r\nthe inhabitants of that part of the State of Virginia lying west of the\r\nAllegheny Mountains, and of such other parts of that State, and the other\r\nStates hereinbefore named, as may maintain a loyal adhesion to the Union\r\nand the Constitution, or may be time to time occupied and controlled by\r\nforces of the United States engaged in the dispersion of said insurgents),\r\nare in a state of insurrection against the United States, and that all\r\ncommercial intercourse between the same and the inhabitants thereof, with\r\nthe exceptions aforesaid, and the citizens of other States and other parts\r\nof the United States, is unlawful, and will remain unlawful until such\r\ninsurrection shall cease or has been suppressed; that all goods and\r\nchattels, wares and merchandise, coming from any of said States, with the\r\nexceptions aforesaid, into other parts of the United States, without the\r\nspecial license and permission of the President, through the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, or proceeding to any of said States, with the exceptions\r\naforesaid, by land or water, together with the vessel or vehicle\r\nconveying the same, or conveying persons to or from said States, with\r\nsaid exceptions, will be forfeited to the United States; and that from\r\nand after fifteen days from the issuing of this proclamation all ships and\r\nvessels belonging in whole or in part to any citizen or inhabitant of any\r\nof said States, with said exceptions, found at sea, or in any port of the\r\nUnited States, will be forfeited to the United States; and I hereby enjoin\r\nupon all district attorneys, marshals, and officers of the revenue and of\r\nthe military and naval forces of the United States to be vigilant in\r\nthe execution of said act, and in the enforcement of the penalties and\r\nforfeitures imposed or declared by it; leaving any party who may think\r\nhimself aggrieved thereby to his application to the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury for the remission of any penalty or forfeiture, which the said\r\nSecretary is authorized by law to grant if, in his judgment, the special\r\ncircumstances of any case shall require such remission.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand,....\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:   WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of Sate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CAMERON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, August 17, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Unless there be reason to the contrary, not known to\r\nme, make out a commission for Simon B. Buckner, of Kentucky, as a\r\nbrigadier-general of volunteers. It is to be put into the hands of General\r\nAnderson, and delivered to General Buckner or not, at the discretion of\r\nGeneral Anderson. Of course it is to remain a secret unless and until the\r\ncommission is delivered.\r\n\r\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nSame day made.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MAGOFFIN,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., AUGUST 24, 1861\r\n\r\nTo HIS EXCELLENCY B. MAGOFFIN, Governor of the State of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Your letter of the 19th instant, in which you urge the \"removal from\r\nthe limits of Kentucky of the military force now organized and in camp\r\nwithin that State,\" is received.\r\n\r\nI may not possess full and precisely accurate knowledge upon this subject;\r\nbut I believe it is true that there is a military force in camp within\r\nKentucky, acting by authority of the United States, which force is not\r\nvery large, and is not now being augmented.\r\n\r\nI also believe that some arms have been furnished to this force by the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI also believe this force consists exclusively of Kentuckians, having\r\ntheir camp in the immediate vicinity of their own homes, and not assailing\r\nor menacing any of the good people of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nIn all I have done in the premises I have acted upon the urgent\r\nsolicitation of many Kentuckians, and in accordance with what I believed,\r\nand still believe, to be the wish of a majority of all the Union-loving\r\npeople of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nWhile I have conversed on this subject with many eminent men of Kentucky,\r\nincluding a large majority of her members of Congress, I do not remember\r\nthat any one of them, or any other person, except your Excellency and the\r\nbearers of your Excellency's letter, has urged me to remove the military\r\nforce from Kentucky or to disband it. One other very worthy citizen of\r\nKentucky did solicit me to have the augmenting of the force suspended for\r\na time.\r\n\r\nTaking all the means within my reach to form a judgment, I do not believe\r\nit is the popular wish of Kentucky that this force shall be removed beyond\r\nher limits; and, with this impression, I must respectfully decline to so\r\nremove it.\r\n\r\nI most cordially sympathize with your Excellency in the wish to preserve\r\nthe peace of my own native State, Kentucky. It is with regret I search,\r\nand cannot find, in your not very short letter, any declaration or\r\nintimation that you entertain any desire for the preservation of the\r\nFederal Union.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., SEPTEMBER 2, 1861\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Two points in your proclamation of August 30 give me some\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nFirst. Should you shoot a man, according to the proclamation, the\r\nConfederates would very certainly shoot our best men in their hands in\r\nretaliation; and so, man for man, indefinitely. It is, therefore, my order\r\nthat you allow no man to be shot under the proclamation without first\r\nhaving my approbation or consent.\r\n\r\nSecond. I think there is great danger that the closing paragraph, in\r\nrelation to the confiscation of property and the liberating slaves of\r\ntraitorous owners, will alarm our Southern Union friends and turn them\r\nagainst us; perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky. Allow\r\nme, therefore, to ask that you will, as of your own motion, modify that\r\nparagraph so as to conform to the first and fourth sections of the act of\r\nCongress entitled \"An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary\r\npurposes,\" approved August 6, 1861, and a copy of which act I herewith\r\nsend you.\r\n\r\nThis letter is written in a spirit of caution, and not of censure. I send\r\nit by special messenger, in order that it may certainly and speedily reach\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNORS\r\n\r\nWASHBURN OF MAINE, FAIRBANKS OF VERMONT, BERRY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, ANDREW OF\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, BUCKINGHAM OF CONNECTICUT, AND SPRAGUE OF RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, September 11, 1861.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler proposes raising in New England six regiments, to be\r\nrecruited and commanded by himself, and to go on special service.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad if you, as governor of ------, will answer by telegraph if\r\nyou consent.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., SEPTEMBER 11, 1861\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL JOHN C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nSIR:-Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2d instant, is just\r\nreceived. Assuming that you, upon the ground, could better judge of the\r\nnecessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing\r\nyour proclamation of August 30 I perceived no general objection to it. The\r\nparticular clause, however, in relation to the confiscation of property\r\nand the liberation of slaves appeared to me to be objectionable in its\r\nnonconformity to the act of Congress passed the 6th of last August upon\r\nthe same subjects; and hence I wrote you, expressing my wish that that\r\nclause should be modified accordingly. Your answer, just received,\r\nexpresses the preference on your part that I should make an open order for\r\nthe modification, which I very cheerfully do. It is therefore ordered that\r\nthe said clause of said proclamation be so modified, held, and construed\r\nas to conform to, and not to transcend, the provisions on the same subject\r\ncontained in the act of Congress entitled \"An act to confiscate property\r\nused for insurrectionary purposes,\" approved August 6, 1861, and that said\r\nact be published at length with this order.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 12, 1861\r\n\r\nMrs. GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MADAM:--Your two notes of to-day are before me. I answered the\r\nletter you bore me from General Fremont on yesterday, and not hearing from\r\nyou during the day, I sent the answer to him by mail. It is not exactly\r\ncorrect, as you say you were told by the elder Mr. Blair, to say that I\r\nsent Postmaster-General Blair to St. Louis to examine into that department\r\nand report. Postmaster-General Blair did go, with my approbation, to see\r\nand converse with General Fremont as a friend. I do not feel authorized to\r\nfurnish you with copies of letters in my possession without the consent of\r\nthe writers. No impression has been made on my mind against the honor or\r\nintegrity of General Fremont, and I now enter my protest against being\r\nunderstood as acting in any hostility toward him.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH HOLT,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, SEPTEMBER 12, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. JOSEPH HOLT.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of this day in relation to the late proclamation of\r\nGeneral Fremont is received yesterday I addressed a letter to him, by\r\nmail, on the same subject, and which is to be made public when he receives\r\nit. I herewith send you a copy of that letter, which perhaps shows my\r\nposition as distinctly as any new one I could write. I will thank you not\r\nto make it public until General Fremont shall have had time to receive the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SCOTT\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 16, 1861.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Since conversing with you I have concluded to request you\r\nto frame an order for recruiting North Carolinians at Fort Hatteras. I\r\nsuggest it to be so framed as for us to accept a smaller force--even a\r\ncompany--if we cannot get a regiment or more. What is necessary to now\r\nsay about officers you will judge. Governor Seward says he has a nephew\r\n(Clarence A. Seward, I believe) who would be willing to go and play\r\ncolonel and assist in raising the force. Still it is to be considered\r\nwhether the North Carolinians will not prefer officers of their own. I\r\nshould expect they would.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CAMERON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, September 18, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR. MY DEAR SIR:--To guard against misunderstanding,\r\nI think fit to say that the joint expedition of the army and navy agreed\r\nupon some time since, and in which General T. W. Sherman was and is to\r\nbear a conspicuous part, is in no wise to be abandoned, but must be ready\r\nto move by the 1st of, or very early in, October. Let all preparations go\r\nforward accordingly.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL FREMONT,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER 12, 1861\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nGovernor Morton telegraphs as follows: \"Colonel Lane, just arrived by\r\nspecial train, represents Owensborough, forty miles above Evansville, in\r\npossession of secessionists. Green River is navigable. Owensborough must\r\nbe seized. We want a gunboat sent up from Paducah for that purpose.\" Send\r\nup the gunboat if, in your discretion, you think it right. Perhaps you had\r\nbetter order those in charge of the Ohio River to guard it vigilantly at\r\nall points.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo O. H. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON SEPTEMBER 22, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. O. H. BROWNING.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 17th is just received; and coming from you, I\r\nconfess it astonishes me. That you should object to my adhering to a law\r\nwhich you had assisted in making and presenting to me less than a month\r\nbefore is odd enough. But this is a very small part. General Fremont's\r\nproclamation as to confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves\r\nis purely political and not within the range of military law or necessity.\r\nIf a commanding general finds a necessity to seize the farm of a private\r\nowner for a pasture, an encampment, or a fortification, he has the right\r\nto do so, and to so hold it as long as the necessity lasts; and this is\r\nwithin military law, because within military necessity. But to say the\r\nfarm shall no longer belong to the owner, or his heirs forever, and this\r\nas well when the farm is not needed for military purposes as when it is,\r\nis purely political, without the savor of military law about it. And the\r\nsame is true of slaves. If the general needs them, he can seize them\r\nand use them; but when the need is past, it is not for him to fix their\r\npermanent future condition. That must be settled according to laws made\r\nby law-makers, and not by military proclamations. The proclamation in the\r\npoint in question is simply \"dictatorship.\" It assumes that the general\r\nmay do anything he pleases confiscate the lands and free the slaves of\r\nloyal people, as well as of disloyal ones. And going the whole figure,\r\nI have no doubt, would be more popular with some thoughtless people than\r\nthat which has been done, But I cannot assume this reckless position, nor\r\nallow others to assume it on my responsibility.\r\n\r\nYou speak of it as being the only means of saving the government. On\r\nthe contrary, it is itself the surrender of the government. Can it be\r\npretended that it is any longer the Government of the United States--any\r\ngovernment of constitution and laws wherein a general or a president may\r\nmake permanent rules of property by proclamation? I do not say Congress\r\nmight not with propriety pass a law on the point, just such as General\r\nFremont proclaimed.\r\n\r\nI do not say I might not, as a member of Congress, vote for it. What I\r\nobject to is, that I, as President, shall expressly or impliedly seize and\r\nexercise the permanent legislative functions of the government.\r\n\r\nSo much as to principle. Now as to policy. No doubt the thing was popular\r\nin some quarters, and would have been more so if it had been a general\r\ndeclaration of emancipation. The Kentucky Legislature would not budge till\r\nthat proclamation was modified; and General Anderson telegraphed me\r\nthat on the news of General Fremont having actually issued deeds of\r\nmanumission, a whole company of our volunteers threw down their arms and\r\ndisbanded. I was so assured as to think it probable that the very arms\r\nwe had furnished Kentucky would be turned against us. I think to lose\r\nKentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game. Kentucky gone, we\r\ncannot hold Missouri, nor, as I think, Maryland. These all against us,\r\nand the job on our hands is too large for us. We would as well consent\r\nto separation at once, including the surrender of this Capital. On the\r\ncontrary, if you will give up your restlessness for new positions, and\r\nback me manfully on the grounds upon which you and other kind friends\r\ngave me the election and have approved in my public documents, we shall\r\ngo through triumphantly. You must not understand I took my course on the\r\nproclamation because of Kentucky. I took the same ground in a private\r\nletter to General Fremont before I heard from Kentucky.\r\n\r\nYou think I am inconsistent because I did not also forbid General Fremont\r\nto shoot men under the proclamation. I understand that part to be within\r\nmilitary law, but I also think, and so privately wrote General Fremont,\r\nthat it is impolitic in this, that our adversaries have the power, and\r\nwill certainly exercise it, to shoot as many of our men as we shoot of\r\ntheirs. I did not say this in the public letter, because it is a subject I\r\nprefer not to discuss in the hearing of our enemies.\r\n\r\nThere has been no thought of removing General Fremont on any ground\r\nconnected with his proclamation, and if there has been any wish for his\r\nremoval on any ground, our mutual friend Sam. Glover can probably tell you\r\nwhat it was. I hope no real necessity for it exists on any ground.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM FOR A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n[OCTOBER 1?] 1861\r\n\r\nOn or about the 5th of October (the exact date to be determined hereafter)\r\nI wish a movement made to seize and hold a point on the railroad\r\nconnecting Virginia and Tennessee near the mountain-pass called Cumberland\r\nGap. That point is now guarded against us by Zollicoffer, with 6000 or\r\n8000 rebels at Barboursville Ky.,--say twenty-five miles from the Gap,\r\ntoward Lexington. We have a force of 5000 or 6000 under General Thomas,\r\nat Camp Dick Robinson, about twenty-five miles from Lexington and\r\nseventy-five from Zollicoffer's camp, On the road between the two. There\r\nis not a railroad anywhere between Lexington and the point to be seized,\r\nand along the whole length of which the Union sentiment among the people\r\nlargely predominates. We have military possession of the railroad from\r\nCincinnati to Lexington, and from Louisville to Lexington, and some\r\nhome guards, under General Crittenden, are on the latter line. We have\r\npossession of the railroad from Louisville to Nashville, Tenn., so far\r\nas Muldraugh's Hill, about forty miles, and the rebels have possession of\r\nthat road all south of there. At the Hill we have a force of 8000, under\r\nGeneral Sherman, and about an equal force of rebels is a very short\r\ndistance south, under General Buckner.\r\n\r\nWe have a large force at Paducah, and a smaller at Port Holt, both on the\r\nKentucky side, with some at Bird's Point, Cairo, Mound City, Evansville,\r\nand New Albany, all on the other side, and all which, with the gunboats on\r\nthe river, are perhaps sufficient to guard the Ohio from Louisville to its\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nAbout supplies of troops, my general idea is that all from Wisconsin,\r\nMinnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas, not now elsewhere, be\r\nleft to Fremont. All from Indiana and Michigan, not now elsewhere, be sent\r\nto Anderson at Louisville. All from Ohio needed in western Virginia be\r\nsent there, and any remainder be sent to Mitchell at Cincinnati, for\r\nAnderson. All east of the mountains be appropriated to McClellan and to\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nAs to movements, my idea is that the one for the coast and that on\r\nCumberland Gap be simultaneous, and that in the meantime preparation,\r\nvigilant watching, and the defensive only be acted upon; this, however,\r\nnot to apply to Fremont's operations in northern and middle Missouri. That\r\nbefore these movements Thomas and Sherman shall respectively watch but\r\nnot attack Zollicoffer and Buckner. That when the coast and Gap movements\r\nshall be ready Sherman is merely to stand fast, while all at Cincinnati\r\nand all at Louisville, with all on the line, concentrate rapidly at\r\nLexington, and thence to Thomas's camp, joining him, and the whole thence\r\nupon the Gap. It is for the military men to decide whether they can find a\r\npass through the mountains at or near the Gap which cannot be defended by\r\nthe enemy with a greatly inferior force, and what is to be done in regard\r\nto this.\r\n\r\nThe coast and Gap movements made, Generals McClellan and Fremont, in\r\ntheir respective departments, will avail themselves of any advantages the\r\ndiversions may present.\r\n\r\n[He was entirely unable to get this started, Sherman would have taken\r\nan active part if given him, the others were too busy getting lines of\r\ncommunication guarded--and discovering many \"critical\" supply items that\r\nhad not been sent them. Also the commanding general did not like it.

After, and not till after, the delivery to General\r\nFremont, let the inclosure addressed to General Hunter be delivered to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n(General Orders No. 18.) HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, October 24, 1861\r\n\r\nMajor-General Fremont, of the United States Army, the present commander\r\nof the Western Department of the same, will, on the receipt of this order,\r\ncall Major-General Hunter, of the United States Volunteers, to relieve him\r\ntemporarily in that command, when he (Major-General Fremont) will report\r\nto general headquarters by letter for further orders.\r\n\r\nWINFIELD SCOTT. By command: E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, October 24, 1861\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE WEST.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The command of the Department of the West having devolved upon you,\r\nI propose to offer you a few suggestions. Knowing how hazardous it is\r\nto bind down a distant commander in the field to specific lines and\r\noperations, as so much always depends on a knowledge of localities and\r\npassing events, it is intended, therefore, to leave a considerable margin\r\nfor the exercise of your judgment and discretion.\r\n\r\nThe main rebel army (Price's) west of the Mississippi is believed to have\r\npassed Dade County in full retreat upon northwestern Arkansas, leaving\r\nMissouri almost freed from the enemy, excepting in the southeast of the\r\nState. Assuming this basis of fact, it seems desirable, as you are not\r\nlikely to overtake Price, and are in danger of making too long a line from\r\nyour own base of supplies and reinforcements, that you should give up the\r\npursuit, halt your main army, divide it into two corps of observation, one\r\noccupying Sedalia and the other Rolla, the present termini of railroads;\r\nthen recruit the condition of both corps by re-establishing and improving\r\ntheir discipline and instructions, perfecting their clothing and\r\nequipments, and providing less uncomfortable quarters. Of course, both\r\nrailroads must be guarded and kept open, judiciously employing just so\r\nmuch force as is necessary for this. From these two points, Sedalia and\r\nRolla, and especially in judicious cooperation with Lane on the Kansas\r\nborder, it would be so easy to concentrate and repel any army of the enemy\r\nreturning on Missouri from the southwest, that it is not probable any such\r\nattempt will be made before or during the approaching cold weather. Before\r\nspring the people of Missouri will probably be in no favorable mood\r\nto renew for next year the troubles which have so much afflicted and\r\nimpoverished them during this. If you adopt this line of policy, and if,\r\nas I anticipate, you will see no enemy in great force approaching, you\r\nwill have a surplus of force which you can withdraw from these points and\r\ndirect to others as may be needed, the railroads furnishing ready means\r\nof reinforcing these main points if occasion requires. Doubtless local\r\nuprisings will for a time continue to occur, but these can be met by\r\ndetachments and local forces of our own, and will ere long tire out of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWhile, as stated in the beginning of the letter, a large discretion must\r\nbe and is left with yourself, I feel sure that an indefinite pursuit of\r\nPrice or an attempt by this long and circuitous route to reach Memphis\r\nwill be exhaustive beyond endurance, and will end in the loss of the whole\r\nforce engaged in it.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER RETIRING GENERAL SCOTT AND APPOINTING\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN HIS SUCCESSOR. (General Orders, No.94.)\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 1, 1861\r\n\r\nThe following order from the President of the United States, announcing\r\nthe retirement from active command of the honored veteran Lieutenant\r\ngeneral Winfield Scott, will be read by the army with profound regret:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 1861\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of November, A.D. 1861, upon his own application to the\r\nPresident of the United States, Brevet Lieutenant-General Winfield Scott\r\nis ordered to be placed, and hereby is placed, upon the list of retired\r\nofficers of the army of the United States, without reduction in his\r\ncurrent pay, subsistence, or allowances.\r\n\r\nThe American people will hear with sadness and deep emotion that General\r\nScott has withdrawn from the active control of the army, while the\r\nPresident and a unanimous Cabinet express their own and the nation's\r\nsympathy in his personal affliction and their profound sense of the\r\nimportant public services rendered by him to his country during his long\r\nand brilliant career, among which will ever be gratefully distinguished\r\nhis faithful devotion to the Constitution, the Union, and the flag when\r\nassailed by parricidal rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President is pleased to direct that Major general George B. McClellan\r\nassume the command of the army of the United States. The headquarters of\r\nthe army will be established in the city of Washington. All communications\r\nintended for the commanding general will hereafter be addressed direct\r\nto the adjutant-general. The duplicate returns, orders, and other papers\r\nheretofore sent to the assistant adjutant-general, headquarters of the\r\narmy, will be discontinued.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:  L. THOMAS, Adjutant General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER APPROVING THE PLAN OF GOVERNOR GAMBLE OF MISSOURI.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nNovember 5, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of the State of Missouri, acting under the direction of the\r\nconvention of that State, proposes to the Government of the United States\r\nthat he will raise a military force to serve within the State as State\r\nmilitia during the war there, to cooperate with the troops in the\r\nservice of the United States in repelling the invasion of the State and\r\nsuppressing rebellion therein; the said State militia to be embodied\r\nand to be held in the camp and in the field, drilled, disciplined, and\r\ngoverned according to the Army Regulations and subject to the Articles of\r\nWar; the said State militia not to be ordered out of the State except for\r\nthe immediate defense of the State of Missouri, but to co-operate with the\r\ntroops in the service of the United States in military operations within\r\nthe State or necessary to its defense, and when officers of the State\r\nmilitia act with officers in the service of the United States of the same\r\ngrade the officers of the United States service shall command the combined\r\nforce; the State militia to be armed, equipped, clothed, subsisted,\r\ntransported, and paid by the United States during such time as they shall\r\nbe actually engaged as an embodied military force in service in accordance\r\nwith regulations of the United States Army or general orders as issued\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nIn order that the Treasury of the United States may not be burdened with\r\nthe pay of unnecessary officers, the governor proposes that, although\r\nthe State law requires him to appoint upon the general staff an\r\nadjutant-general, a commissary-general, an inspector-general, a\r\nquartermaster-general, a paymaster-general, and a surgeon-general, each\r\nwith the rank of colonel of cavalry, yet he proposes that the\r\nGovernment of the United States pay only the adjutant-general, the\r\nquartermaster-general, and inspector-general, their services being\r\nnecessary in the relations which would exist between the State militia and\r\nthe United States. The governor further proposes that while he is\r\nallowed by the State law to appoint aides-de-camp to the governor at his\r\ndiscretion, with the rank of colonel, three only shall be reported to the\r\nUnited States for payment. He also proposes that the State militia\r\nshall be commanded by a single major-general and by such number of\r\nbrigadier-generals as shall allow one for a brigade of not less than four\r\nregiments, and that no greater number of staff officers shall be appointed\r\nfor regimental, brigade, and division duties than as provided for in the\r\nact of Congress of the 22d July, 1861; and that, whatever be the rank of\r\nsuch officers as fixed by the law of the State, the compensation that they\r\nshall receive from the United States shall only be that which belongs to\r\nthe rank given by said act of Congress to officers in the United States\r\nservice performing the same duties.\r\n\r\nThe field officers of a regiment in the State militia are one colonel, one\r\nlieutenant-colonel, and one major, and the company officers are a captain,\r\na first lieutenant, and a second lieutenant. The governor proposes that,\r\nas the money to be disbursed is the money of the United States, such staff\r\nofficers in the service of the United States as may be necessary to act\r\nas disbursing officers for the State militia shall be assigned by the War\r\nDepartment for that duty; or, if such cannot be spared from their present\r\nduty, he will appoint such persons disbursing officers for the State\r\nmilitia as the President of the United States may designate. Such\r\nregulations as may be required, in the judgment of the President, to\r\ninsure regularity of returns and to protect the United States from any\r\nfraudulent practices shall be observed and obeyed by all in office in the\r\nState militia.\r\n\r\nThe above propositions are accepted on the part of the United States, and\r\nthe Secretary of War is directed to make the necessary orders upon the\r\nOrdnance, Quartermaster's, Commissary, Pay, and Medical departments\r\nto carry this agreement into effect. He will cause the necessary\r\nstaff officers in the United States service to be detailed for duty in\r\nconnection with the Missouri State militia, and will order them to make\r\nthe necessary provision in their respective offices for fulfilling this\r\nagreement. All requisitions upon the different officers of the United\r\nStates under this agreement to be made in substance in the same mode for\r\nthe Missouri State militia as similar requisitions are made for troops in\r\nthe service of the United States; and the Secretary of War will cause\r\nany additional regulations that may be necessary to insure regularity\r\nand economy in carrying this agreement into effect to be adopted and\r\ncommunicated to the Governor of Missouri for the government of the\r\nMissouri State militia.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nNovember 6, 1861.\r\n\r\nThis plan approved, with the modification that the governor stipulates\r\nthat when he commissions a major-general of militia it shall be the same\r\nperson at the time in command of the United States Department of the\r\nWest; and in case the United States shall change such commander of the\r\ndepartment, he (the governor) will revoke the State commission given to\r\nthe person relieved and give one to the person substituted to the United\r\nStates command of said department.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MINISTER FROM SWEDEN.\r\n\r\nNovember 8, 1861.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I receive with great pleasure a Minister from Sweden. That pleasure\r\nis enhanced by the information which preceded your arrival here, that his\r\nMajesty, your sovereign, had selected you to fill the mission upon the\r\ngrounds of your derivation from an ancestral stock identified with the\r\nmost glorious era of your country's noble history, and your own eminent\r\nsocial and political standing in Sweden. This country, sir, maintains, and\r\nmeans to maintain, the rights of human nature, and the capacity of men for\r\nself-government. The history of Sweden proves that this is the faith of\r\nthe people of Sweden, and we know that it is the faith and practice of\r\ntheir respected sovereign. Rest assured, therefore, that we shall be found\r\nalways just and paternal in our transactions with your government, and\r\nthat nothing will be omitted on my part to make your residence in this\r\ncapital agreeable to yourself and satisfactory to your government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT AUTHORIZING MARTIAL LAW IN SAINT LOUIS.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, November 20, 1861. (Received Nov. 20th.)\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN,\r\n\r\nFor the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nNo written authority is found here to declare and enforce martial law in\r\nthis department. Please send me such written authority and telegraph me\r\nthat it has been sent by mail.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.] November 21, 1861.\r\n\r\nIf General McClellan and General Halleck deem it necessary to declare and\r\nmaintain martial law in Saint Louis, the same is hereby authorized.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFER TO COOPERATE AND GIVE SPECIAL LINE OF INFORMATION TO HORACE GREELEY\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR WALKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 21, 1861\r\n\r\nDEAR GOVERNOR:--I have thought over the interview which Mr. Gilmore has\r\nhad with Mr. Greeley, and the proposal that Greeley has made to Gilmore,\r\nnamely, that he [Gilmore] shall communicate to him [Greeley] all that he\r\nlearns from you of the inner workings of the administration, in return\r\nfor his [Greeley's] giving such aid as he can to the new magazine, and\r\nallowing you [Walker] from time to time the use of his [Greeley's] columns\r\nwhen it is desirable to feel of, or forestall, public opinion on important\r\nsubjects. The arrangement meets my unqualified approval, and I shall\r\nfurther it to the extent of my ability, by opening to you--as I do\r\nnow--fully the policy of the Government,--its present views and future\r\nintentions when formed, giving you permission to communicate them to\r\nGilmore for Greeley; and in case you go to Europe I will give these\r\nthings direct to Gilmore. But all this must be on the express and explicit\r\nunderstanding that the fact of these communications coming from me shall\r\nbe absolutely confidential,--not to be disclosed by Greeley to his nearest\r\nfriend, or any of his subordinates. He will be, in effect, my mouthpiece,\r\nbut I must not be known to be the speaker.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you that I have the highest confidence in Mr. Greeley. He\r\nis a great power. Having him firmly behind me will be as helpful to me as\r\nan army of one hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\nThis was to be most severely regretted, when Greeley became a traitor\r\nto the cause, editorialized for compromise and separation--and promoted\r\nMcClellan as Democratic candidate for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nThat he has ever kicked the traces has been owing to his not being fully\r\ninformed. Tell Gilmore to say to him that, if he ever objects to my\r\npolicy, I shall be glad to have him state to me his views frankly and\r\nfully. I shall adopt his if I can. If I cannot, I will at least tell him\r\nwhy. He and I should stand together, and let no minor differences come\r\nbetween us; for we both seek one end, which is the saving of our\r\ncountry. Now, Governor, this is a longer letter than I have written in\r\na month,--longer than I would have written for any other man than Horace\r\nGreeley.\r\n\r\nYour friend, truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--The sooner Gilmore sees Greeley the better, as you may before long\r\nthink it wise to ventilate our policy on the Trent affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER AUTHORIZING GENERAL HALLECK TO SUSPEND THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2, 1861.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK, Commanding in the Department of Missouri.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--As an insurrection exists in the United States, and is in arms\r\nin the State of Missouri, you are hereby authorized and empowered to\r\nsuspend the writ of habeas corpus within the limits of the military\r\ndivision under your command, and to exercise martial law as you find it\r\nnecessary in your discretion to secure the public safety and the authority\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed at Washington, this second day of December,\r\nA.D. 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 3, 1861\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:--In the midst\r\nof unprecedented political troubles we have cause of great gratitude to\r\nGod for unusual good health and most abundant harvests.\r\n\r\nYou will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of the\r\ntimes our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound\r\nsolicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nA disloyal portion of the American people have during the whole year been\r\nengaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which\r\nendures factious domestic division is exposed to disrespect abroad,\r\nand one party, if not both, is sure sooner or later to invoke foreign\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nNations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the\r\ncounsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition, although measures\r\nadopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious\r\nto those adopting them.\r\n\r\nThe disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of\r\nour country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked\r\nabroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably\r\nexpected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to\r\nassume, that foreign nations in this case, discarding all moral, social,\r\nand treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy\r\nrestoration of commerce, including especially the acquisition of cotton,\r\nthose nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object\r\nmore directly or clearly through the destruction than through the\r\npreservation of the Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign\r\nnations are actuated by no higher principle than this, I am quite sure a\r\nsound argument could be made to show them that they can reach their aim\r\nmore readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving\r\nencouragement to it.\r\n\r\nThe principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign\r\nnations to hostility against us, as already intimated, is the\r\nembarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably saw\r\nfrom the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign as\r\nour domestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive that the\r\neffort for disunion produces the existing difficulty, and that one strong\r\nnation promises more durable peace and a more extensive, valuable, and\r\nreliable commerce than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states,\r\nbecause, whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integrity\r\nof our country and the stability of our government mainly depend not upon\r\nthem, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the\r\nAmerican people. The correspondence itself, with the usual reservations,\r\nis herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nI venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and\r\nliberality toward foreign powers, averting causes of irritation and with\r\nfirmness maintaining our own rights and honor.\r\n\r\nSince, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other state,\r\nforeign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that\r\nadequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defenses\r\non every side. While under this general recommendation provision for\r\ndefending our seacoast line readily occurs to the mind, I also in the same\r\nconnection ask the attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers.\r\nIt is believed that some fortifications and depots of arms and munitions,\r\nwith harbor and navigation improvements, all at well-selected points\r\nupon these, would be of great importance to the national defense and\r\npreservation I ask attention to the views of the Secretary of War,\r\nexpressed in his report, upon the same general subject.\r\n\r\nI deem it of importance that the loyal regions of east Tennessee and\r\nwestern North Carolina should be connected with Kentucky and other\r\nfaithful parts of the Union by rail-road. I therefore recommend, as a\r\nmilitary measure, that Congress provide for the construction of such\r\nrail-road as speedily as possible. Kentucky will no doubt co-operate, and\r\nthrough her Legislature make the most judicious selection of a line. The\r\nnorthern terminus must connect with some existing railroad, and whether\r\nthe route shall be from Lexington or Nicholasville to the Cumberland Gap,\r\nor from Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in the direction of Knoxville, or\r\non some still different line, can easily be determined. Kentucky and the\r\nGeneral Government co-operating, the work can be completed in a very short\r\ntime, and when done it will be not only of vast present usefulness but\r\nalso a valuable permanent improvement, worth its cost in all the future.\r\n\r\nSome treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and having\r\nno grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will be submitted\r\nto the Senate for their consideration.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt\r\na desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war, we have removed all\r\nobstructions from the way of this humane reform except such as are merely\r\nof temporary and accidental occurrence.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the correspondence between her Britannic\r\nMajesty's minister accredited to this government and the Secretary of\r\nState relative to the detention of the British ship Perthshire in June\r\nlast by the United States steamer Massachusetts for a supposed breach\r\nof the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious\r\nmisapprehension of the facts, and as justice requires that we should\r\ncommit no belligerent act not founded in strict right as sanctioned by\r\npublic law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the\r\nreasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his annual message to\r\nCongress in December last in regard to the disposition of the surplus\r\nwhich will probably remain after satisfying the claims of American\r\ncitizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under\r\nthe act of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, it should not be deemed\r\nadvisable to carry that recommendation into effect, I would suggest that\r\nauthority be given for investing the principal, or the proceeds of the\r\nsurplus referred to, in good securities, with a view to the satisfaction\r\nof such other just claims of our citizens against China as are not\r\nunlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nBy the act of the 5th of August last Congress authorized the President to\r\ninstruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against\r\nand to capture pirates. His authority has been exercised in a single\r\ninstance only. For the more effectual protection of our extensive and\r\nvaluable commerce in the Eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it\r\nwould also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to\r\nrecapture any prizes which pirates may make of United States vessels and\r\ntheir cargoes, and the consular courts now established by law in Eastern\r\ncountries to adjudicate the cases in the event that this should not be\r\nobjected to by the local authorities.\r\n\r\nIf any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding\r\nour recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Haiti and Liberia,\r\nI am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel\r\npolicy in regard to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit for\r\nyour consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining\r\na charge d'affaires near each of those new States. It does not admit of\r\ndoubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable\r\ntreaties with them.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the treasury during the period which has elapsed since\r\nyour adjournment have been conducted with signal success. The patriotism\r\nof the people has placed at the disposal of the government the large means\r\ndemanded by the public exigencies. Much of the national loan has been\r\ntaken by citizens of the industrial classes, whose confidence in their\r\ncountry's faith and zeal for their country's deliverance from present\r\nperil have induced them to contribute to the support of the government\r\nthe whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar\r\nobligations to economy in disbursement and energy in action.\r\n\r\nThe revenue from all sources, including loans, for the financial year\r\nending on the 30th of June, 1861, was $86,835,900.27, and the expenditures\r\nfor the same period, including payments on account of the public debt,\r\nwere $84,578,834.47, leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st of July\r\nof $2,257,065.80. For the first quarter of the financial year ending on\r\nthe 30th of September, 1861, the receipts from all sources, including\r\nthe balance of the 1st of July, were $102,532,509.27, and the expenses\r\n$98,239733.09, leaving a balance on the 1st of October, 1861, of\r\n$4,292,776.18.\r\n\r\nEstimates for the remaining three quarters of the year and for the\r\nfinancial year 1863, together with his views of ways and means for meeting\r\nthe demands contemplated by them, will be submitted to Congress by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the expenditures\r\nmade necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of the\r\nloyal people, and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far\r\nsustained the government will continue to sustain it till peace and union\r\nshall again bless the land.\r\n\r\nI respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War for information\r\nrespecting the numerical strength of the army and for recommendations\r\nhaving in view an increase of its efficiency and the well-being of the\r\nvarious branches of the service intrusted to his care. It is gratifying to\r\nknow that the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the occasion,\r\nand that the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which\r\nCongress authorized me to call into the field.\r\n\r\nI refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion\r\nto the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops and\r\nto the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the Secretary for an organization of the militia\r\nupon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to the future safety\r\nof the country, and is commended to the serious attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe large addition to the regular army, in connection with the defection\r\nthat has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives\r\npeculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of\r\ncadets to the greatest capacity of the Military Academy.\r\n\r\nBy mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to provide chaplains for\r\nhospitals occupied by volunteers. This subject was brought to my notice,\r\nand I was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of which,\r\nproperly addressed, has been delivered to each of the persons, and at the\r\ndates respectively named and stated in a schedule, containing also the\r\nform of the letter, marked A, and herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties designated at the\r\ntimes respectively stated in the schedule, and have labored faithfully\r\ntherein ever since. I therefore recommend that they be compensated at\r\nthe same rate as chaplains in the army. I further suggest that general\r\nprovision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals, as well as with\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail the operations\r\nof that branch of the service, the activity and energy which have\r\ncharacterized its administration, and the results of measures to increase\r\nits efficiency and power such have been the additions, by construction and\r\npurchase, that it may almost be said a navy has been created and brought\r\ninto service since our difficulties commenced.\r\n\r\nBesides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than ever before\r\nassembled under our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds which\r\nhave increased our naval renown.\r\n\r\nI would invite special attention to the recommendation of the Secretary\r\nfor a more perfect organization of the navy by introducing additional\r\ngrades in the service.\r\n\r\nThe present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and the\r\nsuggestions submitted by the department will, it is believed, if adopted,\r\nobviate the difficulties alluded to, promote harmony, and increase the\r\nefficiency of the navy.\r\n\r\nThere are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court--two by\r\nthe decease of Justices Daniel and McLean and one by the resignation of\r\nJustice Campbell. I have so far forborne making nominations to fill these\r\nvacancies for reasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoing judges\r\nresided within the States now overrun by revolt, so that if successors\r\nwere appointed in the same localities they could not now serve upon their\r\ncircuits; and many of the most competent men there probably would not take\r\nthe personal hazard of accepting to serve, even here, upon the Supreme\r\nbench. I have been unwilling to throw all the appointments north-ward,\r\nthus disabling myself from doing justice to the South on the return of\r\npeace; although I may remark that to transfer to the North one which has\r\nheretofore been in the South would not, with reference to territory and\r\npopulation, be unjust.\r\n\r\nDuring the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean his circuit\r\ngrew into an empire-altogether too large for any one judge to give the\r\ncourts therein more than a nominal attendance--rising in population from\r\n1,470,018 in 1830 to 6,151,405 in 1860.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the country generally has outgrown our present judicial\r\nsystem. If uniformity was at all intended, the system requires that all\r\nthe States shall be accommodated with circuit courts, attended by Supreme\r\njudges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida,\r\nTexas, California, and Oregon have never had any such courts. Nor can this\r\nwell be remedied without a change in the system, because the adding of\r\njudges to the Supreme Court, enough for the accommodation of all parts\r\nof the country with circuit courts, would create a court altogether too\r\nnumerous for a judicial body of any sort. And the evil, if it be one, will\r\nincrease as new States come into the Union. Circuit courts are useful or\r\nthey are not useful. If useful, no State should be denied them; if\r\nnot useful, no State should have them. Let them be provided for all or\r\nabolished as to all.\r\n\r\nThree modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be\r\nan improvement upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of\r\nconvenient number in every event; then, first, let the whole country be\r\ndivided into circuits of convenient size, the Supreme judges to serve in a\r\nnumber of them corresponding to their own number, and independent circuit\r\njudges be provided for all the rest; or, secondly, let the Supreme judges\r\nbe relieved from circuit duties and circuit judges provided for all the\r\ncircuits; or, thirdly, dispense with circuit courts altogether, leaving\r\nthe judicial functions wholly to the district courts and an independent\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n\r\nI respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the present\r\ncondition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able\r\nto find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which\r\nconstantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of\r\nthem. Since the Organization of the government, Congress has enacted some\r\n5000 acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than 6000 closely printed\r\npages and are scattered through many volumes. Many of these acts have been\r\ndrawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions\r\nare often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other, or\r\nat least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the\r\nbest-informed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law really\r\nis.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as\r\nplain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass\r\nas may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the\r\nLegislature and the perspicuity of its language. This well done would, I\r\nthink, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist\r\nin the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the\r\npeople, by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible form\r\nthe laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties.\r\n\r\nI am informed by some whose opinions I respect that all the acts of\r\nCongress now in force and of a permanent and general nature might be\r\nrevised and rewritten so as to be embraced in one volume (or at most two\r\nvolumes) of ordinary and convenient size; and I respectfully recommend to\r\nCongress to consider of the subject, and if my suggestion be approved\r\nto devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the\r\nattainment of the end proposed.\r\n\r\nOne of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is\r\nthe entire suppression in many places of all the ordinary means of\r\nadministering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of existing\r\nlaw. This is the case, in whole or in part, in all the insurgent States;\r\nand as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of those\r\nStates the practical evil becomes more apparent. There are no courts\r\nor officers to whom the citizens of other States may apply for the\r\nenforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent\r\nStates, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims.\r\nSome have estimated it as high as $200,000,000, due in large part from\r\ninsurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are even now making\r\ngreat sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I have been urgently solicited to establish, by\r\nmilitary power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I\r\nhave thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the end\r\nproposed--the collection of the debts--was just and right in itself, but\r\nbecause I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in\r\nthe unusual exercise of power. But the powers of Congress, I suppose, are\r\nequal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the whole matter to\r\nCongress, with the hope that a plan maybe devised for the administration\r\nof justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and Territories as\r\nmay be under the control of this government, whether by a voluntary return\r\nto allegiance and order or by the power of our arms; this, however, not\r\nto be a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute, and to cease as\r\nsoon as the ordinary courts can be reestablished in peace.\r\n\r\nIt is important that some more convenient means should be provided, if\r\npossible, for the adjustment of claims against the government, especially\r\nin view of their increased number by reason of the war. It is as much the\r\nduty of government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of\r\ncitizens as it is to administer the same between private individuals. The\r\ninvestigation and adjudication of claims in their nature belong to\r\nthe judicial department. Besides, it is apparent that the attention of\r\nCongress will be more than usually engaged for some time to come with\r\ngreat national questions. It was intended by the organization of the\r\nCourt of Claims mainly to remove this branch of business from the halls of\r\nCongress; but, while the court has proved to be an effective and valuable\r\nmeans of investigation, it in great degree fails to effect the object of\r\nits creation for want of power to make its judgments final.\r\n\r\nFully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger of the subject,\r\nI commend to your careful consideration whether this power of making\r\njudgments final may not properly be given to the court, reserving the\r\nright of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme Court, with such other\r\nprovisions as experience may have shown to be necessary.\r\n\r\nI ask attention to the report of the Postmaster general, the following\r\nbeing a summary statement of the condition of the department:\r\n\r\nThe revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1861, including the annual permanent appropriation of $700,000 for the\r\ntransportation of \"free mail matter,\" was $9,049,296.40, being about 2 per\r\ncent. less than the revenue for 1860.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures were $13,606,759.11, showing a decrease of more than\r\n8 per cent. as compared with those of the previous year and leaving\r\nan excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of\r\n$4,557,462.71.\r\n\r\nThe gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at\r\nan increase of 4 per cent. on that of 1861, making $8,683,000, to which\r\nshould be added the earnings of the department in carrying free matter,\r\nviz., $700,000, making $9,383,000.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leaving an\r\nestimated deficiency of $3,145,000 to be supplied from the treasury in\r\naddition to the permanent appropriation.\r\n\r\nThe present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this\r\nDistrict across the Potomac River at the time of establishing the capital\r\nhere was eminently wise, and consequently that the relinquishment of\r\nthat portion of it which lies within the State of Virginia was unwise and\r\ndangerous. I submit for your consideration the expediency of regaining\r\nthat part of the District and the restoration of the original boundaries\r\nthereof through negotiations with the State of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying\r\ndocuments, exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public\r\nbusiness pertaining to that department. The depressing influences of the\r\ninsurrection have been specially felt in the operations of the Patent and\r\nGeneral Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of public lands\r\nduring the past year have exceeded the expenses of our land system only\r\nabout $200,000. The sales have been entirely suspended in the Southern\r\nStates, while the interruptions to the business of the country and the\r\ndiversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service have\r\nobstructed settlements in the new States and Territories of the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about\r\n$100,000.00 rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to\r\nmake it self-sustaining.\r\n\r\nThe demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by\r\nthe insurrection. Numerous applications for pensions, based upon the\r\ncasualties of the existing war, have already been made. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of the\r\nbounty of the government are in the ranks of the insurgent army or\r\ngiving them aid and comfort. The Secretary of the Interior has directed\r\na suspension of the payment of the pensions of such persons upon proof\r\nof their disloyalty. I recommend that Congress authorize that officer to\r\ncause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the government with the Indian tribes have been greatly\r\ndisturbed by the insurrection, especially in the southern superintendency\r\nand in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of Kansas is in the\r\npossession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The agents of the United\r\nStates appointed since the 4th of March for this superintendency have been\r\nunable to reach their posts, while the most of those who were in office\r\nbefore that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause, and assume\r\nto exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the\r\ninsurrectionists. It has been stated in the public press that a portion of\r\nthose Indians have been organized as a military force and are attached\r\nto the army of the insurgents. Although the government has no official\r\ninformation upon this subject, letters have been written to the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs by several prominent chiefs giving\r\nassurance of their loyalty to the United States and expressing a wish for\r\nthe presence of Federal troops to protect them. It is believed that upon\r\nthe repossession of the country by the Federal forces the Indians will\r\nreadily cease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former relations\r\nto the government.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has not\r\na department nor a bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in\r\nthe government. While it is fortunate that this great interest is so\r\nindependent in its nature as not to have demanded and extorted more from\r\nthe government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something\r\nmore cannot be given voluntarily with general advantage.\r\n\r\nAnnual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures would present a fund of information of great practical value\r\nto the country. While I make no suggestion as to details, I venture the\r\nopinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade\r\nhas been confided to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of\r\ngratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of\r\nthis inhuman traffic have been recently attended with unusual success.\r\nFive vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and\r\ncondemned. Two mates of vessels engaged in the trade and one person in\r\nequipping a vessel as a slaver have been convicted and subjected to the\r\npenalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain, taken with a cargo of\r\nAfricans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of\r\noffense under our laws, the punishment of which is death.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, created by the last\r\nCongress, have been organized, and civil administration has been\r\ninaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when it is\r\nconsidered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these\r\nnew countries when the Federal officers arrived there.\r\n\r\nThe abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security and\r\nprotection afforded by organized government, will doubtless invite to them\r\na large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country\r\nto its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the Legislature\r\nof Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the\r\nTerritory. So far the authority of the United States has been upheld in\r\nall the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in the future. I commend\r\ntheir interests and defense to the enlightened and generous care of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests of\r\nthe District of Columbia. The insurrection has been the cause of\r\nmuch suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no\r\nrepresentative in Congress that body should not overlook their just claims\r\nupon the government.\r\n\r\nAt your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the\r\nPresident to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of\r\nthe industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the\r\nindustry of all nations to be holden at London in the year 1862. I regret\r\nto say I have been unable to give personal attention to this subject--a\r\nsubject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively and intimately\r\nconnected with the material prosperity of the world. Through the\r\nSecretaries of State and of the Interior a plan or system has been devised\r\nand partly matured, and which will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nUnder and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled \"An act to confiscate\r\nproperty used for insurrectionary purposes,\" approved August 6, 1861, the\r\nlegal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other\r\npersons have become forfeited, and numbers of the latter thus liberated\r\nare already dependent on the United States, and must be provided for in\r\nsome way. Besides this, it is not impossible that some of the States\r\nwill pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively, and by\r\noperation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for\r\ndisposal. In such case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting\r\nsuch persons from such States, according to some mode of valuation, in\r\nlieu, pro tanto, of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on\r\nwith such States respectively; that such persons, on such acceptance by\r\nthe General Government, be at once deemed free, and that in any event\r\nsteps be taken for colonizing both classes (or the one first mentioned if\r\nthe other shall not be brought into existence) at some place or places in\r\na climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too, whether\r\nthe free colored people already in the United States could not, so far as\r\nindividuals may desire, be included in such colonization.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of\r\nterritory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended\r\nin the territorial acquisition. Having practised the acquisition of\r\nterritory for nearly sixty years, the question of constitutional power to\r\ndo so is no longer an open one with us. The power was questioned at first\r\nby Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded\r\nhis scruples on the plea of great expediency. If it be said that the only\r\nlegitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white\r\nmen, this measure effects that object, for emigration of colored men\r\nleaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here. Mr.\r\nJefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring Louisiana more on\r\npolitical and commercial grounds than on providing room for population.\r\n\r\nOn this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money with\r\nthe acquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount to absolute\r\nnecessity--that without which the government itself cannot be perpetuated?\r\n\r\nThe war continues. In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing\r\nthe insurrection I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable\r\nconflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and\r\nremorseless revolutionary struggle. I have therefore in every case thought\r\nit proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary\r\nobject of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not\r\nof vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade\r\nof the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force by\r\nproclamation the law of Congress enacted at the late session for closing\r\nthose ports.\r\n\r\nSo also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligations\r\nof law, instead of transcending I have adhered to the act of Congress to\r\nconfiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon\r\nthe same subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered.\r\nThe Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be\r\nemployed. We should not be in haste to determine that radical and\r\nextreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration and the\r\nmessage to Congress at the late special session were both mainly\r\ndevoted to topics domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and\r\nconsequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract to or\r\nfrom the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in those\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nThe last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at the\r\nassault upon Fort Sumter, and a general review of what has occurred since\r\nmay not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain then is much better\r\ndefined and more distinct now, and the progress of events is plainly in\r\nthe right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a strong support\r\nfrom north of Mason and Dixon's line, and the friends of the Union were\r\nnot free from apprehension on the point. This, however, was soon settled\r\ndefinitely, and on the right side. South of the line noble little Delaware\r\nled off right from the first. Maryland was made to seem against the Union.\r\nOur soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned, and railroads torn up\r\nwithin her limits, and we were many days at one time without the ability\r\nto bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital. Now her bridges\r\nand railroads are repaired and open to the government; she already gives\r\nseven regiments to the cause of the Union, and none to the enemy; and\r\nher people, at a regular election, have sustained the Union by a larger\r\nmajority and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any\r\ncandidate or any question. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now\r\ndecidedly and, I think, unchangeably ranged on the side of the Union.\r\nMissouri is comparatively quiet, and, I believe, can, not again be overrun\r\nby the insurrectionists. These three States of Maryland, Kentucky, and\r\nMissouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have\r\nnow an aggregate of not less than forty thousand in the field for the\r\nUnion, while of their citizens certainly not more than a third of that\r\nnumber, and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful existence, are in\r\narms against us. After a somewhat bloody struggle of months, winter closes\r\non the Union people of western Virginia, leaving them masters of their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAn insurgent force of about fifteen hundred, for months dominating\r\nthe narrow peninsular region constituting the counties of Accomac and\r\nNorthampton, and known as Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with some\r\ncontiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people\r\nthere have renewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the\r\nold flag. This leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac or\r\neast of the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\nAlso we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the\r\nsouthern coast of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee Island (near Savannah),\r\nand Ship Island; and we likewise have some general accounts of popular\r\nmovements in behalf of the Union in North Carolina and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThese things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is advancing steadily\r\nand certainly southward.\r\n\r\nSince your last adjournment Lieutenant-General Scott has retired from the\r\nhead of the army. During his long life the nation has not been unmindful\r\nof his merit; yet on calling to mind how faithfully, ably, and brilliantly\r\nhe has served the country, from a time far back in our history, when few\r\nof the now living had been born, and thenceforward continually, I\r\ncannot but think we are still his debtors. I submit, therefore, for your\r\nconsideration what further mark of recognition is due to him, and to\r\nourselves as a grateful people.\r\n\r\nWith the retirement of General Scott came the Executive duty of\r\nappointing in his stead a general-in-chief of the army. It is a fortunate\r\ncircumstance that neither in council nor country was there, so far as I\r\nknow, any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be selected.\r\nThe retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor of General\r\nMcClellan for the position, and in this the nation seemed to give a\r\nunanimous concurrence. The designation of General McClellan is therefore\r\nin considerable degree the selection of the country as well as of the\r\nExecutive, and hence there is better reason to hope there will be given\r\nhim the confidence and cordial support thus by fair implication promised,\r\nand without which he cannot with so full efficiency serve the country.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones, and\r\nthe saying is true if taken to mean no more than that an army is better\r\ndirected by a single mind, though inferior, than by two superior ones at\r\nvariance and cross-purposes with each other.\r\n\r\nAnd the same is true in all joint operations wherein those engaged can\r\nhave none but a common end in view and can differ only as to the choice\r\nof means. In a storm at sea no one on hoard can wish the ship to sink, and\r\nyet not unfrequently all go down together because too many will direct and\r\nno single mind can be allowed to control.\r\n\r\nIt continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not\r\nexclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government--the\r\nrights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most\r\ngrave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the general\r\ntone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the abridgment of the\r\nexisting right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to\r\nparticipate in the selection of public officers except the legislative\r\nboldly advocated, with labored arguments to prove that large control of\r\nthe people in government is the source of all political evil. Monarchy\r\nitself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit\r\nraising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism. It\r\nis not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made\r\nin favor of popular institutions, but there is one point, with its\r\nconnections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief\r\nattention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with, if\r\nnot above, labor in the structure of government. It is assumed that labor\r\nis available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless\r\nsomebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to\r\nlabor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital\r\nshall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent, or\r\nbuy them and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so\r\nfar, it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers\r\nor what we call slaves. And further, it is assumed that whoever is once a\r\nhired laborer is fixed in that condition for life.\r\n\r\nNow there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is\r\nthere any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition\r\nof a hired laborer. Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences\r\nfrom them are groundless.\r\n\r\nLabor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of\r\nlabor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor\r\nis the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.\r\nCapital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other\r\nrights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a\r\nrelation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. The error is\r\nin assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation.\r\nA few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their\r\ncapital hire or buy another few to labor for them. A large majority belong\r\nto neither class--neither work for others nor have others working for\r\nthem. In most of the Southern States a majority of the whole people of\r\nall colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large\r\nmajority are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their families--wives,\r\nsons, and daughters,--work for themselves on their farms, in their houses,\r\nand in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no\r\nfavors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the\r\nother. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle\r\ntheir own labor with capital; that is, they labor with their own hands and\r\nalso buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed and\r\nnot a distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of\r\nthis mixed class.\r\n\r\nAgain, as has already been said, there is not of necessity any such thing\r\nas the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life. Many\r\nindependent men everywhere in these States a few years back in their lives\r\nwere hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors\r\nfor wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for\r\nhimself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length\r\nhires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous\r\nand prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and\r\nconsequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all. No men\r\nliving are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty;\r\nnone less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly\r\nearned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power which they\r\nalready possess, and which if surrendered will surely be used to close the\r\ndoor of advancement against such as they and to fix new disabilities and\r\nburdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost.\r\n\r\nFrom the first taking of our national census to the last are seventy\r\nyears, and we find our population at the end of the period eight times as\r\ngreat as it was at the beginning. The increase of those other things which\r\nmen deem desirable has been even greater. We thus have at one view what\r\nthe popular principle, applied to government through the machinery of\r\nthe States and the Union, has produced in a given time, and also what if\r\nfirmly maintained it promises for the future. There are already among\r\nus those who if the Union be preserved will live to see it contain\r\n200,000,000. The struggle of to-day is not altogether for to-day; it is\r\nfor a vast future also. With a reliance on Providence all the more firm\r\nand earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events have devolved\r\nupon us.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I am, as you\r\nintimate, losing much of the great confidence I placed in you, not from\r\nany act or omission of yours touching the public service, up to the time\r\nyou were sent to Leavenworth, but from the flood of grumbling despatches\r\nand letters I have seen from you since. I knew you were being ordered\r\nto Leavenworth at the time it was done; and I aver that with as tender a\r\nregard for your honor and your sensibilities as I had for my own, it never\r\noccurred to me that you were being \"humiliated, insulted, and disgraced\";\r\nnor have I, up to this day, heard an intimation that you have been\r\nwronged, coming from any one but yourself. No one has blamed you for the\r\nretrograde movement from Springfield, nor for the information you gave\r\nGeneral Cameron; and this you could readily understand, if it were not\r\nfor your unwarranted assumption that the ordering you to Leavenworth must\r\nnecessarily have been done as a punishment for some fault. I thought then,\r\nand think yet, the position assigned to you is as responsible, and as\r\nhonorable, as that assigned to Buell--I know that General McClellan\r\nexpected more important results from it. My impression is that at the\r\ntime you were assigned to the new Western Department, it had not been\r\ndetermined to replace General Sherman in Kentucky; but of this I am not\r\ncertain, because the idea that a command in Kentucky was very desirable,\r\nand one in the farther West undesirable, had never occurred to me. You\r\nconstantly speak of being placed in command of only 3000. Now, tell me, is\r\nthis not mere impatience? Have you not known all the while that you are to\r\ncommand four or five times that many.\r\n\r\nI have been, and am sincerely your friend; and if, as such, I dare to make\r\na suggestion, I would say you are adopting the best possible way to ruin\r\nyourself. \"Act well your part, there all the honor lies.\" He who does\r\nsomething at the head of one regiment, will eclipse him who does nothing\r\nat the head of a hundred.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Are General Buell and yourself in concert? When\r\nhe moves on Bowling Green, what hinders it being reinforced from Columbus?\r\nA simultaneous movement by you on Columbus might prevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

BUELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, January 1, 1862\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL BUELL, Louisville:\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan should not yet be disturbed with business. I think you\r\nbetter get in concert with General Halleck at once. I write you to-night.\r\nI also telegraph and write Halleck.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, January 1, 1862\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan is not dangerously ill, as I hope, but would better not\r\nbe disturbed with business. I am very anxious that, in case of General\r\nBuell's moving toward Nashville, the enemy shall not be greatly\r\nreinforced, and I think there is danger he will be from Columbus. It seems\r\nto me that a real or feigned attack upon Columbus from up the river at\r\nthe same time would either prevent this or compensate for it by throwing\r\nColumbus into our hands. I wrote General Buell a letter similar to this,\r\nmeaning that he and you shall communicate and act in concert, unless it be\r\nyour judgment and his that there is no necessity for it. You and he will\r\nunderstand much better than I how to do it. Please do not lose time in\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PEOPLE OF MARYLAND,\r\n\r\nIn view of the recent declaration of the people of Maryland of their\r\nadhesion to the Union, so distinctly made in their recent election,\r\nthe President directs that all the prisoners who having heretofore\r\nbeen arrested in that State are now detained in military custody by\r\nthe President's authority, be released from their imprisonment on the\r\nfollowing conditions, namely: that if they were holding any civil or\r\nmilitary offices when arrested, the terms of which have expired, they\r\nshall not resume or reclaim such office; and secondly, all persons\r\navailing themselves of this proclamation shall engage by oath or parole of\r\nhonor to maintain the Union and the Constitution of the United States, and\r\nin no way to aid or abet by arms, counsel, conversation, or information\r\nof any kind the existing insurrection against the Government of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTo guard against misapprehension it is proper to state that this\r\nproclamation does not apply to prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 2, 1862\r\n\r\nTo THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a letter to the Secretary of State\r\nfrom James R. Partridge, secretary to the executive committee to the in\r\nexhibition to be held in London in the course present year, and a copy\r\nof the correspond which it refers, relative to a vessel for the of taking\r\nsuch articles as persons in this country may wish to exhibit on that\r\noccasion. As it appears no naval vessel can be spared for the purpose, I\r\nrecommend that authority be given to charter a suitable merchant vessel,\r\nin order that facilities similar to those afforded by the government\r\nexhibition of 1851 may also be extended to citizens of the United States\r\nwho may desire to contribute to the exhibition of this year.\r\n\r\nA.

BUELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BUELL:\r\n\r\nHave arms gone forward for East Tennessee? Please tell me the progress and\r\ncondition of the movement in that direction. Answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL D. C. BUELL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJanuary 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL BUELL.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your despatch of yesterday has been received, and it\r\ndisappoints and distresses me. I have shown it to General McClellan, who\r\nsays he will write you to-day. I am not competent to criticize your views,\r\nand therefore what I offer is in justification of myself. Of the two, I\r\nwould rather have a point on the railroad south of Cumberland Gap\r\nthan Nashville. First, because it cuts a great artery of the enemy's\r\ncommunication, which Nashville does not; and secondly, because it is in\r\nthe midst of loyal people who would rally around it, while Nashville is\r\nnot. Again, I cannot see why the movement on East Tennessee would not be\r\na diversion in your favor rather than a disadvantage, assuming that a\r\nmovement toward Nashville is the main object. But my distress is that our\r\nfriends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair, and even\r\nnow, I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal\r\nprotection. In this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the South.\r\nMy despatch, to which yours is an answer, was sent with the knowledge of\r\nSenator Johnson and Representative Maynard of East Tennessee, and they\r\nwill be upon me to know the answer, which I cannot safely show them. They\r\nwould despair, possibly resign to go and save their families somehow,\r\nor die with them. I do not intend this to be an order in any sense, but\r\nmerely, as intimated before, to show you the grounds of my anxiety.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 7, 1862.\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL D.C. BUELL, Louisville:\r\n\r\nPlease name as early a day as you safely can on or before which you can\r\nbe ready to move southward in concert with Major-General Halleck. Delay is\r\nruining us, and it is indispensable for me to have something definite. I\r\nsend a like despatch to Major-General Halleck.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 10, 1862\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a translation of an instruction to the minister of\r\nhis Majesty the Emperor of Austria accredited to this government, and a\r\ncopy of a note to that minister from the Secretary of State relative to\r\nthe questions involved in the taking from the British steamer Trent of\r\ncertain citizens of the United States by order of Captain Wilkes of the\r\nUnited States Navy. This correspondence may be considered as a sequel to\r\nthat previously communicated to Congress relating to the same subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT ON LETTER FROM GENERAL HALLECK,\r\n\r\nJANUARY 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI ST. Louis, January 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nTo His EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nIn reply to your Excellency's letter of the 1st instant, I have to state\r\nthat on receiving your telegram I immediately communicated with General\r\nBuell and have since sent him all the information I could obtain of the\r\nenemy's movements about Columbus and Camp Beauregard. No considerable\r\nforce has been sent from those places to Bowling Green. They have about\r\n22,000 men at Columbus, and the place is strongly fortified. I have at\r\nCairo, Port Holt, and Paducah only about 15,000, which, after leaving\r\nguards at these places, would give me but little over 10,000 men with\r\nwhich to assist General Buell. It would be madness to attempt anything\r\nserious with such a force, and I cannot at the present time withdraw any\r\nfrom Missouri without risking the loss of this State. The troops recently\r\nraised in other States of this department have, without my knowledge, been\r\nsent to Kentucky and Kansas.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that the authorities at Washington do not appreciate the\r\ndifficulties with which we have to contend here. The operations of Lane,\r\nJennison, and others have so enraged the people of Missouri that it is\r\nestimated that there is a majority of 80,000 against the government. We\r\nare virtually in an enemy's country. Price and others have a considerable\r\narmy in the southwest, against which I am operating with all my available\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThis city and most of the middle and northern counties are\r\ninsurrectionary,--burning bridges, destroying telegraph lines, etc.,--and\r\ncan be kept down only by the presence of troops. A large portion of the\r\nforeign troops organized by General Fremont are unreliable; indeed, many\r\nof them are already mutinous. They have been tampered with by politicians,\r\nand made to believe that if they get up a mutiny and demand Fremont's\r\nreturn the government will be forced to restore him to duty here. It\r\nis believed that some high officers are in the plot I have already been\r\nobliged to disarm several of these organizations, and I am daily expecting\r\nmore serious outbreaks. Another grave difficulty is the want of proper\r\ngeneral officers to command the troops and enforce order and discipline,\r\nand especially to protect public property from robbery and plunder.\r\nSome of the brigadier-generals assigned to this department are entirely\r\nignorant of their duties and unfit for any command. I assure you, Mr.\r\nPresident, it is very difficult to accomplish much with such means. I am\r\nin the condition of a carpenter who is required to build a bridge with\r\na dull axe, a broken saw, and rotten timber. It is true that I have some\r\nvery good green timber, which will answer the purpose as soon as I can get\r\nit into shape and season it a little.\r\n\r\nI know nothing of General Buell's intended operations, never having\r\nreceived any information in regard to the general plan of campaign. If\r\nit be intended that his column shall move on Bowling Green while another\r\nmoves from Cairo or Paducah on Columbus or Camp Beauregard, it will be a\r\nrepetition of the same strategic error which produced the disaster of Bull\r\nRun. To operate on exterior lines against an enemy occupying a central\r\nposition will fail, as it always has failed, in ninety-nine cases out of a\r\nhundred. It is condemned by every military authority I have ever read.\r\n\r\nGeneral Buell's army and the forces at Paducah occupy precisely the same\r\nposition in relation to each other and to the enemy as did the armies of\r\nMcDowell and Patterson before the battle of Bull Run.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General\r\n\r\n[Indorsement]\r\n\r\nThe within is a copy of a letter just received from General Halleck. It is\r\nexceedingly discouraging. As everywhere else, nothing can be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR ANDREW.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., January 11, 1862\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR JOHN A. ANDREW, Boston:\r\n\r\nI will be greatly obliged if you will arrange; somehow with General Butler\r\nto officer his two un-officered regiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL D. C. BUELL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 13, 1861\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL BUELL.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--Your despatch of yesterday is received, in which you say, \"I\r\nreceived your letter and General McClellan's, and will at once devote my\r\nefforts to your views and his.\" In the midst of my many cares I have not\r\nseen, nor asked to see, General McClellan's letter to you. For my own\r\nviews, I have not offered and do not now offer them as orders; and while I\r\nam glad to have them respectfully considered, I would blame you to follow\r\nthem contrary to your own clear judgment, unless I should put them in the\r\nform of orders. As to General McClellan's views, you understand your duty\r\nin regard to them better than I do.\r\n\r\nWith this preliminary I state my general idea of this war to be, that\r\nwe have the greater numbers and the enemy has the greater facility of\r\nconcentrating forces upon points of collision; that we must fail unless we\r\ncan find some way of making our advantage an overmatch for his; and that\r\nthis can only be done by menacing him with superior forces at different\r\npoints at the same time, so that we can safely attack one or both if he\r\nmakes no change; and if he weakens one to strengthen the other, forbear to\r\nattack the strengthened one, but seize and hold the weakened one, gaining\r\nso much.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: Suppose last summer, when Winchester ran away to reinforce\r\nManassas, we had forborne to attack Manassas, but had seized and held\r\nWinchester. I mention this to illustrate and not to criticise. I did not\r\nlose confidence in McDowell, and I think less harshly of Patterson than\r\nsome others seem to.... Applying the principle to your case, my idea is\r\nthat Halleck shall menace Columbus and \"down river\" generally, while you\r\nmenace Bowling Green and East Tennessee. If the enemy shall concentrate\r\nat Bowling Green, do not retire from his front, yet do not fight him there\r\neither, but seize Columbus and East Tennessee, one or both, left exposed\r\nby the concentration at Bowling Green. It is a matter of no small anxiety\r\nto me, and which I am sure you will not overlook, that the East Tennessee\r\nline is so long and over so bad a road.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n(Indorsement.)\r\n\r\nHaving to-day written General Buell a letter, it occurs to me to send\r\nGeneral Halleck a copy of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The Germans are true and patriotic and so far as they have\r\ngot cross in Missouri it is upon mistake and misunderstanding. Without a\r\nknowledge of its contents, Governor Koerner, of Illinois, will hand you\r\nthis letter. He is an educated and talented German gentleman, as true a\r\nman as lives. With his assistance you can set everything right with\r\nthe Germans.... My clear judgment is that, with reference to the German\r\nelement in your command, you should have Governor Koerner with you; and if\r\nagreeable to you and him, I will make him a brigadier-general, so that\r\nhe can afford to give his time. He does not wish to command in the field,\r\nthough he has more military knowledge than some who do. If he goes\r\ninto the place, he will simply be an efficient, zealous, and unselfish\r\nassistant to you. I say all this upon intimate personal acquaintance with\r\nGovernor Koerner.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, January 31, 1862\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--It is my wish that the expedition commonly called the\r\n\"Lane Expedition\" shall be, as much as has been promised at the\r\nadjutant-general's office, under the supervision of General McClellan, and\r\nnot any more. I have not intended, and do not now intend, that it shall be\r\na great, exhausting affair, but a snug, sober column of 10,000 or 15,000.\r\nGeneral Lane has been told by me many times that he is under the command\r\nof General Hunter, and assented to it as often as told. It was the\r\ndistinct agreement between him and me, when I appointed him, that he was\r\nto be under Hunter.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT'S SPECIAL WAR ORDER NO. 1.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 31, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That all the disposable force of the Army of the Potomac,\r\nafter providing safely for the defence of Washington, be formed into an\r\nexpedition for the immediate object of seizing and occupying a point upon\r\nthe railroad southwestward of what is known as Manassas Junction, all\r\ndetails to be in the discretion of the commander-in-chief, and the\r\nexpedition to move before or on the 22d day of February next.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPOSITION TO McCLELLAN'S PLANS\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--You and I have distinct and different plans for a movement\r\nof the Army of the Potomac--yours to be down the Chesapeake, up the\r\nRappahannock to Urbana, and across land to the terminus of the railroad on\r\nthe York River; mine to move directly to a point on the railroad southwest\r\nof Manassas.\r\n\r\nIf you will give me satisfactory answers to the following questions, I\r\nshall gladly yield my plan to yours.\r\n\r\nFirst. Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time and\r\nmoney than mine?\r\n\r\nSecond. Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine?\r\n\r\nThird. Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine?\r\n\r\nFourth. In fact, would it not be less valuable in this, that it would\r\nbreak no great line of the enemy's communications, while mine would?\r\n\r\nFifth. In case of disaster, would not a retreat be more difficult by your\r\nplan than mine?\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemorandum accompanying Letter of President Lincoln to General McClellan,\r\n\r\ndated February 3,1862.\r\n\r\nFirst. Suppose the enemy should attack us in force before we reach the\r\nOccoquan, what?\r\n\r\nSecond. Suppose the enemy in force shall dispute the crossing of the\r\nOccoquan, what? In view of this, might it not be safest for us to cross\r\nthe Occoquan at Coichester, rather than at the village of Occoquan? This\r\nwould cost the enemy two miles of travel to meet us, but would, on the\r\ncontrary, leave us two miles farther from our ultimate destination.\r\n\r\nThird. Suppose we reach Maple Valley without an attack, will we not be\r\nattacked there in force by the enemy marching by the several roads from\r\nManassas; and if so, what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WM. H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Yours of January 30th just received. Do just as you say\r\nabout the money matter.\r\n\r\nAs you well know, I have not time to write a letter of respectable length.\r\nGod bless you, says\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPITE FOR NATHANIEL GORDON\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\r\nTo all to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting:\r\n\r\nWhereas it appears that at a term of the Circuit Court of the United\r\nStates of America for the Southern District of New York held in the month\r\nof November, A.D. 1861, Nathaniel Gordon was indicted and convicted for\r\nbeing engaged in the slave trade, and was by the said court sentenced to\r\nbe put to death by hanging by the neck, on Friday the 7th day of February,\r\nAD. 1862:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas a large number of respectable citizens have earnestly besought\r\nme to commute the said sentence of the said Nathaniel Gordon to a term of\r\nimprisonment for life, which application I have felt it to be my duty to\r\nrefuse:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas it has seemed to me probable that the unsuccessful application\r\nmade for the commutation of his sentence may have prevented the said\r\nNathaniel Gordon from making the necessary preparation for the awful\r\nchange which awaits him;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known, that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States of America, have granted and do hereby grant unto him, the\r\nsaid Nathaniel Gordon, a respite of the above recited sentence, until\r\nFriday the twenty-first day of February, A.D. 1862, between the hours of\r\ntwelve o'clock at noon and three o'clock in the afternoon of the said day,\r\nwhen the said sentence shall be executed.\r\n\r\nIn granting this respite, it becomes my painful duty to admonish the\r\nprisoner that, relinquishing all expectation of pardon by human authority,\r\nhe refer himself alone to the mercy of the common God and Father of all\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto signed my name and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the City of Washington, this fourth day of February, A.D. 1862,\r\nand of the independence of the United States the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, February 4. 1862\r\n\r\nTo THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved December 21, 1862, provides:\r\n\r\n\"That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the retired\r\nlist of the navy for the command of squadrons and single ships such\r\nofficers as he may believe that the good of the service requires to be\r\nthus placed in command; and such officers may, if upon the recommendation\r\nof the President of the United States they shall receive a vote of thanks\r\nof Congress for their services and gallantry in action against an enemy,\r\nbe restored to the active list, and not otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, Captain Samuel F. Du Pont, of the navy, was\r\nnominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command of\r\nthe squadron which recently rendered such important service to the Union\r\nin the expedition to the coast of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law, or be more pregnant with happy influence as\r\nan example, I cordially recommend that Captain Samuel F. Du Pont receive a\r\nvote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry displayed in the\r\ncapture of Forts Walker and Beauregard, commanding the entrance of Port\r\nRoyal Harbor, on the 7th of November, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERALS D. HUNTER AND J. H. LANE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, FEBRUARY 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER AND BRIGADIER-GENERAL LANE, Leavenworth, Kansas:\r\n\r\nMy wish has been and is to avail the government of the services of both\r\nGeneral Hunter and General Lane, and, so far as possible, to personally\r\noblige both. General Hunter is the senior officer, and must command when\r\nthey serve together; though in so far as he can consistently with the\r\npublic service and his own honor oblige General Lane, he will also oblige\r\nme. If they cannot come to an amicable understanding, General Lane must\r\nreport to General Hunter for duty, according to the rules, or decline the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 1, RELATING TO POLITICAL PRISONERS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, February 14,1862.\r\n\r\nThe breaking out of a formidable insurrection based on a conflict of\r\npolitical ideas, being an event without precedent in the United States,\r\nwas necessarily attended by great confusion and perplexity of the public\r\nmind. Disloyalty before unsuspected suddenly became bold, and treason\r\nastonished the world by bringing at once into the field military forces\r\nsuperior in number to the standing army of the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery department of the government was paralyzed by treason. Defection\r\nappeared in the Senate, in the House of Representatives, in the Cabinet,\r\nin the Federal courts; ministers and consuls returned from foreign\r\ncountries to enter the insurrectionary councils of land or naval forces;\r\ncommanding and other officers of the army and in the navy betrayed our\r\ncouncils or deserted their posts for commands in the insurgent forces.\r\nTreason was flagrant in the revenue and in the post-office service, as\r\nwell as in the Territorial governments and in the Indian reserves.\r\n\r\nNot only governors, judges, legislators, and ministerial officers in\r\nthe States, but even whole States rushed one after another with apparent\r\nunanimity into rebellion. The capital was besieged and its connection with\r\nall the States cut off. Even in the portions of the country which were\r\nmost loyal, political combinations and secret societies were formed\r\nfurthering the work of disunion, while, from motives of disloyalty or\r\ncupidity or from excited passions or perverted sympathies, individuals\r\nwere found furnishing men, money, and materials of war and supplies to the\r\ninsurgents' military and naval forces. Armies, ships, fortifications,\r\nnavy yards, arsenals, military posts, and garrisons one after another were\r\nbetrayed or abandoned to the insurgents.\r\n\r\nCongress had not anticipated, and so had not provided for, the emergency.\r\nThe municipal authorities were powerless and inactive. The judicial\r\nmachinery seemed as if it had been designed, not to sustain the\r\ngovernment, but to embarrass and betray it.\r\n\r\nForeign intervention, openly invited and industriously instigated by the\r\nabettors of the insurrection, became imminent, and has only been prevented\r\nby the practice of strict and impartial justice, with the most perfect\r\nmoderation, in our intercourse with nations.\r\n\r\nThe public mind was alarmed and apprehensive, though fortunately not\r\ndistracted or disheartened. It seemed to be doubtful whether the Federal\r\nGovernment, which one year before had been thought a model worthy of\r\nuniversal acceptance, had indeed the ability to defend and maintain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nSome reverses, which, perhaps, were unavoidable, suffered by newly levied\r\nand inefficient forces, discouraged the loyal and gave new hopes to the\r\ninsurgents. Voluntary enlistments seemed about to cease and desertions\r\ncommenced. Parties speculated upon the question whether conscription had\r\nnot become necessary to fill up the armies of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency the President felt it his duty to employ with energy the\r\nextraordinary powers which the Constitution confides to him in cases of\r\ninsurrection. He called into the field such military and naval forces,\r\nunauthorized by the existing laws, as seemed necessary. He directed\r\nmeasures to prevent the use of the post-office for treasonable\r\ncorrespondence. He subjected passengers to and from foreign countries to\r\nnew passport regulations, and he instituted a blockade, suspended the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus in various places, and caused persons who were\r\nrepresented to him as being or about to engage in disloyal and treasonable\r\npractices to be arrested by special civil as well as military agencies\r\nand detained in military custody when necessary to prevent them and deter\r\nothers from such practices. Examinations of such cases were instituted,\r\nand some of the persons so arrested have been discharged from time to time\r\nunder circumstances or upon conditions compatible, as was thought, with\r\nthe public safety.\r\n\r\nMeantime a favorable change of public opinion has occurred. The line\r\nbetween loyalty and disloyalty is plainly defined. The whole structure\r\nof the government is firm and stable. Apprehension of public danger and\r\nfacilities for treasonable practices have diminished with the passions\r\nwhich prompted heedless persons to adopt them. The insurrection is\r\nbelieved to have culminated and to be declining.\r\n\r\nThe President, in view of these facts, and anxious to favor a return to\r\nthe normal course of the administration as far as regard for the public\r\nwelfare will allow, directs that all political prisoners or state\r\nprisoners now held in military custody be released on their subscribing\r\nto a parole engaging them to render no aid or comfort to the enemies in\r\nhostility to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War will, however, in his discretion, except from the\r\neffect of this order any persons detained as spies in the service of the\r\ninsurgents, or others whose release at the present moment may be deemed\r\nincompatible with the public safety.\r\n\r\nTo all persons who shall be so released, and who shall keep their parole,\r\nthe President grants an amnesty for any past offences of treason or\r\ndisloyalty which they may have comminuted.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary arrests will hereafter be made under the direction of the\r\nmilitary authorities alone.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. WASHINGTON CITY, February 15, 1862\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved December 21, 1861, provides\r\n\r\n\"That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the retired\r\nlist of the navy for the command of squadrons and single ships such\r\nofficers as he may believe that the good of the service requires to be\r\nthus placed in command; and such officers may, if upon the recommendation\r\nof the President of the United States they shall receive a vote of thanks\r\nof Congress for their services and gallantry in action against an enemy,\r\nbe restored to the active list, and not otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, Captain Louis M. Goldsborough, of the navy,\r\nwas nominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command\r\nof the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, which recently rendered such\r\nimportant service to the Union in the expedition to the coast of North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence\r\nas an example, I cordially recommend that Captain Louis M. Goldsborough\r\nreceive a vote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry\r\ndisplayed in the combined attack of the forces commanded by him and\r\nBrigadier-General Burnside in the capture of Roanoke Island and the\r\ndestruction of rebel gunboats On the 7th, 8th, and 10th of February, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST WRITTEN NOTICE OF GRANT\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nFebruary 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nYou have Fort Donelson safe, unless Grant shall be overwhelmed from\r\noutside; to prevent which latter will, I think, require all the vigilance,\r\nenergy, and skill of yourself and Buell, acting in full co-operation.\r\nColumbus will not get at Grant, but the force from Bowling Green will.\r\nThey hold the railroad from Bowling Green to within a few miles of Fort\r\nDonelson, with the bridge at Clarksville undisturbed. It is unsafe to\r\nrely that they will not dare to expose Nashville to Buell. A small part of\r\ntheir force can retire slowly toward Nashville, breaking up the railroad\r\nas they go, and keep Buell out of that city twenty days. Meanwhile\r\nNashville will be abundantly defended by forces from all South and perhaps\r\nfrom hers at Manassas. Could not a cavalry force from General Thomas on\r\nthe upper Cumberland dash across, almost unresisted, and cut the railroad\r\nat or near Knoxville, Tennessee? In the midst of a bombardment at Fort\r\nDonelson, why could not a gunboat run up and destroy the bridge at\r\nClarksville? Our success or failure at Fort Donelson is vastly important,\r\nand I beg you to put your soul in the effort. I send a copy of this to\r\nBuell.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 2.--IN RELATION TO STATE PRISONERS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, FEBRUARY 27, 1862\r\n\r\nIt is ordered:\r\n\r\nFirst. That a special commission of two persons, one of military rank and\r\nthe other in civil life, be appointed to examine the cases of the state\r\nprisoners remaining in the military custody of the United States, and to\r\ndetermine whether in view of the public Safety and the existing rebellion\r\nthey should be discharged, or remain in military custody, or be remitted\r\nto the civil tribunals for trial.\r\n\r\nSecond. That Major-General John A. Dix, commanding in Baltimore, and the\r\nHON. Edwards Pierrepont, of New York, be, and they are hereby, appointed\r\ncommissioners for the purpose above mentioned; and they are authorized to\r\nexamine, hear, and determine the cases aforesaid ex parte and in a summary\r\nmanner, at such times and places as in their discretion they may appoint,\r\nand make full report to the War Department.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER RELATING TO COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the existing circumstances of the country allow a partial\r\nrestoration of commercial intercourse between the inhabitants of those\r\nparts of the United States heretofore declared to be in insurrection\r\nand the citizens of the loyal States of the Union, and exercising the\r\nauthority and discretion confided to me by the act of Congress, approved\r\nJuly 13, 1861, entitled \"An act further to provide for the collection of\r\nduties on imports, and for other purposes,\" I hereby license and permit\r\nsuch commercial intercourse in all cases within the rules and regulations\r\nwhich have been or may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for\r\nconducting and carrying on the same on the inland waters and ways of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 28, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH TO THE PERUVIAN MINISTER,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., MARCH 4, 1862\r\n\r\nThe United States have no enmities, animosities, or rivalries, and no\r\ninterests which conflict with the welfare, safety, and rights or interests\r\nof any other nation. Their own prosperity, happiness, and aggrandizement\r\nare sought most safely and advantageously through the preservation not\r\nonly of peace on their own part, but peace among all other nations. But\r\nwhile the United States are thus a friend to all other nations, they do\r\nnot seek to conceal the fact that they cherish especial sentiments of\r\nfriendship for, and sympathies with, those who, like themselves, have\r\nfounded their institutions on the principle of the equal rights of men;\r\nand such nations being more prominently neighbors of the United States,\r\nthe latter are co-operating with them in establishing civilization and\r\nculture on the American continent. Such being the general principles which\r\ngovern the United States in their foreign relations, you may be assured,\r\nsir, that in all things this government will deal justly, frankly, and, if\r\nit be possible, even liberally with Peru, whose liberal sentiments toward\r\nus you have so kindly expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS RECOMMENDING COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\nMarch 6, 1862\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:--I recommend\r\nthe adoption of a joint resolution by your honorable bodies which shall be\r\nsubstantially as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State which\r\nmay adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary\r\naid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to compensate for the\r\ninconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of system.\"\r\n\r\nIf the proposition contained in the resolution does not meet the approval\r\nof Congress and the country, there is the end; but if it does command such\r\napproval, I deem it of importance that the States and people immediately\r\ninterested should be at once distinctly notified of the fact, so that\r\nthey may begin to consider whether to accept or reject it. The Federal\r\nGovernment would find its highest interest in such a measure, as one of\r\nthe most efficient means of self-preservation. The leaders of the existing\r\ninsurrection entertain the hope that this government will ultimately be\r\nforced to acknowledge the independence of some part of the disaffected\r\nregion, and that all the slave States north of such part will then say,\r\n\"The Union for which we have struggled being already gone, we now\r\nchoose to go with the Southern section.\" To deprive them of this hope\r\nsubstantially ends the rebellion, and the initiation of emancipation\r\ncompletely deprives them of it as to all the States initiating it. The\r\npoint is not that all the States tolerating slavery would very soon, if at\r\nall, initiate emancipation; but that, while the offer is equally made to\r\nall, the more northern shall by such initiation make it certain to the\r\nmore southern that in no event will the former ever join the latter in\r\ntheir proposed confederacy. I say \"initiation\" because, in my judgment,\r\ngradual and not sudden emancipation is better for all. In the mere\r\nfinancial or pecuniary view, any member of Congress with the census tables\r\nand treasury reports before him can readily see for himself how very soon\r\nthe current expenditures of this war would purchase, at fair valuation,\r\nall the slaves in any named State. Such a proposition on the part of the\r\nGeneral Government sets up no claim of a right by Federal authority to\r\ninterfere with slavery within State limits, referring, as it does, the\r\nabsolute control of the subject in each case to the State and its people\r\nimmediately interested. It is proposed as a matter of perfectly free\r\nchoice with them.\r\n\r\nIn the annual message last December, I thought fit to say, \"The Union must\r\nbe preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed.\" I said\r\nthis not hastily, but deliberately. War has been made and continues to be\r\nan indispensable means to this end. A practical reacknowledgment of the\r\nnational authority would render the war unnecessary, and it would at once\r\ncease. If, however, resistance continues, the war must also continue; and\r\nit is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend and all the\r\nruin which may follow it. Such as may seem indispensable or may obviously\r\npromise great efficiency toward ending the struggle must and will come.\r\n\r\nThe proposition now made (though an offer only), I hope it may be esteemed\r\nno offense to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered would not\r\nbe of more value to the States and private persons concerned than are the\r\ninstitution and property in it in the present aspect of affairs.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would\r\nbe merely initiatory, and not within itself a practical measure, it is\r\nrecommended in the hope that it would soon lead to important practical\r\nresults. In full view of my great responsibility to my God and to my\r\ncountry, I earnestly beg the attention of Congress and the people to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT ON LETTER FROM GOVERNOR YATES.\r\n\r\nSTATE OF ILLINOIS, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, SPRINGFIELD, ILL., March 1, 1862\r\n\r\nHON. EDWIN M. STANTON, SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The government at my special request a few months since contracted\r\nfor fourteen batteries of the James rifled gun, 6-pounder calibre, and a\r\nlimited quantity of the James projectiles, weighing about fourteen pounds\r\neach. The reports showing the superiority of this gun and projectile, both\r\nas regards range, accuracy, and execution, for field service over that of\r\nall others at the battle of Fort Donelson, leads me to request that there\r\nbe furnished to the State of Illinois in the shortest time practicable\r\nseven batteries of 12-pounder calibre James rifled guns, with carriages,\r\nharness, implements, etc., complete and ready for field service, together\r\nwith the following fixed ammunition to each gun, viz., 225 shells, 225\r\ncanister, and 50 solid projectiles, weighing about 24 pounds each, and\r\nalso 200 shells, 100 canister, and 100 solid projectiles for each of the\r\nguns of the fourteen batteries named above, weighing about 14 pounds each,\r\nall to be of the James model.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nRICHARD YATES, Governor of Illinois.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nMarch 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe within is from the Governor of Illinois. I understand the seven\r\nadditional batteries now sought are to be 6-gun batteries, and the object\r\nis to mix them with the fourteen batteries they already have so as to make\r\neach battery consist of four 6-pounders and two 12-pounders. I shall be\r\nvery glad to have the requisition filled if it can be without detriment to\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT'S GENERAL WAR ORDER NO.2.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nMarch 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered: 1.

LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND SOME BORDER SLAVE STATE\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATIVES, BY HON. J. W. CRISFIELD.\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR:--I called, at the request of the President, to ask you to come\r\nto the White House tomorrow morning, at nine o'clock, and bring such of\r\nyour colleagues as are in town.\"\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nYesterday, on my return from church, I found Mr. Postmaster-General Blair\r\nin my room, writing the above note, which he immediately suspended, and\r\nverbally communicated the President's invitation, and stated that the\r\nPresident's purpose was to have some conversation with the delegations of\r\nKentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, in explanation of\r\nhis message of the 6th instant.\r\n\r\nThis morning these delegations, or such of them as were in town, assembled\r\nat the White House at the appointed time, and after some little delay were\r\nadmitted to an audience. Mr. Leary and myself were the only members from\r\nMaryland present, and, I think, were the only members of the delegation at\r\nthat time in the city. I know that Mr. Pearoe, of the Senate, and Messrs.\r\nWebster and Calvert, of the House, were absent.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual salutations, and we were seated, the President said, in\r\nsubstance, that he had invited us to meet him to have some conversation\r\nwith us in explanation of his message of the 6th; that since he had sent\r\nit in several of the gentlemen then present had visited him, but had\r\navoided any allusion to the message, and he therefore inferred that the\r\nimport of the message had been misunderstood, and was regarded as inimical\r\nto the interests we represented; and he had resolved he would talk with\r\nus, and disabuse our minds of that erroneous opinion.\r\n\r\nThe President then disclaimed any intent to injure the interests or wound\r\nthe sensibilities of the slave States. On the contrary, his purpose was to\r\nprotect the one and respect the other; that we were engaged in a terrible,\r\nwasting, and tedious war; immense armies were in the field, and must\r\ncontinue in the field as long as the war lasts; that these armies must,\r\nof necessity, be brought into contact with slaves in the States we\r\nrepresented and in other States as they advanced; that slaves would come\r\nto the camps, and continual irritation was kept up; that he was constantly\r\nannoyed by conflicting and antagonistic complaints: on the one side a\r\ncertain class complained if the slave was not protected by the army;\r\npersons were frequently found who, participating in these views, acted\r\nin a way unfriendly to the slaveholder; on the other hand, slaveholders\r\ncomplained that their rights were interfered with, their slaves induced\r\nto abscond and protected within the lines; these complaints were numerous,\r\nloud and deep; were a serious annoyance to him and embarrassing to the\r\nprogress of the war; that it kept alive a spirit hostile to the government\r\nin the States we represented; strengthened the hopes of the Confederates\r\nthat at some day the border States would unite with them, and thus tend\r\nto prolong the war; and he was of opinion, if this resolution should be\r\nadopted by Congress and accepted by our States, these causes of irritation\r\nand these hopes would be removed, and more would be accomplished toward\r\nshortening the war than could be hoped from the greatest victory achieved\r\nby Union armies; that he made this proposition in good faith, and desired\r\nit to be accepted, if at all, voluntarily, and in the same patriotic\r\nspirit in which it was made; that emancipation was a subject exclusively\r\nunder the control of the States, and must be adopted or rejected by each\r\nfor itself; that he did not claim nor had this government any right to\r\ncoerce them for that purpose; that such was no part of his purpose in\r\nmaking this proposition, and he wished it to be clearly understood; that\r\nhe did not expect us there to be prepared to give him an answer, but he\r\nhoped we would take the subject into serious consideration, confer\r\nwith one another, and then take such course as we felt our duty and the\r\ninterests of our constituents required of us.\r\n\r\nMr. Noell, of Missouri, said that in his State slavery was not considered\r\na permanent institution; that natural causes were there in operation which\r\nwould at no distant day extinguish it, and he did not think that this\r\nproposition was necessary for that; and, besides that, he and his\r\nfriends felt solicitous as to the message on account of the different\r\nconstructions which the resolution and message had received. The New York\r\nTribune was for it, and understood it to mean that we must accept gradual\r\nemancipation according to the plan suggested, or get something worse.\r\n\r\nThe President replied that he must not be expected to quarrel with the New\r\nYork Tribune before the right time; he hoped never to have to do it; he\r\nwould not anticipate events. In respect to emancipation in Missouri, he\r\nsaid that what had been observed by Mr. Noell was probably true, but the\r\noperation of these natural causes had not prevented the irritating conduct\r\nto which he had referred, or destroyed the hopes of the Confederates that\r\nMissouri would at some time merge herself alongside of them, which, in his\r\njudgment, the passage of this resolution by Congress and its acceptance by\r\nMissouri would accomplish.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisfield, of Maryland, asked what would be the effect of the refusal\r\nof the State to accept this proposal, and he desired to know if the\r\nPresident looked to any policy beyond the acceptance or rejection of this\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nThe President replied that he had no designs beyond the actions of the\r\nStates on this particular subject. He should lament their refusal to\r\naccept it, but he had no designs beyond their refusal of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Menzies, of Kentucky, inquired if the President thought there was\r\nany power except in the States themselves to carry out his scheme of\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nThe President replied that he thought there could not be. He then went\r\noff into a course of remarks not qualifying the foregoing declaration nor\r\nmaterial to be repeated to a just understanding of his meaning.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisfield said he did not think the people of Maryland looked upon\r\nslavery as a permanent institution; and he did not know that they would\r\nbe very reluctant to give it up if provision was made to meet the loss and\r\nthey could be rid of the race; but they did not like to be coerced\r\ninto emancipation, either by the direct action of the government or by\r\nindirection, as through the emancipation of slaves in this District, or\r\nthe confiscation of Southern property as now threatened; and he thought\r\nbefore they would consent to consider this proposition they would require\r\nto be informed on these points. The President replied that, unless he was\r\nexpelled by the act of God or the Confederate armies he should occupy\r\nthat house for three years; and as long as he remained there Maryland had\r\nnothing to fear either for her institutions or her interests on the points\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisfield immediately added: \"Mr. President, if what you now say could\r\nbe heard by the people of Maryland, they would consider your proposition\r\nwith a much better feeling than I fear without it they will be inclined to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nThe President: \"That [meaning a publication of what he said] will not\r\ndo; it would force me into a quarrel before the proper time \"; and,\r\nagain intimating, as he had before done, that a quarrel with the \"Greeley\r\nfaction\" was impending, he said he did not wish to encounter it before the\r\nproper time, nor at all if it could be avoided.\r\n\r\n[The Greely faction wanted an immediate Emancipation Proclamation. D.W.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Wickliffe, of Kentucky, then asked him respecting the\r\nconstitutionality of his scheme.\r\n\r\nThe President replied: \"As you may suppose, I have considered that;\r\nand the proposition now submitted does not encounter any constitutional\r\ndifficulty. It proposes simply to co-operate with any State by giving such\r\nState pecuniary aid\"; and he thought that the resolution, as proposed by\r\nhim, would be considered rather as the expression of a sentiment than as\r\ninvolving any constitutional question.\r\n\r\nMr. Hall, of Missouri, thought that if this proposition was adopted at all\r\nit should be by the votes of the free States, and come as a proposition\r\nfrom them to the slave States, affording them an inducement to put aside\r\nthis subject of discord; that it ought not to be expected that members\r\nrepresenting slaveholding constituencies should declare at once, and in\r\nadvance of any proposition to them, for the emancipation of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe President said he saw and felt the force of the objection; it was a\r\nfearful responsibility, and every gentleman must do as he thought best;\r\nthat he did not know how this scheme was received by the members from the\r\nfree States; some of them had spoken to him and received it kindly; but\r\nfor the most part they were as reserved and chary as we had been, and he\r\ncould not tell how they would vote. And in reply to some expression of Mr.\r\nHall as to his own opinion regarding slavery, he said he did not pretend\r\nto disguise his anti-slavery feeling; that he thought it was wrong, and\r\nshould continue to think so; but that was not the question we had to deal\r\nwith now. Slavery existed, and that, too, as well by the act of the North\r\nas of the South; and in any scheme to get rid of it the North as well as\r\nthe South was morally bound to do its full and equal share. He thought the\r\ninstitution wrong and ought never to have existed; but yet he recognized\r\nthe rights of property which had grown out of it, and would respect those\r\nrights as fully as similar rights in any other property; that property can\r\nexist and does legally exist. He thought such a law wrong, but the rights\r\nof property resulting must be respected; he would get rid of the odious\r\nlaw, not by violating the rights, but by encouraging the proposition and\r\noffering inducements to give it up.\r\n\r\nHere the interview, so far as this subject is concerned, terminated by\r\nMr. Crittenden's assuring the President that, whatever might be our final\r\naction, we all thought him solely moved by a high patriotism and sincere\r\ndevotion to the happiness and glory of his country; and with that\r\nconviction we should consider respectfully the important suggestions he\r\nhad made.\r\n\r\nAfter some conversation on the current war news, we retired, and\r\nI immediately proceeded to my room and wrote out this paper. J. W.\r\nCRISFIELD.\r\n\r\nWe were present at the interview described in the foregoing paper of\r\nMr. Crisfield, and we certify that the substance of what passed on the\r\noccasion is in this paper faithfully and fully given.\r\n\r\nJ. W. MENZIES, J. J. CRITTENDEN, R. MALLORY.\r\n\r\nMarch 10, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT'S SPECIAL WAR ORDER NO.3.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nMajor-General McClellan having personally taken the field at the head of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac, until otherwise ordered he is relieved from the\r\ncommand of the other military departments, he retaining command of the\r\nDepartment of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nOrdered further, That the departments now under the respective commands of\r\nGenerals Halleck and Hunter, together with so much of that under General\r\nBuell as lies west of a north and south line indefinitely drawn through\r\nKnoxville, Tenn., be consolidated and designated the Department of the\r\nMississippi, and that until otherwise ordered Major General Halleck have\r\ncommand of said department.\r\n\r\nOrdered also, That the country west of the Department of the Potomac and\r\neast of the Department of the Mississippi be a military department, to\r\nbe called the Mountain Department, and that the same be commanded by\r\nMajor-General Fremont.\r\n\r\nThat all the commanders of departments, after the receipt of this order by\r\nthem, respectively report severally and directly to the Secretary of War,\r\nand that prompt, full, and frequent reports will be expected of all and\r\neach of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL MCCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, March 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nThe President, having considered the plan of operations agreed upon by\r\nyourself and the commanders of army corps, makes no objection to the same\r\nbut gives the following directions as to its execution:\r\n\r\n1. Leave such force at Manassas Junction as shall make it entirely certain\r\nthat the enemy shall no repossess himself of that position and line of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n2. Leave Washington entirely secure.\r\n\r\n3. Move the remainder of the force down the Potomac, choosing a new base\r\nat Fortress Monroe or anywhere between here and there, or, at all events,\r\nmove such remainder of the army at once in pursuit of the enemy by some\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nEDWARD M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH TO A PARTY OF MASSACHUSETTS GENTLEMAN\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MARCH 13, 1862\r\n\r\nI thank you, Mr. Train, for your kindness in presenting me with this truly\r\nelegant and highly creditable specimen of the handiwork of the mechanics\r\nof your State of Massachusetts, and I beg of you to express my hearty\r\nthanks to the donors. It displays a perfection of workmanship which I\r\nreally wish I had time to acknowledge in more fitting words, and I might\r\nthen follow your idea that it is suggestive, for it is evidently expected\r\nthat a good deal of whipping is to be done. But as we meet here socially\r\nlet us not think only of whipping rebels, or of those who seem to think\r\nonly of whipping negroes, but of those pleasant days, which it is to be\r\nhoped are in store for us, when seated behind a good pair of horses we can\r\ncrack our whips and drive through a peaceful, happy, and prosperous land.\r\nWith this idea, gentlemen, I must leave you for my business duties. [It\r\nwas likely a Buggy-Whip D.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, March 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nThe third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved December 21, 1861, provides:\r\n\r\n\"That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the retired\r\nlist of the navy for the command of squadrons and single ships such\r\nofficers as he may believe the good of the service requires to be thus\r\nplaced in command; and such officers may, if upon the recommendation of\r\nthe President of the United States they shall receive a vote of thanks cf\r\nCongress for their services and gallantry in action against an enemy, be\r\nrestored to the active list, and not otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, Captain Samuel F. Du Pont, of the navy, was\r\nnominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command of\r\nthe squadron which recently rendered such important service to the Union\r\nin the expedition to the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence as\r\nan example, I cordially recommend that Captain Samuel F. Du Pont receive a\r\nvote of thanks of Congress for his service and gallantry displayed in the\r\ncapture since the 21st December, 1861, of various ports on the coasts of\r\nGeorgia and Florida, particularly Brunswick, Cumberland Island and Sound,\r\nAmelia Island, the towns of St. Mary's, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville\r\nand Fernandina.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, MARCH 31, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:-This morning I felt constrained to order Blenker's division\r\nto Fremont, and I write this to assure you I did so with great pain,\r\nunderstanding that you would wish it otherwise. If you could know the\r\nfull pressure of the case, I am confident that you would justify it, even\r\nbeyond a mere acknowledgment that the commander-in-chief may order what he\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIFT OF SOME RABBITS\r\n\r\nTO MICHAEL CROCK. 360 N. Fourth St., Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:-Allow me to thank you in behalf of my little son for your\r\npresent of white rabbits. He is very much pleased with them.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTION TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, April 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War will order that one or the other of the corps of\r\nGeneral McDowell and General Sumner remain in front of Washington until\r\nfurther orders from the department, to operate at or in the direction of\r\nManassas Junction, or otherwise, as occasion may require; that the other\r\nCorps not so ordered to remain go forward to General McClellan as speedily\r\nas possible; that General McClellan commence his forward movements from\r\nhis new base at once, and that such incidental modifications as the\r\nforegoing may render proper be also made. A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours of 11 A. M. today received. Secretary of War informs me that the\r\nforwarding of transportation, ammunition, and Woodbury's brigade, under\r\nyour orders, is not, and will not be, interfered with. You now have\r\nover one hundred thousand troops with you, independent of General Wool's\r\ncommand. I think you better break the enemy's line from Yorktown to\r\nWarwick River at once. This will probably use time as advantageously as\r\nyou can.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 9, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR+--Your despatches, complaining that you are not properly\r\nsustained, while they do not offend me, do pain me very much.\r\n\r\nBlenker's division was withdrawn from you before you left here, and you\r\nknew the pressure under which I did it, and, as I thought, acquiesced in\r\nit certainly not without reluctance.\r\n\r\nAfter you left I ascertained that less than 20,000 unorganized men,\r\nwithout a single field battery, were all you designed to be left for the\r\ndefense of Washington and Manassas Junction, and part of this even to go\r\nto General Hooker's old position; General Banks's corps, once designed for\r\nManassas Junction, was divided and tied up on the line of Winchester and\r\nStrasburg, and could not leave it without again exposing the upper Potomac\r\nand the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This presented (or would present when\r\nMcDowell and Sumner should be gone) a great temptation to the enemy to\r\nturn back from the Rappahannock and sack Washington. My explicit order\r\nthat Washington should, by the judgment of all the Commanders of corps, be\r\nleft entirely secure, had been neglected. It was precisely this that drove\r\nme to detain McDowell.\r\n\r\nI do not forget that I was satisfied with your arrangement to leave Banks\r\nat Manassas Junction; but when that arrangement was broken up and nothing\r\nsubstituted for it, of course I was not satisfied. I was constrained to\r\nsubstitute something for it myself.\r\n\r\nAnd now allow me to ask, do you really think I should permit the line from\r\nRichmond via Manaasas Junction to this city to be entirely open, except\r\nwhat resistance could be presented by less than 20,000 unorganized troops?\r\nThis is a question which the country will not allow me to evade.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious mystery about the number of the troops now with you.\r\nWhen I telegraphed you on the 6th, saying you had over 100,000 with you, I\r\nhad just obtained from the Secretary of War a statement, taken as he said\r\nfrom your own returns, making 108,000 then with you and en route to you.\r\nYou now say you will have but 85,000 when all enroute to you shall have\r\nreached you. How can this discrepancy of 23,000 be accounted for?\r\n\r\nAs to General Wool's command, I understand it is doing for you precisely\r\nwhat a like number of your own would have to do if that command was away.\r\nI suppose the whole force which has gone forward to you is with you by\r\nthis time; and if so, I think it is the precise time for you to strike a\r\nblow. By delay the enemy will relatively gain upon you--that is, he\r\nwill gain faster by fortifications and reinforcements than you can by\r\nreinforcements alone.\r\n\r\nAnd once more let me tell you it is indispensable to you that you strike a\r\nblow. I am powerless to help this. You will do me the justice to remember\r\nI always insisted that going down the bay in search of a field, instead\r\nof fighting at or near Manassas, was only shifting and not surmounting\r\na difficulty; that we would find the same enemy and the same or equal\r\nentrenchments at either place. The country will not fail to note--is\r\nnoting now--that the present hesitation to move upon an entrenched enemy\r\nis but the story of Manassas repeated.\r\n\r\nI beg to assure you that I have never written you or spoken to you in\r\ngreater kindness of feeling than now, nor with a fuller purpose to sustain\r\nyou, so far as in my most anxious judgment I consistently can; but you\r\nmust act.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Saint Louis, Mo.: If the rigor of the confinement\r\nof Magoffin (Governor of Kentucky) at Alton is endangering his life, or\r\nmaterially impairing his health, I wish it mitigated as far as it can be\r\nconsistently with his safe detention.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nPlease send above, by order of the President. JOHN HAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION RECOMMENDING THANKSGIVING FOR VICTORIES,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nIt has pleased Almighty God to vouchsafe signal victories to the land and\r\nnaval forces engaged in suppressing, an internal rebellion, and at the\r\nsame time to avert from our country the dangers of foreign intervention\r\nand invasion.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore recommended to the people of the United States that at\r\ntheir next weekly assemblages in their accustomed places of public worship\r\nwhich shall occur after notice of this proclamation shall have been\r\nreceived, they especially acknowledge and render thanks to our Heavenly\r\nFather for these inestimable blessings, that they then and there implore\r\nspiritual consolation in behalf of all who have been brought into\r\naffliction by the casualties and calamities of sedition and civil war, and\r\nthat they reverently invoke the divine guidance for our national counsels,\r\nto the end that they may speedily result in the restoration of peace,\r\nharmony, and unity throughout our borders and hasten the establishment of\r\nfraternal relations among all the countries of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this tenth day of April, A.D. 1862, and of\r\nthe independence of the United States the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

April 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: The act\r\nentitled \"An act for the relief of certain persons held to service or\r\nlabor in the District of Columbia\" has this day been approved and signed.\r\n\r\nI have never doubted the constitutional authority of Congress to abolish\r\nslavery in this District, and I have ever desired to see the national\r\ncapital freed from the institution in some satisfactory way. Hence there\r\nhas never been in my mind any question on the subject except the one of\r\nexpediency, arising in view of all the circumstances. If there be matters\r\nwithin and about this act which might have taken a course or shape more\r\nsatisfactory to my judgment, I do not attempt to specify them. I am\r\ngratified that the two principles of compensation and colonization are\r\nboth recognized and practically applied in the act.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of compensation, it is provided that claims may be presented\r\nwithin ninety days from the passage of the act, \"but not thereafter\"; and\r\nthere is no saving for minors, femmes covert, insane or absent persons. I\r\npresume this is an omission by mere oversight, and I recommend that it be\r\nsupplied by an amendatory or supplemental act.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of the 19th was received that day. Fredericksburg is\r\nevacuated and the bridges destroyed by the enemy, and a small part of\r\nMcDowell's command occupies this side of the Rappahannock, opposite the\r\ntown. He purposes moving his whole force to that point.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO POSTMASTER-GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nHon. POSTMASTER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The member of Congress from the district including Tiffin,\r\nO., calls on me about the postmaster at that place. I believe I turned\r\nover a despatch to you from some persons there, asking a suspension, so\r\nas for them to be heard, or something of the sort. If nothing, or nothing\r\namounting to anything, has been done, I think the suspension might now be\r\nsuspended, and the commission go forward.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 29, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nWould it derange or embarrass your operations if I were to appoint Captain\r\nCharles Griffin a brigadier-general of volunteers? Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE, MAY 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate [of April 22] in relation to\r\nBrigadier-General Stone, I have the honor to state that he was arrested\r\nand imprisoned under my general authority, and upon evidence which whether\r\nhe be guilty or innocent, required, as appears to me, such proceedings to\r\nbe had against him for the public safety. I deem it incompatible with the\r\npublic interest, as also, perhaps, unjust to General Stone, to make a more\r\nparticular statement of the evidence.\r\n\r\nHe has not been tried because, in the state of military operations at the\r\ntime of his arrest and since, the officers to constitute a court martial\r\nand for witnesses could not be withdrawn from duty without serious injury\r\nto the service. He will be allowed a trial without any unnecessary delay;\r\nthe charges and specifications will be furnished him in due season, and\r\nevery facility for his defense will be afforded him by the War Department.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour call for Parrott guns from Washington alarms me, chiefly because it\r\nargues indefinite procrastination. Is anything to be done?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, MAY 1, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Pittsburgh Landing, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nI am pressed by the Missouri members of Congress to give General Schofield\r\nindependent command in Missouri. They insist that for want of this their\r\nlocal troubles gradually grow worse. I have forborne, so far, for fear of\r\ninterfering with and embarrassing your operations. Please answer telling\r\nme whether anything, and what, I can do for them without injuriously\r\ninterfering with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO EVANGELICAL LUTHERANS, MAY 6, 1862\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--I welcome here the representatives of the Evangelical\r\nLutherans of the United States. I accept with gratitude their assurances\r\nof the sympathy and support of that enlightened, influential, and loyal\r\nclass of my fellow citizens in an important crisis which involves, in my\r\njudgment, not only the civil and religious liberties of our own dear land,\r\nbut in a large degree the civil and religious liberties of mankind in many\r\ncountries and through many ages. You well know, gentlemen, and the world\r\nknows, how reluctantly I accepted this issue of battle forced upon me on\r\nmy advent to this place by the internal enemies of our country. You all\r\nknow, the world knows, the forces and the resources the public agents have\r\nbrought into employment to sustain a government against which there has\r\nbeen brought not one complaint of real injury committed against society\r\nat home or abroad. You all may recollect that in taking up the sword thus\r\nforced into our hands this government appealed to the prayers of the pious\r\nand the good, and declared that it placed its whole dependence on the\r\nfavor of God. I now humbly and reverently, in your presence, reiterate the\r\nacknowledgment of that dependence, not doubting that, if it shall please\r\nthe Divine Being who determines the destinies of nations, this shall\r\nremain a united people, and that they will, humbly seeking the divine\r\nguidance, make their prolonged national existence a source of new benefits\r\nto themselves and their successors, and to all classes and conditions of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO FLAG-OFFICER L. M. GOLDSBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nFORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, MAY 7, 1862\r\n\r\nFLAG-OFFICER GOLDSBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Major-General McClellan telegraphs that he has ascertained by a\r\nreconnaissance that the battery at Jamestown has been abandoned, and he\r\nagain requests that gunboats may be sent up the James River.\r\n\r\nIf you have tolerable confidence that you can successfully contend with\r\nthe Merrimac without the help of the Galena and two accompanying gunboats,\r\nsend the Galena and two gunboats up the James River at once. Please report\r\nyour action on this to me at once. I shall be found either at General\r\nWool's headquarters or on board the Miami.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER REPRIMAND OF McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nFORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, May 9, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have just assisted the Secretary of War in framing part of\r\na despatch to you relating to army corps, which despatch, of course, will\r\nhave reached you long before this will. I wish to say a few words to you\r\nprivately on this subject. I ordered the army corps organization not only\r\non the unanimous opinion of the twelve generals whom you had selected and\r\nassigned as generals of divisions, but also on the unanimous opinion of\r\nevery military man I could get an opinion from, and every modern military\r\nbook, yourself only excepted. Of course, I did not on my own judgment\r\npretend to understand the subject. I now think it indispensable for you to\r\nknow how your struggle against it is received in quarters which we cannot\r\nentirely disregard. It is looked upon as merely an effort to pamper one or\r\ntwo pets, and to persecute and degrade their supposed rivals. I have had\r\nno word from Sumner, Heintzleman, or Keyes the commanders of these corps\r\nare, of course, the three highest officers with you; but I am constantly\r\ntold that you have no consultation or communication with them; that you\r\nconsult and communicate with nobody but General Fitz John Porter, and\r\nperhaps General Franklin. I do not say these complaints are true or just;\r\nbut at all events, it is proper you should know of their existence. Do the\r\ncommanders of corps disobey your orders in anything?\r\n\r\nWhen you relieved General Hamilton of his command the other day, you\r\nthereby lost the confidence of at least one of your best friends in the\r\nSenate. And here let me say, not as applicable to you personally, that\r\nSenators and Representatives speak of me in their places without question,\r\nand that officers of the army must cease addressing insulting letters to\r\nthem for taking no greater liberty with them.\r\n\r\nBut to return. Are you strong enough--are you strong enough even with my\r\nhelp--to set your foot upon the necks of Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes\r\nall at once? This is a practical and very serious question to you?\r\n\r\nThe success of your army and the cause of the country are the same, and,\r\nof course, I only desire the good of the cause.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FLAG-OFFICER L. M. GOLDSBOROUGH,\r\n\r\nFORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, May 10, 1862\r\n\r\nFLAG-OFFICER GOLDSBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I send you this copy of your report of yesterday for the\r\npurpose of saying to you in writing that you are quite right in supposing\r\nthe movement made by you and therein reported was made in accordance with\r\nmy wishes verbally expressed to you in advance. I avail myself of the\r\noccasion to thank you for your courtesy and all your conduct, so far as\r\nknown to me, during my brief visit here.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION RAISING THE BLOCKADE OF CERTAIN PORTS.\r\n\r\nMay 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, by my proclamation of the 19th of April, one thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-one, it was declared that the ports of certain States,\r\nincluding those of Beaufort, in the State of North Carolina, Port\r\nRoyal, in the State of South Carolina, and New Orleans, in the State of\r\nLouisiana, were, for reasons therein set forth, intended to be placed\r\nunder blockade; and whereas the said ports of Beaufort, Port Royal, and\r\nNew Orleans have since been blockaded; but as the blockade of the same\r\nports may now be safely relaxed with advantage to the interests of\r\ncommerce:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section\r\nof the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July last, entitled \"An act\r\nfurther to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for\r\nother purposes,\" do hereby declare that the blockade of the said ports of\r\nBeaufort, Port Royal, and New Orleans shall so far cease and determine,\r\nfrom and after the first day of June next, that commercial intercourse\r\nwith those ports, except as to persons, things, and information contraband\r\nof war, may from that time be carried on, subject to the laws of the\r\nUnited States, and to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations\r\nwhich are prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in his order of this\r\ndate, which is appended to this proclamation.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this twelfth day of May, in the year of\r\nour Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence\r\nof the United States the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.",
