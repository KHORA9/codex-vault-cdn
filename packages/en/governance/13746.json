ELLIOT\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"EXPERIENCES OF A PLANTER,\" \"WRITTEN ON THEIR FOREHEADS,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n_WITH A MAP IN COLOURS_\r\n\r\nWESTMINSTER\r\n\r\n1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION.\r\n\r\n    I have much pleasure in dedicating this book to my friend SIR K.\r\n    SHESHADRI IYER, K.C.S.I., Dewan of Mysore, and trust that it may\r\n    be useful in making more fully known the resources of the State\r\n    whose affairs he has for many years so wisely and ably\r\n    administered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1871 I published \"The Experiences of a Planter in the Jungles\r\nof Mysore,\" and had intended to bring out a new edition of it, but, from\r\nvarious causes, the project was delayed, and when I at last took the\r\nmatter in hand, I found that so many things had happened since 1871 that\r\nit was necessary to write a new book. In this, hardly anything of the\r\n\"Experiences\" has been reproduced, except a very few natural history notes\r\nand the chapter on Caste, a subject to which I would particularly call the\r\nattention of those interested in Indian missions.\r\n\r\nI have been much assisted by informants too numerous for mention here, and\r\ncan only allude to those who have most conspicuously aided me. Amongst\r\nthese I am much indebted to my friend Sir K. Sheshadri Iyer, K.C.S.I.,\r\nDewan of Mysore, for access given me to information in the possession of\r\nthe Government, and for returns specially prepared for the book. From my\r\nfriends Mr. Graham Anderson and Mr. Brooke Mockett, two of the most able\r\nand experienced planters in Mysore, I have derived much information and\r\nassistance. I am particularly obliged to my friend Dr. Voelcker[1] for\r\nmany valuable hints, and the chapter on manures has had the advantage of\r\nbeing read by him. For information as regards the history of coffee in\r\nCoorg I am much indebted to Mr. Meynell, who represents the large\r\ninterests of Messrs. Matheson and Co. in that province, and indeed,\r\nwithout his aid, I could not at all have done full justice to the subject.\r\nTo Mr. Grey, manager of the Nundydroog mine, I am indebted for information\r\nas regards the gold mines, and for the kind assistance he in many ways\r\nafforded me when I visited them last January. I am also obliged to Colonel\r\nGrant, Superintendent of the Mysore Revenue, Survey and Settlement\r\nDepartment, for information as regards game, and the proposed Game Act for\r\nMysore.\r\n\r\nI had intended to add a chapter on the cultivation of cardamoms and\r\npepper, but have not done so, because, for the want of recent information\r\nfrom those specially engaged in these cultivations, I could not feel\r\nconfident of doing full justice to the subject. I may, however, say that\r\nas regards cardamoms, I have good reason for supposing that there is not\r\nmuch to be added to the chapter on them which appeared in the\r\n\"Experiences.\"\r\n\r\nThough I have collected many experiences, I am of course aware that many\r\nmore remain to be collected, and I should feel particularly obliged if\r\nplanters and those who have any experiences to give me (natural history\r\nand sporting information would be very welcome) would be kind enough to do\r\nso. These I would propose to incorporate in an improved edition, which I\r\nlook forward to bringing out when a sufficient amount of additional\r\ninformation has been collected. If those who have any information to give,\r\nsuggestions to make, or criticisms to offer, would be kind enough to\r\ncommunicate with me, an improved edition might be brought out which would\r\nbe highly valuable to all tropical agriculturists, and all those\r\ninterested in the various subjects on which I have written.\r\n\r\nMy Indian address is Bartchinhulla, Saklaspur, Mysore State, and home\r\naddress, Clifton Park, Kelso, Roxburghshire.\r\n\r\nROBERT H.

Valuable as nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.--MANURE.\r\n\r\nHow shade complicates the economical and effective manuring of\r\n    coffee.\r\n\r\nBulk manures as a rule should not be applied to land directly\r\n    under shade trees, but to more open spaces.\r\n\r\nLess manure should be applied to coffee directly under shade\r\n    trees.\r\n\r\nManure should be varied on different aspects. The quantity that\r\n    should be annually supplied.\r\n\r\nBones may be seldom used if lime is regularly applied.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of manure required even though the loss\r\n    from crops is small.\r\n\r\nA test of land being sufficiently supplied with manure. The\r\n    quantity of manure probably required.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of manure that should be put down at a time.\r\n\r\nDanger from over-manuring, especially in ease of light soils.\r\n\r\nRidges should be more heavily manured than hollows. The time of\r\n    year when manures should be applied.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of manuring at the end of the monsoon.\r\n\r\nBearing that the time of applying manures has on leaf disease.\r\n    Mr. Marshall Ward's remarks as to this.\r\n\r\nThe various methods of applying manures.\r\n\r\nIn the case of steep land the manure should be buried in\r\n    trenches. Farmyard manure. Its great value for coffee.\r\n\r\nSubstitutes for farmyard manure.\r\n\r\nValue of forest land top soil as a manure, and as a substitute\r\n    for farmyard manure.\r\n\r\nThe comparative cost of farmyard manure and top soil. Remarkable\r\n    result from an application of pink-coloured soil.\r\n\r\nIf top soil costs the same as farmyard manure the former is\r\n    better. Reasons for this being so. A compost of pink soil and\r\n    manures may be made, which will equal good farmyard manure, and\r\n    cost but little more.\r\n\r\nThe manurial value of pulp, and of dry fallen leaves.\r\n\r\nManurial value of green twigs of trees, ferns and wood ashes.\r\n\r\nNight soil. Lime.\r\n\r\nBonedust. Fish manure.\r\n\r\nOil-cakes. Proportion of phosphate of lime in castor cake.\r\n\r\nNitrates of potash and soda.\r\n\r\nPotash. A manure of doubtful value in the case of Mysore soils.\r\n\r\nAttempt to ascertain value of potash as a manure for coffee.\r\n\r\nHow to grow young plants in old soils. Coprolites, discovery of,\r\n    in Mysore.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural chemist wanted for the province. A careful record\r\n    should be kept of manure applied.\r\n\r\nBringing round a neglected plantation. Steps that should be\r\n    taken.\r\n\r\nManurial experiments.\r\n\r\nNative manurial practises should be studied. Application of\r\n    various soils as top dressing by native cultivators. The best and\r\n    most economical way of manuring coffee has yet to be discovered.\r\n\r\nManurial experiments need not be costly.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.--NURSERIES, TOPPING, HANDLING, PRUNING, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe selection of seed.\r\n\r\nIrrigated coffee near Bangalore. Mr. Meenakshia's gardens. The\r\n    selection of a site for a nursery.\r\n\r\nThe best time for putting down the seed.\r\n\r\nPlants should be grown in baskets. The pits for vacancy plants.\r\n\r\nTopping. The best heights for.\r\n\r\nThe time when trees should be topped.\r\n\r\nHandling and the removal of suckers. Its importance as regards\r\n    rot and leaf disease.\r\n\r\nPruning.\r\n\r\nManagement of pruning, with reference to rot and leaf disease.\r\n\r\nThe removal of moss and rubbing down the trees. The cultivation\r\n    of the soil.\r\n\r\nDifficulties connected with the proper cultivation of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe best tools for digging. Renovation pits.\r\n\r\nRenovation pits valuable as water-holes. Their value in\r\n    connection with water conservation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.--THE DISEASES OF COFFEE.\r\n\r\nLeaf disease, or attacks of _Hemeleïa Vastatrix_.\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall Ward's report on leaf disease in Ceylon. Leaf\r\n    disease probably always existed in Mysore. Said to have caused\r\n    much loss on some estates.\r\n\r\nLosses of leaves from other causes commonly attributed to leaf\r\n    disease. No reason to fear it if land is well cultivated,\r\n    manured, and shaded. Evidence that shade can control leaf\r\n    disease.\r\n\r\nBad kinds of shade trees cannot control, but increase leaf\r\n    disease.\r\n\r\nConditions under which leaf disease is liable to occur in the\r\n    cases of good soil under good shade trees.\r\n\r\nThe importance of manure and cultivation with reference to leaf\r\n    disease. Mr. Graham Anderson's, Mr. Marshall Ward's and Mr.\r\n    Brooke Mockett's opinions. The Coorg plant not so liable to be\r\n    attacked as the Chick plant.\r\n\r\nThe Borer insect.\r\n\r\nBorer is worst under bad kinds of shade trees, but can be\r\n    controlled by good caste trees.\r\n\r\nConditions favorable to attacks of the Borer.\r\n\r\nReasons for thinking that the usual practice of destroying all\r\n    bored trees is of little use.\r\n\r\nThe Borer can only be suppressed by adequate shade. Rot, or\r\n    _pellicularia koleroga_. Aggravated by want of free circulation\r\n    of air.\r\n\r\nMeasures for lessening rot. Importance of meeting monsoon with\r\n    mature leaves on the coffee trees.\r\n\r\nGreen-bugs. None in Mysore, Receipt for killing them used on\r\n    Nilgiri Hills.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.--THE SELECTION OF LAND FOR PLANTATIONS, AND THE VALUATION OF\r\nCOFFEE PROPERTY.\r\n\r\nMuch uncleared land available in northern part of Mysore.\r\n\r\nThe various classes of forest lands.\r\n\r\nMuch land unsuitable from over heavy rainfall. Mr. Graham\r\n    Anderson's return of rainfall. His interesting memorandum.\r\n\r\nElevation of plantations above sea level. With a few exceptions\r\n    not much difference in value of the coffee of various estates.\r\n\r\nThe especial importance of aspect in Mysore.\r\n\r\nThe most favourable gradients. Various kinds of soil.\r\n\r\nComparative healthiness of the different coffee districts in\r\n    Mysore.\r\n\r\nVarious considerations to be taken into account when valuing\r\n    land.\r\n\r\nAn old established estate may not necessarily be an old\r\n    plantation.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the shade ought largely to affect a valuation of a\r\n    property.\r\n\r\nFacilities that should be considered when valuing a property.\r\n\r\nImpossible to offer opinion as to value of coffee property, till\r\n    facts as regard it are widely known, and the line is opened to\r\n    western coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.--HOW TO MAKE AN ESTATE PAY, AND THE ORDER OF THE WORK.\r\n\r\nInferior parts of estates should be thrown out of cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe losses caused by giving advances.\r\n\r\nAdvances not so necessary as formerly, as labour rates are higher\r\n    now.\r\n\r\nAdvances to Maistries to bring labour.\r\n\r\nMinor sources of loss. The order in which the various works\r\n    should be performed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.--THE MANAGEMENT OF ABSENTEE ESTATES.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, we all require a little looking after.\"\r\n\r\nAdvisable to give manager an interest in the estate. Managers for\r\n    estates in Mysore require to be very carefully selected.\r\n\r\nA clear understanding essential between proprietor and manager.\r\n\r\nPowers of attorney should be carefully drawn up. The proprietor\r\n    entirely in the power of the manager.\r\n\r\nThe value of the eye of the owner. Every estate should have an\r\n    information book.\r\n\r\nPoints to be entered in the information book.\r\n\r\nHints to managers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.--THE PLANTER'S BUNGALOW AND THE AMENITIES OF AN ESTATE.\r\n\r\nThe best form of bungalow.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the bungalow and ground around it.\r\n\r\nCash value of the amenities of an estate. The flower garden.\r\n\r\nBuilding materials.\r\n\r\nHow to keep out white ants.\r\n\r\nCoolie lines.\r\n\r\nTree planting for timber and fuel.\r\n\r\nPrecautions for the conservation of health.\r\n\r\nHints as regards food, and the table generally.\r\n\r\nSuggestions as to books and newspapers.\r\n\r\nImportance of having some interesting pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe minor amenities of an estate.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of a planter's life now ameliorated by railways.\r\n\r\nMysore out of the reach of House of Commons faddists. Advantages\r\n    of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.--THE INDIAN SILVER QUESTION.\r\n\r\nOn June 26th, 1893, gold standard introduced and mints closed to\r\n    free coinage of silver.\r\n\r\nMovement originated in India by the servants of Government, and\r\n    from no other class whatever.\r\n\r\nSome merchants afterwards joined in the agitation. Gold to be\r\n    received at the mints at a ratio of 1s. 4d. per rupee.\r\n    Sovereigns in payment of sums due to Government to be received at\r\n    the rate of fifteen rupees a sovereign.\r\n\r\nCash effects of the measure. For benefit of English reader\r\n    figures given in pounds sterling, a rupee taken at 2s. Rupee\r\n    prices little changed in India, China and Ceylon. Difficulty of\r\n    forming exact estimates as to this.\r\n\r\nIf gold value of silver can be forced up from 1s. 3d. to 1s.\r\n    4d., Indian Government will gain about one and a half million\r\n    sterling on its home remittances, and the people lose about seven\r\n    millions on their exports.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Finance Minister contemplates a rise to 1s. 6d.\r\n    eventually.\r\n\r\nA rise to 1s. 6d. would give the Exchequer a gain on home\r\n    remittances of £4,500,000 and entail on the people a loss\r\n    £21,000,000, equal to a tax of 21 per cent. on the exports of\r\n    India. Effects of this on the producers.\r\n\r\nThe producers of coffee in Mysore alone would lose £56,000 a year\r\n    were exchange forced up to 1s. 4d., and £156,000 a year were it\r\n    raised to 1s. 6d. All producers in other parts of India of\r\n    articles of export would be similarly affected.\r\n\r\nIf the rupee is artificially forced up by the State, the shock to\r\n    confidence will repel capital and injure credit. The first effect\r\n    will show itself in a lessened demand for labour.\r\n\r\nThe effects of increased employment on the finances. The bearing\r\n    of the measure on famines and scarcity. It will intensify the\r\n    effects of both, and make them more costly to the State.\r\n\r\nThe measure has arrayed all classes against the Government,\r\n    except its own servants and a very few of the merchants.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the measure on the tea-planters of India and\r\n    Ceylon. It must heavily affect both. If Ceylon establishes a\r\n    mint, tea-planters there will have advantages over their rivals\r\n    in India.\r\n\r\nCoffee planters of India and Ceylon will he prejudicially\r\n    affected in their competition with silver-using countries. Evil\r\n    effects of the measure on the trade, manufactures, and railways\r\n    of India.\r\n\r\nThe measure rotten from financial, political, and economical\r\n    points of view.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy and the supporters of the measure have admitted that\r\n    it must be injurious to the producers of India. Sir William\r\n    Hunter's admirable survey of the former and present financial\r\n    condition of India.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy has publicly declared that cheap silver has acted as\r\n    \"a stimulus\" to the progress of India.\r\n\r\nThe unfair action of Lord Herschell's Committee. Not a single\r\n    representative of the producing classes examined. But the\r\n    majority of witnesses were dead against the monetary policy of\r\n    the Government. The Currency Committee reported against the\r\n    weight of the evidence. The most important points not inquired\r\n    into at all by the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Government and Currency Committee financially\r\n    panic-stricken, and in dread of effects of repeal of Sherman Act.\r\n    The financial condition not such as to warrant panic. Taxational\r\n    resources not exhausted.\r\n\r\nSir William Hunter's statement proves that the financial\r\n    conditions were full of hope. The dread that the repeal of the\r\n    Sherman Act might reduce rupee to 1s. Examination of the\r\n    subject on that supposition.\r\n\r\nBy a rate of 1s. a rupee the Government would lose about seven\r\n    millions on its home remittances, and the people of India gain\r\n    fourteen millions on their exports. Mr. Gladstone's Government\r\n    adopted Home Rule Bill, and Currency Measure in one year. Both\r\n    forced on by tyrannical action. Gladstonian action as to Opium\r\n    Commission equally tyrannical.\r\n\r\nThe monetary measure a policy of protection for the benefit of\r\n    the silver-using countries that compete with India.\r\n\r\nSome of the evils the measure, if successful, must cause. The\r\n    Indian Finance Minister declared that \"it ought not to be\r\n    attempted unless under the pressure of necessity.\" No necessity\r\n    arisen. An independent body wanted to efficiently check the\r\n    Government. The Duke of Wellington's opinion.\r\n\r\nIndia and Mexico compared. Mr. Carden's Consular Report.\r\n\r\nCheap silver advantageous to Mexico. The losses to the Government\r\n    and railways which arise from gold payments are, comparatively\r\n    speaking, a fixed quantity, while the gain to the people from\r\n    cheap silver, produces consequential benefits far beyond reach of\r\n    calculation. These remarks equally applicable to India. Wanted, a\r\n    Government that can see this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.--PROGRESS IN MYSORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I now turn my thoughts back to the year 1855, when, being then in my\r\neighteenth year, I sailed for India to seek my fortunes in the jungles of\r\nMysore, it is difficult to believe that the journey is still the same, or\r\nthat India is still the same country on the shores of which I landed so\r\nlong ago. But after all, as a matter of fact, the journey is, practically\r\nspeaking, not the same, and still less is India the same India which I\r\nknew in 1855. For the route across Egypt, which was then partly by rail,\r\npartly by water, and partly across the desert in transits, the bumping of\r\nwhich I even now distinctly remember, has been exchanged for the Suez\r\nCanal, and the frequent steamers with their accelerated rate of speed have\r\naltered all the relations of distances, and on landing at Bombay the\r\ntraveller of 1855 would now find it difficult to recognize the place. For\r\nthen there were the old fort walls and ditches, and narrow streets filled\r\nwith a straggling throng of carts and people, while now the fort walls and\r\nditches no longer exist, and the traveller drives into a city with public\r\nbuildings, broad roads and beautiful squares and gardens, that would do\r\ncredit to any capital in the world, and sees around him all the signs of\r\nadvanced and advancing civilization. Then as, perhaps, he views the scene\r\nfrom the Tower of the Elphinstone College, and looks down on the\r\nbeautiful city, on the masts of the shipping lying in the splendid\r\nharbour, and on the moving throngs of people to whom we have given peace\r\nand order, what thoughts must fill his mind! And what thoughts further, as\r\non turning to view the scene without the city he sees on one side of it\r\nthe tall chimneys of the numerous mills which have sprung up in recent\r\ntimes, and which tell of the conjunction of English skill and capital with\r\nthe cheap hand-labour of the East--a combination that is destined, and at\r\nno very distant period ahead, to produce remarkable effects. But I must\r\nnot wander here into the consideration of matters to which I shall again\r\nhave occasion to refer when I come to remark on the wonderful progress\r\nmade in India in recent years owing to the introduction of English skill\r\nand capital, and shall now briefly describe my route to the western\r\njungles of Mysore.\r\n\r\nWhen I landed in Bombay, in 1855, the journey to the Native State of\r\nMysore, now so easy and simple, was one requiring much time and no small\r\ndegree of trouble, for the railway lines had then advanced but little--the\r\nfirst twenty miles in all India having been only opened near Bombay in\r\n1853. A land journey then was not to be thought of, and as there were no\r\ncoasting-steamers, I was compelled to take a passage in a Patama (native\r\nsailing craft) which was proceeding down the western coast with a cargo of\r\nsalt which was stowed away in the after-part of the vessel. Over this was\r\na low roofed and thatched house, the flooring of which was composed of\r\nstrips of split bamboo laid upon the salt. On this I placed my mattress\r\nand bedding. My provisions for the voyage were very simple--a coop with\r\nsome fowls, some tea, sugar, cooking utensils, and other small necessaries\r\nof life. A Portuguese servant I had hired in Bombay cooked my dinner and\r\nlooked after me generally. We sailed along the sometimes bare, and\r\noccasionally palm-fringed, shores with that indifference to time and\r\nprogress which is often the despair and not unfrequently the envy of\r\nEuropeans. The hubble-bubble passed from mouth to mouth, and the crew\r\nwhiled away the evening hours with their monotonous chants. We always\r\nanchored at night; sometimes we stopped for fishing, and once ran into a\r\nsmall bay--one of those charming scenic gems which can only be found in\r\nthe eastern seas--to land some salt and take in cocoa-nuts and other\r\nitems. As for the port of Mangalore, for which I was bound, it seemed to\r\nbe, though only about 450 miles from Bombay, an immense distance away, and\r\npractically was nearly as far as Bombay is from Suez. At last, after a\r\nnine days' sail, we lay to off the mouth of the harbour into which, for\r\nreasons best known to himself, the captain of the craft did not choose to\r\nenter, and I was taken ashore in a canoe to be kindly received by the\r\njudge of the collectorate of South Kanara, to whom I had a letter of\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nAfter spending some pleasant days at Mangalore I set out for Manjarabad,\r\nthe talook or county which borders on the South Kanara district--in what\r\nis called a manshiel--a kind of open-sided cot slung to a bamboo pole\r\nwhich projects far enough in front and rear to be placed with ease on the\r\nshoulders of the bearers. Four of these men are brought into play at once,\r\nwhile four others run along to relieve their fellows at intervals. I\r\nstarted in the afternoon, and was carried up the banks of a broad river by\r\nthe side of which hero and there the road wound pleasantly along. In the\r\ncourse of a few hours night fell, and then all nature seemed to come into\r\nactive life with the hum of insects, the croaking of frogs, and various\r\nother indications of an abounding animal life. Presently I was lulled to\r\nsleep by the monotonous chant of the bearers--sleep only partially broken\r\nwhen changes of the whole set of bearers had to be made--and awoke the\r\nfollowing morning to find myself some fifty miles from the coast, and\r\namidst the gorges of the Ghauts, with vast heights towering upwards, and\r\nalmost all around, while the river, which had now sunk to what in English\r\nideas would still seem to be one of considerable size, appeared as if it\r\nhad just emerged from the navel of a mountain-barrier some miles ahead.\r\nAfter a few miles more we passed the last hamlet of what was then called\r\nthe Company's Country, and leaving the inhabited lands--if indeed in a\r\nEuropean sense they may be called so--behind us, began to ascend the\r\ntwenty miles of forest-clad gorges which lead up into the tableland of\r\nMysore. The ascent was necessarily slow, and it was not till late in the\r\nafternoon that I saw, some 500 feet above me, and at a total elevation of\r\nabout 3,200 feet above sea-level, the white walls of the only planter's\r\nbungalow in the southern part of Mysore. To this pioneer of our\r\ncivilization--Mr. Frederick Green, who had begun work in 1843--I had a\r\nletter of introduction, and was most kindly received, and put in the way\r\nof acquiring land which I started on and still hold. To the south, in the\r\nadjacent little province of Coorg--now, as we shall afterwards see, an\r\nextensive coffee-field--the first European plantation had been started the\r\nyear before, i.e., 1854, while to the north some fifty to seventy miles\r\naway the country was, in a European sense, occupied by only three English,\r\nor, to be exact, Scotch planters. In 1856 I started active life as a\r\nplanter on my own account, about twelve miles away from the estate of Mr.\r\nGreen, while in the same year two other planters--Scotchmen by the\r\nway--made their appearance. The southern part of Mysore was thus occupied\r\nby four planters, and we were all about twelve miles from each other. It\r\nis difficult to conceive the state of isolation in which we lived, and as\r\nwe were all Europeanly speaking single handed, and could seldom leave\r\nhome, we often had not for weeks together an opportunity of seeing a\r\nsingle white face, and so rare indeed was a visit from a neighbour that,\r\nwhen one was coming to see me, I used to sit on a hill watching for the\r\nfirst glimpse of him, like a shipwrecked mariner on a desert island\r\nwatching for the glimpse of a sail on the horizon. As for the Indian\r\nmutinies, which broke out the year after I had started work, they might\r\nhave been going on in Norway as far as we were concerned; none of us at\r\nall appreciated the importance and gravity of the events that were\r\noccurring, and one of my neighbours said that it was not worth while\r\ntrying to understand the situation, and that we had better wait for the\r\nbook that would be sure to come out when things had settled down. And the\r\nnative population around us appeared to know as little of the mutinies as\r\nwe did. They seemed to be aware that some disturbance was going on\r\nsomewhere in the north, and that represented the whole extent of their\r\nknowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\nI have described our life as having been one of great isolation so far as\r\nEuropean society was concerned, but I never felt it to be a dull one, nor\r\ndid my neighbours ever complain of it, though we only took a holiday of a\r\nfew weeks in the year. But we had plenty of work, and big game shooting,\r\nand the occupation was an interesting one, and as I even now return with\r\npleasure every winter to my planter's life, this proves that my earlier\r\ndays must have left behind them many pleasant associations. And the\r\noccupation and sport were really all we had to depend on. We had few\r\nbooks, nor any means of getting them, for I need hardly say that pioneer\r\nplanters, who have to keep themselves and their coffee till the latter\r\ncomes into bearing, cannot afford to buy anything that can be dispensed\r\nwith. But after all this perhaps was no disadvantage, for, as a great\r\nmoral philosopher has pointed out, nothing tends to weaken the resources\r\nof the mind so much as a miscellaneous course of reading unaccompanied (as\r\nit usually is, I may remark) by reflection. The management of people, the\r\nbusiness of an estate, the exercise of the inventive powers, the\r\ncultivation of method, the sharpening of the observing and combining\r\nfaculties, which are so well developed by big game shooting, yield real\r\neducation, or the leading out and development of the mental resources,\r\nwhile books provide the individual merely with instruction which has often\r\na tendency to cramp and even to fossilize the mind.\r\n\r\nI have said at the outset, that the journey to India is not the same as it\r\nwas in 1855, and that still less is India the same India, and I may\r\ncertainly say that still less is Western Mysore the Western Mysore of\r\n1855, except that its beautiful scenery is as beautiful as ever. For our\r\nplanting is not like that of Ceylon, where the planter, like the locust,\r\nfinds a paradise in front to leave a desert in his rear--a desert of bare\r\nlull sides from which the beautiful forest has been entirely swept away,\r\nwhile the most valuable constituents of the soil have been washed down to\r\nthe river beds. And when standing in 1893 on a lull in my district of\r\nManjarabad, and looking around, I can see no sign of change in the\r\nlandscape from the days of 1855, except that the woodland paths leading\r\nfrom village to village are much more distinctly marked, owing to the\r\ngreat increase of labourers employed in the numerous native and European\r\nplantations, which now stretch in an unbroken line along all the western\r\nborder of Mysore. And no sign of change is apparent, because all the\r\ncoffee is planted either under the shade of the original forest trees, or\r\nunder the shade of trees which have been planted to take their place. But\r\nall else is practically and largely changed by the agency of a universal\r\nprogress, which has been brought about by British government and the\r\nintroduction of British capital, skill, and energy. And this progress, I\r\nam glad to be able to say, has benefited all classes of the community, and\r\nthe labouring classes by far the most of all, and the results as regards\r\nthose are so striking, so interesting, and so much more widely diffused\r\nthan could at first sight be thought possible, and are, as I shall show,\r\nof such vast importance to the finances of the State, that they are well\r\nworthy of special attention. Had the Government been aware of the enormous\r\nfinancial value to the State of the introduction of English capital, I\r\nfeel sure that much greater efforts would have been made to stimulate\r\nEuropean enterprise, and that the progress of India would have been much\r\naccelerated all along the line.\r\n\r\nWhen I started my plantation in 1858, the pay of a labourer was 2 rupees 4\r\nannas (4s. 6d.) a month. It is now, throughout the numerous plantations\r\nin Mysore, from six to seven rupees a month, and a labourer can live on\r\nabout two rupees a month. Such a statement made of any country would\r\nindicate a satisfactory degree of progress; but whereas in England it\r\nwould simply mean a greater ability in the working classes to live in an\r\nimproved condition, and perhaps some improvement in the condition of the\r\nshopkeepers with whom they dealt, in India it means the creation of a\r\nsocial and ever wide-spreading revolution. For when in India capital is\r\nintroduced, and employment on a large scale is afforded to the people, the\r\npoorer of the peasant classes are at once able to free themselves from\r\ndebt, and the labourers soon save enough money to enable them to start in\r\nagriculture, coffee culture, or any culture within, their reach. The\r\nresult of this, in my experience, has been most remarkable. When I started\r\nin Manjarabad, for instance, the planters relied solely on labour procured\r\nfrom the adjacent villages. But now the local labourer is almost a thing\r\nof the past, for he has taken to agriculture and coffee culture, and now\r\nonly occasionally works for a short time to earn some money to pay his\r\ntaxes. When this change began, the planters had of course to go further\r\nafield for labour, but merely to produce over again a similar result by\r\nenabling labourers from distant villages to do what the local labourers in\r\nthe coffee districts had done, and thus for labour we have to operate on\r\never-widening circles, till at last I have heard it remarked that the\r\nKanarese language is often of little use, and the native overseers on my\r\nestate have complained that they now often cannot make the labourers\r\nunderstand them. And this of course is not surprising, as at one moment\r\nthe overseer may have to deal with labourers from any one of the villages\r\nbetween Mysore and the Western Sea, and at another with people from\r\nvillages in the Madras Presidency, far away on the route to the Bay of\r\nBengal. Field after field, and village after village, has thus been\r\nirrigated by that capital for which India thirsts, and which, as we have\r\nseen, produces such wide-spreading social effects on the welfare of the\r\npeople, and, consequently, on the resources of the State--enabling land to\r\nbe more largely and fully developed, wells to be dug, gardens to be made,\r\nand the people to pay with greater ease the demands of the Government. But\r\nthere is yet another point of great importance to notice as regards the\r\nintroduction into India of European capital, with its accompanying\r\neffects--effects which largely enhance its value--namely, those arising\r\nfrom setting the natives practical examples of both method, skill, and\r\nenergetic action. I allude to the bearing of these forces upon famine--a\r\nsubject well worthy of some passing remarks, more especially because in\r\nMysore we can furnish proofs of the value in times of famine of having\r\nEuropeans settled in the country.\r\n\r\nThe actual money value of the infuse of English capitalists, and its\r\nbearing on the resources of the State, and in enabling the people the\r\nbetter to contest with famine and scarcity, is sufficiently apparent, but\r\nit was only when the terrible famine of 1876-77 (which cost Mysore the\r\nloss of about a fifth of its population, an immense sum of money, and\r\ncrippled its resources for years) broke out that the value of having a\r\nEuropean agency ready at hand to grapple with famine, and honestly\r\nadminister the funds available, was absolutely proved. It would be tedious\r\nto go into this subject at any length, indeed I have not space to do so,\r\nand I can only say that, as far as I could learn, the only satisfactory\r\ntreatment of the great famine was that initiated and carried out by the\r\nplanters, or, to be at once just and exact, I should rather say that the\r\nsystem adopted was initiated by one of our leading planters--Mr. Graham\r\nAnderson--who, and entirely at his own cost, was the first to start and\r\nmaintain on his estate a nursery for children. He saw that if the parents\r\ncould only be relieved of their children the former could work and be able\r\nto maintain themselves, while all their efforts would be insufficient to\r\nmaintain at once themselves and their children. The nursery system that\r\nwas then initiated by Mr. Anderson, was adopted by other planters who were\r\nsubsequently aided by the assistance of money from the Mansion House Fund,\r\nand Mr. Anderson was formally appointed by the Government as President of\r\nthe relief operations in the Southern Mysore coffee district, and, owing\r\nto his energy, example, and administrative still, most satisfactory\r\nresults were obtained. I have before me, and written by Mr. Anderson, a\r\nfull account of all the famine relief operations he had charge of, showing\r\nthe assistance afforded by the planters in employing labour from which,\r\nowing to the weakness of the people, very little return could be got; and\r\nmoreover by sheltering in their lines the wandering starvelings who were\r\nmoving about the country. I can only regret that want of space prevents my\r\ngoing into the subject more in detail. I must, however, at least find room\r\nfor his concluding remarks, in order to deliver for him a message he has\r\nlong been desirous of sending to those of the English public who\r\nsubscribed to the Mansion House Fund.\r\n\r\n\"If there is one thing,\" writes Mr. Anderson, \"I am certain of it is this,\r\nthat although some people think that natives have no gratitude, there has\r\nnever been anything concerning which the natives have been so loud in\r\ntheir praise as the unbounded generosity of the London public, who in time\r\nof fearful distress came forward with money to feed and clothe hundreds\r\nand thousands of starving poor. Many a poor woman and man have asked me to\r\nexpress blessings to 'the people of my village' who rescued them in their\r\ndire distress. Perhaps you can give this message, which, as an outsider, I\r\nhave never had an opportunity of doing.\" I only wish I could add that the\r\ngratitude of the Government was equal to that of the natives. Yes, Mr.\r\nGraham Anderson was an outsider, and the Government (Mysore was under\r\nBritish rule at the time) was evidently determined that he should remain\r\nso in the fullest sense of the word, for he never even received a letter\r\nof thanks for his valuable and gratuitous services, or the smallest notice\r\nof any kind. I have no hesitation in praising most highly the action of\r\nthe planters, because, though one of them, I was not in India at the time,\r\nand, though my estate manager took an early and active part in relief\r\noperations, I had nothing personally to do with the famine relief work.\r\n\r\nThe subject of famines is of such vast importance to the people, the\r\nGovernment, and all who have any stake in India, that I think it well to\r\noffer here some remarks on them, and also suggest some measures for their\r\nprevention, or perhaps I should rather say for their mitigation.\r\n\r\nThe causes that would lead to an increase of famines in India were fully\r\npointed out by me in 1871 in the \"Experiences of a Planter,\" in letters to\r\nthe \"Times,\" and in the evidence I gave when examined by the India\r\nFinance Committee of the House of Commons in 1872. There were two\r\nprincipal causes--the spread of the use of money instead of grain as a\r\nmedium of exchange, and such a restricted development of communications\r\nthat, while these were sufficient to drain the countries in the interior\r\nof their grain, they were not sufficiently developed to enable the grain\r\nto be brought back again in sufficient quantities when it was necessary to\r\ndo so in times of famine. Till, then, communications were developed to an\r\nadequate extent, it was quite clear that India would be much more exposed\r\nto risk from famines than she was in the days when grain was largely used\r\nas a medium of exchange, and when, besides, grain, from the want of\r\ncommunication, was largely kept in the country. The people, in short, in\r\nthe olden days, and even for some time after I landed in India, hoarded\r\ngrain, and in times of scarcity they encroached upon their supplies of\r\nburied grain, whereas now they hoard money, which in time of famine can go\r\nbut a very short way in buying grain. The statement that an increase of\r\nfamines would be sure to ensue from the causes above indicated is amply\r\ncorroborated by the facts. There is no evidence to show that droughts have\r\nincreased, but there can be no doubt that in comparatively recent times\r\nfamines and scarcities have. And in looking over the list of famines from\r\n1769 to 1877, I find that, comparing the first 84 years of the period in\r\nquestion with the years from then up to 1877, famines have more than\r\ndoubled in number, and scarcities, causing great anxiety to the State,\r\nseem certainly to be increasing. That the latter are so we have strong\r\nevidence in Mysore, and in looking over the annual addresses of the Dewan\r\nat the meeting of the Representative Assembly of Mysore, I am struck with\r\nthe frequent allusion to scarcities and grave apprehensions of famine. In\r\nhis address of 1881, only four years after the great famine of 1876-77,\r\nthe Dewan refers to \"the period of intense anxiety through which the\r\nGovernment and the people have passed owing to the recent failure of the\r\nrains. But,\" he adds, \"such occasional failure of rains is almost a normal\r\ncondition of the Province, and the Government must always remain in\r\nconstant anxiety as to the fearful results which must follow from them.\"\r\nIn his address of 1884 the Dewan says that \"the condition of the Province\r\nis again causing grave anxiety.\" In the address of 1886 the Dewan says\r\n\"this is the first year since the rendition of the Province (in 1881) in\r\nwhich the prospects of the season have caused no anxiety to the\r\nGovernment.\" But in the address of 1891 lamentations again occur, and we\r\nfind the Dewan congratulating the members on the narrow escape, owing to\r\nrain having fallen just in time, they had had from famine. But our able\r\nDewan--Sir K. Sheshadri Iyer, K.C.I.E.--has taken measures which must\r\nultimately place the Province in a safe position, or at least in as safe a\r\nposition as it can be placed. He has seen, and it has been amply proved by\r\nour experience in the Madras Presidency during the famine of 1876-77, that\r\nthe only irrigation work that can withstand a serious drought is a deep\r\nwell, and he has brought out a most admirable measure for encouraging the\r\nmaking of them by the ryots. The principal features of this are that\r\nmoney, to be repaid gradually over a long series of years, is to be\r\nadvanced by the State on the most easy terms, and that, in the event of a\r\nryot taking a loan, and water not being found, or found in inadequate\r\nquantity, the Government takes upon itself the entire loss. But the\r\nresults from this highly liberal and valuable measure cannot be adequately\r\narrived at for many years to come, and in the meanwhile the risks from\r\nfamine go on, and as the Dewan has seen that these can only be immediately\r\ngrappled with by an extension of the railway system, he has always been,\r\nanxious to make a line to the western frontier of Mysore, if the Madras\r\nGovernment would agree to carry it on to Mangalore on the western coast.\r\nBut the Madras Government felt itself unable to find funds to carry out\r\nthe project, and hence Mysore, all along its western frontier, was, from a\r\nrailway point of view, completely imprisoned, and there seemed to be no\r\nprospect of anything being done to connect the Province with the western\r\nseaboard for many years to come. However, a Mysore planter last year\r\nsought a personal interview with Viscount Cross, the Secretary of State\r\nfor India, who has always taken a great interest in railway extensions,\r\nand the result of this was that Lord Cross initiated action which resulted\r\nin prompt steps being taken. Early this year a preliminary survey of the\r\nroute from a point on the line in the interior of Mysore, _viâ_ the\r\nManjarabad Ghaut, to Mangalore was made, and I am in a position to state\r\nthat the completion of this much and long-wanted line may be regarded as a\r\nthing of the near future. After this line has been made a line will be\r\nconstructed from Hassan to Mysore, _viâ_ Holî Nursipur, and Yedatora, and\r\nfrom Mysore a line will be run, _viâ_ Nunjengode[2] to Erode, the junction\r\nof the Madras and South Indian Railways. I may mention here that Sir\r\nAndrew Clarke, in his able Minute of 1879 on Indian Harbours, says that\r\n\"Mangalore undoubtedly admits of being converted into a useful harbour,\"\r\nthough he adds that \"the project may lie over until the prospects of a\r\nrailway connecting it with the interior are better than at present.\" As\r\nthe immediate prospects of a line being made are quite secure, it is of\r\ngreat importance to call attention to this matter now, as it is to the\r\nmanifest interest of both Governments that the harbour of Mangalore should\r\nbe improved as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAfter having done so much to contend against famine-producing causes, it\r\nmay seem that the Dewan might rest and be thankful; but it must be\r\nconsidered that, though railways will undoubtedly enable the State to save\r\nlife, it will have to pay a ruinously heavy charge whenever a widespread\r\nand serious drought occurs, and, sooner or later, it seems inevitable that\r\nsuch a drought must occur. And it is therefore perfectly evident, that\r\nwithout the extension of deep wells the province cannot be placed in a\r\nthoroughly sound financial position. It is, then, of obvious importance to\r\nremove at once the great obstacle that stands in the way of the rapid\r\naddition to the number of deep wells. That obstacle, and a most formidable\r\nobstacle it is, as I shall fully show, lies in the fact that the present\r\nform of land tenure in Mysore (under which also about four-fifths of the\r\nland of British India are held) does not provide a sufficient security for\r\ninvestors in landed improvements. By the existing tenure the land is held\r\nby the occupier from the State at a rental which is fixed for thirty\r\nyears, and after that it is liable to augmentation. The Government, it is\r\ntrue, has declared that it will not tax improvements, and that, for\r\ninstance, if a man digs a well no augmentation of rent will be demanded\r\nfor the productive power thus added to the land, but it has reserved to\r\nitself wide powers of enhancing the rent on general grounds, such as a\r\nrise in prices, improved communication, etc., and to what amount the\r\nenhancement may go the ryot cannot tell. And hence we find that the\r\nrepresentatives in the Mysore Assembly have repeatedly argued that it is\r\nowing to the uncertainty as to what the rise of rent may be at the close\r\nof each thirty years' period that improvements are not more largely made,\r\nand have therefore prayed for a permanently fixed assessment. Now I am not\r\nprepared to say that, for the present at any rate, it would be wise to\r\ngrant a fixed assessment on all lands, but I am quite sure that it would\r\nbe wise to grant, for the irrigable area watered by a well dug at an\r\noccupier's expense, a permanent assessment at the rent now charged on the\r\nland. The Government, it is true, would sacrifice the rise it might obtain\r\non the land at the close of each lease, but, as a compensation for\r\nthis--and an ample compensation I feel sure it would be--the State would\r\nsave in two ways, for it would never have to grant remissions of revenue\r\non such lands, as it now often has to do in the case of dry lands, and\r\nwith every well dug the expenditure in time of famine would be diminished.\r\nSuch a measure, then, as I have proposed, would at once benefit the State\r\nand draw out for profitable investment much capital that is now lying\r\nidle. There is nothing new, I may add, in this proposal, for it was\r\nadopted by the old native rulers, who granted fixed tenures on favourable\r\nterms to those making irrigation works at their own expense. An\r\nEnglish-speaking Mysore landholder once said to me, \"I will not dig wells\r\non my lands under my present tenure, but give me an assessment fixed for\r\never, and I will dig lots of wells.\" The present landed policy of the\r\nIndian Government[3] is as shallow as it is hide-bound. It wants, like a\r\nchild, to eat its cake and still remain in possession of the article. It\r\nis most anxious to see private capital invested in land, and it still\r\nwants to retain the power of every thirty years indefinitely augmenting\r\nthe land revenue on general grounds. Surely it must be apparent to minds\r\nof even the humblest calibre that these two things are utterly\r\nincompatible!\r\n\r\nI may mention that there is a strong party in India in favour of granting\r\nat once a permanent assessment at the existing rate of rent for all lands,\r\nand in reference to this point it may be interesting to give the following\r\npassage from a letter I once received from the late Prime Minister of\r\nMysore, Mr. Rungacharlu, the minister who started the first Representative\r\nAssembly that ever sat in India:\r\n\r\n\"As you know,\" he wrote, \"I hold decided views on the subject, and the\r\nwithholding of the permanent assessment is a serious injury to the\r\nextensive petty landed interests in the country, and is no gain whatever\r\nto the Government. Nearly the whole population of the country are\r\nagriculturists, and live in one way or another upon the cultivation of the\r\nland. The effect of a permanent settlement will therefore create a greater\r\nfeeling of security, and to encourage the outlay of capital and labour on\r\nland will be beneficial to the entire population. It will thus be quite a\r\nnational measure reaching all, and not in the interests of a few, and is\r\ncalculated to develop the capabilities of the land to the utmost. The\r\nprospect of the Government ever being benefited by the reservation of an\r\nincrease of assessment on the unearned increment is a mere dream. Such\r\nincrease is sure to be resisted or evaded, occasioning meanwhile great\r\ndiscontent. The Government may confidently look to the development of\r\nother sources of revenue from the increased prosperity of the people.\"\r\n\r\nBut whether the best remedy lies in granting, as I have proposed, a fixed\r\nassessment on land brought under well-irrigation at owners' expense, or in\r\ngranting a permanent assessment for all lands, or, perhaps, in extending\r\nthe period of lease from thirty to sixty years (and the last proposal\r\nwould answer fairly well), one thing is certain, and that is, that under\r\nthe thirty years' tenure system it is impossible to expect such a\r\ndevelopment of the landed resources of India as will secure the Government\r\nfrom the vast financial losses caused by famine, or at least reduce these\r\nlosses to a moderate amount. And we have ample evidence to prove that,\r\nwhere adequate security exists, private enterprise will be sure to step in\r\nand carry out most extensive and important irrigation works. This has\r\nbeen particularly shown in the proceedings of the Government of the\r\nNorth-West Provinces and Oudh, where the condition of things in the\r\npermanently settled districts has been contrasted with that in the\r\ntemporarily settled, or thirty year leasehold districts. I have no space\r\nto go into the details. They would only weary the general reader, and it\r\nis sufficient to say that in the permanently settled districts there has\r\nbeen an immense progress in irrigation carried out by private enterprise;\r\nand that, to quote from the proceedings:--\"Throughout the whole tract\r\nthere have been occasional periods of agricultural distress, but it has\r\nalways been in a mild form, and for a century famines such as have\r\noccurred in other parts of India have been unknown.\" In short, private\r\nenterprise, backed by a fair assessment fixed for ever, has driven famine\r\nfrom the tract in question, and this will occur in other parts of India if\r\nthe Government will only grant tenures sufficiently safe to induce the\r\npeople to invest their money in wells and permanent improvements. And if\r\nfurther proofs are needed, we have only to turn to Mr. Gribble's valuable\r\nmemorandum on well irrigation, which is published in the proceedings of\r\nthe Famine Commission.\r\n\r\nIn concluding my remarks on famines, I may say that the whole question\r\nregarding them is of the greatest practical importance to all employers of\r\nlabour in India. Our labour market in Mysore was enormously injured by the\r\ngreat famine of 1876-77, when the loss of population amounted to about a\r\nmillion, and when, through the agency of railways, loss of life can be\r\naverted in the future, it will only be averted at such a cost as will\r\ncripple the resources of the State for years to come, and so lessen its\r\npowers for maintaining roads and other works in an efficient state, and\r\ndeveloping the resources of the country. The whole of the evils arising\r\nfrom famine then can only be averted by a full development of well\r\nirrigation, and this and the development of the landed resources of the\r\ncountry in general can only be effected through the agency of improved\r\ntenures. This is a point which all individuals having a stake in India\r\nshould continuously urge on the attention of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that when I started in Mysore in 1856, there were\r\nonly seven European planters in the province. I have lately endeavoured to\r\nascertain the number there are at present, and the Dewan, to whose\r\nkindness I have been much indebted for information when writing this book,\r\nhas supplied me with a specially drawn up return, showing all the\r\ninformation available as regards coffee from the year 1831 up to 1890-91,\r\nand by this it seems that there were in 1890-91 662 plantations held by\r\nEuropeans in Mysore, but there are no means of ascertaining the number of\r\nplanters. I have referred the return to one of the oldest and most\r\nadvanced planters, and in his reply he says, \"It is impossible to say\r\nexactly how many landowners the 662 plantations represent, as several of\r\nthe plantations in many cases go to make up what we call an estate, but I\r\nshould not imagine that the number would be more than 300, and in that\r\ncalculation I have allowed for there being partners in many of the\r\nproperties.\" The area held by Europeans was 49,862 acres, and some\r\nincrease has no doubt since been made to this.\r\n\r\nThe native plantations amounted to 27,180 in number in 1890-91, with an\r\narea of 96,814 acres, but many of these so-called plantations only consist\r\nof small patches of coffee. The total area of European and native holdings\r\nin 1890-91 was 146,676 acres. There are no means whatever of ascertaining\r\nfrom the returns at my command even approximately the amount of coffee\r\nproduced. A reasonable calculation, however, based on a general knowledge\r\nof the circumstances, makes it probable that the European production of\r\ncoffee may be put down at about an average of 120,000 cwts. a-year, and\r\nthe native production at about 172,000 cwts., and if we put the average\r\nvalue of both as low as £3 a cwt. this would make the annual value of the\r\ncoffee amount to £876,000. I now proceed to close this chapter with some\r\nremarks on manufactures in Mysore.\r\n\r\nMany years ago I heard the late Mr. Hugh Mason (formerly President of the\r\nManchester Chamber of Commerce) speak at a meeting of the Society of Arts\r\non the manufacturing prospects of India, and, after reviewing the general\r\nsituation, he said that it is difficult to see what other advantages India\r\ncould require in order to raise itself into the position of a great\r\nmanufacturing country. It is true, he said, that the operative there\r\ncannot do as much as the operative hero, but, he continued, I can remember\r\nthe time when the operative here could not do nearly as much as he can do\r\nnow, and there is no reason to doubt but that a similar improvement would\r\ntake place in the case of the Indian operative. And when this improvement\r\ntakes place, and India becomes more known and developed, her great\r\nmanufacturing capabilities will become fully apparent. India has two very\r\ngreat advantages. She has an abundant, docile, and orderly population, and\r\nshe obtains from the sun an ample supply of that heat which has to be paid\r\nlargely for here. When, then, the Indian operative attains to an advanced\r\ndegree of proficiency--and to this he undoubtedly will attain--the\r\ngreatest labour competition that the world has ever seen will begin--a\r\ncompetition between the white labourer who requires to be expensively fed,\r\nwarmly clothed, and well shod, and housed, and the black or brown skinned\r\nman who can live cheaply, and work naked, and who is as physically\r\ncomfortable in a mere shelter as his rival is in a well built dwelling.\r\nThe Indian peasant already, in the case of wheat, undersells the English\r\nfarmer, and it seems merely a question of time as to when the Indian\r\noperative will undersell his Lancashire rival, and when perhaps calico\r\nwill come to England, as it once did, from Calicut. And no doubt, some\r\nsuch thoughts were passing through Cobden's mind when he once said, \"What\r\nugly ruins our mills will make.\" We are, however, a considerable way from\r\nsuch remains as the reader will see if he consults the interesting paper\r\non \"The Manufactures of India,\" read by Sir Juland Danvers at a meeting of\r\nthe Society of Arts on the 24th of April last, and by this it appears that\r\nthe imports of cloths of English manufacture have increased in recent\r\nyears. Still India is progressing, and there are now a total of 126 cotton\r\nmills in all India. Of these one is in Bangalore, and was opened in 1885.\r\nThe Mysore Government took 250 shares in it, and to enable the Company to\r\nextend the buildings, subsequently lent it on easy terms two lakhs of\r\nrupees. There is also another company at work in Bangalore which started\r\nas a woollen factory, but which has now set up machines for spinning\r\ncotton. The efforts made to push forward industries of all kinds in Mysore\r\nare highly creditable to the administration, and I find numerous\r\nreferences in the annual addresses made by the Dewan at the meeting of the\r\nRepresentative Assembly to the desire of the Government to foster any kind\r\nof industry that is likely to afford increased employment to the people. A\r\nlong reference is made in the Dewan's address of 1890, to the endeavours\r\nmade by the Government to open up the iron wealth of the province, and it\r\nwas then in correspondence with a native gentleman who had proposed to\r\nstart iron works in the Malvalli Talook of the Mysore district. The\r\nGovernment, it appears, were prepared to grant most liberal concessions as\r\nregards the supply of fuel. But I regret that I have no information as to\r\nwhether these proposed works have or have not been started. For the\r\ninformation of those who might be inclined to embark in this industry I\r\nmay mention that a copy of the Dewan's annual addresses always appears in\r\nthe \"Mysore and Coorg Directory,\" which is a most valuable compilation on\r\nall points of importance relating to those provinces. These annual\r\naddresses are admirably drawn up and are most interesting to read. The\r\nattention shown to the many various points treated of is most remarkable.\r\nNothing seems too great and nothing too small for notice by the Dewan, and\r\nit is this even attention all along the line that shows the fine\r\nadministrator. As one instance to the point I may mention that when\r\nattending as a member of the Representative Assembly at Mysore in 1891, I\r\nhappened to meet the Dewan and some of his officers in the veranda outside\r\nthe great hall where our meetings were held, and his attention was\r\nattracted to a coffee peeler--the invention of a native who thought this a\r\ngood opportunity for introducing his machines to the notice of the public,\r\nand had some cherry coffee at hand to show how they worked. The Dewan at\r\nonce inspected the machine, saw the coffee put through, and himself turned\r\nthe handle, and was so satisfied that he ordered some of the machines to\r\nbe bought and sent for exhibition to the head-quarters of the coffee\r\ngrowing Talooks, or counties, and in his address of 1892 he reports that\r\nthe machines had been found to be much in favour with the planters who had\r\nused them. The state of the box is the best evidence of the goodness of\r\nthe gardener. But it is time now to draw this chapter to a close. I must,\r\nhowever, find room for a few remarks which will show those who might be\r\ninclined to settle in India that their interests are sure to be well\r\nattended to by the Government.\r\n\r\nDuring my long Indian experience I have had occasion to represent\r\ngrievances and wants to Government officers, from district officers to\r\nhigh Indian officials, to officials at the India office, and to more than\r\none Secretary of State for India, and am therefore able to testify\r\ndirectly to their admirable courtesy, patience, and consideration. In the\r\nordinary sense of the word, the planters in the various parts of India are\r\nnot represented, but as a matter of fact their interests are most\r\nefficiently represented, for the officers of the Government, whether\r\ncivilians or soldier-civilians (and when Mysore was under British rule I\r\nhad practical experience of both), are distinguished by an amount of\r\nenergy, industry, and ability, to which I believe it is impossible to find\r\na parallel in the world, and combined with these qualities there is\r\neverywhere exhibited a conscientious zeal in promoting in every possible\r\nway the interests of the countries committed to their charge. And these\r\nofficers know that they are at once the administrators and rulers of the\r\nland, and, as there is no representative system such as we have in\r\nEngland, freely admit that to them the people have a right to appeal in\r\nall matters affecting their interests. This right of personal appeal\r\nplanters most freely exercise, and in this way are sure, sooner or later,\r\nand often with very little delay, to obtain the supply of wants or the\r\nredress of grievances. And here I may offer in conclusion one useful hint.\r\nThe time of officials, and especially of high officials, is very valuable,\r\nand every effort should be made to avoid putting them to trouble that can\r\nbe avoided. The subject to be brought forward should be carefully thought\r\nout, and put in the form of a memorandum. This in some cases it is\r\nadvisable to forward by letter when asking for an interview, while in\r\nother cases I have thought it more advisable that the memorandum should be\r\ntaken with one and read to the official, as this gives a good opportunity\r\nfor discussing the points in regular order. In the latter case, at the\r\nclose of the interview, the official will probably ask that the memorandum\r\nmay be left with him for reference, but it is then better to ask to be\r\nallowed to send a well-written copy by post, as this gives an opportunity\r\nfor making clearer any points that may have been discussed at the\r\ninterview, and which may require further explanation. It is well always to\r\nbear in mind that all high officials, and the heads of districts, are\r\nrepresentatives of the Crown, and as such are entitled to a due amount of\r\ndeference and formality when being personally addressed, or addressed by\r\nletter. These are points which are sometimes not sufficiently taken into\r\naccount by inexperienced persons.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that the remarks last made apply equally to native\r\nofficials either in Mysore or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may mention that I have always found the native officials\r\nto be most polite, considerate, and obliging, and such, I feel sure, is\r\nthe general experience of those who have been brought in contact with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] When this line is finished the planters of Mysore will have an easy\r\nand very direct route by rail to the Nilgiri Hills, and this will be of\r\nimmense advantage to themselves, and especially to their families.\r\n\r\n[3] It has imposed this policy on Mysore, and by the terms of the deed of\r\ntransfer to the Rajah, no alteration in the tenures can be made without\r\nthe consent of the Supreme Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SCENERY AND WATERFALLS OF MYSORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMysore is a tract of country in Southern India approximating in area to\r\nScotland, and with a general elevation of from two to three thousand feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. It is commonly spoken of as the Mysore\r\ntableland, but this is rather a misleading description if we adopt the\r\ndictionary definition of the word tableland as being \"a tract of country\r\nat once elevated and level,\" for, though there are in the interior of the\r\nprovince considerable stretches of rolling plains, the so-called tableland\r\npresents to the view a country intersected at intervals, more or less\r\nremote, with mountain chains, while scattered here and there in the\r\ninterior of the plateau are isolated rocky hills, or rather hills of rock,\r\ntermed droogs (Sanscrit, durga, or difficult of access) which sometimes\r\nrise to a total height of 5,000 feet above sea level. The surface of the\r\ncountry, too, is often broken by groups, or clusters of rocks, either low\r\nor of moderate elevation, composed of immense boulders, the topmost ones\r\nof which are often so finely poised as to seem ready to topple over at the\r\nslightest touch. The highest point of the plateau is about 3,500 feet, and\r\nis crowned as it were by the fine bold range of the Bababuden mountains,\r\nwhich have an average elevation of about 6,000 feet. There are three\r\nmountains in Mysore which exceed this elevation, and the highest of them,\r\nMulaìnagiri, is 6,317 feet above the level of the sea. The province,\r\nwhich is completely surrounded by British territory, is flanked on the\r\nwest and east by the Ghauts, or ranges of hills up the passes through\r\nwhich the traveller ascends on to the tableland, and on the south it is,\r\nas it were, pointed off by the Nilgiri hills. The greatest breadth of\r\nMysore from north to south is about 230 miles, and its greatest length\r\nfrom east to west is 290 miles. On the western side one part of the\r\nprovince runs to within ten miles of the sea, though the average distance\r\nfrom it is from thirty to fifty miles. The nearest point to the sea on the\r\neastern side is about 120 miles, and the most southerly extremity of the\r\ntableland is 250 miles from the most southerly point of India.\r\n\r\nAs regards climate, cultivation, and the general appearance of the\r\ncountry, Mysore may be divided into two very distinctly marked tracts--the\r\nforest and woodland region which stretches from the foot of the Western\r\nGhauts to distances varying from about twenty to as much as forty-five\r\nmiles, and the rolling and comparatively speaking treeless plains of the\r\ncentral and eastern parts of the province, which are only occasionally\r\nbroken by tracts which have some of the characteristics of both. In the\r\nwestern tract are numerous plantations of coffee and cardamoms, and the\r\ncereal cultivation consists mainly of rice fields irrigated from perennial\r\nstreams; while in the central and eastern parts of the tableland, which by\r\nfar exceed in area the woodland tracts of the west, the cultivation is\r\nmainly of the millets and other crops which do not depend on irrigation,\r\nthough these are interspersed at intervals, more or less remote, with rice\r\nfields, the water for which is chiefly derived from tanks, or artificial\r\nreservoirs. The rainfall, temperature, and quality of the atmosphere in\r\nthe western tract varies considerably from those of the open country of\r\nthe interior. The rainfall of the first varies from sixty to one hundred\r\ninches, and, on the crests of the Ghauts, is probably often about 200\r\ninches,[4] while in the interior of the province the rainfall is probably\r\nabout thirty inches on the average. The temperature of the western tract\r\ntoo is naturally much damper and cooler than that of the rest of the\r\ntableland, and at my house within six miles of the crests of the Ghauts at\r\nan elevation of about 3,200 feet, the shade temperature at the hottest\r\ntime of the year and of the day rarely exceeds eighty-five, and such a\r\nthing as a hot night is unknown, as the woodland tracts are within reach\r\nof the westerly sea breezes, while in the interior the climate is much\r\nhotter and drier, and the maximum day temperature of the hot weather is\r\nabout ninety, and, in very hot seasons, about ninety-five. In the woodland\r\ntracts the cold weather and the monsoon months have a very pleasant\r\ntemperature, and then flannel shirts and light tweeds--in short, English\r\nsummer clothing--are used, and a blanket is always welcome at night. The\r\nclimate of Mysore is considered to be a healthy one for Europeans of\r\ntemperate habits, and who take reasonable care of themselves. As we are\r\nnow hearing so much of cholera in Europe, it may not be uninteresting to\r\nmention that, though the province was under British administration from\r\n1831 to 1881, and there have since been a considerable number of European\r\nofficials in the employ of the now native government of Mysore, only one\r\nEuropean official has died of cholera during that period, and that, though\r\nthere are a considerable number of planters, only one has been reported to\r\nhave died of the disease, though his, I am told, was a doubtful case.\r\n\r\nI have said that there are marked differences between the western tracts\r\nand the remainder of the province, but the most marked difference of\r\ncourse between the forest and woodland country of the west, and the\r\ncountry to the east, lies in the scenery of the two tracts, for, though in\r\nthe latter case there are occasional bits of attractive landscape, and\r\npartially wooded hills, there is nothing at all to compare with the grand\r\nforest scenery of the Western Ghauts, or the charming park-like woodlands\r\nwhich stretch into the tableland at varying distances from the crests of\r\nthe frontier mountains. Everyone who has seen the latter has been struck\r\nby their extraordinary and diversified beauty, and last year a friend of\r\nmine, who had for a considerable time been travelling all round the world,\r\nsaid to me, as he rode up to my house, \"After all I have seen I have seen\r\nnothing to equal this.\" But this, I must add, was the very best of our\r\nWestern Ghaut park scenery which is mostly contained in the talook or\r\ncounty of Manjarabad which stretches for about twenty-five miles along the\r\nwestern frontier of Mysore, a tract of country so beautiful that the\r\nlaconic Colonel Wellesley (afterwards the great Duke of Wellington), who\r\nrarely put a superfluous word into his dispatches, could not refrain from\r\nremarking in one of them on the beautiful appearance of the country.[5]\r\nThere are two things especially remarkable about this tract. The one is\r\nthat throughout the best of it there is nothing distinctively Indian in\r\nthe scenery. Bamboos are rare, and in much of the tract entirely absent,\r\nand as the palm trees are always concealed in the woods there is nothing\r\nto connect the country with the usual feature of Indian woodland scenery.\r\nAnother point most worthy of notice is that the scenery which appears to\r\none seeing it for the first time to be entirely natural, is in reality\r\nvery largely the creation of man. And it has been much improved by his\r\naction for, as you leave Manjarabad to go northwards the jungle becomes\r\ntoo continuous, and it is the same if you go southwards into the adjacent\r\ndistrict of Coorg, and when you compare the last mentioned tracts with\r\nManjarabad you then begin to realize the fact that nature, if left to\r\nherself, is apt to become a trifle monotonous. But in Manjarabad man has\r\ninvaded nature to beautify her and bring her to perfection--cutting down\r\nand turning eventually into stretches of grass much of the original\r\nforest--leaving blocks of from 50 to 200 acres of wood on the margin of\r\neach group of houses, clearing out the jungle in the bottoms for rice\r\ncultivation and thus forming what at some seasons appear to be bright\r\ngreen rivers winding through the forest-clad or wooded slopes, and here\r\nand there planting on the knolls trees of various wide-spreading kinds.\r\nAnd yet from the absence of fences, and of cultivation on the uplands, the\r\nwhole scene appears to be one of Nature's creations, and all the more so\r\nbecause no houses nor farm-buildings are visible, as these are hidden\r\namongst the trees on the margins of the forest lands. Then this long tract\r\nof beautifully wooded and watered country is fringed on its western border\r\nby the varied mountain crests of the Western Ghauts, while on the east it\r\nis traversed by the Hemavati river which is fed by the numerous streams,\r\nand brawling burns which descend from the frontier hills. But though\r\nManjarabad has combinations of charms unrivalled in their kind, we must\r\nnot forget that an examination of of them by no means exhausts the scenery\r\nof the Ghauts, for, on the north-western border of Mysore are the falls of\r\nGairsoppa. Often had I read descriptions of them which I once thought must\r\nhave been too highly coloured, but when I visited the falls some years ago\r\nI found that the accounts I had read were not only far below the reality,\r\nbut that the most important parts of the wonderful combinations of the\r\nscenes had either never been noted, or been quite inadequately recorded.\r\nI do not now profess to give anything approaching an adequate account of\r\nthem. Nor indeed do I think it would be possible to do so. But what\r\nfollows will I think at least be of advantage in directing the attention\r\nof the traveller to the best way of observing the varied scenes, and\r\nnoting the wonderful musical combinations, which are to be heard at these\r\nmarvellously beautiful falls.\r\n\r\nThe falls of Gairsoppa are on the Sarawati, or Arrowborn[6] river, which,\r\nrising in the western woodland region of Northern Mysore, flows north-west\r\nfor about sixty-two miles, and then, turning abruptly to the west,\r\nprecipitates its waters over cliffs about 860 feet in height. When the\r\nriver is at the full in the south-west monsoon an immense body of water\r\nrushes over the precipice, and from calculations made by some engineers,\r\nand which are recorded in the book at the Travellers' Bungalow, the volume\r\nand height of fall at that time, if taken together, would give a force of\r\nwater about equal to that of Niagara. But, however that may be, a glance\r\nat the high water marks, and a knowledge of the immense rainfall on the\r\ncrests of the Ghauts during the monsoon months, makes it certain that, at\r\nthat time of year, the amount of water must be very large. At that season,\r\nthough, the falls are almost invisible, as they are concealed by vast\r\nmasses of mist and spray, and even were they visible, as the water then\r\nstretches from bank to bank, there would only be one vast monotonous fall.\r\nBut after the heavy monsoon floods are over, the river above the\r\nfalls-shrinks back as it were into a long deep pool which lies at a\r\ndistance of several hundred yards from the brink of the precipice, and\r\nfrom this pool the water of the river then escapes by four distinct rapids\r\nwhich have cut their way to-the brink of the precipice, and fall over the\r\ncliffs in four distinct falls, each one of widely different character\r\nfrom the others. The falls at this season are only 834 feet high, but when\r\nthe river rises to the full the fall, as I before mentioned, must be about\r\n860 feet, or approximating in height to the loftiest story of the Eiffel\r\nTower. Across the rapids light bridges of bamboo are thrown, at the end of\r\neach monsoon. There are thus two ways of crossing the river--one by the\r\npool above the falls where there is a ferry-boat which can take over\r\nhorses as well as people--the other by the bridges of the rapids--and it\r\nis necessary to cross the river because the only bungalow is on the north,\r\nor Bombay side of the river, and the best point for seeing the falls is on\r\nthe southern side. The only way too of reaching the bottom of the falls is\r\nby the southern side.\r\n\r\nThe only objection to these falls is the difficulty of getting at them,\r\nowing to their being quite out of the usual travellers' route, and that is\r\nwhy they have, if I may judge by the travellers' book at the bungalow,[7]\r\nbeen, comparatively speaking, rarely visited. Then there is no railway\r\nnearer than about ninety miles, and though the falls are only thirty-five\r\nmiles from the western coast, steamers do not call at the nearest port to\r\nthem. Nor is it at all even probable that any line will ever be brought\r\nnearer to the falls than about sixty miles. It is, too, rather\r\ndiscouraging to have the prospect of a ninety mile road journey to see the\r\nfalls, and then return by the same route. But I would suggest that a\r\ntraveller might make a very enjoyable trip by going from Bombay to Hoobli\r\non the South Maharatta line, and, on the way to Gairsoppa visit the\r\nLushington Falls which are about 400 feet in height, the Lalgali Fall\r\nwhich has a series of picturesque rapids and cascades, with a total fall\r\nof from 200 to 300 feet, and the Majod falls where the Bedti-Gangaveli\r\nriver forms a picturesque waterfall leaping in a series of cascades over\r\ncliffs varying in height from 100 to 200 feet in height, and together 800\r\nfeet high. I have not visited any of these last named falls. An account of\r\nthem and other places of interest in the Kanara district is given in the\r\n\"Bombay Gazetteer\" for Kanara,[8] which gives a complete history of this\r\ninteresting district, and is a book which the traveller should buy, as it\r\nis well worthy of a place in any library. I now proceed to give an account\r\nof my visit to the Gairsoppa Falls.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of January, 1886 (I should not advise the traveller to visit\r\nthe falls earlier than November 1st nor later than the middle of January,\r\nas the water lessens after the latter date), I arrived at the Travellers'\r\nBungalow at the Falls, after having travelled there by the coast route\r\nfrom Bombay, which I found so troublesome that I cannot recommend its\r\nadoption. The bungalow, which is about thirty-five miles from the western\r\ncoast, and on ground 1,800 feet above sea level, is situated in a truly\r\nromantic spot (in fact rather too romantic if we take the possibility of\r\nan earthquake into consideration), for it is close to the edge of a gorge\r\n900 feet deep, and in full view of the face of the precipice over which\r\nthe waters of the Arrowborn river precipitate themselves on their way to\r\nthe western sea. To north, south, east, and west stretch hills and vales\r\nfor the most part covered with the evergreen forest, and only here and\r\nthere showing grassy slopes and summits. On the opposite side of the gorge\r\nas you peer down into it you can see emerging from the edge of the jungle\r\nabout half way down from the top of the side of the gorge what looks like\r\na long ladder of stone, but which really consists of the rough steps by\r\nwhich alone the bottom of the falls can be reached.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I proceeded to cross the river by the bridges\r\nover the rapids. The first rapid is that of the Rajah Fall, the water of\r\nwhich shoots sheer from the cliff, and, without even touching a rock,\r\nfalls 830 feet into a pool 132 feet deep. After crossing the bridge you\r\nsometimes walk through, and sometimes clamber over, the vast assemblage of\r\nrocks and huge boulders which form the bed of the river, and are deeply\r\nsubmerged when the river is full. The sight here is extremely curious and\r\ninteresting as, after leaving the bridge of the Rajah rapid, there are\r\nabout 1,000 feet of rock and boulders to pass through or over before you\r\nreach the next rapid, and, when half way, there would be nothing to show\r\nthat you were not wandering through a mere wilderness of rocks were it not\r\nfor the unceasing thunder, far below, from the bottom of the Rajah Fall.\r\nThe next rapid to be crossed is that of the Roarer, which takes, before it\r\ngoes over the precipice a most singular course--first flowing into a basin\r\nat the edge of the cliff, and then leaving this in a northerly direction,\r\nafter which it rushes down a steep stony trough to fall into the same deep\r\npool which receives the water of the Rajah Fall. After crossing the bridge\r\nof the Roarer rapid the bed of the river has again to be traversed and at\r\na distance of about 700 feet you reach the rapid of the Rocket. This is a\r\nfall of wonderful beauty, for the water projects itself sheer from the\r\ncliff to fall about 100 feet on to a vast projecting piece, or rather\r\nbuttress of rock, which causes the water to shoot out into a rocket-like\r\ncourse from which are thrown off wonderfully beautiful jets, and arrowy\r\nshoots of water, and spray, and foam, which seem to resemble falling stars\r\nor shooting meteors. You then pass over another section of the river bed\r\nfor about 500 feet till you reach the rapid, or rather stream, of the la\r\nDame Blanche Fall which glides gently over the precipice in a broad\r\nfoaming silvery sheet. From the first rapid to the last the distance is\r\nabout 733 yards. I have met with no estimate of the total width of the\r\nfall when the river is in full flood, but it can hardly be less than half\r\na mile wide, and the depth of the water, as one can see from the high\r\nwater mark, must be very great. It is interesting to note on the tops of\r\nthe boulders here and there the circular stones that have, during each\r\nmonsoon, been whirling round and round, each one in its own pothole.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the last bridge you then walk over the rocks into the\r\nforest beyond and strike the path which leads down through the forest on\r\nthe Mysore side of the river, to a point called Watkin's platform--an\r\nopen-sided shed about 100 feet below the top of the falls, and which\r\ncommands a view of the gorge below the falls, and a fair, though rather\r\ndistant view of the falls. When approaching the platform I was positively\r\nstartled by a vast shrieking clang which suddenly burst on the ear and\r\nseemed to fill the air. This I afterwards found had come from the\r\nsemi-cavernous gorge of rock about half a mile away, into which fall the\r\nwaters of the Rajah and Roarer rapids, and though I afterwards heard\r\nsomewhat similar sounds issuing from these falls, I never heard again\r\nanything approaching to this singular and startling burst of sound. These\r\nsounds have often been remarked upon, but no one seems to have attempted\r\nto trace their cause, but they most probably arise from the escape of air\r\nwhich has been driven by the falling waters into some deep fissures of the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nHaving thus taken a general view of the situation, I then returned to the\r\nbungalow for breakfast, and in the afternoon at about two o'clock returned\r\nto Watkin's platform by the route of the ferry across the pool, and, with\r\nmy companion, set out for the foot of the falls, first of all by a steep\r\nwinding path, and then by a flight of very rough and uneven steps which\r\nhad been formed by placing stones in places on and between the rocks. When\r\ndescending, we often paused to view the constantly changing scene, for,\r\nas we got lower and lower, the rainbow hues across each fall, which were\r\nat first widely broken by the masses of cliff stretching between the\r\nfalls, came closer and closer, till at last, when we reached the region\r\nwhere the spray of all the falls was mingled, the iris hues stretched\r\nacross the gorge in an unbroken band of colour. At length, as we neared\r\nthe foot of the fall, we reached a small open-sided shed, which had\r\nrecently been erected on the occasion of the Maharajah of Mysore's visit.\r\nFrom this, which was probably fifty feet from the bottom of the gorge and\r\nabout 100 yards from the falls, an admirable view was obtained of the\r\nentire situation, and we began to realize how impossible it is to form any\r\nadequate conception of the falls from the top, or from the higher sides of\r\nthe gorge. We next descended to the bottom of the gorge, where the ground\r\nis strewn with vast boulders of rock, which had evidently fallen from the\r\ncliff as it had been eaten back by waters toiling through countless bygone\r\nages. Many of these masses of rock lie at some distance from the foot of\r\nthe falls, and on the partially decayed surfaces of some of them\r\nvegetation had evidently been flourishing for an indefinite period of\r\ntime. Huge masses of rocks and boulders, as you look down the river, seem\r\nalmost to block up its route towards the western sea, and indeed so\r\ncompletely seem to fill up the pass, that one seemed to be standing at the\r\nbottom of a rock-bound hollow which had been excavated by the agency of\r\nNature, after a toil through periods of time far beyond the calculations\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nAs I found that the rocks at the foot of the falls were covered with a\r\nslimy mud, and as I was suffering slightly from a damaged foot, I\r\npresently returned to the shed, while my companion proceeded to explore\r\nthe bed of the gorge further down the river. The floor of the shed had\r\nbeen strewed with straw, and I lay down at full length, partly to rest\r\nand partly to examine the situation more minutely, for the height is so\r\ngreat that it is impossible adequately to survey the scene in any other\r\nposition. And then, when you have stillness and solitude, and when the\r\nbody is in complete repose, there pour in on eye and ear floods of\r\nimpressions so quickly varying that the mind feels quite unable to record\r\nthem, and there is finally nothing left behind but a vague and\r\nindescribable sensation of all that is grand and beautiful and melodious\r\nin nature. For there are vast heights and gloomy depths and recesses, and\r\nvaried forms of falling waters, and in the general surroundings everything\r\nto convey exalted ideas of grandeur to the mind, but grandeur accompanied\r\nby exquisite beauty, in colour, in the graceful movement of animal life,\r\nand in the varying sounds of falling waters--the charm of the iris hues\r\nwhich ever beautify the falling waters--beauty in the varied colours of\r\nthe rocks, and in the plants and ferns growing in the fissures of the\r\ncliff--beauty in exquisite forms of motion--of water varied in countless\r\nways as it descends from the four separate falls--beauty in the unceasing\r\nmovements of countless swallows, mingled here and there with specimens of\r\nthe Alpine swift and the pretty blue-hued rock pigeons, which build their\r\nnests on the ledges of the cliffs, and are constantly to be seen flying\r\nacross the falls. Then there are the unceasing and ever varying sounds of\r\nfalling waters, grand in their totality, grand and melodious in their\r\nseparate cadences--the deep bass of the Rajah, sometimes like cannon\r\nthundering in the distance, and sometimes like the regular tolling of some\r\nvast Titanic bell; sounds of most varied and brilliant music from the\r\nRocket; the jagged note of the Roarer, as its waters rush down their\r\nsteep, stony trough; the eerie and mysterious sounds which, sometimes like\r\na mingling of startling shrieks and clangs, and sometimes, to the active\r\nimagination, like the far-off lamentations of imprisoned spirits,[9]\r\noccasionally rise from the semi-cavernous chasm which has been hollowed\r\nout behind the great pool beneath the cliff; the gentle murmuring note of\r\nthe White Lady Fall, tangled threads of sound from which fall in fitful\r\ncadences on the ear as the wind rises and falls athwart the falls; and\r\nlastly, but by no means leastly, the undulating and endless varieties of\r\nsounds which, having broken away from their original source, are ever\r\nwandering and echoing around the rock-bound gorge. Beautiful indeed and\r\naltogether indescribable are the elements of melody which are created by\r\nthe falling waters of the Arrowborn river!\r\n\r\nAnd the music, too, seemed to be for ever varying, for the choral odes\r\nwhich were sweetly chanted to the ear were not perpetually continuous, and\r\nat times, owing to some change in the direction of the wind as it swirled\r\naround the gorge, the choral element was subordinated to the deep thunder\r\nof the Rajah Fall, or the vague tumult of startling discords which arose\r\nat intervals from the semi-cavernous walls of the pool into which plunge\r\nthe waters of the Rajah and Roarer Falls. And then these sounds would\r\ngradually lose their predominance, and the more uniform sounds in which\r\nall the four falls joined would once more fill the air and charm the ear.\r\nAnd thus the attention could never be lulled to sleep, for here monotony\r\nwas not, and the mind was always kept in an attitude of expectancy for the\r\nvariations in the music which were sure to come, and, so far as they\r\nreached the ear, were never the same combinations of sounds that had been\r\nheard before. All the elements of melody were here, indeed, in profuse\r\nabundance, and it seemed as if they only required to be caught by some\r\nmaster hand and strung into methodical musical combinations to yield to\r\nthe mind and feelings those exquisite sensations which music alone can in\r\nany effective degree convey.\r\n\r\nAnd besides the effects we have noticed, there is the motion of colour\r\nconstantly, though gradually, shifting and altering, for, as the sun\r\ndeclines, the rainbow hues move steadily upwards on the face of the falls,\r\nand the colours of the rocks, which are of varying shades of purple and\r\nyellow, continually alter in character with the sinking day. But the\r\nfinest combined effects of beauty and grandeur are, perhaps, most fully\r\nfelt when, late in the afternoon, the eye wanders delighted over the vast\r\ncombination of lofty cliffs and falling waters to rest finally far above\r\non the iris tints of the Rajah and Roarer Falls, through the colours of\r\nwhich myriads of swallows incessantly wheel on lightsome wing, mingled\r\nwith the quick, darting movement of the Alpine swifts, and the gentle\r\nflight of the blue rock pigeons, which occasionally wing their way through\r\nthe mazy throng. For there the eye is ever delighted with the charm of\r\ncolour and of those endless variations of graceful movement which\r\ncontinuously convey pleasurable sensations to the mind. But how could eye\r\nor ear ever tire of those rare combinations of form, colour, motion and\r\nrhythmic sounds which fill the mind with an exalted sense of feeling and\r\nof pleasure, and the conscious heart with exquisite sensations far beyond\r\nthe power of language to describe?\r\n\r\nPresently my companion returned and aroused me from my state of dreamy\r\npleasure, and I turned reluctantly away from the scene as the rainbow\r\ncolours were, with the sinking sun, beginning to disappear from the\r\ntopmost heights of the falls.\r\n\r\nDelightful indeed were the brilliant and varied scenes I have been\r\nattempting to describe, and after them the remainder was by comparison\r\ntame, but still I found that, as I took a canoe the following evening and\r\nrowed up the forest-margined pool from which the rapids emerge, that the\r\nminor scenes at the falls have exquisite charms of their own. And then it\r\nwas that I realized that, varying though the scale may be, there is\r\neverywhere about the falls the same beauty of detail and beauty of\r\ncombined effect, and that, too, unaccompanied by a single jarring note.\r\nFor nowhere can you say, as you can often say in viewing scenes elsewhere,\r\n\"leave out this, or alter that, and the scene would be perfect,\" and in\r\nnone of the scenes about the falls does anything poor, or base, or mean,\r\nor uninteresting strike the eye, and as I rowed slowly up the pool I felt\r\nthat the mind was both charmed and soothed by the exquisite repose of the\r\nscene, which is only broken, if indeed it can be said to be broken, by the\r\nbeautiful birds and gaily painted kingfishers which occasionally wing\r\ntheir way across the water, or flit along the margin of the forest-clad\r\nshore. As you look towards the West the eye wanders over the wild\r\nassemblage of water-worn rocks and boulders which intervene between the\r\npool and the head of the falls, to rest finally on the distant hills,\r\ncovered mostly to their tips with the evergreen forest, while on looking\r\nup the river you see that it is flanked by woods on either hand, and as\r\nyou lose sight of the water as it bends towards the south, the eye glances\r\nupwards to hills of moderate height, wooded in the hollows, and showing on\r\nthe ridges grassy vistas dotted with occasional trees.\r\n\r\nOn returning, I went lower down in the pool than the point I had started\r\nat, and passed a number of rocks worn into all sorts of curious shapes,\r\nand one of these leaned, like some gigantic Saurian, over the flood. As we\r\nneared the rapids, one felt that one would by no means like to run any\r\nrisk of being drawn into one of them, and I was by no means anxious to go\r\nnearer to them than the boatmen, wished. One of them told me that the\r\nnatives sometimes descended the cliffs between the Roarer and the Rocket\r\nFalls in order to carry off the fledglings from the nests of the blue rock\r\npigeons, and said that several lives had thus been lost. He said that\r\nthere was no way of reaching the bottom of the cliff, and rather quaintly\r\nadded, \"Those who came up again came up, and those who did not, died.\" He\r\nsaid that some European had once put what was evidently dynamite into the\r\npool. A great explosion followed, which killed a large number of fish,\r\nmany of which were washed over the falls.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I sat for a long time in the bungalow veranda smoking my\r\ncigar, and looking dreamily out at the moonlit falls, and observing from\r\ntime to time the scenic changes that were produced by the great masses of\r\nmist which drifted up the gorge below me to be dispersed as they touched\r\nthe cliffs, and presenting, as they did so, most charming pictures. In the\r\nmorning, too, beautiful effects were to be seen, as masses of mist arose\r\nfrom the chasm of the Rajah to flit in fleecy fragments across the face of\r\nthe falls. But the scenes about this spot are of endless variety, and I\r\nmust allow myself to mention only one more, which my companion saw one\r\nmorning from Watkin's platform when the iris hues were on the pool below\r\nthe falls, which, as the spray fell into it, seemed like a mass of golden\r\nwater dotted all over, as if yellow tinted rain were falling into it. On\r\nsome occasions visitors have illuminated the falls with fireworks, and by\r\nfloating over the falls ignited bundles of straw soaked in paraffin, and I\r\nregret that I had not thought of following their example.\r\n\r\nNext morning I set out on a drive of about 150 miles to my plantations in\r\nManjarabad. As we left the falls, we passed, and close to the river pool\r\nabove them, a tree covered with fruit which was being eaten by green\r\npigeons and other birds, and on looking up into it I was surprised, as it\r\nis an animal of nocturnal habits, to see a large and beautiful flying\r\nsquirrel peering at me with a quiet but by no means apprehensive eye. I\r\nwas strongly tempted to shoot it for the sake of its skin, but my\r\ncompanion, who had been much affected by the beauties of the falls, said\r\nthat it would be a sacrilege to shoot anything so near them. So I spared\r\nhis feelings and the poor squirrel, and am now very glad to think that I\r\ndid so. I may here mention that the traveller, though he sets out early in\r\nthe morning and late in the afternoon, very rarely sees anything in the\r\nshape of big game, even though the jungles he may be driving through may\r\nabound with it, and the sole exception I can remember, after numerous\r\njourneys through them, occurred on the occasion of my drive home from the\r\nfalls, when, early one morning, a tiger bounded across the road at a\r\ndistance of about 100 yards ahead. It is also worthy of remark that you\r\nvery seldom see a snake, and, though I landed on the Western coast at\r\nCarwar and travelled by easy stages by way of the falls to my estate, I\r\ndid not see a single snake during the whole course of the journey.\r\n\r\nAs it is probable that this account of the Gairsoppa Falls may induce\r\ntravellers to visit them, I think it may be useful to give an account of\r\nthe Cauvery Falls on the southern frontier of Mysore, which are well\r\nworthy of a visit, and easily accessible. The best time for visiting them\r\nis generally said to be August, or not later than the middle of September,\r\nthough when I visited them on the 25th of that month last year, the river,\r\nthough not in full flood, had an ample supply of water in it, and, from\r\nMr. Bowring's description of his visit to them on November 21st,[10] there\r\nmust still, up to that date, be a considerable flow in the river. From my\r\nown experience, I feel sure that the best time to see these falls is after\r\nthe great floods have subsided, as the water then is clear, or nearly so,\r\nand the effects, as in the case of the Gairsoppa Falls, are far more\r\nvaried and brilliant. There is one point I would here particularly impress\r\non the traveller, and that is, that when visiting falls such as those of\r\nGairsoppa and the Cauvery, which present a great variety of scenic\r\neffects, and are not merely monotonous single masses of water, he should\r\ndevote at least two clear days to them, i.e., he should arrive on one\r\nday, remain two days, and leave on the fourth day. He should also select a\r\ntime when there is a sufficiency of moonlight. I was particularly\r\nimpressed with the first point, because I most thoroughly enjoyed my visit\r\nto Gairsoppa as I had two clear days there, whereas my visit to the\r\nCauvery Falls was attended with that sense of hurry which, if not\r\ndestructive of all enjoyment, leaves behind on the mind a feeling that\r\nmany points in the scenes must have been either missed or quite\r\ninadequately observed. The account of my visit to these falls, however,\r\nmay at least be useful in showing a traveller short of time how to visit\r\nthem with the least possible expenditure of it.\r\n\r\nI left Bangalore, then, on the morning of Thursday, September 24th, 1891,\r\nby the 8.20 a.m. train, for the Mudoor Railway Station, on the lino to\r\nMysore city, and arrived there shortly after midday. I then had luncheon\r\nat the station, and left for the Malvalli Travellers' Bungalow at a little\r\nbefore three, in a carriage I had sent on from Bangalore with two pairs of\r\nhorses (it is advisable to have an extra pair posted), and arrived at my\r\ndestination shortly after five. To this bungalow, which is about fourteen\r\nmiles from the falls, I had previously sent on with my native servants\r\nbedding and mosquito curtains, and the means necessary to prepare meals\r\nfor the party. Reports had reached us of creeping things being abroad in\r\nthis bungalow, and my servant had been particularly enjoined to look out\r\nfor, and, as far as possible, guard against them. This he had done by\r\nputting the bedsteads in the sun and doing what further he could. But\r\nnotwithstanding his assurances of safety, one of the ladies of the party\r\ninsisted that, from all she had heard, there must be creeping things\r\nsomewhere about. The servant listened with an air of respectful attention\r\nto all she had to say, and, when she had quite done, said with quiet\r\npersistence, and much to our amusement, \"What Missus says is true, but\r\nthere are no bugs,\" and I am glad to say that he was justified in making\r\nthe assertion. We rose very early the following morning, started at 4.20,\r\nat 6.20 arrived at the bungalow near the falls, and, after a little delay\r\nto get a cup of tea, drove at once to the nearest fall. But I must here\r\npause for a few moments to describe the general situation of the river,\r\nthe islands formed by its splitting into two distinct branches, and the\r\nposition of the fall--a total situation which is not easily comprehended\r\nwithout the aid of a map.\r\n\r\nThe Cauvery Falls are on the river of that name, which rises in Coorg,\r\nand, after a run of 646 miles to the south-east, falls into the Bay of\r\nBengal about midway between Madras and Cape Comorin. Before reaching\r\nSeringapatam (which is on an island in the river) it is joined by the\r\nHemavati which rises to the north of Manjarabad and, as we have seen,\r\nskirts the eastern border of that talook, or county. As the Hemavati sends\r\ndown a large body of water the source of which is more distant from the\r\nsea than the spot in Coorg which is called the head of the Cauvery, I may\r\nremark in passing that it is singular that the latter should have been\r\nregarded as the source of this fine river, which really rises in Mysore.\r\nBut, rise where it may, it at last arrives at a point on the southern\r\nfrontier of Mysore where the bed of the Cauvery splits into two channels\r\nand forms the island of Hegora, which is about three miles long, and from\r\na quarter of a mile to a mile wide, and, by a rather curious, coincidence,\r\nalmost exactly the size of the island on which the fortress of\r\nSeringapatam has been built. The northern branch of the river washes the\r\nMysore frontier and this, after about two miles, again divides, or rather\r\na small branch diverges to the north and, forming a loop, cuts away from\r\nthe mainland the island of Ettikoor, and there falls into the northern\r\nbranch of the river by various cascades, and just below the point where\r\nthe falls on the main northern branch occur. This group of falls is called\r\nGangana Chuckee.\r\n\r\nThe southern branch of the river on the Madras side flows as a single\r\nstream for about half a mile, and then splits off some of its water into\r\nvarious channels, but forming nothing worthy of the name of an island till\r\nit severs from the mainland the island of Hegora, a strip of land about\r\ntwo furlongs at the widest, and less than a mile in length. To the south\r\nof this the main body of the water goes to form lower down the fine series\r\nof cascades and falls called the Bar Chuckee, while a comparatively small\r\nbody of water goes to the left to form the pretty series of cascades and\r\nsteep runnels of water which fall, though at a different point of the\r\ncompass from the main falls, into the wide pool at the foot of the Bar\r\nChuckee Falls. After this necessary digression I now proceed to narrate\r\nwhat I saw and did.\r\n\r\nI drove, then, after a short delay at the bungalow, to the Gangana Chuckee\r\nFalls, passing on the way the temple of Sivasamudrum, and various\r\nbuildings connected with it, and leaving the carriage, walked down towards\r\nthe falls, passing on the right Pir's Tomb, the grave of a Mahometan\r\npriest of that name, and went to a point just below it, from which a fine\r\ngeneral view of these falls and the river can be obtained. Glancing\r\nupwards, the view of the river, as the waters race down their steep stony\r\nbed towards the falls amidst numerous projecting rocks, is extremely grand\r\nand picturesque. Then at a point just below the spot I was standing on,\r\nthe water plunged down a nearly precipitous descent, from which it\r\napparently (for the spray prevented one seeing exactly) fell\r\nperpendicularly into the pool below, sending up as it did so gossamer\r\nveils of spray full of fleeting, faint, and ever varying iris hues. This\r\npool is flanked, and probably about 100 yards below the foot of the\r\npreviously mentioned fall, on the northern side by a precipice about 250\r\nfeet high, down which, in four separate cascades, falls the water of the\r\nbranch of the river which cuts off the small island of Ettikoor. On the\r\nside of the precipice next to the great fall of the main river stands a\r\npiece of tree-clad rocky ground, apparently about 50 feet higher than the\r\nprecipice, and this is flanked by a rapid at the top, passing into a\r\ncascade lower down, which then held but little water, but which in floods\r\nmust add much to the beauty of the scene. After viewing the scene for\r\nsometime, I returned to the carriage, and drove across the island to visit\r\nthe Bar Chuckee Falls, and left the carriage at a point where the road\r\nbegins to descend into the valley into which the southern branch of the\r\nriver precipitates itself. I then advanced to a point on the right of the\r\nroad from which a fine general view can be obtained, though it is rather\r\ntoo distant as regards the main body of the falls, and, as I reached the\r\npoint in question, came suddenly into view of such a number of separate\r\nfalls and cascades that a description of them is extremely difficult. For,\r\non the opposite side of the valley, I counted no less than thirteen, which\r\nleap partly over one side of a horseshoe shaped precipice which had\r\nevidently, from the huge boulders in the channel below, been eaten back\r\ninto the side of the precipice, and partly shoot out through various\r\nhidden channels which the waters have deeply cut through a huge\r\nsemicircular platform of rock which overhangs the valley below. As they\r\nthus shoot out the effect is extremely striking and picturesque, and their\r\nresemblance to the spokes of light from a star no doubt caused the natives\r\nto give the very appropriate name of Chuckee (pronounced\r\nChickee--Kanarese for star) to these beautiful falls. This semicircular\r\nplatform of rock stands on one side of the river-bed, next to this we have\r\nthe horseshoe-shaped precipice I have mentioned, and next to that again,\r\nas it were by way of quietly beautiful contrast, there is a vast sheet of\r\nsteeply sloping rock, which is completely covered by a thin coating of\r\nwhite, and everywhere foaming water. When the river is at the full this\r\nfine series of falls and cascades vanishes, and is replaced, as in the\r\ncase of the falls at Gairsoppa, by one great fall about half a mile wide.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at this beautiful scene, the eye wanders next over some\r\njungle-clad slopes on the western side of the main falls, to dwell on a\r\nseries of cascades and racing waters which descend through channels\r\nflanked on either side by scrubby plants and trees--a series which arises\r\nfrom a branch which diverges about a mile higher up the river, and the\r\ncascades and runnels of water of which are scattered round precipitous\r\nslopes right up to, and immediately below, the point on which I was\r\nstanding. All the falls and cascades unite in a pool below of great width,\r\nfrom which the water escapes through a narrow gorge, to join, further\r\ndown, the river branch on which are the Gangana Chuckee Falls. The general\r\neffect here appears to be that you are looking at falls and cascades\r\nproceeding from two different rivers, the one flowing from the south and\r\nthe other from the west, and the effect is the same at the first described\r\nfalls. The general height of all the falls is said to be from 200 to 250\r\nfeet, and in Mr. Bowring's \"Eastern Experiences\" 300 feet, but I can find\r\nno account, and could hear of no particulars, as to when or how\r\nmeasurements were taken, as in the case of the falls at Gairsoppa, which\r\nwere carefully surveyed by officers of the Indian Navy. I was particularly\r\nstruck with the absence of bird life at these falls, and only saw two\r\nsmall birds, and one hawk, and a small flight of what in the distance\r\nappeared to be pigeons, which alit on a rock at the foot of one of the\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to refrain from contrasting these falls with those at\r\nGairsoppa. The Cauvery Falls have indeed much beauty and grandeur in\r\nriver, and varied waterfall scenery, and had I not seen the Gairsoppa\r\nFalls I should have thought that it would have been difficult to find\r\nanywhere in the world scenes more varied and beautiful. But the beauties\r\nof the falls of Cauvery are set in comparatively speaking sterile\r\nsurroundings of rock and scrubby jungle, trees and shrubs scattered over\r\nground partly undulating, and partly over hills of moderate height and\r\nuninteresting form. Then the grandeur arising from their great height, and\r\nthe charms of the varied sounds of the falls of Gairsoppa, and the\r\nmarvellously beautiful effects of graceful bird life wheeling and darting\r\namidst the iris hues of the falls, and the setting of the whole scene\r\namidst the tropical wealth of the evergreen forest of the Western Ghauts,\r\nafford combinations which far exceed those of the Cauvery Falls. I have no\r\nhesitation in saying, as a traveller to the falls of Gairsoppa has said\r\nbefore, that they alone would repay one for all the trouble of the voyage\r\nto India. But, beautiful and grand as they undoubtedly are, I cannot quite\r\nsay the same of the Cauvery falls, though I can with confidence say that\r\nif the traveller leaves India without seeing them he will certainly have\r\nmissed one of the scenes best worth seeing in it.\r\n\r\nAfter spending some time at the Bar Chuckee Falls I then drove back to the\r\nbungalow and, leaving the carriage there, walked rather more than half a\r\nmile to the bridge which connects the island with the Madras side of the\r\nriver, and which I closely examined, as it is a most curious and\r\ninteresting specimen of the work of native engineers, and as it has\r\nwithstood the floods of about seventy years, one of which passed over the\r\nroadway of the bridge to a depth of three feet, is most highly creditable\r\nto native workmanship. A similar bridge connects the island with the\r\nMysore side of the river, and both bridges were repaired at his own cost\r\nby a native in the employ of the Mysore Government, who in recognition of\r\nthis important work, received from the British Government, for himself and\r\nhis heirs (who are bound to keep up the bridges) land yielding an annual\r\nrevenue of £800, and of £900 from the Mysore Government.\r\n\r\nThe bridge I now proceeded to examine. It is built entirely of stone\r\nwithout any mortar or cement, and is supported on two rows of single block\r\nstone pillars standing on slabs of stone placed on the river bed. Those\r\npillars are about nine feet high and eight feet apart. On the top of each\r\npillar is first of all a thick block of stone projecting about eighteen\r\ninches from the pillar on its upper and lower sides. Then on this was a\r\nrather thicker block of stone, and on the top of all cross beams of solid\r\nsingle stones had been laid, and from one cross beam to another were solid\r\nand closely put together slabs of stones, some of which were eighteen\r\ninches wide, and some rather wider, thus making a roadway above so narrow\r\nthat two carriages cannot pass each other. In order to strengthen the\r\npillars and keep them in position, a flat slab of stone had been laid on\r\nthe bed of the river, from the base of the lower pillar to within about\r\ntwo feet of the upper one, and between the end of this slab and the pillar\r\na thick, high block of stone had been wedged. In this bridge there were\r\n109 pairs of pillars, giving a total length of about 1,000 feet. I was\r\nstruck with the difference in the age of the pillars, and with the fact\r\nthat, whereas some were plain, roughly hewn pillars, others, which had\r\nbeen dressed and chiselled into various forms, were evidently of great\r\nantiquity, and I was subsequently informed by the clerk of the proprietor\r\nof the island that the latter had been procured from ruined temples in\r\nthe neighbourhood. These bridges at first sight seem to be curved in a\r\nslight loop up the stream, but a closer examination shows that they have\r\nbeen built in several lines, first slightly up the stream and then\r\nadvancing by several straight lines to a blunt arrow-like point in the\r\ncentre of the river, and this was evidently to enable the bridges the\r\nbetter to resist the heavy floods, one of which, as I have previously\r\nmentioned, went no less than three feet over the roadway. As you stand on\r\nthe edge of the river and look along the centre of the rows of pillars the\r\neffect is very curious, as they then present the appearance of a long\r\ncolonnade of pillars of various shapes, with a flat roof of solid slabs of\r\nstone overhead.\r\n\r\nAfter thoroughly inspecting the bridge, I lay for some time in the shade\r\nof a tree which stood on the bank of the river about fifty yards below the\r\nbridge, and awaited the arrival of the carriage, which I had sent for as\r\nthe day was getting hot, and as I thus lay languidly observing the long\r\ncolonnade, and the water which rapidly flowed between the pillars, and\r\nlooked up the river as it stretched away to the north-west, and enjoyed\r\nthe cool air which gently moved along the water, I felt a quiet sense of\r\nenjoyment which gave me a greater, and certainly a more lasting, sense of\r\npleasure than I had experienced when visiting the beautiful falls I have\r\njust endeavoured to describe. I mention this for the moral, which is, that\r\nto enjoy scenery the body must be comfortable and in complete repose. I\r\nwould also add that you must be alone, or practically alone, by being out\r\nof sight or hearing of your companions. Presently I was aroused by the\r\nrumble of the carriage, and, collecting my party, returned to the bungalow\r\nfor luncheon. At about half past four the carriage was brought round, and\r\nwe drove to our temporary home to dinner, and on the following day reached\r\nBangalore at two o'clock, the whole trip having thus occupied about sixty\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] No less than 291.53 inches fell this year, between April and the last\r\nday of September, at a Cardamom plantation on the crests of the Ghauts.\r\n\r\n[5] After the fall of Seringapatam some further military operations were\r\nnecessary in Manjarabad, and some of Colonel Wellesley's letters were\r\nwritten within a few miles of my bungalow.\r\n\r\n[6] So called from its flowing from a source which was supposed to have\r\nbeen formed by a stroke of Rama's arrow.\r\n\r\n[7] All travellers are obliged to record their names in these books, and\r\nstate the time they have stayed, and the sums they have paid for the use\r\nof the bungalow.\r\n\r\n[8] \"Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency,\" vol. xv.

Before visiting Mysore the traveller should certainly buy or\r\nconsult this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMYSORE--ITS HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, AND REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my last chapter I gave a description of Mysore and its waterfalls. In\r\nthe present chapter I purpose very briefly remarking on its history,\r\ngovernment, and representative assembly, and shall conclude by contrasting\r\nthe last with the so-called National Indian Congress.\r\n\r\nIn his Report of December, 1804, the Acting Resident of Mysore, Colonel\r\nMark Wilks, observed that \"the territories composing the present dominion\r\nof His Highness the Rajah of Mysore had, from the remotest periods of\r\ntradition, been held by a number of polygars and petty Rajahs, whose\r\npossessions were incessantly enlarged, diminished, or alienated, by a\r\nseries of revolutions which it would perhaps be impossible to trace, and\r\nunprofitable to describe,\" and it is interesting to note how little, at\r\nthat time, seems to have been known about the history of the kingdoms we\r\nconquered. But all doubts as to the early history of Mysore have now been\r\nremoved, and the reader will find in Mr. Rice's admirable gazetteer of\r\nMysore a minute history of the country accompanied by coloured maps which\r\nshow at a glance the numerous transitions which the territories now\r\ncomprised under the head of Mysore have undergone in former times, but as\r\nI think that it would certainly be unprofitable to describe these\r\ntransitions here I shall content myself with a bare enumeration of those\r\nleading facts which are necessary for a general comprehension of the\r\nsituation. All, then, that the reader requires to know is, that a line of\r\nHindoo Rajahs which once reigned over a very limited portion of Mysore\r\ngradually acquired about half of it; that a descendant of their line was\r\nset aside by the Mahometan usurper Hyder Ali (an able soldier of fortune,\r\nwho had risen to the chief command of the army); that he conquered the\r\nremainder of the present territory and ruled it from 1761 to 1782; and\r\nthat after his death he was succeeded by his son Sultan Tippoo, who on May\r\n4th, 1799, lost his life at Seringapatam, and with it all the territories\r\nacquired by his father, thereby fulfilling what Hyder Ali said when he\r\nobserved to his son one day, \"I was born to win and you were born to lose\r\nan empire.\" The subsequent history of the province is soon told. After the\r\nfall of Seringapatam it was resolved to place a descendant of the old\r\nHindoo line on the throne, and Krishna Rajah Wodeyar--then about five\r\nyears old, became Maharajah of Mysore, with Purnaiya (formerly prime\r\nminister of Tippoo) as Dewan and Regent, and Colonel (afterwards Sir\r\nBarry) Close as Resident, while Colonel Arthur Wellesley (afterwards Duke\r\nof Wellington) commanded the division. Under the new Government all at\r\nfirst went well, and in 1804 the Governor-General declared that during the\r\npast five years \"the affairs of the Government of Mysore had been\r\nconducted with a degree of regularity, wisdom, discretion and justice\r\nunparalleled in any native state in India.\" But, unfortunately for himself\r\nand his subjects, the Maharajah, in 1811, began to rule, and Purnaiya, the\r\nable prime minister, retired, and soon afterwards died. Then followed a\r\nlong period of misgovernment, which culminated in the insurrection of\r\n1830, to put down which the aid of British troops had to be called in. A\r\nformal inquiry was then made by the British Government, and the result of\r\nthis was that it was determined to transfer the entire administration to\r\nBritish officers, and put the Maharajah on an allowance for his personal\r\nexpenditure. At first two commissioners were appointed to administer the\r\ngovernment, but this was found to be inconvenient, and in April, 1834,\r\nColonel (afterwards Sir Mark) Cubbon was appointed as sole commissioner\r\nfor the province. He occupied the post till February, 1861, when he\r\nretired, and when on his way home died at Suez at about seventy-seven\r\nyears of age, having spent the whole of the previous years of the century\r\nin India. He was succeeded by other able commissioners, and nothing of any\r\npolitical importance happened in the province till June, 1865, when the\r\nMaharajah adopted as his heir a scion of one of the leading families of\r\nhis house. It was for some time doubtful whether the Government would\r\nrecognize the adoption, as, after the death of the Maharajah, it had been\r\ngenerally assumed that the province would be annexed, but in April, 1867,\r\nthe Home Government decided that it should be recognized, and on September\r\n23rd, 1868, six months after the death of Krishna Rajah, his adopted son,\r\nChama Rajendra Wodeyar Bahadur, at that time between five and six years\r\nold, was duly installed at Mysore, and it was then decided that the\r\ncountry should remain under British administration till the Maharajah came\r\nof age. His Highness attained his majority at the age of eighteen, on the\r\n5th of March, 1881, and was formally installed on the throne on the 25th\r\nof that month, and thus the province, after having been directly\r\nadministered by the British for almost exactly fifty years, was handed\r\nover, not as we shall afterwards see, to native rule, but to native\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nAnd here a rather interesting question naturally arises. How was such a\r\nchange--one quite unique in the history of India--received by the\r\ninhabitants of the country? So far as the planters (of whom I am one of\r\nthe oldest, having settled in the province in 1855) are concerned, I do\r\nnot think they have been in the slightest degree affected. They were all\r\nwell satisfied with the English administration, and I think they are\r\nequally well satisfied with the present native administration. In fact,\r\nthere is no change perceptible, except that the criminal administration,\r\nhas somewhat fallen off, and it certainly has been occasionally found that\r\nan answer from a native official sometimes resembles death--you think it\r\nis never coming and then it comes when least expected. But I must confess\r\nthat, as regards answers to communications, I have heard of similar\r\ncomplaints made by the former Mysore Government against the Supreme\r\nGovernment, and of a like complaint made by the latter against the Home\r\nGovernment. But, though the change was regarded with indifference by the\r\nsettlers in the province, and was indeed of obvious advantage to them, as\r\nthere is no income-tax, and the finances are flourishing, it was not at\r\nall acceptable to the native population in general, and the native\r\nofficials were quite aware that the new administration was not popular. I\r\nmade frequent inquiries as to the cause of this, not only from natives in\r\nmy own neighbourhood, but from those I met when travelling by easy stages\r\nfrom the Gairsoppa Falls in the north-western corner of the province to my\r\nestates in Southern Mysore, and found that the universal complaint was\r\nthat there was a want of Daryápti, or active inquiry into grievances, and\r\none of my old native neighbours was loud in his praises of the palmy days\r\nof Sir Mark Cubbon. I confess, however, that though there may have been\r\nsome grounds for complaint as regards \"inquiry,\" owing to the greater zeal\r\nand personal activity of Englishmen, I do not think that there were any\r\nreal grounds for dissatisfaction, and feel sure that the unpopularity of\r\nthe new administration was owing partly to the fact of the country, at the\r\ntime of the rendition, not being in a very prosperous condition, partly to\r\nthe strong conservative instincts of the natives, and partly, perhaps, to\r\ntheir being under some apprehension that the abuses of the old native\r\ngovernment might possibly be revived. But, however that may be, from\r\ninquiries made when last in India, and especially from the absence of any\r\nreference to the subject in the many conversations I had with natives of\r\nall classes, I believe that the unpopularity of the new administration,\r\nwhich at first undoubtedly existed, has now quite passed away.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to mention here that, though the administration is now a\r\nnative one, there are still, in the Mysore service, about thirty-five\r\nEnglishmen in the various departments of the State, and that the most\r\nfriendly relations exist between them and the native officials. I feel\r\nsure, too, that the value of an admixture of Englishmen in the\r\nadministration is fully recognized by the native officials. As regards\r\nbrain power they equal Englishmen, and indeed are often superior to them,\r\nbut the classes from which the native officials are mainly drawn are, as a\r\nrule, deficient in that physical vigour which is required for executive\r\nwork, as one of the native officials, who himself was an exception to the\r\nrule, once told me, \"and therefore,\" he added, \"we must have an admixture\r\nof natives and Europeans in the service.\" I must, however, observe that,\r\nthough his remark is true as regards the Brahminical classes from which\r\nthe officials are mainly taken, I think it probable that, when education\r\nspreads, there will ultimately be found amongst the hardy peasantry of\r\nMysore a fair proportion of individuals who will have a sufficient degree\r\nof physical vigour for executive work. In confirmation of the remark I\r\nhave made as to the want of executive vigour on the part of native\r\nofficials, a defect which would be equally apparent in us were our energy\r\nnot kept up by fresh importations from home, I may mention that, under the\r\nnew regime, there has been a distinct falling off in the up-keep of\r\nroads, and in the detection of crime.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I may make a passing remark on a point\r\nwhich has not hitherto been noticed, so far as I am aware, by previous\r\nwriters. It has constantly been asserted by natives that we have not kept\r\nfaith with them as regards opening to them many appointments in the public\r\nservice which are at present reserved for Englishmen. I would call\r\nattention to the fact that one of the passages so often quoted contains\r\nreally no general promise of employment. This passage--taken from a clause\r\nin the East India Act, passed in Parliament, 1833--merely says \"That no\r\nnative of the said territories, nor any natural born subject of his\r\nmajesty resident therein, shall by reason _only_ of his religion, place of\r\nbirth, descent, colour, or any of them, be disabled from holding any\r\nplace, office, or employment under the said company.\" \"By reason _only_.\"\r\nYes, but this does not bar disqualification for other reasons, as for\r\ninstance the want of physical vigour to which I have alluded. Then mark\r\nthe careful limitation contained in the often quoted passage from the\r\nQueen's proclamation of 1858, which sets forth that \"It is our further\r\nwill, that, _as far as may be_, our subjects, of whatever race or creed,\r\nbe freely and impartially admitted to office in our service, the duties of\r\nwhich they may be qualified, by their education, _ability_ and integrity,\r\nduly to discharge.\" But natives have not, generally speaking, the ability\r\nto discharge executive duties requiring much physical vigour, and no one\r\nis more ready to admit that than the best among the natives. But besides\r\nexecutive efficiency there is the fact that the mere sight of the zeal,\r\nenergy, and general interest in progress exhibited by the English is to\r\nthe natives around them an education worth all the book instruction we\r\nhave imported into India. We cannot have too much of this leavening\r\nelement, and the effects of it are everywhere apparent. It is extremely\r\nstriking in the coffee districts, where many native planters have been,\r\nmuch improved as regards go, and a desire to adopt improvements, since\r\nEuropeans have settled more freely amongst them.\r\n\r\nBut it is time now to turn to the subject of the constitution of Mysore--a\r\nsubject which, I need hardly say, is of the greatest practical importance\r\nto those who hold, or may think of acquiring, property in the province.\r\n\r\nThe Instrument of Transfer, then, as it is officially called, by which\r\nMysore was made over to native administration on the 25th of March, 1881,\r\nbegins by declaring the installation of the Maharajah and his power to\r\nrule under certain general conditions, which are--(1) That the Maharajah\r\nand those who are to succeed him in the manner hereinafter provided, are\r\nto hold possession of and administer the province as long as they fulfil\r\nthe conditions laid down in the Instrument of Transfer; that (2) the\r\nsuccession should devolve on the Maharajah's lineal descendant, whether by\r\nblood or adoption, except in the case of disqualification through manifest\r\nunfitness to rule; and that (3) the Maharajah and his successors shall at\r\nall times remain faithful in allegiance and subordination to the British\r\nCrown, and perform all the duties which, in virtue of such allegiance and\r\nsubordination, may be demanded of them. Then follow clauses with reference\r\nto the subsidy to be paid to the British Government for protecting and\r\ndefending the province, military stipulations, foreign relations, coinage,\r\nrailways and telegraphs, and extradition, and as regards the last, it is\r\ndeclared that plenary jurisdiction over European British subjects in\r\nMysore shall continue to be invested in the Governor-General in Council,\r\nand that the Maharajah of Mysore shall only exercise such jurisdiction in\r\nrespect to European British subjects as may from time to time be delegated\r\nto him by the Viceroy. Then with reference to \"Laws and Settlements,\" it\r\nis declared that those in existence at the time of the transfer must be\r\nmaintained, and that the Maharajah of Mysore \"shall not repeal or modify\r\nsuch laws, or pass any laws or rules inconsistent therewith,\" and that no\r\nmaterial change in the system of administration as established previous to\r\nthe date of the transfer shall be made without the consent of the Viceroy.\r\nAnd finally, under this head, it is declared that all title-deeds granted,\r\nand all settlements of land revenues in force on March 25th, 1881 (the\r\ndate of the transfer), shall be maintained, excepting so far as they may\r\nbe rescinded or modified either by a competent court of law or with the\r\nconsent of the Governor-General in Council. Lastly, under the heading of\r\n\"British Relations,\" it is declared that \"the Maharajah of Mysore shall at\r\nall times conform to such advice as the Governor-General in Council may\r\noffer him with a view to the management of the finances, the settlement\r\nand collection of the revenues, the imposition of taxes, the\r\nadministration of justice, the extension of commerce, the encouragement of\r\ntrade, agriculture, and industry, and any other objects connected with His\r\nHighness's interests, the happiness of his subjects, and his relations to\r\nthe British Government.\" And, \"In the event of the breach or\r\nnon-observance of any of the foregoing conditions,\" the Governor-General\r\nmay resume possession of Mysore and administer it as he thinks fit. Such,\r\nthen, is a brief summary of the Constitution of Mysore; and it is most\r\nnecessary to dwell on it with some degree of minuteness in order to show\r\nthose Englishmen who are interested in Mysore, or who may be desirous of\r\nsettling there, that they and their possessions in that country are as\r\npractically under British rule as they would be in any part of British\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nI have previously pointed out that there is no income-tax in Mysore. I\r\nhave also alluded to the fact that, as the finances are in a flourishing\r\ncondition, and, beyond the subsidy annually levied, are free from any\r\nobligation to contribute to the general expenditure of British India,\r\nthere are ample and certain means available for developing the resources\r\nof the country. And that these means shall be devoted to that end\r\nexclusively, I would call particular attention to the fact that it has\r\nbeen laid down by the British Government that, after deducting the amount\r\nset apart annually for the personal expenses of the Maharajah, the\r\nremaining revenues of the province are to be spent on public purposes\r\nonly, under a regular system of an annual budget appropriation, and the\r\nproper accounting for such expenditure. So that, taking all the\r\ncircumstances into consideration, it is clear that the settlers in Mysore\r\nhave advantages over any other settlers in India. The taxes they pay on\r\ntheir lands are fixed and most moderate in amount, they have every\r\nsecurity that capital can enjoy, and they are living in a country which,\r\nafter an ample expenditure on public works of all kinds, has an ample\r\nannual surplus. But, besides those circumstances, the settlers in the\r\nprovince, and the inhabitants as well, have another advantage which must\r\nby no means be lost sight of, for Mysore has a Representative Assembly,\r\nwhich sits once a year, and which affords a ready means for publicly\r\nventilating any grievance, or making known any want which may be felt by\r\nthe community; and as there is no institution exactly like it in the\r\nworld, I propose to describe the constitution of the Assembly and its\r\nproceedings with some degree of minuteness.\r\n\r\nThe Mysore Representative Assembly, then, which was originated by Mr.\r\nRungacharlu, the first Prime Minister of Mysore, was inaugurated on the\r\n25th of August, 1881, or about five months after the accession of the\r\nMaharajah, by the following notification:\r\n\r\n\"His Highness the Maharajah is desirous that the views and objects which\r\nhis Government has in view in the measures adopted for the administration\r\nof the Province should be better known and appreciated by the people for\r\nwhose benefit they are intended, and he is of opinion that a beginning\r\ntowards the attainment of that object may he made by an annual meeting of\r\nthe representative landholders and merchants from all parts of the\r\nProvince, before whom the Dewan will place the results of the past year's\r\nadministration, and a programme of what is intended to be carried out in\r\nthe coming year. Such an arrangement, by bringing the people into\r\nimmediate connection with the Government, would serve to remove from their\r\nminds any misapprehension as regards the views and action of the\r\nGovernment, and would convince them that the interests of the Government\r\nare identical with those of the people.\r\n\r\n\"The annual meeting will be conveniently held at Mysore immediately after\r\nthe close of the Dassara festival, which occasion will offer an additional\r\ninducement to those invited to attend the meeting. For the present the\r\nLocal Fund Boards of the several districts will be asked to select from\r\namongst themselves and others of the district the persons who are to be\r\ndeputed to represent their respective districts at the meeting. In order\r\nto represent the landed interests of all the Talooks (counties), as well\r\nas the interests of trade, there should be sent one or two cultivating\r\nlandholders from each Talook, possessed of general influence and\r\ninformation amongst the people, and three or four leading merchants for\r\nthe district generally. A list of them should be sent beforehand to this\r\noffice, in order to arrange for their accommodation in Mysore. They may be\r\nallowed a small sum from the local funds to meet the actual expenses of\r\ntheir travelling.\"\r\n\r\nThe Assembly thus constituted was, as will have been perceived at a\r\nglance, a purely consultative body, and had no power whatever except (and\r\na highly important exception it is) that of publicly stating to the rulers\r\nof the country all the grievances and wants of the people. The only\r\ninstitution that I can hear of that at all resembles it is the Egyptian\r\nGeneral Assembly of the Legislative Council, but that, though a\r\nconsultative, and not at all a law-making body, has the power of putting a\r\nveto on any new tax proposed by the Government. In constitution, too, it\r\ndiffers widely from the Mysore Assembly, as the ministers have seats in\r\nit, while in Mysore no Government official can be a member of the\r\nAssembly. I may mention here that the Egyptian Assembly was initiated by\r\nLord Dufferin in May, 1883, and I would refer those interested in the\r\ncreation of representative institutions to his Report, No. 6 (1883), and\r\nto the Report on Egypt, No. 3 (1892), by Sir Evelyn Baring (now Lord\r\nCromer), both being Blue Books presented to the Houses of Parliament. It\r\nis interesting to note here that whereas Lord Dufferin took the first step\r\nin the direction of representative institutions by uniting, in the same\r\nassembly, Government officials, and members elected on the broad basis of\r\nmanhood suffrage, the native statesman began by carefully excluding the\r\nofficials, and allowing only the middle and upper classes to have anything\r\nto do with the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the Mysore Representative Assembly took place on\r\nOctober 7th, 1881, when 144 members attended. The Dewan first of all read\r\nthe annual report on the administration of the province, and after that\r\nthe members were called up in succession and asked to state their\r\ngrievances and wants. At the end of the session the Dewan's annual\r\nstatement, or report, and an account of the proceedings of the Assembly,\r\nare printed in English and in Kanarese.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, as we have seen, consisted of members partly appointed by\r\nthe Local Fund Boards, and partly of members nominated through the agency\r\nof Government officials, but at the conclusion of the Dewan's address of\r\nOctober 28th, 1890, an important change in the constitution of the\r\nAssembly was announced, and a new body of rules was issued. By these all\r\nmembers were in future to be elected, and the qualifications entitling a\r\nman to vote for, or be elected a member for a county (talook), were (1)\r\nthe payment of land revenues, a house and shop tax to the amount specified\r\nin the schedule[11] for each county; (2) the ownership of land to the\r\nvalue of 500 rupees a year, accompanied with residence in the county; and\r\n(3) any resident in a county who is a graduate of any Indian university is\r\ndeclared to be a duly qualified person. Those so qualified were to meet on\r\na certain day, of which a month's notice was to be given, and elect\r\nmembers from amongst themselves. 212 members from the counties were to be\r\nthus elected. The cities of Bangalore and Mysore return four members each,\r\nand these must either pay a house or shop tax of twenty-four rupees, or be\r\na graduate of any Indian university; the nine Local Fund Boards return two\r\nmembers each; the eighty-nine municipalities one for each municipality,\r\nand associations representing approved public interests, and of not less\r\nthan 100 members, and also associations of smaller numbers, but recognized\r\nby Government--as for instance the Planters' Associations--may depute one\r\nmember each, and the total of all the members is estimated at 351. By Rule\r\n6 it is declared that \"As the object of the Assembly is to elicit\r\nnon-official public opinion, no person holding a salaried appointment\r\nunder Government shall vote for, or be returned as, a member of the\r\nAssembly.\" By Rule 7, each member is to prepare and forward to the deputy\r\ncommissioner a memo describing seriatim the representations and\r\nsuggestions he may desire to make at the meeting of the Assembly; and by\r\nRule 9 the memoranda are to be forwarded, with the deputy-commissioner's\r\nremarks, to the Chief Secretary to Government. By Rule 10 all the members\r\nare to hold a formal meeting at Mysore not less than three days before the\r\nmeeting of the Assembly, and should they decide at this preliminary\r\nmeeting to bring forward at the Assembly any subjects not mentioned in the\r\nmemoranda previously sent in by members, a supplemental list of such\r\nsubjects must be sent in to the Chief Secretary.\r\n\r\nWhen announcing the adoption of these new rules, the Dewan alluded to the\r\nfact that the constitution now given did not insure a full popular\r\nrepresentation, and stated that numerous practical difficulties stood in\r\nthe way of widening the representation. Finally he concluded by observing\r\nthat, \"It is His Highness' sincere hope that the privilege he has now been\r\npleased to grant will be exercised to the fullest extent, and in the most\r\nbeneficial manner possible, and that it will be so appreciated by all as\r\nto enable His Highness gradually to enlarge the circle of electors, so as\r\nto give wider effect to the principle of representation in the\r\nconstitution of this Assembly.\"\r\n\r\nTo this, the first elected Assembly that ever sat in India, I was returned\r\nas representative of the South Mysore Planters' Association. On the 11th I\r\nproceeded to the city of Mysore, and on the 12th of October, 1891,\r\nattended the preliminary meeting of members, which was held in the\r\nRungacharlu Memorial Hall--a fine building with a large hall, which has a\r\nwide daïs at one end, and a, very wide gallery running along three sides\r\nof the hall. The meeting was held at 8 a.m. in the body of the hall,\r\nwhere I found that a considerable body of people, who I presume were\r\nmostly representatives, were present. The hall was arranged with benches,\r\nvery much as most modern churches are, and just below the daïs was a long\r\ntable with chairs on one side of it. It was proposed that I, the only\r\nEuropean present, should take the chair, and I accordingly did so, being\r\nsupported on either hand by two members who had a fluent command of\r\nEnglish, and what was of more importance to me, of Kanarese, for, though I\r\nhad a colloquial knowledge of that language, I had not such a command of\r\nit as was necessary for satisfactory public speaking. I accordingly read\r\nout in English (which a certain number of the audience knew) each, measure\r\nI proposed, and then informed the audience in Kanarese that one of the\r\nmembers would explain the subject in that language, and I found that this\r\narrangement answered all practical purposes. The following measures had\r\nbeen drawn up by me previously in Bangalore after consultation with some\r\nleading members of the Assembly, and were printed and circulated amongst\r\nthe members present, and it may not be uninteresting to give some of them\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe first point taken up related to measures for the prevention of famine,\r\nand, after some discussion, four proposals were unanimously agreed to, all\r\nof them for the promotion of the digging of wells either by private\r\nenterprise or through the agency of the State. The next point related to\r\nfuel and fodder reserves, which it was agreed should be established on the\r\nlands of all villages, or near all villages, wherever land suitable for\r\nthe purpose could be found. We then turned to a bill I had laid on the\r\ntable with reference to advances to labourers--an important and difficult\r\nsubject--when it was agreed that it should be referred to the Planters'\r\nAssociation for consideration. An amendment on the waste land rules for\r\nplanting trees for timber and fuel was then considered and agreed to.\r\nAfter this it was resolved that a Government agricultural chemist Ought to\r\nbe appointed, who would be competent to advise on agricultural practice,\r\ncattle disease, etc., and give lectures on such subjects. We then took up\r\nthe subject of British interference with proposed irrigation works in\r\nMysore, and resolved that the Mysoreans should be allowed to have the full\r\nuse of the water of Mysore for irrigation purposes, and be free from any\r\ninterference as long as the water, or what is left of it, is returned to\r\nits original channel. The subject of extradition was next considered, when\r\nthe representatives resolved that (1) complete reciprocity should be\r\ngranted between British and Mysore territory as regards warrants, and (2)\r\nthat British jurisdiction over railways in Mysore should be given up, or\r\nat least as regards all matters of theft. It was next decided that at the\r\nclose of the session the representatives should continue in office till\r\nnew members were elected. After this it was agreed that Government\r\nagricultural banks should be introduced. Then the representatives, having\r\nsat for about four hours, adjourned till the following day.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th we met again accordingly at 8 a.m., and on this occasion sat\r\nin the gallery, which was quite wide enough to accommodate the members. It\r\nwas proposed that I should take the chair, and I did so, and opened the\r\nproceedings by introducing rules to regulate the discussion. These were\r\nthat the introducer of a proposed measure should be allowed ten, and a\r\ndiscusser five minutes; that no one should interrupt or rise to speak\r\nbefore the previous speaker had sat down, and that a discusser could only\r\nbe heard once. These rules were agreed to, and I found the last two of\r\ngreat advantage in managing the proceedings. The first two, I was glad to\r\nfind, were hardly necessary, as anything in the shape of the British, or,\r\nworse still, the Irish wind-bag, did not appear to exist amongst the\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe next subject taken up was that of organization, and on the assumption\r\nthat the Government would grant our prayer that the present members should\r\nnot be dismissed at the end of the session, but should continue to be\r\nrepresentatives till their successors were elected, it was resolved that\r\nthere should be a standing central committee of the Assembly, and also\r\ndistrict and county committees, and it was agreed that the first should\r\nconsist of twenty-two members--for Bangalore and Mysore city six members\r\neach, one from each district, and one from each coffee planters'\r\nassociation. Seven members to constitute a quorum. The district committees\r\nwere to consist of one from each county, and two from the head-quarters of\r\nthe district, five being a quorum, and the county committees of three\r\nmembers. We then agreed to the members who were to form the central\r\ncommittee and district committees, and, after that, that the Maharajah\r\nshould be formally thanked for his action on his part as regards the\r\nAssembly, and that it should be prayed that the measures now asked for\r\nmight be granted. And finally, it was arranged that the standing central\r\ncommittee should draw up an address to the Maharajah, embodying the views\r\nand wishes of the representatives.\r\n\r\nThe meeting terminated at about 11 a.m., and immediately afterwards the\r\ncentral committee sat upstairs in a room at an angle of the building, when\r\nI was appointed chairman. We first took up the question of funds, and I\r\nsuggested that each member of the Assembly should subscribe one rupee.\r\nThis was agreed to, and I at once put a rupee on the table, and presently\r\nthere were about fifteen added, and a list was made out of those who had\r\npaid. We then agreed that an address should be presented to the Maharajah\r\nafter the termination of the meetings of the Assembly, and afterwards it\r\nwas arranged that Mr. C. Rangiengar, B.A., Advocate, Mysore, should be\r\nsecretary to the central committee, spend the funds at his discretion for\r\nprinting and advertising, and render an account once a year.\r\n\r\nThe next day was a _dies non_ as regards the Representative Assembly, but\r\nby no means so as regards the Rungacharlu Hall, which at eight in the\r\nmorning presented a most interesting appearance, being filled with a large\r\nassemblage of native ladies who had met together to witness the giving of\r\nthe prizes to the lady students of the Maharanee's College. The Maharajah\r\npresided on the occasion. Besides prizes for educational proficiency,\r\nthere were others for music and singing, and the winners of these played\r\nand sang on a platform below, on one side of the daïs. One of the\r\nmusicians, a tastefully-dressed young lady of thirteen, was a\r\ngranddaughter of Mr. Rungacharlu, the first Prime Minister of Mysore. One\r\nof the prize-takers was a widow--plainly dressed as widows should be--and\r\nas she came forward there was a loud clapping of hands from the women\r\nspectators in the gallery. I found, on inquiry, that the reason of this\r\ndemonstration was that she had lately given a lecture which had been much\r\nappreciated by the students. I have no space to give an account of the\r\nproceedings, though I hope to do so on some future occasion, and can only\r\nsay that a more interesting and picturesque assemblage it would be\r\ndifficult to imagine.\r\n\r\nOn the day following, October 15th, the Assembly was formally opened at\r\ntwelve, when the Dewan presided at a table on the raised platform. He was\r\nbacked and flanked by the principal European and native officers of State,\r\nwhile on his right sat Sir Harry Prendergast, V.C., the Resident at the\r\nCourt of Mysore. The English representatives, five in all, one of them\r\nrepresenting the gold mining interests of the province, had seats on the\r\nplatform, and so had as many representatives as there was room for. The\r\nremainder occupied the body of the hall. The Dewan then opened the tenth\r\nannual meeting of the Representative Assembly of Mysore, by reading the\r\nalready printed annual administration Report of the Province, and it may\r\nnot be uninteresting to quote the opening sentences of it:\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n    \"By command of His Highness the Maharajah, I have much pleasure\r\n    in welcoming you to this Assembly, which meets here to-day for\r\n    the first time under the election system sanctioned last year.\r\n    You come here as the duly elected representatives of the\r\n    agricultural, the industrial, and the commercial interests of the\r\n    State. Last year, when His Highness was pleased to grant the\r\n    valued privilege of election, he was not without some misgivings\r\n    as to how the experiment would succeed, but it is most gratifying\r\n    to His Highness that, though unused to the system, the electoral\r\n    body has been able, in the very first year of its existence, to\r\n    exercise the privilege with so much judgment and sense of\r\n    responsibility as to send to this Assembly men in every way\r\n    qualified to speak on their behalf. That men representing the\r\n    industry and the intellect of the country should have already\r\n    taken so much interest in the scheme augurs well for the future\r\n    of the institution. His Highness asks me to take this opportunity\r\n    publicly to acknowledge the expressions of warm gratitude which\r\n    have reached him from all sides for the privilege of election\r\n    granted last year.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dewan then proceeded to make his statement of the Revenue and\r\nExpenditure of 1890-91, by which it appeared that the Revenue for that\r\nperiod--the largest ever realized by the State--was 145 lakhs of rupees,\r\nor, at par,[12] £1,450,000, and the account showed a surplus of 23 lakhs,\r\nor £230,000; but from this had to be deducted a sum for expenditure on\r\nnew railways, which reduced the surplus, or rather, disposed of it to such\r\nan amount as to leave a balance of 12-1/2 lakhs, or £125,000. The budget\r\nwas then taken up in detail, and the Dewan showed in the most lucid manner\r\nthe financial position as regards the various heads of receipts and\r\nexpenditure, all of which I shall pass over except that relating to gold,\r\nwhich the reader will probably find interesting, for, as the Kanarese\r\nproverb says, \"If gold is to be seen, even a corpse will open its mouth.\"\r\nThere was, then, an increase in State receipts from gold mining dues to\r\nthe extent of 37,000 rupees in the amount of royalty, while \"Premia and\r\ndeposits on leases\" brought in 71,000 rupees. The mines in the Kolar gold\r\nfield during 1890 extracted 106,903 ounces of gold. Three of them--the\r\nMysore, Ooregum, and Nundydroog--showed a considerable increase in\r\nproduction over the previous year. The first increased from 49,238 oz. to\r\n58,183 oz.; the second from 16,437 oz. to 27,351 oz., and the third from\r\n6,129 oz. to 15,637 oz.\r\n\r\nThe Dewan then called the attention of the Assembly to the working of some\r\nof the principal departments of the State, beginning with the railways,\r\nand, after giving a very satisfactory account of the progress made,\r\nconcluded this branch of his subject by observing that \"As regards our\r\nmain railway policy there will be no pause in the course of development,\r\nand should our financial condition continue to improve, the next decade\r\nwill see the Province intersected with lines which, in the decade\r\npreceding the rendition, were only thought of as remote possibilities.\" He\r\nnext remarked on other public works, and showed that in the last ten years\r\nno less than 471 miles of entirely new roads had been opened up, while 218\r\nmiles of incomplete roads, which had been inherited at the time of the\r\nrendition, had been brought up to standard. Then he turned to irrigation,\r\nand stated that the large irrigation works commenced in former years were\r\nadvancing towards completion. And here the Dewan alluded to a matter of\r\nthe greatest importance, and to which I shall again return further on. It\r\nappears that the Supreme Government had actually put a stop to certain\r\nirrigation works begun by the Mysore Government on the ground that these\r\nwould lessen the supply of water from Mysore to British territory. As to\r\nthis the Dewan now observed on \"The difference which had arisen with the\r\nMadras authorities as to the rights of Mysore to the full use of its\r\ndrainage areas.\" The case had been laid before the Government of India,\r\nand the Dewan said that \"the basis for a solution of the difficulty has\r\nbeen arranged with the Madras Government in a way that is likely to remove\r\nto a considerable extent the check that the progress of our irrigation\r\nworks had received in tracts bordering upon the Madras Presidency.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of well irrigation too had not been neglected, and the Dewan\r\npointed out that its protective value in times of drought is far superior\r\nto tank irrigation, and observed that, \"During the last famine the only\r\noases in the midst of the general desolate appearance of the country were,\r\nbesides the tracts watered by our river channels, those special regions\r\nfavoured with well irrigation.\" So important was well irrigation, that the\r\nGovernment had resolved to make advances to ryots willing to construct\r\nthem, at a low rate of interest, and repayable by easy instalments in a\r\nlong series of years. In the event of water not being found, or found in\r\ninsufficient quantity, the Government had undertaken the risk of failure,\r\nso that the farmer was placed beyond all risk of loss. And, in order to\r\nfacilitate the progress of such works, a special officer had been\r\nappointed to give the advances on the spot, so as to avoid the delay\r\ncaused by the usual circuitous official correspondence.\r\n\r\nI may here pause for one moment to remark on the great value of the\r\nAssembly as regards any new measure like the one just alluded to, for it\r\noften happens that from the scarcity of newspapers, and the inability of\r\nthe poorer ryots to purchase them, measures of great value are not taken\r\nadvantage of, or only are so after a long delay. Now an assembly like that\r\nof Mysore provides an excellent means for distributing information on all\r\nGovernment matters, and in one part of his address the Dewan particularly\r\nrequested the representatives from two important districts to explain\r\nfully to the people certain matters, the particulars of which I cannot,\r\nfor want of space, give here.\r\n\r\nThe Dewan then went into the interesting subject of Forests, and it was\r\nsatisfactory to notice the progress that had been made in planting, and\r\nthat sandal wood had year after year been yielding an increased revenue.\r\nThe transition from forests to elephants was natural, and during the year\r\n70 had been caught. Some died after capture and others were liberated. Of\r\nthe 44 retained, 41, of which 14 were tuskers, were sold for 50,705\r\nrupees. Having fully discussed the elephants, the Dewan turned next to\r\neducation, and here he was able to record marked progress in every\r\ndirection, and especially in female instruction. There were now 97 girls'\r\nschools in the province, and an important change had been made as regards\r\ntheir immediate supervision, which was now exercised by local committees.\r\n\"The committees,\" said the Dewan, \"have been given large powers of\r\nmanagement, and the initiative rests, in almost all cases, with them,\r\nsubject to the approval of Government.\" The object of this of course was\r\nto interest the people in the subject, and the Dewan observed that \"Female\r\neducation cannot become firmly established in the country until the people\r\nbegin to look upon the education of their girls, whether children or\r\nadults, as necessary, and as obligatory as that of their boys. The\r\nGovernment have thought that the best way of securing this result in the\r\ninfancy of female education is to leave as much as possible to the\r\nintelligent and sympathetic guidance of local committees.\" After alluding\r\nto the results of the archæological survey, and dwelling on the fact that\r\nduring the past year 1,500 inscriptions were secured, some of which were\r\nof great value and interest, the Dewan then took up the subject of excise,\r\nand went into the reforms he proposed to institute as regards that\r\ndepartment. The census of Feb. 26th, 1891, was next alluded to, and by\r\nthis it appeared that, including the civil and military' station of\r\nBangalore, the population returned was 4,943,079 as compared with\r\n4,183,188 in 1881, and 5,055,412 in 1871. The increase during the last\r\ndecade was thus very considerable, but Mysore has still some progress to\r\nmake before it can bring up its numbers to the census return of 1871,\r\nnearly a million of persons having been swept away in the disastrous\r\nfamine of 1876-77. The municipal elections were next alluded to, and it\r\nwas announced that the cities of Bangalore and Mysore were to have an\r\nextension of the electoral system. The important subject of the reform of\r\nreligious and charitable institutions (there had been several\r\nrepresentations made as regards these in previous years by members of the\r\nAssembly) was next taken up, and it was announced that a specially\r\nqualified officer had been appointed to \"inquire into the subject on the\r\nspot, and to carry out the needed reform in the case of each institution\r\nunder the general and special orders of Government, and, when once all\r\ninstitutions are thoroughly reformed and placed upon a sound and efficient\r\nfooting, the future management of them on the lines laid down will, as\r\nheretofore, have to be carried on by the local executive authorities.\"\r\nAfter alluding to some contemplated reforms in the Civil Service of the\r\nprovince, the Dewan concluded his able address by alluding to the\r\napprehensions of famine which had been consequent on the failure of the\r\nrains, and congratulating the members on the fact that owing to good rain\r\nhaving fallen only a fortnight ago, the threatened danger had now passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the Dewan's address I then rose, and, as chairman\r\nof the preliminary meetings of representatives, alluded to the subject of\r\nthe organization of committees which we desired to carry into effect, and\r\nurged that, as far as possible, members should avoid going into petty\r\nlocal grievances, and devote their attention to those large general\r\nquestions which affect the whole province. After I had sat down a\r\ntranslation of the Dewan's address was then delivered in Kanarese, for the\r\nbenefit of the representatives who did not understand English, and the\r\nAssembly afterwards adjourned till the following morning.\r\n\r\nAfter the Assembly had adjourned the members of the central committee met\r\nin a private room, and we agreed on the terms of the address to the\r\nMaharajah. Then we returned to the Hall, as it had been thought advisable\r\nto take up several matters which had not been discussed at our first\r\npreliminary meeting, and it was again proposed that I should take the\r\nchair. The first proposal made was that members, instead of being annually\r\nelected to the Assembly, should be elected for three years, and this was\r\nunanimously carried. A leading native member next rose and proposed that\r\nno girl under ten years of age should be given in marriage. Then ensued a\r\nscene of excitement that baffles description. The representatives who, the\r\nmoment before, had been quite calm and collected, and who looked so\r\npassive that it seemed that nothing could have aroused them from a\r\ncondition of profound composure, became suddenly electrified. A burst of\r\ntongues arose simultaneously all over the Assembly. Several members got up\r\nand tried to speak at once, and one of these (I think I see him now), a\r\ntall, stout, elderly man with a voice of thunder, and his appearance much\r\naccentuated by an enormous bamboo pen which he had thrust behind his ear,\r\nentered into an altercation with the proposer of the motion. I had no\r\npresident's bell, and if I had had one I am sure I might have rung it in\r\nvain, and I thought it best to sit still for a little time, and let the\r\nrepresentatives liberate their minds. Presently, and the moment I saw the\r\nfirst signs of an abatement of the excitement, I rose, and, with a slight\r\nsignal of my hand quieted the audience, and observed that, as this was a\r\nsubject as to which there was evidently much difference of opinion, and as\r\nit was very desirable that, as regards the measures proposed at our\r\npreliminary meetings,[13] there should be a complete unanimity of opinion,\r\nI begged leave to suggest to the meeting that the subject might be\r\nadjourned, and, if desired, brought up at the next day's meeting of the\r\nfull Assembly. This was agreed to, and a member then proposed that two\r\nseers of grain (about equal to four lbs.) should be contributed yearly by\r\neach ryot, and stored up in a public granary against times of famine.\r\nThis, I confess, I thought, and still think, a sensible proposal, as, in\r\nthe first burst of a famine it is very desirable, till trade operations\r\nfrom a distance get under weigh, that local supplies should exist, but,\r\nafter some discussion, I found that the proposal met with such small\r\napproval, that I did not think of putting it to the meeting. It was next\r\nproposed, and as can easily be imagined, carried unanimously, that where,\r\nfrom the failure of the rains, there was absolutely no crop whatever, a\r\nremission of the assessment should be granted. Finally it was agreed that,\r\nat the opening of the Assembly on the following morning, I should bring up\r\nand speak on all the points that had been agreed to at the meetings over\r\nwhich I had presided, and the meeting broke up at three o'clock. After it\r\nwas over several of the representatives expressed to me their gratitude\r\nfor the interest I had shown in the affairs of Mysore, and from the\r\nnumerous evidences I subsequently had of the appreciation of the natives,\r\nI felt most amply repaid for the trouble I had taken.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, Friday, Oct. 16th, the Assembly met at eight\r\no'clock, and I was called on to proceed with my address as chairman of the\r\npreliminary meetings, and though I spoke as briefly as possible on each of\r\nthe points which had been agreed to, my speech lasted for one hour and\r\ntwenty minutes. After it was over the Dewan asked if any member desired to\r\nspeak on any of the points I had brought forward, but no one rose to do\r\nso, which was satisfactory evidence that complete unanimity had existed as\r\nregards the various points, and that I had correctly conveyed the opinions\r\nof the representatives. The Dewan then called upon each representative in\r\nturn to state any grievances, or make known any wants which his\r\nconstituents had desired him to represent, and a great many local wants as\r\nregards roads, hospitals, telegraphs, etc., were brought forward. The\r\nsubject that excited most interest, and afforded some amusement, was that\r\nof the age at which girls should be given in marriage, which had been\r\nbrought forward at the meeting of the day previous. Some discussion ensued\r\nregarding it, when it appeared that the point as to which the\r\nrepresentatives were really most concerned, was that of elderly men who\r\nhad no children marrying again and again with the hope of getting them,\r\nregarding which one of the representatives said to me in conversation, \"We\r\nobject to old fogies marrying young girls.\" The point was especially urged\r\nby one member, who argued in the most serious manner that, if a man when\r\nin the prime of life had no family there was little likelihood of success\r\nwhen he was between sixty and seventy years of age. This remark was\r\nreceived with general laughter, and shortly afterwards the Dewan made a\r\njudicious reply on the whole question, and said that, in his opinion, the\r\ninterference of the Government was inadvisable, and that the question was\r\none that ought to be settled by the people consulting privately on the\r\nsubject. Then the Assembly turned to other matters, and finally adjourned\r\nat midday.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that I subsequently had some conversation with natives\r\nregarding the marriage question, especially as to the age for\r\nconsummation, when I found that the pressure of public opinion, and the\r\nvarious discussions on the subject, which had appeared in the newspapers,\r\nhad already produced a considerable effect in delaying the time for\r\nmarried girls leaving the paternal roof to join their husbands.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be not uninteresting to mention too that, on the afternoon\r\nof the day on which I made my speech I fell in with two native gentlemen\r\nwho spoke to me about it. What I found had been particularly appreciated\r\n(and very naturally so as water is of such vital importance in India), was\r\nthe firm protest I had made against the Supreme Government restricting the\r\nMysoreans as to the use, for irrigation, of the waters of Mysore on the\r\nground that a more extended use of them would lessen the supply to the\r\nadjacent British territory. In the course of my speech, I made a very\r\ntelling point by supposing, for the sake of argument, that Mysore had, as\r\nhad been originally proposed, been annexed, and made an integral part of\r\nthe Madras Presidency. In that case, I asked, would the Government have\r\nlimited the supply of the water to the Mysore part of the presidency in\r\norder to improve the more distant irrigated tracts in other parts of\r\nBritish territory? I then argued that the British Government would\r\ncertainly not have done so, seeing that, to have so acted would have\r\ndiminished the means available for contending with famine, for, as I\r\nfully urged, it is perfectly well known that the further the water travels\r\nthe greater is the waste from percolation and evaporation, and the smaller\r\nthe amount of land it can irrigate. If, then, the British Government would\r\nnot have so acted had Mysore been annexed, what right, I asked, had it to\r\ninterfere with Mysore regarding the use of its waters, and thereby to\r\nincrease the risks of famine in that country? It was no wonder, I\r\ncontinued, that an English officer in the Mysore service had been heard to\r\nsay that he supposed Mysore would not be allowed to plant a tree, in case\r\nit might precipitate some moisture that might otherwise pass over into\r\nBritish territory.\r\n\r\nI may here mention another remark which the above mentioned native\r\ngentleman made as regards my speech. \"It was not so much the speech as the\r\nsense of fairness, and frankness, and sincerity which you showed that\r\nimpressed us.\" This remark showed, as I have often found, that the common\r\nidea of natives always having recourse to flattery is a mistaken one, and\r\nit was rather interesting to find the ideas of ancient times repeated by\r\none who could have heard hardly anything in the way of public speaking.\r\nThe reader may remember how Quinctilian in effect said that there is no\r\ninstrument of persuasion more powerful than an opinion of probity and\r\nhonour in the person who undertakes to persuade, and how it has been\r\npointed out that the powerful effect caused by the speaking of Pericles\r\nreally lay in the confidence which the people reposed in his integrity.\r\nBut it is time now to turn to the proceedings of the Assembly, which had\r\nbeen adjourned to Saturday, October 17th.\r\n\r\nOn that day, then, we met at 8 a.m., and it was proposed by one of the\r\nrepresentatives that the collection of the land revenues should in future\r\nbe postponed till after the harvest, as the present times of collection\r\nwere inconvenient to the cultivators and often compelled them to borrow\r\nmoney, or mortgage their crops in order to find money to meet the\r\nGovernment demands. The change asked for was warmly urged by the speaker,\r\nwho gave very convincing reasons, which I have no space to repeat here, in\r\nfavour of the proposed alteration. After this speech was over the Dewan\r\nturned to the head revenue officer and consulted him, and also two English\r\nofficials of great experience. I did not look at my watch, but I am sure\r\nthe consultation did not last five minutes. The Dewan then turned to the\r\nAssembly and said, \"This proposal is granted,\" and the decision was\r\nreceived with loud applause. The chief revenue and settlement officer\r\nafterwards told me that this was the most important point ever gained by\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\nI may pause here to remark that what I saw and heard at the Assembly,\r\ncombined with what I previously knew of the Mysore Government, satisfied\r\nme that a more perfect form of government does not exist in the world.\r\nHere, as we have just seen, was a most important measure gained for the\r\ncountry after what was really a very short consultative meeting between\r\nthe ruler and the ruled. The ruler--in other words the Dewan--was sitting\r\nlike a judge on the bench, patiently listening to and taking notes of the\r\nvarious wants of the people as the representatives came\r\nforward--occasionally consulting with his officials--granting some things,\r\nabsolutely refusing others, and announcing sometimes that the subject\r\nbrought forward would be taken into consideration, while the\r\nrepresentatives seemed to be perfectly satisfied that the ruler would\r\nwillingly do, and was willingly doing, the best he could for the common\r\ninterest. I may mention that I was particularly struck with the dignified,\r\ngentlemanly and friendly manner of the Dewan when consulting his English\r\nofficials, and there was evidently a mutual appreciation existing, which I\r\nhad afterwards distinct knowledge of when I subsequently heard some of\r\nthese officials alluding, in private conversation, to the Dewan. I have a\r\ngreat dislike to the idea of being thought guilty of flattery, but I\r\ncannot refrain from recording the remarkable fact that (and how rarely can\r\nthis be said of any public man), while I have heard much in favour of the\r\nDewan, I have never heard a single deprecatory remark made concerning his\r\nadministration of the province, either by natives or Europeans. Mysore is\r\nindeed extremely fortunate in having such a man as Mr. Sheshadri Iyer,\r\nsince made Sir K. Sheshadri Iyer, K.C.I.E., at the head of affairs. He has\r\nalready been granted an extension of the usual period of office (five\r\nyears), and it is to be hoped that the very doubtful practice of selecting\r\na new man for this important office, even though there may be a valuable\r\none at the helm, may be put aside for at least some years more.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly sat on the two following days, and was concluded by the\r\npresentation of an address to the Maharajah, thanking His Highness for\r\nhaving instituted an elected Assembly, and praying that the various wants\r\nbrought forward might meet with favourable consideration. In all, the\r\nAssembly, inclusive of the preliminary meetings of the representatives,\r\nsat for eight days, and though there was much earnestness in discussion,\r\nand much difference of opinion, not a single case of an exhibition of ill\r\nfeeling occurred, with the exception, as we have seen, of the occasion\r\nwhen the marriage question was brought forward, though that may be called\r\nan exhibition of warm and excited feeling rather than ill feeling.\r\n\r\nAs the reader will remember, the representatives have no power whatever,\r\nexcept, and a very important exception it of course is, of ventilating in\r\npublic, and in the presence of the Dewan and the leading officers of\r\nState, whatever grievances and wants they may desire to call attention to,\r\nand the machinery for this ventilation is now so complete that the\r\nrequirements even of those inhabiting the most inaccessible corners of\r\nthe province can be readily made known to the Government. And now this\r\nquestion naturally arises. When, if ever, is it probable that this\r\nAssembly will demand for itself some direct power of controlling, or\r\ndirecting the Government? As far as I could see at the time, or can see\r\nnow, the Assembly is never likely to ask for any power whatever, and I\r\nconfess that I was much struck with the fact that, though I had many\r\nprivate conversations relating to the Assembly, both with natives and\r\nEuropeans, I never expressed myself, nor did I ever hear anyone express, a\r\ndesire that the Assembly should have any power. But after a little\r\nreflection, the explanation of the absence of any such demand seems to be\r\nextremely obvious, for if we look into the history of all parliamentary\r\ninstitutions such as we have, we shall find that they have arisen\r\nprimarily from misgovernment, and I say primarily because such\r\ninstitutions in the United States and in our colonies are merely\r\ninheritances from the forefathers of the English founders of these\r\ncountries. The insuperable difficulty, then, in the way of those who\r\ndesire to create parliamentary institutions in India is, that there is no\r\nmisgovernment on which to start them, and that is why the Indian National\r\n(so called, for there is nothing really national about it) Congress have\r\nfound it advisable, as a preliminary step, to try and persuade the people,\r\nwith the aid of lying and seditious pamphlets, that they are misgoverned.\r\nIf indeed I were the absolute monarch of Mysore I could certainly, I feel\r\nsure, create Parliamentary Institutions, but only in one way that I can\r\nthink of. I should misgovern the country and worry and oppress the people,\r\nand at the same time keep the Assembly going, and after a time I should\r\nthus create a desire on the part of the representatives to have some means\r\nof keeping me in check. But at present there is no one to keep in check.\r\nThe Government is really too good for the creation of any desire for\r\nchange. For the ruler of Mysore is not only desirous of meeting the people\r\nhalf way, but even of anticipating their wants, and the people have a\r\nready means of making their wants known. And, when making known these\r\nwants, their representatives are not only free from the expense and\r\nannoyances to which Members of Parliament are exposed, but have a most\r\nenjoyable time of it as well, for the Assembly is held at the time of the\r\ngreat annual festival of the Dassara, when there are wonderfully\r\npicturesque processions, illuminations, and displays of fireworks. In\r\nfact, were it not for these attractions, I feel sure that it would be a\r\ndifficult matter to get the representatives together, because, though they\r\nare of course easily able to find many wants, there are no grievances so\r\nreal as to make the people generally take much, or indeed any, interest in\r\nthe proceedings of the Assembly, and in this connection I may mention the\r\nfollowing confirmatory facts.\r\n\r\nOn the morning following the breaking up of the Assembly I left Mysore to\r\nmake a tour in Coorg to visit the plantations in that district, and drove\r\nfirst of all sixteen miles to breakfast at a Travellers' Bungalow on the\r\nmain road. While breakfast was being prepared I went for a stroll, and\r\nfell into conversation with the first native I met, who, I found, was,\r\nwith the aid of a number of labourers, working a plantation of palms and\r\nfruit-trees at a short distance from the bungalow. I expressed a wish to\r\nsee the plantation, and, when on our way there, told him that I had just\r\nbeen attending the Representative Assembly at Mysore. Just imagine my\r\nfeelings, when he told me that he had never heard of it, nor indeed when\r\nhe did hear of it did he ask me a single question about it. And yet we\r\nwere only sixteen miles from the capital, and on one of the main roads of\r\nthe province. He was, too, a man of fair intelligence and, though we\r\nconversed in Kanarese, he told me that he knew some English, which proved\r\nthat he was a man of a certain degree of education. On my return to my\r\nestates I found that, though the natives had heard of the Assembly\r\n(probably because the native representative lived within a few miles of my\r\nhouse), no one seemed to take any interest in its proceedings, and I do\r\nnot remember having been asked a single question with reference to it. The\r\nexplanation, of course, of this state of things is that the people are\r\nperfectly contented, and satisfied with the steady progress they see going\r\non around them. There is therefore no demand[14] for representative\r\ninstitutions, or the acquisition of power by the people, for while they\r\nsee abundant signs of progress, there is no oppression, and therefore\r\nthere are no real grievances. But, though there is no such demand, I must\r\ncaution the reader against supposing that I do not attach much importance\r\nto the Assembly as a highly valuable means of bringing the people and\r\ntheir rulers into friendly touch with each other, and as a most useful\r\nmeans of inter-communication regarding every fact that it is important for\r\nthe ruler and the ruled to know. Such an assembly is indeed of the highest\r\nvalue, and I have no doubt that a similar kind of assembly would be\r\nvaluable in many parts of India. And such assemblies will in the future be\r\nfar more necessary and valuable than such institutions would have been in\r\nthe past, because, in former times, the rulers, not being nearly so much\r\nburdened with office and desk-work as they now are, had far more leisure\r\ntime to mix with the people, and hear from them the expression of their\r\nwants or grievances.\r\n\r\nI have alluded previously to the lying and seditious pamphlets which have\r\nbeen circulated by the so-called Indian National Congress (and I say\r\nso-called because, as we shall see, there is really nothing national about\r\nit), and allude to them again partly in order to point out that they are a\r\nmost cheering evidence of the universal good government in India, because,\r\nhad it been really ill governed, there would have been no occasion to\r\nissue the pamphlets in question. The fact is, that the agitators of the\r\nCongress found it necessary to create a case as a ground-work for\r\ndemanding representative institutions for India, and began by imitating\r\nthe action of the Irish agitators. And here, for the benefit of those who\r\nhave not had time to study Indian affairs, it may be as well to give a\r\nbrief description of the Indian Congress, more especially as those who\r\nknow but very little of India may confound it with the kind of assembly we\r\nhave in Mysore, and which I have suggested for adoption in other parts of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nWhen I was passing through Poona in the year 1879, I was called upon by\r\nseven leading members of the native community who knew of the interest I\r\nhad taken in Indian affairs, and in the course of our conversation they\r\nmade some remarks on the desire of the educated natives for some share of\r\npolitical power. I then explained to them that, as it was clear that India\r\nwas entirely unfit for representative institutions, the only result would\r\nbe that power would be transferred from a limited class of Englishmen to a\r\nvery limited class of natives, which would be of no advantage to the\r\ncountry whatever. My remarks were followed by a dead silence which was\r\nbroken by one of them saying, in a desponding tone, \"you have educated us,\r\nand you have made us discontented accordingly,\" thus illustrating very\r\nforcibly what I suppose Solomon meant when he said, \"He that increaseth\r\nknowledge increaseth sorrow.\" But, however that may be, the utterance of\r\nthe native in question explains the origin of the Indian Congress which\r\nwas started in 1885 by a small number of the educated classes who began to\r\nclimb the political tree with considerable vigour, illustrating as they\r\ndid so the native proverb which tells us that \"The higher the monkey\r\nclimbs the more he shows his tail.\" And, in fact, the members of the\r\nCongress showed theirs so completely when they climbed to the top of their\r\npolitical tree at Madras in 1887, that their proceedings would be hardly\r\nworth noticing were it not that they might be the means of prejudicing the\r\nproper claims of the natives to consultative assemblies like the one we\r\nhave in Mysore. With people less advanced as regards common sense than the\r\nnatives of India, and also less suspicious of the educated classes, the\r\nCongress wallahs, as they are sometimes called, might have done some\r\nmischief, but the only harm they have really done, and I consider it no\r\nsmall harm, is to lower the educated natives in general in the ideas of\r\nthose who have not had an opportunity of knowing the best of them, and so\r\nappreciating their admirable abilities and calm common sense. For when the\r\npublic knows, as all those who have paid any attention to the subject do\r\nknow, that the members of the Congress are now selling pamphlets which are\r\nintended to bring the Queen's Government into hatred and contempt, its\r\nopinion of the educated natives of India is not likely to be a high one.\r\nAnd in order to make quite sure that the Congress is still selling the\r\npamphlets in question, I suggested to the secretary of the Athenæum in\r\nJune, 1892, to purchase for the library of that club (and he accordingly\r\ndid so), from the Indian Congress office in London, a copy of the Congress\r\nproceedings with which the pamphlets in question are bound up. And it may\r\nnot be uninteresting to note here that Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, M.P., as a\r\nleading member of the Congress, is therefore one of the sellers of the\r\npamphlets. It is, however, only fair to add, as an excuse for Mr.\r\nDadabhai Naoroji and his misguided associates, that they have, after all,\r\nonly followed on the track of the Irish agitators, and no doubt consider\r\nthat the preaching of sedition against the Government to whom they owe so\r\nmuch is the proper course to pursue when aiming at political power. And as\r\nan extenuation of their action it should also be considered that the\r\nmembers of the Congress, who at first were acting in a perfectly\r\nlegitimate manner, eventually fell under the guidance of a retired member\r\nof the Indian Civil Service--a certain Mr. Hume--who seems to have lodged\r\nsome of his own extravagant ideas in the heads of the raw and\r\ninexperienced members of the Congress, and who is supposed to be the\r\nauthor of the seditious pamphlets. And now let me give a brief account of\r\nthe Congress, and its aims and views.\r\n\r\nThe first Congress, which met in Bombay in December, 1885, consisted of\r\nseventy-eight persons, who came from twenty-five places. They were neither\r\nelected nor delegated, and how they came together does not appear in the\r\npublished proceedings of the Congress. The principal resolution passed on\r\nthe occasion related to the reforms of the various Indian Councils.\r\n\r\nThe second Congress, which was composed of 440 persons, who were partly\r\nelected and partly delegated, and of persons who could produce no evidence\r\nof being one or the other, met in Calcutta in December, 1886, and (p. 10\r\nof Report of 1887) \"passed a series of resolutions of the highest\r\nimportance,\" which is undoubtedly true, as the result of them would, if\r\ncarried into effect, practically be to substitute the rule of the Congress\r\nfor that of the Queen. This change was proposed to be effected by\r\nreconstituting the Provincial, Legislative, and Governor-General's\r\nCouncil, enlarging them, and giving \"not less than one half\" (p. 217 of\r\nReport of 1887) of the seats to members elected through the agency of the\r\nCongress. This proposed measure was justly considered by the delegates to\r\nbe the key of the position, as we shall more fully see when we come to the\r\nconsideration of the proceedings of the next Congress.\r\n\r\nThis, the third Congress, met at Madras in December, 1887, when 604\r\ndelegates (a large number of whom were lawyers and newspaper editors), who\r\n\"were appointed either at open public meetings or by a political or trade\r\nassociation,\" assembled and passed no less than eleven resolutions. The\r\nsecond, fifth and eighth of these are worthy of notice, as also are the\r\nseditious political pamphlets previously alluded to, which, for convenient\r\nreference, are bound up with the report of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe second resolution (p. 82 of Report of 1887) reaffirms the resolutions\r\nof the two previous Congresses, which demand the expansion and reforms of\r\nthe various Indian Councils. Here the first speaker (p. 83) was a Mr.\r\nBannerjee, a newspaper editor, who in his introductory remarks in support\r\nof the resolution assured the delegates that \"the dream of ages is about\r\nto be realized.\" We are not the legislators of the country, he further on\r\nremarks, \"though we hope to be so some day when the Councils are\r\nreconstituted,\" and eloquent was the language of the speaker when he\r\nsubsequently dwelt on the fact that the power of making the laws would at\r\nonce give them every reform they could desire. Mr. Bannerjee was succeeded\r\nby other native speakers, who dwelt warmly upon the advantages of\r\nrepresentative institutions, and these were followed by Mr. Norton,\r\nCoroner of Madras, who most highly extolled the resolution. \"That,\" he\r\nsaid, \"is the key of all your future triumph\" (p. 90), and further on in\r\nhis speech he urges them to persevere up to the day \"when you shall place\r\nyour hand upon the purse strings of the country and the government,\" for,\r\nhe continued, \"once you control the finances, you will taste the true\r\nmeaning of power and freedom.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here, after all the talk about the value of representative\r\ninstitutions, and just as the Congress seemed to be on the verge of\r\nrecommending parliamentary institutions such as we have, the members\r\nsuddenly wheeled about and practically declared that India was unfit for\r\nthem by deciding (p. 91) that, as the rural districts might not elect\r\nsuitable members, the so-called representatives of the people were to be\r\nnominated by an electoral college, which was to be composed of members\r\nsent up from the various district and municipal boards, chambers of\r\ncommerce, and universities. The power of election was thus to be\r\nconferred, to use Mr. Norton's words, on \"a body of men who would\r\npractically represent the flower of the educated inhabitants.\" These views\r\nwere much applauded by the delegates, who thus ratified the system of\r\nnominating the so-called representatives, and which system, I may add, is\r\ncarefully laid down in Clause 2 of Resolution IV. of 1886 (p. 217). Having\r\nthus most practically declared that India is quite unfit for\r\nrepresentative institutions in the ordinary sense of the word, Mr. Norton\r\nproceeded to point out that, as the desired power for reconstituting the\r\ngovernment is not likely to be obtained in India, they must work on the\r\npeople of England, who at present believe, he says (p. 92), that the\r\nIndian Government is \"being beneficiently carried on.\" \"You must disturb\r\nthat belief,\" he continued. In other words, he might have said, you must\r\ndo what the Parnellites did, or attempted to do, in England. And\r\naccordingly the Congress wirepullers have set up an agency in London, and\r\nhave posted placards purporting to be an appeal from 200 millions of India\r\nto the people of England.\r\n\r\nBut after all, the desired majority in the Indian Councils, which the\r\ndelegates rightly declared to be the key of the whole position, would be\r\ninsufficiently supported without an army and an armed population at the\r\nback of it, and all in sympathy with the native soldiers in the English\r\nservice. These wants, however, are carefully attended to in Resolutions 5\r\nand 8, which we will now briefly glance at.\r\n\r\nRead by itself, the Fifth Resolution seems to be harmless, and even\r\nlaudable, for it expresses a desire (p. 123) for \"A system of volunteering\r\nfor the Indian inhabitants of the country such as may qualify them to\r\nsupport the Government in a crisis.\" But the writer of the introductory\r\narticle to the Report (p. 48) shows the great value the force would be in\r\nbringing pressure to bear on the Government, and points out that, with\r\n250,000 native volunteers, with many times that number trained in previous\r\nyears, and backed by the whole country, and with all the native troops (p.\r\n49) more in sympathy with their fellow-countrymen than with the English,\r\nthe present system of government would be impossible. And it is further\r\npointed out in the introductory article that \"This means a revolution--a\r\nnoiseless bloodless revolution--but none the less a complete revolution.\"\r\nThen the writer reckons that these volunteers \"will be backed by the whole\r\ncountry,\" and this naturally leads to the consideration of the Eighth\r\nResolution, for the backing would obviously be of much greater value were\r\nthe whole population armed.\r\n\r\nThis Resolution (p. 147) demands the repeal of the Arms Act on account of\r\nthe \"hardship it causes, and the unmerited slur which it casts on the\r\npeople of this country.\" Now as any respectable person can obtain a\r\nlicense to carry firearms for under 4s., and as cultivators are granted\r\nlicenses gratis in order that they may, free of all charge, defend\r\nthemselves and their crops from wild animals, and as we know further from\r\nthe great number of licenses granted that there can be no difficulty in\r\nobtaining them, it is evident that there can be no hardship in connection\r\nwith this Act--a conclusion which is further confirmed by the fact that,\r\nin consequence of the number of guns in the hands of natives, wild animals\r\nare becoming rarer, and, as I can personally testify, have in many cases\r\nbeen almost completely exterminated. And if we consider further that the\r\nnecessity for taking out a license in India can inflict no greater slur\r\nthan is cast on the English in England by their having to take out gun\r\nlicenses, it is evident that the vehemently expressed desire for the\r\nrepeal of this Act is only explicable when read along with the previously\r\nquoted remarks with reference to the native volunteering and the armed\r\npopulation in sympathy with them at their back, and with the detonating\r\nmatter which appears in those seditious pamphlets to which I shall now\r\nbriefly refer.\r\n\r\nThese pamphlets, or rather translations of them, are printed at the close\r\nof the Report of 1887, and complete our view of the situation, which may\r\nbe shortly described by saying that, while the delegates in the van\r\ndeliver speeches for English consumption full of expressions of loyalty\r\nand praises of our rule, the wirepullers in the rear are distributing\r\npamphlets amongst the people in which all expressions of loyalty are\r\nabsent, while all the evils the people suffer from are attributed to our\r\nGovernment, and the Queen's English officials are held up to execration as\r\ntypes of everything that is at once brutal and tyrannical. The second\r\npamphlet gives us a dialogue between a native barrister, and a farmer\r\ncalled Rambaksh, and between them as much evil is said of us and our rule\r\nas can well be packed into so short a space. As an instance of the way in\r\nwhich the English officials ill-treat the natives, Rambaksh declares that\r\nbecause on one occasion he had not furnished enough grass for the horses\r\nof the collector--Mr. Zabardust (literally a brutal and overbearing\r\ntyrant), he had been struck by the Sahib over the face and mouth, and that\r\nby his orders he (Rambaksh) had been \"dragged away and flogged till he\r\nbecame insensible. It was months before he could walk\" (p. 209 of Report).\r\nThen the India of the present is contrasted with what India would be if it\r\nwere under the rule of the Congress, and an allegorical comparison is made\r\nbetween the village of Kambaktpur (the abode of misery) and that of\r\nShamshpur (the abode of joy). The moral is that British rule, which is\r\ntypified by the former, is making the people poorer and poorer, that\r\nthrough it land is going out of cultivation, that oxen for the plough are\r\nbecoming scarce, that the villages are going to ruin, and that nothing\r\nnourishes except the liquor shops in which the Government encourages\r\ndrinking, while the very irrigation works we are providing as a protection\r\nagainst famine are described as an evil, and a mere pretext for extorting\r\nmore money from the people. The village of Shamshpur (the abode of joy),\r\non the other hand, is described in glowing colours, and we need hardly say\r\nis the home of the institutions to be introduced by the Congress. The only\r\nconclusion to be drawn from all this by the masses of India is, that the\r\nsooner they rebel against the existing rule, and substitute for it the\r\nrule of the Congress, the sooner will they leave the abode of misery, and\r\nenter the abode of joy, where all the delights to be provided by the\r\nCongress will be theirs. The imaginary dialogue concludes (p. 214) with a\r\ndemand for money to carry on the work, and the barrister suggests to the\r\nfarmer various injurious means for the collection, which Rambaksh promises\r\nto carry out. He then tenders payment of some fees previously owing to the\r\nbarrister, who indeed receives the money, but magnanimously declares his\r\nintention of enrolling Rambaksh as a member of the association, and paying\r\nin the fees as a contribution from Rambaksh. \"Blessed are the earnings of\r\nthe virtuous which go to the service of God,\" said the barrister, and with\r\nthis pious utterance the dialogue closes.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of these pamphlets in dialogue form, it appears, from the\r\nstatement in the introductory article of the Report, that the emissaries\r\nof this Indian League have been gathering in money from the poorest\r\nclasses in India, down even to coolies. No less than 5,500 rupees, it\r\nappears (p. 11), were collected from 8,000 persons, in sums varying from 1\r\nanna to 1 rupee 8 annas, and some 8,000 rupees were contributed in sums of\r\nfrom 1 rupee 8 annas to 30 rupees. But it is unnecessary to pursue further\r\nthe work of the Congress, and it is sufficient to say that its proceedings\r\nwere lately brought before the House of Commons, and that the action of\r\nMr. Hume, in writing and publishing a kind of proclamation of a most\r\nobjectionable character in connection with the Congress, was denounced in\r\nthe House of Commons in strong terms. It is time, however, to close these\r\nbrief remarks on the Indian Congress. It still exists, but in a\r\nlanguishing form, and will probably gradually disappear. It has sought to\r\nbring the Queen's Government into hatred and contempt. The only effect it\r\nhas had is to bring the educated classes of India into ridicule and\r\ncontempt in the minds of those who are imperfectly acquainted with them,\r\nand perhaps to delay the extension of those Representative Assemblies\r\nwhich are so well suited to the requirements of the inhabitants of India,\r\nand the value of which I trust I have sufficiently shown.\r\n\r\nSince this chapter was written I have met with a passage in one of the\r\nspeeches of a member of the Congress which is highly creditable to the\r\ncandour of the Congressionists, and which proves that we are quite right\r\nin keeping in our own hands all, or nearly all, important executive and\r\ngoverning power. The passage occurs in the Fourth Report of the Indian\r\nNational Congress (p. 49), and one of the members said on this occasion:\r\n\r\n\"But it is a fact, which no one present will call in question, that what\r\npreponderates in the national character is quiescence or passivity, the\r\nactive virtues being thrown into the background, or remaining in a state\r\nof dormancy.\" And further on the speaker says, \"The virtues we are sadly\r\ndeficient in are courage, enterprise, the will to do and the heart to do.\"\r\n(Cheers.)\r\n\r\nThese remarks, which were received with assenting cheers, should be read\r\nin connection with those made on the Queen's Proclamation in the earlier\r\npages of this chapter.\r\n\r\nI may observe finally that if the above-mentioned qualities are, as the\r\nnative speaker complains, deficient, it is simply because the climate of\r\nIndia is not favourable to their production. As an Indian gentleman once\r\nsaid to me in London, \"Here I am glad to go out for a walk. In Madras I\r\nfind it an exertion to walk across a room.\" That explains our presence in\r\nIndia, and the necessity for keeping all important active work in our own\r\nhands. The natives are not at all to blame for being deficient in the\r\nactive virtues. We ourselves, our bull-dogs, and our vegetables would\r\nalike decline without constant renewal by fresh importations from England.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] The landed qualification varies from 100 rupees to 300 rupees, and\r\nthe house and shop qualification from 13 rupees to 18 rupees. This\r\narrangement has evidently been made to suit the wealth or poverty of\r\nparticular parts of the country. This seems to be rather an inconvenient\r\nsystem, and it is difficult to see why the lower rates of qualification\r\nshould not be made universal.\r\n\r\n[12] For all practical spending purposes in India the rupee may be\r\nreckoned at par. It is only when it requires to be turned into gold for\r\nthe purchase of articles in England that its gold value must be taken into\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n[13] The meeting now held was, I am aware, quite out of order, but as the\r\nAssembly had taken a new departure some laxness was permissible at first.\r\n\r\n[14] On looking at the Government Report of the proceedings of the\r\nAssembly for 1891 (which I may observe was not published till the year\r\nfollowing), I find that, though 340 members were elected, only 262\r\nattended. No less than seventy-eight members failed to put in an\r\nappearance, and the only probable explanation of this that I can give is\r\nthat these members felt that they had nothing in particular to represent\r\nto the Government, and therefore thought that they might much better\r\nremain at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY AND SPORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the numerous books that have been written on Sport in India, a\r\nchapter on this subject might at first sight seem superfluous. So might,\r\nat first sight, another novel full of what has been written thousands of\r\ntimes before about love. And yet we never tire of hearing or reading of\r\neither, and naturally, for both appeal to the imagination, and carry the\r\nmind far away from business or carking cares, or, in other words, that\r\nproverbial smoky chimney with which every house is provided. And if the\r\nmere reading of love or sport makes men and women feel better because it\r\ntakes them away from themselves (we should have no mirrors in our rooms),\r\nwhat must the reality of either be? For both dart through the system with\r\nelectric and delight-yielding force, and produce effects which, to those\r\nwho have not experienced them, are wellnigh incredible. And, as regards\r\nbig game shooting in particular, the effects are so astonishing that one\r\nalmost ceases to believe in them till another experience proves over again\r\nthat sport, or even the prospect of sport, can effect miracles, or at\r\nleast that it can cause an alteration in the system through the action of\r\nthe mind. And, some eighteen months ago, I realized this most vividly when\r\nfeeling much out of sorts, and indeed unfit for anything. For just at the\r\ntime of my deepest depression, news came in that a tiger had killed two\r\ncattle in my plantation, and, what made the news much more acceptable,\r\ntwo trespassing cattle--animals which are the plague of a planter's life.\r\nThe news acted like a charm. I at once felt slightly better, better still\r\nwhen I arrived at the spot and saw the traces of the cattle having been\r\ndragged along the ground, and the bodies of the slain--one more than half\r\neaten and the other untouched--and almost well when I returned to the\r\nbungalow to make preparations for hunting up the tiger. There is no tonic\r\nhalf so good as news of a tiger, and I feel that even news of a bear would\r\nrival in a great many cases all that a doctor could do for me. But, though\r\ntiger shooting is a valuable and delightful sport, it is equalled if not\r\neclipsed by stalking on the mountains amidst the beautiful and splendid\r\nscenery of the Western Ghauts, when you traverse the forest-margined open\r\nlands rifle in hand, feeling that everything depends upon yourself, and\r\nfollowed by a tried and experienced shikari on whose keen sight and\r\ncoolness you can thoroughly rely. There are natives of course and natives,\r\njust as there are Europeans and Europeans, but there are natives who have\r\nbeen gifted with the greatest daring, coolness, and the promptest presence\r\nof mind, and who are capable of much personal devotion to those who know\r\nhow to treat them. I was fortunate enough to have one of these in my\r\nservice, and to no sporting scenes in life can I look back with greater\r\npleasure than when I was able, with my trusted native follower, to spend\r\ndelightful mornings and evenings, and at certain times whole days, in\r\nstalking bears, bison, and sambur in the Western Mysore mountains. Danger,\r\ntoo, there was at times, and quite sufficient to give a pleasing amount of\r\nadventurous feeling to the sport. Indeed, without this moderate degree of\r\ndanger the sport would have been of quite a different kind, for is it not\r\nevident that all sport is to be divided into two widely different\r\nclasses--sport in which you are liable to be attacked, and sport where\r\nthe attack is all on one side? It is, in short, the danger, or the\r\npossibility of danger, which is the vital elixir of big game shooting, and\r\nwhich gives one, too, an opportunity of knowing oneself, and gauging one's\r\npresence of mind, or the want of it, as the case may be. But what, after\r\nall, is the amount of danger? That depends very much on the experience of\r\nthe sportsman. You may make big game shooting as dangerous as you please,\r\nand by following up a wounded bear or bison in a careless manner meet with\r\nan accident, but if proper precautions are taken, the danger of following\r\nup these animals is by no means so great as is generally supposed. But,\r\nthough that is so as regards bears and bisons, I must caution the reader\r\nagainst supposing that there is not considerable risk in following up\r\nwounded tigers on foot, and there can be no doubt that, as Sir Samuel\r\nBaker says, following a wounded tiger into the jungle on foot is a work of\r\nextreme danger. But even this may be largely diminished if proper\r\nprecautions are taken, though it must be admitted that, from the great\r\ndifficulty of distinguishing a tiger lying amongst dried forest leaves,\r\nthere must be a considerable amount of risk, though the amount of it is\r\nrather difficult to determine, but I may mention that though I suppose\r\nupwards of forty tigers have been killed in the neighbourhood of my\r\nplantation, only two natives have been killed when out shooting. Besides\r\nthese accidents, one man recovered from thirteen lacerated wounds, and\r\nanother was deprived of his ear and cheek by the blow of a wounded tiger's\r\npaw. As regards the comparative risks to life of tigers, bears, and\r\npanthers, I have only been able to meet with one return which throws any\r\nlight on the subject--a return which confirms the native view as to the\r\nbear being more dangerous than the tiger, and the panther much less\r\ndangerous than either. The return in question is to be found in the \"North\r\nKanara Gazetteer,\" and was supplied by the late Colonel W. Peyton, who\r\nwrote the section on Wild Animals. From this it appears that in North\r\nKanara, during the twenty-two years ending 1877, 510 tigers were killed\r\nand 44 persons killed by them, one of whom was Lieutenant Power, of the\r\n35th Madras Infantry. Between the years 1856 and 1882 51 bears were killed\r\nand 22 persons killed by them, one of whom was Lord Edward Percy St. Maur,\r\nsecond son of the Duke of Somerset. Between the years 1856 and 1877 805\r\npanthers were killed and 22 persons killed by them. From these returns it\r\nwould appear that the bear is about four times as dangerous as the tiger,\r\nthat the tiger is about three times as dangerous as the panther, and that\r\nthe bear is about fourteen times as dangerous to man as the panther. As\r\nregards comparative destructiveness to animal life, I may observe in\r\npassing that the tiger seems to be more troublesome than the panther, and\r\nthat Colonel Peyton records between 1878 and 1882 4,041 deaths of cattle\r\nkilled by tigers against 1,617 killed by panthers. The bison (_gavoeus\r\ngaurus_) would appear to be very seldom dangerous to man, if I may judge\r\nby the fact that in his long experience Colonel Peyton does not record a\r\nsingle death from the gaur, though he observes that it frequently charges\r\nwhen attacked. In my part of Mysore I have heard of but one death, which\r\noccurred in the case of a native who was tracking a bull which had been\r\nwounded by one of my managers. The wild boars, I may here add, seem to be\r\nnow, from being much hunted, no doubt, more dangerous than they were in\r\nformer years. Within the last two years in my district five persons were\r\nseverely wounded by them, of whom three died. But it is natural that all\r\nwild animals should become more dangerous the more they are hunted, and,\r\nrather to my amusement, my old shikari, to whom I have previously alluded,\r\ncomplained in a querulous and aggrieved tone that every animal--even the\r\nsambur deer--seemed to charge one nowadays. And this is a fact worth\r\nrecording, and if wild animals are declining in numbers, it is some\r\ncomfort to think that the sport to be had from the remainder will improve.\r\nBut it is time to close these rather desultory remarks, and treat the\r\nsubject in a systematic manner, and I now proceed to say (1) something as\r\nregards the natural history of Mysore, and (2) something as to the big\r\ngame shooting of the Province. I may here mention that all the anecdotes\r\ngiven will either be interesting from a natural history point of view, or\r\ntold with the view of illustrating points likely to be of use to the\r\ninexperienced sportsman.\r\n\r\nAs the author of the Gazetteer of the Province, in his opening sentence on\r\nthe fauna of Mysore, says with much truth, that \"Nothing less than a\r\nseparate treatise, and that a voluminous one, could do justice to the\r\nmarvellous wealth of the animal kingdom in a province under the tropics\r\nmarked by so many varied natural features as Mysore,\" I need hardly say\r\nthat I have only space to make a cursory allusion to the subject. The\r\nvarieties of animals, reptiles, birds, fish, and insects are indeed very\r\nnumerous, and though Mr. Rice informs us that he has only made an attempt\r\nto collect the names of the main representatives, he enumerates no less\r\nthan 70 mammals, 332 birds, 35 reptiles, 42 fishes, and 49 insects, though\r\nonly the leading families of the last are given, and many kinds of fish\r\nhave not been identified. But, though I cannot, as I have said, go at any\r\nlength into the subject, I can at least, give the names of the animals and\r\nbirds which are of more or less interest to sportsmen, and perhaps touch\r\nupon some which are mainly of interest to the naturalist. There are then\r\nto be found in Mysore, elephants, tigers, panthers, hunting leopards,\r\nbears, wolves, jungle-dogs, hyenas, and foxes. Amongst the graminivorous\r\nanimals I may mention the _gavoeus gaurus_, commonly called bison (a\r\nname to which I shall adhere as it is the one in common use), the sambur\r\ndeer, the spotted deer, the hog deer, and the barking deer or jungle\r\nsheep. There are four kinds of antelopes, the nilgei, four-horned\r\nantelope, the antelope, and the gazelle. Of the birds, I may mention 12\r\nvarieties of pigeons, 2 of sandgrouse, 2 of partridges, 8 of quail,\r\npeafowl, jungle-fowl, spenfowl, bustard, floriken (a kind of bustard),\r\nwoodcock, woodsnipe, common snipe, jacksnipe, painted snipe, widgeon, 4\r\nkinds of teal, and 5 of wild ducks. I may mention that there are 9 kinds\r\nof eagles, 20 kinds of hawks, and 13 varieties of owls. As regards\r\nreptiles, crocodiles are the only ones that sportsmen take any interest\r\nin, and they are to be found in many of the rivers of Mysore. Fish of\r\nvarious kinds are to be found in the numerous large tanks in Mysore,\r\nthough I may add, that some of these pieces of water would elsewhere be\r\ncalled lakes, as they are sometimes upwards of twelve miles in\r\ncircumference. The well-known mahseer abounds in the rivers of the Western\r\nGhauts of Mysore, and gives excellent sport, and in the opinion of some\r\nanglers, superior to salmon fishing. I have said in my first chapter on\r\ncoffee, that the life of a planter to any one fond of nature and an open\r\nair life is an agreeable one, so agreeable that, though from accidents of\r\nfortune no longer dependent on coffee, I still find it the most pleasant\r\nlife in the world, and return to it annually with pleasure, and I think\r\nthat the mere enumeration of the varied forms of animal life, which are so\r\ninteresting both to the sportsman and the naturalist, will go far to\r\njustify my conclusions. Having thus glanced at a part of the fauna of the\r\nprovince, I now proceed to the big game shooting section of my chapter,\r\nbut, before doing so, I may mention that it is stated in the \"Mysore\r\nGazetteer\" (Vol. II., p. 13) that, according to old legends, the lion was\r\nonce to be found in the Province.\r\n\r\nOf elephants, and elephant shooting, I have had no experience. In Mysore\r\nand in British India they are reserved by the State which, from time to\r\ntime, captures the elephants by driving them into large inclosures, and\r\nthere is a record of one of the sales of captured elephants in my second\r\nchapter. But the reader need not regret my want of experience here, as it\r\nwould be difficult for any one to add to the admirable and exhaustive\r\naccount of elephants and their ways which is to be found in the late Mr.\r\nSanderson's[15] admirable work. His death is really much to be lamented,\r\nfor he was not merely a destructive sportsman, but an intelligent and\r\nsympathetic observer of the wild animals he lived amongst, and I think I\r\nam only repeating current opinion when I say that a more admirable and\r\ninteresting work of its kind never was written. Mr. Sanderson, I may\r\nmention, was specially employed by Government to superintend the capture\r\nof herds of elephants, and also to hunt man-eating tigers, and tigers of\r\nobnoxious character.\r\n\r\nTigers, as to which I shall have, I am afraid, rather too long an account\r\nto give, are fairly numerous in the forests of the Western Ghauts, and\r\nsome other parts of the country, if I may judge by the fact that rewards\r\nwere paid for 68 in 1874, and for 100 in 1875, but in former times they\r\nwere much more numerous in certain parts of the province, a fact which is\r\ntestified to by General Dobbs, who when a young man was in civil employ in\r\nthe Chittledroog division of Mysore in 1834. He mentions in his\r\n\"Reminiscences of Life in Mysore\"[16] that his division was infested with\r\nwild beasts and, to reduce their numbers, he obtained from one of the\r\nofficials a plan of a pit 12 feet long, 12 feet deep, and 2-1/2 feet wide,\r\nclosed with brushwood at both sides and one end. Wooden spikes were fixed\r\nat the bottom, and the top of the pit was covered over with light\r\nbrushwood. A sheep or goat was then tied inside at the closed end, where\r\nthere was standing place left for it. As tigers usually spring on their\r\nprey they are thus sure to fall through the light brushwood into the pit.\r\n\"In a short time,\" writes the general, \"48 royal tigers were thus\r\ndestroyed, four of which were brought to me on one morning. Mr. Stokes,\r\nthe superintendent of the Nuggur division, obtained from me the plan of\r\nthese pits, and in an equally short time caught upwards of 70 tigers. Now\r\ncomes a circumstance which I can vouch for, but cannot explain. In a short\r\ntime the success in both divisions terminated, and never again did a tiger\r\nfall into one of these pits, though numbers of tigers continued to infest\r\nthe country.\" One result of the success obtained is worth recording. The\r\nbalance of nature had been destroyed; the tigers to a great extent lived\r\non wild pigs, and these, after the destruction of the tigers, multiplied\r\nso rapidly that the general records that there was an increased\r\ndestruction of extensive sugar plantations. And I may note in passing,\r\nthat the balance of nature may equally be destroyed from the other end of\r\nthe line, and tigers made much more destructive than they otherwise would\r\nbe. This is remarkably so near the western passes of Mysore, for never\r\nwere tigers more numerous or destructive than they have recently been in\r\nmy neighbourhood, and this is clearly to be traced to the great\r\ndestruction[17] of deer, pigs, and bison by the natives in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the great forests, a subject to which I shall afterwards have\r\noccasion to allude.\r\n\r\nThe sudden spread amongst the tigers of the news about these pits is\r\nreally very remarkable. We know that animals and birds are taught by\r\nexample and experience to avoid certain dangers--that birds, which are at\r\nfirst killed in considerable numbers by telegraph wires, gradually learn\r\nto avoid them, and that hares which are at first excluded by rabbit\r\nnetting in the course of time take to jumping it, but it is certainly\r\nimpossible to explain by anything we know as regards the spread of\r\nexperience amongst animals as to how the news could spread amongst the\r\ntigers, over a tract of country about half as large as Scotland, for traps\r\nwere set in two out of the four divisions into which Mysore was then\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nIt has often been a subject of remark that tigers, without any motive that\r\nwe can even guess at, avoid certain parts of the country which, to us,\r\nseem to be equally favourable to them. This is remarkably so in my\r\ndistrict in Mysore, parts of which, apparently quite as suitable for\r\ntigers as other parts, have never been known to hold one. It is also\r\nremarkable that they invariably cross from one range of hills to another\r\nby almost exactly the same route, at least such is my experience. These\r\ntiger passes as they are called by the natives are well known to them.\r\nThere is one about a mile and a half to the north of my bungalow, and\r\nanother at about the same distance to the south, and between these two\r\npoints I have never heard of the track of a tiger being seen except on one\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIt seems singular that, as so much has been written about tigers, there\r\nshould be any dispute as to the way in which the tiger usually seizes its\r\nprey, but I find that Mr. Sanderson differs widely from Captain Forsyth,\r\nand Captain Baldwin and others, and says that, though the tiger does\r\noccasionally seize by the nape of the neck in the case of his having to\r\ndeal with very powerful animals, his usual method is to seize by the\r\nthroat; and another sportsman of great experience tells me that, though he\r\nhas seen hundreds of kills, the seizure was always by the throat. In my\r\npart of the country it is so much the usual method for the tiger to seize\r\nby the nape of the neck, that a native, when asked if he is sure that it\r\nwas a tiger and not a panther, always puts his hand to the back of his\r\nneck, and if he says that the animal was seized by the throat, we\r\ninvariably assume that the seizer is a panther. As Mr. Sanderson was a\r\nmost careful observer, I cannot doubt the correctness of his experience,\r\nand as little can I doubt the experience in my neighbourhood. But this\r\napparent discrepancy may easily be explained, and I regard it as probable,\r\nor even quite certain, that tigers may vary their method of attack in\r\naccordance as they live mainly on game or mainly on village cattle. In the\r\ncase of a bison, a wild boar, or of a large and powerful village buffalo,\r\nMr. Sanderson admits that the seizure is by the nape of the neck, and that\r\nno doubt is the rule with the forest tigers, such as those that have been\r\nkilled near my estate, and which have lived mostly upon game, but I can\r\neasily conceive that tigers that have lived on village cattle would attack\r\nin a different way.\r\n\r\nThere is also another difference between Mr. Sanderson and other sportsmen\r\nas to the tiger killing animals with a blow of its paw. Mr. Sanderson does\r\nnot in the least believe that the paw is so used, but Captain\r\nWilliamson[18] considers the paw as \"the invariable engine of\r\ndestruction.\" \"I have seen,\" he says, \"many men and oxen that had been\r\nkilled by tigers, in most of which no mark of a claw could be seen.\" I\r\nhave not paid much attention to this subject, but I do recollect one\r\ninstance of a bullock that had been killed by a blow of the paw, as I\r\nremember being struck by the fact that there was no apparent cause of\r\ndeath, but on a closer examination I found a wide bruise, evidently from\r\nthe tiger's paw, on the side of the head. A friend of mine of great\r\nexperience tells me that he has known of animals being killed by a blow\r\nof the paw. That men are commonly killed by a blow of the paw on the head\r\nI have little doubt. Captain Williamson mentions a case that occurred in\r\nhis presence, and I knew of a doctor who had examined seven bodies, and in\r\neach case the skull had been fractured by a blow of the paw. General\r\nRice,[19] when giving an account of the seizure of Cornet Elliot, mentions\r\nthat he had a narrow escape from a blow of the tigress's paw, which he\r\nguarded off with his uplifted rifle. The stock of the rifle was marked\r\nwith the claws, while the trigger and guard were knocked completely flat\r\non one side, so that the gun was useless until repaired. There is no\r\ndoubt, then, that the tiger can, and does sometimes, use his paw with\r\ndeadly effect, though I have little doubt that he prefers to use his\r\nteeth, as the shock of a blow to the paw must, in the case of a bullock at\r\nany rate, be very considerable.\r\n\r\nThe carrying power of tigers is very great, and has often been remarked\r\non, but it has been doubted whether they often carry off an animal without\r\nsome part of it dragging on the ground. Mr. Sanderson gives some instances\r\nof their doing so; and I have known of one instance in my neighbourhood\r\nwhere a tiger after killing a bullock took it into the jungle and carried\r\nthe carcase along the trunk of a tree which had fallen across a ravine.\r\nBut considering its size, the dragging power of a panther is much more\r\nremarkable, and it seems to carry off a bullock as easily as a tiger does.\r\nOn one occasion a panther killed a donkey close to my bungalow, and\r\ncarried it off, and had even attempted to jump up the bank of an old ditch\r\nwith it, which was five or six feet high, but had failed in the attempt\r\nand abandoned the carcase. But why the panther did not drag the donkey\r\ndown to another part of the jungle, where it could easily have dragged the\r\ncarcase into it, is difficult to conceive, unless we suppose that these\r\nanimals have not, after the failure of one plan, mind enough to try\r\nanother. Perhaps this is so, or that they take the pet in a case of\r\nfailure and go off in disgust. I imagine that this kind of feeling must\r\ninfluence tigers, for I once found an uneaten carcase of a bullock wedged\r\nbetween two rocks. A tiger had killed, high up on a mountain side, and\r\ntaken the carcase into the nearest ravine, evidently with the view of\r\ndragging it towards the water further down the hill. On his way he had to\r\npass through a narrow passage between two rocks, and here the carcase\r\nstuck fast, and he had in vain tried to pull it through, but it had never\r\noccurred to him to pull it out backwards (which he might easily have done\r\nwhen the carcase was only slightly wedged) and try another route. But,\r\nafter all, we must not be surprised, at this, as even the human animal\r\ndoes not always readily find the solution of a fresh difficulty. Tigers,\r\nit is well known, are good swimmers, and seem to have no difficulty in\r\ntaking the carcase of a bullock with them, if I may judge by the fact,\r\nwhich was told me by a friend, that a tiger once swam eighty yards across\r\na river in the northern part of Mysore, taking with it the carcase of a\r\nnewly killed bullock.\r\n\r\nTiger shooting in the Western Ghauts is always carried out without the aid\r\nof elephants, and it is seldom that one can obtain, even for the first\r\nshot, a fairly safe position. Colonel Peyton, whom I have previously\r\nquoted, says that a man is not safe under sixteen feet from the ground,\r\nbut it is seldom that such an elevation can be obtained, as the country is\r\nso steep that, though you have a fair drop on the lower side of the tree,\r\na tiger from the upper side may easily spring on to you, and is then\r\ngenerally on your level, or even higher. Of course you select a tree\r\nwhere, in theory, the tiger must come on the lower side, but tigers will\r\noften take most eccentric courses, and last year, after having taken up a\r\nposition on a tree which had a drop of eight feet on the lower side, and\r\nwhere it was assumed by all of us as certain that the tiger would pass\r\nlower down the hill, it came on the upper side, on rather higher ground\r\nthan the cleft I was sitting on, and so close that I could have touched it\r\nwith a spear, and had I not fatally crippled it at the first shot, it\r\nmight easily have jumped on to me. But I entirely agree with Colonel\r\nPeyton that it is always best for several reasons to get into a tree, even\r\nthough it may not be a high one, or indeed into a scrubby tree so low that\r\nyour feet are only some five feet from the ground. In the first place, you\r\ncan command a wider view, then you are concealed, and can let the tiger\r\npass your line, and as the tiger could pass under your feet you are not in\r\nhis way, and there would be little chance, if you reserved your fire till\r\nhe had passed, in his either attacking you or being driven back on the\r\nbeaters. Colonel Peyton, whom I quote with great confidence, is in favour\r\nof a bamboo ladder with broad rungs to sit on, and which will enable you\r\nto have your feet eleven feet from the ground. To illustrate the risk of\r\nsitting on the ground, I may mention the following incident:\r\n\r\nMany years ago news was brought that a tiger had killed cattle some six or\r\nseven miles off. The distance was considerable, the news came late, and it\r\nwas, I think, about three in the afternoon when I reached the spot. The\r\nbeaters were all ready and impatient, no doubt, owing to being kept\r\nwaiting so long, and as I did not wish to delay them, and had no ladder,\r\nand there was no suitable tree, I took a seat on the ground behind a bush\r\nwhich lay on one side of, and about twenty yards from, a depression in the\r\nland through the bottom of which, by all the laws of tigers, the tiger\r\nought to have passed to the main forest beyond. I had no sooner seated\r\nmyself than I saw, from the lay of the ground, that if the tiger should\r\nhappen to break at a point in a line with my bush he would probably gallop\r\non to the top of me before it would be possible to make more than a snap\r\nshot. I at once left the spot and climbed a small tree on the opposite\r\nside of the depression, and this enabled me to have my feet some five feet\r\nfrom the ground. Presently the beat began, and with a roar, and an evident\r\ndetermination to charge anything in his way, a very large tiger broke\r\ncover at full speed and went exactly over the very spot of ground I had\r\nbeen sitting on. At the pace he was coming at I do not indeed think he\r\ncould have stopped himself, and I hardly think I should have had time to\r\nfire, and I have often wondered what would have happened had he galloped\r\non to myself and my man. However, as it was, I was all right, fired just\r\nas he passed the bush and knocked him over with one shot, and put another\r\ninto him as he got half up and struggled into the jungle, apparently with\r\nhis back broken, and lay down about a few yards aside of it. And now by a\r\ncurious coincidence we just missed what must have been a very serious\r\naccident, and this is well worth mentioning, as it confirms what another\r\nwriter has said as to the care that should be used in approaching a tiger\r\nsupposed to be dead.\r\n\r\nAfter the beat was over the beaters rushed up, and one of the natives, who\r\nhad no doubt seen the tiger from a point on the hill above, said, \"His\r\nback is broken, and he must be dead; let us go in and drag him out.\"\r\nFeeling that it would be better to wait a little longer to make quite\r\nsure, I said, just to quiet them, \"Stand the people in line and count them\r\nfor the division of the reward.\" I had not counted more than five when up\r\ngot the tiger close to us with a startling roar, and I then experienced\r\nwhat Colonel Peyton has said, namely, that there are very few even of the\r\nstanchest sportsmen who will not draw back a pace or two at the sudden\r\nroar of a wounded tiger. On this occasion I removed more than that, for I\r\nat once seized a rifle and ran several yards up the hill to gain the\r\nadvantage of the ground, and I need hardly say that there was a slight\r\nscatter amongst the unarmed natives. But as the tiger did not charge out,\r\nI saw that he was probably off, and at once ran down the side of the\r\njungly ravine to head him, and at the first break in the jungle got up\r\ninto a tree. The tiger almost immediately appeared on the opposite side of\r\nthe ravine, going steadily along, and showing no signs of being wounded\r\nwhatever, and I fired at, but missed him, partly on account of my awkward\r\nposition in the tree and partly from excitement. Then I ran on to the next\r\nopen break in the jungly ravine, and again got up into a tree. By this\r\ntime the beaters came up in the rear of the tiger, who refused to go\r\nfurther down the ravine, or was unable to do so, and the natives sent to\r\nme to go up and attack the tiger in the jungle, to which I replied by\r\nrequesting them to be good enough to forward the animal to me. However, as\r\nhe refused to move, and it was getting late, I went up the ravine, and\r\nthey pointed out the tiger, which was lying on its side. I fired a shot at\r\nit, when it got up, then I fired another at once, and it fell and died\r\nalmost immediately. This was by far the largest tiger ever killed in our\r\ndistrict, and an old sportsman who had seen much of shooting during a long\r\nresidence in India told me that he was sure he had never seen a larger\r\nskin, and did not know that he had ever seen one as big. As evidence of\r\nsize, he attached, I may mention, great importance to the width of the\r\nskin of the tail just at its junction with the body. The paws of this\r\ntiger, too, were remarkably larger than those of other tigers. I found\r\nthat the first bullet had taken effect in the neck, which it had no doubt\r\ngrazed with sufficient force to paralyze the tiger for a time, and Colonel\r\nPeyton records a similar case where great risk had been incurred from\r\napproaching a tiger apparently dead, but where the spine had been merely\r\ngrazed.\r\n\r\nWhat I have previously mentioned illustrates one danger from sitting on\r\nthe ground, and I may give another instance which occurred to me in 1891.\r\nI had gone after a tiger, and my shikari had prepared an excellent seat on\r\na tree at an absolutely safe height. The tiger, however, had shifted his\r\nground, it appears, to an adjacent jungle. This consisted of one long and\r\nrather deep ravine, with several spurs at which the tiger might break. It\r\nhad several times previously happened that tigers had come up the bottom\r\nof this ravine, and I had once killed one there from a tree in the jungle,\r\nbut the trees so situated are difficult to ascend, and we did not wish to\r\nmake a noise nor to waste time by making a ladder, so I determined on\r\nsitting on the ground in the jungle, about twenty yards from the bottom of\r\nthe ravine, and made myself perfectly comfortable. While keeping an eye on\r\nthe bottom of the ravine up which the tiger was expected to pass, I was\r\nsuddenly startled by a roar from some little distance behind us. My old\r\nshikari at once saw the danger we were in, and looked extremely disturbed,\r\nand no wonder, for he saw at once that the tiger had been driven back by a\r\nstop at one of the spurs, and might come down on us from behind, so that\r\nwe should have had no chance of seeing him till he was almost on the top\r\nof us, and as a matter of fact he did pass down into the ravine rather\r\nhigher up and just out of our sight, and from this we failed to dislodge\r\nhim. On the whole, for every reason, I am much against sitting on the\r\nground. You are liable to be run into sometimes, as we have seen, and at\r\nothers you are not high enough up to command the ground, and there is a\r\ngreater chance of driving a tiger back on the beaters. There are, however,\r\noccasions when one must sit on the ground, and if you have occasion to do\r\nso, it is of course advisable always to try and get about twenty or\r\nthirty yards on one side of the course the tiger is likely to take, and\r\nalways let him pass your line of fire before firing. It is also of great\r\nimportance to have as your second man one who can remain absolutely\r\nmotionless when a tiger is advancing towards him. To illustrate the\r\nimportance of this I may mention the following incident:\r\n\r\nI was posted one day in a tree, when the tiger charged back through the\r\nbeaters with a roar, and I had at once to get down and run to another\r\npoint of the jungle to cut him off. I then tried to get up a tree on the\r\ngrass land near the edge of the jungle, and next tried another a little\r\nfurther off, but could not got up into it, and when the beat recommenced\r\nthere was nothing for it but to sit down beside a bush about one hundred\r\nyards from the jungle, and on ground on almost exactly the same level as\r\nthe tiger would have to traverse. But this bush was so small that it only\r\npartially concealed me, and the entire body of my native second gun-bearer\r\nwas exposed to view. This man fortunately had a most remarkable power of\r\nsitting absolutely motionless under any circumstances which required\r\nstillness. I also was fully prepared to remain quite still, and arranged\r\nmyself so as to fire at the tiger when he was exactly in front of me. It\r\nwas interesting to observe what followed. The tiger was evidently an old\r\nhand. He had anticipated our plan, and charged back through the beaters,\r\nas we have seen. He had also evidently anticipated the alterations we\r\nshould probably make, and when the beat recommenced he cautiously emerged\r\nfrom the jungle and looked up (it is a rare thing for a tiger to do this)\r\ninto the tree near the edge of the jungle into which I had tried to climb.\r\nHe seemed then to be quite satisfied that all danger was at an end, and\r\nstrolled leisurely towards us. As he was passing the point which put the\r\nwhole bush between me and him, I cautiously levelled my rifle, which I\r\nalready had in almost exact position to fire, so that when he came into my\r\nfull view I had the sight on the second stripe behind the shoulder. By a\r\ncurious coincidence he stood quite still when he came into my full view,\r\nand, as he was only about twenty yards away, presented a very fine sight.\r\nBut I reserved my fire till he had moved forward a pace or two, and then I\r\nfired, and on he bounded. Then followed one of those picturesque,\r\nexciting, and somewhat amusing scenes, which can only occur in tiger\r\nshooting on foot. For the leisurely proceedings of the tiger had given the\r\nbeaters time to get to the end of the cover just as I was firing at the\r\ntiger, and as I ran round the hillside to the other side of a ravine which\r\nran down the hill, they ran forward so rapidly and plunged so suddenly\r\ninto the jungle, that the tiger came out just below me. I fired at him,\r\nand so did one or two of the natives who had run up to join me, and the\r\ntiger fell dead in the air in the middle of a long bound. But running and\r\nexcitement are not favourable to accuracy of aim, and the tiger, on this\r\noccasion, was struck by only one ball, and, strange to say, in the sole of\r\nthe foot, and the only bullet-mark on his body was from my first shot at\r\nhim. My account of the incident may be valuable to an inexperienced\r\nsportsman, and illustrates also the peculiar disadvantage of sitting on\r\nthe ground, because if the tiger had walked straight up to me, and I had\r\nfired at him in the face, which I should have been obliged to do, he\r\nwould, if not killed outright, probably have either gone back amongst the\r\nbeaters, or charged me.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to my second gun-carrier on this occasion as being a man\r\nwho had the greatest power of remaining still under all circumstances, out\r\nshooting, when it was necessary to do so, and I may also mention that he\r\nwas a man who combined the greatest coolness with the greatest daring. He\r\nwas of a Hindoo peasant family, entered my service as a workman, rose to\r\nbe a duffadar or overseer, and for many years has been head overseer on my\r\ncoffee estates, and he is as good as a planter as he is as a shikari. I\r\ncould give many instances of his cool daring. On one occasion a wounded\r\ntigress--it was the cold weather season, when everything was still green\r\nabout the edges of the jungle--went into a ravine which was flanked by a\r\ngreat bed of ferns about five feet high. The natives looked at this bed\r\ninto which the tigress had disappeared with considerable doubt, and one of\r\nthem said, \"How is anyone to go in here?\" \"I will show you,\" said Rama\r\nGouda quietly, and he picked up several large stones, threw them into the\r\nferns, and then plunged into them. I afterwards killed the tiger on foot\r\nin the ravine, but of course he ran the risk of coming upon it in the\r\nferns. But the coolest thing I ever knew him to do was when a manager of\r\nmine wanted to fire at a tiger as it was approaching him. It was in the\r\ndays of the muzzle-loaders, and as Rama Gouda knew that to speak would be\r\nfatal, he quietly but firmly put both his fingers on the caps when my\r\nmanager presented the gun at the tiger, and kept them there till the tiger\r\nhad reached the proper point for action. Then he withdrew them, and my\r\nmanager killed the tiger. It is contrary to all rule, on account of the\r\nbeaters, to fire at a tiger till he has passed you, and as the manager and\r\nRama Gouda were seated on the ground, if the tiger had been fired at face\r\nto face an accident might have occurred. On only one occasion did I ever\r\nsee him disturbed, and that was when he took up a position at a beat for\r\nbig game. Presently he heard a hiss, and on looking round found a\r\nreared-up cobra about to strike at his naked thigh. He saved himself by a\r\njump on one side, but he showed by his eye when he mentioned the\r\ncircumstance that he had been somewhat commoved.\r\n\r\nThe natives have an idea that a tiger will not attack a group of from\r\nfour to five people massed together, and in 1891 four or five unarmed\r\nnatives proposed that I should sit on an absolutely bare piece of ground,\r\nand that they should sit round me, and that the tiger should be driven up\r\nto us. But this offer, and more especially as I had only one gun, I\r\ndeclined, with thanks, unless they could find a small bush or piece of\r\nrock to sit behind, and as neither could be found, I took up a position on\r\na steep hillside and on a scrubby tree, which I thought safe enough, as I\r\nassumed that the tiger would pass on the lower side of it, but it\r\napproached close on the upper side, and on rather higher ground, and could\r\neasily have sprung on to me, as it was not more than fifteen feet distant,\r\nthus again illustrating how difficult it is in a hilly country to get into\r\na reasonably safe position. Altogether, the risks of tiger shooting in a\r\nhilly country where elephants cannot be used, and where you may have to\r\nrun to cut off a wounded tiger or follow one into the jungle, is attended\r\nwith risk even to the most experienced. The amount of that risk is\r\ndifficult to determine, but I may say generally it is such that while\r\nbachelors, or married men of independent means whose families are well\r\nprovided for, in short, people whose lives are of no cash value, may\r\nfreely go into the jungle on foot after wounded tigers, and generally\r\nthrow themselves in the way of the animals, I do not consider it right for\r\na married man, whose family is dependent wholly or partially on his\r\nexertions, to go after tigers on foot, or without the aid of elephants,\r\nfor though a man may resolve to stick to safe positions, they are often\r\ndifficult and sometimes impossible to find, and the excitement soon does\r\naway with all feelings for one's personal safety.\r\n\r\nThough I have no doubt that it is, generally speaking, true that a tiger\r\nwill not attack a group of four or five people, I am not at all sure that\r\nthis is correct as regards a wounded tiger, and a tiger I had wounded once\r\nsprang into a party of I should say at least twenty people, and killed\r\none of them--at least the poor man died in the course of a few hours. I\r\nalways regretted that I did not obtain and preserve his belt. At the back\r\nof it was the iron catch with which to hitch his wood-knife, and the\r\ntiger's tooth had grazed one side of the iron, and cut it as if one had\r\nworked at the iron with a steel file. Another instance too occurred of a\r\ntiger attacking a party, or at least one of a party which was approaching\r\na tiger. Several tigers, it appeared, had been marked down, and the jungle\r\nin which they were was surrounded by nets. This was done in Mysore on the\r\narrival of the Russian princes some years ago, but one of the tigers had\r\nmanaged to elude the shooters, and, as the native magistrate of the\r\ndistrict was anxious to have it killed, a sporting photographer who was\r\nthere undertook to look it up. As they approached the thicket in which the\r\ntiger was concealed the tiger rushed out with a sudden bound, aimed a blow\r\nwith its paw at the leading native, tore his scalp right off and flung it\r\non to a bush, bit the man in the arm, and retreated into the thicket with\r\nsuch suddenness that no one had time to fire. The poor man afterwards\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nThe great danger from following up wounded tigers on foot in the jungle\r\narises from the extraordinary difficulty of seeing the animal when it is\r\nlying amongst dry fallen leaves, into which the body partially sinks, and\r\nthis is more particularly the case if there is a flickering sunlight\r\ncoming though the branches of the jungle trees. In one case of this kind,\r\nthough I could see the tiger when it half raised itself up--it had been\r\nwounded in the back--I failed to pick it up the moment it sank back into\r\nthe leaves; and my shikari told mo of another similar case he had seen\r\nwhen there was a similar flickering light. But even without that source of\r\nconfusion to the sight a tiger is extremely difficult to see, as difficult\r\nas a hare in a ploughed field, or perhaps more so. On one occasion Rama\r\nGouda said to me, when we were attacking a wounded tiger, or rather\r\ntigress in the jungle, \"There is the tiger.\" \"What!\" I said, \"that thing\r\nlooking like a stone?\" The light was bad. We both supposed it to be dead,\r\nbut I said, \"I suppose I had better take a shot at it,\" and did so, and,\r\nwhen the smoke cleared away, found that the tiger had removed. Then a\r\nnative went forward and gently parted the reeds with his hands, and showed\r\nme the tigress--which had moved about twenty yards--on her side, and\r\nevidently in a dying condition. She was now only a few yards from me, and\r\nI fired at her, and she rolled over and died. As it happened, I do not\r\nthink that I ran much risk, but one never can exactly tell how much\r\nvitality a dying tiger has, and in the case previously alluded to I have\r\nno doubt that the tiger must have died immediately after he made his fatal\r\nattack on the party.\r\n\r\nIt is owing obviously to their great power of concealment that tigers are\r\nso very rarely ever seen by accident, and Mr. Sanderson says that during\r\nsome years of wandering in tigerish localities he has only come upon them\r\naccidentally about half a dozen times, and my own experience, and that of\r\nother sportsmen to whom I have spoken, quite confirms this. But I am\r\npersuaded that a native can see a tiger much more readily than a European,\r\nand the former have, I think, much better distinguishing power. For\r\ninstance, a European has great difficulty in seeing a green pigeon in a\r\ngreen tree till the bird moves, while a native seems to have no such\r\ndifficulty. My own sight is, or rather was, very good, but I found on one\r\noccasion, when I was stalked by a tiger, that it was most provokingly\r\ndefective as compared with that of a native. The incident occurred in this\r\nway. In cloudy weather, during a break in the monsoon, I was beating a\r\nravine for game, and had sent my second gun-carrier with the beaters. As\r\nthe beat was drawing to a close, I heard a sambur deer belling at the head\r\nof a ravine, about a few hundred yards from the termination of the jungle\r\nwe were beating. As I thought I might get a shot at it, I went across the\r\ngrassland in the direction of the sound, and up to within about ten yards\r\nof the edge of the jungle, the fringe of which at that point projected a\r\nlittle. I could see nothing, but as the people were coming my way in any\r\ncase, I remained where I was. The first person to arrive was a very plucky\r\nHindoo peasant--a keen sportsman and splendid stalker--and when he almost\r\ntouched me he at once pointed and said \"There is a tiger.\" I put my rifle\r\nto my shoulder, and said to him \"Where?\" \"There,\" he said, and as he put\r\nhis hand on my shoulder I could feel it trembling with excitement. Alas, I\r\ncould not make out the tiger; but, after all, that was not so very\r\nwonderful, as the day was dark, and the underwood fringe rather thick, but\r\nthe tiger actually managed to back gradually away without my being able to\r\nsee him. He had evidently been stalking the sambur, which had uttered the\r\nnote of alarm I had heard, and no doubt seeing that there was something at\r\nthe edge of the jungle, had crawled to the edge, and there lain down\r\nwithin ten or twelve yards of me.\r\n\r\nTigers seem to recover easily from wounds, and so completely, that no\r\ntrace of a bullet having entered the body can be found. On one occasion I\r\nshot a tiger, and when the skin was being removed we perceived a lump on\r\nthe inner side of it. This we opened, and found that it contained a bullet\r\nwhich a brother of mine had fired into the tiger about a year before. We\r\nhad no difficulty in identifying the bullet, as no other rifle in the\r\ncountry had anything like it. The tiger was perfectly well and fat, and\r\nhad not a mark on it of having been previously wounded, and yet the bullet\r\nhad gone close to mine, which proved fatal to the tiger. In 1891 I killed\r\na tiger, which had evidently, from his action, been hunted before. He was\r\nin unusually good condition, and yet had a piece of lead in him, which\r\nappeared to be a fragment of an express bullet. But a friend of mine tells\r\nme that he has often found old bullets in tigers. It is a surprising thing\r\nthat tigers and panthers seem often to be little influenced by wounds, and\r\nI have heard of one case of a panther, for which a sportsman was sitting\r\nup, which returned to the kill after being wounded and fired at several\r\ntimes. A friend of mine was once out small game shooting on the Nilgiris\r\nwhen a tiger seized one of his dogs. He at once put a ball cartridge into\r\nhis smooth bore, had a beat, and wounded the tiger. On the following day\r\nhe returned to the spot with his rifle, and again beat the jungle, when he\r\nkilled the tiger, which had returned and finished the dog, and then found\r\nthat the bullet of the day before, which had struck the tiger in the\r\nchest, had travelled nearly the whole length of the body. I recollect once\r\nshooting a spotted deer which had a matchlock ball lying up against its\r\nliver, and pressing on it, but the deer, though it had good horns, was\r\nrather a stunted animal.\r\n\r\nI have previously remarked that, in the opinion of Colonel Peyton, even\r\nthe stanchest sportsman when on foot in the jungle, is liable to be\r\nstartled by the sudden roar of a wounded tiger close at hand, and so much\r\nso as even to draw back for a pace or two, but he says that the effect is\r\nonly momentary. In 1891 I again had an opportunity of observing the\r\neffects on myself and others of the roar of a wounded tiger in the jungle,\r\nbut on this occasion, though I confess I was very considerably startled,\r\nand generally commoved for a moment, as I had expected to find the tiger\r\ndead, I did not step back a pace, nor did the stanchest of the natives who\r\nwere with me, though a certain number climbed right up to the tops of\r\ntrees. As it happened, there was, after all, no danger, for the tiger had\r\nbeen damaged in the back, and I soon dispatched it. The effect of the roar\r\nof a tiger is really very remarkable, and of this the animal itself seems\r\nto be well aware, for the tiger I have just alluded to--evidently an old\r\nhand, from the trouble he had given us and the cunning he had\r\ndisplayed--remained in the open, or came out into the open as the beaters\r\napproached, then roared at them and afterwards retreated into the\r\njungle--a narrow ravine in which he seemed determined to remain, though\r\nshots were fired into it, and in which I think he would have remained had\r\nnot the beaters charged into it in a body in the most plucky manner. A\r\nfriend of mine also met with a similar instance, where a tiger came\r\nout--confronted the beaters and roared at them. The beaters may see the\r\ntiger, and quite close, and yet not be much disturbed, but a roar even a\r\ngood way off has on them a disturbing effect, though it is difficult to\r\nsee why the nerves should be affected more easily through the medium of\r\nthe ears than the eyes. I may here mention that, when the sportsman has a\r\ndamaged heart, the roar of a wounded tiger, at least if the shooter is on\r\nfoot in the jungle, is apt to produce a slight flutter of that organ,\r\nthough that, too, like the effect alluded to by Colonel Peyton, is\r\nmomentary. Having had for some years a rather damaged heart, I was\r\ninterested in experimenting as regards the effects of tigers on its\r\naction, but could come to no very distinct conclusion. I was once in an\r\nextremely insecure position on a conspicuous cleft of a bare tree, with my\r\nfeet not more than seven or eight feet from the ground, when the tiger\r\ngalloped into the arena as it were in the most sudden manner, and passed\r\nwithin fifteen feet of me. I knocked him over with a ball in the back at\r\nthe second shot--the first, from the awkward position I was placed in,\r\nhaving either missed, or done him little harm. The tiger then lay on his\r\nside, with his head turned backwards and resting on his shoulder. He kept\r\nhis eye on me, and I kept mine on him, and I did not fire again, as my\r\nsecond gun native (we had never expected the tiger to be where we found\r\nhim, and were on our way home) had seated himself on another tree. In a\r\nlow tone he said to me \"Load, load!\" but the moment I took my eye off the\r\ntiger to do so he began to wriggle into the jungle, and I only got a snap\r\nshot at his hind leg. Now when the tiger roared, which he did as he\r\napproached me, and he lay watching me, I felt no sensation of the heart,\r\nthough I felt a distinct flutter when loading and when the tiger was\r\nwriggling away. On the following day, however, I felt my heart to be\r\nrather the worse, but I attributed this to exposure to the sun. On another\r\noccasion, which occurred shortly afterwards, I shot a tigress so close\r\nthat I could have touched her with a spear, and she was on rather higher\r\nground than myself, but on this occasion neither when I fired, nor when\r\nshe fell, and turned her head to me and showed me all her teeth, did I\r\nexperience any heart effect whatever. I must say, though, that I had my\r\nattention strongly turned to the necessity of not allowing myself to be\r\nexcited, in case it should be bad for my heart, and the power of the will\r\nmust no doubt have much effect in controlling the action of the heart.\r\nAnyone who has anything the matter with his heart should take digitalis\r\nbefore going out, and also take a few doses of this tonic with him, as\r\nwell as some very strong beef-tea. He should also endeavour to go after\r\nthe tiger in the morning or late in the afternoon, and lie in a cool place\r\nin the jungle in the heat of the day, as I am quite sure, from my own\r\nexperience, that exposure to much sun heat is bad for the heart. As heart\r\ndisease, from the excitement of life, is becoming more common, these hints\r\nmay be useful.\r\n\r\nSince writing the preceding, I went out after a tiger near my house,\r\nwhere I was placed on a tree quite out of the reach of a tiger--in fact it\r\nwas too high, and showed me the great disadvantage of being more than say\r\nfifteen feet from the ground. The beat was a peculiar one, and I was\r\nposted just inside the jungle. The beaters were rather long at their work,\r\nand I had fallen into a reverie, from which I was aroused by three roars\r\nof a tiger just behind me, and the roars were not charging roars, but of a\r\ncharacter which meant, in tiger language, that people had better look out.\r\nNow the tiger was below me, and I was as absolutely safe as a man at home\r\nin his armchair, and yet I felt my heart throb quickly. The explanation of\r\nthis no doubt was that I had forgotten to take my dose of digitalis before\r\nstarting. Being in the jungle I was under great disadvantages from having\r\nto shoot through the underwood, and, though I knocked over the tiger, and\r\nthere was plenty of blood to prove it, we lost him.\r\n\r\nThis tiger is known as the lame tiger from being so in the right fore\r\nleg--the result of an old wound probably--and some ten days after my\r\nwounding him a curious coincidence happened. A young married lady, who was\r\nat the time on a visit to my bungalow, had expressed a great wish to see a\r\ntiger, and, when leaving for Bangalore in her bullock coach between nine\r\nand ten o'clock one night, very nearly saw the lame tiger. He was standing\r\nin the road some miles from my house, at a sharp bend where the road\r\ndeflects abruptly to cross a Nullah, and waited till the coach got within\r\nten or fifteen yards of him, whereupon, after delivering three moderate\r\ngrowls, he limped down off the road, and stood for a moment looking at the\r\ncoach and bullocks.\r\n\r\nAll sportsmen must regret the necessity for tying out live bait for\r\ntigers, but this is really a fully justifiable proceeding, as thereby an\r\nimmense amount of pain is saved to animal life in general, and an immense\r\nsum of money to the native population. The destruction of cattle by\r\ntigers is really enormous, and, I believe, far exceeding that reported to\r\nGovernment, and it is so mainly because the tiger is only allowed to eat a\r\nfraction of what he kills, as the moment that news of a bullock being\r\nkilled reaches the village, the low class natives at once proceed to the\r\nspot, drive away the tiger, and carry off the beef. And this is only\r\nprevented when an English sportsman is within reach, in which case the\r\ncattle owners prevent the people from touching the carcase. It is often\r\nvery annoying when tying out baits for tigers, to find them destroyed by\r\npanthers, as the panther, of course, from his habit of climbing trees, and\r\nconcealing himself in the foliage, and from a kind of general facility\r\nthat he seems to have for getting out of the way, is a difficult animal to\r\nfind, in fact so much so, that I latterly would never go out after one,\r\nunless it had killed quite close at hand. In 1891 I was once much annoyed\r\nto find that a new kind of bait with an additional attraction had been\r\nquite ruined by a panther. This attraction consisted of a goat picketed in\r\nan open-topped (that was the mistake, it ought to have been closed) wooden\r\ncage which was placed in the branches of a tree, on the edge of the\r\njungle, and about fifteen feet from the ground, while a bullock was\r\npicketed on the ground in the open land, about twenty yards away. The\r\ntheory was that the, to a tiger, attractive aroma of the goat would be\r\nwidely diffused, and that he might, too, further attract the tiger by his\r\ncries. News (false as it afterwards turned out to be) was brought in that\r\na tiger had killed the bullock, and I toiled up on to the mountain some\r\nseven miles away from my bungalow, merely to find that a panther had\r\nkilled the bullock and that my goat was hanging dead by the neck outside\r\nthe cage just like a carcase in a butcher's shop. The panther had seized\r\nthe goat, killed it, and jumped out of the cage with it, and had either\r\nnot sense enough to cut the rope with his teeth, or had his suspicions\r\naroused from finding the animal tied. To show that the suspicions of an\r\nanimal can thus be aroused, I may mention the following incident, which is\r\nalso especially interesting as showing the great skill of the tiger as a\r\nstalker and the singular power he has of stepping noiselessly on dry\r\nleaves, and his power to do mischief after being apparently shot dead. But\r\nbefore doing so I may mention rather an interesting circumstance. Besides\r\nthe bait killed by the panther, I had two bullocks tied out in the\r\nneighbourhood, and as I did not care much for that part of the country,\r\nordered them to be released and brought home with us. I was much struck\r\nwith the earnest and business-like air with which these poor animals,\r\nwhich had spent some miserable nights in the jungle, expecting every\r\nmoment to be killed by a tiger, trotted along, on a line often parallel\r\nwith the party, and it somewhat reminded me of a picture I had seen in an\r\nillustrated paper, of the hunted deer amicably trotting home with the\r\nhounds and huntsmen. The fact was that they were determined to get home in\r\ngood time, for fear, I suppose, of being shut out of the cattle shed, and\r\nthough, just as they neared the shed, the remainder of the herd, which had\r\nbeen out grazing in the neighbourhood, appeared within twenty yards, the\r\nliberated baits got first into the shed. And now for my story showing how\r\neasily the suspicions of the tiger are excited.\r\n\r\nA near neighbour of mine--at least he lived ten miles off---was much\r\nannoyed by tigers which, from the continuous nature of his large block of\r\nevergreen forest land, he could only get at by sitting over a bait. On one\r\noccasion he had tied out a bullock, in a piece of land of a few acres\r\nwhich he had cleared in the middle of the forest, and concealed himself on\r\na tree. It was during the day, and the ground was covered with dried\r\nleaves which are so brittle in the hot weather that even the scratching,\r\nor walking of a bird can be heard some way off. Presently a large\r\ntiger--my friend knew that he was about--made his appearance and commenced\r\na stalk so elaborate and careful that my friend declared it would have\r\nbeen worth 1,000 rupees to a young sportsman to have witnessed it. He put\r\nevery paw down so carefully, gradually crushing the leaves under it, that\r\nmy friend, though quite close to the tiger, could not hear a sound.\r\nBetween the tiger and the bullock was the butt, about four feet high, of a\r\nfelled tree, with long projecting surface roots, and this saved the tiger\r\nmuch trouble, for he got on to one of the roots, and carefully balanced\r\nhimself on it, and so without noise was able to walk quickly along till he\r\ncame to the butt which he seemed to wind round like a snake, and he then\r\ngot on to a corresponding root on the other side, and walked along that.\r\nIn short, he approached so gradually and noiselessly, and his colour\r\nagainst the brown dry leaves was so invisible, that he got quite close to\r\nthe bullock before it perceived him. The moment it did so it charged, but\r\nthe tiger, avoiding the horns, swung round the back of the bullock, and\r\nthen sat up and put both its paws on its neck evidently to drag it down,\r\nbut it then perceived that the animal was tied, and at once turned and\r\nsprang into the forest with such rapidity that my friend did not fire. He\r\nhowever sat patiently on, and after a considerable time the tiger\r\nreappeared, went through the whole stalking performance as carefully and\r\nexactly as before, and was seen and charged by the bullock as before. But\r\nthis time the tiger was in earnest and seized the bullock. There was a\r\nstruggle, the rope broke, and the bullock dropped dead, and then the tiger\r\nstood for a few seconds, a magnificent figure in the bright sunlight,\r\nlooking all round as it were for signs of danger. Whether the tiger saw or\r\nsmelt my friend is uncertain, but it suddenly lay down behind the bullock,\r\ninterposing the carcase between itself and my friend, and resting its\r\nhead on the body. As it is always more or less precarious to fire at the\r\nhead of an animal where it may suddenly move my friend waited to get a\r\nbody shot, but as the tiger had evidently no intention of moving he fired\r\nat the head and the tiger was apparently shot dead on the spot. But my\r\nfriend, who was an experienced sportsman, waited a little, and in the end\r\nthought it safe to fire another shot before going up to the tiger. He did\r\nso, when the tiger sprang up and went off into the forest at full speed,\r\nand fell and died at some little distance away. The first bullet had\r\nstruck the tiger below the eye, but had been deflected, and was found\r\nlodged in the jaw. My friend thinks that it would have proved fatal to the\r\ntiger, but that is doubtful, as tigers make such wonderful recoveries from\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\nIn tying out baits it is very important to use a chain instead of a rope,\r\nas the tiger will commonly cut the latter and carry off the carcase, and\r\nit is sometimes desirable, or even necessary in some cases, to sit over\r\nthe carcase and await the return of the tiger. The latter is always the\r\ncase where there are great continuous forests, where tigers cannot be\r\nisolated, or successfully pursued, unless one has an army of men and many\r\nguns. This form of sport, which Mr. Sanderson speaks highly of, I can\r\nimagine may be very interesting, but it is also very tiresome and\r\ntantalizing. A great many years ago I remember trying it for two nights,\r\nbut without any success, and never again tried it till some years ago,\r\nwhen I made an attempt in one of the forests at the foot of one of the\r\npasses leading down to Mangalore. My people had no experience in the\r\nmatter either, still we might have been successful had the carcase been\r\nchained. I took down a small herd of cattle from my plantations, and\r\nordered some baits to be tied one evening, and early the following morning\r\nwent round to look at them. In the first case we found that the rope had\r\nbeen cut and the bullock carried off and deposited in a depression in the\r\nground about fifty yards away. The carcase was untouched. In the next case\r\nwe found that the rope, which was a very strong jungle creeper as thick as\r\na large-sized rope, had not been cut, but that the animal had been killed,\r\nand merely a few steaks as it were eaten from the rump. In the third case\r\nwe found that the bullock, which had evidently been the first one seized,\r\nwas about half eaten. In the fourth case the bullock, which was an old\r\none, had not been touched. I think my people made a great mistake in tying\r\nout so many cattle so close together--they were not one hundred yards\r\napart--still this certainly made matters more sure from one point of view,\r\nas a tiger crossing the country might have missed one bait, whereas he\r\ncould hardly have missed four, but his having killed three baits made our\r\nproceedings a little mixed. I first ordered the surviving bullock to be\r\ntaken home, and two of the carcases to be dragged away to a considerable\r\ndistance, and resolved to sit over kill number two, as it was the best\r\nanimal, and in the most convenient position, but unfortunately I ordered\r\ntwo of my people to take a seat on a tree near the place where number one\r\nhad been killed and carried off, and the tiger, which went there first,\r\nlooked up and saw them and growled. His suspicions of course were aroused,\r\nand the result was that he did not come at all to the kill I was sitting\r\nover--at least while I was there. After it was too dark to see to shoot I\r\nwent home, and returned the following morning, when I found that the tiger\r\nhad returned, cut the rope, and carried off the bullock to a distance of\r\nabout two hundred yards, and eaten a good deal of it. I organized a small\r\nsilent beat of a section of the forest, but nothing came of it. My head\r\nman then resolved to prepare a watching place in a tree near the carcase,\r\nand this time I resolved to follow Mr. Sanderson's advice, and begin to\r\nwatch quite early in the afternoon. My man finished his arrangements by\r\nabout midday, and, after breakfasting at home, I returned with him to the\r\nspot at about three o'clock. Horror of horrors, the carcase was gone\r\nagain. My head shikari--the Rama Gouda, whom I have previously noticed as\r\nbeing such a cool and daring fellow--was enraged beyond measure. He at\r\nonce, without saying a word, cut a creeper from the nearest tree, and\r\nwithout even a gun in his hand set off on the trail, but not, I observed,\r\nbefore gun-bearer number two, also a daring fellow, had looked at him with\r\nan inquiring eye, as much as to say, \"are you not a trifle rash?\" I\r\nfollowed Rama Gouda, though I was not quite sure of the prudence of our\r\nproceedings, and presently we perceived by the chattering of a squirrel\r\nthat the tiger was moving along close to us. Then we came to the carcase,\r\nof which there was now only about half left, and from the tracks about it,\r\nand the quantity of flesh eaten, Rama Gouda was satisfied that the tiger\r\nmust have watched him making his preparations and then carried off the\r\ncarcase the moment he had left. Rama Gouda now lashed the creeper to the\r\nbullock's horns, and, with the aid of the second man, proceeded to drag it\r\nback to the watching place he had prepared, and which was about one\r\nhundred yards away. By this time, the hinder part of the bullock had been\r\neaten and only the fore part was intact and the carcase smelt horribly.\r\nThere was something so ludicrous in the whole thing that I could not, and\r\nmuch to Rama Gouda's surprise, help laughing. The unfortunate animal had\r\nfirst been driven thirty miles from his home into these remote forests,\r\nthen killed, then his remains were carried off as we have seen, and then\r\nagain carried off, and now what was left was being dragged back again to\r\nthe watching place. Rama Gouda soon arranged matters to his satisfaction\r\nby restoring the remains to their original position, but certainly not to\r\nmine, for there presently arose a most asphyxiating stench, which seemed\r\nto fill the entire air, and reminded one of what soldiers must often have\r\nexperienced in our eastern campaigns. We waited till it was too dark to\r\nsee to shoot and then went home, and early next morning I had to start for\r\nthe coast, and thus ignominiously ended the only attempt of the kind I\r\never made. The tiger was evidently an old hand and was playing a regular\r\ngame of hide and seek with us. The great error made was the neglect of Mr.\r\nSanderson's advice as to chaining the bait in the first instance. Some\r\ntigers always carry off the carcase each time they visit it, and a friend\r\nof mine told me that when he was once sitting over a carcase, the tiger\r\nmade a sudden rush, picked up the carcase in the course of it, and made\r\noff so suddenly that he had no time to fire.\r\n\r\nI can easily understand that, as Mr. Sanderson says, there is a\r\nconsiderable charm and interest connected with this method (and in some\r\ncases it is the only method) of pursuing tigers, but I can see that it\r\nrequires much experience, caution, and patience, and I would particularly\r\nadvise those interested in this matter to consult Mr. Sanderson's valuable\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI have often found in conversation that people are surprised to find that\r\ntigers eat tigers when a suitable opportunity for doing so presents\r\nitself, but considering that man still, in some parts of the world, eats\r\nhis fellow man, it seems to me extremely natural that a tiger should eat a\r\ntiger. I have, however, only met with one instance which occurred in my\r\nneighbourhood, and in this case I am strongly inclined to think that the\r\neaten tiger was first of all killed. The incident occurred in this way.\r\nShortly before my arrival in India one winter, my manager wounded a tiger,\r\nbut I do not think very severely, as the tiger not only travelled at least\r\ntwo miles, but ascended a mountain up to a considerable elevation. Along\r\none side of the mountain is a rather long strip of forest, which is a\r\nfavourite place for tigers either to pass through or lie up in, as it is\r\nquite out of any village-to-village route, and had the tiger been hard hit\r\nhe would certainly have remained there. But not only did he not do so, but\r\nskirting the jungle, or passing through it, he climbed up a steep ascent,\r\nevidently with the view of going into the next valley, and near the top of\r\nthe ascent his living history ends. Knowing from the direction taken by\r\nthe wounded tiger that he would probably be in the jungle on the mountain\r\nside, my manager had it beaten on the day following, when a tiger came out\r\nwhich he took to be the wounded tiger, and which he killed. It then turned\r\nout that it was not the wounded tiger, but a fresh tiger with the wounded\r\ntiger, or nearly all the meat of it, inside him, and all that was\r\nrecovered was the head and the skin of the chest, which I saw after my\r\narrival, and which was sent in to Government for the reward, and by the\r\nsize of the head it must have been a fine tiger. When I visited the jungle\r\nin 1891, I carefully cross-examined the natives in the matter, and they\r\nsaid that they could not say whether the tiger had died from wounds or\r\nwhether he had been killed by the tiger that had carried off and eaten the\r\nbody, but they were positive that it was a tiger that had eaten the body,\r\nfrom the tracks, for the body had been taken down to water, on the margin\r\nof which no other tracks but those of a tiger were visible, and these were\r\nclearly defined. They could also be distinctly traced from the place in\r\nthe open grassland whence the body was carried. Taking all the\r\ncircumstances into consideration--the distance travelled, the steepness of\r\nthe ground, and the fact that the tiger passed a favourable jungle for\r\nlying in, I am strongly of opinion, in fact, I consider it almost certain,\r\nthat the wounded tiger must have been dispatched by the other tiger, which\r\nwas hungry and could not resist the smell of the blood. There is nothing\r\nremarkable in a tiger eating a tiger found dead, and I have read and heard\r\nof instances of this, and also of tigers fighting, and the vanquished\r\ntiger being eaten.\r\n\r\nIt is a common idea that tigers cannot climb trees, but this has arisen\r\nfrom the fact that they have seldom occasion to do so. Mr. Sanderson\r\nmentions the case of a tigress having been seen to climb a tree in a wood\r\non the Nilgiri Hills, and though he has never seen a tiger in a tree\r\nhimself, deprecates the idea of there being anything impossible in the\r\nmatter, and if we come to consider that the large forest panther, which\r\ncommonly ascends trees, is really often nearly as heavy as a small-sized\r\ntigress, there is nothing at all improbable in the tiger doing so. I\r\nmyself have never seen a tiger in a tree, but one of my managers did, who\r\nonce went out after a tiger which he had wounded. He then ran on to cut\r\nhim off, and tried to get up into a tree, but not succeeding in the\r\nattempt, went and took a seat some way off on the hillside. The tiger\r\npresently emerged from the jungle, went to the tree and began roaring and\r\nscraping at the ground, and he must have either smelt traces of the\r\nmanager or seen him trying to get up into it, and concluded he was there.\r\nHowever, he deliberately went up the tree paw over paw, and got into a\r\ncleft of it and looked about in the tree, and then came down backwards,\r\nand was shot in the act of descending. I sent and obtained measurements of\r\nthis tree, the stem of which was 16-1/2 feet up to the first branch. The\r\ntiger climbed up so far, and looked around in the tree. Another case was\r\ntold me by Rama Gouda, to whom I have previously alluded, of a wounded\r\ntiger going up a tree to get at a beater, whom he nearly reached. In the\r\ncase just mentioned, the tiger rose on its hind legs and deliberately went\r\nup paw over paw, but in the second, started with a spring up the stem of\r\nthe tree, and then ascended in the same way as the first tiger did.\r\n\r\nThere is a common idea that jackals attach themselves to tigers, and are\r\nuseful in warning them of danger, and I have been informed by an\r\nexperienced sportsman that they always howl when they find a bait tied out\r\nfor a tiger, and, it is supposed, with the view of informing any tiger\r\nwithin hearing that there is a bullock all ready for him. I have never\r\nheard but one confirmatory instance of the former, which was told me by a\r\nplanter on the Nilgiri Hills, who was opening some new land in quarters\r\noccasionally visited by tigers. One evening, after the day's work was\r\nover, he went out accompanied by a kangaroo dog, and took a seat on the\r\nhillside to enjoy the view. Immediately below him ran a jungly ravine, and\r\nbehind him the hill rose sharply. He had no gun with him, not expecting\r\nany game so close to his new abode, and now, to his dismay, a large tiger\r\nemerged from the shola at a point between him and his bungalow. As the\r\ngrass was long at that season, the tiger did not perceive my friend (and,\r\nas I have previously shown, tigers, and I believe all animals, do not\r\nreadily perceive any non-conspicuous object which is not in motion), who,\r\nas may be supposed, sat as close and still as possible, and beckoning to\r\nthe dog, held him fast by the collar. The tiger lay down in the grass, and\r\nwas presently followed by another tiger, which lay down in front of the\r\nfirst and rolled over on its back. This was pretty well for a beginning,\r\nbut presently, one after the other, emerged three smaller tigers, which\r\nalso took their seats in the grass. Here then was a nice family to have\r\nbetween one and one's dinner. The sun presently set, and the prospect of\r\ndarkness was not encouraging. My friend naturally waited for the tigers to\r\ngo, and no doubt devoutly hoped that they would not come his way, but time\r\nseemed to them to be of no importance, and they showed not the slightest\r\ndisposition to move. Presently there came on to the ridge of the hill\r\nabove a jackal, which looked down upon the party and then set up a most\r\nunearthly howl. The three smaller tigers, evidently young and\r\ninexperienced animals, took no notice of the protestations of the jackal,\r\nbut the two larger tigers at once got up and took a long steady look at\r\nhim, and the jackal moved restlessly about and seemed to redouble his\r\nefforts to attract the attention of the tigers. The larger tigers now\r\nseemed satisfied that some danger was at hand, and to the immense relief\r\nof my friend, walked down into the jungle, followed by the three smaller\r\ntigers. After waiting a little my friend got up and proceeded homewards,\r\nand, he said, \"I am not ashamed to own that, after passing the place where\r\nthe tigers had disappeared from view, I fairly ran for the house.\" The\r\nmost interesting experiences one hears of tigers and other wild animals\r\nare, as may be supposed, not from sportsmen engaged on shooting\r\nexpeditions, and who have killed much game, but from pioneer planters and\r\nothers whose business lies in tigerish localities, and that is why Mr.\r\nSanderson's book is so particularly interesting. My friend told me when I\r\nlast met him that he had only killed two tigers, but that he had had\r\noccasionally some unexpected interviews with them. One of these was\r\ninteresting as showing that a tiger does not like the rearing of a horse.\r\nMy friend was riding across the country one morning when he came suddenly,\r\nat the edge of a shola, on a tiger, which at once crouched as if to\r\nspring. The horse, an Australian, wished to turn, but my friend, being\r\nafraid that the tiger might then spring on him, turned his horse's head\r\ntowards the tiger and touched him with the spur. This caused the horse to\r\nrear, and the moment he did so the tiger turned tail and ran off. We have\r\nseen that man does not relish the roar of a tiger, and it may be\r\ninteresting to record one instance where a single tiger was commoved and\r\nput to flight by the yell of a single man. He was a planter on the\r\nNilgiris, and the brother of a friend of mine, and was in the habit of\r\ngoing out at the end of his day's work with a book and a gun, and seating\r\nhimself on the hillside to look out for sambur deer. On one occasion he\r\nwas thus sitting in the long grass when he heard something coming through\r\nit. This turned out to be a large tiger which came into view suddenly, and\r\nquite close, as may be supposed from the fact that the planter was sitting\r\nin long grass. The tiger at once crouched, and the planter was afraid to\r\nraise his gun, as it was probable that the animal might spring at him\r\nbefore he was ready to fire. Tiger and man thus looked at each other in\r\nsilence. Mr. B. had heard of the effect of the human eye, and he threw\r\ninto his the fiercest glare he could, but found that the tiger returned\r\nhis glance quite unmoved. Then he thought he would try the effect of the\r\nhuman voice, and gathering himself together uttered the most awe-inspiring\r\nyell he could command. The tiger at once rose to his legs and turned his\r\nbody half round. This was encouraging, and he emitted another yell, when\r\nthe tiger went off.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that tigers, like men, are often very undecided how\r\nto act, and it would be interesting if we could penetrate their state of\r\nmind. Shall I attack, or shall I do nothing? and in the end, after long\r\ndeliberation, the tiger will determine on doing nothing, and walk off. Of\r\nhis state of mind the following is an instance. On one occasion I left my\r\npony on the side of a hill just outside the forest, and went for a stalk\r\nover the mountain above. I could see nothing, and thought it would be well\r\nto take a seat and wait in case any game might turn up. I had not been\r\nseated more than a few minutes when one of my people, pointing downward,\r\nsaid, \"There is a tiger,\" and we could see him at the foot of the hill\r\nabout quarter of a mile away, walking steadily across a piece of open\r\nland to the forest beyond. Just as he disappeared my horse-keeper came up\r\nalone, and evidently in a most agitated state, and no wonder, for we had\r\nno sooner got out of his sight when, a tiger appeared from the jungle and\r\nlay down on the ground just above the pony and crouched. The horse-keeper\r\nhad another man with him, but he not unnaturally said that he was afraid\r\nto come and tell us, as he thought that there was safety in numbers, and\r\nthat the tiger might attack the pony if it was left with only one man. The\r\ntiger must have thus remained in a state of low doubt for at least half an\r\nhour. Finally he got up and left them, and, from the direction he took,\r\nwas evidently the identical tiger which we had seen from the hill top.\r\n\r\nTigers, like wolves and other animals, form plans, communicate them to\r\ntheir companions, and conjointly carry them out. A friend of mine was once\r\nthe subject of an excellent instance of this. He was out stalking one day,\r\nand with his glass was scanning the country carefully, when he made out a\r\nlong way off, in a piece of open grassland which was surrounded by forest,\r\nthree tigers looking in his direction. They evidently saw that there was\r\nsomething on the hillside, but the distance was, for them, too great to\r\nmake out what. After steadily looking at him some time the tigers\r\nevidently formed their plan of operations, and plunged into the forest\r\ntowards him. The tigers had taken my friend and his man for game of some\r\nkind, and had determined on a united stalk and drive, and, when they\r\nappeared, two remained at the edge of the jungle, while the third made a\r\ncircuit evidently with the view of coming upon the supposed game from\r\nabove. But presently they discovered their mistake and went off.\r\n\r\nThese forest tigers are rarely dangerous to man unless attacked, and in\r\nmy part of the country they never are so. However, there is no rule\r\nwithout an exception, and when making this assertion to some natives in my\r\nneighbourhood many years ago, one of them said, \"I am not so sure about\r\nthat. A tiger ate an aunt of mine not far from here some years ago.\" But\r\nthat is the only instance I ever heard of in my neighbourhood, and even by\r\ntradition there were no instances of deaths from tigers, and it is also\r\nremarkable how in some cases tigers, when there is plenty of game, live\r\nfor years near cattle without touching them. I was particularly struck\r\nwith this in the case of a family who lived quite isolated at the crests\r\nof the Ghauts, and the head of it told me that, though tigers were often\r\nabout they never touched his cattle. There is an amusing story told in \"My\r\nIndian Journal\"[20] (a charming book which everyone should read who is\r\ninterested in India) of a native who was ready enough it appears to track\r\ndown tigers to be shot by others, but who by no means wished that any of\r\nhis family should interfere. On one occasion Colonel Campbell found him\r\nbelabouring his son with a stout bamboo, and on inquiry learned that the\r\nsaid son had killed a tiger. The father said it was all very well for\r\npeople who lived in the open country, but with him the case was quite\r\ndifferent, as he lived on sociable terms with the tigers in the jungle,\r\nhad never injured them nor they him, and while there was peace between\r\nthem he could go amongst them without fear, but now that his rascally son\r\nhad picked a quarrel with them, there was no knowing where the feud might\r\nend.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned a case of tigers not interfering with cattle when there\r\nwas plenty of game, but I should add that this was many years ago, when\r\nthe natives had not so many guns as they have now. The rice-fields have\r\nbeen abandoned and the house of course deserted, and of recent years the\r\ntigers have changed their ways, for, ten years ago, I killed a tigress\r\nclose to the site of the abandoned house, in the neighbourhood of which it\r\nhad been killing cattle.\r\n\r\nI have said that forest tigers are rarely dangerous to man, and by that I\r\nmean the tigers inhabiting the long range of forests stretching along the\r\nsouth-western side of India at varying distances from the sea, but in the\r\ninterior of Mysore very dangerous man-eaters have existed, and I have been\r\nshown places which people made up parties to cross. One man-eater, at\r\nleast--for it was assumed that the deaths were the work of one\r\nanimal--killed, I am informed on good authority, about 500 people. Two\r\ntigers were killed at one time, and after that the slaughter of human\r\nbeings ceased, though it was never ascertained which was the culprit.\r\nThere is no man-eater at present in Mysore. Mr. Sanderson says that bold\r\nman-eaters have been known to enter a village and carry off a victim from\r\nthe first open hut. The boldest attempt I ever knew of was mentioned to me\r\nby my Nilgiri planter friend, and it occurred in this way. In the middle\r\nof the night there were loud cries of \"Tiger!\" from a hut near his house\r\nwhich was occupied by some of his people. He always kept a loaded gun near\r\nhim at night, and at once rushed out and fired, when two men came up to\r\nthe bungalow and declared that a tiger had begun to claw the thatch off\r\nthe roof of the hut in order to get at them. This was alarming to the\r\nplanter, as, if proved, many of his people might have left the place, and\r\nhe told the men to sleep in his veranda, and that he would see in the\r\nmorning if their story was true. He then went to bed and rose very early\r\nthe following morning, before anyone was about, and found that the story\r\nwas quite true, and saw the tracks of the tiger. These he carefully\r\nobliterated, and then went back to bed. Then when he rose at his usual\r\ntime he roused the men and asked to be shown the track of the tiger. This\r\nof course they could not do, and he laughed off the whole story, and\r\ntreated it as a fanciful illusion. I find many stories in sporting books\r\nof the great courage and determination often shown by natives in\r\nconnection with tigers, but my Nilgiri planter friend told me one which\r\nwas really astonishing. A tiger one day had carried off a Toda cattle\r\nherd, and his friend or relative was determined to recover the body, and\r\nwas about to proceed single-handed and unarmed into the jungle with this\r\nview. My friend saw that he could not prevent him, and as he did not like\r\nto let him to go in alone, went with him. They went in accordingly, and\r\npresently heard the tiger crunching the bones of his unfortunate victim,\r\nbut when the tiger heard them approaching he retired, and the Toda\r\nrecovered what was left of the body. There can be no doubt, however, that\r\nthe death of one of a party does exercise a chilling effect on the zeal of\r\nthe natives, or at least on a considerable proportion of them, but after\r\nall this is not surprising, as I have found a similar coldness coming over\r\nmy own proceedings when a tiger has retorted with effect on his pursuers.\r\nOn the occasion I am now alluding to an unfortunate report had spread that\r\na tiger I had wounded had left the jungle in which we found him, and\r\nwhither he had retreated. I had wounded the tiger in the evening, and we\r\nwent to look him up next morning, and the beaters, influenced no doubt by\r\nthe report in question, went into the jungle in a body in a careless\r\nmanner, and without sending men up trees to keep a look out ahead.\r\n\r\nThe tiger waited till the whole party was within springing distance, and\r\nthen with a tremendous roar which I clearly heard at my post some way off,\r\ncharged, and buried his deadly fangs in the back of an unfortunate Hindoo\r\npeasant who was leading the way. The poor fellow was carried out of the\r\njungle in an evidently dying state, and a caste dispute arose over him,\r\nthe particulars of which I have given in my chapter on caste. After doing\r\nwhat we could for him we placed him on a rough litter and he was carried\r\nto the rear. I confess that after such an exhibition of temper on the part\r\nof the tiger and the nature of the jungle I, being Europeanly speaking\r\nsingle-handed, was not so very comfortable at the idea of approaching him,\r\nbut luckily a toddyman who had run up a tree (these men are wonderful\r\nclimbers) when the tiger charged, and was afraid for some time to come\r\ndown, now emerged from the jungle, and reported that he could see the\r\ntiger from the tree he had climbed into. This of course much simplified\r\nmatters, and I at once proceeded into the jungle, but only about ten\r\npeople, mostly my own followers, cared to accompany me. As it happened, we\r\nafter all ran no risk whatever, as the tiger was dead, though he was lying\r\nwith his head on his paws in such a life-like position that we fired a\r\nshot into him to make sure. When we were skinning him the poor man\r\nexpired. In the same jungle, I think about a year afterwards, an English\r\nvisitor at my house wounded a tiger, which went into one of those reedy\r\nand cactus-grown bottoms which make tiger shooting on foot so dangerous. I\r\nthen declared that none of my people should go into this, and that they\r\nmight return the next day and see if the tiger was dead (by no means an\r\nabsolutely safe proceeding even then as we have seen). Much to my\r\namusement a lean toddy drawer of mine, an excellent shikari, went a few\r\nyards into the swampy ground, got on to a small boulder of rock, squatted\r\ndown, took out his betel bag, threw some betel into his mouth preparatory\r\nto chewing, and then held out his long skinny arm and forefinger and said,\r\n\"Look! A tiger made a meal of a man close to this last year. Let everyone\r\ntherefore be careful and get up into trees, and mind what they are\r\nabout.\" The next day the tiger was found dead quite close to the rock he\r\nhad been squatting on. A most remarkable instance of courage on the part\r\nof a native occurred when a brother planter of mine was out tiger shooting\r\non the Ghauts to the north of my abode. A tiger flew at a Hindoo\r\npeasant--a first-rate plucky sportsman, and as the tiger charged, the man\r\nstruck at it with his hacking knife (a formidable weapon in the hands of a\r\nman who knows how to use it, and used to cut underwood, and thick boughs\r\nof trees), with the result that the tiger's skull was split open and the\r\nanimal killed on the spot. The native was thrown backwards with great\r\nforce, and his head came in contact with a stone. He got up, and by this\r\ntime was surrounded by the people, when, holding out his hand, he said,\r\n\"Look here,\" and then paused. Everyone expected some remark about the\r\ntiger, but, amidst general laughter--for the natives have a keen sense of\r\nhumour--he continued, \"There will be a bump on my head to-morrow as big as\r\na cocoanut.\" And now, as we have heard so much of the courage of man, it\r\nis time that the dogs should have their turn, and I will conclude these\r\nreminiscences with an account of how a dog saved the life of the brother\r\nplanter to whom I have just alluded. I was so much interested in the story\r\nthat I wrote down the particulars in my diary at the time and read them\r\nover to my informant to make sure they were right. I give the account\r\nverbatim as I took it down at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. A. told me that he once wounded a tiger which afterwards sprang on\r\nhim, knocked him down, and seized him by the hand and arm. With Mr. A. was\r\na large dog, half mastiff and half polygar (a savage and rare native\r\nbreed), which at once attacked the tiger, and diverted its attention from\r\nMr. A. After driving off the dog the tiger again returned to Mr. A. and\r\ncommenced to worry him, but was again attacked by the dog. The dog was\r\nthus driven off about three or four times by the tiger. The tiger was all\r\nthis time losing strength from his wounds, and the last time he returned\r\nto Mr. A., died on him. The dog was uninjured. Now comes the most curious\r\nand interesting part of the story.\r\n\r\nThe dog, which was not affectionate generally, and indifferent to being\r\nnoticed, belonged to Mr. A.'s brother, and had previously taken no\r\ninterest in anyone but his master, but after this event, he refused to go\r\nhome with his master, and stuck closely to the wounded man, and when some\r\ncarbolic was applied by Mr. A.'s brother which caused pain to the wound,\r\nthe dog began to growl and showed signs of displeasure. The dog would not\r\nallow anyone to come near Mr. A. except his own special servant, and lay\r\nunder the bed with his nose sticking out, and keeping close guard. When\r\nMr. A. was carried to the doctor some thirty-five miles away the dog went\r\ntoo, and on the doctor applying carbolic, and setting the bones, which\r\ncaused pain, the dog at once seized the doctor by the leg. (Evidently\r\nlooking on him as tiger No. 2, I suppose.) In about three months Mr. A.\r\nwas quite cured, and after that the dog lost all interest in him, and\r\nreturned to his master; and if he met Mr. A. by chance, merely\r\nacknowledged him by the faintest wag of his tail. A year afterwards this\r\ndog, happening to meet the doctor, whom he had not met since, at once flew\r\nat him and seized him by the trousers.\r\n\r\nOne great danger attending the bite of a tiger is that of blood-poisoning\r\nfrom the frequently foul state of the animal's jaws, and it is, of course,\r\nof great consequence to cleanse wounds as soon as possible and apply\r\ncarbolic. An engineer in the northern part of Mysore a good many years ago\r\nwas bitten on the thigh by a tiger, and so little hurt that he walked home\r\nand went on with his business as usual, but a few days after he was\r\nsuddenly taken ill and very soon died. Of course there may happen to be no\r\nfoul matter about the tiger's mouth, and a Hindoo peasant wounded when I\r\nwas out with no less than thirteen wounds in the arms--several of them\r\ndouble wounds as the man had thrust his locked arms into the tiger's mouth\r\nto keep him off--completely recovered. He goes by the nickname of Tiger\r\nLinga Gouda, and I always make a point of sending for him when I visit\r\nMysore. On one occasion I was showing the marks of the wounds to a lady,\r\nand said that there were thirteen wounds. \"Thirteen,\" echoed Linga Gouda,\r\n\"There were fifteen, and you have forgotten those two on the head, and I\r\nslept on your bed too,\" he added with an air of great satisfaction--in\r\nfact he seemed to attach more importance to that than to anything\r\nconnected with the transaction. I had given him up my bed because it was a\r\nbroad one, and so most convenient for resting his lacerated arms. The\r\nnatives were certain that he would die, and I felt a great triumph in\r\nbringing him round. The great thing with wounds of that kind is of course\r\nto cleanse them well, and apply carbolic if you have it (I had none on\r\nthis occasion) and afterwards cover the wounds with damp lint, which\r\nshould be kept constantly moist by frequent applications of water. This\r\nwas done in the case I have alluded to. The arms, of course, swelled\r\ngreatly, and the heat arising from them was very great, hence the need for\r\nthe constant application of water. The flow of blood from the arms was\r\nchecked by a tourniquet.\r\n\r\nI never but once heard of a mad tiger. This animal was made over in an\r\ninoculated condition by a friend of mine to the Garden in Bangalore. He\r\nhad caught it when out tiger shooting, and, when on the way to Bangalore,\r\nhe had chained it outside his tent where it was attacked and bitten by\r\nwhat turned out to be a mad Pariah dog.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter I must say a few words, which perhaps\r\nought to have been said at an earlier period, as regards one of the most\r\nimportant points of tiger shooting--i.e., that of taking up such a\r\nposition as will enable you to fire to right or left without moving your\r\nbody, or rather I should say without moving it more than in a most\r\ninfinitesimal degree, for, as I have previously shown, it is movement of\r\nany kind which alone readily attracts the attention of an animal. It is\r\nevident that, if you sit facing the point from which the tiger is\r\nexpected, though you can readily fire at him without moving if he passes\r\nto your left (and, as has been shown, you should not fire till he is just\r\npassing you) you cannot do so if he passes to your right without turning\r\nyour whole body half round in that direction--a movement which might catch\r\nthe eye of the tiger. To surmount this difficulty Sir Samuel Baker has\r\ninvented a small stool with a revolving top, which is no doubt air\r\nexcellent thing if there is time to erect a suitable platform on which to\r\nsupport the stool, but it often happens that positions have to be taken up\r\nin a hurry, and that you have to sit on the fork of a branch, or on the\r\nground behind a bush or rock, where the tiger may pass on either side. In\r\nsuch cases the shooter should sit facing nearly full face to the right, as\r\nhe can, with hardly any perceptible movement of his body fire readily to\r\nhis left, and he should instruct his man with the second gun to point with\r\nhis finger in order to indicate the side on which the tiger is\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nIn all the books I have read about tigers I have never met with an\r\nallusion to tigers purring like cats from satisfaction, but a brother\r\nplanter informs me that he heard a wounded tiger, that had killed one of\r\nthe natives who was following him up, purr for several minutes, as he\r\ndescribed it, \"like a thousand cats.\" The evening was closing in when the\r\naccident occurred and as the jungle was thick nothing could be done. On\r\nthe following morning the man and the tiger were found lying dead\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nOf all sports tiger shooting affords the most lasting satisfaction, and it\r\nis especially interesting when one lives in tigerish localities where one\r\nhas more leisure and opportunity for going into all the details of this\r\ndelightful sport, and where a knowledge of the people and their language\r\nmakes the sport so much more agreeable, and one's acquaintance with the\r\nground enables one to take an active and intelligent part in regulating\r\nthe plan of operations when a tiger has killed. Then in the case of an\r\nanimal so destructive it is seldom possible to feel any commiseration,\r\nthough I have done so on certainly one, or perhaps two occasions. Against\r\nmany sports something may be said, but that is impossible as regards tiger\r\nshooting. The tying out of live baits may be objected to, but after all\r\nthe tooth of the tiger is to be preferred to the knife of the butcher.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] G. P.

The bear, unlike the tiger,\r\nwhich has sometimes five cubs, appears never to have more than two cubs,\r\nand I have not been able to hear or read of their ever having more. We\r\nhave no means of knowing how often they breed, but I imagine that they\r\nmust seldom do so, and that that is why they are so soon almost\r\nexterminated. As I never kept a game diary on my estate (which I now much\r\nregret), I have no idea how many have been killed from it, but I am sure\r\nwe have killed a smaller number of bears than of tigers, and yet the bear\r\nis now rarely seen or heard of in my neighbourhood, while we hear as much\r\nof tigers as ever, and indeed quite recently a great deal more, for last\r\nyear they were apparently more numerous than they have ever been in the\r\ntiger range of my district; and I say apparently, because, from the\r\ndestruction of game, the tigers have naturally been compelled to live more\r\nupon cattle. It is alleged by the natives that the tigers kill and eat the\r\nbears. Mr. Sanderson notices this in his work, and gives one reported\r\ninstance of it, but I have never known of one in my part of the country. A\r\nfriend of mine, formerly in the employ of the Mysore State, told me that\r\nhe knew of two cases in the North-Eastern Division, of tigers killing\r\nbears, but in neither case did they eat them. In the first case the bear\r\nand tiger had met at a watering-place, and in the second in the jungle.\r\nMr. Ball, in his \"Jungle Life in India,\"[21] tells us that he once came\r\nacross the remains of a bear which the natives said had been killed by a\r\ntiger, and that a native shikari had sat over the carcase with the hope of\r\ngetting a shot at the tiger. We have no returns as regards bears in\r\nMysore, but in the adjacent Bombay districts--Kanara and Belgaum--Colonel\r\nPeyton tells us, in the \"Kanara Gazetteer,\" they are fast becoming rare,\r\nexcept near the Sahyadris, and even there are no longer numerous. In\r\nBelgaum, between 1840 and 1880, he tells us that no fewer than 223 bears\r\nwere killed. The steady decline of the numbers of the bears is shown by\r\nthe fact that 137 were killed between 1840 and 1850, 51 between 1850 and\r\n1860, 32 between 1860 and 1870, and 3 between 1870 and 1880. In Kanara 51\r\nbears were killed between 1856 and 1882, so we have a total then of 274\r\nbears for these two districts alone. As regards big game, the first comers\r\nobviously have the best of it.\r\n\r\nColonel Peyton tells us that the bear is, of all animals, most dreaded by\r\nthe natives. There can be no doubt, he says, that an untouched bear will\r\noften charge, while a tiger will rarely do so, and there are numerous\r\ninstances of people having been mauled and sometimes killed by them. I\r\nimagine, though--in fact, I am sure--that this must often occur from the\r\nbear constantly keeping his head down, evidently smelling and looking for\r\nthings in or on the ground. All other game animals have some motive for\r\nlooking ahead and around--deer and bison for their enemies, and tigers for\r\ntheir prey. But the bear lives on insects and fruits, and flowers and\r\nhoney, and as he is not apprehensive of being attacked by any animal, has\r\nno motive for keeping a lookout, and so does not do so. He may thus, and\r\nno doubt often does, run into a man, under the mistaken idea that the man\r\nis running into or attacking him, and then the bear, naturally, does the\r\nbest he can. I can give a remarkable confirmation of this view.\r\n\r\nOne day, in a break in the monsoon, when the game lies much out of the\r\nforest, I was out in the mountains with my manager for a general stalk,\r\nwhen we saw, some way ahead of us, a bear walking along. We quickly formed\r\na plan of operation, and it was arranged that I should make a circuit and\r\nget between the bear and a jungly ravine he appeared to be making for, and\r\nthat my manager should follow on the track of the bear, which would thus\r\nbe pretty certain to be overhauled. The bear was pottering along as bears\r\ndo, and I had no difficulty in getting between him and the jungle he was\r\napproaching, and the moment I did so I advanced a little towards him. When\r\nthe bear got within shooting distance--about fifty yards--I stooped down\r\nand moved a little on one side so as to get off his direct line, with the\r\nview of getting a side shot, but just as I did so he accidentally altered\r\nhis route, thus bringing himself again head on to me. Then I manoeuvred\r\nagain to get out of his line, but the bear also altered his line, and as\r\nby this time he was getting rather too close--i.e., about ten yards\r\noff--I stood up and took a steady shot at his head and dropped him dead.\r\nNow, strange to say, I do not believe that the bear ever saw me at all,\r\nand he could not wind me, as the south-westerly wind was blowing strongly\r\nfrom him to me, and yet, as the grass at that season was by no means long,\r\nhe had no more difficulty in seeing me than I had in seeing him, and he\r\nprobably would have walked right up to me. This instance is, I think,\r\ninteresting, and goes far to explain the numerous accidents in connection\r\nwith bears. Still there can be no doubt that, as Colonel Peyton says, an\r\nunwounded and untouched bear will deliberately attack people when there is\r\nno occasion for his doing so, and that too, under circumstances where no\r\nother animal would make an attack, and of this the following little\r\nincident will serve as an illustration.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a bear was reported on a jungly hill about a mile from my\r\nbungalow, and as I was young and inexperienced then, I said that I would\r\nlie on the ground till I heard the beaters, and then stand behind a tree.\r\nI was alone, and had only a single barrelled rifle, which I laid on the\r\nground beside me. As the cover was rather a large one, I had no reason to\r\nexpect anything till I could at least hear the beaters in the distance,\r\nand I lay leaning on my elbow and thinking of I cannot now remember what,\r\nwhen on chancing to look up I saw a large bear standing at the edge of the\r\njungle about twenty yards away. The moment I moved he charged, and I at\r\nonce seized my rifle, sprang up and charged the bear at an angle (there\r\nwas no time to fire), and made for the jungle from which he had emerged. I\r\njust missed his nose, and he followed me for a few paces as I ran towards\r\nthe jungle from which he had come, which I did knowing that he would not\r\nbe inclined to go in that direction. Then, having thus cleared me out of\r\nthe way, he turned, and resumed his original route, and as he was\r\ndisappearing into the next jungle I fired at him, but the charge must have\r\nhad a discomposing effect on my shooting, for I missed the bear\r\naltogether. Now, as the beaters were far away and not within hearing,\r\nthere was no occasion for the bear to have attacked me, and there was\r\nample room for him to have altered his line. In fact, unless closely\r\npressed by beaters, no other unwounded animal would have so acted. It will\r\nbe observed that the bear, after having pursued me for a few yards, turned\r\nand went on his way, but had I not been nimble--in other words, had I been\r\ncompletely invested by the bear and thrown down--he might, as the natives\r\nwould phrase it, have made my wife a widow. It is commonly supposed that,\r\nwhen making an attack, the bear stands on its hind legs, and thus gives\r\nthe sportsman a good chance of killing him with a shot in the chest, but\r\nthis is not my experience, and, though instances of the kind may have\r\noccurred, I should not advise the sportsman to count on any such delay in\r\nthe proceedings of an attacking bear.\r\n\r\nThe preceding illustration, I may point out, affords a useful lesson. If\r\nso suddenly attacked by a wild animal that you have no time to fire,\r\nalways rush towards it, and to one side, so that you may, as it were,\r\ndodge past it. This will enable you to gain ground on it, and room to turn\r\nround and fire.\r\n\r\nI may observe that Mr. Ball, in his \"Jungle Life in India,\" gives several\r\ninstances of natives being wantonly attacked by bears, and Colonel\r\nCampbell[22] gives one remarkable instance of two bears attacking a party\r\nof his people, who were on the march through the jungle in Belgaum in\r\ncharge of his horses, one of which was so severely wounded by one of the\r\nbears that the life of the horse was despaired of for some days. The\r\nColonel was determined to be avenged on the bears, had them marked down,\r\nand, with the aid of his friends, bagged them both, but not before one of\r\nthe bears had thrown down one of the party, who ran a great risk of being\r\nkilled. The determination of the bear in following up his assailant was\r\nin this instance very great.\r\n\r\nI may here observe that some little caution is required in approaching,\r\nand looking into caves, and examining the entrances for tracks of bears,\r\nand the person doing so should be fully prepared for a sudden charge out\r\nof the cave, and be ready to jump on one side. No cave should be\r\napproached with the assumption that it is not at all likely that a bear\r\nwill be at home, and especial care should be taken in the case of a cave\r\nwith a drop in front of it over which a person might be hurled by a bear\r\ncharging suddenly out. To get a bear out of a cave is often no easy\r\nmatter, and different caves require, of course, different treatment. In\r\nsome cases the bear may be poked out with the aid of a long pole, and when\r\nthis is done the operation is both interesting and amusing, but care must\r\nbe taken to see that you have a man who understands bears, and knows by\r\nthe character of the growl when the bear really means to charge out into\r\nthe open, and also that the man with the stick can readily get out of the\r\nway, which he cannot do in the case of every cave. The native with a long\r\npole, or rather stick, usually commences with a quiet nervous sort of\r\npoke, which awakes the bear out of his midday slumbers and causes him to\r\nrush at the stick with a furious growl. But this is merely a\r\ndemonstration, and the experienced native does not expect a charge, though\r\nI need hardly say that he is well prepared to get out of the way. Then the\r\nnative commences to poke away in a more pronounced style, and at the same\r\ntime excites himself by calling in question the purity of Bruin's mother,\r\nhis female relations, and even those of his remote ancestors, to all of\r\nwhich the bear responds by growls and rushes at the stick. At last his\r\ngrowls and rushes at the stick become fierce and menacing, and all of a\r\nsudden the experienced Hindoo, who by some instinctive knowledge is able\r\nto gauge the charging moment, drops the stick and scuttles out of the way,\r\nand the bear dashes headlong from the cave to be killed, or to make good\r\nhis escape, as the case may be. Poking a bear out of a cave is rather a\r\nsevere trial of one's nervous system, and if anyone doubts that he has\r\nonly to try it for himself, as it will perhaps show the individual that we\r\nseldom rightly estimate the amount of nerve which we often expect natives\r\nto show. I think I was never more startled in my life than I was one day\r\nwhen I put my ramrod (it was of course in the muzzle loading days) into\r\nthe very narrow mouth of a cave in which I thought there was little chance\r\nof Bruin being at home. A she-bear however was within, and all the fiercer\r\nas she had cubs, but luckily she did not charge out, and I need hardly say\r\nthat I promptly drew back. Sometimes a cave may be so deep and tortuous\r\nthat the bear cannot be got out with the aid of a pole, and to meet such\r\ncases I had stink balls made, as bears have very fine olfactory nerves and\r\nseem particularly to object to disagreeable smells. These balls were\r\ncomposed of asafoetida, pig dung, and any other offensive ingredient\r\nthat suggested itself to me at the time, and made up into about the size\r\nof a cricket ball and then dried in the sun. The ball was, when required\r\nto drive a bear out of a cave, impaled on the end of a long pole and\r\nsurrounded by dried grass, or any other inflammable material which was at\r\nhand, and this being ignited the pole was thrust as far as possible into\r\nthe cave. This I found to be a highly successful plan, and I may mention\r\nin passing that I have met with no account in the many sporting books I\r\nhave read of this being done previously. Sometimes large fires are lit in\r\nthe mouth of a cave with the view of smoking a bear out, but this is\r\nrather a cruel process which I do not recommend. In some cases of\r\npeculiarly shaped and situated caves it is, however, the only practicable\r\nplan, but where adopted the bear should not be put to more inconvenience\r\nthan is necessary to drive him out. A large fire should be lit at the\r\nentrance, and when the cave has got filled with smoke all the blazing\r\nfragments of wood should be removed from the entrance, and in doing this\r\nthe people should talk loudly and make as much noise as possible, and\r\nafterwards retreat to a distance from the cave leaving the sportsman with\r\nhis spare gun-carrier to sit just above the entrance to the cave. The bear\r\nfinding that, as he erroneously supposes, every one has gone away, and\r\nbeing naturally desirous of quitting such uncomfortable quarters will,\r\nafter a short time, come cautiously out and may thus be easily shot. It is\r\nvery important to have a couple of bull-terriers when out bear shooting as\r\nthey are most useful in bringing a wounded bear to bay.\r\n\r\nIn considering these remarks upon the various ways of getting bears out of\r\ncaves it may be useful to show how not to attempt to get a bear out of a\r\ncave, and the connecting circumstances will also be useful to anyone who\r\nmay be overtaken by a hill fire.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion many years ago news was brought in that a bear had been\r\nmarked down into a small and very narrow mouthed cave on a bare hillside,\r\nand I accordingly proceeded to the spot. The whole mountain was at that\r\ntime covered with long grass, and as the cave was closely surrounded by\r\nit, and the bear if poked out in the usual way would rush into the grass\r\nand thus give a bad chance to the shooter, I devised what I thought, and\r\nwhat at first appeared to be, an excellent plan for meeting the\r\ndifficulty. This was to set fire to the whole hill just below the cave,\r\nand my theory was that, as the cave was a small one, the heat of the fire\r\nand the smoke would cause the bear to quit the cave after the fire had\r\npassed over it. The wind was, when we lit the fire, blowing from east to\r\nwest and I perched myself on a pile of rocks rather above, and to the\r\neast of the bear's cave as, when leaving it, he would naturally go in a\r\ndirection opposite to that of the fire, in which case he would pass within\r\neasy shot of my position. With this, distinctly original conception I was\r\nhighly pleased and watched the progress of the terrific conflagration that\r\nensued with interest and satisfaction. How it roared and leapt as it\r\nconsumed the long dried grass, and how soon would the bear be likely to\r\nmake its appearance! It reached the long grass around the cave and\r\nproceeded to sweep along the hill, away from me, and flying before the\r\neasterly wind. Presently there was a dead lull. A few seconds more and the\r\nwhole position was reversed. I had quite forgotten that, at that season of\r\nthe year, and that hour of the day, the east wind dies down, and the\r\nwesterly sea breeze comes in, and in an instant I was caught in my own\r\ntrap. First of all I thought I would screen myself behind one of the rocks\r\nand remain where I was, but I was of course speedily enveloped with masses\r\nof smoke, and then I thought I would get down and run; first of all,\r\nhowever, I peeped over the rock, but merely to perceive a terrifying mass\r\nof roaring red flames rushing towards me, and this finally determined me,\r\nand I stuffed my handkerchief into my mouth and held on. As I had of\r\ncourse leggings and was fully clothed I had much the best of it, but my\r\nshikari with his bare limbs got a pretty good roasting. But the fire\r\nseemed no sooner to have reached us than it was swept onwards quite away,\r\nand I was astonished at the pace it travelled, which one can have no idea\r\nof when one witnesses these conflagrations, as one usually does, from a\r\ndistance. Beyond feeling as if my lungs were on fire for a day or two\r\nafterwards I experienced no ill effects from my temporary roasting, but\r\nthe experience I had was quite sufficient to show me the amount of\r\ninconvenience a bear must suffer from being smoked out of his cave, and,\r\nas I have previously pointed out, no more fire should be lit at the\r\nentrance of a cave than is necessary to make it desirable for the bear to\r\nleave it, which, as I have shown, he will soon do, if the people retire to\r\na distance. As for our bear, he probably knew far more about these hill\r\nfires and the sudden changes of wind than I did, and had not the slightest\r\nidea of coming out for some time, and I therefore had to introduce to his\r\nnotice one of my stink balls, which had the effect of bringing him out. By\r\nway of a change I had intended fighting it out with the bear without\r\nfiring, and told a native to attack the bear with my spear when he\r\nemerged, while I proposed, if he lodged his spear, to attack with the\r\nbayonet of my Enfield rifle. But the spear came into contact with a bone\r\nin the bear's back, and thus the point was broken off, and seeing that my\r\nman had not lodged his spear I fired and killed the bear. From my\r\nsubsequent experience of the great power of the bear I am now glad that\r\nthe spear was not lodged.\r\n\r\nBear shooting from caves I have found to be a most interesting and\r\nsometimes most entertaining and even amusing sport, while it is attended\r\nwith a sufficient amount of danger for all practical purposes. You never\r\nget a laugh out of a tiger shikar, but you sometimes do in connection with\r\nbears, and the following is at once an instance in point, and will besides\r\nillustrate the danger of approaching a cave which is perhaps rarely\r\ninhabited by bears, as also the surprising promptness of the bear in\r\naction. And I say surprising, because from his shambling gait, general\r\ndeliberation of movement, and the clothing of long black hair which hides\r\nthe powerful form and limbs, his activity and quickness of movement when\r\naroused is astonishing to those who have no experience of bears. But to\r\nproceed with my story.\r\n\r\nOne day, when returning from shooting in the mountains, we happened to\r\npass a bear's cave which was rarely inhabited--at least on former\r\noccasions when we examined it we had found no traces of bears, nor had one\r\never been marked into it that I was able to hear of, though the cave had\r\nthe reputation of being occasionally used by bears. The cave was in a\r\nbeehive-shaped pile of rocks standing on, or rather projecting from, a\r\nsteep hillside. From the upper side it is easily approached, but to get at\r\nthe mouth of the cave you have to step down, as it were, from the roof of\r\nthe beehive on to a ledge of rock about six feet wide, below which there\r\nis a drop of ten or twelve feet. From the absence of any signs of bears\r\nabout the roof of the cave I assumed that the cave was as usual\r\nuninhabited, but I thought I would gratify my curiosity by looking into\r\nit, so I got down on to the ledge, and was imprudent enough to leave my\r\nguns with the people on the roof above. As there were no signs of bears on\r\nthe ledge or at the entrance, I told one of the natives to go in and take\r\na look at the cave, but he had only penetrated a few feet from the\r\nentrance, which was about five feet high, than with three furious growls a\r\nbear charged headlong, and drove the intruder out with such force that he\r\nwas shot clean over the ledge, and alighting (luckily) on his side, rolled\r\nsome way down the steep hillside at the bottom of the drop. Bruin then\r\nwith wonderful readiness knocked down the other man, who had not presence\r\nof mind enough to get out of the way, and after inflicting a scalp wound\r\non the back of his head, dropped over the ledge, and got off unharmed\r\namidst several shots which were fired at him by the people above, who of\r\ncourse from their position could not see the bear till he had got to a\r\nconsiderable distance. In the confusion that had occurred amongst the\r\npeople left on the roof of the cave, who were as much unprepared for a\r\nbear as I was, some one had jostled my principal shikari--a testy and at\r\ntimes rather troublesome old man, but a most keen sportsman--and, to the\r\ngreat delight of every one, his shins had in consequence been barked\r\nagainst a sharp piece of rock. All the sympathy that ought to have been\r\ndevoted to the wounded man he diverted to himself by the tremendous fuss\r\nhe made about his injured shins, and this, and the chaff he had to sustain\r\nin consequence, quite rounded off the affair, and we all went home in high\r\ngood humour, and the wounded man for years afterwards used to show his\r\near-to-ear scar with considerable satisfaction. Some people might have\r\nobjected to the escape of the bear, but I confess that I did not grudge\r\nhim the victory he had earned so well, and we consoled ourselves further\r\nwith the reflection that we would get the better of him next time. Before\r\nconcluding the subject of bears, I may give another incident which was\r\nrather amusing, and the narration of which may be of use as illustrating\r\none or two points which are worthy of notice, and especially the advantage\r\nof having a good dog with one.\r\n\r\nOn a mountain-side about five miles from my house is a rather large cave\r\nof considerable depth--so deep, at least, that the longest sticks would\r\nnot reach to the end of it, and as we could get the bear out in no other\r\nway, I lit a large fire at the entrance, and, after some time, sent all\r\nthe people away to a distance, and, with a single man to hold a second\r\ngun, sat over the mouth of the cave. The result that I anticipated soon\r\nfollowed, and, imagining that we had given up our project in despair, and\r\nbeing naturally desirous of leaving such uncomfortable quarters, Bruin\r\npresently appeared looking cautiously about. The smoke prevented my taking\r\na very accurate shot. However, I fired, and wounded the bear somewhere in\r\nthe throat, though not fatally, and he plunged into a jungly ravine close\r\nto the cave, pursued by my bull terrier, an admirable and very courageous\r\nanimal, which attacked the bear, and detained him sufficiently long to\r\ngive me time to run to the other side of the ravine, and so get in front\r\nof the bear. A hill-man accompanied me, armed with a general officer's\r\nsword which I had brought out--why I really forget now, for it was\r\nanything but sharp, which I now regret, as it would have been interesting\r\nto see the effect of a really sharp sword on a bear's back. The bull\r\nterrier now rejoined me, and, in company with two additional natives who\r\nhad run after us, I got on a piece of rock about three feet high. The man\r\nwith the sword stood on my right, and the two natives--who were\r\nunarmed--on my left, and in this order we awaited the arrival of the bear.\r\nSore and angry, he presently emerged from the jungle at a distance of\r\nabout twenty-five or thirty yards further down the slope of the hill. I\r\nfired at and hit him, and he then turned round, took a look at us, and\r\ncharged. As he came on I fired my remaining shot. Then the man with the\r\nsword struck the bear a tremendous blow on the back (which I think would\r\nhave stopped the bear had the sword been sharp), and in a second more old\r\nBruin had thrown the whole of us off the rock on to the ground behind it.\r\nThere we were then--four men, a wounded bear, and a bull terrier, all\r\nmixed up together. However, the man with the sword laid about him most\r\nmanfully, and the bear, either not liking the situation, or being\r\nexhausted with his wounds and efforts (more likely the latter), retreated\r\ninto the ravine out of which he had emerged. Into this we presently\r\nfollowed him, and after another shot or two he expired, and I have the\r\nskin at homo with the mark of the sword-cut on the back. It had cut\r\nthrough the shaggy hair, and only penetrated the skin sufficiently to\r\nleave a scar. The man who had shown so much pluck was a young farmer from\r\nthe adjacent village, and I at once offered him the sword with which he\r\nhad defended me. But he seemed to think he had done nothing, and\r\npositively declined it, saying that his neighbours would be jealous of his\r\nhaving such a fine-looking thing. I had, however, a knife made after the\r\nnative fashion, and afterwards gave it to him in commemoration of the\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nIn Mysore there are two kinds of panthers. One, the largest of the two, is\r\ncalled by the natives the Male Kiraba, or forest panther, and confines\r\nitself generally to the forest regions, while the smaller kind haunts the\r\nneighbourhood of villages. The black panther, which is of rare occurrence,\r\nis merely an offshoot of the other varieties. The panther, in consequence\r\nof its tree-climbing habits, and general aptitude for suddenly\r\ndisappearing, is of all animals the most disappointing to the sportsman,\r\nso much so, indeed, that I soon gave up going out after them. Though it\r\nhas great strength, and from the amazing suddenness of its movements,\r\ngreat means at its disposal for making successful attacks on man, it\r\nseems, unlike the tiger, bear, and wild boar, to have no confidence in its\r\nown powers, and though in one sense showing great daring by attacking dogs\r\neven when they are in the house and quite close to people, is, when\r\nattacked itself, of all animals the most cowardly--a fact which the\r\nnatives are well aware of, and which is proved by the small number of\r\npeople killed by panthers in proportion to the number of them accounted\r\nfor. The only way of insuring success when hunting panthers is to have a\r\nsmall pack of country-bred dogs of so little value that when one or two of\r\nthem may chance to be killed by the panther the matter is of little or no\r\nconsequence. The pack will soon find the panther, and perhaps run him up a\r\ntree, and thus give the sportsman a good, or rather certain chance of\r\nkilling the animal. In this way a manager of mine was very successful in\r\nbagging panthers. I have some reason to suppose that the panther, when\r\nseverely wounded, sometimes feigns death, and give the following incident\r\nwith the view of eliciting further information on the subject.\r\n\r\nTwo natives in my neighbourhood once sat up over a kill, and apparently\r\nkilled a panther--at least it lay as if dead. They then with the aid of\r\nsome villagers, who afterwards arrived on the scene of action, began to\r\nskin the panther, and the man who had wounded it took hold of the tail to\r\nstretch the body out when the panther came suddenly to life, and bit the\r\nman in the leg. One of the people present then fired at the panther,\r\napparently killing it outright. The man, who had been only slightly\r\nbitten, then again took the animal by the tail, a proceeding which it\r\nevidently could not stand, for this time it came to life in earnest, and\r\ninflicted a number of wounds on the man at the tail. The natives then\r\nattacked it with their hacking knives, and finally put an end to it. The\r\ndresser of my estate was sent to the village, which was about six miles\r\naway, to treat the wounds, but the unfortunate man died. I may add that\r\nthis is the only instance I have known of a man being killed by a panther\r\nin my neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nI now turn to an animal which is really dangerous, and I think more daring\r\nthan any animal in the jungles--the wild boar--and whatever doubts the\r\npanther has of its own powers, I feel sure that the boar can have none--in\r\nfact its action is not only daring, but at times even insulting. To be\r\nthreatened and attacked in the jungle one can understand, but to be\r\ngrowled at and menaced while on one's own premises is intolerable. I never\r\nbut once heard the deep threatening don't-come-near-me growl of the wild\r\nboar (and in the many sporting books I have read I never met with any\r\nallusion to it), and that was some years ago, within about ten or fifteen\r\nyards of my bungalow, and the incident is worth mentioning as showing the\r\ngreat daring and coolness of the wild boar.\r\n\r\nOne evening at about seven o'clock, and on a clear but moonless night, I\r\nwent into the garden in front of my house. This is flanked by a low\r\nretaining wall some three or four feet high--a wall built to retain the\r\nsoil when the ground was levelled--and below this a few bushes and plants\r\nhad sprung up close to the bottom of the wall. In these I heard what I\r\nsupposed to be a pariah dog gnawing a bone, and, in order to frighten it\r\naway, I quietly approached within a few yards of the spot, and made a\r\nslight noise between my lips. I was at once answered by a low deep growl,\r\nwhich I at first took to be the growl of a panther, and I then walked back\r\nto the bungalow and told my manager to bring a gun, telling him that there\r\nwas either a large dog (which on second thoughts appeared to me most\r\nprobable), or some animal gnawing a bone. We then quietly approached the\r\nspot where we could hear the gnawing going on quite plainly about five\r\nyards off. By my direction he fired into the bushes, and we then stood\r\nstill and listened, and presently heard what was evidently some heavy\r\nanimal walk slowly away. On the following morning I sent my most\r\nexperienced shikari to the spot, and he reported that the animal was a\r\nwild boar, which had been munching the root of some plant, and the soil\r\nbeing gravelly, the noise we had heard proceeded from the chewing of roots\r\nand gravel together. This boar then had not only refused to desist from\r\nhis proceedings when I was within five yards of him, but had even warned\r\nme, by the low growl afore mentioned, that if I came any nearer serious\r\nconsequences might ensue. On the following day I assembled some natives\r\nand beat a narrow jungly ravine below my house, at a distance of about,\r\nfifty yards from it, and there came out, not the boar, but his wife with a\r\nfamily of five or six small pigs. She was shot by a native, and the young\r\nones got away, but the boar either was not there, or, more probably, was\r\ntoo knowing to come out. He did not, however, neglect his family, but in\r\nsome way best known to himself, collected them together, and went about\r\nwith them, as, a day or two afterwards, he was seen with the young pigs by\r\nmy manager, and their tracks were also to be seen on one of the paths in\r\nmy compound, or the small inclosed park near my bungalow. This boar\r\nafterwards became very troublesome, ploughed up the beds in my rose garden\r\nat the foot of my veranda stops, and even injured a tree in the compound\r\nby tearing off the bark with his formidable tusks. But, daring though he\r\nwas, he was once accidentally put to flight by a slash of an English\r\nhunting whip. The boar, it appears, was making his round one night when my\r\nmanager, hearing something moving outside his bath-room, and imagining it\r\nto be a straying donkey--we keep some donkeys on the estate--rushed out\r\nwith his hunting-whip, and made a tremendous slash at the animal, which\r\nturned out to be the boar, so startling him by this unexpected form of\r\nattack, that he charged up a steep bank near the house and disappeared.\r\nThis boar was afterwards shot by one of my people in an adjacent\r\njungle--at least a boar was shot, which we infer must have been the one in\r\nquestion, as since then my garden has not been disturbed. The boar is more\r\ndangerous to man than any animal in our jungles, and I have heard of three\r\nor four deaths caused by them in recent years in my district. The natives,\r\nhowever, say that, till he is wounded, the tiger is less dangerous than\r\nthe boar, but that after a tiger is wounded, he is the more dangerous of\r\nthe two; and I think that this is a correct view of the matter. The boar\r\nhas a most remarkable power of starting at once into full speed, and that\r\nis why his attacks are so dangerous. In countries inhabited by wild boars\r\nit is very important to be always on the alert. As an illustration of\r\nthis, and also of the great power of the boar, and of his sometimes\r\nattacking people without any provocation on their part, I may mention the\r\nfollowing incident.\r\n\r\nWhen I was walking round part of my plantation one morning with my\r\nmanager, and we chanced to stand in a path for a few moments (I forget now\r\nfor what reason), my dogs went down the hill into the coffee, and appear\r\nthere to have disturbed a boar. Luckily for myself, I always keep a sharp\r\nlook out, and my eye caught a glimpse of something black coming up amongst\r\nthe coffee. In a single second a boar appeared in the path some twenty\r\nyards away. The path sloped downwards towards me, and at me he came, like\r\nan arrow from a bow. As there was no use in my attempting to arrest the\r\nprogress of an animal of this kind, I stepped aside and let him into my\r\nmanager, who, luckily for himself, was standing behind a broken off coffee\r\ntree, which stood at a sharp turn in the path some yards further on. The\r\nresult was very remarkable. The boar's chest struck against the coffee\r\ntree and slightly bent it on one side. This threw the boar upwards, and,\r\nof course, broke the force of the charge, but there was still enough force\r\nleft to toss my manager into an adjacent shallow pit with such violence\r\nthat his ear was filled with earth. I was now seriously alarmed, as I had\r\nno weapon of any kind, but luckily the boar went on. His tusk, it\r\nappeared, had caught the manager--a man of about six feet, and thirteen\r\nstone in weight--under the armpit, but had merely torn his coat. We\r\norganized a beat the same afternoon, and killed the boar, which was\r\nsuffering from an old wound, and this no doubt accounted, in some degree,\r\nfor his sudden and gratuitous attack. Tigers often attack the wild boar,\r\nand there are often desperate battles between them, and well authenticated\r\ninstances have been known of the boar killing the tiger. I have never met\r\nwith one in my neighbourhood, though I once aided in killing a tiger which\r\nhad been ripped in several places by a boar. As it is impossible in\r\njungly districts to ride the wild boar, he is invariably shot, except\r\nwhen, in the monsoon rains, he is occasionally speared. At that season the\r\nwild pigs make houses, or rather shelters, for themselves by cutting with\r\ntheir teeth and bending over some of the underwood, and under these they\r\nrepose. When such shelters are discovered, a man approaches them\r\ncautiously and drives his spear through the shelter into the boar's back.\r\nI have never seen this done, but have often heard of its being done where\r\nI lived in former days, during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nBoar's head pickled in vinegar and garnished with onions makes a good\r\ndish, especially after harvest, when the pigs are in good condition, but,\r\nfrom what I have known of the habits of the wild boar, I do not think I\r\nshould ever be inclined to partake of it again, and certainly not when\r\ncholera is about. A neighbour of mine told me that when he was once\r\nbeating a jungle for game the natives backed out of it with great\r\npromptness, having come upon wild pigs in the act of devouring the dead\r\nbodies of some people who had died of cholera. I may mention that it was\r\ncustomary in former times, and doubtless is so still to some extent, to\r\ndeposit the bodies of cholera victims anywhere in the jungle, instead of\r\nburying them in the ordinary way. An official of the Forest Department\r\ntold me that, passing one day near the place where the carcase of an\r\nelephant lay, he had the curiosity to go and look at it. To his\r\nastonishment he found the flanks heaving as if the elephant were still\r\nalive, and while he was wondering what this could mean, two wild boars,\r\nwhich had tunnelled their way in, and were luxuriating on the contents of\r\nthe carcase, suddenly rushed out. From what I have hitherto said it seems\r\nplain that wild boar is not a safe article of food, unless, perhaps, when,\r\nit inhabits remote jungles where foul food can rarely be met with. I have\r\nnever made any measurements of wild boars, but Colonel Peyton--a\r\nfirst-rate authority--writing in the \"Kanara Gazetteer,\" says that some\r\nare to be found measuring forty inches high, and six feet long.\r\n\r\nThe jungle dog (_kuon rutilans_) is a wolfish-looking-dog of a golden\r\nbrown colour, with hair of moderate length, and a short and slightly bushy\r\ntail. It hunts in packs of seven and eight, and sometimes as many as\r\ntwenty and even thirty have been reported. In my neighbourhood I have\r\nnever actually known them to attack cattle or persons, but Colonel Peyton\r\ntells us, in the \"Kanara Gazetteer,\" that they grew very bold in the\r\n1876-77 famine, and killed great numbers of the half-starved cattle which\r\nwere driven into the Kanara forests to graze, and since then a reward of\r\n10 rupees has been paid for the destruction of each fully grown wild dog.\r\nColonel Peyton alludes to the native idea that these dogs attack and kill\r\ntigers, but says that no instance of their having killed a tiger is known.\r\nAt the same time it is, he says, a fact that the tiger will give up his\r\nkill to wild dogs, and will leave a place in which they are present in\r\nlarge numbers. Some years ago I beat a jungle in which a tiger had killed\r\na bullock, and in which another tiger had on a former occasion lain up,\r\nbut the tiger was not there, and a number of jungle dogs were beaten out.\r\nWe afterwards found the tiger in a jungle about a mile away, and he had\r\nevidently abandoned his kill, for no other reason, apparently, than\r\nbecause of the presence of the dogs. An old Indian sportsman tells me of a\r\nvery widespread native tradition as to the action of these dogs previous\r\nto attacking a tiger. Their belief is that the dogs first of all micturate\r\non each others' bushy tails, and, when rushing past the tiger, whisk their\r\ntails into his eyes and thus blind him with, the objectionable fluid,\r\nafter which they can attack him with comparative impunity. A forest\r\nofficer informs me that the Gonds have a somewhat similar tradition, and\r\nthat they believe that the dogs first of all micturate on the ground\r\naround the tiger, and that the effluvium has the effect of blinding\r\nhim.[23] The late Mr. Sanderson, in his \"Thirteen Years amongst the Wild\r\nBeasts of India,\" mentions an instance reported to him by the natives of\r\ntheir finding a tiger sitting up with his back to a bamboo bush, so that\r\nnothing could pass behind him, while the wild dogs were walking up and\r\ndown and passing quite close to him, evidently with the view of annoying\r\nthe tiger, and the position then taken up by the tiger seemed to show that\r\nhe was apprehensive of an attack. From his experience of the great power\r\nof the wild dog, Mr. Sanderson entertained no doubt that they could kill a\r\ntiger, though he knows of no instance of their having done so. The old\r\nIndian sportsman above alluded to told me of a case where a tiger had been\r\nmarked down by native shikaris, and where they afterwards found wild dogs\r\neating the carcase of the tiger, which they had presumably killed, but I\r\ncannot find any account of the dogs having been seen in the act of killing\r\na tiger, though I can easily conceive that a hungry tiger, and an equally\r\nhungry pack of wild dogs may have come into collision over a newly killed\r\nanimal, and that the dogs may then in desperation have killed the tiger.\r\n\r\nA Coorg planter who has had opportunities of observing the habits of those\r\ndogs, tells me that when hunting a deer they do not run in a body, but\r\nspread out rather widely, so as to catch the deer on the turn if it moved\r\nto right or left. Some of the dogs hang behind to rest themselves, so as\r\nto take up the running when other dogs, which have pressed the deer hard,\r\nget tired. He once had a bitch the product of a cross between a Pariah and\r\na jungle dog. When she had pups she concealed them in the jungle, and in\r\norder to find them she had to be carefully watched and followed up. She\r\nwent through many manoeuvres to prevent the discovery of her pups, and\r\npottered about in the neighbourhood of the spot where she had concealed\r\nthem, as if bent on nothing in particular. Then she made a sudden rush\r\ninto the jungle and disappeared. After much search her pups were found in\r\na hole about three feet deep, which she had dug on the side of a rising\r\npiece of ground. The bitch did not bark--the jungle dog does not--and the\r\npups barked but slightly, but the next generation barked as domestic dogs\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nMany years ago I met with a very singular and puzzling circumstance in\r\nconnection with jungle dogs. I had offered a reward of five rupees for a\r\npup, and one day several natives from a village some three or four miles\r\naway, brought me a pup--apparently about six or eight months old. This, it\r\nappears, they had caught by placing some nets near the carcase of a tiger\r\nI had killed, and on which a pack of these dogs was feeding. They drove\r\nthe dogs towards the nets, which they jumped, but the pup in question was\r\ncaught in the net. My cook now appeared on the scene and declared that the\r\npup belonged to him, and that he had brought it from Bangalore, and on\r\nhearing this I declined, of course, to pay the reward. As I had never, and\r\nhave never, seen a jungle dog pup, I neither could then, nor can now,\r\nundertake to say whether the pup was a wild one or not, though it seemed\r\nto me that it might have been a kind of mongrel animal with a good deal of\r\nthe pariah dog in it. The natives then requested the cook to take the pup\r\nand pay them five rupees for their trouble. This he declined to do, and\r\nthey then said they would take it back to the carcase of the tiger and let\r\nit go. This they did, and the pup was never heard of again, and I assume\r\nthat it must have rejoined the wild dogs. As my cook had no conceivable\r\nmotive for falsely asserting that the dog was his, I can only assume that\r\nthe animal had strayed away and joined the pack of wild dogs.\r\n\r\nThere is no reward for killing wild dogs in Mysore, as is the case in the\r\nMadras Presidency, and I should strongly advise that one should be given,\r\nas from the great destruction of the game, on which they at present live,\r\nthese animals will soon become very destructive to cattle, and possibly,\r\nor even probably, dangerous to man. And it is the more important to attend\r\nto this matter at once, because I find, from Jerdon's \"Mammals of India,\"\r\nthat the bitch has at least six whelps at a birth, and he mentions that\r\nMr. Elliot (the late Sir Walter) remarks that the wild dog was not known\r\nin the Southern Maharatta country until of late years, but that it was now\r\nvery common; and he adds that he once captured a bitch and seven cubs, and\r\nhad them alive for some time. No one has any interest in killing these\r\njungle dogs, and until a reward is offered for their destruction, they\r\nwill go on increasing at an alarming rate.\r\n\r\nI now pass on to offer some remarks on snakes, and especially on the great\r\nnumber of deaths said to be caused by them, and I say said to be caused by\r\nthem, because I have good reason to suppose that the immense number of\r\ndeaths (sometimes returned at 17,000 or 18,000 for all India) reported as\r\nbeing caused by them, are really poisoning cases which are falsely\r\nreturned as being due to snake bite. When mentioning this surmise on\r\nboard of a P. and O. ship to two civilians, they demurred to the idea, and\r\nI then asked them if they had ever known within their own cognizance of a\r\nman being killed by a snake--i.e., either seen a man fatally bitten, or\r\nwho had been fatally bitten. They never had, and that too during a service\r\nof about twenty-four years. I then, out of curiosity, made inquiries\r\nthrough all the first-class passengers, and at last met with one lady who\r\nhad a gardener who had been killed by a snake. I also got my English\r\nservant to make a similar inquiry in the second-class, and no passenger\r\nthere had known of a case, though one of them had been engaged in\r\nsurveying operations for ten years. My attention has been particularly\r\ncalled to this subject in consequence of my own long experience, which\r\nstretches back to the year 1855, and, though cobras have been killed in\r\nand around my house, and in the plantations, I have not only never known\r\nof a death from snake bite on my estates, but have, since the date\r\nmentioned, never heard of but one case in my neighbourhood, and that was\r\nof a boy who was killed by some deadly snake about four or five miles from\r\nmy house. I made inquiries in Bangalore on this subject. Now Bangalore is\r\na place which always had a bad reputation as regards cobras. The\r\npopulation is large, and there are, of course, numerous gardens, and many\r\ngrass cutters are employed, and the occupations there of a large number of\r\npeople are such as to make them liable to risk from snake bite; and yet,\r\nin the course of the year, there had only been, three cases of snake bite.\r\nHow is it then that such an infinitesimal number of the cases reported on\r\noccur within the cognizance of Europeans? And unless some competent\r\nobserver is at hand to determine the cause of death, what can be easier\r\nthan to poison a man, puncture his skin, and then point to the puncture as\r\nan evidence that the death was caused by snake bite?\r\n\r\nOf one thing I feel certain, and that is, that the cobra is a timid snake,\r\nthat it is not at all inclined to bite, and unless assailed and so\r\ninfuriated, will not bite, even if trodden on by accident, as long as the\r\nsnake is not hurt, which, of course, it would not be if trodden upon by\r\nthe bare foot, and that is why, I feel sure, I have so rarely heard of a\r\nman being bitten by a snake during my long experience in India. I can give\r\na remarkable confirmatory instance, which happened at my bungalow some\r\nyears ago. My English servant had got his feet wet one morning, and had\r\nplaced his shoes to dry on a ledge of the bungalow just above the place\r\nwhere the bath-room water runs out. At about three in the afternoon he\r\nwent in his slippers round the end of the bungalow to get his shoes, and\r\ntrod on a cobra which was lying in the soft and rather muddy ground\r\ncreated by the bath-room water. He had stepped on to about the middle of\r\nthe snake's body, but probably rather nearer the tail than the head. The\r\ncobra then reared up its body, spread its hood, hissed, and struggled to\r\nget free, while my servant held up his hands to avoid the chance of being\r\nbitten, and he said that he could see that the afternoon sun was\r\nilluminating the interior of its throat, but he was afraid to let it go,\r\nthinking that it would then be more able to bite him. This, however, he is\r\nquite positive it never attempted to do, and after some moments of\r\nhesitation he jumped to one side, and the snake, so far from offering to\r\nbite when liberated, went off in the opposite direction with all speed. I\r\nam sure that wild animals perceive quite as readily as tame ones do the\r\ndifference between what is purely accidental, and what results from malice\r\nprepense. The snake must have perceived that its being trodden upon was a\r\npure accident, and, as it was not hurt, did not bite. A Brahmin once told\r\nme of a somewhat similar case, where his mother, seeing what she supposed\r\nwas a kitten in a passage of the house, gave it a push on one side with\r\nher foot. It turned out to be a cobra, which spread its hood and hissed,\r\nbut never offered to bite her. Colonel Barras, the author of some charming\r\nnatural history books, told me that he quite agrees that the cobra is\r\ndisinclined to bite, and pave me a practical illustration of this which\r\nhad fallen within his own observation. On one occasion, when some of my\r\ncoolies were crossing a log, which was lying on the ground, my overseer,\r\njust as they were doing so, observed that under a bent-up portion of the\r\nlog there was a cobra. He waited till all the coolies had crossed over and\r\nmoved on, and then stirred up the cobra and killed it. I mention these\r\ninstances to show that it is probably owing to the fact of the cobra not\r\nbeing at all an aggressive snake, and not being given to bite unless\r\nattacked, or hurt, that no death has occurred on my estates, or in my\r\nneighbourhood during such a long period of time.\r\n\r\nBut there is probably another reason, which has not, that I am aware of,\r\nbeen taken into account by previous writers, and that is that snakes keep\r\na much better look out, and perceive the approach of people from a much\r\ngreater distance than is usually supposed. I was much struck with this\r\nfact on two occasions this year. In one case I was walking along a foot\r\nroad in my compound, and on going round a bend of the road saw, about\r\nthirty yards away, a snake in the road with its body half raised, and\r\nevidently in an on-the-look-out attitude, and the moment it perceived me\r\nit lowered its body and went off through the long grass. In the other case\r\nI saw a snake on bare ground upwards of 100 yards away which had evidently\r\nseen me, for it made off in the way which a disturbed snake always does. I\r\nwas this year surprised to hear tigers and snakes classed together as to\r\nrunning away by a toddy-drawer--a class of people who are often out in the\r\njungle at dusk, and sometimes later. I had made a new four feet trace of\r\nabout a mile long along a beautiful ridge which connects my estate with an\r\noutlying piece of the property, and unfortunately mentioned to my wife\r\nthat at the end of the path tigers crossed over occasionally (it was a\r\ntiger pass as the natives call it), and she objected to go there late in\r\nthe evening. Being desirous of going to the end of the path one evening, I\r\ncalled to a toddyman in my employ and told him to accompany us, telling my\r\nwife that he was a timid creature and not likely to incur any risk he\r\ncould avoid. I mentioned to him the apprehension of the lady, when he\r\nsaid, \"Tigers and snakes run away,\" and he seemed to have no apprehension\r\nas regards either of them, though part of the land in which he cut toddy\r\ntrees was on the tiger pass. And I may mention that I this year wounded a\r\ntiger within fifty yards of the pass, and on the following morning saw the\r\ntracks of a tiger and tigress (the track of the latter is easily to be\r\ndistinguished as it is longer and narrower than that of the male) in the\r\njungle adjoining the end of the foot road alluded to.\r\n\r\nAs many Europeans kill all snakes they meet with, it is well to mention\r\nthat the tank snake--a large snake often from nine to ten feet long--is\r\nnot only harmless but useful, as it lives so largely on rats and mice, and\r\nis in consequence sometimes called the rat snake. On one occasion a\r\nmanager shot one of these snakes near my house, and it had a rat in its\r\nmouth when killed, and such snakes, so far from being killed, ought to be\r\ncarefully protected. I was this year rather interested in observing the\r\nproceedings of one of these snakes when followed up by two dogs of mine in\r\nthe open. First of all, it made for a clump of two or three scrubby trees,\r\nand, apparently first fastening itself by the neck to a stump, lashed out\r\nwith its tail. Then when the dogs came closer it again made off through\r\nthe grass, but on being overtaken by the dogs must have either bitten one\r\nof them, or lashed it with its tail, as the dog gave a sharp cry and\r\nretreated. On a previous occasion one of these snakes bit a dog of mine,\r\nand it was not in the slightest degree affected. These snakes travel at a\r\nfair pace, and I found by trotting along parallel to one that it can move\r\nat the rate of the moderate jog trot of a horse, and apparently keep up\r\nthis pace with ease. But, though it would be easy for me to write more\r\nabout snakes, the reader has probably heard enough of them, and I hope has\r\nlearnt some facts of practical importance by the way, and I shall now\r\noffer a few remarks on jungle pets.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly supposed that wild animals naturally or instinctively dread\r\nman, but it seems to me that, though no doubt a certain degree of dread of\r\nman may have been, after having been acquired by experience, transmitted\r\nto the offspring, wild animals require to be taught to dread man by their\r\nparents, for we find that if animals are caught when very young and are\r\nnot confined in any way, they not only do not dread man, but eventually\r\nprefer his society to that of their own species.\r\n\r\nThe first instance I have to notice of this is in the case of a spotted\r\ndeer stag which belonged to a neighbour of mine. This animal, which had\r\nbeen caught when a fawn, used to accompany the coolies in the morning and\r\nremained with them all day, but in the evening it went into the jungle\r\nregularly and disappeared for the night, and again turned up at the\r\nmorning muster with unfailing regularity. It thus roamed the jungle all\r\nnight, and remained with man all day. At last it became dangerous to man,\r\nas tame stags often do, and had to be shot.\r\n\r\nAnother still more extraordinary instance was in the case of a pet of my\r\nown--what the natives call a flying cat, but in reality a flying squirrel\r\n(_Pteromys petaurista_)--an animal that sleeps all day and feeds at night\r\n(though on one occasion, mentioned in a previous chapter, I saw one\r\nfeeding on fruit at about seven one morning), and is in habits somewhat\r\nlike the bat, though clearly of the squirrel order. Its wings, if indeed\r\nthey may be called such, consist merely of a flap of skin stretching from\r\nthe fore to the hind legs. When at rest this flap, as it folds into the\r\nside, is not very noticeable, and the animal presents, when on the ground,\r\nor on the branch of a tree, the appearance of a very large, grey furred\r\nsquirrel. It cannot, of course, rise from the ground, but, when travelling\r\nfrom tree to tree, it spreads its flap, or perhaps rather sets its sail,\r\nby the agency of osseous appendages attached to the feet, but which fold\r\nup against the leg when the animal is at rest, and starts like a man on\r\nthe trapeze--descending from one point to rise again to about a similar\r\nlevel on the next tree, but when the flight is extended (Jerdon, in his\r\n\"Mammals of India,\" says he has seen one traverse in the air a distance of\r\nsixty yards) the squirrel reaches the tree very low down. When clearing\r\nthe forest these squirrels often emerged from their holes in the trees and\r\ngave me good opportunities of observing their movements, and I feel sure\r\nthat I have seen them traverse distances of at least 100 yards. One of\r\nthese squirrels was brought to me when it was about half grown, and came\r\nto consider my house as its natural home. It soon discovered a suitable\r\nretreat for the day in the shape of an empty clothes-bag hanging at the\r\nback of a door, and in this it slept all day. It came out at dusk, and\r\nused often to sit on the back of my high backed chair as I sat at dinner,\r\nand then I gave it fruit and bread. After dinner away it went to the\r\njungle, and I seldom saw anything more of it till very early in the\r\nmorning, when it used to enter the house by an open swing window, get on\r\nto my bed, and curl itself up at my feet. When I rose my pet did so too\r\nand betook itself to the clothes-bag, and there spent the day, to go\r\nthrough the same round the following night. This very pretty and\r\ninteresting animal met with the common fate of defenceless pets, and was\r\nkilled by a dog as it was making its way to the jungle one evening.\r\n\r\nA third instance I may give as regards the way in which wild animals\r\nreadily become domesticated, and eventually seem to prefer the society of\r\nman to that of their own species. In this case my pet was a hornbill, a\r\nbird of discordant note, and with a huge beak, and a box-like crowned\r\nhead. This creature was also totally unrestrained, but showed a most\r\ndecided preference for the society of man. One day it joined some of its\r\nspecies which made their appearance in the jungle near my house, but soon\r\ngot tired of or disgusted with them, and speedily returned to the\r\nbungalow. It used to swallow its food like a man taking a pill, and it was\r\nsurprising to observe the ease with which balls of rice of about the size\r\nof two large walnuts were dispatched. On one occasion it flew off with my\r\nbunch of keys, but was luckily seen by my servant, who gave the alarm. The\r\nbird threw back its head the moment it alighted on the first convenient\r\nbranch, and it was only from the ring sticking in the front of its beak\r\nthat it was prevented from swallowing the entire bunch. Finding my people\r\nclose upon it, the bird flew away to a piece of forest some hundreds of\r\nyards away, where it seemed to take a most aggravating pleasure in\r\ndangling my keys from the tops of the loftiest trees, and it was some time\r\nbefore it let them drop, which I conclude it at last did merely because it\r\ncould not swallow them.\r\n\r\nNow, though none of the pets I have mentioned were made miserable by\r\nrestraint, and evidently must have found themselves perfectly happy in the\r\nsociety of man, it is very remarkable that, though all of them must have\r\nhad (and the bird certainly had) frequent opportunities of making the\r\nacquaintance of their species as they roamed the jungle at night, they\r\nregularly returned to the society of man. I can only conjecture that the\r\nforce of habit must have, as it were, chained them to the place they had\r\nbecome accustomed to. It is difficult to guess at any other reason than\r\nthe force of habit, but it is just possible that the following fact may\r\nhave something to do with their neglect of their own species. It is well\r\nknown that a great many animals and birds refuse to, or cannot, propagate\r\ntheir kind when in a state of confinement. Now these pets of mine, and the\r\nstag which belonged to my neighbour, were not indeed confined in any\r\nsense, but it is just possible that the altered conditions under which\r\nthey lived may have acted on their animal desires, and so have rendered\r\nthem indifferent to the society of their species. Or perhaps it is\r\nconceivable that, in consequence of their living in or about an inhabited\r\ndwelling, they may have contracted bodily impurities which may have been\r\nperceptible to their wild congeners.\r\n\r\nI had here intended to close this chapter, but a few lines more must be\r\ndevoted to guns, or rather to a gun, for the general opinion in India now\r\nseems to be that only one gun is necessary for shooting shot and ball--at\r\nleast for all shot shooting and ball shooting in the jungly countries.\r\nThat gun is the widely-known Paradox, which, up to 100 yards, is as\r\naccurate as a double rifle, and even at 150 yards makes very fair\r\npractice. This gun was a good many years ago recommended to me by Sir\r\nSamuel Baker, and I found it to be such an excellent weapon that I now use\r\nno other. The great advantage of the Paradox is that the gun is a good\r\nshot gun, and gives a pattern quite equal to the best of cylinder guns,\r\nand of course comes up to the shoulder so readily that the sportsman can\r\ntake snap shots as well as with any other fowling-piece. The immense\r\nadvantage of this in a jungly country, and in one with long grass, must be\r\nreadily apparent to anyone accustomed to shoot in such regions, where you\r\noften require to be able to fire as sharply as you do at a snipe rising\r\njust within range.\r\n\r\nI am informed by Messrs. Holland and Holland, of 98, New Bond Street (the\r\nmakers of the Paradox guns), that the Paradox system of ball and shot guns\r\nwas the invention of Colonel Fosbery, V.C. Originally it was intended for\r\nthe ordinary 12-bore guns, but its principle has now been applied to\r\nsmaller weapons, such as those of 20 bore, and also to heavy guns of 8 or\r\n10 bore for attacking elephants, bison, and other very large game. Guns of\r\nthe two last-named bores are from two to three pounds lighter than rifles\r\nof similar bores, and the increased handiness caused by the diminution of\r\nweight is of course of immense advantage. Messrs. Holland and Holland\r\ninform me that they have made many experiments with the 8-bore Paradox\r\nagainst the 8-bore rifle, and in every case have obtained higher velocity\r\nand greater penetration with the Paradox. The new 10-bore is almost a 9,\r\nand practically is big enough for any game. It shoots 8 drams of powder,\r\nand a fairly long conical bullet, and its weight is about 12-1/2 lbs.\r\nMessrs. Holland and Holland have invented a new steel bullet for these\r\nguns, and with this the penetration is very great. The 20 and 16-bore\r\nParadox guns weigh from 6-1/2 lbs. to 7 lbs., and are largely used on the\r\nContinent for shooting wild boar, bears, and other large game. Nearly all\r\nthese guns are made with hammers, because as a rule sportsmen travelling\r\nin wild countries prefer to have the old-fashioned hammer guns, which are\r\nso universally understood, instead of a hammerless gun, which cannot be so\r\neasily repaired should it break down in any part. Messrs. Holland and\r\nHolland inform me that for the ordinary 12-bore Paradox weighing 7 lbs.\r\nthe usual charge of 3 drams is all that is necessary for soft-skinned\r\nanimals such as tigers, leopards, and bears, but they also make a heavier\r\n12-bore, weighing from 8 lbs. to 8-1/2 lbs., and shooting 4 or 4-1/2\r\ndrams of powder, but generally recommend the usual 7 lbs. Paradox, and,\r\nfrom my experience of the latter with tigers, I do not think one could\r\ndesire a better gun for all jungle shooting, though I need hardly add that\r\nfor antelope shooting on the plains a long range rifle is desirable.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] \"Jungle Life in India, or the Journeys and Journals of an Indian\r\nGeologist,\" by V. Ball, M.A. London, Thos. De La Rue and Co., 1880.\r\n\r\n[22] \"My Indian Journal,\" by Colonel Walter Campbell. Edinburgh, Edmonston\r\nand Douglas, 1864.\r\n\r\n[23] In Jerdon's \"Mammals of India\" it is stated that in Nepaul the wild\r\ndogs, whose urine is said to be peculiarly acrid, sprinkle it over bushes\r\nthrough which an animal will probably move with the view of blinding their\r\nvictim. Jerdon certainly disbelieves the native story of their capturing\r\ntheir prey through the acridity of their urine. It seems to me not\r\nimprobable that the wild dogs may have become aware of the offensive\r\ncharacter of their urine, and in passing near a tiger might discharge some\r\nof it with the view of annoying the tiger and driving him away, and also\r\nperhaps as a mark of contempt, and that this probably was the origin of\r\nthe widely spread story I have alluded to in the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN BISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough at the risk of being thought sentimental, I cannot say that I\r\napproach the subject of bison shooting with much satisfaction, except,\r\nperhaps, in the thought that what I am about to write may be the means of\r\nprolonging in some degree, however infinitesimal, the existence of the\r\nrace of these splendid animals, for I am afraid that nothing that anyone\r\ncould write would prevent their numbers from being steadily diminished,\r\nand diminished, too, in some cases even by people who call themselves\r\nsportsmen; for one rather well-known writer has not only killed cow\r\nbisons, but actually published the fact--a thing that he certainly would\r\nnot have done had the custom of shooting them not been common in some\r\nparts of India. I am happy to say that I never saw a dead cow bison, and\r\nin my part of Mysore, in the course of upwards of thirty-seven years'\r\nexperience, I have never heard of more than two or three cows having been\r\nkilled. Anything more foolish and barbarous than the killing of cow bisons\r\ncannot be conceived, for there is not a more harmless and inoffensive\r\nanimal in the jungle than the bison--harmless because it seldom\r\nattacks[24] crops (I have never known of more than one instance of their\r\ndoing so), and inoffensive because, if not molested, it never attacks man;\r\nand Mr. Sanderson, in his admirable work entitled \"Thirteen Years amongst\r\nthe Wild Beasts of India,\" declares that even solitary bulls, which are\r\nsupposed to be dangerous, even if not molested, are not really so, though\r\nin the event of a native coming suddenly on a bull in the long grass, he\r\nadmits the bison may spring suddenly up and dash at the intruder to clear\r\nhim from his path. He has a most sympathetic chapter on these noble\r\nanimals, and has enjoyed from an elephant's back the best opportunities of\r\nobserving them, as the bison does not fear the elephant, in whose company\r\nindeed it is often found to be, and after having thus observed a herd of\r\nbison grazing, he says that he has \"often left the poor animals\r\nundisturbed.\" Laterly he never thought of attacking herd bison, as it is\r\noften difficult to get a shot at the bull of the herd, and confined his\r\nshooting to those old solitary bulls which have been turned out of the\r\nherds by younger and more vigorous animals. These ought alone, indeed, to\r\nbe the object of pursuit, and it is one usually carried on under such\r\ncircumstances and amidst such splendid scenes that the sport is very\r\nattractive, and the pursuit of the solitary bull, writes Mr. Sanderson,\r\ncan never, he imagines, pall on the most successful hunter. Perhaps this\r\nis true, but after having killed, say six solitary bulls, I think that a\r\nsportsman ought to be content for the rest of his life. A young forest\r\nofficer lately told me that, having killed about that number, he had\r\nannounced to his friends his intention of not killing any more. Shortly\r\nafterwards he fell in with two bulls who were engaged in a fierce battle\r\nwith each other, and he might easily have shot one or perhaps both of\r\nthem, but he had strength of mind to resist the temptation, a fact which,\r\nif known, would certainly entitle him to advancement in the service.\r\n\r\nI have said that the bison, unless molested, will never attack man, and I\r\nwas so confident of this that I once sent a highly valued European in my\r\nemploy, to photograph a solitary bull, merely sending with him a native\r\nwith a gun, and with instructions to fire in the event of the photographer\r\nbeing attacked. I selected a small piece of open swampy grass ground in a\r\ndetached piece of jungle through which solitary bulls often passed, and\r\nknowing the direction of the wind at that season of the year, had no\r\ndifficulty in avoiding any chance of the bull winding the photographer.\r\nThe camera was placed on the edge of the jungle, and presently a bull came\r\nslowly grazing along the swamp, when he unluckily looked up to find the\r\nphotographer just taking the cap off, within about ten paces. Never was\r\nthere anything more annoying, and the thing would have been a magnificent\r\nsuccess had my man been provided with the instantaneous process. But he\r\nwas not, and the bull turned and fled through the mud with a most\r\ntremendous rush, having, I suppose, taken the lens for the glare of the\r\neye of some new kind of tiger. The sudden change in the appearance of the\r\nbull was described to me as being most remarkable, for as he grazed\r\nquietly along he appeared to be one of the most harmless and domestic of\r\nanimals, while the moment the sight of the camera fell on his astonished\r\nvision he was at once transformed into the wildest looking animal\r\nconceivable.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe that big game in remote spots can perceive\r\nwhether a man means to harm them or not, but it is remarkable that when on\r\nhis way to the jungle alluded to, the photographer passed two sambur deer\r\nin the long grass, and at no great distance away, and saw them still lying\r\nthere on his return. A bear was also rolling and grunting in the jungle\r\nclose to him as he was waiting for the bull. On his return to the hut (put\r\nup for the occasion about a mile away) he was amused to find the native\r\nservant I had sent with him seated between two roasting fires which he\r\nimagined, and perhaps not without reason, would prevent his being attacked\r\nby a tiger. During the absence of my amateur photographer either a tiger\r\nor panther had passed close to the hut.\r\n\r\nThe photographer returned to the swamp on the following morning, but no\r\nbull arrived, and I gave up the attempt to obtain a photograph of a bison.\r\nBut it is time now to describe the bison.\r\n\r\nThe Indian bison (_Gavoeus Gaurus_, sometimes called the Gaur) is the\r\nlargest member in the world of the ox tribe. It is quite free from mane or\r\nshaggy hair of any kind. The cows are of a dark brown, while in mature and\r\nold bulls the colour approaches to black. The legs from the knee downwards\r\nare of a dirty white (I once saw two bison with apparently blue legs, the\r\ncolour being caused by standing on ashes, and this gave them a very\r\nremarkable appearance), and so is the forehead. The bison has no hump. It\r\nhas a marked peculiarity in the shape of the back from the dorsal ridge\r\nrunning with a slight upward slope to about the middle of the back and\r\nthen dropping suddenly towards the rump. Mr. Sanderson has never shot a\r\nbull more than six feet in height at the shoulder (if measured at the top\r\nof the dorsal ridge the height would of course be more), but Jerdon the\r\nnaturalist, quoting Elliot (the late Sir Walter, a very careful observer)\r\nmentions six feet one-and-a-half inch as the height of one. I have\r\ngenerally found that an average sized bull is six feet, but I once killed\r\none that was seven feet, and a neighbour of mine who has seen a great deal\r\nof bison shooting has killed one of similar height, and he informs me that\r\nhe is positive that he has seen a larger bull than either of these very\r\nexceptional animals.\r\n\r\nBison herds generally number about twelve or fourteen, and I have never\r\nseen one of more than twenty-three, but at certain seasons they\r\ncongregate in considerable numbers and again separate into small herds.\r\nThey lie at night in a compact circle so that if attacked by a tiger they\r\nare ready to oppose at once a good front to the enemy. They seem to be\r\nquite aware that if they were to lie scattered about a tiger might\r\nsuddenly spring upon one of them.\r\n\r\nThe bison has never been kept long in captivity, and there is only one\r\ninstance of its having been so, and that is in the case of a bull bison\r\nnow in possession of His Highness the Maharajah of Mysore. The history of\r\nthis animal, and more especially of the warm friendship that sprung up\r\nbetween it and a doe sambur deer, is extremely interesting. I took down\r\nthe following from my neighbour Mr. Park, and read over to him the account\r\nI now give.\r\n\r\nIt appears then that Mr. Park when out shooting some years ago, caught a\r\nmale calf bison which was supposed to be about three days old. About a\r\nweek afterwards a young doe sambur, which was being pursued by jungle\r\ndogs, rushed into one of the labourer's huts and was secured. It was then\r\nresolved to keep the deer as a companion for the bison, and the two were\r\nkept together, though they were never shut up. They were first of all fed\r\non milk, and then allowed to graze, and soon became quite inseparable\r\ncompanions. They were fed at twelve o'clock and at four in the afternoon,\r\nand seemed to know their feeding time exactly. When about two years old it\r\nwas resolved to fit the bison with a nose rope, and for this the nose had\r\nof course to be bored. He was tied up to a tree to be operated on and,\r\nafter the hole was bored, he was liberated, when he rushed all over the\r\nground adjacent to the house bellowing with rage--the only time, I may\r\nadd, Mr. Park ever heard him bellow. After this he was regularly led out\r\nto graze by a man who trained him, by pulling the nose rope, to go in one\r\ndirection or another. After this he was fed on gram (a kind of pea). When\r\nthus led out to graze the sambur sometimes remained behind, but seemed to\r\nhave no difficulty in finding the bull even though it had been taken to a\r\nconsiderable distance. It would hold up its nose to catch the scent and\r\nthen go off on the track. When the bison occasionally missed the doe he\r\nwould wander about in search of her, but seemed to have no power of\r\nfollowing her by scent--a power which she evidently possessed and\r\npractised. When the doe bathed in the river and splashed up the water with\r\nher fore feet the bull would stand upon the bank watching her proceedings\r\nwith evident interest and curiosity, but did not himself bathe, nor appear\r\nto have any desire to go into the water. The bison, however, seemed to\r\nenjoy the cooling effect of the heavy monsoon rains, and no doubt thought\r\nthat a shower bath of some hundreds of inches was quite enough for the\r\nrest of the year.\r\n\r\nWhen the bull was about three years old it was presented to the Maharajah\r\nof Mysore, and sent off to the nearest railway station some sixty miles\r\naway. Some time after he had left, the doe discovered his absence, and\r\nthen, in her usual way, went about holding up her nose in order to\r\ndiscover the direction in which he had gone. Presently she hit off the\r\nroute and, setting off in pursuit, overtook her old companion after he\r\ngone about five or six miles, and, though the doe had not been given to\r\nthe Maharajah, she was allowed to accompany the bull. When the doe\r\novertook the bull he showed the greatest signs of pleasure at her arrival,\r\nand the two travelled happily along to Mysore.\r\n\r\nI saw the bison at Mysore in 1891, when it looked remarkably well and\r\nhappy, though the doe was not with it at the time. I was since glad to\r\nhear from a friend, who had seen them last October, that these strange and\r\ninseparable companions are in excellent health. It was very fortunate that\r\nthe doe accompanied the bull, as I think it probable that the latter\r\nwould have pined away and died, as the bison seems hitherto always to have\r\ndone in captivity.\r\n\r\nBison are often attacked by tigers, and I once found the remains of one\r\nthat had been killed by a tiger. It had been killed on the grass land\r\nbetween two and three hundred yards from the jungle, and I was much struck\r\nby the fact that the tiger had separated the head from the body and\r\ncarried it into the forest, where I found the skull. It appeared to be\r\nthat of a fair sized bull. But the largest bulls are sometimes killed by\r\ntigers, though I imagine that this must be rare, or we should not find\r\nvery old bulls in a country where tigers are plentiful. A tiger I believe\r\nsometimes tires out a bull by inducing him to charge again and again till\r\nhe is quite worn out, and sometimes, I am informed by an experienced\r\nsportsman, two tigers will join in attacking a bison, and have been known\r\nto hamstring it. I have been told by a toddyman who lived on the edge of\r\nthe forest region, that in a valley near his house he had seen a tiger\r\nworrying a bison and inducing it to charge for nearly a whole day and\r\nultimately killing it. But sometimes the bison succeeds in driving off the\r\ntiger, which then slinks away. About two years ago an interesting\r\nillustration took place of this, which was witnessed by a neighbour of\r\nmine, who found that when stalking a bull bison he had a fellow stalker in\r\nthe shape of a tiger. The incident was at once rare and interesting--in\r\nfact, so far as I know, quite unique--and I asked my friend to write me an\r\naccount of it for publication in my book.\r\n\r\n\"When I was returning,\" writes my friend Mr. Brooke Mockett, \"one day in\r\nthe beginning of the monsoon of 1891, from visiting a plantation of mine\r\nnear the Ghauts, I deflected somewhat from my route to visit an adjacent\r\nrange of minor hills, and presently entered a shallow valley, on the\r\nopposite side of which the forest land was fringed with some scrubby\r\nbushes mingled with ferns, outside of which was a stretch of open grass\r\nland. As I entered the valley I saw on the opposite side of it a solitary\r\nbull bison grazing along towards the open grass land. This, at the rate he\r\nwas moving, he would soon reach. I therefore took up a position so as to\r\nget a shot at him when he got fairly into the open land, where he would be\r\nimmediately below and opposite to me. Two Hindoo ryots--always called\r\ngoudas in Manjarabad--from a neighbouring village were with me, and were\r\nkeeping a sharp look out. We were all quite concealed in the long grass.\r\nPresently one of them whispered, 'Look, look, there is a tiger stalking\r\nthe bison,' and, after peering into the bushes for a few seconds, I at\r\nlast made out the tiger, which was about 200 yards further along the\r\nvalley to the east of the bison, towards which it was stealthily creeping.\r\nI at once decided not to interfere at present, but to leave the animals\r\nalone and watch the result. The tiger struck me as being a small one, and\r\nthe goudas thought so too. It was probably the same one that had some\r\nweeks before killed a three-parts-grown bison, the remains of which we saw\r\nwhen on the way to the spot. The bull was a magnificent animal, and just\r\nin his prime. It was a most exciting scene; the ponderous bull grazing\r\nquietly along the valley in utter ignorance of danger, and feeding so\r\nindustriously that he never once lifted his head from the ground, while\r\nthe tiger crawled towards him in a manner that was exquisite to see. Belly\r\nto the ground, its movements resembled rather those of a snake than an\r\nanimal as it wound its way through the scrub, gliding through the ferns,\r\nand taking advantage of all the bushes. Occasionally it sat up to peer\r\ncautiously at the bull, and then sinking down it again glided on. Except\r\nnow and then, when the bushes were low, I doubt if it could see the bull,\r\nnor could the latter scent the tiger, for the bull was feeding down the\r\nvalley in the teeth of the strong monsoon winds, and the tiger was\r\nfollowing in its tracks.\r\n\r\n\"As the two goudas sitting with me in the long grass observed the\r\nmovements of the tiger, they could not contain their indignation. No doubt\r\nthey thought of the many cattle they had recently lost, and, connecting\r\nthe present revelation of the tiger's mode of proceeding with the\r\nslaughter of their buffaloes, they relieved their feelings by uttering\r\n_sotto voce_ the most virulent abuse of the tiger, its wife, and its\r\nfemale relations in general, and every fresh movement of the tiger drew\r\nfrom them some extremely powerful and untranslatable epithets. The\r\ntemptation to fire at the tiger was very great, but I refrained, as every\r\nmoment brought them nearer to me, and it seemed certain that the fight\r\nmust come off just below the ground I was seated on.\r\n\r\n\"The scene was now an extremely exciting one, for the animals were about\r\n200 yards from us, the bull having fed to within fifty yards of the open\r\ngrass, and the tiger having crept so close to him that every moment we\r\nexpected something to happen. We saw the tiger crawl right up to the bull,\r\nand it seemed to get actually within a yard of it, and yet it did not\r\nspring. A few seconds more passed, and then the bull, suddenly becoming\r\naware of the tiger's presence, made a rapid rush forward into the open\r\ngrass land outside of the scrub. Then he pulled up at a distance from it\r\nof about sixty yards, and faced round in the direction of the tiger. Had\r\nhe liked, he might have gone away altogether; but, far from showing fear,\r\nhe was furious, and looked superb as he shook his head and snorted with\r\nrage. Then for about two minutes he stood as still as if carved of stone,\r\nevidently straining all his senses to discover the tiger, after which he\r\nmade a terrific charge up to the edge of the scrub, where he pulled up and\r\nagain snorted, and shook his head. If ever a bison meant business he did,\r\nand could he have seen the tiger he would have certainly tried to kill it,\r\nbut it was hiding in the scrub and was invisible to him, though we could\r\njust make out its golden red skin.\r\n\r\n\"The sight of the infuriated bull within a few yards was altogether too\r\nmuch for the tiger, which now turned and commenced to sneak off with\r\nastonishing rapidity, keeping completely out of the bison's sight, and\r\nlooking like the most abject wretch imaginable. My goudas became frantic\r\nat this, and seeing that there was now no chance of a fight between the\r\nbull and the tiger, I rushed along the hill with the view of trying to get\r\na good shot at the latter, but this I found would be impossible, so I\r\nrested my rifle on a stamp, and, as he moved through the scrub, took a\r\nlong shot, which knocked him off his legs, and we saw him partly roll and\r\npartly scramble into the dense jungle below. A shout of 'The bull is\r\ngoing,' from the goudas, made me look back, and just as he was starting I\r\nhastily fired my second barrel into his shoulder and dropped him dead. We\r\nthen went to look for the tiger, but, most unfortunately, the rain, which\r\nup to this time had kept off, descended in torrents, and the whole country\r\nbecame enveloped in dense mist. We found the spot where the tiger had been\r\nknocked over, and the goudas soon discovered cut hair (by the bullet), a\r\nsure proof of a hit. We could see where he had rolled down, the slope to\r\nthe thick forest, crushing the ferns, and tearing up the ground with his\r\nstruggles, but the blood was of course washed away by the tropical rain\r\ntorrents. Within the forest, which was almost impenetrable, all was dark\r\nas night, and as no track could be seen, and we were soon all drenched to\r\nthe skin, it was impossible to do anything more, and I was compelled to\r\ngive up the pursuit. Why the tiger, after getting so close to the bison\r\ndid not attack, it is impossible to say, but the men who accompanied me\r\nwere of opinion that, owing to the bison being partly hidden by the\r\nscrub, the tiger could not gauge its size till quite close to it, and then\r\nwas afraid to attack such a large bull.\"\r\n\r\nI think that their surmise is correct, and as I have before suggested, I\r\nthink that these very large bulls are but rarely attacked by tigers, for\r\nmy experience shows that solitary bulls are easily stalked, to within\r\nquite close distances, and, were the tigers easily able to kill them, I\r\nfeel sure that a solitary bull would very seldom be found.\r\n\r\nI have said that the bison is a harmless animal, but this of course is\r\nonly when you keep away from it, and a wounded bison should be approached\r\nand tracked up with caution, and in no case should a single tracker follow\r\nup a wounded bull. He should always have a companion to keep a general\r\nlook out in case of the bull suddenly charging the tracker when he is busy\r\nfollowing the trail. On one occasion a manager of mine went out shooting,\r\nwounded a bull, and then went round to a point to cut him off, and sent in\r\nthe only man he had to follow up the track and drive the bull on. He\r\nwaited for some time and then shouted, but received no answer, for the\r\npoor tracker was dead. He had evidently been charged by the bull when he\r\nwas busy tracking it, and was taken by surprise. By a curious coincidence\r\nmy manager had dreamed the night before that he had gone out with this\r\ntracker, that he had been killed by a bull, and that the body was found\r\nextended in the position in which it was ultimately found on the following\r\nday.\r\n\r\nClose to the place where the man was killed we had a capital illustration\r\nof the need for keeping a good look out when tracking. When out shooting\r\none evening with a friend, we wounded a solitary bull (which I have reason\r\nto suppose was the same bull that killed the tracker), and on the\r\nfollowing morning took up his track, which led down into a spot in the\r\nforest where, from some trees probably having been blown down in former\r\nyears, there was a little thicket of small trees and underwood. Into this\r\nthe bull had gone, and we soon found where he had been lying, and were\r\nproceeding to take up the track again, when one of our men, who stood a\r\nlittle way behind, and luckily, was looking about, said \"There's the\r\nbull.\" He had evidently heard us coming, got up, gone ten yards away, and\r\nwas waiting for a favourable moment to charge, and, had he done so when we\r\nwere in the thicket, he probably would have killed one of the party. My\r\nfriend, who was an old hand, and of course saw the danger at a glance,\r\ncleared out of the thicket with wonderful alertness, and the rest were not\r\nslow to follow his example. We then passed round the upper side of the\r\nthicket, and came down upon the bull in the more open forest, and soon\r\nkilled him. Just as we had done so, news came that a herd of bison was\r\ngrazing on a ridge about half or three-quarters of a mile or so away, and\r\nas our pursuit of them elucidates some points of practical importance, I\r\ngive a short description of the stalk and its accompanying circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe herd of bison, it appears, were just outside a jungly ravine which ran\r\nup from the main forest through the grass land. The jungle terminated just\r\nbelow a ridge of hill, along which we approached the spot. Overhanging the\r\nhollow were some rocks which afforded us a convenient place to creep\r\nbehind, and presently we lay down there, looking at the herd, which was\r\nbelow us, and about a hundred yards away. And then we found (as Mr.\r\nSanderson so often did that he at last gave up attacking herd bison) that\r\nit was impossible to fire at the bull, as he was screened by the cows. How\r\nlong we lay watching I cannot exactly tell, but as the day got hotter the\r\nbison began to move, and then we had a chance of firing at the big bull.\r\nThe herd, bull included, then entered the jungly ravine, and presently\r\nreappeared a little further down and on the right of the ravine with a\r\ncalf which had evidently been left in the ravine, and filed along the\r\nslope. The bull, however, had remained behind. Now comes a point of great\r\nimportance in following up big game, and which, curiously enough, has\r\nnever been noticed hitherto, at least I have not been able to meet with\r\nany reference to it in the many big game shooting books I have looked at.\r\nIf an animal is wounded, it is a common practice to follow it up at once,\r\nthe result of which is that it will often go off to a considerable\r\ndistance (which is often highly inconvenient) and frequently be lost. But\r\nif, instead of following the startled animal at once, a perfect silence is\r\nmaintained, and you remain where you are, the animal, the moment it is\r\ninside the jungle, will stand to listen, and if it can neither hear nor\r\nsee anything, will probably lie down to recover from the shock, and if it\r\ndoes so, will very probably not rise from the spot for a considerable\r\ntime. You have thus an opportunity of getting ahead of your quarry and\r\ncoming back to the margin of the forest from a direction opposite to that\r\nfrom which it naturally expects danger, and it will thus have to pass you\r\nagain in order to get further into the forest, and you will then, as I\r\nhave known from experience, get another shot. On this occasion it was of\r\ngreat importance to get between the wounded bull and the main forest\r\ntowards the foot of the Ghauts, and we accordingly resolved to go down the\r\ngrass land on the outside of the jungly ravine, enter it a good way down,\r\nand lie up to rest for some time, and then look up the wounded bull.\r\n\r\nAnd now I received a lesson that I shall never forget. We had taken our\r\nearly toast and tea, and had intended returning to breakfast, but we had\r\nbeen decoyed by the sport so far from home, and the weather was so hot,\r\nthat we could not face the task of toiling back in the heat of the sun,\r\nand besides, we had our wounded bull to look up. The prospect of remaining\r\nall day without food was not pleasant, but luckily I had a few small\r\nbiscuits in my pocket. Then we were afraid to drink the water, as at that\r\nseason it is not considered to be wholesome. \"Ah,\" said my friend, after\r\nfumbling in his pocket, \"we are all right. I have got one peppermint\r\nlozenge. We will divide it into four parts, and it will last the day.\"\r\nThis was my first introduction to the great practical value of the\r\npeppermint lozenge in taking away the sensation of thirst, and in hot\r\nclimates I now never go without them. But they should be made at a good\r\nchemist's, as the peppermint then has none of that nauseous, or, at any\r\nrate, very disagreeable, smell which accompanies ordinary peppermint\r\nlozenges. They are also very useful in travelling, and in India I always\r\ncarry them, as, if kept out longer in the morning than usual, they at once\r\nbanish hunger and thirst, and are, besides, very refreshing, and I feel\r\nsure would be invaluable in the case of troops marching in hot weather,\r\nand where good water is not to be had. They are also very useful when\r\ngoing out after a tiger, and when news of one is brought in my first order\r\nis to put up two peppermint lozenges. Another point of value I may here\r\nmention. Always, if there is a chance of your being kept out late, take a\r\nlantern and matches. We experienced the evil of the neglect of this\r\nprecaution when returning home. You may have starlight outside the forest,\r\nbut darkness within, and a lantern is, of course, a great aid, and it is\r\nso even when there is moonlight, as you may be either on the wrong side of\r\na ridge or have to pass through dark bottoms. But now as to the pursuit of\r\nthe bull.\r\n\r\nAfter resting for several hours we took our way up the ravine in the\r\ndirection of the point at which the bull entered it. And here we made a\r\ncardinal mistake, for we went together, whereas had one of us remained on\r\nthe grass land outside, we should almost certainly have got the bull. We,\r\nhowever, omitted to take this precaution, and proceeded up the ravine to\r\nwithin about fifty yards of the spot where the bull entered, when up he\r\ngot close to us, but without our being able to see him, and went out of\r\nthe ravine on to the grass land and down into the main forest beyond, into\r\nwhich we had neither time, strength, nor inclination to follow him. The\r\npreceding will be a good lesson to any young sportsman, firstly, as to the\r\nvalue of not following up a wounded animal at once, and, secondly, as to\r\ntaking every kind of precaution when you do. How often is sport spoiled\r\nfrom the want of appreciating the truism that a wall is no stronger than\r\nits weakest point. The importance of carefully guarding and refusing to be\r\ndecoyed away from the pass into the main forest is of such consequence\r\nthat I proceed to enforce it with another illustration.\r\n\r\nOne day I found a fine bull grazing on the margin of a piece of detached\r\njungle some five or six acres in extent; I got between him and the main\r\nforest, to which he would of course fly, fired at him, and he went at once\r\ninto the ravine, or rather jungle-clad hollow, in front of him. I then ran\r\nto the only pass from it into the main forest, and told the two people who\r\nwere with me to follow on the track of the bull, at which I should thus\r\nhave been able to get another shot in the event of his having strength\r\nenough to leave the five or six acres of jungle he had entered. I waited\r\nfor a considerable time, and at last went up the hill with the view of\r\nseeing what my people were about, and called out, to be answered by one\r\nman on the top of a hill on the other side, and by another from the top of\r\na tree, who said that the bison had attacked them, and that one of them\r\nhad run out of the jungle and the other up a tree. I called out to the\r\nman on the grass land to go and fetch a dog and some people from the\r\nvillage, and again returned to my pass, for had the bull once got down\r\ninto the main forest-which led to the foot of the Ghauts, we should\r\nprobably have lost him. After rather a long interval some natives appeared\r\nwith a dog, and I told them to drive the ravine, and soon there ensued a\r\nseries of charges, accompanied by the barking of the dog, and a general\r\nstate of confusion, from, which it was evident that the bison had lots of\r\ngo in him. Still I clung to the pass. At last my patience was worn out,\r\nand I went to look up the bull in the jungle. Horror of horrors! he made\r\noff in the very direction of the pass into the main forest, and had it not\r\nbeen for the dog we should probably have lost him, but I at once set on\r\nthe dog, and this had the desired effect of making the bull turn, when he\r\ncame towards us, looking for some one to charge. When he was a few yards\r\nfrom me I gave him a shot which turned him aside, and as he deflected he\r\npresented a good shot, and was soon killed.\r\n\r\nThe jumping, or rather bounding power of the bison is wonderful, and I was\r\naccidentally caused to ascertain it in this way. One evening, just at\r\nsundown, I found a bull in a very unexpected place, high up on a mountain,\r\nwith very precipitous sides. He was on the edge of a piece of jungly,\r\nswampy land, about half an acre in extent, and when I fired at him he went\r\ninto this, and I sent my second gun man round to drive him out. He soon\r\nappeared, took one look at me at a distance of about fifty yards, and then\r\ncharged with wonderful suddenness. I was young and active then, and ran\r\nsideways to the only tree--a small one on the open land--but I had just\r\ntime to save myself, for the bull, having struck or grazed the tree with\r\nhis shoulder, fell at my feet, and as he rose, his horn caught my coat\r\nabout the armpit and tore a hole in it. He galloped towards me with his\r\nnose up, but lowered his head as he approached me, evidently to clear me\r\naway. He, of course, was up again in a second, and disappeared over the\r\ncrest of the hill. The ground I was standing on sloped only slightly\r\nupward towards the point at which the bison emerged, there being at the\r\nspot a length of about eighty yards of comparatively flat land, which, of\r\ncourse, accounted for the swampy ground, which, by the way, had been\r\npartly created by the natives having at some remote time formed a small\r\ntank there. Well, the following morning I went to the spot with an English\r\nsporting companion, and said, \"This is the place where I was charged.\"\r\n\"But,\" he said, and so said the natives with him, \"there has never been a\r\nbison here at all,\" and as there had been some rain the day before, the\r\ntracks would, of course, have been plainly visible. As it turned out, we\r\nhappened to be standing between the tracks, and on measuring the distance\r\nbetween them, we found that the bull had covered twenty-one feet from\r\nhind-foot to hind-foot, and that, too, on ground which, as we have seen,\r\nsloped but very slightly.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this chapter without urging sportsmen to use every means\r\nin their power which can aid in the preservation of these harmless and\r\ninteresting animals; and I trust that every effort may be made not only to\r\nobtain a Game Preservation Act for India, but to have a special clause\r\ninserted in it with reference to cow bisons, and the imposition of a heavy\r\nline for killing one of them. Is not the intelligent preservation of game\r\none of the most prominent signs of advancing civilization?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] In Jerdon's \"Mammals of India,\" Roorkee, 1867, p. 304, however, I\r\nfind that it is stated that the bison do ravage the fields of the ryots,\r\nbut Mr. Sanderson has no mention of their doing so, and he had the best\r\nopportunities for observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nGold mines are as uncertain as women, and yet from either it seems\r\nimpossible to keep away. Perhaps it is this very uncertainty which\r\nconstitutes the chief charm of both. But, however that may be, it is\r\ncertain that about gold in general, whether visible or prospective, there\r\nis such a degree of attractiveness that, as the Kanarese proverb puts it,\r\nif gold is to be seen even a corpse will open its mouth; and I feel sure\r\nas I write, that in this chapter at least I can count not only on\r\nattention, but on a general attitude of expectancy in the mind of the\r\nreader. And from one point of view he will be fairly satisfied, for the\r\nhistory of gold mining in Mysore has quite a romantic cast, and in the\r\nhands of a skilful novelist, there might be extracted from it much\r\nliterary capital. The foremost fact indeed which I have to give has almost\r\na sensational flavour, and at first sight seems a mere dream. We often\r\nread of fields of golden grain, but that corn should ever, by any process\r\nof nature, have on its ears grains of gold, seems beyond belief. And yet\r\nthe fact of grains of gold being found on the ears of the rice plants is\r\nprobably the very earliest tradition connected with gold, and it is not\r\nimprobable that the circumstance may have been one of the means of calling\r\nattention to the existence of gold in Mysore. An account of this tradition\r\nis to be found in the \"Selections from the Records of the Mysore\r\nGovernment,\"[25] and from them it appears that Lieutenant John Warren,\r\nwhen he was employed in surveying the eastern boundary of Mysore in 1800,\r\nwas told by a Brahman that \"In prosperous years when the gods favoured the\r\nZillah of Kadogi (a small village on the west bank of the Pennar river,\r\nHoskote Talook, 15 miles from Bangalore) with an ample harvest now and\r\nthen grains of gold were found on the ears of the paddy (rice plants)\r\ngrown under the tank lying close to the north of that village.\" And in\r\nthis connection I may mention that, when visiting the Kolar mines last\r\nJanuary, I found, in the course of a conversation with the head man of the\r\nvillage of Ooregum, that he was aware of this tradition, and that grains\r\nof gold were said to have been seen on the rice plants at a village about\r\nfifteen miles distant from his own. The explanation of this is extremely\r\nsimple, as the rice plants are usually grown in nurseries and transplanted\r\nin bunches of several plants, after which the fields are flooded, and in\r\nheavy floods (and this accounts for the gold having been found in the\r\nyears which are prosperous from the abundant rain) the plants would often\r\nbe quite submerged. With the water no doubt came grains of gold, which\r\nwere deposited on the rice plants, and as these grew, the grains of gold\r\nwould naturally rise with them, and thus often be found adhering to the\r\nroughly-coated grain.\r\n\r\nAfter the attention of Lieutenant Warren was called to the subject, he\r\nseems to have taken some trouble in investigating it, and having heard a\r\nvague report that gold had been found in the earth somewhere near a small\r\nhill about nine miles east of Budiakote, offered a reward for information\r\nregarding this, and shortly afterwards a ryot of the village offered to\r\nshow him the place, which was close to his village. He visited the spot\r\nin question on February 17th, 1802, \"when the women of the village were\r\nassembled, and, each being provided with a small broom and vaning basket,\r\nand hollow board to receive the earth, they went to a jungle on the west\r\nof the village. Here they entered some small nullahs, or rather breaks in\r\nthe ground, and removing the gravel with their hands, they swept the earth\r\nunderneath into their vaning baskets, by the help of which they further\r\ncleared it of the smaller stones and threw it into the hollow board above\r\nmentioned. Having thus got enough earth together, they adjourned to a tank\r\nand placed the hollow boards containing the earth in the water, but just\r\ndeep enough for it to overflow when resting on the ground, and no more.\r\nThen they stirred the earth with the hand, but keeping it over the centre\r\nof the board, so that the metal should fall into the depression by its own\r\nweight, and the earth wash over the edges. After a few minutes' stirring,\r\nthey put the metallic matter thus freed of earth into a piece of broken\r\npot, but only after examining it for gold, which they did by inclining the\r\nboard and passing water over the metallic sediment which adhered to it.\r\nThey thus drove the light particles before the water, leaving the heavier\r\nmetal behind just at the edge where it could easily be seen, however small\r\nthe quantity.\" Lieutenant Warren, having afterwards heard that gold was\r\nextracted from mines near Marikoppa, three miles from Ooregum, visited\r\nfour of the mines, the descent into which was made by means of small foot\r\nholes which had been made in their sides. The first was two feet in\r\nbreadth and four in length with a depth of about thirty feet, and in\r\ndistance fifty feet (of galleries I presume), the others were from thirty\r\nto forty-five feet deep. \"The miners extracted the stones (how we are not\r\ninformed) and they were passed from hand to hand in baskets by the miners\r\nwho were stationed at different points for the purpose of banking the\r\nstones. The women then took them to a large rock, and pounded them to\r\ndust. The latter was then taken to a well and washed by the same process\r\nas that used when washing the earth for gold, when about an equal quantity\r\nof gold was found to that procured from an equal quantity of the\r\nauriferous earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe only people, writes Lieutenant Warren, who devote their time to\r\nsearching-for gold are Pariahs, who work as follows. \"When they resolve on\r\nsinking a mine, they assemble to the number of ten or twelve from\r\ndifferent villages. Then they elect a Daffadar, or head man, to\r\nsuperintend the work, and sell the gold, and they subscribe money to buy\r\nlamp oil, and the necessary iron tools, then partly from knowledge of the\r\nground, and partly from the idea they have, that the tract over which a\r\npeacock has been observed to fly and alight, is that of a vein of gold,\r\nthey fix on a spot and begin to mine.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the condition of gold mining in Mysore about the end of\r\nthe last and the beginning of this century, but in ancient times mining\r\nwas carried on by the natives to very considerable depths, and I am\r\ninformed by Mr. B. D. Plummer, who has had ten years' experience of mines\r\nat Kolar, and worked the Mysore and Nundydroog mines, that the old native\r\nworkings went down to a depth of about 260 feet. These, which were all\r\nchoked up, were followed down to the bottom, and valuable lodes were found\r\nat about 150 to 260 feet. Nothing was found in the old native workings,\r\nbut remains of old chatties (earthenware pots) and the wooden props put in\r\nto secure the sides. The native workings, in the opinion of Captain\r\nPlummer, were evidently carried on with skill and efficiency, and appear\r\nto be of great antiquity. Large quantities of water were found, requiring\r\npumping machinery working day and night for its removal. How the natives\r\nin olden times got rid of the water is not known. It is supposed that\r\nthey must have done so by chatties, and by hand, with the aid of large\r\nnumbers of people. As no native iron tools[26] were found in the cases of\r\nthe two above-mentioned mines, it is evident that they were deliberately\r\nabandoned, either from excess of water in them, or some unknown cause. As\r\nthe lodes they worked at the depths they reached were rich, it is probable\r\nthat the miners could no longer contend with the difficulty of removing\r\nthe large quantities of water. I am informed by Mr. Plummer that the main\r\nlodes where the natives have formerly worked have, in nearly every case,\r\nproved successful. Mr. Plummer has examined other districts in the\r\nprovince, extending more than 100 miles north of Mysore city, and thinks\r\nthat there is a very large mining future for the Mysore country. I am\r\ninformed by one of the mine managers that from the quantity of charcoal\r\nfound in the old native workings, it is probable that the natives first of\r\nall burnt the rock so as to make it the more easy of extraction, just as\r\nthey now burn granite rock in order the more easily to split off the\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nAs the facts connected with these mines were brought very fully to the\r\nnotice of the Government at such an early date, it at first sight seems\r\nstrange that we have to skip over a period of about seventy years till we\r\nagain meet, in the \"Selections\" previously quoted from, any further notice\r\nof the mines; but the neglect of them was evidently owing to the similar\r\nneglect of coffee and other industries, which might have been pushed\r\nforward at a much earlier date, and most certainly would have been, had\r\nthe Government taken pains to see that the information so frequently\r\nobtained was published in an available and readable form, instead of being\r\nburied in the various offices of the State. That more efforts were not\r\nmade in this direction was probably owing to the fact that the Government\r\nofficers did not perceive the widespread effect that the introduction of\r\nEuropean capital would have on the agriculture of the country, and,\r\nconsequently, on the finances of the State--a subject referred to in my\r\nintroductory chapter, and to which I shall again allude in the chapter on\r\nCoorg--while they were under the erroneous impression that Europeans would\r\nprobably be a cause of annoyance to the Government and the people. We find\r\na characteristic survival of the last idea in the \"Selections,\" and in\r\nClause X. of the conditions under which, in 1873, the first leave to mine\r\nwas granted by the Government of Mysore, it is declared that, \"In the\r\nevent of the grantee causing annoyance or obstruction to any class of the\r\npeople, or to the officers of Government, the chief commissioner reserves\r\nthe power of annulling the mining right thus granted.\" But such\r\napprehensions, I need hardly say, have long since passed away, and\r\ncertainly within my long experience they never existed in Southern India\r\nin the case of the planters who, as a body, have always been encouraged by\r\nthe State, and have always got on well with it and the people, though, of\r\ncourse, as in all countries, there are occasionally individuals who cannot\r\nbring themselves into harmony with any person, or condition of things.\r\n\r\nAnd now, before proceeding with my narrative of gold mining in Mysore, I\r\npause for one moment to note the rather remarkable fact that it seems\r\nimpossible to find in old records or inscriptions any reference to gold\r\nmining in Mysore.[27] As to this I have made diligent inquiry, from the\r\nlibrarian of H. H. the Maharajah, from a member of the Archæological\r\nSurvey of Mysore, and in every quarter that occurred to me. I was informed\r\nby a European resident at Bangalore that, at the Eurasian settlement near\r\nthat city, there is a stone pillar with an inscription said by tradition\r\nto relate to gold mining, but I can hardly suppose it possible that this\r\ncould have escaped the notice of the officers of the Archæological Survey.\r\nOne of the officers of this department informed me that, in consequence of\r\nthe absence of traditions regarding gold mining, he inferred that mining\r\nin Mysore must have been carried on from very remote times. But it is time\r\nto proceed with the history of mining in Mysore.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, from the \"Selections,\" that a Mr. Lavelle on the 20th of\r\nAugust, 1873, applied for the right to carry on mining operations in\r\nKolar. Two years previously he had examined portions of the Kolar district\r\n(without any grant it would seem, from no mention of one being made), and\r\nfound three auriferous strata, in one of which he sunk a shaft to the\r\ndepth of eighteen feet, and found gold increase in quality and size as he\r\nwent downwards. In the event of a mining right being granted he proposed\r\nto begin work again in November. After some correspondence came a letter\r\nfrom the chief commissioner, dated September 16th, 1874, submitting\r\nconditions (which must be regarded as final) as the basis of an agreement\r\n(to be afterwards legally drawn up) to be entered into between the\r\nGovernment and Mr. Lavelle. It is unnecessary to recapitulate all the\r\nconditions; suffice it to say that the right to mine in Kolar was to\r\nextend over twenty years, and that a royalty of ten per cent. on all\r\nmetals and metallic ores, and of twenty per cent. on all precious stones,\r\nwas to be paid. On September 20th, 1874, Mr. Lavelle accepted the terms,\r\nbut what he did or did not do as regards mining does not appear in the\r\n\"Selections,\" and I find it merely stated therein that on March 28th,\r\n1876, leave was given him to transfer his rights to other parties. It,\r\nhowever, appears from a statement made by Mr. Lavelle in 1885 to the\r\nspecial correspondent of the \"Madras Mail,\"[28] that a small syndicate was\r\nformed, and some work carried on in the native style, though little\r\nsuccess seems to have been met with, and the work was abandoned. About a\r\nyear afterwards it was again recommenced by Mr. Lavelle, who in the\r\nmeanwhile had been prospecting in other parts of Southern India, and he\r\nsucceeded in once more attracting attention to the Kolar field, and\r\nsubsequently various companies were formed, but so disappointing were the\r\nresults obtained that all were practically closed in 1882, except the\r\nMysore mine, which was working to a small extent. In February, 1883, the\r\nNundydroog mine was ordered to be closed, and almost every other mine was\r\nin a state of collapse. Caretakers were put in and only a little work\r\ndone. Early in 1884, when only twelve or thirteen thousand pounds of their\r\ncapital were left, the Mysore shareholders were convened. Some were for\r\nclosing at once and dividing the remaining capital, but, acting on the\r\nadvise of Messrs. John Taylor and Sons, of 6, Queen Street Place, London,\r\nit was, fortunately for the province of Mysore, determined to spend it on\r\nthe mine. The shares were then as low as tenpence. The company began to\r\nget gold about the end of 1884, and the prospect improved so much that the\r\nNundydroog mine in May, 1885, was enabled to raise money on debentures,\r\nand so to again carry on work. If the shareholders of the Mysore company\r\nhad not persevered, it is almost absolutely certain that the whole of the\r\nKolar gold field would have been permanently abandoned. This is just one\r\nof those cases which cheer the sinking hopes of shareholders, and attract\r\nvast sums of money to gold mines; and no wonder, when we find the chairman\r\nof the Mysore company apologizing lately because he could not declare a\r\ndividend of more than fifty per cent.; that up to the end of 1892 the gold\r\nsold by the company realized £1,149,430 2s. 1d., and that the total sum\r\npaid in dividends amounted to £602,156 10s. 6d.\r\n\r\nThe Mysore mine had been sunk to a depth of about 200 feet when it was\r\nproposed that the project should be abandoned. Just below this depth the\r\nminers struck the Champion lode on which the Mysore, Ooregum, Nundydroog,\r\nBalaghaut, and Indian Consolidated Companies are working. The Mysore mine\r\nhas now been sunk to a depth of over 1,200 feet, Ooregum 850 feet, and\r\nNundydroog over 860 feet. The lode is not richer per ton, as is commonly\r\nsupposed, on greater depths being reached. The yield per ton is probably\r\nabout the same, though from larger quantities being taken out, and the use\r\nof the rock drill, which causes a large extraction of country rock, the\r\nproduct per ton of quartz is apparently smaller. The specimens now found\r\nare as good as ever.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the Champion lode are briefly these. In the interior\r\nof a surrounding of granite there is a great basin of hornblende rock of\r\nschistose character, and through this, at an angle of about forty-five\r\ndegrees, runs the lode. This is not of continuous thickness. In some\r\nplaces it is four or five feet wide, in others runs down to an almost\r\nvanishing point, and then again thickens. In the case of the mines now\r\nworking on this lode, the basin of hornblende is more than two miles in\r\nwidth, and is possibly many thousands of feet in depth, so there seems to\r\nbe a reasonable prospect of there being a long future before the workers\r\non the Champion lode.\r\n\r\nThe Kolar gold field is about seven miles in length, and averages about\r\ntwo to three miles in width. There are in all fourteen mines, but two of\r\nthem are practically stopped. The general appearance of it is at present\r\nby no means attractive, as the land is rocky and sterile, and unfavourable\r\nto the growth of trees, but, from the appearance of some of the Baubul\r\ntrees, I feel sure that if large pits for the trees were dug, and filled\r\nwith soil from the low-lying ground, a great deal might be done to\r\nbeautify the field, by planting here and there groups of Baubul and other\r\nhardy trees indigenous to the locality. As I thought it would be\r\ninteresting, and perhaps useful, to give some idea of life on the fields,\r\nI asked one of the ladies resident there to supply me with some notes for\r\npublication, and her observations on the situation from a social and\r\ngeneral point of view are as follows.\r\n\r\n\"You ask me for some notes on the field, and I may begin by telling you\r\nthat we usually rise about half-past six, when the menkind go off to their\r\noffices, or underground, as the ease may be. We have tiffin between twelve\r\nand one, and dinner at half-past seven. Breakfast is generally at about\r\neight, and the managers commonly have theirs sent down to the office.\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon, that is to say, when the five o'clock whistle blows, we\r\nplay tennis, or else go down to the Gymkana ground to watch the cricket.\r\nSometimes there is a gymkana in which we all take great interest,\r\nparticularly in those races called ladies' events, when the winners\r\npresent their prizes to the ladies who have nominated them. The great\r\ndrawback to the gold fields at present is the absence of some general\r\nmeeting-place or club, but it is hoped that by next year this want will\r\nbe supplied, as the Ooregum, Nundydroog, and Champion Reefs Companies have\r\ncombined to build a hall, which is to contain a billiard-room, card-room,\r\nlibrary, etc., and there is to be a tennis court in the compound.\r\n\r\n\"One of the great pleasures is gardening. The plants that grow best are\r\njalaps, sunflowers, roses, cornflowers, nasturtiums, verbenas, and\r\ngeraniums, all of which, with the exception of the two first-named plants,\r\nrequire water constantly. The creepers that grow best are passion-flowers,\r\nand a small kind of green creeper with convolvulus flowers, the name of\r\nwhich I do not know. Honeysuckle also grows, though but slowly. Trees have\r\nrecently been planted in the various compounds, and also along some parts\r\nof the road leading to the bungalows, but owing to the shallowness of the\r\nsoil, and the roots so soon reaching the rock, they seldom grow to any\r\nsize. Some casuarinas in the Mysore mine camp have grown to about twenty\r\nfeet in height, but these have now struck the rock, and most of them are\r\ndying.\r\n\r\n\"We have occasional visitors, many of them being shareholders in the\r\nvarious mines, bringing with them introductions from England, and wishing\r\nto inspect all the works, stamps, etc., on the surface, and very often\r\ngoing underground. Several ladies have been taken down the mines lately,\r\nbut they do not seem to care for it much, for though of course it is\r\ninteresting, still the fatigue of going down so many feet on ladders is\r\ngreat. The mines, too, in many parts are dirty and wet, and amongst other\r\ndisagreeables are the cockroaches, which are enormous, and the stinging\r\nants. Ladies too, I find, are as a rule disappointed at not seeing more\r\n'visible gold.' I believe they cherish generally some idea of picking up a\r\nnice little nugget to keep as a souvenir of their expedition.\r\n\r\n\"None of the mines have any 'cages,' as they are called, so if one does\r\nnot want to go down by the ladders, one can only go in the box in which\r\nthe quartz comes up, and as this is only two feet square and four feet\r\ndeep, the journey by it would be decidedly uncomfortable. At every eighty\r\nfeet, I may mention, you come to a small wooden platform (or level) where\r\nyou can rest, and from which branch off the cross cuts and drives, or\r\nnarrow passages. The depths of the different mines vary a great deal,\r\nMysore being as low as 1,400 feet, the greatest depth sunk at present,\r\nwhile the least depth sunk is about 300 feet. Ladies going underground\r\nhave to wear suitable attire. Skirts would be quite useless. A long coat,\r\nor short skirt reaching to the knees, and knickerbockers, is the most\r\ncomfortable dress for the occasion. Very strong boots should be worn.\r\n\r\n\"Many of the miners and people employed in the gold fields have joined the\r\nVolunteers. There is now quite a strong corps of about 100 men, some being\r\nEurasians, but the majority are either English or Italians. Once a year\r\nsome 'bigwig' comes from Bangalore to review them. There is a\r\nsergeant-instructor on the field, and the adjutant comes very frequently\r\nto see them drill, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Round the various large tanks about six or eight miles away from the\r\nmines excellent snipe shooting is to be had, and duck and teal are also to\r\nbe found. Spotted deer and bears are sometimes shot by sportsmen from the\r\nmines, but for those one must go further away. The fishing is not\r\nconsidered to be very good, but perhaps those who fish do not know how to\r\nset to work. The natives sometimes bring very large tank fish round for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n\"Driving and riding are not very enjoyable, owing to the terribly bad\r\nstate of the roads. When the railway to the mines is opened, which it soon\r\nwill be, I am happy to say, the roads will be better. At present the heavy\r\nmachinery for the mines, boilers, etc.--sometimes taking sixty bullocks\r\nto draw them--cut up the roads dreadfully. These will of course come by\r\nrail directly the line is open for traffic. The supplies, vegetables,\r\nfruit, etc., come from Bangalore three times a week, each mine keeping a\r\n'Supply boy' (servant), who goes in from Kolar Road (our railway station,\r\nseven miles from the mines), and returns the following day. We get mutton\r\nand beef from the local butcher, and also good bread from the bakery on\r\nthe field. Our butter comes from Bangalore, and from there we obtain,\r\npeas, potatoes, French beans, tomatoes, cauliflowers, vegetable marrow,\r\nand lettuces, and also fruit, such as apples, peaches, grapes, plantains,\r\ncustard apples, melons, and sometimes pine-apples. Servants on the whole\r\nare good. Most of them come from Madras. Wages are much higher on the gold\r\nfields than in Bangalore--head butlers, 16 rupees; ayahs, 12 to 14 rupees;\r\nchokras, 10 to 11 rupees; cooks, 11 to 14 rupees; and gardeners, 10 to 16\r\nrupees a month. Many of them leave domestic service and take work in the\r\nmines, where they get higher wages very often.\"\r\n\r\nAs the elevation of Kolar is about 2,700 feet above sea level, the climate\r\nis for many months of the year extremely agreeable, and it would, so far\r\nas my experience goes, be difficult to find a more exhilarating and more\r\nexquisitely-tempered atmosphere than that of Kolar in the month of\r\nJanuary--at least such was my conclusion when I stayed with my friends at\r\nthe field last January. Nor did I hear anyone there complain of the\r\nclimate, which, from the appearance of my host (who looked as if he had\r\nnever left England) and others on the mines, must be a very healthy one,\r\nand in proof of this I may mention that Mr. Plummer, whom I have\r\npreviously quoted, told me that the European miners had as good health as\r\nminers have in England. Cholera has on several occasions broken out\r\namongst the coolies, but this was rather a proof of the want of attention\r\npaid to sanitation and water supply, as none I believe has occurred since\r\nan improved water supply has been introduced by all the companies now\r\npumping it up from depths of 200 feet from the bottoms of abandoned\r\nshafts. There was a remarkable confirmation of the connection between\r\ncholera and water supply and sanitation one year, and the first company\r\nwhich paid attention to these points had no cholera amongst its people,\r\nwhile most of the other mines had more or less of the disease. I may\r\nmention here a fact to which I have alluded in my chapter on coffee\r\nplanting in Mysore--namely, that Europeans in Mysore have been so little\r\nliable to cholera that in sixty years there has only been one death from\r\nit amongst the European officials of the province, and one doubtful case\r\namongst the planters.\r\n\r\nAs regards mining and the extraction of gold, there is little to be said.\r\nI inspected the works and the rock drills. These work through the agency\r\nof compressed air, and at a cost of 15 rupees a day for coal for each\r\ndrill, the same tool which is used in drilling by hand. It is doubtful\r\nwhether hand-drilling is not cheaper, but the latter is far slower, and\r\nhence does not pay as well, rapid progress being absolutely essential.\r\nWhen working with rock drills, a shaft can be sunk 10 to 20 feet a month,\r\nagainst 7 to 8 feet by hand, and a level may on the average be driven 45\r\nto 50 feet a month by rock drills against 10 or 12 feet by hand. When,\r\nhowever, a large surface for operating on is exposed, hand-drilling may be\r\nprofitably employed. This is interesting as illustrating the fact that\r\nwhere labour is cheap machines seldom pay, and this is particularly worth\r\nmentioning for the benefit of those who have thought that it would be\r\nuseful to introduce agricultural machinery into India. After looking at\r\nthe rock drills I inspected the gold extraction works. The processes here\r\nneed not detain us long. The quartz is first broken by stone-breakers\r\nlike those used in England. The broken stone is then placed in an iron\r\ntrough (battery box), and is pounded by iron stampers, which of course are\r\nworked by machinery. In front of this trough is a fine sieve. Water is\r\nincessantly run into the trough, and as it overflows, carries with it all\r\nthe quartz which has been pounded sufficiently to pass through the sieve.\r\nThe water, mingled with this finely powdered quartz, then falls on to a\r\nsloping plate of copper coated with quicksilver, which amalgamates with,\r\nand so detains, the gold. The deposit thus formed is scraped off the\r\nsheets of copper at intervals of about eight hours, and formed into balls\r\nof various sizes, which consist of about one-half gold and one-half\r\nquicksilver. The latter is subsequently separated from the gold by\r\nprocesses which I need not describe, and the gold is afterwards formed\r\ninto bars for export.\r\n\r\nI inquired particularly as to the rates of wages. These are, for coolies\r\nworking underground, from 7 to 8 annas a day (with the rupee at par one\r\nanna is equal to 1-1/2d., and 8 annas would therefore amount to 1s.).\r\nThose who work rock drills in mines, 12 annas to a rupee a day; ordinary\r\ncoolies working aboveground, 4 to 8 annas; and women, 2 to 4 annas a day.\r\nThe working population on the field numbers about 10,000, while 20,000\r\nmore, who work for varying periods of the year, reside in the neighbouring\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nI was much struck with the fact that no advances whatever are given to\r\ncoolies by the companies, as is the case with men working on plantations,\r\nand I would particularly call the attention of planters to this, as it\r\nproves what I have elsewhere stated--namely, that where labour rises to a\r\ncomparatively high rate no advances are necessary, and I feel sure that if\r\nplanters would resolve to reduce gradually the amount of advances, they\r\nmight ultimately be altogether dispensed with.\r\n\r\nMy next subject of inquiry relating to labour was as to the probable total\r\namount paid for it, and, from an estimate made for me by a very competent\r\nauthority residing on the mines, I believe that the following account is\r\nsubstantially correct. The amount of wages paid monthly to native\r\nlabourers and the small number of Eurasians working on the mines is about\r\n2 lakhs of rupees. To natives who fell and bring in timber for fuel about\r\n80,000 rupees monthly are paid. On quarrying and carting granite, and in\r\nbuilding, about 30,000 rupees a month are spent; on the carriage of\r\nmaterials from the railway about 15,000 rupees, and probably from 5,000 to\r\n10,000 rupees on local products such as straw, grain, oil, mats, bamboos,\r\ntiles, etc. Now, if we take no account of the last two items, and deduct\r\n10,000 rupees from the second and third, we shall have a fair estimate of\r\nthree lakhs of rupees a month as the amount spent on the Kolar gold field\r\nin wages, which, taking the rupee at par (and I think I am justified in\r\ndoing so, as for expenditure in India by labourers it goes about as far as\r\nit ever did), amounts to £360,000 a year. And this great sum is earned by\r\npeople who either have land and work for occasional periods of the year on\r\nthe mines, or by labourers, who, when they have saved enough money from\r\ntheir wages (which they could do with ease in a year), will acquire and\r\ncultivate a small holding. A large proportion of this sum of £360,000 a\r\nyear--probably two-thirds of it--goes to improving the status and\r\ncondition of the agricultural and labouring classes, and I need hardly add\r\nthat this not only leads to an improvement of the resources of the State,\r\nbut enables the people the better to contend with famine and times of\r\nscarcity, and thus still further improves the financial condition of the\r\nGovernment. And it is largely in consequence of the great sums brought\r\ninto Mysore by the planters and the gold companies that the revenues of\r\nMysore are in such a nourishing condition, and that year after year the\r\nannual budget presents an appearance more and more favourable.\r\n\r\nAnd here this question naturally arises. What can the Government of Mysore\r\ndo to stimulate the employment of labour in mining, and thus still further\r\nstrengthen the financial position of the State? I am prepared to show that\r\nit can do much to stimulate the opening of new mines, and also to\r\nencourage many of those now in existence which have not as yet been able\r\nto pay dividends.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see by a glance at the map that the auriferous tracts of\r\nMysore (to which I shall presently more particularly allude) are of great\r\nextent, and, judging from the report of the geological surveyor employed\r\nby the Government, and especially from the existence of numerous old\r\nnative workings, there is no reason why prizes even greater than the best\r\nof those already obtained should not exist. Now one of the greatest\r\nobstacles in the way of rapid progress lies in the fact that before mining\r\ncan be got fairly under weigh much preliminary work has to be done, and\r\nthe shareholders have therefore a long time to wait before any paying\r\nreturn can be obtained. But if the preliminary work, such as the providing\r\nof water, the collection of building materials, and the making of roads,\r\netc., were carried out before a company was formed, mining could be begun\r\nat once, and results rapidly arrived at, and the frittering away of money,\r\nboth in England and India, that at present necessarily occurs, would be\r\naverted. Now the country has already been largely explored, and the\r\nGovernment is therefore in a position to know the places where favourable\r\nresults will probably be obtained, and as the State, besides the other\r\nadvantages I have previously pointed out, gets a royalty on the gold, it\r\nhas a natural interest in doing its utmost to select the most favourable\r\nsites for new mining operations. Such sites then should, with the aid of\r\nexperienced mining advisers, be selected by the Government, which itself\r\nshould execute the preliminary works previously specified, and then\r\nadvertise the blocks, so selected and prepared, for sale in the London\r\nmarket. For such prepared blocks purchasers could readily be found, and if\r\nthe price they paid merely covered the bare cost of the preliminary works,\r\nthe expenditure of capital that would thus be stimulated, with all its\r\nconsequent direct and indirect advantages to the province, would amply\r\nrepay the Government for its trouble and outlay.\r\n\r\nBut the State may give yet another stimulus to mining, which, I feel sure,\r\nwould prove of great advantage to the State. The present royalty is five\r\nper cent. on the value of the gold produced, and from this source the\r\nGovernment last year received 5 lakhs and 18,000 rupees. Now the\r\nprosperous companies which are paying good dividends do not feel this to\r\nbe a very serious burden, but it is a serious burden--every shilling of\r\nexpenditure indeed is--to a company which has not begun to pay dividends,\r\nand I would suggest that, till a company is able to pay dividends,\r\none-half of the royalty, or, better still, the whole of it, might be\r\nremitted. This sum would by no means be lost to the State, for does not\r\nthe milk that is left in the cow go to the calf?\r\n\r\nThe measures I have proposed would be of such obvious advantage to the\r\nState that, were I a shareholder, or intending investor, in mines in\r\nMysore, I should have no hesitation in suggesting their adoption, but it\r\nmay be as well to mention that I am neither.\r\n\r\nI drove one afternoon with my host to the court on the field, and had some\r\nconversation with the magistrate regarding thefts at the mines, and it\r\ncertainly appears that a special Act is required to check the stealing of\r\ngold. Sponge-gold (i.e., gold from which the quicksilver has been\r\nevaporated), quartz, or gold amalgam, if found in the possession of any\r\nperson, renders the individual liable to prosecution, if the possession of\r\ngold in any of these forms cannot be satisfactorily accounted for. But the\r\nindividual cannot be called to account for having ordinary pure gold in\r\npossession. Now in a man's possession at the mines there has been found\r\nall the means of separating the gold by quicksilver, and it is therefore\r\nquite clear that gold stolen in either of the first three mentioned forms\r\nmay, after having been deprived of its concomitant impurities, be held by\r\nan individual to any amount, and even by a workman earning 6d. a day,\r\nwithout his being liable to be called upon to account for its possession.\r\nSome Act to meet this kind of case is then clearly required--an Act\r\nsimilar to our Mysore Coffee-stealing Prevention Act, which provides that\r\nany person not a planter is liable to be called upon to account for coffee\r\nin his possession.\r\n\r\nA difficult point occurs where quartz is found in a hut occupied by\r\nseveral people, as it is impossible to charge any one person with being in\r\nillegal possession of the article. There are numerous evidences of gold\r\nstealing, and certainly some summary process ought to be established with\r\nthe view of checking these thefts. I may add that the Government is much\r\ninterested in this matter, as five per cent. of the gold belongs to it,\r\nand is handed over in the shape of royalty. Those who are most concerned\r\nshould bring the matter annually before the members of the Representative\r\nAssembly. Even in England remedies for, or mitigations of, evils are not\r\nprovided without much continuous parliamentary hammering.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the subject of gold stealing with the magistrate, I\r\ncalled on the manager of the Mysore mine, and afterwards went with my host\r\nto a lawn tennis party at the house of the doctor of the mines, who is\r\nemployed by the various companies. He has a comfortable bungalow, which\r\nis at a considerable elevation above the level of the valley, and commands\r\nan extensive view of the surrounding country and of the distant hills.\r\nAbove the house, and at some little distance on one side of it, stands the\r\nhospital, and on a knoll just below, the building of the new Roman\r\nCatholic church was in progress, and the walls were nearly finished. From\r\nthe doctor's bungalow a good general view of the whole field can be\r\nobtained, and I was particularly struck with the number of buildings to be\r\nseen in all directions. I was told that from this point as many as thirty\r\ntall chimneys can be counted.\r\n\r\nThere is a great want of water in the field, for purposes connected with\r\nthe separation of the gold from the quartz, and tanks are being provided\r\nto store it. I venture to suggest that a considerable distance of the\r\ncatchment area on the sides, and especially at the back, of the tanks\r\nshould be honeycombed with pits, as the water, which is often largely lost\r\nfrom falling in heavy deluges, would thus percolate into the ground, and\r\nso find its way into the bed of the tank by degrees. I may mention that a\r\ngreat effect has been produced in the case of a tank on one of my coffee\r\nestates by thus digging pits to catch water that would otherwise run\r\ndirectly down into the tank, to be largely lost by the overflow during\r\nheavy rains, and a similar effect has been produced on the property of a\r\nneighbour. In fact, the effect produced by such pits on the supply of\r\nwater in tanks is far greater than one could have imagined to be possible,\r\nand I may therefore, in passing, call particular attention to the\r\nadvisability of such pits being made near tanks used for agricultural\r\npurposes. On the margins of the tanks, and in parts of the bed where\r\nsufficient soil exists, trees should be planted, with the view of\r\ndiminishing evaporation from the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nWhen the railway is completed, soil might easily be brought into the\r\nfield oil trucks, and the pits dug for trees should be filled with it. The\r\nplanting of trees in and around the field would certainly be beneficial in\r\nmany obvious ways, and would improve the climate and probably affect, not\r\nperhaps the amount, but the distribution of the rainfall. I would suggest\r\nthat if earth closets were used by the people, and the used earth spread\r\naround the trees, there would be a great improvement in their growth. This\r\nwould at once improve the sanitation of the field and beautify it at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nThe reader has now probably learned enough of this rising settlement,[29]\r\nand I have only to add that on the day following I returned to Bangalore,\r\nafter having had a most pleasant and interesting time of it with my\r\nfriends on the Kolar field.\r\n\r\nI next pass to a brief mention of the other auriferous tracts in Mysore,\r\nwhich were surveyed in 1887 by Mr. R. Bruce Foote, Superintendent of the\r\nGeological Survey of India, who, in connection with his investigations\r\nbetween February 2nd and May 7th of that year, travelled no less than\r\n1,300 miles in Mysore in marching and field work. A full report of his\r\nwork appears in the \"Selections,\"[30] and this is accompanied by a map in\r\nwhich Mr. Foote has sketched out the distribution of the auriferous rocks.\r\nIn the \"Selections\" alluded to there, is also a \"Report on the Auriferous\r\nTracts in Mysore,\" by Mr. M. F. Lavelle, and \"Notes on the Occurrence of\r\nGold and other Minerals in Mysore,\" by Mr. Walter Marsh, Mining Engineer.\r\nBut in the brief remarks I have to make I shall confine my attention to\r\nMr. Foote's Report.\r\n\r\nMr. Foote informs us that the chief gold-yielding rocks of Southern India\r\nbelong to one great geological system, to which, from the rocks forming it\r\noccurring very largely in the Dharwar country, he two years previously\r\ngave the name of the Dharwar System, as he saw the necessity of separating\r\nthem from the great Gneissic System, with which they had formerly been\r\ngrouped. In his long tour in Mysore he found that every important\r\nauriferous tract visited lies within one or other of the areas of the\r\nDharwar rocks, or forms an outlying patch of the same. These Dharwar\r\nrocks, it appears, are the auriferous series in Mysore, the ceded\r\ndistricts, and the Southern Maharatta country.\r\n\r\nMr. Foote groups the auriferous rock series of Mysore into four\r\ngroups--the central, west-central, western, and the eastern--the last\r\ngroup being formed by the Kolar gold field, which was not included in the\r\ntracts Mr. Foote was called upon to visit. He then gives a systematic\r\naccount of his examination of the country, beginning with the central, and\r\nending with the western group.\r\n\r\nHe examined ten auriferous tracts or localities in the central group,\r\nbeginning with the Holgen workings near the southern border of the\r\nprovince, and ending with the Hale Kalgudda locality near the northern\r\nborder, and reports more or less favourably on five out of the ten\r\nlocalities in question. For brevity I use the numbers into which he has\r\ndivided the localities he regards as more or less promising. Of part of\r\nnumber three, he says that his examination, though but a cursory one, led\r\nhim to regard it \"very favourably,\" and of another part, he says that the\r\nwhole outline indicated, which is seven miles long by about a mile wide,\r\nis deserving of very close examination, and the reefs of being prospected\r\nto some depth. As regards number five, he reports the existence of old\r\nnative workings occupying a considerable area, and which showed evidence\r\nof much work being done. Fine reefs are to be seen pretty numerously, and\r\nhe desires to draw attention to this promising tract. With reference to\r\nnumber eight, he says that \"taking all things into consideration this\r\ntract is one of the most promising I have seen.\" Of number nine he says,\r\n\"with regard to this gold-yielding locality, it is one of very great\r\npromise and worthy of all attention from mining capitalists,\" and as\r\nregards number ten, he reports that, though not so favourable as the two\r\nnumbers previously mentioned, it is yet deserving of the closest\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe west-central group was examined by Mr. Foote in the same order,\r\ni.e., from south to north, and he tells us that the auriferous\r\nlocalities in this group occur all in small detached strips or patches of\r\nschistose rock scattered over the older gneissic series. They are really,\r\nhe says, remnants of the once apparently continuous spread of schistose\r\n(Dharwar) rocks which covered great part of the southern half of the\r\nPeninsula. Mr. Foote examined in all fifteen localities, and they do not,\r\nfrom his account, seem to present appearances as favourable as those of\r\nthe central group, and he only recommends that attention should be paid to\r\nsix of them. As regards the first locality mentioned, he says that, though\r\nthe results from washings and other indications were not very favourable,\r\nthe field was deserving of further close prospecting, as the nature of the\r\ncountry is favourable. Of locality number five, he says that it contains a\r\nconsiderable number of large and well defined reefs, to which a great\r\namount of attention has been paid by the old native miners, and thinks\r\nthat they are deserving of the closest attention at the present time by\r\ndeep prospecting on an ample scale. Of number seven he finds it impossible\r\nto form any positive opinion, though he adds that the size of the old\r\nworkings show that the old miners found the place worth their attention\r\nfor a long period. He advises that number eleven should be prospected and\r\ntested. Locality thirteen he considers to deserve close prospecting, and\r\nhe makes much the same remark as to number fourteen.\r\n\r\nThe western group, Mr. Foote tells us, is far poorer in auriferous\r\nlocalities than either of the others, and they are scattered widely apart.\r\nHe examined in all seven localities. Of the first locality examined, he\r\nsays that the geological features are all favourable to the occurrence of\r\ngold, and that the locality is worthy of very careful prospecting. In\r\nlocality number two, such a good show of coarse grained gold was got from\r\nthe sands of a stream that he thought a portion of the land from which its\r\nwater came ought to be closely tested in order to trace the source of the\r\ngold found in the stream. When writing on locality number three, Mr. Foote\r\nobserves that the elevated tract of the auriferous rocks of which the\r\nBababudan mountains form the centre is one well deserving great attention\r\nboth from the geologist and the mining prospector, it being an area of\r\ngreat disturbance, the rocks being greatly contorted on a large scale and,\r\nthe north and south sides at least of the area, much cut up by great\r\nfaults. The whole of the auriferous areas here, he says, are deserving of\r\nclose survey, for even the best of them are very imperfectly known, and\r\nmuch of what was known to the old miners in former generations has been\r\nforgotten. \"From the fact,\" writes Mr. Foote, \"that in my hurried tour I\r\ncame upon no less than five sets of old workings that had not been brought\r\nunder the notice of Messrs. Lavelle and Marsh (reports of whose\r\ninvestigations are given in the \"Selections\"), I quite expect to hear that\r\nmany other old abandoned workings exist in wild and jungly tracts which\r\nbound in the hilly and mountainous parts of the country.\" In locality\r\nnumber five such fine shows of gold were obtained, and there was such a\r\ngood looking old mine, and quartz reefs of great size, that Mr. Foote\r\nconsidered the place deserving of \"very marked attention from earnest\r\nprospectors.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from what Mr. Foote has said, that there is much to be done\r\nin the way of exploring and testing the Mysore province for gold, and I\r\nhope that what I have written may be the means of attracting further\r\nattention to the subject.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his report Mr. Foote mentions the fact that \"a great dyke\r\nof beautiful porphyry traverses the hills east of the Karigatta temple\r\noverlooking Seringapatam. The porphyry, which is of warm brown or\r\nchocolate colour, includes many crystals of lighter coloured felspar, and\r\ndark crystals of hornblende. The stone would take a very high polish, and\r\nfor decorative purposes of high class, such as vases, panels and bases for\r\nbusts and tazzas, etc., it is unequalled in South India, and deserving of\r\nall attention. If well polished it fully equals many of the highly prized\r\nantique porphyries. The dyke is of great thickness and runs for fully a\r\nmile, so is practically inexhaustible. Blocks of very large size could be\r\nraised, and from the situation of the dyke on the side of two steep hills,\r\nit would be very easy to open up large quarries if needful.\" As this dyke\r\nis close to a railway it may be worthy of the attention of capitalists.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] Printed for the use of the Government, and kindly lent to me by the\r\nDewan of Mysore.\r\n\r\n[26] Mr. Bosworth-Smith, _vide_ p. 36 of his Report, says that, up to\r\n1889, only three finds of iron tools had been met with in the old native\r\nworkings.\r\n\r\n[27] In Mr. Hyde Clarke's paper entitled \"Gold in India,\" London,\r\nEffingham Wilson, Royal Exchange, 1881, it is stated that \"Dr. Burnell\r\nbrings direct proof as to the abundance of gold, by his successful\r\ndecipherment of a remarkable inscription in the Tanjore temple.

The\r\nhorse, as we have seen, was unable to comprehend the working and the\r\nmeaning of his master's acts; and, in the same way, we often see that man\r\nequally fails to comprehend the nature and effect of things around him.\r\nAnd thus it is, and for long has been, as regards the institution I am now\r\nabout to consider. People in general have ignorantly murmured at the\r\ninstitution of caste; and, having ever looked at it with highly-civilized\r\nspectacles, and having seen especially a number of the inconveniences it\r\nhas caused to the educated population of the towns, it has been argued\r\nthat caste is the curse of all India. But it seems to me that an\r\nattentive, unprejudiced examination tends to prove that in former times it\r\nwas exactly the reverse, and that at the present moment, as far as all the\r\nignorant rural population is concerned, it may be considered, with\r\nreference to the state of the people, as a valuable and useful\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nAnd here, at the outset, I wish it to be clearly understood that an\r\nimmense divergence has taken place between the town and country\r\npopulations of India. The former have advanced with rapid strides on the\r\npaths of enlightenment and progress, while the latter, it is hardly too\r\nmuch to say, have remained almost universally stationary. To argue,\r\ntherefore, from one to the other is not only impossible, but absurd; and\r\nit is merely a waste of time to point out, at any length, that what may be\r\nadmirably suited to one set of people may be a positive nuisance to\r\nanother. With reference, then, to this question of caste, instead of\r\ntreating India as a whole, I shall divide it into town and country\r\npopulations. In the first place, I shall treat of the effects of caste on\r\nthe country populations, amongst whom I have lived; and, in the second\r\nplace, I shall offer some considerations regarding the effects of the\r\ninstitution amongst the people of the towns.\r\n\r\nAnd, first of all, as to its effects on the rural population.\r\n\r\nIn these observations on caste I shall not commence with any attempt to\r\ntrace its origin, nor shall I endeavour to enumerate the countless forms\r\nit has assumed amongst the peoples of the great peninsula. My aim is to\r\ndirect the attention of the reader not to the dry bones of its history so\r\nmuch as to the living effects of the institution. It is certainly a matter\r\nof interest to know something of the peculiar customs of the various\r\ntribes and races; but it is to be regretted that people generally have\r\nrested content with information of that sort, and have seldom attempted to\r\ninvestigate those points which are, I conceive, mainly of use and\r\ninterest. What Indians may or may not do--what they may eat, what they may\r\ndrink, and what clothing they may put on--are not matters on which\r\ninquirers should bestow much time. The information most needed, and which\r\nhas not yet, or only in the most imperfect sense, been acquired, is as to\r\nwhat caste has done for good or evil. It shall be my endeavour to solve\r\nthat question; and I imagine the solution would be in a great measure\r\neffected if I could, in the first instance, answer the following\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n1. How far has caste acted as a moral restraint amongst the Indians\r\nthemselves?\r\n\r\n2. How far advantageously or the reverse in segregating them socially from\r\nthe conquerors who have overrun their country?\r\n\r\nOn the first of these points I may observe, without the slightest\r\nexaggeration, that very few of our countrymen indeed have had such\r\nopportunities as myself of forming a correct opinion; for very few\r\nEnglishmen have been so entirely dependent on a native population for\r\nsociety. For the first four or five years of my residence in\r\nManjarabad[31] there were only three Europeans besides myself, and we were\r\nall about twelve miles apart. The natural consequence was that the farmers\r\nof the country were my sole companions; and, as I joined in their sports\r\nand had some of them always about me, terms of intimacy sprang up which\r\nnever could have existed under any other circumstances. And further, when\r\nit is taken into consideration that I have employed the poorer of the\r\nbetter castes in various capacities on my estates, and a large number of\r\nthe Pariahs, or labourer caste, it seems pretty clear that I ought to be a\r\ntolerably competent judge as to whether caste did or did not exercise a\r\nfavourable influence on the morals of the people. Now, as regards one\r\ndepartment of morals, at least, I unhesitatingly affirm that it did, and\r\nthat, as regards the connection of the sexes, it would be difficult to\r\nfind in any part of the world a more moral people than the two higher\r\ncastes of Manjarabad, who form about one-half of the population, and who\r\nmay be termed the farming proprietors of the country. Amongst themselves,\r\nindeed, it was not to be wondered at that their morality was extremely\r\ngood, as, from the fact of nearly everyone being married at the age of\r\npuberty, and partly, perhaps, from the fact of their houses being more or\r\nless isolated, instead of being grouped in villages, the temptations to\r\nimmorality were necessarily slight. Their temptations, though, as regards\r\nthe Pariahs, who were, when I entered Manjarabad, merely hereditary serfs,\r\nwere considerable; and there it was that the value of caste law came in.\r\nCaste said, \"You shall not touch these women;\" and so strong was this law,\r\nthat I never knew of but one instance of one of the better classes\r\noffending with a Pariah woman.[32] Some aversion of race there might, no\r\ndoubt, have been, but the police of caste and its penalties were so strong\r\nthat he would be a bold man indeed who would venture to run any risk of\r\ndetection. To give an idea of how the punishment for an offence of this\r\nkind would operate, it may be added that, if one of the farming classes in\r\nthis country, on a case of seducing one of the lower, was fined by his\r\nneighbours £500, and cut by society till he paid the money, he would be in\r\nexactly the same position as a Manjarabad farmer would be who had violated\r\nthe important caste law under consideration. Here, therefore, we have a\r\nmoral police of tremendous power, and the very best proof we have of the\r\nregularity with which it has been enforced lies in the fact that the\r\nPariahs and the farmers are distinguished by a form and physiognomy almost\r\nas distinct as those existing between an Englishman and a negro. Caste,\r\nthen, as we have seen, protects the poor from the passions of the rich,\r\nand it equally protects the upper classes themselves, and enforcedly makes\r\nthem more moral than, judging from our experience in other quarters of the\r\nglobe, they would otherwise be.\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly glanced at caste law, as controlling the connection of\r\nthe sexes, let us now look at it from another point of view, which I\r\nventure to think is, as regards its ultimate consequences, of even still\r\nmore importance. If there is one vice more than another which is\r\nproductive of serious crime, it is the abuse of alcohol; and there is no\r\ndoubt that, to use the words of an eminent statesman, \"if we could\r\nsubtract from the ignorance, the poverty, the suffering, the sickness, and\r\nthe crime now witnessed among us, the ignorance, the poverty, the\r\nsickness, and the crime caused by the single vice of drinking, this\r\ncountry would be so changed for the better that we should hardly know it\r\nagain.\" Regarding it, then, in all its consequences, whether physical or\r\nmental (and how many madmen and idiots are there not bred by\r\ndrinking?[33]), it is difficult to estimate too highly the value of caste\r\nlaws that utterly prohibit the use of those strong drinks that are\r\ninjurious in any country, but are a thousand times more so under the rays\r\nof a tropical sun. And when we come to consider that a large proportion of\r\nthe population of India are absolutely compelled to abstain from the use\r\nof alcohol, and that these being the very best, or at least equal to the\r\nvery best, of the community, must always have exercised a large influence\r\nin discouraging the excessive use of intoxicating drinks, it is impossible\r\nto refrain from coming to the conclusion that this single fact is more\r\nthan sufficient to counterbalance all the evils that have ever been said\r\nto arise from caste.\r\n\r\nOn two very important points, then--the connection of the sexes and the\r\nuse of alcohol--it is evident that caste laws have produced some very\r\nfavourable and valuable results; but I do not think we can accurately\r\ngauge their value unless we compare the state of morality existing in\r\nManjarabad with the state of morality existing in one of our home\r\ncounties; and the comparison I have to make, if not very soothing, is, I\r\nam sure, very interesting. Take any one of our counties in Great Britain,\r\nfor instance, and compare it with Manjarabad as regards the points I have\r\nparticularly referred to, and it will be found that Manjarabad has an\r\nimmense superiority. The crimes and misery arising from drinking are\r\nhardly to be found at all in Manjarabad, while the morality of the sexes,\r\nI should think, could hardly be surpassed. Now, there is nothing very\r\nsurprising, considering that the people in this country are so heavily\r\nweighted, that this should be the case; on the contrary, it is the natural\r\nresult of the circumstances of their worldly situation. But, supposing\r\nthat the worldly situation as to the means of support and the\r\nopportunities of marrying were equal, it seems to me perfectly plain that\r\nthe people who have a large proportion of the better classes total\r\nabstainers, and who have their society so controlled that the rich cannot\r\ngratify their passions at the expense of the poor, must be in the\r\npossession of a superior morality.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this branch of the subject, I may allude briefly to what\r\nhas been so often attacked by the opponents of caste: I mean the\r\nprohibition of the marriage of widows. This rule exists in Manjarabad, but\r\nI am not aware that any great moral evil arises from it, as a widow can\r\nalways contract to live with a man, the difference being that the\r\nceremonies performed are of an inferior kind. This is not allowed to be a\r\nmarriage, but, in fact, it is a marriage, though of a kind held in rather\r\nlow estimation. On customs like these, which in a great measure neutralize\r\nthe evils arising from the restrictions on re-marriage, it seems to me\r\nthat our information is very scanty, and I am not aware how far the\r\npractice alluded to prevails in other parts of India.\r\n\r\nHaving taken into consideration the advantages of caste in acting as a\r\nmoral restraint amongst the Indians themselves, I now purpose to inquire\r\nhow far caste has acted advantageously, or the reverse, in segregating the\r\npeople socially from the conquerors who have overrun their country.\r\n\r\nIf the advantages of caste are striking and plainly apparent as regards\r\nthe moral points I have alluded to, they seem to me to be infinitely more\r\nso when we come to consider the happy influence this institution has had\r\nin segregating the Indians from the white races. And here I cannot help\r\nindulging in a vain regret that the blessings of caste have not been\r\nuniversally diffused amongst all inferior races. How many of these has our\r\nboasted civilization improved off the face of the earth? How much has that\r\ntide of civilization which the first conquerors invariably bring with them\r\neffected? How much, in other words, have their vice, rum, and gunpowder\r\nhelped to exterminate those unhappy races which, unprotected by caste,\r\nhave come in contact with the white man? Nor in India itself are we\r\naltogether without a well-marked instance of the value, for a time at\r\nleast, of an entire social separation between the dark and white races;\r\nand the Todas, the lords of the soil on the Nilgiri Hills, furnish us with\r\na lamentable example of what the absence of caste feeling is capable of\r\nproducing. We found them a simple pastoral race, and the early visitors to\r\nthe hills were struck with their inoffensive manners, and what was falsely\r\nconsidered to be their greatest advantage--freedom from caste\r\nassociations. But what is their condition now? One of drunkenness,\r\ndebauchery, and disease of the most fatal description. Had the\r\nmuch-reviled caste law been theirs, what a different result would have\r\nensued from their contact with Europeans! Caste would have saved them\r\nfrom alcohol, and their women from contamination: they would thus have\r\nmaintained their self-respect; and if, at first, separation brought no\r\nprogress nor shadow of change, it would have at least induced no evil, and\r\neducation and enlightenment would in time have modified these caste\r\ninstitutions, which, to a superficial observer, seem to be productive of\r\nnothing but evil.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that social contact with whites, without any barrier\r\nbetween them and the inferior races, is not, in a moral point of view, a\r\nvery desirable thing in any part of the world. But if there is a moral\r\nconsequence, we may also point to a mental one, which exercises an immense\r\ninfluence: I mean the overwhelming sense of inferiority which is so apt to\r\ndepress casteless races. I believe, then, for savages, or for people in a\r\nlow state of civilization, it is of the greatest importance that they\r\nshould have points of difference which may not only keep them socially\r\napart, but which may enable them to maintain some feeling of superiority\r\nwhen coming in contact with highly-civilized races. Nor is it necessary\r\nthat the feeling of superiority should be well founded. An imaginary\r\nsuperiority will, I believe, answer the purpose equally well. \"We don't\r\ntouch beef, nor would we touch food cooked by Englishmen or Pariahs,\" seem\r\nbut poor matters for self-congratulation. But if these considerations\r\nprevent a man from forming a poor opinion of himself, they should be\r\ncarefully cherished. On these points, at least, a feeling of superiority\r\nis sustained, and therefore the tendency to degradation is diminished. But\r\nif on all points the white man makes his superiority felt, the weaker\r\npeople speedily acquire a thorough contempt for themselves, and soon\r\nbecome careless of what they do, or of what becomes of them. Their mental\r\nspring becomes fatally depressed, and this circumstance has probably more\r\nto do with the deterioration and extinction of inferior races than most\r\npeople would be inclined to admit.[34] Nothing, then, I believe, chills\r\nthe soul and checks the progress of man so much as a hopeless sense of\r\ninferiority; and, had I time, I might turn the attention of the reader to\r\nthe universality of this law, and to the numerous instances that have been\r\ncollected to prove the depressing and injurious effects that even nature,\r\non a grand and overwhelming scale, seems to exercise on the mind and\r\nspirit of man--how it makes him timid, credulous, and superstitious, and\r\nproduces effects which retard his progress. But to advance further on this\r\npoint, however interesting it may be, would only tend to distract the\r\nattention of the reader from the subject with which we are mainly\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIf the remarks hitherto made are of any value, they undoubtedly tend to\r\nprove that all inferior races have a tendency, in the first instance, to\r\nadopt the vices rather than the virtues of the more civilized races they\r\nmay come in contact with. Assuming, then, as I think we have every right\r\nto do, that this statement is universally true, it is evident that the\r\nsocial separation maintained by caste has been of incalculable advantage.\r\nOn the other hand, however, a number of disadvantages have been indicated\r\nby various writers; but only one of them seems to me at all worthy of\r\nserious attention. It has been asserted that this segregation has impeded\r\nadvancement, that it has prevented the Indians learning as much from us as\r\nthey otherwise might, and that it has impeded the mainspring of all\r\nadvancement--education. Here, I apprehend, the argument against caste, as\r\nfar as rural populations are concerned, utterly fails, and, in a province\r\ncontiguous to my own, a most signal instance to the contrary can be\r\npointed to. Few people have more proudly segregated themselves than the\r\nCoorgs; nowhere is the chastity of women more jealously guarded; and yet\r\nthey were the first people in India who desired and petitioned for female\r\neducation. And how, then, can it be for one moment asserted that the\r\ntendency of caste is to check the progress of the people?\r\n\r\nHaving thus glanced at some of the effects of caste institutions as they\r\naffect the rural population, we will now consider caste as it affects the\r\npeople of the towns. Following, then, the same order, and directing our\r\nattention to the same points selected for consideration when treating of\r\nthe rural classes, let us ask how far caste has operated with the\r\ntownspeople as regards the connection of the sexes and the use of alcohol.\r\nAnd here we shall find that the subject may be dismissed in almost a\r\nsingle sentence; for caste laws, as regards these points, can never act as\r\na moral restraint, because the possibility of enforcing them cannot and\r\ndoes not exist. Nor need I waste time in proving that people in towns,\r\nwhether in India, or any other part of the world, may readily do things\r\nwhich could never escape the prying eyes of a country society.\r\n\r\nThen, as regards the segregation from foreigners, it is evident that we\r\nneed employ little time, for such of the town populations as have\r\nmaintained a fair state of morality amid the evils of large cities, are\r\nnot likely to be materially affected by the bad habits and customs of the\r\nwhite races; and as for those who have never led a steady life, it would\r\nnot much matter with whom they mixed. But caste not only brings with it no\r\ngood as far as the town population is concerned, but its continuance is\r\nfraught with a multitude of painful and vexatious evils, which meet us at\r\nevery turn, for it hampers the actions, and clogs those efforts at\r\nprogress which are the natural result of intellectual advancement. And\r\nhere I cannot do better than quote the words of a Parsee gentleman, whose\r\nunceasing efforts to aid the progress of India entitle him to be placed\r\nin the very highest rank of those who spend much time and labour to\r\nproduce effects which they can never live to see the fruits of. These\r\nremarks of his, which I am now about to quote, were made at the close of a\r\npaper on caste, which I read at a meeting of the East India Association,\r\nand are quoted from the report published in the journal of the\r\nAssociation. After fully granting that, in the condition of society\r\nexisting at the time the system of caste was established, it may have done\r\na great deal of good, Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji proceeded to remark on the way\r\nthe present system of caste interferes with progress among the higher\r\nclasses, and then gave several instances to illustrate his observation.\r\n\"The great struggle,\" he said, \"which is now going on in Bombay about the\r\nwidow-marriage question is an apt illustration of this; and, also, the\r\nfear of excommunication prevents a large body of natives from coming to\r\nthis country, and profiting by their visit. It is often said, 'educated\r\nHindoos ought not to care for this excommunication;' but those who say\r\nthat, little think what excommunication means. A man who is excommunicated\r\nmay not care for it for his own sake, but he has his family to consider.\r\nWhat is to be done with daughters? They cannot marry if their father is\r\nexcommunicated, and the result is, therefore, most serious to them. I knew\r\nof one instance of a native gentleman who, being excommunicated from his\r\ncaste for having visited England, had, on the death of his child, been put\r\nto the very painful necessity of having the body carried by his servant,\r\nwithout anyone accompanying him.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, I think, to furnish two better instances of the\r\nevils of caste to people desirous of shaking off in any way the habits of\r\ntheir forefathers; and a more melancholy picture than that of this\r\nunfortunate man setting out with his dead child without a single friend\r\nto accompany him it would indeed be difficult to find. Many other\r\nillustrations might, of course, be given; but enough has been said\r\nalready, and we may safely consider it as a settled question that, as far\r\nas the people of the towns are concerned, the sooner caste is abolished\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nI may here be permitted to remind the reader that we have considered the\r\neffects of caste, as regards the country population, in two very important\r\nparticulars: first of all, as to the morality of the sexes, which is\r\ncontrolled to such a large extent by caste law; and secondly, we have\r\nlooted at the effects of caste as controlling the use of alcohol, and\r\nconsequently limiting the crimes and evils that can in most countries be\r\ntraced to drinking. On both of these points we have compared an Indian\r\ncounty with any county in Great Britain, and saw reason to think that\r\nmorality, as regards the points under consideration, is better in\r\nManjarabad than in any British county. And, by facts which may be brought\r\nfrom many quarters of the globe, we have seen that it is a universal law\r\nthat inferior races have a tendency to adopt the vices rather than the\r\nvirtues of superior races, and that, therefore, caste laws which enjoin\r\nsocial separation are of the highest value. We have seen, too, the value\r\nof caste in keeping up feelings of superiority and self-respect. We have\r\nalso seen that these caste laws can exist without retarding the progress\r\nof the people, or their desire for education. And, finally, taking all\r\nthese points into consideration, we concluded that there were no\r\ndrawbacks, and many striking advantages, connected with caste as far as\r\nthe country populations are concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, we looked at the circumstances of the people of the\r\ntowns, inquired as to how caste has affected them for good or evil, and\r\ncame to the conclusion that not only does no good arise from caste, but\r\nthat it is plainly and unmistakably an unmitigated evil.\r\n\r\nKeeping these conclusions firmly in mind, let us now advance to the\r\nconsideration of a third question, which naturally arises out of those\r\nfacts which I assume to have been established.\r\n\r\nThat question is--How far has caste acted beneficially, or the reverse, in\r\nhelping to retard our interpretation of Christianity? Pursuing the same\r\norder as before, let us ask, in the first place, whether caste has, as\r\nregards the country populations, acted beneficially in this as well as in\r\nthe other points we have looked at. But, before attempting to answer this\r\nquestion, it may be as well to offer a few general remarks which tend to\r\nshow that, independently of any question of caste, it is hopeless to\r\nexpect that any ignorant and generally unenlightened race can possibly\r\nderive any benefit from adopting the formulas and dogmas of a pure faith.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this old and well-established truth, let us point to four of\r\nthe many instances which may be adduced as decisively confirming it--the\r\nhistory of Christianity in Europe, of Islam amongst the Indian Mahomedans,\r\nand the history of Christianity in Abyssinia and India. As to the first,\r\nto use the words of Buckle, \"after the new religion had received the\r\nhomage of the best part of Europe, it was found that nothing had really\r\nbeen effected.\" Superstition was merely turned from one channel into\r\nanother. The adoration of idols was succeeded by the adoration of saints,\r\nand for centuries after Christianity had become the established religion\r\nit entirely failed to produce its natural fruits, because ignorance\r\nimperatively demanded superstition in some shape or other. To some it may\r\nseem, at first sight, a curious circumstance that the same remarks may be\r\napplied to the history of Mahomedanism in India. The idols were broken and\r\nthe one God declared. But how long was it before the people, like the\r\nIsraelites of old, fell away from the grand central doctrine of\r\nMahomedanism--the unity of God? How long was it before the adoration of\r\nidols was followed by the adoration of saints? The exact coincidence,\r\nhowever, is no more striking than that given causes produce fixed results\r\nwith an Eastern as well as with a Western people. When we turn, thirdly,\r\nto Abyssinia, what do we find? How have the dogmas of Christianity fared\r\nthere? The Abyssinians did not rise to the level of the dogmas and\r\nprinciples of Christianity--that we all know. They simply reduced it to\r\ntheir own level. Look, lastly, at our native Christians in India. I\r\nbelieve it is quite certain that, in the general opinion of Englishmen,\r\nthey are, to say the least, very far from being the best class in India;\r\nin fact, I do not think it too much to say that most Europeans hold them\r\nto be about the worst class of people in India. I confess that I do not\r\nshare this opinion altogether. The fact probably is that, in consequence\r\nof their extreme ignorance and generally debased state, they are, in the\r\nrural districts, neither better nor worse than the classes from which they\r\nare principally drawn. In our cantonments, however, and especially in\r\nthose where European soldiery abounds, there is every probability of their\r\nbeing worse than the classes from which they have sprung; and I have\r\nlittle doubt that the low estimation in which the native Christians are\r\nheld is owing to the fact that our countrymen have generally come in\r\ncontact with the specimens that have been nurtured amidst the scum of our\r\nIndian towns. Were we to believe the assertions of our English\r\nmissionaries, very different conclusions would, of course, be arrived at;\r\nbut unless they can show that the lowest and most ignorant classes of\r\nnatives, who from their habits, and from having nothing to lose, are under\r\ngreat temptations, form an exception to all specimens of humanity in other\r\nquarters of the globe, I am afraid there can be little reason to doubt\r\nthat the opinions I have expressed are fairly correct. I doubt very much,\r\nin fact, from my intimate knowledge of the lower classes of natives--and\r\nit is from these, as I said before, that our converts are mainly\r\nderived--whether they are capable of comprehending our religion at all. Of\r\none thing I think we may be quite certain, and that is, that the moment\r\nthe missionary's back is turned, these people return to their devils in\r\nthe event of any danger or sickness arising. This might be arrived at\r\ndeductively with perfect accuracy, and arguing solely from our knowledge\r\nof humanity under certain conditions; but I may mention that in Ceylon\r\ninstances of people reverting to their devil-worship are common amongst\r\nthe native Christians, and instances might, no doubt, be soon collected in\r\nIndia, if anyone thought it worth the trouble. While alluding to\r\nmissionary assertions, I may mention that the credulity of these gentlemen\r\nseems only to be equalled by the credulity of the British public. If they\r\nwould only extend their belief in the goodness of natives a little\r\nfurther, one might be tempted to sympathize with this amiable weakness.\r\nBut the peculiar part of their statements lies in the fact that their\r\nconverts have got all the virtue and morality in India, while the\r\nrespectable classes of the community seem, by their account, to be very\r\nbadly off in these respects. The most curious instance, however, of\r\nmissionary credulity that I have met with is to be found in the evidence\r\nof Mr. Underhill, given before the Committee on Colonization (India) in\r\n1859. And it certainly is a surprising result of conversion to find that\r\nthe wives of the converts become not only more beautiful, but also more\r\nfertile, than their heathen sisters. Two heathen natives had been heard to\r\ntestify to these facts, and it is wonderful to observe the complacent air\r\nof satisfaction with which these statements are accepted by the witness,\r\nwho added that this difference evidently arises from the more chaste and\r\nregular modes of life in which they fall.[35]\r\n\r\nI have said that the native Christians are probably neither better nor\r\nworse than the lower classes from which they are drawn, and the painfully\r\ntruthful remarks given in the note below[36] seem to show that, whatever\r\nmay be the case now (and I believe that the low-class converts are\r\nsomewhat better than they were then), the converts to Christianity must\r\nhave been originally a very indifferent set of people. Christianity,\r\nhowever, if it did not make these classes much better, at any rate made\r\nthem no worse. When we turn, however, to the middle-class farmers, it is\r\nevident that to have converted them, unless that conversion had been\r\npreceded by enlightenment, and a more advanced civilization than they had\r\nhitherto enjoyed, would have inflicted on them an incalculable injury, by\r\ndepriving them of restraints which, as we have seen, are in some\r\nparticulars of immense importance. To become a Christian, the first thing\r\nrequired of a man is that he should give up caste, and deliver himself to\r\nthe sole guidance of his conscience; that he should give up a powerful and\r\neffective moral restraint; that he should abandon a position which carries\r\nwith it feelings of self-respect and superiority, and resign himself to\r\nthe degrading reflection that he may eat from the same platter and drink\r\nfrom the same vessel as the filthiest Pariah; and that this would be\r\ndegrading there can be little doubt. Were he an educated and enlightened\r\nman, he would be sustained by feelings which would raise him above the\r\ninfluence of such considerations. But, in the absence of enlightenment,\r\nsad would be his fate, and melancholy the deterioration that would\r\ninevitably ensue. The way in which that deterioration would take place,\r\nthe way in which he would become careless of what he did, or of what\r\nbecame of him, has been sufficiently indicated in the previous pages of\r\nthis chapter; and to give in detail the principal reasons against a change\r\nof faith which involved the abolition of caste, would only be to repeat\r\nwhat I have already said as to the effect of the institution in\r\ncontrolling the morality of the sexes and the use of alcohol. Not only,\r\nthen, I repeat, would a change of dogma be as unimproving and superficial\r\nas changes of that sort always are with unenlightened people, but a number\r\nof positive evils would follow from the necessary abandonment of the\r\nrestrictions of caste; and we may therefore conclude that, as regards the\r\nwhole population, the effect of caste in helping to prevent the adoption\r\nof our interpretation of Christianity is of incalculable advantage.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the town populations the case is widely different. We have\r\nseen that for them the practical advantages of caste can hardly be said to\r\nexist at all, and therefore a change of religion which involved its\r\nabolition would, as regards any part of the society, at least produce no\r\nevil. Here, at least, we are on safe ground. But this is not all. We see\r\nthat with the better classes education and enlightenment have borne their\r\nnatural fruit, and demanded a pure faith, which has already sprung up in\r\nthe shape of Deism. Enlightenment, then, will produce a pure faith, which\r\nwill in time react on society, and push it forward with accelerated speed.\r\nNow, it cannot be denied that caste laws do retard the free and unfettered\r\nadoption of a pure faith; and if we assume that a pure faith will in turn\r\nbecome a cause, or even an accelerator, of progress, then it is certain\r\nthat, as regards the peoples of the towns, caste, as retarding the\r\nadoption of the most advanced principles of religion, is an undoubted\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\nWe have now looked at the bearings of caste on three very important\r\npoints--its moral bearing amongst the Indians themselves, its effects in\r\nmaintaining a social separation between the white and dark races, and its\r\neffects in retarding the adoption of a religion which involves the entire\r\nabolition of caste laws. In the first place, we looked at the effects of\r\ncaste laws on the rural populations, and came to the conclusion that on\r\nall these points caste has operated, and continues to operate,\r\nadvantageously. In the second place, we looked at its effects on the\r\npeoples of the towns, and came to the conclusion that caste confers on\r\nthem no advantages, while it is often productive of serious evil.\r\n\r\nLet us now glance for one moment at the causes of the general outcry which\r\nyou everywhere hear against caste institutions, and at the same time\r\nsuggest the line of conduct that the people of the towns ought to adopt\r\nwith reference to this question.\r\n\r\nAnd here I need not occupy much space in indicating the causes of that\r\nabuse of caste which has always been so popular with my countrymen. In\r\nfact, if we admit the truth of the facts and arguments hitherto adduced,\r\nthese causes are so apparent that the reader must have already anticipated\r\nthe solution I have to give. Caste, as we have seen, is a serious evil to\r\nthe peoples of the towns. Now, it is amongst towns and cantonments that\r\nour principal experiences of this institution have been acquired, and the\r\neducated natives of the Indian capitals, feeling all the evils and\r\nexperiencing none of the advantages of caste, are naturally loud in its\r\ncondemnation. Hence the cry arising from all Europeans and a trifling\r\nsection of the Indians, that caste should be abolished from one end of\r\nIndia to the other. But how is it that no response comes from these\r\ncountry populations amongst whom I have lived? How is it that these\r\nshrewd-headed people[37] are so insensible to the evils of caste, and that\r\nyou never hear one word about it? The answer is extremely simple. They\r\nhave never felt these evils, because for them they do not exist. If they\r\nfelt the pressure of caste laws as do the people of the towns, the outcry\r\nwould be universal, and the institution speedily done away with. Need I\r\nadd that when the people of the country are as advanced as the people of\r\nthe towns, that then, and not till then, will the pressure, which is now\r\nconfined to the latter, be universally felt; that then, and not till then,\r\nwill this institution, being no longer suited to the requirements of the\r\nage, be universally discarded.\r\n\r\nLet us now say a few words as to the line of conduct that should be\r\nadopted, as regards caste, by those who are desirous of freeing themselves\r\nfrom the restrictions of that institution.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the opponents of caste should not weaken their case by\r\ntalking nonsense; and, in the second place, they should remember, above\r\nall things, that, to use a common saying, \"if you want a pig to go to\r\nDublin, the best thing you can do is to start him off on the way to Cork.\"\r\nI shall now enlarge a little on both of these recommendations.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate my first suggestion--and to this suggestion I shall again\r\nhave occasion to allude further on in this chapter--a few sentences may be\r\ndevoted to glancing at some of those remarkable conclusions which sound so\r\nwell in the observations one often hears when anything is said about\r\nIndia. The tendency of caste, you will hear it gravely urged, is to\r\nelevate the upper classes on the highest possible pinnacle, and keep the\r\nPariah grovelling in the dust. \"What,\" continues the speaker, \"keeps the\r\nBrahmin at the top and the Pariah at the bottom?\" Why, let me ask in turn,\r\nis a cow's tail long, and a fox's tail bushy? Is it in this nineteenth\r\ncentury that we are to try and din into people's ears that the upper\r\nclasses in India were at the top of the social scale, and the Pariah at\r\nthe bottom, centuries before caste, in its present shape, ever existed,\r\nand that the relative position of the two races would continue with little\r\nchange if caste was to be abolished to-morrow morning? \"What,\" gravely\r\nasks another, \"has prevented the peoples of India uniting into one grand\r\nnation, and destroyed all hopes of political fusion?\" Nor, to many, would\r\nthe absurdity of the question be apparent till you asked them what has\r\nprevented all Europe becoming one nation; or, to take things on a smaller\r\nscale, till you asked what prevented the Highland clans forming themselves\r\ninto a nation. In short, whenever a man is in difficulty, and at a loss to\r\naccount for anything connected with the state of the people of India, he\r\ntakes refuge in caste, combined, perhaps, with what is called native\r\nprejudice, though what that last means I do not pretend to explain. Now,\r\nit is not improbable that some of my readers may have heard of Holloway's\r\npills, and we know, in fact, that thousands believe that medicine to be an\r\nefficacious remedy for every constitutional ailment. Only swallow\r\nHolloway, and you are a cured man. Well, the abolition of caste, with an\r\nincredible number of people, is, in like manner, confidently pronounced to\r\nbe a universal remedy for all the political and social complaints of\r\nIndia. Remove that, and you will at one stroke secure social liberty,\r\nnational unity, the removal of idolatry, and, some even are rash enough to\r\naffirm, the universal adoption of Christianity. Such, then, are a few\r\nexamples of the nonsense you will hear commonly talked about caste, and I\r\nthink I need not waste time in pointing out that the opponents of caste\r\nmust take very different ground if they wish to obtain a hearing from the\r\npeoples of India.\r\n\r\nIn the second point to which I have called the attention of the reader I\r\nalluded to the general law of opposition, and used a common saying which\r\nexactly illustrates the probable result of violent and ill-judged attacks\r\non caste. In fact, so apparent is this, that the reader must have already\r\nanticipated the line that, in my opinion, the opponents of caste should\r\nfollow. What the opponents of caste should preach is, not the abolition\r\nof that institution, but toleration for the educated and advanced members\r\nof the community who, finding caste an impediment and a burden, wish to\r\ndiscard it. They should admit that this institution has been, and is at\r\nthe present moment, of value amongst the rural populations, but they\r\nshould, at the same time, point out that times are changing, and that the\r\npeoples of the towns ask for some toleration, not because caste is\r\nnecessarily a universal evil in itself, but because it is, as far as they\r\nare concerned, highly inconvenient. This is the way--and, if this plan\r\ndoes not answer, I feel sure no other will--that the evils of caste are to\r\nbe mitigated, and I urge these views accordingly on the serious attention\r\nof all enlightened Indians.\r\n\r\nThe reader will have observed that, when pointing out the advantages of\r\ncaste in repelling our interpretation of Christianity, I have assumed that\r\nthe adoption of Christianity necessarily involves the entire abolition of\r\nall those social distinctions that make up what we call caste. Such have\r\nbeen the terms on which Christianity has been offered to the peoples of\r\nIndia by our English missionaries; and I, for one, do most sincerely\r\nrejoice that their hide-bound interpretation of the Protestant faith has\r\nbeen as promptly as it has been decidedly rejected. But why should\r\ncaste--which, as I have shown, can be proved to have produced such\r\nfavourable results as regards drinking, and as regards the morality of the\r\nsexes--why should this institution, which in these respects can be proved\r\nto have produced better results than Christianity has over done in Great\r\nBritain--why should this be swept away because you wish to introduce the\r\nreligion of Christ? It has been alleged to be entirely incompatible with\r\nChristianity; and were this so, there would, of course, be no more to be\r\nsaid. But this I wholly deny. It is, of course, incompatible in some\r\nrespects with exalted conceptions of the most advanced Christianity; but\r\nthere is no reason why Christianity should not be allowed to exist\r\nalongside of abnormal social growths, and why, in short, Christianity\r\nshould not be stretched to tolerate caste, in the same way that it was\r\nallowed by the apostles to exist alongside of evils with which the\r\ninstitution of caste cannot, for iniquity or for general ill effects, be\r\nfor one moment compared. Christianity was not held by the apostles to be\r\nan impossibility because the professors of that faith bought and sold\r\nslaves; it was not held so by their descendants for hundreds of years; and\r\nwill those interpreters of Christianity whom we have sent to India venture\r\nto assert that the Americans had no right to the name of Christians until\r\nthe close of the late war? Slavery was driven out at length, or at least\r\nin a great measure driven out, by Christianity; but Christianity,\r\nremember, had first of all to be introduced; and taking into consideration\r\nthe acts of the apostles, the way in which they yielded to the customs and\r\nprejudices of their converts, and the resolution they came to \"not to\r\ntrouble those of the Gentiles who were turning to God,\" on what grounds do\r\nour missionaries rest their claim to debar from the advantages of\r\nChristianity those people who, wishing to retain their place in society,\r\ndesire to become Christians? This is not the first time that these\r\nquestions have been asked. They were asked at great length by Mr. Irving\r\nin his \"Theory and Practice of Caste.\" Hitherto they have been asked in\r\nvain; and owing to the indifference of people in this country, and to the\r\nslavish submission of the laity to the opinion of the missionaries, a\r\nsystem of attempting to propagate Christianity has been allowed to exist\r\nwhich has been of incalculable mischief. But I think we may even go\r\nfurther than this. I think it may be asserted that the line taken up, as\r\nregards caste, by our missionaries has acted more prejudicially to the\r\ninterests of Christianity than if we had deliberately dispatched\r\nemissaries to India with the view of preventing the people from adopting\r\nthe religion of Christ. These may seem harsh, and I have no doubt they\r\nwill prove to be unwelcome, expressions of opinion. They will hurt, and I\r\nam afraid will shock, the feelings of many a good and worthy man. I regret\r\nthat this should be so, but I cannot help it. In any case good must arise.\r\nIf I am right, as I firmly believe myself to be, the cause of\r\nenlightenment and Christianity will be advanced; and if I am wrong, and it\r\ncan be proved that the missionaries are right, they will have as great,\r\nand it may even be a greater claim to public support than they ever had\r\nbefore. But it must be clearly understood that, as an individual desirous\r\nof propagating truth, I have a right to demand an answer. If that answer\r\nis satisfactory, well and good. If it is not satisfactory, or if no answer\r\nbe supplied at all, I would then propose to ask the public here to\r\nconsider whether it would not be better to withhold all their\r\nsubscriptions from our English, or at least transfer them to such missions\r\nas will consent to attempt to propagate Christianity on the widest\r\npossible base.\r\n\r\nIn considering this important subject I shall, in the first place, glance\r\nat Bishop Heber's \"Letter on Caste;\" Bishop Wilson's \"Circular;\" the\r\n\"Report\" of the Madras Commissioners; and the \"Statement\" of the Tanjore\r\nGerman missionaries. This may seem a formidable list of documents to\r\ncommence with, but it is my intention to make only the most cursory\r\nallusion to each, as to consider these papers at any length would occupy\r\nfar too much space. Having thus stated the difference of opinions, as\r\nregards caste, between the Germans and the Protestant missionaries, I\r\nshall then proceed to inquire whether caste can or can not be traced to an\r\nidolatrous source; whether it was in any way necessarily wound up with\r\nreligion; and whether, further, it is at all necessary that, supposing it\r\nto have been at any time wound up with religion, there should therefore\r\nbe at the present day any necessary connection between the religions of\r\nthe peoples and their caste customs.\r\n\r\nIn Bishop Heber's \"Letter\" of March 21st, 1826, he says that, \"with regard\r\nto the distinctions of caste as yet maintained by professing Christians,\r\nit appears that they are manifested--(a) in desiring separate seats at\r\nchurch; (b) in going up at different times to receive the Holy\r\nCommunion; (c) in insisting on their children having different sides of\r\nthe school; (d) in refusing to eat, drink, or associate with those of a\r\ndifferent caste.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first of these points the bishop observes, with great justice, that\r\npoints of precedence have constantly been granted in Christian churches to\r\npeople of noble birth and of great fortune, and that in the United States\r\nof America these distinctions were always maintained between the whites\r\nand the negroes. He also points out that a Christian gentleman conforms to\r\nthose rules because, if he neglected them, he would lose influence with\r\nhis own degree in society, and that a native of the better classes acts\r\nexactly on the same principle. And on this point he concludes that\r\ndistinctions of caste in church may still be allowed, provided that due\r\ncare is taken to teach the natives that in the sight of God they are all\r\nequal.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the second point the good bishop says nothing, because,\r\nI surmise, he concluded the going up at different times to receive the\r\nSacrament was included in his remarks on precedence in church.\r\n\r\nAs regards the schools, and amongst the children, he observes that caste\r\nmust, as to taking places, etc., not be taken into account, \"but,\" he\r\nadds, \"even here caution should be observed to disgust no man needlessly.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the fourth point, he was decidedly of opinion that, as regards\r\nprivate meals and social intercourse, we had no right to interfere\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nAfter alluding to the objections raised by some zealous missionaries to\r\nthe processions in marriages and other matters, he intimates pretty\r\nplainly that he has some fears that recent missionaries have been more\r\nscrupulous in these matters than need requires. He then concludes by\r\nsaying that \"God forbid we should wink at sin; but God forbid, also, that\r\nwe should make the narrow gate of life narrower than Christ has made it,\r\nor deal less favourably with the prejudices of this people than St. Paul\r\nand the primitive church dealt with the almost similar prejudices of the\r\nJewish converts.\"\r\n\r\nThe bishop then framed a set of questions as regards caste observances, to\r\nwhich he required particular answers; but, in consequence of his untimely\r\ndeath, and of the short tenure of office held by his successors, Bishops\r\nJames and Turner, no further official action was taken till the middle of\r\n1833, when Bishop Wilson's \"Circular\"[38] dealt the most fatal blow to\r\nChristianity that it has ever received in India. For this \"Circular\"\r\nimperatively declared that the distinction of castes, as regards all the\r\nrelations of life, must be abandoned, \"decidedly, immediately, and\r\nfinally.\" And in order that this mandate might be intensely galling to the\r\nupper class vegetarian Christian, it was especially ordered that\r\n\"differences of food and dress\" were to be included in those overt acts\r\nwhich were to mark out for condemnation the Christian who still clung to\r\nthe habits of his fathers in these innocent and, as regards food,\r\nhealthful restrictions. To cling to these differences of food and dress,\r\nand to abstain from alcohol, was to cling to caste; and it was especially\r\nordered that the children of native Christians should not be admitted to\r\nthe Holy Communion without a full renunciation of all those social\r\ndifferences which might distinguish them from other members of the society\r\nin which they lived. This was quite sufficient. \"The 'Circular' was read\r\nin the churches of Tanjore. It was received by the native Christians with\r\ngreat displeasure, and they showed their views by seceding in a body.\"\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Report of the Madras Commissioners, which was written\r\nin 1845, we shall at once see the cause and root of this violent attack on\r\nsocial usages. For the Commissioners commence their Report by stating that\r\nthe institution of caste and the divisions of society were things of\r\npriestly invention, and that, in fact, the whole of Hindoo society, as we\r\nat present see it, originated in, and is maintained by, Hindoo idolatry.\r\nAnd they further allege that the tyranny of this institution is such as to\r\nbe perfectly unaccountable on any other supposition. How any body of\r\npriests had the power to issue and enforce mandates regarding the\r\nextraordinary diversities as to food and dress that we see prevailing\r\nthroughout India, where the council sat that issued these decrees, and\r\nwhere the members of this council came from, they give no account. They do\r\nnot seem to have even thought of such questions, and, for evidence of\r\nthese astounding assertions, they refer us to what they call \"the laws of\r\nManu,\"[39] and to Halhed's \"Gentoo Hindoo Code.\" Caste and idolatry,\r\nthen, according to them, are not only inextricably wound up together, but\r\ncaste itself was caused by, and is a part of, idolatry; and we are,\r\ntherefore, plainly told that it is impossible that a man should abandon\r\nthe one without abandoning the other, and that, in other words, the two\r\ninstitutions must stand or fall together. Leaving this part of these\r\nassertions to be commented on further on, I now pass on to the statement\r\nand arguments of the Tanjore German missionaries.\r\n\r\nShortly after Bishop Heber's \"Letter,\" which I have referred to at the\r\ncommencement of these remarks, he drew up a number of questions regarding\r\ncaste practices amongst native Christians, to which he required special\r\nanswers. These \"Articles of Inquiry,\" as they are termed, were sent to the\r\nTanjore missionaries, and by them a statement in reply was furnished. They\r\nwere asked for their opinion in 1828, and though no date is affixed to\r\nthese statements, I conclude that they probably replied towards the close\r\nof that year.\r\n\r\nThey commence by observing that the distinctions of caste had been\r\nobserved since the establishment of the mission by the Rev. Mr. Schwartz,\r\nsoon after the year 1762, and that he himself had been guided, partly by\r\nhis own discretion, and partly by the example of the clergy of the\r\nTranquebar Mission, which was started in the year 1705, by those good and\r\namiable men of whom I have given some account in another part of this\r\nwork. These successors of Schwartz, then, observed that they had\r\npersistently imitated the conduct of that able and good man; but that,\r\nwhile they took care to imitate his caution, and forbearance, they seized\r\nevery opportunity of softening the mutual prejudices arising from\r\ndistinctions of caste; and they also observe that, in consequence, those\r\ndistinctions of caste have gradually lost a great deal of their\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nAlluding, in the next place, to the assertion that castes had been\r\ninvented and entirely originated by the Brahmins, the authors of the\r\nstatement observe that, in the opinion of the most intelligent natives who\r\nwere not of the Brahminical order, the social distinctions which\r\nconstitute caste existed long before the Brahmins came into the country at\r\nall; and they assert, further, that though the Brahmin priests blended\r\nthose social distinctions with their idolatry, and framed a convenient\r\nlegend to account for their divine institution, the whole thing was a mere\r\nfiction, which had been invented with the view of adding to the power of\r\nan ambitious priesthood. But the missionaries of Tanjore asserted,\r\nfurther, that even if the legend of caste was a true one, and that caste\r\nhad been a part of idolatry, still those who abandoned the worshipping of\r\nidols and superstitious rites were not therefore to be required to abandon\r\nsuch practices as had nothing of idolatry about them at all, and they\r\ndistinctly declared that no rites of an idolatrous or even mixed nature\r\nwere tolerated amongst their converts.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries then pointed out that their high-caste converts simply\r\nretained these privileges and social customs because they would lose the\r\nrespect of their neighbours if they abandoned those marks of station which\r\nthey had inherited, and which they looked upon entirely as a civil\r\nprerogative. It was also pointed out that high-caste priests gained ready\r\naccess to the houses of the better classes, and had, therefore, bettor\r\nchances of spreading Christianity than Pariah priests, whom no good-caste\r\nnative would allow to cross the threshold of his house.\r\n\r\nAt church those of the upper classes sat on one side, and those of the\r\nlower on the other, and the higher and lower castes went up at different\r\ntimes to the communion-table.\r\n\r\nIn the schools no difficulty was experienced, and high and low caste\r\nchildren sat quite indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nAs regards social intercourse, they observe that none of their converts\r\nhave any objection to partake of food prepared by another caste, as long\r\nas that caste is of superior rank to them, but that no one would touch\r\nfood prepared by a man of lower caste than himself. The distinction of\r\ncaste was also preserved as regards marriages, though these, of course,\r\nwere always solemnized in the church.\r\n\r\nFinally, these good and sensible men regret the tendencies of caste, but\r\nseem to consider that more good was to be done by letting it alone, and,\r\nin short, letting it die a natural death, than by forcibly opposing the\r\nprejudices of the people. And they very justly observe, that to oblige a\r\nman of high caste to eat with the lowest is doing force to common delicacy\r\nand to natural feelings of sense, and may be sometimes of serious\r\nconsequence to bodily health.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that about thirty-five years ago, Dr. Graul, the head\r\nof the Leipsic Missionary Society, visited India, remained there three\r\nyears at the various missionary stations, and was firmly convinced that to\r\ninterfere with the social customs of the native Christians would be at\r\nonce unjust and impolitic. As regards the exact action of the Roman\r\nCatholics at present, I have no information to lay before the reader, but\r\nI know that they always had the wisdom to interfere as little as possible\r\nwith the prejudices of the people, as long as they did not involve\r\nidolatrous rites.\r\n\r\nHaving thus laid before the reader an outline of the views of the\r\nsupporters and opponents of caste, I shall now offer the conclusions I\r\nhave arrived at, partly from my own observations and partly from the\r\nwritings of others. I shall\r\n\r\n1. Inquire into the origin of caste.\r\n\r\n2. I shall inquire into the sanitary uses of caste, more especially as it\r\nconcerns the approaching the communion-table promiscuously, as to the\r\nsitting together in church or other places, and as to its effects as\r\nregards general social intercourse.\r\n\r\n3. I shall inquire whether there are not some compensating advantages, as\r\nregards caste institutions, which tend in a great measure to neutralize\r\nthe prejudicial effects that arise from people's sympathies and feelings\r\nbeing confined to the members of their own caste, instead of being evenly\r\ndistributed over the human race, considered as a whole.\r\n\r\nAnd, first of all, as to the origin of caste--a point which seems to have\r\nbeen thought of no little importance by our caste-condemning missionaries.\r\nI confess that I, for my part, do not attach much importance to this\r\nquestion of the origin of caste, and think it of far more importance to\r\nascertain its present bearing and effect. But, as many have raised the\r\nquestion, and asserted that caste had an idolatrous origin, and was the\r\ninvention of an idolatrous priesthood, it may be worth while to gather\r\ntogether such facts as we can lay our hands on regarding this somewhat\r\nobscure subject. And it seems to me that the first thing we have to do is\r\nto clear away the rubbish which has been piled upon it in common with\r\nmost Indian institutions--to ask what is evidence, and what is not. Our\r\nmissionaries have asserted that caste can be clearly traced to an\r\nidolatrous origin, and that the institution is entirely unaccountable on\r\nany other supposition, and they pointed to the Code of Manu in proof of\r\nthat assertion. But, on referring to Mrs. Manning's valuable work on\r\n\"Ancient and Mediæval India,\" we can find no evidence that caste\r\noriginated in any special way whatever. And we are told, on the authority\r\nof Mr. Muir, that the sacred books of the Hindoos contain no uniform or\r\nconsistent account of the origin of caste, and that the freest scope is\r\ngiven by the individual writers to fanciful and arbitrary conjecture. The\r\nstory that the castes issued from the mouth, arms, thighs, and feet of\r\nBrahma was simply an allegory, which, in the course of time, hardened into\r\na literal statement of fact. The Brahmins, of course, came out of the\r\nmouth of Brahma; and, considering that they were the authors and compilers\r\nof all the principal books relating to castes and customs, it would have\r\nbeen extremely odd if they had not exalted their own order, and indulged\r\nin a tone of Oriental exaggeration which was eminently calculated to\r\ndeceive, not perhaps, their successors, but the Englishmen who went to\r\nIndia. But the most curious thing is, that it never seems to have occurred\r\nto our missionaries to suspect that what they took as evidence of facts,\r\nand of a state of things really existing, was, in reality, only evidence\r\nof what an order or set of people could write, with the view of exalting\r\nthemselves, and depressing the rest of the society amongst which they\r\nlived. The Brahmins chose to assert that the castes were of divine origin.\r\nThey wrote that down and handed it on. We came to India, and finding these\r\nstatements ready to hand, have simply swallowed them down, and added them\r\nto the number of illusions existing as regards India. But the facts really\r\nare, that castes and orders of men sprang up, we don't exactly know how.\r\nBrahmin writers described the castes, or at least part of them, and, in\r\nthe course of time, the writings were said to have caused the castes,\r\ninstead of the castes having caused the writings.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be the facts as regards caste, we know that caste can\r\nexist without idolatry, and idolatry without caste; and that though the\r\nBrahmins, with their usual desire to incorporate everything in life with\r\nreligion, gathered caste into their garners, and endeavoured to increase\r\nand extend it, still there is fair evidence for asserting that these two\r\ninstitutions have no necessary connection, and that, as it was perfectly\r\npossible to wind them up together, so it is perfectly possible to unwind\r\nthem and produce again an entire separation. In a word, it is perfectly\r\npossible for a man to retain caste, not as believing it to be part of his\r\nnative idolatrous religion, but as believing it to be (what it really was\r\ntill the Brahmins seized hold of it and attached it to their faith) a\r\ncivil institution which had sprung up in remote times, and had been\r\ninherited by him, just as rank and station are inherited in this\r\ncountry.[40] And that caste can exist without religion, and alongside of a\r\nreligion as opposite to Brahminism as Christianity is, we have the most\r\nindisputable evidence supplied by the late Sir Emerson Tennent, in his\r\n\"History of Christianity in Ceylon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Caste,\" he wrote, \"as it exists at the present day amongst the Buddhists\r\nof Ceylon, is purely a social distinction, and entirely disconnected with\r\nany sanction or pretensions derivable from their system of religion. Nor\r\nis evidence wanting that, even at a comparatively modern period, such was\r\nequally its aspect amongst the natives throughout the continent of India,\r\nby whom caste was held not as a sacred, but as a secular discrimination of\r\nranks. The earliest notice of India by the Greek historians and\r\ngeographers enumerates the division of the people into Brahmins,\r\nKistrayas, Vaisyas, and Sûdras; but this was a classification which\r\napplied equally to the followers of Buddha\" (who preached that, in the\r\nsight of God, all men were equal) \"and of Brahma, nor were the members of\r\neither section held ineligible for the offices of the priesthood.\" And, in\r\nthe note below, the reader will find additional evidence which will show\r\nhim that caste in Ceylon, just as it originally was in India, can and does\r\nexist merely as a division of ranks, and that it need not at all be\r\nnecessarily connected with any idolatrous rites or worship.[41]\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown how caste did not originate, it may, perhaps, not be\r\naltogether superfluous if I hazard a few remarks as to the way in which it\r\ndid probably originate.\r\n\r\nThe common idea of caste is that it is simply a combination of troublesome\r\nand fanciful restrictions, imposed upon the various peoples of India by\r\nthose of the upper classes who desired to keep themselves above the\r\njostling of the crowd. But this institution (if that be a correct term for\r\nit) arose naturally and regularly out of the circumstances of the times,\r\nand where these circumstances no longer exist, it will as naturally\r\ndisappear; and that the last must happen we have seen from, the fact that\r\naltered circumstances have already caused the commencement of its removal\r\namongst the people of the towns. But the general circumstances which gave\r\nbirth to caste require a few words of explanation, and the following\r\nsolution seems not an unnatural one.\r\n\r\nWe know, as a certain fact, that peoples to whom we have given the names\r\nof Dravidians and Aryans entered India from the north and north-west;\r\nthat they increased and multiplied, overspread the whole of India, and\r\nreduced the aborigines to serfdom. We also know that these tribes from the\r\nnorth, who were, comparatively speaking, fair, very naturally regarded the\r\nblack, ugly, carrion-eating aborigines with disgust. Hence, naturally,\r\nmust have arisen the opinions as regards Pariahs which all the superior\r\ncastes hold to this day. Even to have food touched by people of such\r\nabominable habits must have been repulsive, and therefore the separation\r\ninto men of caste and men of no caste, or, in other words, into browns and\r\nblacks (for the word for caste means colour), followed as a matter of\r\ncourse. Caste, then, seems naturally to have arisen from the idea that to\r\nassociate in any way with people of bad habits and grovelling ideas is an\r\nintolerable degradation. The superior races, therefore must have\r\nconsidered it a matter of importance to retreat as far as possible from\r\nthe habits of the aborigines; and when we take into consideration the\r\ninfluence of religion, the natural ambition of the priestly classes, the\r\nsplitting up into sects, and the fondness of the Hindoo mind for subtle\r\ndistinctions, the rest easily follows. But, though numerous castes arose\r\namongst the invaders, the main line of demarcation, is still the original\r\none of race--between the races of the north and the aborigines whom they\r\nfound in possession of India. The base, then, of caste, we may rest\r\nassured, was simply the result of a people, or rather of peoples, wishing\r\nto keep themselves uncontaminated when coming in contact with a debased\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThis was exactly the case with the Jews. They were simply a very strongly\r\nguarded caste, with a number of regulations as to what they were and were\r\nnot to eat, and with rules which prohibited them intermarrying or\r\nassociating with peoples with whom they came in contact. Many of those\r\nrules may seem to us ridiculous and fanciful, but they were calculated to\r\nprevent the Jews from any chance of adopting the manners and customs of\r\nthe peoples around them; and the Indians, having had similar views,\r\nnaturally adopted similar means. Such then is a brief generalization of\r\nthe causes which led to caste laws, which were, no doubt, carried in some\r\ninstances to a ridiculous length, but which were founded in common sense,\r\nand were admirably adapted to carry into effect the opinions of the\r\nsuperior races.\r\n\r\nWe have now, in the second place, to consider caste with reference to the\r\napproach of native converts to the Lord's table, the sitting apart of the\r\nvarious castes in church, and the effects of caste as regards what is\r\ncalled social intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe whole difficulty of the caste question, as regards the Sacrament, lies\r\nin this, namely, that a high-caste vegetarian objects to drink wine at the\r\nsame time and after a low-caste meat-eater. And here I find a great\r\ndifficulty in finding words or illustrations that will at all convey the\r\nfeelings of a high-caste vegetarian at the very idea of drinking after a\r\nlow-caste carrion-eater. If from the lowest, filthiest, and most poisonous\r\ndens in London, you were to take a man, reeking with beer and tobacco, and\r\nwith his clothes crawling with vermin, and presenting, in short, every\r\nappearance of foulness, dirt, and disease; if you were to take that man\r\nand place him between two ladies at the administration of the Holy\r\nCommunion, I do not say that they would there and then refuse the\r\nSacrament on these terms, but I think we may be pretty sure that, from\r\nsanitary motives, if from no others, they would in future take the\r\nSacrament in a place where they would not be liable to such contact. Their\r\nfeelings and senses would be shocked by such contact as I have imagined,\r\nbut their sensations would merely bear the same proportion to the\r\nsensations of a high-caste vegetarian Hindoo who had to drink after a\r\nPariah that a trifling cause of disgust would bear to the most intolerable\r\nand lasting degradation. Now, to people in this country, this may seem an\r\nextraordinary thing; but they will think it less extraordinary when I tell\r\nthem that, if I could not take the Sacrament unless amongst Pariahs, I\r\nwould never take it again, unless perhaps, I were to put myself bodily\r\ninto one of Professor Tyndall's cotton-gauze air-cleansers, and drink the\r\nsacramental wine after it had been boiled at a temperature of 212 degrees,\r\nand passed through a filter. And when I talk of the lowest castes as\r\ncarrion-eaters, I must tell the reader that I am not in the slightest\r\ndegree guilty of exaggeration, and that they are carrion-eaters in exactly\r\nthe same sense that vultures are carrion-eaters. In fact, these men never\r\nget any meat unless that of animals that have died of disease; and as in\r\nthese climates decomposition is extremely rapid, the reader can imagine\r\nthe result of coming in contact with a man who has, perhaps, a few hours\r\nbefore been eating a mass of diseased and half decomposed meat. And in\r\ncase the reader should not be able to imagine what the result is, I may\r\nmention the following circumstance. A few days after I had killed a bison\r\nI had occasion to point out some pieces of sawn wood which I wished to be\r\nremoved from the jungle to my house, and I accordingly took with me a\r\nnative overseer, and two coolies to carry the timber. When I was pointing\r\nout the pieces to them, I smelt a strong smell of putrid meat, which\r\nseemed to fill the air so entirely that I at once concluded that a tiger\r\nmust have killed some animal and left the carcase near the spot. My\r\noverseer and myself looked about everywhere, but at last happening to pass\r\nthe coolies, I at once perceived that the smell arose from their breath,\r\nand on questioning them, I found that before coming to work they had been\r\nfeasting on decayed bison flesh. In fact, after killing a bison, we could\r\nnever go near our coolies for some days afterwards. But to see a party of\r\nthese men sitting like vultures around the carcase of some animal that has\r\njust died of some abominable disease is quite enough to inspire even an\r\nunprejudiced European meat-eater-with the most wholesome horror; and the\r\nreader need not, I think, be surprised at the feelings of disgust which\r\nthese men's habits inspire amongst the respectable classes of the\r\ncommunity. But independently of all feelings of disgust, there are\r\nsanitary considerations which are of infinitely more importance, for it so\r\nhappens that, at a time when the weather is hottest and the season most\r\nunhealthy, a larger number of animals die; and I have very little doubt\r\nthat this eating of rotten meat causes amongst the Pariahs a large\r\nquantity of disease, and especially of cholera, which they would not fail\r\nto disseminate with fatal certainty amongst all classes, were the native\r\nChristians compelled to take the Sacrament indiscriminately. And, in my\r\nown experience, I have observed that cholera has passed through districts,\r\nthat the upper classes have been free from it, but that amongst the lower\r\nthe victims were many. And the same sanitary reasons that apply to the\r\nSacrament apply equally well to the mixing of castes indiscriminately in\r\nthe churches; for it might so happen, as it frequently does, that fever\r\nand cholera may be prevalent amongst the lower castes, while the higher\r\nmay be at that time comparatively free from such diseases. So that, when\r\nwe take all these points into consideration, we shall find that the German\r\nmissionaries were perfectly right in placing the men of the higher caste\r\non one side of the church, and those of the lower on the other, and that\r\nthey were equally right in allowing the higher castes to approach the\r\nSacrament at a different time from the lower. I may here remark that I\r\nonce mentioned this taking of the Sacrament in a sort of order of\r\nprecedence to a clergyman in a country parish, when he told me that\r\nexactly the same sort of thing occurred in his parish, and that the lord\r\nof the manor invariably took the Sacrament first, and, if I recollect\r\nrightly, the parish clerk last; and a special instance of this in a Scotch\r\nparish was mentioned to me not long ago.\r\n\r\nThe same sanitary considerations will also naturally be of value when we\r\ncome to consider that indiscriminate social intercourse which the\r\nmissionaries so much insist upon as one of the necessary signs of grace. I\r\ndo not, of course, say that it is not advisable, and that it would not be\r\ndesirable to see a little more intercourse between class and class than\r\nexists at the present. But between all the better classes there is a much\r\ngreater degree of intercourse than our missionaries would have us believe;\r\nand it is not true that one caste will eat only the food prepared by a\r\nperson of his own caste. I cannot, of course, say what may be the case as\r\nregards other parts of India; but, as regards my own district, each caste\r\nwill eat of the food prepared by any of the castes higher, or at least\r\npurer, than its own. For instance, a Gouda, who will not allow that the\r\nLingayet caste is better than his own, will eat of food prepared by a\r\nLingayet, while a Lingayet will not eat of food prepared by a Gouda. And\r\nthe explanation of this is, that the Lingayet is a vegetarian, and meat\r\nmight have been boiled in the Gouda's pots, while there would be nothing\r\nto offend the Gouda customs in the pots of a vegetarian host. But in these\r\nmatters I entirely agree with the good Bishop Heber, who said that we had\r\nno right to interfere in their private life, or to meddle in any way with\r\ntheir social customs, as long as there was no idolatry in them.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the third point I proposed to consider, I have a few\r\nremarks to make regarding the only (from a Christian point of view) solid\r\nobjection that can, I conceive, be made to the institution of separate\r\norders of men; namely, that the tendency of caste is to shut up the\r\nbowels of compassion towards all the world outside of a man's particular\r\nclass. And here I confess that I am very much in want of information, and\r\ncan think of no unprejudiced individuals to whom to apply for the facts as\r\nreally existing in other parts of India. As for books, when I look into\r\nthem for any information, I am at once met by quantities of unlimited\r\ncondemnations, or a host of contradictory statements. And, as an instance\r\nof the latter, I may mention that in Kerr's \"Domestic Life of the Natives\r\nof India\" we are informed, at page 31, that \"alms are given to the poor\r\nwithout distinction of caste,\" while at page 343 of the same volume we are\r\ntold that \"to extend kindness and hospitality to one of a different caste\r\nis regarded as sinful.\" But in matters of this sort we want the experience\r\nof individuals who have actually lived amongst the people, as much as\r\nanyone can who is not actually one of them. As for my own part of the\r\ncountry, I can answer for it that caste has no such effect as has been\r\nalleged to arise from it regarding the extension of hospitality and\r\nkindness to people of various castes; and, as a confirmatory illustration,\r\nmay mention that I have found members of every caste assembled at the\r\nhouse of a toddy man to inquire how he was, and to see whether they could\r\ndo anything for him. These toddy-drawers rank at least third amongst the\r\ncastes in Manjarabad, and though none of the members of the farmer castes\r\nabove them would eat of food prepared in a toddy-drawer's house, yet there\r\nwere numbers of both these castes present. This feeling would not, that I\r\nam aware of, go as far as one of the carrion-eating Pariahs, but I am\r\nquite certain that it would extend to any other caste but theirs in the\r\ncountry. But on this point I do not offer any decided opinion, as, for\r\nwhat I know to the contrary, acts of kindness and hospitality may, no\r\ndoubt, often have been extended even to the lowest. And I may also\r\nmention here that I have slept in the veranda of a farmer's house, in\r\nwhich members of the family slept close to some of my people, who were of\r\nthe toddy-drawer caste above alluded to, and who, I am sure, were quite as\r\nwelcome as members of their own caste would have been. But as regards all\r\nthese matters concerning the inner life of the people, we know nothing,\r\nunless we actually live amongst them, and sleep in their houses, and, in\r\nfact, see the people at home; and as it is extremely difficult to find\r\nanyone who has done anything of the kind, it naturally follows that it is\r\nalmost impossible to find anything like reliable sources of information\r\nregarding native habits throughout India. You may, it is true, stuff your\r\nvery soul with information of some sort or other, if you go about asking\r\nquestions, but if you do you will find yourself much in the same\r\npredicament that Johnson found himself in his tour to the Hebrides; and\r\nthe reader may recollect that the worthy doctor very soon found that\r\nnothing could be more vague, unsatisfactory, and uncertain than the\r\nanswers of an unsophisticated simple people, who were not much in the\r\nhabit of being asked questions of any sort. However, the reader may, in\r\nthe meantime, reasonably infer that the conduct of the people in the rural\r\ndistricts of India, and situated under similar circumstances, would not\r\nmaterially differ, as regards matters of caste, from the practice as\r\nexisting in Manjarabad. And should that turn out to be the case, it is\r\nplain that those notions, as regards the practice of caste, which have\r\nbeen so industriously circulated in England, are almost entirely false.\r\n\r\nI have said that I proposed inquiring, further, whether there are not some\r\ncompensating advantages in this division of the people into castes which\r\ntend, in a great measure, to neutralize the prejudicial effects that arise\r\nfrom people's sympathies and feelings being more or less confined to\r\nmembers of their own caste, instead of being distributed over the human\r\nrace considered as a whole. Now, it is perfectly true that the tendency of\r\ncaste is to weaken the claim that humanity in general has on an\r\nindividual; but though the claim of society in general is weakened, it\r\nmust be remembered that the claims of each caste on the members of it are\r\nstrengthened. And though this fact may militate against an enlarged and\r\nChristian philanthropy, the aggregate force of claims will be found to\r\namount to a much larger sum than if one part of a society had no more\r\nclaim on a man than another. A man of one caste would not, for instance,\r\nperhaps feel that a man of another caste had much claim on him; but he\r\nwould distinctly and strongly feel that a member of his own caste had. And\r\nevery caste acting on the same principle of supporting and helping its\r\nmembers, I am convinced that the aggregate force of assistance rendered\r\nmust be greater than in a country where there is little or no caste\r\nprinciple. This may seem a rash assertion, and of course it is one that it\r\nis impossible, as far as I am aware, to prove. But the fact that there is\r\nnot a poor-house from one end of India to the other, seems to me a\r\nsignificant and satisfactory circumstance; and the only way I can account\r\nfor there being no need of such a thing is,[42] that caste feeling must\r\noften come in where all other aids fail. Nor are we in this country\r\nwithout instances of the value of caste feelings, and both the Jews and\r\nthe Scotch may still be pointed to as illustrations of what I mean. A\r\nScotchman still has a sort of caste feeling for a Scotchman, and would do\r\nthings for a man, as a Scotchman, that he would not do for people of\r\neither English or Irish descent. This principle may now have lessened, and\r\nis, no doubt, daily lessening. But when I started in India, I very soon\r\nexperienced the benefit of this caste feeling; and, as one illustration to\r\nthe point, I may mention that, before my estates came into bearing, I was\r\nattended in a long and serious illness by two Scotch doctors (one of whom\r\nattended on me for six weeks incessantly), both of whom resolutely\r\ndeclined any remuneration whatever. I cannot, of course, positively assert\r\nthat these gentlemen would not have attended me on the same terms had I\r\nbeen an Englishman, but, from my general experience with other doctors, I\r\nam sure that these gentlemen must have been not a little influenced by\r\ncaste feeling. And I have no doubt whatever that the way the Scotch get\r\non, wherever they go, is to be attributed, in no small measure, to the\r\nexistence of the same feeling. It may seem to many of my readers that to\r\nuse the term caste as a principle which impels one Scotchman to help\r\nanother is not exactly correct; and I must admit to having some doubts on\r\nthe subject myself. The case of the Jews, however, admits of none; and, if\r\never there was a caste of people in the world, in the strict Hindoo sense,\r\nthey are certainly an unmistakable example. And what are the results of\r\ncaste feeling with them? As to other parts of the world I have no precise\r\ninformation; but in England I have ascertained from the best authority\r\nthat caste feeling has produced some extremely favourable results. In the\r\nfirst place, Jews are seldom or never found in our workhouses; and all\r\ncases of poverty are carefully investigated by a visiting committee, or\r\nboard of guardians, and relief or employment is always afforded to every\r\nJewish pauper. Then, again, no Jewish child ever was, and no Jewish child\r\nis now, without the means of obtaining elementary instruction; and it\r\nwould be difficult to find an English Jew unable to read and write. Means\r\nare taken to secure the attendance of all poor children, and a sound\r\nmiddle-class education is afforded, while the study of the Hebrew language\r\nis compulsory. There were only, when I obtained my information on the\r\npoint, about twenty Jewish (principally foreigners) convicts in England,\r\nand no female convict was to be found.\r\n\r\nAnother of the principal complaints brought against caste is the fact that\r\nit has a tendency to keep one caste fixed below another; but even here we\r\nshall find some compensating considerations which are of great value. For,\r\nif caste in this respect has a keeping-down tendency, it has also a\r\nlevelling one. It may keep one order above another, but within the limits\r\nof that caste order it has a levelling tendency, and in one respect the\r\npoorest of each class feel themselves on a level with the richest. Nor is\r\na poor man of good caste made to experience the bitter sense of\r\ndegradation which falls to the lot of a gentleman who, from poverty and\r\nmisfortune, has fallen out of his original class into another far below\r\nhim. The Indian may descend into the most humble spheres, but if he\r\nattends to the regulations of his caste he is always a member of it, and\r\nhis feelings of self-respect are maintained by the fact that, however\r\npoor, it is quite possible that his daughter may be married by a man of\r\nwealth and position. But in this country, where a man has gone a long way\r\ndown the hill, when he has descended--as many gentlemen especially do in\r\nour colonies--into the lower ranks of life, he loses all connection with\r\npeople who are of his own rank by birth. I do not, of course, mean to\r\nallege that this want of caste feeling is to be lamented with us, but I am\r\nmerely stating facts which seem to me to show the number of ways in which\r\nthis much-reviled caste system can be proved to have compensating\r\nadvantages which tend to counterbalance the drawbacks of the situation.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter, it may be useful to make a few remarks as\r\nto the way in which caste laws act as regards the social condition of\r\npeople who have by wealth raised themselves above the general average of\r\ntheir order; and I shall at the same time notice a few instances that\r\nhave fallen within my observation as to the way in which caste laws of\r\nthe most stringent nature are occasionally set aside by universal consent.\r\n\r\nThe old idea we entertained of caste was that, to use the words of\r\nTennent, \"each class is stationed between certain walls of separation,\r\nwhich are impassable by the purest virtue or the most conspicuous merit;\"\r\nor that, to come to more recent times, and to use the words of the late\r\nMr. Wilson, in his speech before leaving for India, \"in India you see\r\npeople tied down by caste, and, whatever their talents or exertions may\r\nbe, they cannot rise.\" Now the history of many families that have risen to\r\neminence entirely belies this assertion, and the evidences are so numerous\r\nthat I need not weary the reader by quoting them. But one instance I may\r\nperhaps mention, as the circumstances seem to me somewhat extraordinary,\r\nand a reference to them here may induce some one to make more particular\r\ninquiries in the locality alluded to. Buchanan notices that \"in Bhagulpore\r\nthere were certain families who, from having adopted a pure life, had\r\nwithin the memory of man risen from the lowest dregs of the people to the\r\nhighest ranks of the nobility.\" In this instance, however, I cannot help\r\nsuspecting that the families must have risen on something more substantial\r\nthan their pure habits. But in matters of this sort we are very much in\r\nwant (as indeed we are on almost every Indian subject) of more detailed\r\nand particularly substantiated evidence. As regards the subject of low\r\ncastes raising themselves in the social scale, I know of no instances that\r\nhave fallen within my own observation, but I have obtained information\r\nfrom other parts of Mysore, the truth of which I have no reason to doubt,\r\nalthough I would advise the reader to receive what I have to say on this\r\npoint with the same caution that he should receive all information which\r\nis even in the smallest degree removed from the experience of personal\r\nobservation. With this caution, I may then observe that, from information\r\nI have received, I have ample reason to believe that in the interior of\r\nMysore there are many families of Pariahs who are as well off, in point of\r\ncattle, cash and land, as the average of the farmer caste, notwithstanding\r\nthat the forefathers of these Pariahs were merely the servants of the\r\nfarmer tribe. Nor is this all. Many instances, I believe, may be pointed\r\nout of members of the farmer tribe being the tenants of the once-despised\r\nPariah. The Pariah, it is true, does not reap all the advantages from his\r\naltered circumstances that might be expected in other countries, but it is\r\na mistake to suppose that wealth does not tell in India as it does\r\nelsewhere.[43] The well-to-do Pariah (and in the Nuggur division of Mysore\r\nI am told there are many such) receives that respect which is invariably\r\npaid to those who have much substance. He no longer stands respectfully\r\nwithout the veranda of a farmer of ordinary position, but takes his seat\r\nin the veranda itself, and on terms of perfect equality. But the farmer\r\nwill not eat with his visitor, nor give him his daughter in marriage. This\r\nto us would be a disagreeable reflection, no doubt; but, in their present\r\npolitical state, I cannot see that the happiness or prosperity of the\r\npeople is in any way affected by these facts, nor am I aware that any one\r\nhas attempted to prove that the natural comforts of the people have been\r\nin any way lessened by these social separations.\r\n\r\nTurning now to glance at the way in which caste laws are sometimes set\r\naside, it is impossible to avoid suspecting that the instances given of\r\ncaste feeling in these respects, though perhaps true in themselves, are\r\nnot fair examples of what would universally occur in cases of emergency\r\neven with the most caste-observing people in India. From the instances\r\ngiven (and those most commonly given refer to natives preferring to die of\r\nthirst rather than take water from the hands of a person of inferior\r\ncaste), people are led to believe that under no circumstances will a\r\nbreach of caste take place, or be overlooked if it does take place, by\r\nmembers of the caste. But the illustration I have to give seem to point to\r\na contrary conclusion, and if that is the case with people whom I know to\r\nbe extremely strict, it seems very probable that we have adopted some very\r\nexaggerated notions as to the rigidity of caste laws. And what has\r\ncontributed not a little to these delusions is, that tricky servants\r\nfrequently make caste a most convenient pretence for avoiding to do this\r\nor that, or as an excuse wherever an excuse is for any purpose convenient.\r\nBut however all this may be, the reader may form his opinions from the\r\nfollowing cases.\r\n\r\nThe first I have to give of violation of caste law is certainly the most\r\nextraordinary that I ever heard of. The act was, indeed, a remarkable and\r\ntouching tribute of regard, or I may even say of affection, on the part of\r\na native overseer of the farmer caste in Manjarabad, and was a better\r\nmonument than any that could have been erected to one of the best and most\r\nunselfish men I have over met. When Mr. W----, my late manager, unhappily\r\ndied on the estate, this overseer in question, understanding that it was\r\nconsidered by us as an honour to the deceased, volunteered to make one of\r\nthe carrying party. This extraordinary determination was absolutely\r\nforbidden by the caste potail, or head man, who was present; but Rama\r\nGouda[44] showed the same coolness and resolution that he always did in\r\nthe case of a bear or a tiger, and simply saying, \"Let my caste go\r\nto-day,\" he made one of the carrying party in spite of every remonstrance.\r\nHundreds of all castes were present, but so strong were their feelings of\r\nregard for Mr. W----, that no notice whatever was taken of the offence\r\nwhich was so publicly committed. The repugnance of all castes, except the\r\nvery lowest, to touching the body of a European, is very well known to\r\neveryone who has been in India, and so fearful was the caste head man of\r\nsanctioning, even with his presence, this violation of caste law, that he\r\nimmediately went home.\r\n\r\nIn the next instance I have to give, one of the Lingayet caste\r\n(vegetarians, and abstainers from intoxicating drinks) was wounded by a\r\ntiger, and there was a caste question raised, as to whether, under the\r\ncircumstances, he should take wine. The occurrence came about in this way.\r\nSome miles from my house I once wounded a tiger, somewhat late in the day,\r\nand, owing to the broken nature of the ground, and a general confusion\r\nthat seemed to take possession of the people, it seemed impossible to\r\nbring the affair to a satisfactory conclusion, so I went home. The\r\nfollowing morning I returned to take up the track of the tiger, but it was\r\nunluckily reported that the animal had quitted the jungle we had left him\r\nin, so the party (I having been posted at a point where the tiger would\r\nprobably break cover, in case the report should prove false), it appears,\r\nblundered carelessly into the place where the animal had been last seen\r\nthe evening before. Now, this particular spot was full of a long sort of\r\nreed that grows in swampy ground, so that the people could not see far\r\nbefore them, and, to make a long story short, it seems that the tiger\r\nbided his time, sprang suddenly into the party, and gave one of them a\r\nfatal bite in the loins. The moment I heard the three roars, I expected\r\nthat something disagreeable must have occurred, and, on arrival at the\r\nscene of events, I found a fine young fellow of the Lingayet caste lying\r\nbathed in blood, and my people vainly endeavouring to stanch the wounds.\r\nHe was half swooning away from loss of blood, and I offered him some wine\r\nto keep up his strength. This, however, he refused to take, unless the\r\nhead man of his village, who happened to be present, would consent. The\r\nhead man, evidently wishing to shirk the responsibility, shook his head\r\ndoubtfully; but the members of his caste all called out--\"It's no matter;\r\nlet him drink;\" and he drank accordingly. While this was going on, I had a\r\nrough stretcher made, and, doing up his wounds as well as we could, sent\r\nhim off on the way to his village. While we were attending to the wounded\r\nman, rather an amusing incident occurred. It appears that when the tiger\r\ncharged, one of the party, a toddy-drawer, at once climbed up a tree, and\r\nwhen the party retreated, carrying off the wounded, he was afraid to come\r\ndown. His absence had not been remarked, and when we were engaged in doing\r\nup the wounded man, the toddyman, who had taken heart and come down, slunk\r\nquietly out of the jungle, and startled some of the party not a little, as\r\nthey thought that it was perhaps the tiger coming down on them again.\r\nHowever, this toddyman reported that the tiger was still almost in the\r\nsame spot where he had been lying when he made his attack: and I then\r\nproposed we should go into the jungle, and see how we liked the look of\r\nhim. But the tiger had given such indications of temper that the main body\r\nof the people seemed to have no desire to see him again, and I think that\r\nonly ten (and those mostly my own people) accompanied me. As I was,\r\nEuropeanly speaking, single-handed, this may have seemed an imprudent\r\ncourse, and no doubt it was not altogether unattended with danger; but it\r\nluckily turned out that the tiger was stone dead, though he was lying in\r\nsuch a natural position that we had some doubts as to whether he might\r\nnot be shamming, even when we got within fifteen yards of him. As we were\r\nskinning the tiger, the wounded man (who had by that time only been\r\ncarried a few hundred yards) expired: so, observing that it was \"written\r\non his forehead,\"[45] we took up our man and our skin, and went home.\r\n\r\nThese instances of infringement of caste rules will show the reader the\r\nway in which they are sometimes abandoned; and I could mention other minor\r\npoints where I have seen them occasionally abandoned. But not only are\r\nthese rules thus, on urgent occasions, summarily set aside, but within a\r\nvery short distance I have observed an alteration of custom. For instance,\r\non our side of the river which separates our county from the next, neither\r\nthe farmers nor the toddy-drawers will eat of an animal that has even been\r\ntouched after death by a Pariah; whereas, on the other side of the river,\r\nthe Pariahs who came out shooting not only touched, but carried a couple\r\nof wild boars we had killed. And yet the people on one side of the river\r\nare exactly of the same caste as those on the other. But the fact seems to\r\nbe, that many of the minor points of what is called caste law have arisen\r\nfrom some accident, and in the course of time have hardened into local\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\nAnd here, before bringing this chapter to a close, I find it impossible to\r\nrefrain from again alluding to the numerous instances where caste has been\r\nmade the common scapegoat of every Indian difficulty. What is the meaning\r\nof this? What is the meaning of that? Why won't the natives do this, and\r\nwhy won't they do that? Caste--and caste is the common refuge; and with\r\nmost of our countrymen who have tried to introduce new customs or a new\r\nreligion, caste has ever been a handy and convenient peg on which to hang\r\nany difficulties they may meet with, or any problem they cannot readily\r\nsolve. In short, it is hard to say what difficulty has not been disposed\r\nof in this fashion. Let us glance at two instances to illustrate my\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nFor the first instance, I cannot select, perhaps, a better example than\r\nthat afforded by the Rev. G. U. Pope, in the notes he has made when\r\nediting a second edition of the valuable work of the Abbé Dubois. And, in\r\nalluding to these footnotes, it is impossible to repress some feeling of\r\nannoyance that the valuable work of the Abbé should, in an evil hour, have\r\nfallen into the hands of a writer who has thought fit often, in a few\r\nbrief and contemptuous words, summarily to dismiss and overrule those\r\nconclusions which were the result of a life spent on more intimate terms\r\nwith natives than any I have ever been able to hear of. And Mr. Pope's\r\nstatements are the more calculated to impose on the general reader, as he\r\nspeaks of having had \"more than twenty years of a somewhat intimate\r\nintercourse with the Hindoos;\" the fact being that he spent the greater\r\npart (in fact, all but a few years, as far as I have been able to\r\nascertain) as head of the Grammar School on the Nilgiri Hills, where he\r\nhad no more opportunity of having any intercourse with natives than a\r\nHindoo would have of gaining experience of the natives of England, were he\r\nto take up his residence on the Grampians, and interchange a few words\r\noccasionally with the shepherds of those mountains. But as to what caste\r\nhas done. \"Caste,\" says Mr. Pope, \"has prevented the Hindoos from availing\r\nthemselves of the opportunities afforded them of acquiring the sciences,\r\narts, and civilization of nations with whom they have come in contact.\"\r\nCaste, \"the great petrifier,\" we are again told, is the real cause of the\r\nstagnation that everywhere abounds. Caste, again, \"upholds immutable\r\ndistinctions by arbitrary and absurd laws, which are enforced by\r\nirresponsible authority, and maintains a standard of right and wrong\r\nentirely independent of the essential principles of moral science;\" and,\r\nin order that everything may be included at one blow, we are finally told,\r\nin a note appended to the remarks of the Abbé on the moral and social\r\nadvantages of caste, that \"caste, and its offspring custom, are among the\r\nhindrances to all good in India.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is still more curious to observe how men of intelligence and\r\nobservation can be led, by the force of inherited opinion, into statements\r\nas to the effects of caste which are actually contradicted by their own\r\nexperience. And in Mr. Raikes's interesting work, \"Notes of the\r\nNorth-Western Provinces,\" we find an instance of how people will always\r\nattribute everything to this universal bugbear. Observing on the pride of\r\nhigh caste, \"which withers whatever it touches,\" Mr. Raikes informs us\r\nthat the Brahmins and Rajpoots of the rich province of Benares will not\r\ntouch the plough owing to pride of caste. He next tells us that caste is\r\nlittle regarded to the north of Allahabad, where, from various causes, the\r\ndemand for labour is greater. All of which, being traced to its true\r\ncause, simply amounts to this, namely, that where landed proprietors of\r\ngood family are well off they naturally do not care to work, whereas in\r\nanother part of the country where they are not well off, or cannot procure\r\nlabourers, they do work. In the same way, the author, after telling us\r\nthat infanticide has at one time or other been common all over the world,\r\ntells us that in India it is entirely caused by caste. Now, if we take\r\ncaste to mean family pride solely, it certainly has influenced the matter,\r\nor at least tended to maintain the evil complained of; but I know of one\r\ninstance, at least, in India where infanticide can be traced to\r\nsatisfactory causes, and amongst a people who have always been observed to\r\nbe remarkably free from what are called caste prejudices. The Toda tribe,\r\non the Nilgiri Hills, are polyandrists, and, in order to keep down the\r\nnumber of the tribe, they naturally had recourse to female infanticide.\r\nThis they have now abandoned, and my Toda guide very soon told me the\r\nreason. He said, \"Formerly we used to kill the females, because we had\r\nlittle more than the produce of our buffaloes to depend on; but now that\r\nmore people have flocked to the hills we can let our lands and get plenty\r\nto eat.\" He added, also, that the Government had ordered them not to kill\r\ntheir children; but, unless their means had improved, it is plain that a\r\nGovernment order would have had little effect. But, as regards this\r\nsubject of infanticide, it seems to be a thing difficult to avoid,\r\nwhenever conditions arise which are favourable to its extension; nor will\r\nrepressive measures alone ever place any very complete check upon it. Like\r\nevery other demand, it rises and falls with the necessities of the\r\nsituation, and can never be originally caused by anything in the shape of\r\ncaste feelings or regulations; and amongst these necessities I, of course,\r\ninclude the desire to avoid shame, or the prospect of shame in the family,\r\nor starvation, as well as the fact that women are an encumbrance to some\r\ntribes. Some people, I may add, are under the impression that polyandric\r\nhabits, when once established, become necessarily a cause of infanticide.\r\nBut we have no means of knowing that this was ever the case, while the\r\nCoorgs may be pointed to as a race who once were polyandrous, but who were\r\nnever, that I am aware of, accused of infanticide. The explanation of\r\nthis, I apprehend, is to be found in the fact that their circumstances\r\nwere comfortable enough to preclude any necessity for keeping down the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIt is time now that I should bring this chapter to a close, but, as it may\r\nbe a convenience to the reader, I think it well, before doing so, to sum\r\nup those conclusions which I assume to have been established; in doing so\r\nI shall, however, merely take notice of those points which seem to me to\r\nbe of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, we compared the morality of our British\r\ncounties, as regards the connection of the sexes and the use of alcohol,\r\nwith the morality of the Indian county of Manjarabad; and having seen\r\nthat, owing to caste laws, the morality of Manjarabad is superior, I think\r\nwe are justified in concluding that these laws have acted more effectually\r\nthan all the religious instruction that has for centuries been lavished on\r\nthe people of this country; or, to put the case in shorter terms, we may\r\nassert that, as regards the branches of morality alluded to, caste has\r\nbeaten Christian influences.\r\n\r\nIn the next place we took into consideration the action of our\r\nmissionaries as regards caste, and having seen that they have always\r\ninsisted on their converts entirely renouncing customs which can be proved\r\nto produce the most valuable results, we came to the conclusion that it\r\nhas been a fortunate thing for India that its peoples have rejected our\r\nhide-bound interpretation of Christianity. We then inquired as to whether\r\nthe missionaries had any right to debar from the advantages of\r\nChristianity those who, wishing to become Christians, yet desired to\r\nretain their social customs; and, having come to the conclusion that there\r\nis nothing idolatrous in these customs, we have distinctly asked those\r\ninterpreters of Christianity whom we have in India to tell us by whose\r\nauthority they have ventured to act in a way which, as has been shown, the\r\nApostles never did as regards the prejudices of their Jewish converts. And\r\ngenerally, as regards the action of our missionaries in this matter, we\r\nhave felt ourselves justified in asserting that our English missions have\r\ninflicted an incalculable injury on the cause of Christianity by\r\npresenting it to the people of India as something that must necessarily\r\ntear the whole framework of their society to pieces.\r\n\r\nWe then inquired more particularly into the origin of caste, and, having\r\nseen that it never could have originated in the way our missionaries\r\nsuppose it to have done, we hazarded a conjecture as to the way in which\r\nit probably did originate, and saw grounds for supposing that the\r\ndistinctions of caste came naturally about, and that they were in\r\nprinciple calculated to effect exactly the same ends that the Jewish\r\nlawgivers had in view when they framed that Levitical law which\r\neffectually prevented the Jews from mingling socially with the races they\r\nlived amongst. We then looked at caste from a sanitary point of view, and\r\ncame to the conclusion that in consequence of the carrion-eating habits of\r\nthe lowest castes, and of their liability to transmit the germs of\r\ndisease, the rules which prevented them from coming into contact with the\r\nhigher castes, either in the way of taking the Sacrament, or in any other\r\nway, are of the greatest value. We next inquired into the effects of caste\r\nas regards social intercourse, and especially as regards the exercise of\r\nhospitality amongst people of different castes, and saw reason to think\r\nthat the restrictions of caste, with, perhaps, the exception of the very\r\nlowest, formed no bar whatever to the exercise of hospitality. Glancing\r\nsubsequently at the action of caste feeling in confining the sympathies of\r\nindividuals more especially to the members of their own caste, we came to\r\nthe conclusion that, though caste had undoubtedly the effect of\r\ncontracting the feelings within a narrow circle, there was to be found a\r\ncompensating advantage in the fact that the claims of caste produced, in\r\nthe aggregate, a greater amount of charity, and, in short, were calculated\r\nto produce a better general result than would be arrived at in the absence\r\nof caste feelings. And as illustrations of the advantages of this caste\r\nfeeling, we pointed to the fact of there being no poor-houses in India,\r\nand especially to the Jews in England, as affording an example of the\r\nfavourable effects of caste feeling. After this, we pointed to the fact\r\nthat, though caste had the effect of keeping one caste or order of men\r\nabove another, it had also a levelling tendency within each caste, and\r\nproduced an important point of equality which no poverty can destroy. We\r\nthen took into consideration some facts which seemed to show that families\r\ncould raise themselves to a higher rank in society by adopting the purer\r\nhabits of the classes above them; and we also saw that the influence of\r\nwealth does, to a very great degree, elevate a man of low caste in the\r\nsocial scale. We next saw reason to suppose that we have hitherto been\r\nlabouring under very exaggerated notions as to the stringency of caste\r\nregulations, and two instances were given to illustrate the way in which\r\ncaste laws are sometimes set summarily aside. And, finally, we pointed\r\nout, and gave some illustrations to prove, that with most of our\r\ncountrymen who have either tried to introduce new customs or in any way to\r\nalter native habits of action, caste has ever been made, and very unjustly\r\nmade, the common scapegoat.\r\n\r\nOne word more. The absolute good that caste has done may be briefly summed\r\nup. It has acted as a strong moral police, and as a preserver of order and\r\ndecorum in the community,[46] and it has prevented the spread of bad\r\nhabits and customs, more especially that of drinking, as far as large\r\nnumbers of the people are concerned.[47] On the other hand, caste is said\r\nto have hindered the progress of the people taken as a whole. But in every\r\ninstance where we have really tried the introduction of any art, the\r\nremoval of any public crime (as suttee and human sacrifice, for instance),\r\nthe improvement of any cultivation, the introduction of education, or of\r\nnew means of moving from place to place, we have either found caste to be\r\nno impediment at all, or an impediment so slight as not to be worth\r\nmentioning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.--With the view of obtaining information I briefly allude here to two\r\npoints with reference to caste and its effects--the (1) curious custom of\r\nthe Marasa Wokul tribe in Mysore, and (2) the influence of caste in\r\ndeveloping improved aptitudes which afterwards descend by hereditary\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, the mother of a girl is compelled to submit to the\r\namputation of the terminal joints of the third and fourth fingers of the\r\nright hand on the occasion of the betrothal of her daughter, and in the\r\nevent of a girl being motherless the mother of the bridegroom-elect must\r\nsubmit to the operation.\r\n\r\nThe custom is alluded to in the well-known work of the Abbé Dubois, and in\r\nthe appendix the editor of the second edition confirms the account given,\r\nand quotes confirmatory evidence from Colonel Wilks' \"Mysore,\" in which is\r\npublished the legend which is reported to have given rise to the custom.\r\nColonel Wilks, early in this century, saw some of the women who had been\r\noperated on. The tribe in question lives in the north-east of Mysore, but\r\nafter inquiry through the medium of natives in the interior of the\r\ncountry, I cannot now learn that the custom is continued. Perhaps, being a\r\ndisagreeable one, it may have been given up. I should feel much obliged\r\nfor any information as to the point in question.\r\n\r\nAs to the second point, I was informed in 1891 by Mr. Chatterton of the\r\nEngineering College at Madras, that he had many Brahmins under him in the\r\nworkshops, and that, though more intelligent than other castes, they are\r\nless efficient, owing to their ancestors never having been practised in\r\nany mechanical work. The influence of caste was here most perceptible, and\r\nhe could always pick out the work done by boys whose caste had been\r\nemployed in that particular work, and he further informed me that boys\r\nshowed poor proficiency in work out of the line of their particular caste.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] Manjarabad is a talook or county on the south-west frontier of\r\nMysore.\r\n\r\n[32] And that, I may observe, was a case in which a toddy-drawer, the\r\nthird caste in Manjarabad, was concerned.\r\n\r\n[33] I observe in the Administration Report for Mysore, 1867-68, that\r\nnearly all the cases in the lunatic asylum were traced either to drinking\r\nor bhang-smoking.\r\n\r\n[34] _Vide_ Sproat's \"Studies of Savage Life.\"\r\n\r\n[35] It may be observed here that there are few who know so little as to\r\nthe sexual morality of the people around them as clergymen. It does not\r\nbecome them, of course, to enter into the gossip of the village, nor does\r\nanyone care to broach such subjects in the first instance; and I may\r\nmention here that a relative of my own, a clergyman in a country parish,\r\ntold me that if anything went wrong in these respects he was the very last\r\nperson in the world to hear one word about it.\r\n\r\n[36] The Abbé Dubois makes the following remarks: \"During the long period\r\nI lived in India, in the capacity of a missionary, I have made, with the\r\nassistance of a native missionary, in all between two and three hundred\r\nconverts of both sexes. Of this number two-thirds were Pariahs or beggars,\r\nand the rest were composed of Sûdras, vagrants, and outcasts of several\r\ntribes, who, being without resources, turned Christians in order to form\r\nnew connections, chiefly for the purpose of marriage, or with some other\r\ninterested motive. Among them are also to be found some who believed\r\nthemselves to be possessed with the devil, and who turned Christians after\r\nhaving been assured that on receiving baptism the unclean spirits would\r\nleave them and never return; and I will declare it with shame and\r\nconfusion that I do not remember any one who may be said to have embraced\r\nChristianity from conviction and from quite disinterested motives. Among\r\nthese newcomers many apostatized and relapsed into paganism, finding that\r\nthe Christian religion did not afford them the temporal advantages they\r\nhad looked for in embracing it; and I am very much ashamed that the\r\nresolution I have taken to tell the whole truth on this subject forces me\r\nto make the humiliating avowal that those who continued Christians are the\r\nvery worst among my flock.\"--DR. ALLEN'S _India_, p. 522.\r\n\r\n[37] I may mention here that Sir Bartle Frere, in his paper on \"Indian\r\nPublic Works,\" said, with reference to opening up districts hitherto\r\nunpierced by roads, \"And here let me observe, in passing, without any\r\ndisparagement of my own countrymen, that I have generally found the\r\nagricultural and commercial classes of India quite as intelligent on\r\npoints of this kind as the agricultural and commercial classes of our own\r\nold-fashioned country.\" But I have always found that the people who have\r\nhad the best opportunities of judging have formed very favourable opinions\r\nas to the intelligence of the agricultural classes, who are generally\r\npainted as being entirely indifferent, and even hostile, to the best\r\nschemes undertaken for their benefit.\r\n\r\n[38] In this Circular of Bishop Wilson's, it is surprising to observe the\r\ncontradictions that exist. At one part of the Circular we are told that\r\nthe apostle's language is conclusive: and \"Seeing ye have put off the old\r\nman, and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the\r\nimage of Him that created him, where there is neither Greek nor Jew,\r\ncircumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but\r\nChrist is all, and in all,\" is quoted as evidence of the Divine wishes.\r\n\"So overwhelming,\" continues the bishop, \"is the flood by which all petty\r\ndistinctions of nation, caste, privilege, rank, climate, position in\r\ncivilization are effaced, and one grand distinction substituted.\" And yet,\r\nat another part of the Circular, we are told that the distinctions in\r\ncivil society are acknowledged by the Gospel, when they are \"the natural\r\nresult of difference of talents, industry, piety, station, and success.\"\r\nAnother decision of the apostle is quoted in the same Circular, and it is\r\nthis--\"There is neither Jew or Greek, there is neither bond nor free,\r\nthere is neither male nor female, for we are all one in Christ Jesus;\" and\r\nso, of course, we are all equal in his sight. And yet this is quoted as\r\nbeing a decision in favour of doing away with the civil institutions of\r\ncaste, which are undoubtedly the marks of that \"station\" which the bishop\r\ntells us is acknowledged by the Gospel, and in no way different from the\r\nstation that a member of the House of Lords inherits from his\r\npredecessors. And here, though I do not think that it is advisable to\r\ncling to isolated texts as evidence of the general conduct of the apostles\r\nregarding the prejudices of their converts, I may mention that Peter, in\r\nhis first Epistle, says, \"Submit yourself to every ordinance of man for\r\nthe Lord's sake.\" And if we take Dean Alford's interpretation of this, and\r\nconsider it as equivalent to a command, extending to every human\r\ninstitution (and I can see no reason why we should not), it is plain that\r\nour missionaries in India, if they wish to follow the examples of the\r\napostles, should yield to the prejudices of caste as long as they do not\r\ninvolve idolatrous rites. But it is in the general action of the apostles,\r\nas illustrated in Acts xv. 19, that the safest guide may, I apprehend, be\r\nfound; and when, with reference to difficulties as regarding the customs\r\nof their converts, St. James said (Dean Alford's edition), \"Wherefore my\r\nsentence is, that we trouble not them which from the Gentiles are turned\r\nto God; but that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of\r\nidols, from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood;\" and\r\nagain: \"For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you\r\nno greater burden than [these] necessary things; that ye abstain from\r\nmeats offered unto idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and\r\nfrom fornication; from which, if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do\r\nwell;\"--when the apostle said thus, I think we ought to feel little doubt\r\nas to the course we ought to pursue regarding the social customs of the\r\npeoples of India.\r\n\r\n[39] \"The name 'Laws of Manu,' somewhat resembles a pious fraud, for the\r\n'laws' are merely the laws or customs of a school or association of\r\nHindoos, called the Mânavas, who lived in the country rendered holy by the\r\ndivine river Saraswati. In this district the Hindoos first felt themselves\r\na settled people, and in this neighbourhood they established colleges and\r\nhermitages, or âsramas, from some of which we may suppose Brâhmanas,\r\nUpanishads, and other religious compositions may have issued; and under\r\nsuch influences we may imagine the Code of Manu to have been composed.\r\n\r\n\"The Mânavas were undoubtedly an active, energetic people, who governed\r\nthemselves, paid taxes to the kins, established internal and external\r\ntrade, and drew up an extensive system of laws and customs, to which they\r\nappended real and imaginary awards. This system appears to have worked so\r\nwell, that it was adopted by other communities, and then the organizers\r\nannounced it as laws given to them by their divine progenitor, the great\r\nMana. They added passages, moreover, which assert the divine claims of\r\nBrâhmans and the inferiority of the rest of mankind. Such assertions are\r\nlittle more than rhetorical flourishes, for Brâhmans never were either so\r\nomnipotent or so unamiable as the Code would represent them; nor were the\r\nSûdras ever so degraded. In Sanskrit plays and poems, weak and indigent\r\nBrâhmans are by no means unfrequent; and, on the other hand, we meet with\r\nSûdras who had political rights, and even in the Code find the pedigrees\r\nof great men traced up to Sûdra ancestors.\"--MRS. MANNING'S _Ancient and\r\nMediæval India_, v. i., p. 276.\r\n\r\n[40] As an instance that a man can abandon all religious rites whatever,\r\nand retain his caste unimpaired and unaltered, I may mention that my\r\nnative clerk told me that he had done nothing in the way of religion at\r\nall for years; but that, of course, made no difference to him in the eyes\r\nof his neighbours, who didn't care what he did, as long as he did not\r\ndepart from the social customs of his caste. I once said to a native\r\nshopkeeper in Bangalore, \"What religion are you of?\" \"Oh!\" he answered\r\nwith a smile, \"no religion at all, sir.\" But I need not trouble the reader\r\nwith further evidence to show that a man may drop his religion altogether\r\nwithout dropping his caste, and that therefore religion and caste have no\r\nnecessary connection with one another whatever.\r\n\r\n[41] \"Caste, though distinctly denounced by their sacred hooks, and\r\nostensibly disavowed by the Singhalese themselves, still exists in their\r\nveneration for rank, whether hereditary or adventitious. Thus every\r\ndistrict and every village has its little leader, a preeminence accorded\r\nto birth rather than property; and, by a descending scale, certain members\r\nof the community, in right of relationship or connection, assume an\r\nundefined superiority, and are tacitly admitted to the exercise of what is\r\ntechnically called an 'influence.' In the hamlets, so universal is this\r\nfeeling amongst the natives, so habitual the impulse to classify\r\nthemselves and to look up to some one as their superior in the scale of\r\nsociety, that the custom descends through every gradation of life and its\r\noccupations, and in some of the villages the missionaries found it\r\nnecessary to appoint two schoolmasters, even where there was less than\r\noccupation for one--'influence,' as well as ability to teach, being an\r\nessential qualification; and if the individual did not possess the former,\r\nit was most indispensable to associate with him some other who did.[A]\r\nAgain, if a village could not furnish a master competent to teach, it was\r\nin vain to procure one from a distance; his 'influence' did not extend to\r\nthat locality, and no pupils could he got to attend. Nor was caste itself\r\nwithout the open avowal of its force, the children of a Vellala or\r\nhigh-caste family being on no account permitted to enter the school-house\r\nof a lower-caste master. These are obstacles which prevail in all their\r\noriginal force even at the present day; and in the purely Singhalese\r\ndistricts, such as Matura, the prestige of caste is so despotic, that no\r\namount of qualification in all other particulars can overcome the\r\nrepugnance to intercourse with those who are deficient in the paramount\r\nrequisite of rank.\"--SIR J. E. TENNENT's _Christianity in Ceylon_, p. 286.\r\n\r\n[A] MS. account of Baptist Mission.\r\n\r\n[42] In the large towns this remark might not, perhaps, be justifiable.\r\n\r\n[43] Since this chapter was written, I have received well authenticated\r\ninformation of a Pariah, who had acquired both wealth and position, having\r\nbeen adopted into a superior caste. The caste was not a rich one, and he\r\nno doubt paid heavily for his admission into it.\r\n\r\n[44] The farmers in Manjarabad invariably tack on the word \"Gouda\" to\r\ntheir names, and it seems to answer for our Mr.\r\n\r\n[45] The natives imagine that every man's fate is written in invisible\r\ncharacters on his forehead.\r\n\r\n[46] Abbé Dubois.\r\n\r\n[47] It is satisfactory to learn that caste feelings and regulations have\r\na favourable influence with natives, even when they go to a foreign\r\ncountry; and it is equally satisfactory to quote the evidence of a\r\ngentleman who laughs at caste as an absurd custom. Mr. W. Sabonadière, in\r\nhis work of \"The Coffee Planter in Ceylon\" writes as follows: \"The coolies\r\nwho resort to Ceylon are of various castes. Those mostly preferred by\r\nplanters are the low castes, such as Pallans, shanars, and Pariahs, as\r\nbeing more accustomed to and fit for hard work; but, as a class, they are\r\nmore given to drink, spend their money more freely, and are more\r\nquarrelsome than the higher classes, whom their caste forbids to drink\r\narrack or spirits, and who are more cleanly in their habits, better\r\nbehaved (as fearing to lose caste), who have land of their own on the\r\ncoast, and are more interested in working regularly and gaining their\r\nwages to take away with them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE PLANTING IN COORG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British Province of Coorg consists of a mountainous and jungly tract\r\nof country with elevations of from about 2,700 to 3,809 feet. The last is\r\nthe elevation of the capital, Mercara, the tableland of which, for a\r\nstretch of about 26 miles, averages about 3,500 feet. This little province\r\nlies, as the reader will see by a glance at the map, on the south-west\r\nborder of Mysore, with which, since its annexation, it has always been\r\nconnected, and the Resident of Mysore invariably holds the post of\r\nCommissioner of Coorg. The population of Coorg is just over 170,000, and\r\nits area is 1,583 square miles, or about one-fourth of the size of\r\nYorkshire. But, though small in extent and population, its Rajah and\r\npeople played an important part as our allies in the war with Tippoo, and\r\na full account of the facts is given in the history of Coorg which has\r\nbeen published in the \"Mysore and Coorg Gazetteer.\" The history of the\r\ncountry, however, which has been gathered up by various European writers,\r\nis by no means of an alluring character, and indeed, after the beginning\r\nof this century, a more disgusting record of cruelty and oppression it\r\nwould be difficult to find in the annals of any country. But three things\r\nat least the record most distinctly proves. The first is (though this\r\nhardly requires any additional proof) that man, though capable of being\r\nthe best, is also capable of being by far the worst of animals; the second\r\nis that, Coorg being a sample of most of India in the times preceding\r\nours, the Hindoos were perfectly right in leaving few annals behind them;\r\nand the third is that the blessings of British rule far exceed anything\r\nthat anyone could imagine who had not read something of the condition of\r\nthings in India before we took possession of it, for we have not only\r\nconferred on the people immeasurable positive benefits, but relieved them\r\nfrom the barbarous rule of cruel oppressors. In the case of Coorg there\r\ncan be no doubt that we allowed the Rajahs of that country to carry on\r\ntheir work of cruelty and oppression towards their subjects for much too\r\nlong a period of time, and our failure to act can only be partially\r\nexcused by the fact that we were, in connection with the war with Tippoo,\r\nunder great obligation to the ancestor of the Rajah we deposed. However,\r\nhis vile oppression and cruel murders, which exceed anything the reader\r\ncould believe to be possible, could no longer be tolerated, and in 1834 he\r\nwas deposed, and his country absorbed into the British Dominions. Since\r\nthat date the general welfare of the country was of course insured, and\r\nmuch of it is now a thriving coffee field which, as I shall afterwards\r\nshow, has been of the greatest benefit to Mysore, and the adjacent British\r\nterritory. Of the history and cultivation of coffee in Coorg, and my\r\nvisits to the province, I now propose to give some account.\r\n\r\nAfter the planting season of 1857 I went with a brother planter for a\r\nchange of air to Mangalore, and from thence we went to Cannanore--a\r\nmilitary station about 200 miles further down the coast--and, after a\r\nshort stay there, rode up the Ghauts into Coorg, where we found the\r\nplanters busy clearing the forest. Three years before our arrival Mr.\r\nFowler had opened the Mercara Estate, and in 1855 Mr. H. Mann, and Mr.\r\nDonald Stewart had begun work on the Sumpaji Ghaut, while Dr. Maxwell\r\nopened up the Periambadi Ghaut Estates in 1856, and in 1857 Mr. Kaundinya\r\nfounded a plantation in the Bamboo district which lies on the eastern side\r\nof Coorg. The first European plantation was, as we have seen, started in\r\n1854, but for many years previously coffee cultivation had been carried on\r\nby natives in the Nalknaad District, though it seems to be quite uncertain\r\nas to when or how it was first introduced, or where the first seeds were\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nAt first all seemed to be going well with coffee in Coorg, and for a good\r\nmany years the fatal mistake of the planters in clearing down the whole\r\nforest, and leaving no shade over the coffee, was not decisively apparent,\r\nand from the lands that were thus cleared down on the above-mentioned\r\nGhauts, which lie on the western side of the province, from 700 to 1,000\r\ntons were picked annually when the coffee was at its best. But what in\r\n\"the seventies\" represented about £100,000 of valuable property, gradually\r\nbecame more and more unprofitable, till at last the estates were\r\nabandoned, and the land has now become covered with masses of Lentana (a\r\ncrawling, climbing, thorny plant which has become a perfect plague in\r\nCoorg), amidst which may occasionally be seen the white walls of unroofed\r\nbungalows, and dismantled pulping houses, which testify to the melancholy\r\nending of the work of the planters whom I found so busily engaged when, in\r\n1857, I first entered Coorg.\r\n\r\nSome attributed the failure to the Bug, some to the Borer, and to leaf\r\ndisease, while others blamed the heaviness of the tropical rains, which\r\nwashed away the valuable surface soil, the flight of which towards the\r\nwestern sea was much expedited by weeding with the mamoty (a digging hoe),\r\nwhich loosened the soil, and so prepared the way for its more rapid\r\ndisappearance. And these causes no doubt hastened the end, but they were\r\nmainly results arising from one great cause--the neglect to supply shade\r\nfor the coffee, and this again arose from the circumstance that most of\r\nthe pioneer planters came from Ceylon where the coffee is planted in the\r\nopen, and where shade is not required. And this failure, owing to the\r\nneglect of shade, had a most unfortunate effect, for it was owing to this\r\nthat Coorg naturally acquired such a doubtful coffee reputation in the\r\neyes of the uninformed public--a reputation which, as I shall afterwards\r\nshow, arose not from any fault of the country as a coffee field, but\r\nsolely from the fatal mistake of attempting to plant without providing\r\nshade for the coffee. And this mistake the planters, as we shall see, had\r\ngreat difficulty in shaking off, for when they saw the inevitable end\r\napproaching, and hastened to take up land in the eastern part of Coorg in\r\nwhat is known as the Bamboo district (because the jungle lands there\r\nconsist very largely of forest trees interspersed with clumps of bamboos),\r\nthey persisted in carrying their fatal Ceylon system with them, and Mr.\r\nDonald Stewart, called the Coffee King in Mincing Lane, who was a warm\r\nsupporter of planting in the open, even issued, it is said, an order to\r\nhis managers saying that if he found a single forest tree standing (the\r\ncoffee around even a single tree would have proved him to be wrong)\r\ndismissal would follow. But nature proved to be too strong for Mr. Stewart\r\nand those who followed his example, and whole estates in the Bamboo\r\ndistrict were practically exterminated by the Borer insect. At last the\r\nplanters, warned by a long and bitter experience, gave way all along the\r\nline, and began to imitate the shade planters of Mysore, and shade is now\r\nas universal in Coorg as in Mysore, and under its protection the coffee in\r\nboth countries thrives equally well. I may mention here that the Rev. G.\r\nRichter, who is now the second oldest resident in Coorg, took an active\r\npart in opening up the Bamboo district, and was for some time a partner in\r\none of the estates. He has shown great zeal in endeavouring to introduce\r\nnew products, such as tea, cocoa, ceara rubber, and vanilla. His manual\r\nof Coorg, I may add, is most interesting and exhaustive.[48]\r\n\r\nBesides the first mentioned, and now abandoned coffee district, and the\r\nBamboo district, there is the important district of North Coorg, which,\r\nthough it has a smaller number of estates, certainly contains coffee that,\r\nso far as I am able to judge, it would be impossible to surpass.\r\n\r\nThere are, in all, at present in Coorg 130 European estates, with a total\r\narea of 32,323 acres (of which 20,000 are in the Bamboo district), and\r\n6,207 native estates and gardens, aggregating in all 70,669 acres. The\r\naverage production of coffee from all these sources is estimated by\r\ncompetent authorities at from 4,000 to 5,000 tons of coffee per annum, or\r\nof a probable annual value of from £250,000 to £300,000. The yield from a\r\nwell cultivated estate averages from 3 to 4 cwt. of clean coffee per acre.\r\nExceptional properties there are, of course, which give higher returns\r\nthan this, and some could be quoted which give 6 to 7 cwt. on the average,\r\nwhile sensational figures might be quoted as regards some remarkable\r\nestates. But to give an account of such exceptional estates might convey a\r\nmisleading idea of the general return to be obtained from coffee in Coorg,\r\nthough I think it well to allude to the fact that better returns than\r\nthose first mentioned can be obtained, and have been obtained, as it is\r\nalways of value to know what particular pieces of land can do under the\r\nmost favourable circumstances, as this opens up the important question as\r\nto whether it would not pay better to confine cultivation on an estate to\r\na narrow area of the best soils and situations on it--a subject to which I\r\nshall more particularly refer later on in this chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the case of well cultivated estates, an expenditure of eighty rupees\r\nper acre is incurred on superintendence and field labour, and fifty rupees\r\nan acre on manures and their application, but in many European, and most\r\nnative estates, a total expenditure for superintendence, labour and\r\nmanures of about eighty rupees only is incurred, and the results obtained\r\nare, of course, proportionately smaller. The native gardens and\r\nplantations are, as a rule, worked on the principle of taking everything\r\nthat can be got out of the land, and putting nothing into it. Were these\r\nworked on European principles, it is hardly necessary to say that the\r\nexport of coffee from Coorg would be largely increased.\r\n\r\nCattle manure, bones, oil-cake and fish constitute the manures mainly used\r\nin Coorg. The first is universally recognized as being the most valuable\r\nfor coffee, but the supply available in the Bamboo district (which\r\ncontains, I may remind the reader, 20,000 out of the 32,323 acres under\r\ncultivation by Europeans), where grazing is scarce, is so small that\r\nplanters have to depend to a great extent on the three last-named manures.\r\nMessrs. Matheson & Co., the owners of about 7,000 acres of coffee in\r\nCoorg, kept for some years in their employ an analytical chemist,[49]\r\nwhose time was devoted to the analysis of soil, and the making of\r\nexperiments on their estates, with the view of ascertaining what was best\r\nadapted for maintaining and improving their fertility. Salts of various\r\nkinds were experimented with, but, though the results from them were\r\ngenerally favourable, they were found to be too rapidly soluble for a\r\nclimate so subject to heavy falls of rain. In the end, after many\r\nexperiments, he came to the conclusion that the four above-mentioned\r\nmanures were the best for the climate, and that the proportion applied\r\nshould vary with the condition of the coffee. To illustrate this point I\r\nmay add that in Coorg, bones and oil-cake are usually applied in the\r\nproportion of two of the latter to one of the former. If, however, a field\r\nhas suffered badly from leaf disease (which destroys many of the leaves),\r\nor is not making wood as rapidly as it ought, it is customary to apply a\r\nlarger proportion of oil-cake, or in some cases, to put down that manure\r\nwithout adding any bones. On the other hand, if there is a superabundance\r\nof wood, and it is desirable to throw the whole energies of the tree into\r\nthe production of berries, then the proportion of bone manure is increased\r\nand that of oil-cake diminished.\r\n\r\nIn former times all manures were applied immediately after the crop was\r\npicked, and on estates where labour is scarce, or comes in late in the\r\nseason, this system is still carried on. But from results actually\r\nobtained on estates in Coorg, it has now been proved that it is more\r\nadvantageous to apply part of the manure immediately after crop, in order\r\nto strengthen the tree when the blossom showers fall (which they usually\r\ndo in March and April), and to aid it in perfecting and setting the\r\nblossom, and a second portion after the heavy monsoon rains are over, in\r\norder to assist the tree in growing fresh wood, and in maturing the crop.\r\nThe bones, oil-cake, and fish are usually mixed with burnt earth--a cubic\r\nyard to every five cwt. of the manure--and then scattered on the surface\r\nof the land around the stems of the trees, and forked in. The burnt earth,\r\nor indeed almost any good earth, makes an admirable addition to bones,\r\noil-cake, and fish, for, though the first two, or the last two, furnish\r\ncomplete manure for coffee, they of course cannot ameliorate the physical\r\ncondition of the soil, which, as I have fully shown in the chapter on\r\nmanures, is often of more importance than its strictly speaking chemical\r\ncondition. The burnt earth, in short, takes the place of cattle manure as\r\na physical agent, and, for that purpose, I think that the soil, is to be\r\npreferred to cattle manure, as the former would certainly be cheaper and\r\nmore lasting in its effects in keeping the soil in a loose and easily\r\nworkable condition. On the other hand, it must be considered that cattle\r\nmanure would be more moisture-holding than ordinary earth, though not more\r\nso than jungle top-soil, and when first applied, would be perhaps more\r\nopening to the land, than burnt or ordinary earth, but if the red earth\r\n(Kemmannu), to which I have alluded in my chapter on manures, can be\r\nobtained, that, I know from experience, would be more cooling, and\r\nmoisture-absorbing than cattle manure.\r\n\r\nI now turn to a point of great general interest, and one which furnishes\r\nanother illustration of what I dwelt upon at some length in my\r\nintroductory chapter, the wide-spreading value arising from the\r\nintroduction into India of English capital which, as I have shown,\r\ndevelops the agricultural resources of the country in ever-widening\r\ncircles. At first in Coorg the adjacent province of Mysore was the only\r\nsource of labour supply, but the increased prosperity of the labourer\r\nconsequent upon ample employment and enhanced rates of wages, enabled him\r\nto take up land for the cultivation of cereal crops in the neighbourhood\r\nof his own village, and hence the supply of labour declined, those who\r\ncame to work in the plantations came later in the season, and altogether\r\nthe labour supply from Mysore became more uncertain every year. Planters\r\nconsequently, as they had in Mysore itself, had to go further afield, and\r\nnow draw labour to a large extent from the Madras Presidency, the\r\nlabourers from which in turn, will now have the means of developing the\r\nagricultural resources of their native villages. This is a point to which\r\nthe attention of the Government cannot be too often drawn with the view of\r\nencouraging the opening up, by it, of every means of stimulating the\r\nemployment of labour in India.\r\n\r\nCoorg is now fairly well off for labour, and the old labour difficulties\r\nwhich used to be experienced have to a great extent disappeared. The\r\naverage cost of Mysore labour--men, women, and children, and including the\r\ncommission of the Maistries (as the men who collect and bring the\r\nlabourers to the estates are called), is from 3 annas 6 pie to 4 annas a\r\nday (or say 5d. to 6d. a day, calculating the rupee at par, or 2s.).\r\nIn quite recent times the maistries, who obtained large sums from the\r\nplanters to make advances to the coolies, sometimes absconded with the\r\nmoney and thereby great losses ensued. But a better class of maistries\r\nhave arisen, and Messrs. Matheson and Co. have now, with the aid of their\r\npermanent European labour agent, established a system of private\r\nregistration by which the antecedents, status, and resources of the\r\nmaistries are duly recorded. And though the services of doubtful maistries\r\ncannot as yet be altogether dispensed with, a preference is of course\r\ngiven to those of well established reputation, and the class of maistries\r\ngenerally is beginning to understand and appreciate the system of\r\nregistration, which has every prospect of becoming general, and will, I\r\nneed hardly add, be of great advantage to planters. But if maistries\r\nsometimes swindle their employers, the former are often liable to be\r\nswindled by the coolies to whom the advances have been made, and until a\r\nsystem of compulsory Government registration of advances to coolies is\r\nintroduced, as recommended in one of my chapters on coffee planting in\r\nMysore, it will be impossible to put our peculiar system of giving\r\nadvances to coolies on a reasonably safe footing.\r\n\r\nThe plantations in Coorg have suffered, and still suffer considerably from\r\nleaf disease and Borer, to both of which I have, for practical purposes,\r\nsufficiently alluded in the chapter on the diseases of coffee. The\r\neffects of the former, though entailing much injury on coffee in Coorg,\r\nhave not been so fatal as in Ceylon, as the long stretches of dry weather,\r\noften of four or five months' duration, seem to kill off large numbers of\r\nthe spores, and so mitigate the damage arising from the disease. Messrs.\r\nMatheson and Co., at the instance of the chemist previously mentioned,\r\nsent out Strawsoniser spray engines for the purpose of treating afflicted\r\ntrees with various solutions, but, though good effects were noticeable on\r\nindividual trees, it was found that to treat whole estates in this way was\r\nquite impracticable, both from the cost and the immense amount of labour\r\nthat would be required, and this fatal obstacle to the use of such\r\nremedies has been amply proved in Ceylon. But in Coorg the Borer is much\r\nmore to be dreaded than leaf disease, and its ravages are such that even\r\non the best estates fully twenty-five per cent.[50] of the acreage is\r\nunder supplies (i.e., young plants to take the place of the old ones\r\nwhich have died), and the late Mr. Pringle--the chemist--was of opinion\r\nthat the loss of crop from Borer was not less than 2 cwt. per acre per\r\nannum. Before the introduction of shade the total extermination of an\r\nestate was far from uncommon, the estate in the Bamboo district opened by\r\nRev. H. A. Kaundinya in 1857 being the first to perish, and though, as we\r\nhave seen, owing to the introduction of shade, the Borer has been largely\r\nbrought into subjection, considerable damage still takes place from it.\r\nNeither trouble nor expense has been spared in order to find an antidote\r\nto this pest. Rubbing the stems with the view of destroying the eggs of\r\nthe insect, and applying thereto chemical ingredients have both been\r\ntried, but with very limited results. The late Mr. Pringle's antidote\r\nconsisted of the application of two washes of alkali vat waste, costing\r\nfive rupees an acre each, but, when carried into practice, the results\r\nwere far from what he anticipated. Taking out the bored trees and burning\r\nthem has proved the most effectual way of dealing with the pest, and would\r\nbe productive of still better results if native neighbours would adopt the\r\nsame practice. But as they will not adopt this practice, their plantations\r\nbecome nursery grounds for the propagation of the insect. Many planters in\r\nthe Bamboo district pay 1 rupee per hundred for the Borer fly, and this\r\nresults in a large number being caught, but it is not supposed that any\r\nappreciable effect has been produced from this practice.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, it seems to me, that the primary cause of the\r\nexistence of so much Borer was owing to the planters having at first\r\nplanted in the open. This must have created an enormous supply of the\r\ninsect, which found a splendid breeding ground in the conditions furnished\r\nby the planters, as is evidenced by the fact of whole estates having been\r\nexterminated by it, and it will require many years of judicious shading\r\nbefore this insect can be reduced within comparatively harmless limits.\r\nThe reader will observe that I say judicious shading, and I will more\r\nfully explain what I mean by that expression when, later on in the\r\nchapter, I give an account of my tour through Coorg in 1891, and make some\r\nobservations on the proper shading of coffee.\r\n\r\nMost of the European estates in Coorg and many of the larger native\r\nplantations are held under what are called \"The Waste Land Rules,\" under\r\nwhich land is put up to auction by the State at an upset price of 2 rupees\r\nper acre (10 rupees is the upset price in Mysore), plus the value of the\r\ntimber, which adds somewhat to the price. As a rule there is now\r\nconsiderable competition for land, and as much as 100 to 150 rupees has\r\nfrequently to be paid per acre. The land so purchased is subject to no\r\nassessment up to the fourth year, but from the fourth to the ninth year 1\r\nrupee is charged, and after that 2 rupees in perpetuity. The bulk of the\r\nland suitable for coffee has been taken up, though large extents that\r\nmight be utilized are included in the State forests, and thus are not\r\navailable to the public. Hence there is little room for extension, and\r\nopenings for young men with capital are few and far between, so far as\r\nobtaining fresh forest is concerned, though of course opportunities\r\noccasionally occur for purchasing estates, or acquiring shares in them on\r\nvarious terms.\r\n\r\nAnd here I would particularly call the attention of the Government to the\r\nfollowing remarks on the reservation of land in Coorg for State forests,\r\nmuch of which, as we have seen, might be utilized for coffee.\r\n\r\nWhen, as in former times in Coorg, the planters used no shade, many good\r\narguments existed in favour of making very large reserves of forest land\r\nin order to prevent denudation, and its injurious effects on climate, and\r\non the water supply of the rivers and the country generally. But when you\r\nmerely replace the underwood of the forest with an underwood of coffee\r\nwhich completely covers the ground, and again shield this from drying\r\nwinds and the burning sun by a complete covering of trees, either those of\r\nthe original forest or others planted to take their place, the case is\r\nentirely altered, and from the coffee land thus shaded there is no more\r\nloss of water and soil (perhaps not so much loss of water, as great pains\r\nare taken to avert wash) than there was in the original forest, and the\r\nclimatic and conservative effects of forests are therefore entirely\r\nundisturbed. Wherever, then, lands exist which are suitable for coffee\r\nplanting under shade, they should certainly, in the interests of the\r\ncountry generally, and especially of the rapidly increasing population, be\r\ntaken up for coffee, and the State forests be confined to those tracts\r\nwhich, from over heavy rainfall, or other causes, are unsuitable for\r\ncoffee planting.\r\n\r\nOther products, and especially cinchona, have received a fair amount of\r\nattention in Coorg, and the land on the Ghauts to the westward, where, as\r\nwe have seen, the coffee plantations have been abandoned, proved to be\r\nwell suited for the production of the commoner kinds of bark, and large\r\nextents of abandoned or semi-abandoned lands were planted with cinchonas.\r\nBut when the prices of bark fell (whoever takes to growing a drug will\r\nsoon realize the meaning of the phrase \"a drug in the market\"), the\r\ncultivation was no longer worthy of attention, and has practically died\r\nout. Ceara rubber also met with the same fate.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that Messrs. Matheson and Co., who held no less than\r\n7,000 out of the 20,000 acres occupied by Europeans in the Bamboo\r\ndistrict, went to great expense in introducing coffee seed from Brazil,\r\nVenezuela, Costa Rica, and Jamaica, with the view of ascertaining whether\r\ncoffee grown from the seed thus imported would be less susceptible to\r\nattacks of leaf disease. But, though the plants raised from these seeds\r\nare doing exceedingly well, it was found that they were also liable to be\r\nattacked by leaf disease, often before they were even out of the nursery,\r\nand in this respect proved to be neither better nor worse than the Coorg\r\nvariety of coffee. A clearing of fifty acres has been entirely planted\r\nwith coffee raised from Blue Mountain seed, but there is nothing in the\r\nappearance of the trees to show that they are not indigenous to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nLiberian coffee has been tried experimentally in several parts of Coorg,\r\nbut I cannot learn that any results have been obtained which would tend\r\nto encourage its adoption as a substitute for the variety at present\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the Coorg planters employ at least 30,000 Mysore\r\nlabourers in addition to local labourers and those from the Madras\r\nPresidency, and of the 30,000 in question Messrs. Matheson and Co. employ\r\nno less than about 5,000 for six to eight months of the year. The 30,000\r\ncoolies, with their maistries, draw from 12 to 15 lakhs of rupees per\r\nannum (from £120,000 to £150,000, estimating the rupee at par, and for the\r\npurposes of a labourer it goes nearly as far in India as when it was so)\r\nin wages, very nearly the whole of which eventually reaches Mysore either\r\nin payment for grain or as a surplus income which the labourers annually\r\ntake with them when they return to their homes in Mysore. And as this\r\ncapital is largely employed in developing the agricultural resources of\r\nthe Mysore State, it is evident that anything that its Government could\r\ndo--in the way of railway extension or otherwise--that would stimulate the\r\nemployment of labour in Coorg would be of great advantage to the finances\r\nof Mysore. It is extremely interesting to follow the labour-spent capital\r\nof the planters of Coorg to its ultimate destination--to the western\r\ncoast, to various parts of the Madras Presidency, and far away into the\r\ninterior of Mysore, and to observe its effects on the country and its\r\nfinancial results. I am not in a position to say exactly what should be\r\ndone in the way of railways for Coorg, but I trust I have sufficiently\r\nshown that the British and Mysore Governments are equally interested in\r\ndoing all they can, in the way of railway communication and new and\r\nimproved roads, to develop and encourage the planting resources of Coorg.\r\n\r\nThe last visit I paid to Coorg was in October, 1891, immediately after the\r\nbreaking up of the Representative Assembly at Mysore, a full account of\r\nwhich I have given in a previous chapter. I left Mysore on the morning of\r\nTuesday, October 20th, and on the first day drove to Hunsur, a town of\r\nbetween four and five thousand inhabitants, which lies twenty-eight miles\r\nto the west of Mysore city. At this place are the extensive coffee works\r\nand manure preparing establishment of Messrs. Matheson and Co., by whose\r\nmanager I was most hospitably and agreeably entertained. Rather an\r\ninteresting incident in connection with a panther had once occurred at his\r\nhouse, and as this illustrates what I have previously mentioned as to the\r\n(to man) innocuous character of this animal, it may not be uninteresting\r\nto give an account of what occurred. The circumstances were these.\r\n\r\nOne night my hostess, some time after retiring to rest, heard a noise in\r\nthe open veranda which runs round the side of the bungalow just outside\r\nher bedroom. She got up, and, taking a lamp in her hand, went round a\r\ncorner of the building in the direction of the noise, and just as she\r\nturned the corner in question there fell upon her astonished vision the\r\nspectacle of a panther, which at the moment was busily engaged in\r\ndevouring the family cat. When the panther saw the lady he tried to make\r\noff along the veranda (which at that point was shut in at the side by a\r\ntrellis-work), but at the moment of his flight the cook, who had also\r\nheard the noise, appeared at the opposite end of the veranda with a lamp\r\nin his hand. The panther then turned back in the direction of the lady,\r\nwho stood spell-bound with the lamp in her hand, and as the cook,\r\napparently equally spell-bound, remained stationary with his lamp, the\r\npanther, being thus as it were between two fires, lay down under a table\r\nwhich was placed against the wall of the veranda. At last he got up, made\r\na move in the direction of the cook, and then changing his mind, rushed\r\npast the lady, and thus made his escape. Panthers seem to be numerous\r\nabout Hunsur, and I heard another interesting story of their boldness,\r\nwhich I have not space to give, from a neighbour of my host.\r\n\r\nAfter staying for a day at Hunsur, I drove, on October 22nd, to Titimutty,\r\na small village on the frontier of Coorg, where I was met by Mr. Rose, of\r\nHill Grove Estate, who drove me to his plantation near Polibetta, which is\r\nin the Bamboo district previously alluded to as containing about\r\ntwo-thirds of the European plantations in Coorg. Shortly after leaving\r\nTitimutty we drove through coffee on both sides of the road, and, though I\r\nspent four days in the district, and was constantly on the move, I was\r\nnever once out of sight of coffee, as the plantations lie in a continuous\r\nblock, and, as they are all thoroughly shaded, sometimes by the original\r\nforest trees, and sometimes by trees planted for shade, the general effect\r\nis that you are travelling through a forest of which coffee is the\r\nunderwood--a forest lying on gently undulating ground from which nothing\r\ncan be seen of the surrounding country. As the bungalows of the planters\r\nare of course surrounded by coffee and shade trees, they have necessarily\r\nan extremely shut-in appearance. But this rather _triste_ effect might be\r\nobviated (and I have with good effect obviated it in the case of a\r\nbungalow which lies in the centre of an estate of my own in Mysore) by\r\ncutting vistas here and there through the shade trees through which peeps\r\nmay be had of distant hills. This may seem to be a point of little\r\npractical value, but, as I have shown in a previous chapter, the amenities\r\nof an estate are of value, and are likely to become more so when the\r\ndesirable nature of shade coffee property is more widely known. The\r\nbungalows in the Bamboo district are very comfortable, most of them having\r\ntennis grounds, and if the vistas I have suggested were cut out, their\r\nattractiveness would be much enhanced. But if the Bamboo district has not\r\nthe scenic advantages of plantations in other parts of Coorg and in\r\nMysore, these are much compensated for by the close proximity of one\r\nplantation to another, and I was told that at certain seasons there was\r\ngenerally a well-attended lawn tennis party on every day of the week.\r\nThere is besides, in the centre of the district, a comfortable club where\r\nballs and dances are occasionally given. In short, the Bamboo district has\r\nfeatures of its own which make it entirely different from any planting\r\ndistrict in India. From being so much shut in, it might, at first sight,\r\nbe supposed to be not a very healthy district, but I heard no complaints\r\non that score, nor, from the appearance of the planters, would it have\r\noccurred to me that the district was at all unhealthy. On the evening of\r\nmy arrival there was a dinner-party, at which four ladies were present,\r\nand later on there was music and singing, and all the accompaniments of a\r\npleasant social life. So much do coffee districts vary in India, that the\r\nparty was to me a startling surprise, which the reader may easily\r\nunderstand when I mention that, after leaving the most northerly\r\nplantation in Coorg and entering my district of Manjarabad, there is only\r\none resident lady to be found there, and it is not till you reach the\r\nnorthern district of Mysore, some sixty miles further, that ladies, in the\r\nplural, again commence, though even there they do not exist to a very\r\nserious extent.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the day of my arrival I walked round my host's estate,\r\nwhich carried an excellent crop, and also visited a neighbouring property.\r\nOn the following morning I drove to the Dubarri estate, and walked round\r\npart of it, and in the afternoon visited the club--a comfortable, and in\r\nevery respect suitable, building which, as I mentioned, is occasionally\r\nused for dances. I also visited the co-operative store, which contained a\r\nlarge supply of various articles. The church, which was close to the club,\r\nhad been recently built, at a cost of 5,000 rupees, but, when I saw it,\r\nthe interior was not quite finished. I may mention that in the Bamboo\r\ndistrict there is a resident doctor who is employed by the various\r\nestates. Later on in the afternoon I rode from the club with Mr. William\r\nDavies to the Mattada Kadu estate (Messrs. Matheson and Co.'s property),\r\nof which he is manager, and rode through coffee all the way to the\r\nbungalow. I was most kindly entertained by Mr. Davies, who had a party of\r\nthe neighbouring planters to meet me at dinner, after which we had much\r\ntalk on the subject in which we were all mutually interested. On the\r\nfollowing morning I awoke early, and was rather surprised, shortly after\r\ndaylight, to hear the names of the coolies called over from the\r\ncheck-roll, as, though early hours were kept in the old days in Mysore, we\r\nhave now become considerably later, owing, I surmise, to feeling that in\r\nthese labour-competing days we are not as completely master as we once\r\nwere. After a small breakfast I rode through the estate, guided by Mr.\r\nDavies, who was accompanied by two of his guests of the night before, and\r\nwe then passed into the Nullagottay estate (all Messrs. Matheson's), after\r\nwhich we entered into Whust Nullagottay, and went to the bungalow from\r\nwhich (there is always an exception) there is a fine view of the\r\nBrahmagiri Hills. After a very short stay we again mounted, and presently\r\npassed into the Whoshully estate, and finally arrived, after riding\r\nthrough that property, at about midday at Mr. Robinson's bungalow, where\r\nwe had breakfast. Mr. Rose came over in the afternoon, and we rode home to\r\nHill Grove through Messrs. Matheson's estate which had been bought from\r\nMr. Minchin, besides visiting the Hope estate. I thus rode through coffee\r\nfor nearly the entire day. On the following day I went over another\r\nadjacent property, and on the day after, Monday, October 26th, started for\r\nMercara, the capital of Coorg. I drove by way of Siddapur, paid a short\r\nvisit to Cannon Kadu estate, and arrived at Abiel, Mr. Martin's estate,\r\nat about midday, rode round his estate in the afternoon, and then drove on\r\nto Mr. E. Meynell's charming home--the Retreat--which is about a mile from\r\nthe town of Mercara.\r\n\r\nI was particularly struck with the arrangements of this house, as it was a\r\nthoroughly English-looking home in every respect, and I only wish I could\r\ngive a plan of it as a model for a residence in the hill and planting\r\ndistricts of India. The front veranda was inclosed with glass, and lined\r\nwith flowers in pots, and from the centre of this projected a\r\nconservatory, at the end of which was the front door. You thus, after\r\ndriving up to the house, walked through a conservatory into the inclosed\r\nveranda, and this not only gave a very pretty effect, but was practically\r\nuseful by keeping carriages, with their attendant dust and disagreeables,\r\nat a sufficient distance from the veranda. My hostess very kindly\r\npermitted me to see the kitchen arrangements. These, as well as the\r\nstorerooms, were in a wing projecting from the back of the bungalow. The\r\nkitchen, which consisted of a separate room, with a single door, was\r\nfurnished with a Wilson range, and there was no door between the kitchen\r\nand the scullery. The latter was at the outside edge of the wing, and was\r\nentered by its own door--an arrangement, by the way, that might be\r\npractised with advantage in this country, as a connecting door is liable\r\nto admit smells from the scullery into the kitchen. The reader will, I\r\ntrust, excuse the mention of these apparently trivial matters, but as I\r\nstrongly suspect that much of the ill-health in India is due to the dirt\r\nand horrors of the Indian cook-room, which is usually at a little distance\r\nfrom the bungalow, and turned into a general lounge for the servants, I\r\nthink it well to show that, with a little contrivance and attention, as\r\ngreat a degree of order and cleanliness may exist in India as in any other\r\nportion of the globe.\r\n\r\nOn the following day I called on Mr. Mann, son of one of the pioneer\r\nplanters of 1855, and inspected an interesting coffee garden of four acres\r\nwhich is close to his bungalow in Mercara. Some of the coffee trees were\r\nplanted thirty and others forty years ago, and they have given for many\r\nyears fifteen hundredweight an acre on the average, and though many of the\r\ntrees were evidently suffering from the effects of overbearing, there\r\nseemed no reason why they should not continue to bear good crops for an\r\nindefinite period of time. Estimating the value of the coffee at 80s. a\r\nhundredweight, the produce of an acre would be worth £60, of 100 acres\r\n£6,000, and allowing one-half for expenses--a very liberal estimate--there\r\nwould be a clear income of £3,000 a year from 100 acres of such coffee. As\r\n100 acres of land so situated--it was flat, lay in a hollow, and was well\r\nsheltered--could not be obtained, it might seem that an account of this\r\ngarden could be of no practical value. But the garden in question raises\r\none very important point in the mind, and that is whether it would not be\r\nbetter to abandon all inferior soils and situations on an estate, and\r\nconcentrate all the labour and manurial resources on a more limited area,\r\nevery operation on which could be carried out exactly at the right moment.\r\nThis is a highly important question which I state here for the\r\nconsideration of planters.\r\n\r\nAfter spending two pleasant days at the Retreat, I bade my kind host and\r\nhostess good-bye (I have thanked Mr. Meynell, who I may mention represents\r\nMessrs. Matheson's large interests in Coorg, in the preface for the\r\nvaluable information he subsequently sent me as regards planting in\r\nCoorg), and went on my way towards my home in Mysore, and stayed first at\r\nthe Hallery estate, which is about six miles from Mercara, and is the\r\nproperty of my friend Mr. Mangles. The approach to the bungalow through\r\nthe coffee is very pretty; the building stands at the head of a slope,\r\nand commands a fine and extensive view of the country and the distant\r\nhills. The amenities here had been well attended to: below the front of\r\nthe bungalow terraces edged with balustrades had been cut, and formed into\r\nflower gardens, and I was glad to see that, in parts of the plantation,\r\nfrom which good views could be had, there were seats. I may observe here\r\nthat there is a great want in plantations of seats, which are now the more\r\nneeded as all logs in the old plantations have of course disappeared. Near\r\nthe bungalow is an excellent stable, well paved, and quite in English\r\nstyle. On the following morning I wont with Mr. Sprott, who is in charge\r\nof Mr. Mangles's estate, to visit his Santigherry property, some seven\r\nmiles distant, and on the way there went on the left of the road through a\r\nplantation belonging to Messrs. Macpherson and Ainslie. After this we\r\nre-entered the main road, passed the village of Santikoopa, and then\r\nentered and went round the estate we had come to visit. On the way home we\r\ndiverged to the left and went through Mr. Murray Ainslie's estate, and\r\nround by an estate owned by Mr. Campbell, and finally arrived at Hallery\r\nat about half-past twelve. In the afternoon I went round part of the\r\nestate, which I had already seen something of on the day of my arrival.\r\n\r\nEarly the following morning, after bidding good-bye to the host and\r\nhostess who had so kindly entertained me, I started on my journey\r\nnorthwards, and after a troublesome and trying drive (for my horses), in\r\nwhich two rivers had to be crossed by ferry boats, and much deep\r\nunmetalled road struggled through, I arrived at 12.30 at\r\nCoovercolley--another estate of Mr. Mangles's--where I was kindly\r\nentertained by Mr. and Mrs. Trelawney (Mr. Trelawney manages this fine\r\nproperty). The bungalow here is particularly comfortable, and had the\r\ngreat advantage of a very wide open veranda. On the right of the approach\r\nto the bungalow was a neatly trimmed shoe flower hedge, which had a very\r\npretty effect, and, as at Hallery, terraces had been cut in front for a\r\nflower garden. From the front of the bungalow there is an extensive view\r\nof much of the Coorg country, and I was particularly struck by its\r\ncontinuous jungly character, and with its great contrast to the Mysore\r\ncountry to the north, which is not so much a jungly country, as an open\r\ngrass country studded with occasional wood, and park-like groups of trees.\r\nOn the afternoon of my arrival I rode round part of this fine estate, and\r\ninspected other parts of it on the following morning and evening. On the\r\nnext morning I started at a quarter to six, and after driving about\r\ntwenty-four miles, crossed the frontier, and entered Manjarabad--the\r\nsouthernmost coffee district of Mysore. The northernmost part of Coorg\r\nconsists of a long tongue of land which projects into Mysore, and the\r\nscenery, in its beautiful, open, and park-like character, naturally\r\nresembles that of Manjarabad.\r\n\r\nOn my visit to Coorg I look back with pleasure. It was, indeed, extremely\r\nenjoyable and instructive, and I cannot help regretting the fact that,\r\nowing to the nature of their duties, planters are obliged to remain so\r\ncontinuously at home; and then, of course, when they can get away, they\r\nnaturally go for change of air and scene anywhere out of the coffee\r\ndistricts. The result of this is that the planters of the north of Mysore\r\nsee little of those in the south, and that neither have any intercourse\r\nwith Coorg, and that, in consequence, much valuable interchange of views\r\nand experiences that might otherwise take place cannot now do so. Had such\r\nintercourse existed, many of the mistakes made in Coorg as regards shade\r\nwould probably have been avoided, and much loss of money averted.\r\n\r\nThe reader will have noticed that I have hitherto made no observations on\r\nthe coffee I saw in Coorg, my reason for not doing so being that I thought\r\nthey might be more conveniently reserved for the close of the chapter. I\r\nam glad that in the course of my observations I shall have much to say in\r\npraise of the state of coffee in Coorg, and if I should seem to be a\r\nlittle free in my remarks as to the management of shade, I trust that my\r\nCoorg readers will bear in mind that my experience of trees planted as\r\nshade to supply the place of original forest trees removed is the oldest\r\nin India, and stretches back to the year 1857, and that it requires a very\r\nlong time, as they will see by consulting the chapter on shade, before all\r\nthe points connected with shade trees can be proved with certainty. That\r\nmistakes as regards shade should have been made in Coorg, where shade\r\nexperience is comparatively recent, is not at all surprising; in former\r\ntimes numerous mistakes were made in Mysore, and have only been rectified\r\nby long experience and observation.\r\n\r\nMy general impression on going through the Bamboo district of Coorg was\r\nthat it contains a certain proportion of land of poor character (and this\r\ncan be said of most coffee districts) which should never have been opened,\r\nbut that there are many excellent and valuable estates, though it was\r\nplain to me that, from the more weakly, or perhaps I should rather say\r\nless robust, character of the shoots, and the appearance of the soil, it\r\nhad, as a rule, much less growing power in it, and would consequently\r\nrequire more manure, than the deep and heavier soils of Mysore. But these\r\nsoils in the Bamboo district, though lighter in character, are of course\r\n(and this is a fact of no small importance) more easily worked than those\r\nof Mysore. The next point that attracted my attention was the shade, and\r\nof the numerous estates that I saw in the Bamboo district there were only\r\ntwo that at all came up to my idea of what a well shaded property ought to\r\nbe. I could see little signs of the shade being varied in kind and\r\nquantity to suit the various aspects, and many trees were preserved which\r\nwere merely throwing shadow, not on to the coffee, but on to adjacent\r\ntrees. Then I found that in one excellent piece of young coffee the shade\r\nhad been planted in lines running from east to west, instead of being\r\nclosely planted in lines from north to south (_vide_ chapter on shade).\r\nThe shade, too, generally speaking, was far too largely composed of one\r\nkind of tree,--the Attí-mara (_Ficus glomerata_)--and finally this tree,\r\nthe defects of which I have remarked upon in my chapter on shade, was\r\nbadly managed by being trimmed up to a considerable height above the\r\nground. The result of this was that on land on which there was an enormous\r\nnumber of trees there was far too little shade, and a forester fresh from\r\nEngland would never have imagined that the planters had intended to grow\r\numbrageous trees for the double purpose of lowering the temperature of the\r\nplantation and sheltering the coffee from sun and parching winds, but\r\nwould have supposed that they were engaged in growing timber for sale. I\r\nsaw land which, I feel sure, had at least three times the number of trees\r\nthat would have been sufficient to shade it fully, had they been properly\r\ntreated. Such a number of trees throw out, of course, a corresponding\r\nnumber of large roots, and one planter told me that in some instances\r\ncoffee was being killed by the masses of Attí root in the land. As regards\r\nshade, then, there is much room for improvement in Coorg, and especial\r\nattention should be paid to this in the Bamboo district which has suffered\r\nso much from Borer. This pest, we know, thrives best under warm and dry\r\nconditions, and it is therefore of great importance that the kinds of\r\nshade most recommended in my chapter on shade should be freely planted,\r\nand other kinds gradually removed.\r\n\r\nThere was a very good crop on the trees when I passed through Coorg--one\r\nthat, when picked, quite exceeded the expectations of the planters--and I\r\nsaw two estates which had at once a good crop on the trees, leaves of\r\ngood, well-fed looking colour, and a show of wood giving promise of an\r\nequally good crop for the following year; and it says well for cultivation\r\nin Coorg that any estate could show this, for the tendency of coffee, as\r\nof most fruit trees, is to give heavy and light crops alternately. As it\r\nis important to know the manures that were used to produce such results, I\r\nmay mention that on one of these estates 6 cwt. of castor cake and 3 cwt.\r\nof bones had been applied the previous year, and for the four preceding\r\nyears 2 cwt. of castor cake and 1 cwt. of bone had been used, but, in the\r\nopinion of the manager, the latter application had proved too small. On\r\nthe other estate one-third of a bushel of cattle manure per tree, and from\r\n7 cwt. to 10 cwt. of bones had been applied once in three years, and\r\ncomposts also had been used to a considerable extent. These were formed\r\nfirst of a layer of vegetable rubbish, then fresh pulp and lime, and\r\nlastly a layer of soil. The estate last referred to, on which the cattle\r\nmanure, bones and compost had been used, belongs to Mr. Mangles--his\r\nCoovercolley estate--and is certainly the finest I ever saw, if we take\r\ninto consideration the state of the soil, the colour of the foliage, and\r\nthe evident prospect of continuously good crops. So well fed, indeed, was\r\nthe land with nitrogen, that an application of nitrate of soda produced no\r\nperceptible effect on the trees. The land was probably over supplied with\r\nphosphoric acid, and an analysis of the soil would be of practical value,\r\nfor if, as I have good reason to surmise, there is a very large supply of\r\nphosphoric acid in the soil, the use of bones might be suspended for some\r\nyears, and a light application of lime used instead. Ten acres, at any\r\nrate, might be tried as an experiment. I was shown one piece of coffee\r\nwhich had been manured, when it was two years old, with cattle manure, and\r\nthis piece had remained perceptibly superior ever since. On this estate\r\n600 cattle are kept for the sake of their manure. I would suggest that\r\nthe proprietor might, on say ten acres, discontinue the use of cattle\r\nmanure, and, as an experiment, apply dressings of jungle top-soil instead,\r\nor the red earth alluded to in my chapter on manures, should that be\r\navailable. The experiment might be valuable to the proprietor and to\r\nplanters in general. Cattle manure is very expensive, and when 12 to 14\r\ntons per acre--some fairly well rotted and some slightly so--were used in\r\nCoorg on one estate the cost was 72 rupees an acre, including cost of\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nIn bringing these brief remarks to a close, I may observe that I formed a\r\nvery high opinion of coffee in Coorg, and I feel confident that if the\r\nshade were remodelled on the system recommended in my chapter on that\r\nsubject, the losses from Borer and leaf disease would be largely\r\ndiminished, and a great general improvement in the coffee take place. We\r\nhave experienced such results from improved shade in Mysore, and there can\r\nbe no doubt that similar results will follow in Coorg. In remodelling the\r\nshade system, all light and dry soils should be first attended to and\r\nplanted up with trees which give an ample and cool shade. The treatment of\r\nother parts of plantations may be postponed.\r\n\r\nAs regards the profits that may reasonably be expected from well managed\r\nand well situated estates in Coorg, I am happy to say that I have obtained\r\nfrom a friend the returns from his estates for the last ten years, and as\r\nhis properties are of large extent, the return may be regarded as a very\r\nreliable one, more especially as the prices for three years of the period\r\nwere very low. The average yield per acre was 4 cwt. 1 qr. 7 lbs.; the\r\nexpenses, £9 4s. 2d., and the profits per acre £7 8s. 6d.\r\n\r\nI only wish that, in conclusion, I could give as favourable an account of\r\nthe prospects of sport in Coorg as I can of its coffee. Twenty-five years\r\nago there was good big game shooting, but the absence of game laws, and\r\nthe indiscriminate destruction of does, fawns, and cow bisons by the\r\nnatives, at every season of the year, have changed all that, and it is\r\nwith a melancholy smile that one reads in the \"Coorg Gazetteer\" that the\r\nCoorgs are such ardent sportsmen that they have hardly left a head of game\r\nin the country. But the first sign of advanced civilization--the\r\nintelligent preservation of wild animals--has begun, or will shortly be\r\nbegun, in the enlightened state of Mysore, and I trust that its good\r\nexample may soon be followed in Coorg, and all parts of India. With the\r\naid of preservation game will soon increase in the more remote forests\r\ninto which it has been driven back, and from thence spread into other\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] \"Manual of Coorg,\" compiled by Rev. G. Richter, Principal, Government\r\nCentral College, Mercara. Mangalore, 1870.\r\n\r\n[49] The late Mr. William Pringle, who, after leaving Coorg, wrote in\r\n1891, for the \"Madras Mail,\" some interesting and suggestive papers on the\r\ncultivation of coffee.\r\n\r\n[50] I make this statement on the authority of Mr. Meynell (_vide_\r\npreface), and it is, no doubt, the result of his experience in the Bamboo\r\ndistrict, but his estimate could hardly, I should say, apply to the\r\nestates I visited in North Coorg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE PLANTING IN MYSORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a long and attentive observation of the various occupations of life,\r\nI have no hesitation in saying that, for one who has to earn his bread\r\nsomewhere, the life of a planter in Mysore, if not the very pleasantest\r\nand most interesting (and as far as my own experience goes it is both) in\r\nthe world, is assuredly one of the most agreeable occupations that anyone\r\nof intelligence, industry, and active habits, and fond of sport and an\r\nindependent and open-air life, could betake himself to. It will be\r\nobserved that I place intelligence in the van, and I do so because, though\r\nthere is some truth in the native proverb which declares that, \"with\r\nplenty of manure even an idiot may be a successful agriculturist,\" I know\r\nof no occupation that calls for a greater degree of intelligence and\r\nsteady application than that of a planter in Mysore, or any district where\r\nshade trees are required. For where the planter has only to deal, as he\r\nhas in Ceylon, with the coffee on his land and nothing else, the business,\r\nthough even then of course requiring considerable skill and intelligence,\r\nis comparatively speaking a simple one. But in Mysore the necessity of\r\nproviding shade for the coffee gives us at once an additional and highly\r\ncomplicated business in the planting and management of the shade trees,\r\nand their selection and distribution to suit the various soils, aspects\r\nand gradients we have to deal with. Then the fact of having shade trees,\r\nwhich of course take up much of the manure intended for the coffee, makes\r\nthe application of the manure, and especially the quantity to be put down\r\nat a time, a matter of constant doubt, for on the one hand, how much do\r\nthe shade trees not rob us of, and on the other hand, how much do they not\r\nreturn to the land by their fallen leaves? Then should we not manure and\r\ncultivate in a different manner and degree the coffee under the direct\r\nshade of the trees, and the coffee in the open spaces between them? Such\r\nare some of the numerous points connected with coffee planting under\r\nshade, to which I briefly allude at the outset in order to show those who\r\nwish to plant coffee that a high degree of intelligence, and power of\r\nobservation, are required to make a successful planter. Then it must be\r\nconsidered further that a colloquial knowledge of the Kanarese language\r\nmust be acquired--a language which, from its admixture of ancient and\r\nmodern Kanarese, the variation in the accent, and the words in common use\r\nin various parts of the country, is generally considered to be the most\r\ndifficult in India. And, as will be seen further on, it requires no small\r\namount of study and observation in order to determine how best to lay out\r\nmoney in the purchase or manufacture of manures. There is also occasion\r\nfor much tact, firmness, and temper, in dealing with the labourers and\r\noverseers on the estates, and also the native population with which nearly\r\nall the estates in Mysore are surrounded. Then much tact and judgment is\r\nrequired in dealing with the Government officials. Other points might also\r\nbe added, but I have probably said enough to caution those who may be\r\ninclined to embark in coffee planting in Mysore, against assuming, as has\r\nhitherto been too often done, that it is a business which may be managed\r\nby people of inferior capacity.\r\n\r\nI have said that the occupation is an agreeable one, and may add that,\r\nthough the life of a planter involves much attention to his business,\r\nthere is no really hard work in the sense that there is hard work in the\r\ncolonies, and, from the coffee being in shade, there is no exposure to the\r\nsun, while as all the preparation of the crop is done by agents on the\r\ncoast, there is none of that indoor factory work which tea planters have\r\nto undertake. Then the climate, taking it all the year round, is\r\ndistinctly an agreeable one,--an exquisitely fine one in the winter, never\r\ndisagreeably warm in the hot weather, owing to the coffee districts being\r\nunder the influence of breezes from the western sea, only disagreeably wet\r\nin the monsoon, though then the climate is so fresh and healthy, that many\r\nfind that season of the year to be by no means unpleasant. Besides, during\r\nthe worst part of the wet season, there is comparatively little to do, and\r\nthe owner of an estate can then leave home for change of air and scene. As\r\nregards the healthiness of Mysore, I can only say that everything depends\r\non the discretion of the individual. If he chooses to take reasonable care\r\nof himself, experience shows that the climate is a decidedly healthy one,\r\nbut if he chooses to expose himself unnecessarily, and fails to take those\r\nprecautions as regards food, and against chills which all sensible people\r\ndo, then he will be pretty sure to get fever. I may mention that the\r\nelevations of the coffee estates vary from 2,800 to about 4,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, which partly accounts for the temperate nature of\r\nthe climate, though this of course is, as I have previously pointed out,\r\nvery largely controlled and improved by the estates being under the\r\ninfluence of the charming sea-breezes of the Western Ghauts. And if the\r\nplanter wishes to avoid the hot weather altogether, he has only to go to\r\nOotacamund, 7,000 feet above sea-level, where he will not only come in for\r\na delightful climate, but for the Ootacamund season. April and May may be\r\npleasantly spent there, and when the monsoon begins in June, the planter\r\nwho desires to avoid it can go to Bangalore, where he will be in time for\r\nthe season there, and he can afterwards return to his estate in September.\r\nThis is a change I can recommend from practical experience. Or should a\r\nchange to England be preferred, the planter should leave India about the\r\nend of April, and return in October. Such changes as these of course are\r\nonly to be thought of when the planter has made his way in the world; and\r\nI only allude to them here to show that he may personally see to the\r\ncarrying out of all the important operations from October till April, and\r\neither spend the remainder of his time under most agreeable circumstances\r\nin India, or pass the summer and autumn in England. In former days such\r\nchanges could not reasonably have been contemplated, owing partly to the\r\ntime taken up in travelling, and partly to the cost, but we now have\r\nrailways within thirty to sixty miles of the various plantations, and it\r\nis certain that at no very distant date these distances will be halved,\r\nand that we shall then be within seventeen to eighteen days of London--at\r\npresent we may be said to be within eighteen to nineteen days of it. In\r\nexpense the cost has been halved; a first-class return ticket from Bombay\r\nto London may now be had for £90, and on other lines of steamers the rates\r\nare lower. But it is now time to turn from matters of detail to consider\r\nthe advantages of coffee in Mysore, as a good, safe, and permanent\r\ninvestment, and in order to show that the two last mentioned statements\r\nare well founded, I have obtained some details which will show the\r\nprobable profits of coffee in Mysore. For obvious reasons I withhold the\r\nnames of the estates. I have said that the investment is a permanent one,\r\nand by this I mean that, unless ruined by profound and incredible\r\nstupidity, a well shaded coffee estate in Mysore will last as long as the\r\nworld will, or at any rate as long as the inhabitants of it choose to\r\ndrink coffee, and in confirmation of this opinion, I may mention that one\r\nof the most flourishing pieces of coffee I have ever seen in Mysore was\r\nplanted on land first opened about ninety-five years ago, and which was\r\nreplanted about seventy years after it was first opened. I can also point\r\nto land opened in 1857, and which has in recent years been replanted with\r\nthe new variety of coffee imported from Coorg, and, as the owner of it\r\nsaid to me last year when we were going round the property, \"The estate is\r\nnow looking better than you have ever seen it.\" But all the old estates in\r\nMysore that were planted in the proper coffee zone are in existence now,\r\nand many of them look better than they ever did. The durability of coffee\r\nproperty in Mysore, then, is, as we have seen, not a subject of\r\nspeculation, but an ascertained fact, and I now proceed to show that it is\r\nas profitable as it is durable.\r\n\r\nThe first case I have to give relates to coffee property purchased by a\r\nfriend of mine with money borrowed at eight per cent. interest, and with\r\nhis permission I publish an account of his investment, as it not only\r\nshows what has been done in Mysore in the face of great difficulties, but\r\nillustrates the profits that may be expected from a property that is well\r\nmanaged, and well situated as regards soil and climate. In 1876, then, he\r\npurchased a native estate of 240 acres of good coffee land, of which 180\r\nacres had been very irregularly planted with \"chick\" coffee (the original\r\nMysore plant). The total cost amounted to 98,000 rupees, which sum was\r\nborrowed at eight per cent. By 1880 the loan was reduced, from the profits\r\nof the coffee, by about 30,000 rupees, and my friend then purchased an\r\nadjoining native estate of 163 acres, sixty of which were also very\r\nirregularly planted with chick coffee. The price was 13,250 rupees, which\r\nhe also borrowed at eight per cent. The total amount borrowed was thus\r\n111,250 rupees, and the total coffee land was 403 acres. Up to about this\r\ntime the chick coffee had done fairly well, and by 1880 the loan, as we\r\nhave seen, was reduced by 30,000 rupees, but soon afterwards this variety\r\nof coffee plant began rapidly to deteriorate all over the district, and\r\nestates like my friend's, which had hitherto given satisfactory profits,\r\ndid but little more than pay their working expenses. But, luckily for\r\nhimself, my friend, directly after the purchase of each estate, began to\r\nplant them with the Coorg kind of coffee (afterwards fully alluded to in\r\nthis chapter) which had been recently introduced, and, as the old chick\r\ntrees were from six to seven feet high, and had no lower branches, they\r\ndid not for some time interfere with the progress of the Coorg plants, and\r\nyielded enough to pay expenses. As the Coorg plants came into bearing the\r\nold chick plants were removed, and in 1887-88 nearly ninety tons of coffee\r\nwere picked, and by that year the whole debt, principal and interest, was\r\npaid off, and a considerable balance was left over to my friend's credit.\r\nIn 1889-90 the property gave him a clear profit of £3,350, and it has done\r\nwell ever since. Thus with all these tremendous difficulties to contend\r\nwith, and in the face of the loss of all the old coffee, and after having\r\nto replant the whole property at great expense, my friend found himself in\r\nthe possession of an estate, free of all debt, capable of yielding good\r\nannual profits. And it must be remembered, further, that this result was\r\nobtained, not from virgin forest land exclusively, but from land the\r\ngreater part of which consisted of old native plantations.\r\n\r\nThere are, I need hardly say, no means of ascertaining the profits that\r\nmay be expected from coffee in Mysore, but the following analysis of a\r\nManjarabad estate of 400 acres under cultivation, which has been supplied\r\nto me by a friend, will form a fair guide to what may be reasonably\r\nexpected from a Mysore estate where the management is good. In the case\r\nin question, the average crop for the last five years, has been 3-3/4 cwt.\r\nan acre. The expenses were 111-1/2 rupees an acre, and the average profit\r\n111-1/10 rupees per acre per annum, or rather over £7 2s. 6d. an acre. I\r\nmay add that I consider this a fair average estimate of what may be\r\nexpected in Mysore on a well managed estate, as a considerable proportion\r\nof the land in question is of decidedly inferior quality. I have no\r\nspecial details to give from the northern part of Mysore, but I am\r\ninformed by a planter of experience, who resides in that part of the\r\ncountry that, from a good estate of 200 acres, a profit of from £1,500 to\r\n£2,000 a year may be counted on.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the life is attractive, that coffee property is durable\r\nand profitable, and the reputation of the coffee is not exceeded by any\r\ncoffee in the world, and, as I shall show further on, the plant is\r\nsingularly free, when properly shaded and worked, from risk in any form,\r\nor pests of any kind. Nothing, in short, in the world would appear to be\r\nmore desirable as a source of investment than coffee in Mysore, for those\r\nwho are prepared to understand and look after it. And with all these\r\nalluring advantages, which I have, I believe, most accurately described,\r\nit might naturally be supposed that, coffee property in Mysore could be\r\nreadily disposed of on advantageous terms to the seller. As a matter of\r\nfact, it is quite unsalable at any price that would be at all satisfactory\r\nto the owners. The explanation of this is very simple. Those who are\r\nworking their own estates on the spot seldom command enough capital to\r\ninvest in new estates, or do not care to extend their property, while\r\ncapitalists at a distance, have, from the absence of information, no means\r\nof judging as to whether coffee in Mysore is a good investment or not.\r\nInstead, then, of accurate, or fairly accurate, accounts to rely on, we\r\nhave nothing but vague and misleading statements and reports, which often\r\naffect most injuriously industries of sound and thriving character, and,\r\nas an instance in point, I may mention that, from what I had heard of\r\ncoffee in Coorg (to which I have devoted a chapter), I should have been\r\nfully prepared, had I not learnt to regard all such reports with\r\nsuspicion, to find a district on the high road to ruin. As it was, I was\r\ncertainly prepared, and, indeed, expected to find, coffee in Coorg in a\r\ndoubtful position. That precisely the reverse proved to be the case was a\r\nmost agreeable surprise to me. One of my informants dismissed the whole\r\nmatter thus. Coffee in Ceylon, he said, has gone with leaf disease, Wynaad\r\n(the district in the Madras Presidency, south of Coorg) is following,\r\nCoorg will go next, and Mysore last. Ceylon certainly has gone, Wynaad I\r\nwill not pronounce upon, as I have not visited the estates in that\r\ndistrict, but that Coorg and Mysore with their shade grown coffee will go\r\nwith leaf disease is a mere groundless assertion, as the reader will, I\r\nhope, admit when I come to treat, in its proper place, of leaf disease and\r\nthe effect of shade in limiting its amount, and controlling its injurious\r\neffects. And so far had these reports gone, and so thoroughly do the\r\npublic at home connect coffee with Ceylon, and Ceylon alone, that a most\r\nthriving Mysore planter told me that, when he visited England, he now took\r\ngood care to conceal his occupation, as he found that when he mentioned he\r\nwas a coffee planter, people concluded at once that he was ruined. It is,\r\nthen, most necessary to lay all the facts connected with coffee in Mysore\r\nbefore the public, with the view of placing our industry in its legitimate\r\nposition, and I therefore make no apology for having gone into this branch\r\nof my subject with considerable minuteness. But it is now time to address\r\nmyself particularly to the history and cultivation of coffee in Mysore,\r\nand to other matters in which the planters are directly or indirectly\r\ninterested, and first of all it may not be uninteresting if I say a few\r\nwords as to the introduction of the plant into India, or at any rate as to\r\nthe earliest notices I can find on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe earliest notice I can find of coffee in India is contained in a Dutch\r\nwork entitled \"Letters from Malabar,\" by Jacob Canter Visscher, chaplain\r\nat Cochin. This collection of letters has been translated by Major Drury,\r\nor rather at his instance, and as the date of the Dutch editor's preface\r\nis 1743, it is evident that the coffee plant must have at least been\r\nintroduced five or six years earlier, but the date of its introduction is\r\nnot mentioned, and we are merely informed, at page 160, that \"the coffee\r\nshrub is planted in gardens for pleasure and yields plenty of fruit, which\r\nattains a proper degree of ripeness. But it has not the refined taste of\r\nthe Mocha coffee.... An entire new plantation has been laid out in\r\nCeylon.\" The plant, however, though introduced at that early period, does\r\nnot seem to have met with much attention in India, and I can find no other\r\nallusion to coffee in Indian books till we come to Heyne's Tracts, which\r\nwere published in 1800, and we are there merely told that coffee was sold\r\nin the bazaars of Bangalore and Seringapatam.\r\n\r\nTurning next to the history of coffee in Mysore, we find that there is no\r\nofficial record of either plant or planting further back than the year\r\n1822, which is not very surprising, as it was only placed under British\r\nrule in 1831; but tradition in these cases seldom fails to supply some\r\nstory which is suitable enough, and it may after all be quite true that,\r\nas reported, a Mussulman pilgrim, about two hundred years ago, returned\r\nfrom Arabia with seven beans which he planted round his mutt (temple) on\r\nthe Bababudan hills in the northern part of Mysore, near which some very\r\nold trees may still be seen, and that from these beans all the coffee in\r\nMysore has descended. But, though the plant may have been introduced at\r\nthis early period, I think it improbable that anything in the shape of\r\nplantations existed before about the close of the last century. And,\r\nthough the plant has been known for such a number of years, it is not a\r\nlittle remarkable that coffee has only come into use by the natives who\r\ngrow it in recent years, and when I first settled in Mysore, in 1856, I\r\nwas repeatedly asked by the farmers of the country whether we ate the\r\nberry, and of what use it could possibly be. And even now, from all that I\r\ncan learn, coffee is rarely used by the natives in the coffee growing\r\ndistricts, though I am informed that it is so to a considerable extent in\r\nthe towns of the province.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the tradition of coffee being first introduced into\r\nMysore by a Mussulman pilgrim about two hundred years ago, and the species\r\nof coffee that was introduced then, or at some subsequent period, was the\r\nonly one known in Mysore when I entered the province in 1855. This plant\r\nwas finally called the \"Chick\" variety of coffee, and the name was taken,\r\nI believe, from the town of Chickmaglur, which lies close to the original\r\nMysore home of the coffee plant. This variety had thriven well and\r\npromised to do so for an indefinite period of time, but towards the end of\r\n1866, and during the three succeeding years, we had dry hot seasons, which\r\ncaused a general attack of the Borer insect, and at about the same time\r\nthere occurred a general decline in the constitution of the trees, which,\r\nthough no doubt greatly hastened in the majority of instances by the\r\nBorer, of which the reader will find a particular account in a subsequent\r\nchapter, has never been explained, and so serious was this decline that,\r\nhad we been dependent wholly on the original Mysore variety, it is the\r\nopinion of one of our most experienced planters that, to use his own\r\nwords, \"there would have been an end of coffee planting in Mysore except\r\nin the case of a few elevated tracts on the Bababudan range of hills.\"\r\nBut, most fortunately for the planters, the Government, and the people of\r\nMysore, Mr. Stanley Jupp--a South Mysore planter--took in 1870 a trip into\r\nCoorg, which lies on the south-west of Mysore, and was so favourably\r\nimpressed with the variety of coffee grown there that he recommended that\r\nexperiments should be made with it in Mysore, and in 1871 experiments on a\r\nconsiderable scale were made with carefully selected seed which was\r\nobtained from Coorg by Messrs. R. A. and Graham Anderson, Mr. Brooke\r\nMockett, and Mr. Arthur Jupp. The experiments turned out to be a\r\nremarkable success, the young plants raised from the imported seed grew\r\nwith extraordinary vigour, and it was soon found that the new variety\r\nwould grow and crop well, and even on land on which all attempts to\r\nreproduce the \"Chick\" variety had utterly failed. Then this sinking\r\nindustry rose almost as suddenly as it had fallen; old and abandoned\r\nestates, and every available acre of forest, and even scrub, were planted\r\nup, and land which used to change hands at from 5 to 10 rupees an acre was\r\neagerly bought in at twelve times these amounts. But there was still some\r\nanxiety felt as regards the new variety, or rather the produce of it, for\r\nwhen we took it to market the brokers at once objected and said, \"We are\r\nnot going to give you Mysore prices for Coorg coffee.\" But it was found,\r\nas had been anticipated by many experienced planters, that as the trees\r\nfrom Coorg seed aged the produce each year assimilated more and more in\r\nappearance and quality to that of the old Mysore plant, which is still\r\ngrown on some estates in North Mysore, and some years ago I even obtained\r\na slightly higher price for my coffee from the new variety than a friend\r\nhad obtained for coffee of the old \"Chick\" kind. The coffee industry of\r\nMysore is now established on a thoroughly sound basis. We have a plant\r\nwhich crops more regularly and heavily than the old variety, and which is\r\nin every respect satisfactory, and the produce of it has so improved under\r\nthe influence of the soil and climate of Mysore, that, with the exception\r\nof the estates which produce the long-established brand of \"Cannon's\r\nMysore,\" and perhaps a few other estates on the Bababudans which have\r\nretained the original \"Chick\" variety of coffee, there is little\r\ndifference in value between the produce of Coorg plants which have been\r\nlong established in Mysore and the coffee of the original and now\r\ngenerally discarded variety. I may here add that the coffee of Mysore has\r\nalways had a high reputation. This high quality has been partly attributed\r\nto soil and climate and partly to the coffee being slowly ripened under\r\nshade. But, however that may be, a glance at the weekly lists in the\r\n\"Economist\" will show that Mysore coffee of the best quality is commonly\r\nvalued at from 10s. to 15s. a cwt. above that of any other kind that\r\nreaches the London market.\r\n\r\nI now propose to give a brief account of our coffee land tenures, and\r\nshall then address myself to the intricate question of coffee cultivation\r\nin Mysore, and the still more difficult question of the shade trees which\r\nshelter the coffee from sun and wind, and the soil from the wash of the\r\ntropical rains.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the province in 1855 anyone who desired to have a given\r\ntract of forest land for coffee planting sent an application to the\r\nGovernment for it. An inquiry was then made, and, if no objection existed\r\nto the land being made over to the intending settler, or applicant, a\r\nputtah or grant, free of any charge for the land or any fee even in\r\nconnection with the grant, was made out in Kanarese, which mentioned the\r\nname of the land and the boundaries of it, and stated that the land was to\r\nbe planted with coffee within three years' time, and that, if not so\r\nplanted, it was liable to be resumed by the State. No survey was made of\r\nthe land, nor was it of any importance to estimate the acreage, there\r\nbeing no land tax, but in its place a tax of 1 rupee per cwt. of clean\r\ncoffee produced, which was only liable to be demanded when the coffee was\r\nexported from the country, and not before. This system may seem to many to\r\nhave been an objectionable one, and, from one point of view, no doubt it\r\nwas, because the more highly the planter cultivated, the more highly he\r\npaid on each acre of his holding, but, on the other hand, the system\r\nenabled the planter to start with a very small capital, as he paid nothing\r\nfor his land, nor a single shilling to the State till he had produced his\r\ncrop. For starting and stimulating the industry the system certainly had\r\nits merits; but after the industry had obtained a firm footing, it was\r\nevidently of advantage to institute a taxational system of a different\r\ncharacter, and, after much discussion and correspondence on the subject,\r\nthe existing forms of tenure were finally decided on, and the \"Mysore\r\nCoffee Land Rules\" were formally notified to the public in March, 1885.\r\nThere are two forms of grant--Form A, with an assessment of one rupee and\r\na half an acre, which rate is fixed permanently, and Form B, at one rupee\r\nper acre, with liability to revision at the end of each period of thirty\r\nyears. The assessment for local purposes stands now at 1 anna an acre\r\n(1-1/2d. at 2s. exchange), and that is the only taxation we have. There\r\nis not, and never has been, an income-tax in Mysore, nor is it at all\r\nprobable that there ever will be, as the finances are in a flourishing\r\ncondition, and the revenues under several important heads are improving,\r\nas may be seen on referring to the chapter on the general history of the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThose who desire further and more detailed information regarding the rules\r\nin question, may be referred to the notification of March 24th, 1855, and\r\nI may mention that they are given in full in the \"Mysore and Coorg\r\nDirectory.\"[51]\r\n\r\nI regret that I have no precise information to give as regards the\r\nimplanted coffee land in Mysore. With reference to the southern part of\r\nthe province, I think I am quite safe in saying that all the land suitable\r\nfor coffee has been taken up, but I am informed by a correspondent who\r\nresides in the northern part of the province, that in that part of the\r\ncountry there is much implanted land both in the possession of the\r\nGovernment and in the hands of private individuals. All along the sides of\r\nthe western passes there are indeed large blocks of forest, but these,\r\nfrom the excessive rainfall, are quite unsuitable for coffee, as I am able\r\nto testify from an unfortunate practical experience, as I once took up\r\nland for coffee on the crests of the Ghauts. After its failure had been\r\ncompletely proved I sold the land to a planter who has since cultivated\r\ncardamoms on it, and last year the rainfall registered there was no less\r\nthan 340 inches, nearly all of which fell between May and the end of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nFrom what has hitherto been written as regards our taxation, I need hardly\r\nsay that the planters are well satisfied with the terms granted to them by\r\nthe Government. With the roads, post, telegraphs, railways, dispensaries,\r\nand other facilities at their command, and the prospect of a further\r\nimportant development of communications, they have also every reason to be\r\nsatisfied. In short, the progressive character of the Government would\r\nseem to leave nothing to be desired. There is, however, always a \"but\" in\r\nlife, and in our case there are two \"buts.\" The first of these relates to\r\nthe state of the law as regards advances given to labourers to be worked\r\noff by them, and to contractors to bring labourers; and the second to\r\nextradition. To these may be added three wants--I can hardly call them\r\ngrievances--the want of a Wild Birds' Protection Act, a Game Act, and an\r\nagricultural chemist. On these five points I now propose briefly to\r\nremark.\r\n\r\nThe practice of giving money advances to labourers to be gradually worked\r\noff by them, and to contractors who undertake to supply labourers, has\r\nbeen productive of great loss and annoyance to employers, a great\r\ntemptation to natives to commit fraud, and a source of constant worry to\r\nthe officers of the Government. The Government sought by Act XIII. of 1859\r\nto check these evils, not by preventive, but purely by punitive\r\nlegislation. Since then there has been a constant demand by employers of\r\nlabour for more punitive legislation in the shape of amendments to the Act\r\nof 1859, and from recent assurances made by the Viceroy when he visited\r\nMysore in 1892, it seems probable that something further will be done on\r\nthe same lines. And something may of course be done to insure that the\r\ndefaulter shall be severely dealt with--when he is caught. When he is\r\ncaught. Yes, therein lies the whole difficulty, one which seems to have\r\nbeen as completely ignored by the Government as it has been by the\r\nplanters in the legislation adopted with a view to check the evils\r\nconnected with advances. In order to prove the necessity for further\r\nlegislation an old planter once printed an account of a case which he took\r\nup against a defaulting coolie. His description of the hunt, and the wiles\r\nof the defaulting labourer in moving from one part of the country to\r\nanother, was positively amusing, and showed conclusively that it did not\r\npay to attempt to catch a defaulting labourer. What, then, can be the use\r\nof an Act which after all only punishes the coolie when he is caught, if\r\nthe trouble and expense involved in catching him be so great, as to make\r\nthe game not worth the candle? Is it not evident that the only thing which\r\ncan help the planter is legislation which will make it very difficult for\r\nthe labourer to obtain money from one employer and then run away and take\r\nan advance from another, and which will make it a comparatively easy\r\nmatter to trace a defaulter? Now, after conferring with experienced\r\nplanters and some leading native officials, I came to the conclusion that\r\na system of registration could alone mitigate the serious evils of the\r\nadvance system, and in conjunction with them I drew up a draft of a\r\nproposed Act which I laid on the table for the consideration of the Mysore\r\nGovernment when I attended the Representative Assembly in 1891, and I may\r\nmention that the draft in question has been printed in the Government\r\nReport of the Proceedings. It would be tedious to give an account of the\r\nprovisions in the Bill, and it is sufficient to say that its two chief\r\nfeatures were the registration of advances and the limitation of their\r\namount. The registration was to be effected by its being made compulsory\r\nthat when an advance was given three tickets on a Government form should\r\nbe issued, one of which was to be held by the employer, the second by the\r\nlabourer, and the third by the registrar of the talook. On each ticket was\r\nto be entered the name and address of the advancee, and the sum advanced,\r\nand as this was paid off the amounts so discharged were to be entered by\r\nthe employer on the ticket retained by the labourer. When the whole amount\r\nwas repaid, the ticket retained by the employer was to be handed to the\r\nregistrar, who was then to erase the name of the labourer from the\r\nregister of coolies under advances, and before any advance was handed to\r\nthe labourer the registry was of course to be effected. The amount of\r\nadvance was to be limited to ten rupees, and this was to be worked off in\r\nfive months unless in the case of sickness. The object of limiting\r\nadvances is as much in the interest of the labourer as of the employer, as\r\nit has been found that native employers of labour often give large\r\nadvances to labourers and charge heavy interest on them when the coolie\r\ndoes not come to work, and thus so effectually get him into debt that he\r\nis reduced to the position of a slave. This system of registration would\r\nno doubt be troublesome, but it is the only way of checking the present\r\nevil system of giving advances which, now that labour is so well paid, is\r\nnot really necessary, and that it is not so is evidenced by the fact that\r\nthe large bodies of labourers employed in the gold mines receive no\r\nadvances whatever. I may here mention that a private system of\r\nregistration with reference to labour contractors has been started by the\r\nfirm of Messrs. Matheson and Co., in connection with their extensive\r\nestates in Coorg, and that it has been found most useful. The system I\r\nhave proposed would be valuable to the contractors, who themselves are\r\noften swindled by labourers to whom they have advanced money.\r\n\r\nI now turn to the subject of extradition, the law relating to which has\r\nmuch aggravated the evils connected with giving advances to labourers. The\r\nwant of legislation on this subject has been brought to the notice of the\r\nViceroy, and it is to be hoped that there may soon be complete reciprocity\r\nbetween native States and the British Government as regards warrants. At\r\npresent a defaulter flying from Mysore to British territory can only be\r\narrested by calling in the interposition of the Resident, a process so\r\ncumbrous that it is practically true, as alleged in the petition of the\r\nplanters of Southern India, that \"Planters or contractors residing in\r\nMysore cannot obtain warrants against defaulters in British territory,\r\nthough planters in British territory can obtain warrants against\r\ndefaulters in Mysore.\" This is a grievance which requires redress, not\r\nonly for the sake of the planters, but also of all other employers of\r\nlabourers, or those who may have made contracts of any kind.\r\n\r\nCattle trespass, I may mention, is not here alluded to because, though it\r\nwas at one time a great grievance, a Cattle Trespass Amendment Act\r\nreceived the assent of His Highness the Maharajah in December, 1892. By\r\nthis, where it is proved to the satisfaction of Government that in any\r\ngiven local area cattle are habitually allowed to trespass on land and\r\ndamage crops, the fines will be doubled, and the owner of the land has\r\nbesides the right to bring an action for compensation for any damage done\r\nto his land or crops.\r\n\r\nHaving alluded to our grievances, I now pass on to consider lastly what\r\nmay be called our wants as regards wild birds' protection, game\r\npreservation, and a Government agricultural chemist.\r\n\r\nA Wild Birds' Protection Act exists in British India, but as its\r\nprovisions have not as yet been extended to our province, I would suggest\r\nthat Mysore, in consequence of its numerous plantations where coffee and\r\nother plants and trees are liable to be attacked by insects, probably\r\nrequires such an Act even more than any other part of India, and I may at\r\nthe same time take the opportunity of suggesting that all the native\r\nStates should be communicated with so that an Act for the Protection of\r\nWild Birds may be provided for every part of India. It would be\r\nsuperfluous to adduce here the numerous and evident advantages that would\r\narise from the protection of wild birds, as their value is now so\r\nuniversally recognized, and I therefore pass on to offer a few brief\r\nremarks on game preservation, or, to speak more exactly, of the\r\npreservation of those wild birds and harmless animals which are useful as\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe neglect of game preservation in India has not only been a cause of\r\ngreat loss to the country owing to the reckless waste of the sources of\r\nvaluable supplies of food, but has severely injured the farmers in jungly\r\ntracts in a way that seems hitherto to have escaped notice. I allude to\r\nthe fact that, in consequence of the wanton destruction of game in the\r\nwestern forests, tigers are compelled to inflict much greater losses on\r\nthe herds of the natives. This is a fact to which I can personally\r\ntestify, and which has since the middle of 1892 become steadily more\r\napparent; for, when game was more plentiful in the forests along the\r\ncrests, and at the foot of the Ghauts, the tigers lived largely upon game\r\nand rarely attacked cattle; indeed, so much was this the case that, about\r\nthirty years ago, a native who had the most outlying farm on the crests of\r\nthe Ghauts told me that though tigers were constantly about they had never\r\nattacked his cattle. And as I was at the time living near his house, and\r\nclearing land for planting, and never got a shot at a tiger when residing\r\nthere, I am sure that his statement was correct. But since that time\r\nEnglish guns have become common, and the destruction of game of all kinds\r\nand of any age has gone on apace, and the result is that the tigers, which\r\nused to confine themselves mainly to preying on wild animals in the\r\nforests, have been forced to fall upon the village cattle, and I have\r\nnever known tigers to be more destructive than they are now. On a single\r\nday this year no less than seven cattle were killed by tigers at one\r\nvillage, and an old planter of more than thirty years' standing, a near\r\nneighbour of mine, alluding to the subject in a recent letter, said, \"Yes,\r\nthere have been more tigers about this year than I have ever known.\" But\r\nit is not only on account of the supply of food from game, and for the\r\nsake of the cattle of the natives that a Game Preservation Act is urgently\r\nrequired, it is also urgently needed in order to check the abominable\r\ncruelties committed by the native hunters. Writing to me with reference to\r\nthis subject, Colonel J. P. Grant, the head of the Survey and Settlement\r\nService, observes as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Gunning and especially netting, in the most reckless and improvident\r\nmanner, are on the increase. Antelope are fast disappearing, and in the\r\njungle tracts night shooting is clearing out spotted deer especially. As\r\nfor cruelty nothing can exceed the indifference of net-workers to any pain\r\nthey may cause their captures. Snipe are caught and their legs and wings\r\nbroken, and in this condition they are kept alive and carried to market.\r\nThe wounding, necessarily reckless during night shooting, is horribly\r\ncruel. Pea fowl, jungle fowl, or anything fairly big, have their eyes sewn\r\nup. I have often seen this. In the case of hares the tying is very cruel,\r\nthe thong cutting down to the bone; and the same is the case with any deer\r\nthey may catch alive.\"\r\n\r\nThe rapid destruction of game of all kinds has been as melancholy as it\r\nhas been remarkable, and I confess I never could have believed how\r\ncomplete, especially as regards small game, the deadly work has been had I\r\nnot had occasion in recent years to drive, by easy stages, and early in\r\nthe morning, along the whole of the western frontier of Mysore, and also\r\nmuch of the adjacent district of Coorg. In the old days, when riding, we\r\nalways went at a walk and took our guns with us for shots at pea fowl,\r\njungle fowl, pigeons, and other small game. But now you can neither see\r\nnor hear anything to shoot. And yet one of the favourite accusations of\r\nthe Indian Congress against the Indian Government is that in consequence\r\nof the Arms Act the natives are unable to obtain guns and ammunition in\r\norder to defend themselves and their crops from the attacks of wild\r\nanimals, though the scarcity of large game, and, in many cases, its\r\nabsolute extinction, is notorious to sportsmen all over India. But the\r\nMysore Government, I am happy to say, has at last directed its attention\r\nto the subject, and I have every reason to believe that a Game Act will\r\nsoon be introduced in Mysore.\r\n\r\nThe last want I have to allude to is that of a Government agricultural\r\nchemist, who should be empowered at a rate of fees, fixed by the State, to\r\nanalyze soils and manures for private individuals, and to consult with\r\nplanters and others as to the requirements of their soils and the best way\r\nof supplying them with manure. Such an officer would be very useful in\r\nsearching for coprolites and new manurial resources. My life-long\r\nexperience in agriculture on a large scale both in Scotland and Mysore has\r\nshown me more and more the great value of an agricultural chemist for\r\ndiscovering new manurial resources, and perhaps more especially\r\neconomizing those that already exist; and the great want of such an\r\nofficer was brought to the notice of Government by me when I was a member\r\nof the Representative Assembly in 1891.\r\n\r\nI may conclude this chapter by alluding to a discovery, or rather, I\r\nshould say, a probable discovery, of the greatest importance, of a new\r\nhybrid coffee plant--a cross between the Liberian and the coffea Arabica.\r\nThis has occurred on the property of a friend of mine, but, at his\r\nrequest, I do not publish his name, as he would be inundated with\r\napplications for seed. This magnificent hybrid, of which there are only\r\ntwo trees in existence as yet, has enormous bearing powers, and leaves\r\nwhich are apparently absolutely impervious to leaf disease, for I could\r\nnot discover a trace of it though the hybrid is standing next to a coffee\r\nplant which is covered with it. It is of course uncertain as yet whether\r\nthe new plant can be established as a distinct variety, nor do we know\r\nanything of the flavour of the coffee, as the quantity produced is yet so\r\nsmall that berries are reserved exclusively for seed; but should it be\r\npossible to establish the new variety (and I know of no reason why it\r\nshould not be established), quite a new departure will take place in\r\ncoffee production in India, and the value of coffee land will be enormous,\r\nas, from calculations made, the hybrid can produce at the rate of eight or\r\nnine tons an acre, while as many hundredweights an acre would be\r\nconsidered an unusually heavy crop in Mysore.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[51] \"Hayes' Mysore and Coorg Directory,\" Bangalore. This valuable\r\ncompilation, which contains no less than 573 pages, gives a most complete\r\naccount of almost everything relating to Mysore and Coorg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSHADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now turn to the greatest of all the points connected with coffee--the\r\nquestion of shade. And I call it the greatest point, because if good shade\r\nof the best kind is grown it is absolutely impossible to destroy a\r\nplantation in Mysore, even with the worst conceivable management or\r\nneglect, and I say this after ample experience, as had it not been for the\r\nabundant and excellent shade on a badly-managed property of my own it\r\nwould have been permanently ruined. But with plenty of good kinds of shade\r\ntrees on the land you might even close the plantation gates, and abandon\r\nthe land, and, as long as cattle were kept out, return ten years\r\nafterwards, saw down the coffee, grow suckers from the stumps, plant up\r\nthe land with young plants where vacancies had occurred, and in four or\r\nfive years the plantation would be as good as ever, and the land even\r\nbetter, for it would not have been exhausted by crop, and the fallen\r\nleaves from the shade trees would have enriched the soil. And if the old\r\ntrees were not in a condition, from old age, to grow suckers that would\r\ndevelop into good trees, the whole land could be advantageously replanted.\r\nBut, as the reader will remember, I have said that the trees must be the\r\nbest kinds of shade trees, a subject that requires great study and\r\nobservation to master. Before beginning, however, it may be well to point\r\nout those general principles which govern the whole subject, and which at\r\nonce show us the best kinds of trees to select, and what is nearly of as\r\ngreat importance, how to manage them after they have been selected or\r\nplanted, and I would lay particular stress on the latter point, which has,\r\nI may observe, been largely if not entirely misunderstood, simply because\r\nthe great governing principle has been neglected.\r\n\r\nThe governing principle, then, as regards shade for coffee is, that you\r\nshould have on the land the smallest number of boles, because the more you\r\nmultiply boles the more ground you waste; and the greater the number of\r\nlarge trees there are, the greater, of course, will be the number of large\r\nroots in the land, and the greater demand will there be on the resources\r\nof the soil; the greater, too, will be the waste of manure put down by the\r\nplanter for the benefit of his coffee; and last, but by no means least,\r\nthe smaller will be the amount of leaf deposit. I have seen much shade so\r\nmanaged as to give the greatest amount of boles with the smallest amount,\r\nand spread of branches, whereas the object of the planter ought to be to\r\nfurnish the smallest number of boles with the greatest proportionate\r\namount and spread of branches and foliage. And this unfortunate error, the\r\nevil of which will become more and more apparent as time advances, would\r\nnever have been committed, had the primary principle I have pointed out\r\nbeen grasped at the outset.\r\n\r\nLet us then keep firmly in mind that, (1) we require trees that will, from\r\ntheir wide-spreading branches, enable us to do with the smallest number\r\npossible on the land, and that (2) if we trim up the lower branches of\r\nthese trees when the trees are young because we do not like to see them\r\ntoo closely over the coffee, we shall entirely defeat the main object we\r\nhave in view, because we shall certainly produce a tall tree with a small\r\nhead, and consequently small spread of branches; and the clear\r\napprehension of the principle first named guides us at once to the\r\nselection of the right kind of trees, and their proper treatment. I will\r\nnow proceed to state the names of the trees that are, in my experience,\r\nthe most desirable, and, secondly, those which are good for coffee, but\r\nwhich for various reasons are undesirable. After much and close study of\r\nthis important subject, and a very long experience, I have come to the\r\nconclusion that the only trees which are at once easily propagated; free\r\nfrom the risks of attacks from cattle owing to their being grown from long\r\ncuttings; little liable to attacks from parasites, and which afford a\r\nproper degree of shade, and also admit the largest relative supply of\r\nlight; which afford a large supply of leaf deposit; and which lastly, but\r\nby no means leastly, have very wide spreading branches, are only five in\r\nnumber. I give first the Kanarese and then the botanical name of each.\r\nThere are, then, Cub Busree (_Ficus tuberculata_), the Gonee (_Ficus\r\nMysorensis_), the Kurry Busree (_Ficus infectoria_), Eelee Busree (a\r\nvariety of the last named), and Mitlee.[52]\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds, Heb Mitlee, and Harl Mitlee--the second is a bad\r\ntree. The mitlee grows one fourth quicker than cub busree, and a recent\r\nclose attention to this tree shows me that it is a much more desirable\r\ntree than either others or myself once supposed, for not only is it a\r\nquicker grower than the remainder of the most desirable kinds but its\r\nfoliage lets in much light. It is, therefore, a most desirable tree for\r\nnorthern aspects.\r\n\r\nI next turn to a class of trees which are undoubtedly good for coffee, but\r\nwhich, for various reasons to be hereafter given, are less desirable than\r\nthe five trees first given. The first of these less desirable trees is\r\nthe Jack--Halsen-Mara (_Artocarpus integrifolia_), which was once a\r\nfavourite tree, and there can be no doubt that coffee thrives well under\r\nit, but it is not a wide-spreading tree, the shade is too dense for every\r\naspect, it is a slow grower, and it must be raised from young plants,\r\nwhich are very liable to be attacked by stray cattle. Then when old, and\r\nsometimes of medium age, it is very liable to be attacked by parasites;\r\nand it produces annually a heavy[53] crop of fruit which costs money and\r\ntrouble to remove when immature, and which, if left to ripen, exhausts the\r\nsoil. It is, too, liable to suffer much from wind, and, in situations\r\nwhich are at all windy, is not much to be relied on, as, when under the\r\ninfluence of wind, the foliage becomes poor and scanty, and the tree\r\nsometimes dies altogether. A study of the foliage will show, that in one\r\nimportant particular, the five first-named trees are superior to jack, for\r\ntheir leaves are attached to the twigs by long stalks, and much light is\r\nthus admitted through the spaces between the stalks, while the leaves of\r\nthe jack are not only more numerous but are attached by short stalks, and\r\nthe foliage thus throws a very dark shade. Then jack, as it is an\r\nevergreen, always affords a thick shade quite continuously, while the five\r\nfirst-named trees not only cast a chequered shade, but, at certain periods\r\nof the year, shed every leaf, leaving the tree quite bare for some time,\r\nwhich is an advantage to the coffee. And besides, I have some reason to\r\nsuppose that the dense shade of the jack encourages rot (a disease\r\nremarked upon further on), as one of my managers reports that he has\r\nobserved it under jack while it was not apparent on the coffee under other\r\nkinds of shade trees. But on hot westerly and southerly slopes, and\r\nespecially where the soil is a bad retainer of moisture, and where the\r\ngradient is rather steep, jack may be used with advantage, as in such\r\nsituations the heat is great and the light strong. I am therefore taking\r\nsteps to remove jack by degrees from all but southerly and westerly\r\nexposures. I may add here that I have found that plants grown from seed\r\nprocured from the dry plains of the interior of Mysore, grow more than\r\ntwice as fast as plants raised from local seed. In concluding my remarks\r\non jack, I would particularly advise planters to remove the jack fruit\r\nwhen immature, and put it into the manure heap, or bury it, as, if left on\r\nthe ground, it attracts cattle and village pigs into the plantation. The\r\nfruit is large and full of a great number of seeds which must be an\r\nexhaustive crop on the land. On the Nilgiri hills I am told by the\r\nplanters that there is a ready sale for jack fruit, but this is not the\r\ncase in coffee districts generally.\r\n\r\nThe Attí (_Ficus glomerata_) was with me once a favourite tree, and is\r\ngenerally considered to be a good one, as it affords a cool and desirable\r\nshade. As a young tree it is admirable, but as it ages the foliage becomes\r\npoor and scanty, and the tree has a tendency to run too much to thick\r\nbole, and thick branches, which are poorly supplied with smaller branches\r\nand foliage. When about thirty years old, I have generally found this tree\r\nto be a poor shader, but it can be much improved by severe pruning, or\r\nrather lopping. When thinning out shade on this estate about twenty years\r\nago, a twelve year old tree had every branch removed preparatory to\r\ncutting down, but by some accident the tree was left standing, and the\r\nstumps of the branches threw out fresh shoots, and the tree is now\r\nflourishing, and has a comparatively wide spread of branches and fair\r\namount of foliage. It is evident, then, that pruning heavily will cause\r\nthe tree to throw out new and vigorous shoots, but as this is a\r\ntroublesome and expensive work, and as attí is certainly liable to the\r\ndefect above alluded to, and is, besides, not a wide-spreading tree, it is\r\nevidently not so desirable as any of the first five I have named. Attí can\r\nbe grown from cuttings, but these must not be large ones, i.e., they\r\nshould be thinner than those commonly used when planting cuttings of the\r\nvarious fig trees recommended at the beginning of the section on shade.\r\n\r\nThe Noga (so called from its being much used to make bullock yokes from)\r\nor Nogurigay (_Cedrela Microcarpa_) is a favourite tree to plant for\r\nshade, as it is a quick grower, and cattle do not eat it, and it has been\r\nextensively planted in Mysore and Coorg. The shade is fairly good, but the\r\ntree is not a wide spreader. Then it has one very great objection owing to\r\nits being so peculiarly liable, when about thirty years old, to be\r\nseverely attacked, and often killed, by parasites, and as it is so liable\r\nto be attacked, and therefore supplies a large quantity of parasite seed,\r\nthe tree is the means of spreading these parasites to other shade trees. I\r\nhave found that if you even remove every branch that is attacked, and\r\nquite below each parasite, the parasite will spring out again, and even\r\nmore vigorously than before. In short, I found it impossible to contend\r\nwith the parasites, and am ordering the removal of all Nogurigays from my\r\nplantations. I may add here that when jack is lopped in order to remove\r\nparasites, they do not spring out again in the same way. My head duffadar\r\ninforms me that the reason why Nogurigays are so liable to parasites is on\r\naccount of the rough, deeply-fissured bark, which retains the parasite\r\nseeds dropped by birds, whereas smooth-barked trees, like the first five\r\nnamed, of course do not retain them, and hence you rarely see parasites on\r\nsmooth-barked trees. Another objection to this tree is that, from its\r\nshedding its leaves in the monsoon, and not growing them again till we are\r\nliable to have hot bursts of sun, you may have a thoroughly saturated soil\r\nexposed to a hot sun, which of course has the effect of rapidly hardening\r\nthe soil. A neighbouring planter tells me that he finds the Noga tree\r\nliable to attacks from parasites at even ten years old, and that he\r\ntherefore regards the tree as a temporary shade, i.e., as a shade to be\r\nremoved after other more desirable trees are ready to take their place.\r\n\r\nSince writing this chapter I have again paid particular attention to this\r\ntree, and have been struck with the fact that, for some unknown reason,\r\nsome trees of this variety seem to be much more liable to attacks of\r\nparasites than others, while some escape altogether. But it is quite clear\r\nto me that, generally speaking, this tree is not to be relied on, and I\r\nhave, therefore, no hesitation in advising planters who have relied on it\r\nas a permanent shade to at once put down trees of the desirable kind first\r\ngiven with the view of gradually removing the Nogurigays.\r\n\r\nMullee Geruguttee. A very thick, tall tree with large buttresses. Coffee\r\nthrives well under this tree, but it is not a wide spreader, and, when\r\nold, the foliage becomes poor. It is evident that a tree of great\r\nthickness which is not a wide spreader, takes up an immense deal of room\r\nin proportion to the shade that it yields, and this tree is therefore not\r\nso desirable as any of the first five species I have given as being the\r\nmost desirable trees.\r\n\r\nHowligay (_Acrocarpus Flaxinifolia_). This tree has been largely planted\r\nin Mysore for shade, but no one speaks well of it now. We have some on my\r\nestate upwards of thirty years old, and the foliage is poor and scanty.\r\nThe trees, too, shoot up to a great height, and spread but little. By\r\ntopping at a certain height, this defect may be remedied to some extent,\r\nbut in order to get an efficient shade from this tree you would require to\r\nplant it thickly, and would thus have a large proportion of stems and\r\nroots in the land. This tree, though not injurious to coffee, is certainly\r\nvery undesirable as compared with the first-named kinds I have given.\r\nSome years ago two of these trees died on my property, and all the coffee\r\ndied around them.\r\n\r\nHessan (_Artocarpus Hirsuta_). Though said to be injurious in poor and\r\nshallow soil, coffee thrives under it in good land, but it has a tendency\r\neverywhere to run to stem, and therefore affords poor shade. An occasional\r\ntree branches out, and affords fair, and in some cases, even good shade,\r\nbut, as a rule, this is not a desirable tree. It spreads little and thus\r\ngives but a poor return for the space taken up by its stem and roots.\r\n\r\nNairul (_Eugenia Jambolana_). This is a good shade tree. Coffee thrives\r\nwell under it, and wherever it exists, or may have sprung up accidentally\r\nin the plantation, it should be preserved, but it is not, I consider, a\r\ndesirable tree to plant, as it is a slow grower and not a wide spreader.\r\n\r\nWartee. This is a tree we have always preserved, but it is a slow growing\r\ntree, not at all a wide spreader, and the leaf deposit from it is not of a\r\nvaluable quality, and it is, therefore, not a desirable tree to plant.\r\n\r\nGwoddan (_Dolichos fabaeformis_). Coffee thrives well under this tree, but\r\nit has a great profusion of very hard fruits or seeds about the size of a\r\nsmall plum, and these, when falling from a high tree, injure the coffee\r\nberries, as may be readily supposed; the tree, too, is not a wide\r\nspreader. It is, therefore, not a desirable tree to plant.\r\n\r\nI may mention here that I have recently obtained a supply of seed of\r\n_Albizzia Moluccana_, which is the tree most approved of for shading\r\ncoffee in the Island of Java, and I am informed by the superintendent of\r\nthe Agri-Horticultural Society's Gardens, Madras (from whom I obtained the\r\nseed), that one of their correspondents who tried it some years ago\r\nreports that, \"It grows rapidly, and is of great utility in putting a\r\nfield of coffee under a light shade such as coffee likes,\" and that, \"in\r\nfour years the _Albizzia Moluccana_, planted thirty feet apart, will cover\r\nthe coffee trees.\" The leaves close during the night, thus giving the\r\ncoffee plants the benefit of the moonlight and dew more freely. Each ounce\r\nof the seed contains roughly 1,200 seeds, which, with ordinary care,\r\nshould give 1,000 plants, and which, when planted out thirty feet apart,\r\nshould shade twenty acres.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to consider the methods that are adopted for planting under\r\nshade in Mysore. The first is to clear down and burn the entire forest,\r\nand then plant shade trees along with the coffee. The second is to clear\r\nand burn the underwood, and a certain portion of the forest trees, leaving\r\nthe remainder for shade, and the third is (a system which I have myself\r\nadopted in the case of land lying in ravines) to clear off and burn the\r\nentire underwood and trees of the lower part of the ravines, leaving the\r\nupper portions of them, and the remainder of the land to be cleared and\r\nplanted, under the original forest trees, as in the second method\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the first-named method is the easiest. I am\r\naware that it has been adopted by some very experienced planters, and it\r\nhas been partially adopted by myself in the case of all my land in the\r\nlower part of ravines. I am well able to judge of the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of both systems, as I have them under observation and\r\ntreatment side by side. On the whole, I think there can be no doubt that\r\nthe balance of advantage lies much in favour of land that has not had the\r\nforest cleared wholly and burnt off. It is true that by a wholesale\r\nclearance you at once kill the vast mass of live forest tree roots in the\r\nland, but, on the other hand, you at the same time destroy a store of\r\nslowly-decaying vegetable matter, which is of vast importance, not only in\r\nfeeding the coffee, but in maintaining the physical condition of the soil,\r\nand so making it more, easily, and therefore cheaply, workable, and a\r\nbetter agent for preserving the health of the tree. And as a proof of the\r\nactual loss incurred, I may observe that Colonel C. I. Taylor, in his book\r\non \"The Borer in Coorg, Munzerabad and Nuggar,\" mentions that an iron peg\r\ndriven into the ground so that not a part of it protruded, was found,\r\nafter the cleared jungle had been burned, to be no less than six inches\r\nout of the ground. There seems to be a general opinion too that land that\r\nhas not been burnt will last far longer, and one experienced planter, Mr.\r\nBrooke Mockett, attributes the circumstances of all the most ancient\r\nestates in Mysore being still in existence to the fact that the land has\r\nnever been burnt. Mr. Mockett also informs me that in good land, where\r\nthere has been no burn, he has never had Borer severely, though for a time\r\nthere was no shade over it, as he cleared down ultimately all the old\r\nforest trees that had been left for shade, and planted fresh shade. I may\r\nmention, too, that I was lately shown an estate in Coorg which had been\r\npartially cleared down and burnt off, and partly planted under the shade\r\nof the old forest trees. In the latter case the plants had never suffered\r\nfrom Borer or leaf disease and were always healthy, while the coffee in\r\nthe former case had suffered from both, and there was certainly a most\r\nmarked difference perceptible in favour of the coffee planted in the\r\nunburnt land.\r\n\r\nThere is also a great difference in my own property in favour of the\r\ncoffee planted under the original forest shade as compared with the coffee\r\non the land that was cleared down and burnt off, notwithstanding that in\r\nthe latter case the most approved kinds of shade trees were afterwards\r\nplanted, and that the land is now admirably shaded. It is highly important\r\nto notice these facts, both as a guide to those who have land to open, and\r\nalso as regards the value of any property that may be for sale, for, after\r\nwhat I have mentioned, it is clear that a property planted under original\r\nforest shade, where the land has not been burnt off (for it is quite\r\npossible gradually to remove all the old forest trees and replace them\r\nwith newly planted shade), must be much more valuable than one where the\r\nentire forest has been cleared down and burnt off. I now proceed to remark\r\n(1) on the course that should be pursued in the case of clearing down and\r\nburning the whole jungle and planting fresh shade, and (2) when planting\r\nunder the original shade.\r\n\r\nAfter the land is ready for planting the coffee, and as early as possible\r\nin the monsoon, the young shade trees should be planted in lines or\r\navenues running from east to west, and the trees should be planted so\r\nclose that they may in five or six years touch each other, and thus form\r\nwhat looks like a series of hedges in parallel lines. The object of this\r\nformation is that as the declination of the sun is southerly during our\r\nnon-cloudy or clear sky season, a close shadow may be cast from the south\r\nto the north, so that the spaces between the lines may have a lateral\r\nshade cast on them. When the trees begin to crowd each other every other\r\none should of course be taken, out, and this may be repeated a second time\r\nif necessary. But, besides the southerly, we have also to consider the hot\r\nwesterly sun, which will strike down the avenues from, say, between two\r\nand four in the afternoon. This it is important to block out with\r\noccasional trees planted in the avenue, but it is only, of course, where\r\nthe land is exposed to the afternoon sun that the avenues should be\r\nblocked with occasional trees. After fully considering the subject, I find\r\nit impossible to say even approximately at what distance the lines of\r\ntrees should be planted, on account of the great variety in the gradients,\r\nand the planter must here use his own judgment; and I can only say\r\ngenerally that the lines of trees require to be much nearer each other on\r\na southerly than on a northerly aspect; nearly as close on a westerly\r\naspect as on a southerly; and on an easterly aspect, at a closer distance\r\nthan on a northerly one. Some guide toward the nearness of these lines\r\nwill afterwards be found in the remarks on the quantity of shade required\r\nfor the various aspects.\r\n\r\nAfter having planted the young shade trees, then, there comes the question\r\nof providing shade for them, for without it their growth will be very\r\nslow, and the planter would have to wait a great many years before\r\nobtaining such an amount of shade as would have an effect in lowering the\r\ntemperature of the plantation. He requires then some quick-growing tree as\r\na nurse for the good caste shade trees, and the only tree I know of that\r\nis suitable for this purpose is the quick-growing charcoal tree (_Sponia\r\nWightii_)--Kanarese, _gorkul mara_--which springs up with the first rain\r\nafter the forest has been cleared and burnt. Planters, I am aware, have,\r\ngenerally speaking, a great objection to this tree, and it is considered\r\nby Mr. Graham Anderson (_vide_ his book previously quoted) as being\r\n\"generally regarded as prejudicial and useless.\" This conclusion has\r\nprobably arisen from the fact that it is certainly a bad thing to have a\r\nrapid grower, and therefore a greedy feeder on the land, and hence it has\r\nbeen found that the charcoal tree is bad when young. But when it has\r\nattained its full height, which in ordinary circumstances is about thirty\r\nfeet (I have one specimen on my property about sixty feet high, the only\r\none of such a size I ever saw), coffee thrives well under it. This I found\r\nto be the case on plantations on the slopes of the Nilgiri hills, where a\r\nvery experienced planter told me that the tree was bad when young for\r\ncoffee, but not so when old; and I there saw coffee thriving well under\r\nthe shade of old charcoal trees. On my oldest plantation we only preserved\r\none of the species (all the others having been cut down, as their good\r\noffices as nurses to better trees were no longer required), and the coffee\r\nalways throve under it remarkably well. Where, too, the shade has\r\nsubsequently become deficient we always plant charcoal as a nurse for the\r\nmore desirable trees, and have never observed that it is injurious to\r\ncoffee. On the whole, after a very long experience and observation of this\r\ntree, I have no hesitation in recommending it as a nurse to be thinly\r\ndistributed amongst the newly-planted shade trees. It is, I may observe,\r\ntoo, a tree with very light branches, which, of course, can easily be\r\nremoved without injury to the coffee, and its branches should be thinned\r\naway when they crowd the young shade trees, and when these have been\r\nsufficiently drawn up and expanded the charcoal tree should be entirely\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent treatment of the shade trees is of great importance. Their\r\nlower branches in the early years of their growth are commonly thin and\r\nweakly, and thus, of course, droop close over the coffee, and often touch\r\nit. Then the inexperienced shade tree grower begins to lop off the lower\r\nbranches, with the result that he injures and bleeds the young tree, and\r\ndeprives it of the nutriment it would otherwise derive from its full\r\nallowance of foliage. Some carry this trimming up to a very injurious\r\nextent, and the result is that they grow young trees with long stems and\r\npoor foliage, and a narrow spread of branches, and thus require many more\r\ntrees in the land than they would if they exercised a little more patience\r\nat first. But if the tree is only left alone the evil of branches drooping\r\ndownwards on to the coffee will soon disappear, as these branches will not\r\nonly rise with the rising stem, but will thicken and grow upwards, instead\r\nof drooping as they did when young and weakly. And some planters, I\r\nobserve, are by no means satisfied with lopping the lower boughs, but trim\r\noff branches fifteen feet from the ground. Under such a system the number\r\nof shade trees required is enormous, and the evils arising from the\r\nnumber of boles with their vast mass of large roots will only be the more\r\nseverely apparent as time advances. By one shade planter in Coorg I have\r\nbeen told that coffee there has already been suffering much from the\r\nquantity of boles and tree roots in the land, in consequence of the\r\ntrimming up system and the quantity of trees required in consequence. It\r\nshould also be remembered that we require our shade not only to protect\r\nour coffee from the sun's rays, but to shield it from those parching winds\r\nwhich sweep across the arid plains of the interior of India, and to\r\nprevent the drying up of the land. And is it not perfectly obvious that if\r\nwe trim up the trees so as to produce a long stem with a small crown, the\r\nparching winds will sweep unchecked over plants and soil? There is,\r\nhowever, the usual proverbial exception, and that is in the case of trees\r\ngrowing near the bottoms of ravines with steep sides to them, and where\r\nyou often want a drawn up stem and crown to cast a shadow on to a hot\r\nwestern or southern bank, and in such cases, of course, trimming up is\r\nnecessary. Having thus discussed the planting of coffee where the forest\r\nhas been cut wholly down and burnt, we will now turn to planting under the\r\nshade of the original forest trees.\r\n\r\nIn opening, then, a plantation which is to be shaded by preserving a\r\nportion of the original forest trees, the first thing to be done is to\r\nclear a wide track through the underwood from one end of the block of\r\nforest to the other, and as many tracks at right angles to the line as may\r\nfacilitate your getting about and thoroughly inspecting the land to be\r\ncleared. The next thing to be done is to cut a wide track round the entire\r\nportion to be cleared, leaving a belt of from fifteen to twenty yards as a\r\nmargin between the land to be cleared and the grassland lying outside the\r\nforest. This marginal belt will often be found useful for shelter in many\r\ncases, and it must be borne in mind, too, that the margins of jungles are\r\ngenerally composed of land into which the forest has more recently\r\nextended itself, and are therefore poorer than the interior portion of the\r\nforest, and consequently less adapted to the growth of the coffee. Another\r\nadvantage of this marginal belt is that it will prevent fires spreading\r\nfrom the grasslands, and that by planting thorny climbing plants on its\r\nouter edge a good fence may be formed. Another very great advantage I have\r\nfound from such belts is that valuable top soil may be taken from them to\r\nmanure the adjacent coffee, and especially to afford a supply of rich\r\nvirgin soil when filling up vacancies in the old coffee. This last use of\r\nthe marginal belt is particularly valuable, as it is both troublesome and\r\nexpensive to lay down either cattle manure or top soil brought from a\r\ndistance in those odd corners here and there in the plantations where\r\nvacancies are apt to occur.\r\n\r\nAfter the above suggested preliminary tracks have been opened out, the\r\nwhole underwood should be cleared and piled in heaps, and as far as\r\npossible, of course, from the trees which are most desirable for shade.\r\nThen the trees positively injurious to coffee should be cut down and their\r\nbranches lopped and piled on the stumps of the objectionable trees, and\r\nafter this a certain proportion of the less desirable kinds should be\r\nfelled. All burning should be carried on in separate piles, as a running\r\nfire through the clearing would be fatal to the standing trees, and, when\r\nfiring the piles they should be burnt off in detail at as great a distance\r\nfrom each other as possible, as the bark of many of the forest trees is\r\neasily injured by the heat arising from many blazing piles in their\r\nneighbourhood. The land having thus been thoroughly cleared, should be\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\nBut by the process I have recommended much more shade will be left than\r\nwill ultimately be required, and I have found that it is impossible to\r\nclear down at once all the trees you wish to get rid of, as, if you did,\r\nyou would be sure to require such a number of piles as would, when they\r\nwere burnt, be sure to injure the trees to be preserved. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to complete the clearing during the season following. Such\r\ntrees, then, as you may wish further to remove may be thrown down between\r\nthe rows of coffee, and others which may be likely to do much damage,\r\neither to the coffee or to the shade trees to be preserved, may be lopped\r\nand barked, and they should be barked as high up as a man can reach, as we\r\nhave found that trees barked close to the ground die slowly.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes, however, happens that the forest land is much cut up with\r\nnarrow and deep ravines, and in that case the bottoms of such ravines\r\nshould be cleared off entirely, and this can be done without injury to the\r\nstanding trees above, as, when the wood in the bottom of the ravine is\r\nbeing burnt the flames will be too distant to inflict any injury to the\r\ntrees left for shade higher up the slopes, but, as I have said, great care\r\nmust be taken to prevent any running fire through the shaded land; and I\r\ncan speak of the effect of such a fire from a melancholy experience. In\r\nthe event of bottoms of ravines being thus cleared down, it may afterwards\r\nbe found desirable to supply fresh shade on the southern and western\r\nslopes, and this can easily be done on the system recommended previously\r\nfor lands which have been entirely cleared down.\r\n\r\nIt is time now to turn our attention to the extremely complicated question\r\nof the quantity of shade required for the various aspects, gradients, and\r\nsoils we have to deal with, and let us in the first place begin with some\r\nremarks on the effects of aspect as regards heat.\r\n\r\nIn considering, then, aspect as regards sun and heat, I may observe that\r\nit is impossible to exaggerate the importance of taking into account the\r\nimmense variation in temperature on the different exposures. For the\r\neffect that the sun's rays have on certain aspects in heating the soil and\r\ndrying up the plant, are such as would be extremely difficult to believe,\r\nhad the facts not been verified by competent observers, and with the aid\r\nof the thermometer. And as regards northern and southern slopes in\r\nparticular, we shall find that the difference between one exposure and the\r\nother is just what constitutes the difference between green and dried\r\ngrass, and between leaves luxuriantly green and leaves dry and withered.\r\nAnd that the first is literally true may be seen by anyone in the months\r\nof January and February, for in these months you will see grass on\r\nnorthern aspects green, and, comparatively speaking, fresh, while, even in\r\na valley sheltered from drying winds, the grass on the southern slopes is\r\ncompletely withered. And you will see an equally striking difference in\r\nthe coffee plants--those on the northern slopes full of health and life,\r\nwhile those on the southern ones are yellow, dried up, and sickly. Even in\r\nparts of the district where coffee will not thrive without a considerable\r\namount of shade, you will always find the plants thrive well (with little\r\nor even none) on a northern bank, and look much better than on a\r\nmoderately shaded southern bank. Nor in the nursery is the effect of\r\naspect at all less striking. A nursery on a northern slope will require\r\nfar less water, and far less shade over the plants, than one with a\r\nsouthern exposure. But the late Mr. MacIvor, superintendent of the\r\nGovernment Cinchona plantations on the Nilgiri hills, has tested the value\r\nof northern and southern aspects in a way which accurately judges their\r\nrespective values. He accordingly tells us that, \"The reason why a\r\nnorthern exposure in these latitudes is beneficial is from the fact that\r\nit is much more moist during the dry season than a southern aspect,\r\nbecause the sun's declension is southerly during the dry and cloudless\r\nseason of the year, and thus, on the northern slopes, the rays of the sun\r\ndo not penetrate and parch the soil. A northern aspect has also the\r\nadvantage of preserving a much more uniform temperature than a southern\r\naspect, because the excessive radiation and evaporation in the southern\r\nslopes greatly reduces the temperature at night, while in the day they are\r\nheated to excess by the action of the sun's rays striking the surface\r\nnearly at right angles. The practical effects of aspect on the plants are\r\nso great that they cannot be overlooked with impunity, and, in order to\r\nimpress this on the minds of all those who may have the selection of\r\nlocalities for cinchona cultivation, I may mention that the difference of\r\ntemperature is almost incredible; for example, at this elevation (probably\r\nabout 7,000 feet) a thermometer laid on the surface of the southern face\r\nof a hill exposed to the sun at 3 p.m., will frequently indicate from 130°\r\nto 160° Fahr.; the same thermometer, if left in its position, and examined\r\nat 6 a.m., will generally be observed to indicate from 30° to 40°, while\r\non a similar slope, if selected with a northern aspect, the thermometer,\r\nunder the same circumstances, at 3 p.m., will generally indicate from 70°\r\nto 80°, and at 6 a.m. from 40° to 50°.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, then, about twice as much heat upon a southern as on a northern\r\naspect, and, of course, a corresponding difference as regards the effect\r\nof sun and drought on plant and soil, and it is therefore obvious that our\r\nshade policy should be governed accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs regards the comparative heat on western and eastern exposures, Mr.\r\nMacIvor does not seem to have made any experiments with the thermometer,\r\nbut where the slope is at all sharp the rays of the fierce western sun\r\nbeat strongly into the soil, while it is quite off an easterly slope, of\r\nsimilar gradient, for the whole of the afternoon, and there is an enormous\r\ndifference perceptible in the temperature. The effect, however, is in some\r\ndegree counterbalanced by the fact that the soil and the plants on the\r\neasterly slope are swept by the withering and desiccating winds which\r\nsweep over the arid plains of the interior.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, then, that the heat is very largely affected by the aspect,\r\nbut the relative amount of heat and coolness is of course controlled, to a\r\nvery considerable degree, by the gradient of the land, and just as steep\r\nnorthern slopes will be very cool, and steep eastern slopes moderately so,\r\nso will steep southerly and steep westerly gradients be extremely hot. The\r\nheat and coolness of the land, then, is constantly varying, not only with\r\nthe aspect, but with the steepness of the gradients, and both of these\r\npoints must be taken into consideration in regulating the quantity of\r\nshade required; and the reader will therefore see how impossible it is to\r\ngive more than a general guide towards the quantity of shade required, and\r\nall I can undertake to say is that about twice as much shade is required\r\non a southerly as on a northerly slope, that rather more shade is required\r\non a westerly than on an eastern aspect, and that the last named requires\r\nless than a southerly aspect.\r\n\r\nBut this question is further complicated by the varying quality of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nFor our soils vary much in the same plantation, and require a greater or\r\nless degree of shade accordingly. The lighter and drier soils, of course,\r\nrequire not only more shade, but different kinds of trees, and in the case\r\nof such soils jack and cub busree should be freely used, and especially\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nThe quantity and quality of the shade required is also complicated by\r\nconsiderations as regards wind, and, where the soil is exposed to drying\r\neast winds, more shade should be put down than would otherwise be\r\nnecessary, had we only to deal with the drying caused by the sun's heat.\r\nAnd in the case of such lands the shade should consist very largely of\r\njack and other thick foliaged trees, and these should be topped in order\r\nto keep them short and bushy, and thus the more able to shield the land\r\nfrom the effects of desiccating winds.\r\n\r\nAnd the whole subject is further complicated by questions of elevation and\r\nthe varying quantity of rainfall, as the planter is nearer to, or farther\r\nfrom the Western Ghauts, and here I can only say generally, that the\r\nnearer you go to the Ghauts the less shade you will require, and the\r\nfurther to the east the more is necessary, but the planter must be guided\r\nhere by local experience, as it is impossible to write precisely on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this branch of my subject, it may be well to show in a\r\nsingle sentence the overwhelming importance of having well regulated shade\r\nof the best kinds. If, then, the shade is excessive, the coffee will not\r\nbear well, and if it is deficient or composed of a bad class of trees, the\r\ncoffee will be certain to suffer from Borer and leaf disease.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have said in the previous sentence it is evident that the\r\nregulation of the shade is of great importance. And, as the plantation\r\nages, this thinning of the shade, lopping sometimes lower boughs, removing\r\nothers, and cutting down occasional trees, requires constant attention. As\r\na rule the whole shade should be carefully re-regulated at the end of\r\nevery second year, or at the beginning of the third, when it will\r\ngenerally be found that, in consequence of the spread of the trees, there\r\nwill be much thinning to be done. To cut down trees without injury to the\r\ncoffee is, I need hardly say, a very nice operation, though it is one that\r\nthe natives of the wooded countries, and especially the labourers from the\r\nfoot of the Ghauts, are very expert at. It should never be attempted with\r\ncoolies from the plains, who, of course, are unused to climbing trees, and\r\nhave no experience of woodland work. The branches and tops of the trees to\r\nbe felled are first removed, after a stout rope has been attached to a\r\nfork, above the point to be cut, and the end of the rope is then run round\r\nthe butt of an adjacent tree, and held by a man. A huge bough is cut and\r\nfalls with a threatening crash, but so well is the end of the rope judged\r\nthat the ends of the twigs just touch the tops of the coffee trees. Then a\r\ncoolie proceeds to lop off the smaller twigs and branches of the bough,\r\nand as he does so, it is gradually lowered till all are removed, and the\r\nbough, bereft of its clothing, is laid on the ground. Then comes the\r\ndifficult task of felling the trees between the rows of coffee, a work of\r\ngreat nicety, which is partly effected by the final stroke of the axe, and\r\npartly by hauling a rope attached to the top of the tree. When a tree\r\ncannot be felled between the rows, it may often be felled so as to fall\r\ninto the fork of an adjacent tree, and there it may be either left till it\r\ndecays or let gently down to the ground, if the stem is a thin one. Bamboo\r\nladders should be used to ascend the tree up to the first branch, as,\r\nthough coolies can readily ascend without them, their bare legs are apt to\r\nsuffer, and it is for this reason that coolies often try to shirk joining\r\nthe shade party. The branches lopped off should be cut up into short\r\nlengths, and piled between the coffee trees. Such branches and twigs, as\r\nthey decay, form good manure.\r\n\r\nI have said that the proper regulation of shade is a work of great\r\nimportance. It is also one of great difficulty, for the person who marks\r\nthe shade trees to be removed must have a thorough knowledge of the kinds\r\nmost worthy of preservation, and at the same time bear in mind the\r\naspects, the gradients, the relation of the earth to the sun during the\r\nhottest months, and the declination of the sun; and, as the planter will\r\nbe usually marking shade trees in the morning, he must keep constantly in\r\nview the points where the sun will strike in during the hot afternoon\r\nhours. Then as he looks at a shade tree that has shot up to a great\r\nheight, he must consider whether its shade is thrown on the coffee it once\r\nshaded or on to the top of an adjacent shade tree, and, as regards such a\r\ntree, he will often find that he is keeping on his land a tree that is\r\nmerely throwing a shade on to another shade tree. I was particularly\r\nstruck with this lately when looking at some howligay trees that had shot\r\nup to a great height, and which I at once ordered to be removed, as I\r\nfound that their shade was now simply thrown on to the surrounding shade\r\ntrees. In short, the trees were now doing no good, and were therefore\r\nmerely doing harm by occupying the land and robbing it of food. I have\r\nsaid that when marking shade the planters must bear in mind the relation\r\nof the earth to the sun during the hottest months, and this caution is\r\nvery necessary, because if he should happen to be marking trees in January\r\nfor removal after the crop season is over, and does not remember that the\r\nearth is daily shifting its position, he will find that he will have made\r\nmany mistakes as to the trees which should be preserved, and that a tree\r\nthat is very well placed for blocking out the hot afternoon sun in\r\nJanuary, may be of very little use in March and April.\r\n\r\nAfter a shade tree has been cut down it is necessary, in order to prevent\r\nthe stump throwing up suckers, to remove the bark thoroughly from the\r\nstump, and also from any roots that project from the surface of the\r\nground. If this is not done the stump and its roots will live on and take\r\nup manure intended for the coffee.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that, in many parts of an estate, as the shade\r\ntrees become lofty the sun will come in, just as it would on a man's head\r\nif he carried his umbrella erect, and at the end of a long pole, and I\r\nhave seen coffee trees so much exposed to the sun as to require fresh\r\nshade to be planted near them, not withstanding that some of the coffee\r\ntrees in question were almost touching the stem of a very tall shade tree.\r\nWhen the planter observes that the sun is thus likely to come in from the\r\nshooting up of the shade trees, he should plant fresh shade. Nor need he\r\nbe afraid of putting down too much, for it is easily removed if this is\r\ndone when the trees are small, and then it must also be remembered that,\r\nas the plantation ages, both coffee and soil call for more shade, as the\r\ngrowing power of the land, and its ability to keep the trees fresh and\r\ngreen, naturally diminishes with the advance of time. Whenever, then, the\r\nappearance of the coffee shows that it is needed, fresh shade should be at\r\nonce supplied, for every yellow leaved patch of coffee in a plantation is\r\na breeding ground for the Borer insects, which will gradually spread into\r\nthe adjacent coffee, where their presence will never be detected till hot,\r\ndry seasons occur, which they are sure to do sooner or later. When\r\nspreading from such yellow patches the Borer insect may not attack strong\r\ntrees. On the contrary, it will generally attack those which are in a\r\ndried up condition either from weakness of constitution or because they\r\nare suffering from the effects of an over heavy crop, but in such trees it\r\nwill surely obtain a footing, and so be ready to spread further when hot,\r\ndry seasons arrive. When, then, the appearance of the coffee shows that\r\nmore shade is required, charcoal trees should be planted, and on the\r\nnorthern side of them cuttings of the good caste shade trees should be put\r\ndown; and I particularly emphasize the side for the nurse because it is\r\nthus interposed between the sun and the permanent shade trees to be\r\nsheltered.\r\n\r\nWhen the permanent shade trees have grown to the required size, the\r\ncharcoal trees should be removed. It must be remembered that the permanent\r\nshade trees will grow very slowly unless sheltered by such nurses from the\r\nsun, and further, that the older the land the slower is the growth of all\r\ntrees. It is most necessary, then, in all old land to dig holes at least\r\nfour feet deep, and fill them with some good top soil from the forest, or\r\nwith ordinary soil and cattle manure and bones. In order fully to protect\r\nthe young shade trees from cattle and the sun, I now erect a square of\r\nfencing composed of palm tree slabs, and so high that cattle cannot reach\r\nover it, and, in the dry season, place some toddy tree branches across the\r\nsquare so as to shade the plants put down. In each square I plant a cub\r\nbusree cutting, or one of the five kinds of trees recommended; sow several\r\njack seeds, and a charcoal tree as nurse. In the case of the tree cutting\r\nfailing to thrive, the planter will then always have a jack tree to fall\r\nback on. Should the cutting succeed the jack plant may be removed. I may\r\nhere add that the parts requiring more shade are naturally more apparent\r\nin the hot season, and the planter should then put down a short pole with\r\na flag at the end of it, whenever more shade is required. This will\r\ngreatly facilitate the work of shade planting in the monsoon, as at that\r\ntime the places where more shade is required are not very readily\r\napparent, as all the coffee then becomes more or less green.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the fact that parasites (Kanarese--_Bundlikay_) attack\r\nthe shade trees, and especially the nogurigay and jack trees. They should,\r\nof course, be cut off along with the bough on which they may happen to be\r\ngrowing; and it is important to remember that this should be done before\r\nthe seed ripens, which is usually at the beginning of the monsoon. The\r\nlatter end of April is the best time to carry out this work, as, if\r\ndeferred till rain begins, the trees become slippery, and so dangerous for\r\nthe climbers.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out that the five trees I have recommended as being the\r\nbest for shade can all be grown from cuttings, and it is important to\r\npoint out that these should be taken from young and vigorous trees, and\r\nnot, as is often done, from trees which are declining from age. There are\r\nsome useful remarks at pages 88 and 89 of Mr. Graham Anderson's \"Jottings\r\non Coffee,\" on the preparation and planting of cuttings. The holes should\r\nbe two feet deep, and filled up to three-quarters of the depth with soil.\r\nThe cuttings should be six feet long with a fork at the top. They should\r\nbe made at the beginning of the monsoon, and left in a cool and shady\r\nplace in order to thicken the sap, the lower extremity of the cutting\r\nshould be cut off with a curved slope, like the mouth-piece of a\r\nflageolet. Put the cutting gently into the hole, so as not to fray the\r\nbark, and tread down firmly. Wounds should be smeared with a mixture of\r\ncowdung and mud. The attí (_Ficus glomerata_) may also be grown from\r\ncuttings, but these should be rather thinner than those taken from the\r\nfive trees first mentioned as being the best to plant for shade.\r\n\r\nIt has been previously pointed out that charcoal trees are valuable as\r\nnurses. They may be raised by clearing and burning a small piece of\r\njungle, or by putting some virgin jungle soil in a bed and watering it,\r\nwhen charcoal plants will spring up. When a few inches high, take the\r\nplants up carefully with a ball of earth and transplant into baskets\r\nfilled with jungle top soil. Put out the plants with their baskets in\r\nholes about the size of those usually made for coffee plants, and early in\r\nthe monsoon, and see that they are well protected from cattle.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think it well to mention that we have on my property, so\r\nfar as I am aware, by far the oldest artificial shading of coffee in\r\nIndia. For many years all the estates in Mysore relied on the original\r\nforest shade, but mine was partly destroyed by a running fire when the\r\nclearings were first made, and some of the land was cleared wholly down,\r\nburned off, and planted with the most desirable kinds of shade trees. Our\r\nexperience on this property dates back to the year 1857, and is therefore\r\nparticularly valuable, for the defects connected with some trees were not\r\napparent for as much, in one important case, as thirty years.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[52] I regret that I am unable to give the botanical name of this tree,\r\nand of some others subsequently mentioned. I have drawn up a list of\r\ntrees, some of which may be retained till better trees can be grown to\r\nsupply their places, and also of other trees which are positively\r\ninjurious to coffee, but do not publish them, partly in order to save\r\nspace, and partly because I have not been able to ascertain the botanical\r\nnames of all the trees in question.\r\n\r\n[53] My manager last year weighed and counted the Jack fruits from a\r\nsingle tree. There were forty fruits which weighed 572 lbs.

And it is very important to call attention to this point, because\r\nhitherto planters have not in any way allowed shade to disturb their\r\nmanurial practices, but have applied their manures equally to land under\r\nthe direct shade of the trees, and to the open spaces between them, which\r\nare only under the influence of lateral shade, or, in other words, have\r\nmanured their land as if there were no shade trees on it whatever. A\r\nlittle consideration, however, will show that the kinds and qualities of\r\nthe manures applied should be quite different under the shade of trees,\r\nfrom what they ought to be in the open spaces between them. For, close\r\naround the stems of the shade trees we have a large leaf deposit, which\r\nmanures the soil and maintains its physical condition, and, at the same\r\ntime, comparatively speaking, small crops of coffee, while in the open\r\nspaces between the shade trees we have a small amount of leaf deposit, and\r\nmuch heavier crops of coffee. If, then, we further take into consideration\r\nthe fact that the soil between the shade trees is liable to be\r\ndeteriorated by a greater exposure to wash and to baking from the sun\r\nafter the soil has been thoroughly soaked, it is evident that manuring\r\nshould be largely varied both in quality and quantity, if we are at once\r\nto manure efficiently and economically. And I desire the more particularly\r\nto call attention to this matter, because no planter, as far as I am\r\naware, has at all studied the subject. And it is principally of very great\r\nimportance because what we call bulk manures, i.e., farmyard manures,\r\npulp, composts, and top soil, are difficult to procure in large\r\nquantities, and cost much to apply, as they have to be carried on coolies'\r\nheads, and often for considerable distances, down the rows of coffee\r\ntrees. The more, then, we can limit our applications of bulk manure to\r\nsuch lands as urgently require them, the better shall we be able to devote\r\na full supply to the soil which most requires such manures. Now if we\r\napply our bulk manures to the land directly under the shade trees, we\r\nshall certainly be injudiciously using our mammal resources, because the\r\nleaf deposit under the shade trees supplies exactly that kind of padding\r\nwhich gives its chief value to bulk manures, and, if these opinions are\r\nsound, it therefore follows that we should, as a rule, apply all our bulk\r\nmanures to the spaces between the shade trees, and only apply them to the\r\nland under the shade trees, when, from the soil being of a clayey\r\ncharacter, an occasional application of bulk manure may be required to\r\nimprove the texture of the soil, or, in other words, make it more easily\r\nworkable. And it also follows that we should only apply bones, lime, and\r\nashes, fish and oil-cake to the coffee under the direct influence of the\r\nshade trees.\r\n\r\nBut there is another question as regards manuring under the shade trees\r\nthat requires careful consideration, and that is, whether we can, by heavy\r\nmanuring, produce in such situations a larger crop than we could by a\r\nsmall application of manure, and from an experiment made by the late Mr.\r\nPringle, formerly chemist on Messrs. Matheson and Co.'s estates in Coorg,\r\nit would seem to be a waste of money to supply more than a very moderate\r\namount to the coffee directly under the shade trees, for he found that a\r\nconsiderable increase in the quantity of manure gave no increase in the\r\ncrop. But I do not, of course, accept this experiment as conclusive, as it\r\nwas made with bones alone, and it is possible that a more favourable\r\nresult might have been obtained had an application of foliage stimulating\r\nmanure been used as well, for the growth of new wood under shade is\r\nextremely slow, and it is probable that this slow growth, by giving an\r\ninsufficient supply of young wood, is really the main cause of the yield\r\nunder the shade trees being so much less than that from the coffee in the\r\nspaces between them. But the whole of this branch of my subject requires\r\nfurther careful experiment and observation before we can arrive at any\r\ndefinite conclusion. In the meanwhile, and till it can be shown that, with\r\nthe aid of foliage stimulating manures, we can increase the yield under\r\nthe direct shade of the trees, it is evident that as coffee under direct\r\nshade produces less than coffee in the spaces between the shade trees, the\r\ncoffee that produces more should have a larger supply of manure.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add here that, in order to prevent confusion,\r\nthe whole field of coffee to be operated on should first of all be manured\r\nevenly all over with the quantity and quality of manure which it is\r\nadvisable to use under the shade trees. After that, additional manure\r\nshould be applied to the spaces between the shade trees. It is quite clear\r\nto me that a great economy of manure would be effected by this practice,\r\nand that from not applying bulk manures to the coffee under the shade\r\ntrees, the physical condition of the land in the spaces between them\r\ncould be maintained in a much more satisfactory degree than it is at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThen there is another question which, I believe, has hitherto escaped\r\nnotice, and that is, as to whether we should not make some alteration in\r\nthe kinds of manure so as to suit them better to the various aspects we\r\nhave to deal with, for even in land of the same quality, and treated in\r\nprecisely the same way, there is a considerable difference in the\r\nappearance of the coffee when we pass from an eastern or southern aspect\r\nto a western one, and a very great and marked difference is at once\r\nperceptible when you enter the coffee on a northern aspect. In the\r\nlast-named case the coffee is nearly always green, and steadily but slowly\r\ngrowing, while on the southern and eastern aspects the coffee in the hot\r\nweather is apt to present a dried-up and sickly appearance. Then on these\r\ntwo last-named aspects there is commonly an over supply of suddenly grown\r\nwood. We should therefore, I think, increase foliage-stimulating manures\r\non northern aspects, and diminish them on the southern and eastern, while\r\nwe should have a medium degree of such manure in the case of western\r\naspects. It seems to me that the reasoning in favour of\r\nfoliage-stimulating manures on northern aspects is the same as in the case\r\nof coffee trees under direct tree shade, which always prevents the rapid\r\ngrowth of new wood. But on this point, as well as on that in the previous\r\nsection, experiments must be made before any definite conclusion can be\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of manure that should be annually supplied is evidently a\r\nmatter of the greatest importance, and here the first thing to be borne in\r\nmind is that of the four manures we require, namely, lime, nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, and potash, the first two are somewhat easily removed\r\nfrom the soil, while the last two are firmly retained by it. It is\r\nevident, then, that lime and nitrogen should be applied little and often,\r\nwhile phosphoric acid and potash may be applied either little and often,\r\nor in large quantities at longer intervals, whichever may be found most\r\nconvenient. But in the opinion of an eminent agricultural chemist whom I\r\nhave specially consulted on the subject, nitrogen, if applied in slowly\r\ndecomposing form, as for instance, in the shape of oil-cake, would only be\r\nlost in an infinitesimal degree, but still he admits that there would be a\r\nloss, and as we cannot tell what that loss may amount to under the\r\ninfluence of our tropical climate and deluges of rain, it would be safe to\r\nassume that nitrogen, as well as lime, should be put down at short\r\nintervals and, in order to make up for the escape of these manures from\r\nthe soil, in larger proportions than either phosphoric acid or potash.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out that phosphoric acid is retained by the soil, and it is\r\nimportant to remember that it is only removed by the crops of coffee to\r\nthe extent of from one-and-a-half to two pounds per acre per annum, and\r\nthese are two facts that every planter should bear in mind when he\r\ncontemplates following the common custom of manuring with bones. For if he\r\nremembers that about one-half of the bones consists of phosphate of lime,\r\nand that about one-half of the latter consists of phosphoric acid, he will\r\nat a glance see, when he estimates the amount of phosphoric acid removed\r\nby the crops, that if he puts down even 100 lbs. of bones per acre he will\r\nhave put down enough phosphoric acid for about twelve crops of coffee. And\r\nyet for a planter to put down 3 cwt. of bones per annum regularly is quite\r\na common thing, and a friend of mine, after having manured his land one\r\nyear with bones to a moderate amount, put down each year, for the two\r\nfollowing years, no less than three-quarters of a ton of bone-meal per\r\nacre. So that, making a large allowance for the phosphoric acid taken up\r\nby the shade trees, he had put down, in these last two years, enough\r\nphosphoric acid to last for the crops of 300 years. From the application\r\nof bones he had undoubtedly obtained a great benefit, but I feel sure that\r\nit was from the lime and the nitrogen of the bones, for the application of\r\nbones that preceded the two applications of three-quarters of a ton per\r\nannum must have left the soil amply supplied with phosphoric acid. Now\r\nassuming that the soil required lime, and a moderate degree of nitrogen,\r\nthese could have been supplied far more cheaply, and just as efficiently\r\nhad my friend applied a small dressing of ordinary lime, and some\r\noil-cake, and I am the more convinced of the accuracy of this view after\r\nvisiting Mr. Reilly's Hillgrove estate near Coonoor on the slopes of the\r\nNilgiri hills, and hearing the result of his very long experience. Bones\r\nhe had never used but once, and that on a small portion of the estate, but\r\nhe had always applied lime once every three years at the rate of about 4\r\nor 5 cwt. per acre; the other manures he had used were cattle manure, and\r\ntown manure from Coonoor, and these added to the small quantity originally\r\nin the soil, had supplied his coffee amply with the 2 lbs. of phosphoric\r\nacid annually removed by the crops. After much consideration, and hearing\r\nMr. Reilly's views, it seems quite clear to me that as but a small\r\nquantity of phosphoric acid is removed by the crops, and as that manure is\r\nfirmly retained by the soil, bones need only be used at long intervals\r\nprovided lime is regularly applied in small quantities.\r\n\r\nAnd next, before we can approach, or attempt to determine, the quantity of\r\nmanure required, we have to take into account the loss by wash, either\r\nfrom the surface or by downward percolation, and the absorption of manure\r\nby the roots of the shade trees. We have also to take into consideration\r\nthe manure returned by the shade trees in the shape of fallen leaves, and\r\nthe ammonia derived from the rainfall, so that it is impossible to state\r\nwith any approach to accuracy the amount of manure that should be\r\napplied. We can only say then that, whatever the required amount may be it\r\nmust be very considerable, for in addition to the above-mentioned losses\r\nof manure, we require a considerable amount for the demands of the coffee\r\ntrees, and that, further, it must vary with the amount of the rainfall,\r\nand the retentive or non-retentive character of the soil. The crop, it is\r\ntrue, takes comparatively little from the soil, and Mr. John Hughes,\r\nAgricultural Chemist, 79, Mark Lane,--points out in his \"Reports on Ceylon\r\nSoils and Coffee Manures,\" that 5 cwt. of parchment coffee an acre, which\r\nis an average crop over a long series of years, only removes from the\r\nsoil--\r\n\r\n                   lbs.\r\nNitrogen           8-1/4\r\nPotash             7-1/2\r\nPhosphoric acid    1-1/2\r\nLime               1\r\n                  ------\r\nTotal             18-1/4\r\n\r\nAssuming then, he tells us, that the small quantity of potash required\r\ncould be supplied by the soil, and that the pulp is returned to it, the\r\nloss by the crops could be fully supplied by 100 lbs. of castor cake and\r\n10 lbs. of bones per acre. Then if we require much more from the plant\r\nthan the production of crop (for we expect it, in addition, to grow wood\r\nfor the succeeding crop, and during this process the plant grows much\r\nsuperfluous wood, besides suckers, which have to be removed), it must be\r\nremembered that all primings and superfluous wood are left on the land.\r\nWhat there is actually carried off it is really very small in quantity.\r\nWhy, then, it will naturally be asked, is it necessary that so much manure\r\nshould be present in the soil if we wish to grow good coffee and have\r\ncontinuously good crops, and why is it that if manuring is neglected you\r\nwill soon find that it is only the rich hollows that are able to maintain\r\nthe coffee in good condition and produce good crops continuously? To such\r\nquestions no distinct answer can be given, and we can only conjecture that\r\ncoffee, when it wants its food, must, for some unknown reason, have a\r\nconsiderable supply at hand. There is, however, one test which, I think,\r\nalways shows conclusively whether this food is present in the quantity\r\nrequired to supply the needs of the plant. Just before the hot weather the\r\ncoffee trees throw out a small flush of young wood. Now if the trees have\r\ngiven a fair average crop, and at the same time have a good show of\r\nbearing wood for the next season's crop, and are also throwing out a good\r\nsupply of vigorous young shoots, then you may be sure that your land is\r\nwell fed. But if the trees throw out no young shoots at that time, or very\r\nfew, then you will know that your land is not as well fed as it ought to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nIt might naturally be supposed that I could furnish some guide to the\r\nplanter, from our experience in Mysore, as to the quantity of manure that\r\nshould be put down, but I regret to say that I am unable to do so, as I\r\nknow of no estate where a regular and continuous system of manuring has\r\nbeen carried out. But in North Coorg, and very close to the Mysore Border,\r\nthe continuous practice on Mr. Mangles's Coovercolley Estate of 500 acres\r\ngives a fairly approximate idea of what can keep an estate in a well-fed\r\ncondition. There the practice has been to put down every third year from 7\r\nto 10 cwt. of bone-meal an acre, and one-third of a bushel of cattle\r\nmanure, and, besides this, composts of pulp, mixed with top soil and lime.\r\nNow this is the finest estate I ever saw. The coffee was even and of a\r\nbeautiful colour, and when I saw it towards the end of 1891 there was a\r\nfair crop of coffee on the trees, and an ample supply of young wood for\r\nthe following crop, and the land was so well fed with nitrogen that an\r\nexperimental application of nitrate of soda to a part of the land had\r\nproduced no perceptible effect on the trees. From what I have previously\r\nsaid as to the application of bone-meal being overdone, I think it\r\nprobable that the estate would have presented as good an appearance had\r\nthe land, after once being well stored with phosphoric acid, been treated\r\nwith small applications of lime instead of bones. Then another estate I\r\nsaw in 1891 in Coorg, in the Bamboo district, furnished some guide as to\r\nthe amount of manure required where cattle manure was not available, and\r\non the estate in question, which had both a good crop on the trees and\r\nample wood for the future, I was informed that, in the year previous, 6\r\ncwt. of castor cake and 3 cwt. of bones had been applied per acre, and\r\nthat for the four preceding years 4-1/3 cwt. of manure, containing 2 parts\r\nof castor to I of bones, had been applied, but that the last-named amount\r\nhad been found to be too small. The reader will find in the chapter on\r\nCoorg some further information, which has since been supplied to me by Mr.\r\nMeynell, on this point.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of manure that should be put down at a time is evidently a\r\nmatter of great importance, as if you begin by putting down a large\r\napplication you are certain to have an over-heavy crop, followed by\r\nexhaustion, and a very poor crop the following year, while the object of\r\nall intelligent fruit cultivators is to work for moderate even crops. It\r\nseems quite clear, then, that we should manure little and often, as you\r\nthereby not only avoid the risk of over-heavy crops, but economize your\r\nmanure. For is it not obvious that if you put down at once a supply of\r\nnitrogen and lime to last for three years, you increase the risk of loss\r\nfrom wash and downward percolation? And it must also be considered that an\r\nover-heavy crop leaves the trees in an exhausted and dried-up state to go\r\nthrough the hot weather, when they will be liable to be attacked by the\r\nBorer insect, which, as we shall afterwards more particularly see,\r\ndelights in dry wood. So that when we further take into consideration the\r\ninjury to the constitution of the trees which is caused by over-heavy\r\ncrops, we need have no doubt that there is much reason to dread them. I\r\nwould therefore strongly deprecate, for the preceding reasons, heavy\r\nmanuring (even the mind may be over-manured in the eager desire to arrive\r\nat a cultured intellect), and would advise that a beginning be made with a\r\nmoderate application, and, if this is found to be insufficient, that the\r\namount be gradually increased till the trees show that they can with case\r\ngive regular average crops. If cattle manure or jungle top soil is\r\navailable, a quarter of a bushel a tree may be annually applied of either,\r\naccompanied by 3 cwt. of bone-meal. And, if neither of the two former\r\nsources are available, then 3 cwt. of bone-meal and 2 cwt. of white castor\r\ncakes would be a reasonable application. After applying 3 cwt. of\r\nbone-meal per acre for three consecutive years the land ought to be amply\r\nstocked with phosphoric acid, and the bone-meal should be discontinued,\r\nand its place supplied with small applications of lime, either annually or\r\nat intervals of two or three years, should the latter course be more\r\nconvenient. And subsequently, when there is reason to suppose that the\r\nland requires a fresh supply of phosphoric acid, an application of\r\nbone-meal may again be used. I would particularly warn the planter against\r\nover-manuring light dry soil, or south and south-western aspects, or the\r\nupper and drier portions of eastern aspects, as an over-heavy crop on\r\nthese aspects is very perilous even with good shade, for we may not have a\r\ndrop of rain from November till April, and should such a drought occur,\r\nand be preceded by a dry season (and such seasons occurred in 1865 and\r\n1866, and caused the great attack of the Borer insect, which was so fatal\r\nto all insufficiently-shaded coffee, and from which even well-shaded\r\ncoffee suffered to some extent), or should even a single dry, hot season\r\nfollow immediately after the crop is picked, there would be sure to be a\r\nserious drying up of the plant, with but small chance of its bearing\r\nanything worth having the season following, and very great risk of a\r\nsevere attack of Borer. But on northern and north-western aspects the land\r\nis not exposed to parching east winds, and, as we have seen, has a\r\ntemperature about one-half cooler than that on a southern aspect, and the\r\nplanter may therefore on such aspects manure with greater freedom. But\r\neven in these aspects I am sure that over-heavy manuring will lead\r\nultimately to injury to the trees, and, in a series of years, to the\r\nproduction of a smaller amount of coffee.\r\n\r\nI have indicated the amount of manure which in my opinion ought to be put\r\ndown when manure is applied for the first time on a plantation, and if the\r\nplantation is of a flat character, or only on very moderate slopes, the\r\nmanure should be evenly applied all over it. But if, as often happens,\r\nthere are hollows and ridges on the land, then the ridges should be, as a\r\nrule, much more heavily manured than the hollows, for which a very little\r\nmanure will suffice, as so much is washed into them, and they are,\r\nbesides, much richer to start with. It is very important to note at the\r\noutset all those spots which, in the original forest, are very rich, so\r\nthat the manure may be applied accordingly, and though, as I have said,\r\nthe ridges as a rule are poor, there are many instances where the top of a\r\nridge, from being pretty wide, is rich, though the sides of it for a\r\nlittle way down are nearly always poor. I have lately been minutely\r\nexamining old forest land, with the view of removing top soil from it, and\r\nhave been much struck with the variation in the depth of the rich surface\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nWe have next to consider the time of year at which manure should be\r\napplied to the land, and here we shall find that the planter, like the\r\nfarmer, often has to do things when he can, and not when he should, and\r\nthough, from the risk of loss by wash alone, there can be no doubt that\r\nall manures should be put down after the heavy rains of the monsoon are\r\nover, it is difficult to see how this can be carried out in the case of\r\nbulk manures, on account of the difficulty of getting enough labour to at\r\nonce cope with the ordinary estate work, and apply a class of manure which\r\nabsorbs so much hand labour. Then there is the difficulty of carting\r\nmanure at that season when the roads, which are not macadamized, would be\r\ncut to pieces. But this difficulty could be overcome were a sufficient\r\nnumber of storage sheds provided to which the manure might be carted\r\nduring the dry season. But the sheds would cost a good deal of money, and\r\nthe cost of the manure would be increased by the cost of extra handling,\r\nor in other words putting the manure in the sheds and taking it out again.\r\nSo that I am inclined to think that it would be better to apply, by direct\r\ncartage from the cattle sheds, as much bulk manure as can be applied in\r\nthe month of September, and the remainder at any convenient time after\r\ncrop. Another great objection to applying manure after crop, and before\r\nthe monsoon, is, that you stimulate the growth of the weeds which spring\r\nup with the early rains, and also much growth of suckers, and superfluous\r\nwood in the coffee, all of which have to be handled off at considerable\r\nexpense, whereas, it is hardly necessary to say, that the weed growth is\r\nsmaller at the end of the monsoon, and the force of the plant directed\r\nrather to the maturing of the berry than the growth of surplus wood. But\r\nin the case of light manures such as bones and castor cake, there is no\r\ndifficulty in applying them in September, and an effort should certainly\r\nbe made to put them down then. Another advantage of manuring at the end of\r\nthe monsoon would be that the planter could then clearly perceive what\r\ntrees would be certain to give a good crop, and give them an extra\r\nquantity of manure, and also diminish his application of manure in the\r\ncase of such parts of the plantation as might be yielding a small crop. I\r\nmay here mention that, from reliable information received from Coorg,\r\nresults there have shown that it is best to apply a portion of the manure\r\nafter crop to strengthen the blossom, and a portion after the heavy\r\nmonsoon rains are over to strengthen the trees and assist in maturing the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nBut the most important point, perhaps, as regards the best time for\r\nmanuring is the bearing that the time of manurial application has on leaf\r\ndisease, and Mr. Marshall Ward in his third report on leaf disease (p. 15)\r\nhas some most valuable remarks on this question. \"The object of the\r\nplanter should be,\" he says \"to produce mature leaves as soon as possible\r\nand keep them on the branches as long as possible.\" Now if leaves are\r\nproduced in April and May they become attacked by the fungus while still\r\nyoung, and in August and September the ripening crop is left bare on the\r\nbranches. But the leaves which were in bud in December are matured and\r\nwell hardened, and have already, by living longer, done much service to\r\nthe tree. He then points out that when certain districts in Ceylon\r\nsuffered from a bad attack of leaf disease in July, \"a large surface of\r\nyoung and succulent leaves were ready to receive the spores of the\r\nHemeleïa.\" The germination of the spores was rapid, and the young leaves\r\nwere soon destroyed. The planter then, he says, should manure and prune so\r\nas to grow matured leaves during those months when the least damp and wind\r\nmay be expected. And the same remarks are evidently equally valuable as\r\nregards rot, and show us the necessity of modifying our manurial and\r\npruning practices so as to enable the tree the better to contend against\r\nit as well as leaf disease. All manuring, then, which leads to the\r\nproduction of young succulent foliage just at the beginning of the rains\r\nshould be avoided, and the same remark applies equally to pruning. But I\r\nshall again return to the subject when writing on pruning.\r\n\r\nAs to the best method of applying the manure, great differences of opinion\r\nand practice exist. At one time in Mysore it was customary to cut a\r\nshallow trench in the shape of a half moon around the upper sides of the\r\ntrees about two feet from the stem, and deep enough to contain the manure,\r\nwhich was then covered in with the soil taken out. But this process was\r\nfound to be expensive, and of course took much labour, which is sometimes\r\nextremely scarce, and on my property we have for some years\r\npast--excepting in the case of manuring with fish, which is liable to be\r\ncarried off by birds, dogs, jackals, and village pigs--scattered all the\r\nmanure on the surface, and close around the stem of the tree, with the\r\nidea that the manure would be less likely to be taken up by weeds, and by\r\nthe roots of the shade trees. But in connection with this system there is\r\na fact which I did not take into account, but which is well worthy of\r\ncareful consideration, and that is, that the tendency of such a system of\r\nmanuring is to keep the coffee roots close to the surface. Now it has been\r\nsuggested by the late Mr. Pringle, whose opinion on another matter I have\r\npreviously given, that this would have an unfavourable effect, if we had,\r\nas sometimes happens, deficient blossom showers; as in that case, and with\r\nmany rootlets near the surface, a stimulus would be given to the plant\r\nwhich would induce it to throw out the blossom when there was not enough\r\nrain to bring it to perfection; whereas, if, by putting down the manure\r\nmore deeply we attracted the roots downwards, the blossom buds could only\r\nbe started after such an amount of rain as would give the soil such a\r\nsoaking that a successful blossom would be insured. There certainly seems\r\nto me to be a great deal in this idea, but I am not aware that we have had\r\nany experiments made side by side as regards surface manuring, and\r\nmanuring in pits, and therefore am not in a position to express a decided\r\nopinion on the subject, but theoretically there would seem to be much in\r\nfavour of burying manure in pits, and it seems certain that the manure\r\nwould be less likely to be taken up by weeds than in the case of surface\r\nmanuring.\r\n\r\nI need hardly add that in the case of all steep parts of a plantation all\r\nmanure should be, if not buried deeply, at least covered with soil after\r\nthe digging of a trench large enough to contain the manure. On the\r\nplantations on the Nilgiri Hills the manure is put into pits 2-1/2 feet\r\nlong, 1 foot 6 inches wide, and 1 foot deep on the lower side of the pit,\r\nwhich of course would make the side of the pit on the upper side of them\r\nmuch more than one foot in depth. The trenches or pits are dug across the\r\nslope and in front of each coffee tree, and in the line (i.e., not in the\r\ncentre of each set of four plants). These pits are not filled up to the\r\nbrim, but the manure is placed in the bottom of them, and is then covered\r\nwith soil, so that the pit is about one-half filled up. The soil taken out\r\nis heaped in a curve above the pit so as to prevent heavy rain washing\r\ndown into the pit. When more manure is required to be added--say\r\nbone-meal--it is scattered on the soil in the pit, or the top soil in it\r\nis scraped off and the manure scattered and then covered up.\r\n\r\nI now propose to consider our manurial resources in detail, and shall\r\nbegin with the first stay of all agriculture, farmyard manure, as to the\r\nvalue of which for coffee I have never met with any difference of opinion.\r\nBut there are many objections to relying on farmyard manure, or, at least,\r\nto applying it on a large scale, as, if the planter keeps many cattle of\r\nhis own, he runs great risk of his herd being invaded by disease, and the\r\ndifficulty and expense of feeding a large number of cattle is very\r\nconsiderable. In some cases it is possible to hire cattle from the\r\nnatives, and this is done occasionally, and at the rate of 15 rupees a\r\nmonth for 100 head, but here again risk from disease is often incurred,\r\nand if it broke out, the natives would withdraw their cattle. The question\r\nthen naturally arises whether, considering the great cost and trouble\r\nattendant on manufacturing cattle manure on a large scale, we cannot find\r\nsome substitute that would diminish the quantity now required. And here it\r\nis important to ask what farmyard manure consists of. It consists, then,\r\nof the excreta of animals, and the vegetable matter used as litter. From a\r\nchemical point of view it mainly provides, in addition to the organic\r\nmatter, in a slowly-acting form, lime, nitrogen, potash, and phosphoric\r\nacid, and from a physical point of view it furnishes a padding to maintain\r\nthe texture of the soil, or, in other words, to keep it in a loose and\r\nfriable condition. And with reference to this last very important point, I\r\nmay remind the reader that Sir John Lawes has well pointed out that \"All\r\nour experiments tend to show that it is the physical condition of the\r\nsoil, its capacity for absorbing and retaining moisture, its permeability\r\nto roots, and its capacity for absorbing and radiating heat, that is of\r\nmore importance than its strictly-speaking chemical composition.\" Now as\r\nregards the chemical aspect of the manurial question, if we assume, as we\r\nhave every reason to do from the small quantity of potash required, and\r\nits supply from decomposing stones in the land, that the potash does not\r\nrequire to be taken into account, we shall find that our nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid can be far more cheaply supplied by fish, or by a mixture\r\nof bone-meal and oil-cake than by farmyard manure, and should it be found\r\nthat potash does require to be added, we could obtain it more cheaply from\r\nashes or kainit. Then in order to provide the padding that farmyard manure\r\nsupplies, and to furnish nitrogen in a slowly-acting form, we could\r\ncollect dry leaves, twigs from jungle trees, ferns, and any other\r\navailable vegetable matter, form them into a compost with some earth, or\r\njungle top soil, and apply the mixture to the land. With such a compost as\r\nI have suggested, bone-meal or fish-manure in small quantity might be\r\nmixed, and we should then have a very good substitute for all the chemical\r\nand physical advantages to be derived from the very best kind of farmyard\r\nmanure. But there is another way of arriving at the same end, which is\r\nopen to many planters, and that is by collecting top soil from the fringe\r\nof jungle commonly left round the plantation, or from the uncultivated\r\njungle of the estate, or from adjacent pieces of jungle land. And such\r\npieces of land varying from ten to twenty acres can commonly be purchased,\r\nand can be used to supply top soil. This, of course, has in it much\r\nvegetable matter in various stages of decay, and a mixture of it with a\r\nsmall quantity of bone-meal would form a manure superior, as I shall\r\nafterwards show when I come to treat of top soil, to farmyard manure\r\nchemically, and superior to it from a physical point of view. To such\r\nlocal manurial resources I would call particular attention, as planters\r\nhave hitherto relied far too exclusively on cattle manure, and imported\r\nmanures, such as bones, fish, and oil-cake, and it is evident that we\r\ncould dispense with much of all these manures if we made a full use of the\r\nresources I have recommended. In concluding my remarks on cattle manure I\r\nmay observe that it is both costly to supply and to apply to the land. It\r\nis difficult, of course, to make exact calculations on the subject, as the\r\nfacilities for supplying litter vary so much, but generally speaking it\r\ncosts from 70 to 80 rupees an acre if we manure at about the rate of a\r\nthird of a bushel per tree.\r\n\r\nI now turn to a consideration of the value of jungle top soil, a manure to\r\nwhich I have only lately given particular attention, though I was, of\r\ncourse, well aware of its value in a general way, and may begin by\r\nstating that two samples of what we were using on my estates have been\r\nanalyzed by Dr. Voelcker, the object being partly to ascertain the value\r\nof the soil and partly to compare its cost with the cost of cattle manure.\r\nAfter estimating the cost of making cattle manure, and calculating as\r\nclosely as possible the cost of obtaining and applying jungle top soil\r\nfrom land adjacent to the plantation, it was found that in the case of the\r\nbest sample of top soil, obtained by removing only four or five inches of\r\nthe soil, it paid nearly twice as well to use it as a manurial agent as it\r\nwould to use cattle manure, and I may add that three tons of the soil\r\ncontain the same manurial matter as two tons of ordinary well-made English\r\nfarmyard manure. In the case of the second sample analyzed, and which I\r\nwas sure from the character of the land must be of inferior quality, it\r\nwas found that 2-1/4 tons of the soil would contain as much manurial value\r\nas one ton of farmyard manure, and that the cost of using the two\r\nmaterials would be about the same.\r\n\r\nI had also analyzed at the same time a sample of a kind of decayed\r\npink-coloured rock, as I had found that coffee had thriven well in the\r\npink soil which had evidently been formed from the rock in question, but\r\nthe manurial value was so small that Dr. Voelcker thought that it might\r\nmerely be of use in improving the physical condition of the soil. I\r\nhowever applied it to some backward coffee, and also applied some of the\r\nbest top soil to a contiguous piece of backward coffee, and was much\r\nsurprised to find that the pink soil, to which little direct manurial\r\nvalue was attached by Dr. Voelcker, showed results superior to the best\r\ntop soil applied alongside of it, and I am now applying it on a large\r\nscale. This soil, I may mention, is applied by the natives to the surface\r\nof their vegetable beds. They do not attach any manurial value to it, but\r\napply it to keep the vegetables cool, as the soil has quite a remarkable\r\neffect in keeping itself cool while the adjacent soil is quite hot, and I\r\nhave now applied it to the flower beds near my house, and also to the\r\nwalks around the bungalow. This pink decayed rock is sometimes streaked\r\nwith a white decayed rock, which the natives call jadi mannu, and\r\nsometimes the latter so much preponderates that it looks nearly white. I\r\nam told by the natives that if you mix the red and white earth together\r\nand apply the mixture to the surface of the land it will never get\r\ndry.[54]\r\n\r\nIn concluding my remarks on soil applications, I may observe that if top\r\nsoil costs the same price as cattle manure, the former is to be preferred\r\nfor four reasons. It is much more easily handled and applied; it is a\r\nbetter substance for mixing with other manures, such as bonedust or ashes,\r\nfor instance; it has a better physical effect on the soil; and is nearly\r\nfree from weed seeds which abound in cattle manure.\r\n\r\nI may add that I have since made a calculation with the object of seeing\r\nhow, by the addition of manures to the kemmannu soil, I could make a\r\nmixture which would have all the fertilizing ingredients of farmyard\r\nmanure in addition to the advantages possessed by the soil, and which I\r\nhave just enumerated. I find that if to 83 parts of the soil I added 1\r\npart of bonedust, 12 parts of castor cake, 2 parts of potash salt, and 2\r\nparts of lime, I should make up a compost equal to good English farmyard\r\nmanure, and at but a slightly increased cost, which would be more than\r\ncovered by the special physical and other advantages arising from the use\r\nof kemmannu.\r\n\r\nThe pulp of the coffee is very apt to be carelessly treated, and it is\r\nimportant to remember that Mr. Hughes, in his \"Report on Ceylon Coffee,\r\nSoils, and Manures,\" estimates that, _if properly preserved_, two tons of\r\npulp are equal to one ton of good farmyard manure. But it must not be\r\nwashed, as it often is by being run into a pulp pit with water, or nearly\r\nall its valuable constituents would be lost. It should be mixed, he tells\r\nus, with cattle dung, or, if that is not procurable, with liberal supplies\r\nof lime, and he also suggests that it should be put under cover day by\r\nday. We have adopted on my property a plan which I think in these climates\r\nis the cheapest and best. A layer of top soil is placed in the road\r\nalongside of the coffee where we desire to use the manure; then each day's\r\npulp is carted direct to the plantation and scattered over the top soil,\r\nand more top soil added, till we have a layer as thick as we find\r\nconvenient, but of course not so thick as to prevent carts passing over it\r\nto other parts of the plantation. On these layers of pulp and top soil\r\nlime or bonedust may be sprinkled.\r\n\r\nDry fallen leaves is another local resource which should by no means be\r\nneglected, and they are commonly used for littering the cattle sheds. Such\r\nleaves are about equal to cattle dung. A sample of those we use was\r\nanalyzed by Dr. Voelcker, and the result gave 1 per cent. of phosphate of\r\nlime, 1 per cent. of ammonia, and 3/4 per cent. of potash.\r\n\r\nGreen twigs[55] cut from jungle trees are of considerable manurial value,\r\nand the natives seem well aware of the value of the different kinds. A\r\nsample of the following six kinds which are most approved of by the\r\nnatives--namely, Japel, Nairal, Ubble, Gowl, Mutty and Hunchotee, was\r\nanalyzed by Dr. Voelcker, and the result gave 1/4 per cent. phosphate of\r\nlime, 3/4 per cent. of potash, 1 per cent. of lime, and 3/4 per cent. of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nFerns are of considerable manurial value, and are rich in potash, and they\r\nshould be used to litter the cattle sheds.\r\n\r\nBurnt earth has been formerly used in Ceylon, and has been recommended by\r\nMr. Pringle for use in Coorg, but I have no experience of its use, but if\r\nit pays to use it in Coorg it would pay equally well to do so in Mysore.\r\n\r\nWood ashes are much valued in Ceylon, where they are applied at a cost of\r\n1s. 3-1/2d. a bushel. We buy ashes at 2 annas (less than 3d.) a bushel\r\ndelivered on the estate. Though costing as much as 1s. 3-1/2d. in Ceylon,\r\nMr. Hughes says they are the cheapest form in which potash can be supplied\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the ashes of the stem wood and thick branches\r\nare not nearly so valuable as those of young branches and twigs. A good\r\nsample of the last-named contains 20-1/2 per cent. of potash and more than\r\n30 per cent. of lime. In many places in the vicinity of the estates much\r\ngood manure might often be made by cutting down weeds and jungle plants of\r\nany kind, burning them, mixed with earth, slowly, and applying the mixture\r\nto the coffee.\r\n\r\nI have only heard of one planter who used night soil. He had planks\r\npierced with the necessary apertures, underneath which buckets with some\r\nsoil in each were placed; these were removed daily and emptied into\r\nrenovation pits in the coffee. Anybody depositing elsewhere was fined, and\r\nthe fine given to the Toty, who had thus an interest in looking out for\r\ndefaulters. There can be no doubt that this is an excellent system, and\r\nobviously advantageous from a sanitary point of view, and that it could\r\nwith, ease be carried out on an estate where all the coolies were of the\r\nlower castes, but it could not be carried out, and it would be very unwise\r\nto attempt it, in the case of an estate on which there are poor members of\r\nthe better castes. It is even important on such a property to see that no\r\npieces of ordinary paper find their way on to the farmyard manure heap,\r\nas, when such has been detected on my property, the women of the better\r\ncastes refused to carry out the manure.\r\n\r\nWe have now examined what I may call the local manurial resources, and I\r\npropose to consider in detail those manures which have to be imported into\r\nthe coffee districts from various quarters. Of these manures lime is one\r\nof the most important, and as three samples of soil from my property were\r\nall found to be very deficient in lime, it is probable that applications\r\nof lime are as desirable in Mysore generally as they are in the case of\r\nplantations on the Nilgiri slopes. Limestone can be procured from the\r\ninterior of Mysore, and also from the port of Mangalore. It should always\r\nbe burnt on the estate. It is a cheaper plan than having it burnt before\r\nimporting it, and we got, besides, the ashes of the wood used for burning\r\nthe lime. Lime is as valuable ground as burnt, and when it is ground is\r\nnot so liable to suffer from rain as burnt lime is. It must not be mixed\r\nwith bonedust, oil-cake, or potash salts, but should be put down some\r\nweeks before these manures. Lime should only be used in small quantities\r\nof half a ton or a ton an acre (it is usually used at the latter rate in\r\nCeylon), as a free use of it would favour the escape of ammonia from the\r\nsoil by too rapidly converting inert into active nitrogen, and, as a\r\nneighbour of mine once found, the result would probably be a heavy crop of\r\ncoffee followed by exhaustion of the tree. Lime might be advantageously\r\nused more often where the land is liable to be soured, or where much\r\nvegetable matter has accumulated. It should be remembered that, as ashes\r\ncontain about 30 per cent. of lime, we should diminish the quantity of\r\nlime when we have applied ashes. I have said that lime should be used at\r\nthe rate of half a ton to a ton an acre, but I may remind the reader that\r\nMr. Reilly had found that 4 or 5 cwt. regularly applied every three years\r\nwas enough, and as to the quantity that should be used, the planter must\r\nbe largely guided by the local experience. As lime is easily washed out of\r\nthe soil, it seems to me that more should be applied in the case of a\r\nheavy, and less with a light rainfall.\r\n\r\nBonedust has been largely, and I think, as the reader will see from my\r\nprevious remarks, very wastefully used in manuring coffee. It varies much\r\nin quality, and the purchaser would do well to obtain a guarantee as\r\nregards its genuineness. Bonedust should be mixed with fine top soil, and\r\nthen applied to the land, or it may be mixed with cattle manure, or\r\napplied as a surface dressing, but either of the two first-named methods\r\nof application is to be preferred. In 500 lbs. of bones there are, in\r\nround numbers, about 250 lbs. of phosphate of lime, which consists of 125\r\nlbs. of phosphoric acid and as many of lime. I may remind the reader that\r\n5 cwt. of parchment takes from the soil 1 lb. of lime and 1-1/2 lb. of\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nFish manure is of great value, especially in bringing rapidly on backward\r\nor sticky coffee. A sample I have had analyzed contained 7-1/3 per cent.\r\nof ammonia and nearly 9-1/2 per cent. of phosphate of lime. The whole fish\r\ncan be imported from the coast, and they should be broken up and mixed\r\nwith top soil. This is not only advantageous for distributing the manure\r\nthroughout the land when it is applied, but it is particularly necessary\r\nin the case of fish, as I have found by practical experience that, if\r\napplied whole and covered with soil, crows, kites, jackals and pigs dig\r\nthem up and carry them off.\r\n\r\nOil-cakes of various kinds have always been a favourite manure, and it is\r\na particularly desirable one, because the nitrogen in it is in a slowly\r\nconvertible form. Of all the cakes castor is said to be of the highest\r\nmanurial value (though an analysis I have had made of ground nut cakes\r\ngives a better result in nitrogen), and besides nitrogen it contains\r\nphosphate of lime, magnesia, and potash. In an analysis I had made of\r\nbrown castor oil-cake, i.e., cake made after crushing the entire seeds,\r\nthere was over 4 per cent. of phosphate of lime, or about equal to 5 per\r\ncent. had the cake been white castor, which is made after the seeds have\r\nbeen decorticated. But another sample of brown castor which was analyzed\r\nfor me, only gave a little more than 2-3/4 per cent. of phosphate of lime.\r\nFrom this difference, and from the general consideration of the\r\ndifferences of all seeds in particular seasons, and also in some degree\r\nfrom various soils, it seems to me there must often be, from natural\r\ncauses, a considerable difference in the value of cakes. The attention of\r\npurchasers should be directed to these differences; they should obtain, if\r\npossible, a guarantee as to the composition of the cakes they buy, and\r\noccasionally test the manure.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have said as to the composition of castor cake, it is probable\r\nthat white castor contains from 4 to 5 per cent. of phosphate of lime, and\r\nI desire to call particular attention to this, because oil-cake is usually\r\nregarded purely as a nitrogenous source of manure, whereas one of the\r\noil-cakes commonly used--i.e., castor cake--contains an appreciable\r\nquantity of that phosphate of lime of which bones are generally considered\r\nto be the sole suppliers by the planter. But it is evident that if we\r\nannually used 300 lbs. per acre of white castor, we should, even if it\r\ncontained only 4 per cent. of phosphate of lime, be supplying six times\r\nthe amount of lime and more than three times the amount of phosphoric acid\r\nremoved by an average crop of coffee, and though the lime is liable to\r\nloss from waste, it must be remembered that the phosphoric acid is firmly\r\nretained by the soil. It is important to remember that castor cake should,\r\nlike bones, be mixed with a considerable quantity of fine top soil, so\r\nthat the manure may be widely distributed through the soil.\r\n\r\nNitrate of potash, or saltpetre, is an extremely expensive manure, and not\r\na desirable one, because the nitrogen in it is in a too quickly\r\nassimilable form, and is very liable to be lost in drainage. But it might\r\nbe used with effect, and in small quantities, for bringing forward\r\nsupplies, and I am informed that for this purpose it has been used with\r\nadvantage in Coorg. I have used the nitrate of potash on my property--an\r\nexperimental amount only--and it caused the trees to throw out strong and\r\nnumerous shoots. It should be bought in the form of pure nitre.\r\n\r\nNitrate of soda is also liable to the objection that the nitrogen in it is\r\nin a too quickly available form, and liable to be lost. I have never used\r\nit on my property, but from observing its effect on an estate in Coorg,\r\nand the effect it had in causing the trees to throw out a fine supply of\r\nyoung wood, can see that it might be used with great effect in rapidly\r\nforcing forward worn-out coffee growing on an exhausted soil. But if used\r\nfor this purpose it should be backed up with a liberal supply of bones and\r\ncastor cake, or of bones and farmyard manure, or bones and top soil, as,\r\nif not so backed up, the result would be unsatisfactory, if not\r\ndisastrous, seeing that the nitrate of soda, if applied alone, would cause\r\nthe plant to wring out everything that was available in the soil. The\r\napplication of nitrate of soda on the estate alluded to was at the rate of\r\n2 cwt. an acre, and cost 21 rupees an acre, inclusive of the cost of\r\napplication. I saw the estate at the end of October, and the nitrate had\r\nbeen put down in March previous. The wood it had been the means of\r\nproducing was very good and strong, dark green, and abundant, and the\r\neffect of the nitrate was by no means confined to one season, for the\r\neffect of the nitrate put down the year previous was still apparent. The\r\nland here evidently was short of nitrogen, and hence the good effect of\r\nthe nitrate, but as I mentioned previously, an application of nitrate had\r\nproduced no perceptible effect on another estate belonging to the same\r\nproprietor, which had been regularly well manured with bones and cattle\r\nmanure and composts, and because, of course, the land was so well supplied\r\nwith nitrogen that the coffee required no more. In concluding my remarks\r\non the effects of nitrate of soda, I may observe that by using this\r\nmanure, unremunerative coffee might be turned into a paying estate in less\r\nthan two years, while without the aid of it, from three to four years\r\nwould be required.\r\n\r\nPotash is a manure as to which I can give no distinct information, or, at\r\nleast, only information of a negative kind. I once sent out a small\r\nquantity of the muriate of potash, but my manager could perceive no\r\neffects from it whatever, and I have been informed of an instance of its\r\nhaving been applied to an estate in Coorg at the rate of one quarter of a\r\npound a tree, or at the rate of between 3 and 4 cwt. an acre, without any\r\nperceptible effect having been produced from the application.\r\n\r\nThen it must be remembered that the quantity of potash removed by an\r\naverage crop of coffee is only 7-1/2 lbs. an acre, that potash is firmly\r\nheld by the soil, and that it is constantly being supplied in small\r\nquantities by the fallen leaves (these contain 3/4 per cent. of potash) of\r\nthe shade trees and the decomposition of stones in the soil, and in\r\napplications of farmyard manure. And with reference to the demands for\r\npotash by the tree, I may mention that I, in conjunction with a friend,\r\nendeavoured to estimate the consumption of potash by the crop, and we sent\r\nto Professor Anderson, of Glasgow, a carefully drawn sample of soil taken\r\nfrom between four coffee trees from which twelve crops of coffee had been\r\nremoved without any manure being supplied, and also a sample of virgin\r\nsoil adjacent to the coffee (soil similar in every respect except that it\r\nhad not been cropped), and asked him to spare no expense in analysis. The\r\nresult was remarkable, for the soil from which the twelve crops had been\r\ntaken was found to be very little deteriorated in anything except the\r\nquantity of lime it held, which was less than in the virgin soil. The\r\nexplanation evidently was that the leaves from the shade trees, and\r\nperhaps decomposing stones, had supplied all the potash removed by the\r\ncrops. \"Why, then,\" asked my friend, who had called on the Professor to\r\nhear the result of the investigation, \"can young coffee easily be grown on\r\nthe virgin soil, while it would come on very slowly and poorly in the soil\r\nfrom which the twelve crops of coffee had been taken?\" \"Simply,\" was the\r\nanswer, \"because the untouched virgin soil is in a beautiful physical\r\ncondition, while the soil in the plantation has been rained upon and\r\nwalked upon, and thus had its physical condition impaired.\" I need hardly\r\nadd that what I have just written is highly instructive, as it\r\ncorroborates what Sir John Lawes has said, and which I have previously\r\nquoted, as to the physical condition of the soil being of more importance\r\nthan its, strictly speaking, chemical composition, and it shows us the\r\nimportance of maintaining a perfect physical condition of the soil, partly\r\nby cultivation and partly by additions of bulk manure--farmyard\r\nmanure--top soil, and composts.\r\n\r\nTo grow young plants in old soil requires great attention to manuring and\r\npreparing the soil, so as to supply the physical and chemical requirements\r\nnecessary for the vigorous growth of the young plants. Now we know that\r\nthe plants thrive well in virgin soil, and we cannot do better than fill\r\nthe holes with it, if it can possibly be procured within any reasonable\r\ndistance. If it cannot, then the soil should be mixed with some thoroughly\r\ndecayed and dried cattle manure, mixed with bonedust, and if it is desired\r\nto rush the plant forward, a slight dressing of nitrate of potash might\r\nsubsequently be applied.\r\n\r\nCoprolites, the supposed fossilized remains of animals, which would\r\nprobably contain about 40 to 50 per cent. of phosphate of lime, have been\r\ndiscovered in Mysore, and I am informed by an executive Engineer officer\r\nin the Mysore offices that they are to be found over an area of about two\r\nsquare miles, and at about a distance of seven miles from the Maddur\r\nRailway Station on the Bangalore Mysore line. This is a highly important\r\ndiscovery, and, when developed, ought to be the means of furnishing the\r\nplanter with cheap supplies of the mineral phosphate of lime. I may\r\nmention that as one find of coprolites has been made in the province, it\r\nis highly probable that further discoveries of this valuable manure may be\r\nmade. A discovery of phosphatic nodules has also been made near\r\nTrichinopoly, in the Madras Presidency, and though not of quality\r\nsufficiently good for export to England, has been reported on by Dr.\r\nVoelcker as being good enough for use amongst the plantations of Southern\r\nIndia. A deposit has also been discovered in the Cuddapah district.\r\n\r\nWe have now glanced at all the local manurial resources at the command of\r\nthe planters, and also the manures which may be purchased at a distance\r\nfrom the plantations, and as to the latter the question now naturally\r\narises as to how the planter can best lay out his money when manuring his\r\ncoffee. Now I know of no planter in India who has knowledge enough to\r\ndecide as to how he should lay out his money. The planter knows in a\r\ngeneral way that he wants nitrogen, phosphoric acid, lime, and perhaps\r\nsome potash, but as to the most desirable and economical sources from\r\nwhich to obtain them he is unable to decide, and it is not a question,\r\neven if he called in an agricultural chemist, to be decided once for all,\r\nfor the prices of the various manures are constantly liable to change.\r\nHere, then, is a matter that should be taken up by the Government, which\r\nin this respect should follow the example of the Sussex Agricultural\r\nAssociation, the chemist of which publishes every spring the most\r\neconomical manurial mixture which the farmer can use for his various\r\npurposes. In this thinly populated country the well-to-do planters are too\r\nfew, and the humble native planters too poor, to do what is done by the\r\nrich agricultural societies of Great Britain in the way of aiding the\r\nfarmer. The societies at home are mainly composed of landlords and the\r\nricher tenants. The Government in India is the one great landlord over\r\ntwo-thirds of British India, and should perform the duties of one.\r\n\r\nIn concluding my remarks on manures, I need hardly say that it is of the\r\ngreatest importance to keep a careful record of all the manures put down,\r\nand a special manure book should be kept for this purpose, in which notes\r\nshould be kept of the effects observed. But for ready reference I have\r\nfound it most convenient to have a plan made of each field on the estate,\r\nand on one side of it a space should be left in order to enter the manures\r\napplied. The date on which the field was planted might also be entered on\r\nthe plan.\r\n\r\nFinally, I may remind the reader of the Tamul proverb which declares that\r\n\"With plenty of manure even an idiot may be a successful agriculturist,\"\r\nand may add to it the English adage, which says to the farmer, \"Never get\r\ninto debt, but if you do, let it be for manure.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of bringing round an old and neglected plantation is by no means\r\nan easy one. The first thing to be done is to see to the physical\r\ncondition of the land. This is sure to be hardened and deficient in\r\nvegetable matter, and this condition of things can only be remedied by\r\napplying large quantities of cattle manure or jungle top soil, or both.\r\nNow it will generally be found impossible to obtain enough cattle manure\r\nto fully manure even fifty acres in the year, nor, if it could be obtained\r\nin large quantities, would cattle manure have nearly such lasting effects\r\nin ameliorating the condition of the land as would applications of jungle\r\ntop soil, and besides, the latter, if procurable (which it often is), can\r\nat once be applied in large quantities, and at about one-half the cost of\r\ncattle manure, in the case, as has been previously shown, of the best top\r\nsoil, and at about the same cost in the case of the most inferior quality\r\nof top soil. It is evident, then, that great efforts should be made to\r\nprocure a supply of jungle top soil, and the best top soil could of course\r\nbe carried from a considerable distance without exceeding the cost of\r\ncattle manure. With the cattle manure or top soil, bonedust and white\r\ncastor cake should be applied at the rate of 8 cwt. an acre, and 5 cwt. of\r\nthe former to 3 cwt. of the latter; and, if the planter is in a hurry for\r\nimmediate results, he might put down a small dressing of nitrate of\r\nsoda--say 112 lbs. an acre. With the addition of the nitrate I feel\r\nconfident, after observing the results of it on one of Mr. Mangles'\r\nestates in Coorg, that a remunerative crop would be picked in about two\r\nyears after the application of the above suggested manures. I would\r\nparticularly point out that, though the land, of course, must be well dug,\r\nthe planter must not look to that alone for ameliorating the hardened\r\ncondition of the soil, for however well dug, it will, unless cattle manure\r\nor jungle top soil should be applied, speedily run together again into as\r\nhardened a condition as ever. After the soil has been thoroughly manured\r\nand ameliorated in the manner suggested, moderate annual manuring will be\r\nquite sufficient for the future, for, as I have pointed out, coffee is not\r\nan exhaustive crop, though it is essential that a considerable supply of\r\nfertilizing matter should always be present in the soil. Where top soil is\r\nnot available, red soil (kemmannu), if procurable, might be used with\r\nadvantage, and the results of the experiments previously given seem to\r\nshow that it might be even preferable to top soil.\r\n\r\nAfter such an application of manure as I have above advised, the planter\r\nmust be on his guard against producing such a heavy crop as will lead to\r\nan exhaustion of the tree, and a failure of the following crop. And should\r\nthere be reason to apprehend an over heavy crop, it must be reduced by\r\nfree handling and pruning.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a neglected plantation the trees are sure to be covered\r\nwith moss and rough dead bark, and it is of great importance to remove\r\nthis at once, and rub the trees down thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWhen manuring, always leave here and there, and at some convenient point\r\nor edge of a road, a short block of coffee un-manured, perhaps about\r\ntwelve trees, and next to that a similar block with double the dose of\r\nmanure applied to the field, and note the results. In order to have the\r\neffects of the different systems of manuring under constant observation\r\nexperiments with different manurial mixtures can be best conducted at\r\nplaces where four roads meet. I need hardly say that in the observation of\r\nresults, nothing should be left to memory, but the planter, the moment he\r\nhas observed any result, should on the spot write it in his note book. The\r\nexperiments of most importance are the following:--(1) As to the manure\r\nbest calculated to bring on vacancy plants rapidly in old and worn soil.\r\n(2) To determine the value of potash as manure. (3) To determine the best\r\ntime of year for manuring. (4) To determine how far it pays to manure\r\nlittle and often, as compared with manuring seldom but in large\r\nquantities. (5) How far the value of bones is due to their lime, and how\r\nfar to the phosphoric acid they contain; and (6) how far it would pay to\r\ntop dress old soil with earth taken from the adjacent, grass lands. Such\r\nare some of the many experiments that might usefully be tried. It would\r\nalso be useful to experiment as regards native manurial practices. For\r\ninstance, the growers of Areca nut palms, and pepper vines, make a mixture\r\nof Kemmannu, or red, or rather pink hued soil, which looks like\r\nrecently-decomposed rock, black earth, and sheep dung, and apply the\r\ncompost to their palms and pepper-vines, and it would be interesting to\r\ntry such composts in the case of coffee. It would also be interesting to\r\nexperiment with ordinary good soil taken from the grass lands. I am\r\ninformed by a native farmer that the terraces on which ragi is grown, are\r\noccasionally dressed with such soil, and that the manurial effect of it\r\nlasts for two years, but no doubt the effect is much increased by the\r\nphysical effect caused by the addition of the soil. The more I have\r\nstudied these subjects the more am I convinced that the most, economical\r\nway of keeping up coffee land from a physical and chemical point of view\r\nis one of the many secrets yet to be discovered, and I would strongly urge\r\nplanters to experiment. There is a common saying amongst farmers and\r\nplanters that they cannot afford to make experiments. This is merely the\r\nrefuge of the indolent and the ignorant. Experiments may, of course, be\r\nmade on such a scale as to be hazardous or even ruinous, but they can be\r\nmade in such a way as to be neither the one nor the other.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] I am now so satisfied with the capacity of these soils to keep\r\nthemselves cool, that I am applying them as a top dressing to land\r\ndeficient in shade and dry ridges. Since writing the above, I have\r\nascertained from my manager the interesting fact that about seven weeks\r\nafter putting down the red earth, newly grown white roots were found to be\r\nrunning all through this earth, though no rain had fallen from the time of\r\nthe application of the soil up to the time the growth of the rootlets was\r\nobserved. The adjacent land, to which virgin forest top soil had been\r\napplied, had no such growth of new rootlets, nor had any of the adjacent\r\nland, to which no top dressings had been applied. The red earth had\r\nevidently the power of taking in sufficient moisture from the atmosphere\r\nto stimulate a growth of young roots. The red earth was applied on\r\nFebruary 20th, and no rain fell till April 7th. This growth of new\r\nrootlets, I may add, was also observed in another part of the plantation\r\nto which, a top dressing of the red earth had been applied.\r\n\r\n[55] The full analyses of these leaves and twigs are given in the Appendix\r\nto Dr. Voelcker's work, \"The Improvement of Indian Agriculture,\" which\r\ncontains other analyses of interest to the planter. This important work\r\nshould, I may repeat, be in the hands of all those interested in tropical\r\ncultivations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nNURSERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of the Coorg plant, it has been customary for\r\nMysore planters to send annually to Coorg for seed, and they have always\r\nendeavoured to obtain it from the best coffee grown on the best land, and,\r\nas the results from this practice have been very satisfactory, it may seem\r\nthat no better course could be suggested. But till all courses are tried\r\nit is certainly open to doubt whether this is the best, and I am now\r\nexperimenting with seeds produced not from the richest, but from the\r\npoorest and most exposed portion of a Coorg estate (but of course neither\r\nso poor nor exposed as to be incapable of producing strong, healthy trees\r\nand sound seed), and I think it probable that seed from such trees will\r\nproduce hardier plants than can be produced from seed gathered in rich and\r\nsheltered situations. As regards the climate from which the seed should be\r\nproduced, one well-known planter, Mr. Edwin Hunt, writing in the \"Madras\r\nMail,\" Feb. 27th, 1891, says that he attaches the greatest importance to\r\nchange of seed irrespective of the poorness or richness of the soil on\r\nwhich it has been raised, and thinks change of climate does as much as\r\nchange of soil, and has for some years found it advantageous to procure\r\nseed from the wettest climate for the driest climate, and _vice versa_. I\r\nhave had no experience on this point as regards coffee, but it may be\r\ninteresting and useful from a shade-planting point of view, to note here\r\nthat I have found that seeds of the jack tree from the dry plains of the\r\ninterior produce plants which grow much more rapidly in the wet coffee\r\ndistricts than plants do which have been raised from local seed, and this\r\nnaturally raises a question, I am now experimenting on, i.e., as to\r\nwhether we should not procure coffee-seed from trees grown in the dry\r\nplains of the interior where the rainfall is less than half of that of our\r\ndriest coffee districts. I may here note that coffee can be grown in\r\nlow-lying sheltered land as far east as Bangalore if the coffee is\r\nirrigated. I was shown in 1891 coffee that looked well, and had borne\r\nwell, in Mr. Meenakshia's gardens, some miles from Bangalore. One hundred\r\nand seventy trees planted 6 x 6 ft. in 1885 gave an appreciable crop in\r\n1889, and in 1890 3 cwt. of clean coffee, or at the rate of upwards of a\r\nton an acre. When I saw the trees in July, 1891, they were looking well,\r\nand had a fair crop on them. There was no shade except a bushy tree here\r\nand there. The proprietor, encouraged by his success, had been extending\r\nhis cultivation. In the same garden I also saw cardamom plants about seven\r\nfeet high and in blossom; these had been planted eighteen months\r\npreviously. There were also some vines, grown from plants imported from\r\nCaubul, which produced large fine white grapes.\r\n\r\nIt is of course very important to select a good site for the nursery, and\r\na ready command of water is essential, as it is both costly and\r\nunsatisfactory to carry to the beds even a short distance, and the aspect\r\nshould, if possible, be northerly, as in that case very little shading is\r\nrequired if the ground is on a slope, as, if a line of trees is left at\r\nthe head of the slope, a large amount of lateral shade will be thrown on\r\nto the beds. Next to a northern an eastern aspect, if the land is\r\nlow-lying, with a hill or sloping land rising rather abruptly behind it,\r\nis by no means a bad situation, as the sun will be entirely off the land\r\nearly in the afternoon. Should the planter unfortunately have to fall\r\nback on a southern aspect, this may be aided by leaving forest trees\r\nrather thickly on the western side of the nurseries so as to shield it\r\nfrom the afternoon sun, or a line of casuarinas may be planted on the\r\nwest, and also on the southern side, so as to cast lateral shade on the\r\nnursery. A western aspect is to be deprecated, in consequence of the\r\nscorching heat of the afternoon sun.\r\n\r\nThere is a common idea, which I myself once shared, that it is always best\r\nto have your nursery on new land, but this is really not at all necessary\r\nif you renew your land by carting on to it top soil from the jungle, or\r\neven a mixture of any fresh soil that has not been trampled upon, and\r\nwhich has been mixed with cattle manure and some bone-meal. I consider it\r\nmost important to retain the same site for the nursery, because, by\r\ngrowing casuarinas to cast lateral shade on it, you can ultimately\r\ndispense with shading the nursery, as these trees run up quickly, and\r\nattain a great height. The light, too, comes readily through them, so that\r\ntheir lateral shade is most desirable, and lateral shade, it must be\r\nremembered, allows the plants to benefit by the dew fall. I may add that\r\nthe height to which the trees grow enables the planter to grow them at\r\nsuch a distance from the beds as to be practically unable to reach them\r\nwith their roots.\r\n\r\nAs regards the best time for putting down the seed, opinions and practice\r\nhave varied considerably, but it is now generally admitted that seed put\r\ndown at Christmas, which will give plants with ten leaves on them in June\r\n(the planting season) are the most suitable for new clearings. Seed put\r\ndown in September or October will give fine sturdy plants with one or two\r\npairs of branches, and these are considered to be the most suitable for\r\nvacancies in old land. In order to do full justice to the last-named\r\nplants, they should, three months before planting out, be transplanted\r\ninto small circular baskets, about the size of a small flower pot, and\r\nwith wide spaces between the wickerwork. These baskets should be filled\r\nwith a mixture of dried cattle dung and good soil; they should then be\r\nplaced on the surface of the bed and touching each other, and, when the\r\nplants are put out, they should be put down with the basket, which will\r\nthen be quite filled with a mass of fibrous roots all ready to extend\r\nthemselves into the surrounding land. When this course is pursued the\r\nplant receives no check, and its rapid growth is insured. If this method\r\nis not adopted in the case of replanting old land, or filling up vacancies\r\namongst old coffee, many plants are sure to perish, and the survivors will\r\nmake but poor progress. But in the case of virgin soil this course, though\r\nobviously a safe one, and freeing the planters from all anxiety as to a\r\nfailure in the rains, may be dispensed with. Where baskets are expensive,\r\nor difficult to procure, pieces of worn out gunny bags answer the purpose\r\nfairly well, and I have seen them used on the Nilgiri hills.\r\n\r\nThe pits for vacancy plants should be dug shortly after the monsoon, and\r\nfilled in soon after being dug, when the soil is quite dry, with a mixture\r\nof jungle top soil, bone-meal, and ordinary soil, or old, well dried\r\ncattle manure mixed with some fine bone-meal and ordinary soil. I have\r\nnever used the nitrate of potash for manuring vacancy plants, but it has\r\nbeen used in Coorg with good effect, as may be readily understood by\r\nanyone who has had any experience of that valuable manure.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may say that if the planter is not prepared to take all\r\nthe steps necessary to insure the growth of vacancy plants in old land, he\r\nhad far better not put down any at all, as he will find it to be a mere\r\nwaste of money and labour, which is often more precious than money.\r\n\r\nAs regards the important point of topping, there are considerable\r\ndifferences of opinion. I am in favour of short topping, because the\r\ncoffee thus more quickly and completely covers the ground, and the trees\r\nare more easily pruned and handled, and some planters top at from three to\r\nthree and a half feet. Others again prefer four feet, and some four feet\r\nand a half, while I know of a planter who prefers a greater height, and\r\ncuts off the lower branches of his trees so as to turn them into an\r\numbrella shape. The last practice I thought a very strange one once, but\r\ntaking rot and leaf disease into consideration, I am by no means sure\r\nthat, for our shade coffee, it is not the best, and at any rate feel quite\r\nsure that, as the lower branches in the case of highly topped trees soon\r\nbecome poor and thin, the practice of high topping, and removing some of\r\nthe lower branches, is one to be decidedly recommended, and I am now\r\nadopting it on my estate. For, in the case of our shade plantation, if the\r\ncoffee is short and thickly planted, so as to closely cover the ground,\r\nthere is necessarily a great want of ventilation, and, when this is the\r\ncase, rot must, from the great dampness of the ground, have a tendency to\r\nincrease in the monsoon, while from there being no room for the passage of\r\nair underneath the trees, the spores of the leaf disease will be preserved\r\nfrom being dried up and killed during the season of strong and parching\r\nwinds. But quite independently of these reasons, it seems to me that the\r\nsouring of the land owing to excessive saturation would be much lessened\r\nwere there free ventilation under the coffee trees. And, taking all these\r\npoints into consideration, I am now letting up all my short topped trees,\r\nwhich is easily done by letting a sucker grow from the head of the tree,\r\nand topping it when it reaches the required height. In places which are\r\nexposed, or fairly exposed, to wind, short topping would not be attended\r\nwith such disadvantages, as in the case of the land in more sheltered\r\nsituations, but for all sheltered situations it certainly seems to me\r\nthat, with reference to the limitation of rot, leaf disease and the\r\nsouring of the land, the trees should be topped at not less than four feet\r\nand a half.\r\n\r\nThe trees should not be topped until after the blossom comes out, as the\r\nresult of topping at an earlier period would be to cause the trees to\r\nthrow out a heavy crop on the primary branches, and more suckers, and so\r\ncause more trouble and expense in handling. It should be remembered, too,\r\nthat in the case of all young plants if, before the first blossom, you cut\r\nthe top, you check the growth of the roots. When topping, remove one of\r\nthe topmost pair of branches as, if both are left, a split in the top of\r\nthe stem is liable to occur. Should waiting until after the bursting of\r\nthe blossom cause the tree to grow so high as to be affected by wind, the\r\ntop may be pinched off by hand, and the tree afterwards topped at the\r\nproper height. This is often necessary in the case of shaded coffee, which\r\nis, of course, liable to be drawn up.\r\n\r\nI have said that the evil of topping before blossom is, that a heavy crop\r\nis thereby thrown out on the primary branches, and I know of nothing more\r\ninjurious to the young tree, or more certain to throw it out of shape, as\r\nthe branch shrinks, and the tendency then is for the strongest secondary\r\nbranch to take the lead. A judicious and full-pursed planter, it is true,\r\nwould either remove the whole of the maiden crop, or at least from the\r\nthree upper pairs of primaries, but the crop of the fourth year is apt to\r\nfind a young planter with empty pockets, and he may not be able to afford\r\nthe sacrifice; but he should in any case remove the immature berries, or\r\nblossom buds, from the greenwood of the primary branches, and if he\r\nrefrains from topping before blossom, his trees may stand their maiden\r\ncrop fairly well. But if the maiden crop threatens to be a heavy one it\r\nshould certainly be lessened, as the following year there would be little\r\ncrop, and much growth of superfluous wood, and an over heavy crop the\r\nsucceeding year, and so on continuously. The trees would thus be thrown\r\ninto the habit of giving heavy alternate crops, which is most injurious to\r\nthe plant which, like all other fruit-yielding plants, should be worked so\r\nas to give even, moderate crops every year. But is it not evident that a\r\nheavy crop followed by a small crop and much superfluous growth must be\r\nextremely bad? for the trees thus produce an over heavy crop of berries\r\none year, and an exhaustive crop of shoots and suckers during the next,\r\nand thus call for an extra expenditure of labour.\r\n\r\nIt is very important, by what is called handling, to keep the tree clear\r\nof shoots within six inches of the stem, and to remove all cross shoots\r\nand suckers and thin out superfluous wood as soon as possible. For we must\r\nconstantly keep in mind that a given weight of leaves is as exhaustive to\r\nthe tree as a given weight of berries. Prompt handling, and the removal of\r\nsuckers, is also very necessary for the free ventilation of the tree, and\r\nespecially during the monsoon months. I would call particular attention to\r\nthe bearing that judicious and timely handling has on rot and leaf\r\ndisease, as these are both much encouraged if the tree, at the beginning\r\nof the monsoon, has much immature foliage. We should handle them (and\r\nprune too, as is subsequently pointed out) so as to meet the monsoon as\r\nmuch as possible with well ripened leaves, and this can obviously be best\r\ndone by preserving all the September and October shoots we can, and\r\nremoving all the February shoots that the tree can spare. In connection\r\nwith this subject, I would strongly advise planters to study Mr. Marshall\r\nWard's third Report on leaf disease in Ceylon, to which I have elsewhere\r\nreferred, and would particularly call attention to what he urges as to the\r\nadvisability of giving every leaf that is to be preserved as long a life\r\nas possible, in order that it may feed the tree for the greatest possible\r\nlength of time.\r\n\r\nIn our climate, anything approaching to heavy pruning is regarded as an\r\nabomination, and the general opinion is now in favour of shortening back\r\nlong drooping primaries, removing cross shoots and wood that is not likely\r\nto bear anything more, and thinning out overgrowths of new wood. The most\r\nluxuriantly wooded part of the plantation should be pruned first, and the\r\nsticky coffee last, because, in the first place, it is important to stop\r\nthe growth of superfluous wood as soon as possible, and in the second\r\ncase, time will be given to the sticky coffee to throw out new shoots, so\r\nthat the pruner can see exactly where to apply the knife, which is often a\r\nmatter of difficulty, if he is dealing with trees quite exhausted from\r\nbearing a heavy crop, or from the land being insufficiently manured. It is\r\nvery important to pare closely off the spikes left after cutting off a\r\nsecondary branch, so that the bark may heal over the junction of the\r\nbranch with the parent branch, as, if this is not done, the free\r\ncirculation of the sap is checked. It runs up the branches, and, of\r\ncourse, cannot readily get on when it meets with a spike of wood sticking\r\nout of the branch. This spike or stump may be green or half or quite dead,\r\nbut whatever state it is in the free circulation of the sap will be\r\nchecked, and the quantity of sap in circulation for the benefit of the\r\nmain branch will be lessened.\r\n\r\nThe time for pruning trees is obviously of great importance. Our present\r\npractice is to prune as soon after the crop as possible, and no doubt this\r\nfollows the rule as regards all fruit tree culture, which is, that the\r\ntrees, from the time of blossoming till up to the picking of the crop,\r\nshould not be interfered with. But pruning at that time causes the tree to\r\nthrow out much young wood which in the beginning of the monsoon is in an\r\nimmature state, and, as Mr. Ward has pointed out (_vide_ p. 389), this\r\nsucculent foliage is a good breeding ground for leaf disease. Mr. Brooke\r\nMockett, too (_vide_ p. 401), has pointed out that leaf disease is worst\r\nin the case of trees which have been heavily pruned, and obviously because\r\nthe heavier the pruning the greater the supply of succulent foliage. Such\r\nsucculent foliage, too, is liable to be rotted away in the drenching rains\r\nof the south-west monsoon. So that, taking all the points into\r\nconsideration, it is obvious that pruning should be so managed as to\r\nincrease mature foliage, and, as much as possible, limit the amount of\r\nsucculent foliage, at the beginning of the monsoon. How this object is to\r\nbe attained it is difficult to see, but we can certainly do something\r\ntowards attaining it by very light pruning; and I would suggest here that\r\nplanters should make experiments both in pruning and manuring, with the\r\nview of growing the young wood earlier in the season. And I would suggest\r\nthat planters might set aside say an acre, and leave the trees untouched\r\nat the usual pruning season, and confine their pruning to removing useless\r\nwood at the end of the monsoon. This, I surmise, would have the effect of\r\nthrowing out new wood then, which would be mature at the beginning of the\r\nmonsoon. Such experimental plots should not be manured after crop, but\r\nshould be manured immediately after the monsoon. It certainly seems to me\r\nthat, if we could both manure and prune at the end of the monsoon, we\r\nshould attain, as far as it can be attained, the production of mature wood\r\nand leaves at the beginning of the monsoon.\r\n\r\nSome planters, when pruning, remove moss and rub down the trees at the\r\nsame time, but this, I am sure, can be done more cheaply and effectually\r\nas a separate work.\r\n\r\nThe removal of moss and rough bark, and generally cleaning and rubbing\r\ndown the trees is a work of very great importance, and should be carried\r\nout once every two or three years. The injury arising from moss is too\r\nwell known to call for any remark, but the reason why the removal of rough\r\nbark, and especially rough bark at the head of the tree, and at the\r\njunction of the topmost branches with the stem is of such importance is,\r\nthat it is in the crevices of the rough bark that the Borer fly lays its\r\neggs. When thus removing the moss and rough bark, the eggs may often be\r\ndestroyed, and in the absence of rough bark to shelter them, it is\r\nprobable that the insect would probably not lay the eggs at all, or that,\r\nif it did, they would either become addled, or fall to the ground. I may\r\nadd here that we have found a piece of square tin the best thing for\r\nscraping down the trees, and that the hair-like fibre of the sago palm is\r\nan excellent thing for rubbing down the stems.\r\n\r\nThough moss thrives best in damp situations, and on northern aspects, it\r\nsometimes exists on open and eastern aspects, and, when the latter is the\r\ncase, the moss is certainly due to poverty of soil, and in such cases, in\r\naddition to scraping the trees thoroughly, an application of top soil\r\nmixed with lime, or bonedust, should be applied to the land. I may add\r\nthat I have seen trees on a dry knoll, and with no shade over head,\r\ncovered with moss, and this was no doubt owing to poverty of soil, which\r\ncaused the bark to be in an unhealthy condition, and therefore a suitable\r\nhome for the growth and spread of moss.\r\n\r\nDigging and working the soil in order to keep it in an open condition is\r\nof great importance, because, to use for the second or third time the\r\nwords of Sir John Lawes, \"it is the physical condition of the soil, its\r\npermeability to roots, its capacity for absorbing and radiating heat, and\r\nfor absorbing and retaining water, that is more important than its\r\nstrictly speaking chemical condition.\" In other words, a moderately\r\nfertile soil, if maintained in fine physical condition, will give better\r\nresults than a rich one which is in a hardened state. But to keep the\r\nsoil in good condition, and yet comply with the fruit cultivators' chief\r\naxiom that, \"from the time of blossom till the crop is ripe the roots\r\nshould not be disturbed,\" is a matter of great difficulty--I might almost\r\nindeed say an impossibility. For, from the trampling of the people in\r\ntheir passage up and down the lines, and the dash of the rain, the soil\r\nbecomes exceedingly hard immediately after, or at least very shortly after\r\nthe rain. Here, then, the planter finds himself between the devil and the\r\ndeep sea. Is he to leave his soil in a hardened state from the beginning\r\nof November to the end of January, or perhaps the middle of February, or\r\nis he to violate the axiom which tells him not to disturb the roots till\r\nafter the crop is ripened? And here I think the condition of things is\r\nsuch that he should come to a compromise, and dig up at the end of the\r\nmonsoon a space of about 2 to 2-1/2 feet up the centre of the lines, which,\r\nbeing the part always walked upon, is necessarily liable to be puddled and\r\nhardened, and then, after crop-picking is finished, lightly dig, or pick\r\nover and stir, the remainder of the soil, breaking, of course, all clods\r\nat the same time. By such a process we should prevent the central portion\r\ndrying up and cracking, and aerate laterally the rest of the soil, and at\r\nthe same time do as little damage as possible to the roots. I need hardly\r\nsay that it is of great importance to begin with all those places where\r\nthe soil is most hardened, as, should the planter not be able, from\r\nshortness of labour, to complete his digging before crop, he will at least\r\nhave dug those places most urgently in need of cultivation. If the soil of\r\nthe estate is pretty even in character, the hottest aspects will of course\r\nharden soonest, and should be dug first, but it may so happen that a hot\r\naspect may have a soil of a loose and open character, while a north aspect\r\nmight have a soil of stiff character, and here the planter must alter the\r\nrule so as to suit his particular case.\r\n\r\nFor digging, or rather loosening the soil at the end of the monsoon, my\r\nexperience is that the four-pronged Assam fork is the best tool, and that\r\nfor the light picking over of the whole of the soil after crop a light\r\ntwo-pronged digger is best. This last tool is shaped like a mamoty, but\r\nwith two prongs rather widely set apart instead of the broad blade of the\r\nmamoty. It being very light, it can easily be turned in the hand, so that\r\nclods may be broken with the back of the tool, and it can be used by\r\nwomen, which of course is of great advantage for pushing forward the work.\r\n\r\nRenovation pits, as they are called, were once regarded as an excellent\r\nmeans of deeply stirring the soil, but, of recent years, have fallen out\r\nof favour with many planters, and I think justly so. These pits, or rather\r\ntrenches, are dug in the spaces between four trees, and are generally\r\nabout fifteen inches in depth, as many in width, and about ten feet long.\r\nWeeds and rubbish were thrown into them, and when they were filled with\r\nthese, and soil washed into them, the pits were abandoned and another set\r\nopened. I am now satisfied that these pits did much damage by the\r\nsub-soil--which is often of an undesirable quality, and always, of course,\r\nmore liable to run together and harden than the original top soil--being\r\nthrown on to the surface of the land. In fact, they did the same damage\r\nthat the steam plough has often done at home in unskilful hands, i.e.,\r\nturned a fine loose surface soil into one of an inferior character. Then\r\nthe sides and edges of the pits harden and crack, and this of course adds\r\nto the heat of the plantation. But renovation pits may be put to an\r\nexcellent use if employed in their character of water-holes, as they are\r\ncalled by the natives, and whenever land is liable to wash, they are of\r\ngreat service, and, though but small portions of our shaded plantations\r\nare ever liable to wash, a line of renovation pits should always be put on\r\nthe lower sides of roads to catch the water that runs off them, and thus\r\ncause it to soak gradually into the soil. When renovation pits are used as\r\nwater-holes no new ones should be opened, but the old pit should be\r\ncleaned out and its contents scattered on the surface of the land, not\r\nbetween the rows of coffee, as the soil would at once run into the\r\nrenovation pits below, but around the stems of the coffee trees and in the\r\nlines. I have found that renovation pits, or water-holes, are of great\r\nvalue as water conservators, and wherever it is necessary to increase the\r\nsupply of water for a tank, deep water-holes--say from 3 to 4 feet in\r\ndepth and width--should be dug around the upper sides of the tank, and the\r\nrain water conducted into them by small channels. We have found, on my\r\nproperty, such an appreciable effect from even a moderate amount of such\r\nholes, that I am now largely increasing their number. A friend of mine has\r\nalso found a similar effect in connection with his tank, though, I may\r\nmention, he had made the pits in connection with his coffee, and not with\r\nthe view of increasing the water supply in his tank. I believe that this\r\nmethod of increasing the water supply would be well worth the attention of\r\nGovernment in connection with its numerous tanks.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that I have recommended applications of jungle\r\ntop soil and other soil, and it should be remembered that such\r\napplications will, by rendering the soil more open, much lighten the work\r\nof digging, and this is a point that should be carefully estimated when\r\ncalculating the expense of dressing the land with fresh soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE DISEASES OF COFFEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough coffee in Mysore is liable to two diseases, and to the attack of\r\none insect, these, when the cultivation is good, and the shade suitable in\r\nkind and degree, are not likely to cause any uneasiness in the minds of\r\nthe planters. But it is, of course, necessary to go carefully into the\r\nwhole subject of these diseases and the insect attack, in order to bring\r\nout fully the steps that should be taken so to cultivate and shade the\r\ncoffee as to render these evils as innocuous as possible, and I have\r\ntherefore, in addition to my own knowledge, taken pains specially to\r\nprocure from two planters of long practical experience their views. The\r\nviews, I may say, of Mr. Graham Anderson as regards leaf disease are\r\nparticularly valuable, as he has paid much attention to the subject.\r\n\r\nLeaf disease is the common name given to the attack of _Hemeleïa\r\nVastatrix_, a fungoid plant which distributes its spores in the form of a\r\nyellow powder. These alight on the leaves of coffee, and in weather\r\nfavourable to the fungus, will germinate in about a day, and the fungoid\r\nplant then roots itself between the walls of the leaves. After the plant\r\nhas completed its growth, which it generally does in about three weeks,\r\nmore spores are produced to fly away with the wind, or be scattered by the\r\nmovements of the coolies amongst the coffee, and thus the disease spreads.\r\nA great deal, of course, has been written about it, and those who desire\r\nmore particular information may refer to Mr. Marshall Ward's report on\r\ncoffee loaf disease in Ceylon. It is sufficient to say here that when the\r\nattack is severe the tree is deprived of its leaves, or of a large number\r\nof them; that much injury to the crop results; and that both the tree and\r\nthe soil are heavily taxed in replacing the foliage that has been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nLeaf disease has probably existed[56] in Mysore as long as coffee has, but\r\nwas, from the small amount of it, so entirely unnoticed, that, when I\r\nwrote my chapter on coffee in the \"Experiences of a Planter,\" more than\r\ntwenty-two years ago, I had never heard of it, nor, I am sure, had any of\r\nmy neighbours. A trick, however, I once played on Mr. Graham Anderson's\r\ncousin about thirty years ago, enables me to trace it backwards so far\r\nwith certainty. On coming through his plantation on one occasion, I picked\r\noft a very large yellow coffee leaf, and placed it below the first of\r\nseveral plates with the aid of which he was helping his visitors. When the\r\nservant lifted the first plate, there was the leaf, and I said to my\r\nfriend, \"There are your golden prospects.\" Many years afterwards Mr.\r\nGraham Anderson recalled the incident to my memory, and said, \"That was\r\nthe leaf disease.\" But it was not till leaf disease appeared in Ceylon in\r\na severe form that our attention was called to the subject, and since then\r\nleaf disease has undoubtedly increased, and, in the opinion of one of the\r\ntwo experienced planters I have consulted, has caused much loss directly\r\nand indirectly, while the other informs me it has caused much loss on some\r\nestates. But I confess my own observation causes great doubts in my own\r\nmind as to whether the losses of leaves which planters attribute to leaf\r\ndisease are entirely owing to that cause, and I was much struck with what\r\nMr. Reilly, of Hillgrove Estate, Coonoor, said to me on the subject; and\r\nwhen we were discussing leaf disease in general, he observed that it was\r\noften said to be the cause of leaves falling off, when their doing so was\r\nreally owing to an over heavy crop of coffee. Then with our dry east winds\r\nmany leaves become yellow and fall off, and some become so because they\r\nhave been injured by the pickers, others from rot, and others from old\r\nage, and all these leaf losses are commonly put down to leaf disease, so\r\nthat, taking all these points into consideration, I find myself quite\r\nunable to determine, even approximately, the amount of loss arising from\r\n_Hemeleïa Vastatrix_.\r\n\r\nBut of one thing, however, I do feel absolutely certain, and that is, that\r\nwhen the land is well cultivated, manured, and judiciously shaded with\r\ngood caste trees, leaf disease may be reduced to such a degree that we\r\nneed not trouble ourselves about it, and I feel equally sure that the most\r\nimportant of all the agents for controlling and limiting the disease is\r\nthe shade of good caste trees. And as to the effect of shade upon\r\n_Hemeleïa Vastatrix_, I made particular inquiries when visiting estates in\r\n1891 on the slopes of the Nilgiris, and conversing with planters on the\r\nsubject. One manager went so far as to say that there was no leaf disease\r\nunder the shade trees. Mr. Reilly, of Hillgrove Estate, said there was\r\nmuch less leaf disease under the shade trees. Another planter of great\r\nexperience told me that leaf disease begins on the coffee in the open, and\r\nthen spreads into even the finest trees under shade, but that those are\r\naffected in less degree. \"In the end,\" he said, \"You see the estate all\r\nyellow, but with green patches of coffee under the shade trees.\" In short,\r\nI found that all the planters I consulted were agreed in saying that there\r\nwas but a small amount of leaf disease under the shade trees. The estates\r\non the Nilgiri slopes have been originally all in the open, but latterly\r\nshade has been encouraged on some estates, but not to a degree which in\r\nMysore would be called shade. However, the shade was quite sufficient, as\r\nwe have seen, to illustrate the important fact that shade can control leaf\r\ndisease. And as shade can control leaf disease, I need hardly say that it\r\nis of the utmost importance (just as it is as regards Borer), to carefully\r\nfill up at once all spots where shade is deficient, because this\r\ndeficiency encourages leaf disease, and forms a breeding ground for spores\r\nto fly into the surrounding coffee. Open spots here and there may not\r\nstrike one at first sight as being of much importance, but if they are all\r\nadded together, the planter will see that they will amount to a\r\nconsiderable area of land, and quite sufficient, at any rate, to inoculate\r\nhis plantation with leaf disease.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that I have said that leaf disease may be reduced\r\nwithin practically speaking harmless limits if the coffee is judiciously\r\nshaded with good caste shade trees, and I would call particular attention\r\nto the term good caste trees, because bad caste shade trees will not\r\ncontrol leaf disease. On the contrary, Mr. Graham Anderson informs me that\r\nhe has seen worse leaf disease under a dense covering of bad shade trees\r\nthan he has in the open, and he also informs me that, though shade is the\r\nbackbone of our success in Mysore, he has had more misfortune from all\r\ncauses when his estate was under the heavy shade of bad caste trees than\r\nhe has ever had since, though many places are not yet properly covered\r\nwith the good kind of shade trees which he had planted to take the place\r\nof the bad ones he had removed. I am much indebted to Mr. Graham Anderson\r\nfor information on the subject of leaf disease, and he has been kind\r\nenough to enumerate the following conditions under which leaf disease is\r\nliable to occur in the cases of good soils under good shade:\r\n\r\n\"In the case of good soils under good shade trees,\" writes Mr. Graham\r\nAnderson, \"leaf disease is liable to occur under the following\r\ncircumstances, or at the following times:\r\n\r\n\"1. From the soil being saturated at some critical period of growth,\r\nparticularly just when secondary growth commences in September.\r\n\r\n\"2. During the time when the plants are maturing a heavy crop.\r\n\r\n\"3. After the plants have been exhausted by ripening a heavy crop.\r\n\r\n\"4. After heavy weeds--particularly if late in the season.\r\n\r\n\"5. After a heavy digging where roots have been cut.\r\n\r\n\"6. After pruning without manure having been applied, or from want of\r\ndigging.[57]\r\n\r\n\"7. Even after manuring when the trees have large succulent roots in an\r\nimmature condition--generally a sign that fibrous surface roots are\r\ndeficient, and that large, deep-feeding roots are present in excess.\r\n\r\n\"8. After large quantities of green or rotting weeds have been deeply\r\nburied, or large quantities of acid, unrotted, or forcing manures have\r\nbeen applied.\r\n\r\n\"Leaf disease is also liable to occur:\r\n\r\n\"1. In poor gravelly soils, and on land which has caked in the hot\r\nweather, or become unmanageable during rain.\r\n\r\n\"2. On land where ill-balanced manurial preparations have been used.\r\n\r\n\"3. In soils suffering from a deficiency of the available supply of\r\nphosphates and alkalies.\r\n\r\n\"4. Under unsuitable shade trees.\"\r\n\r\nNow it is to be observed that these are preventable causes, or\r\naggravations of leaf disease, and, if carefully attended to, the planter\r\nwill have little to apprehend from leaf disease. Mr. Anderson, in his\r\ncommunication to me, lays, and very rightly, particular stress on the\r\nmaintenance of the physical condition of the land and its state of\r\nfertility. And it is satisfactory to find that he is exactly confirmed by\r\nMr. H. Marshall Ward in his third report (dated 1881) on coffee leaf\r\ndisease in Ceylon, and he points out (p. 3) that \"Leaf disease appears to\r\naffect different estates in different degrees on account of varieties in\r\nsoil, climate, and other physical peculiarities.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he continues, \"I would draw particular attention to this. Careful\r\ncultivation and natural advantages of soil, climate, etc., enable certain\r\nestates to stand forth prominently, as though leaf disease did not affect\r\nthem, or only to a slight extent, while poor nutrition, the ravages of\r\ninsects, etc., have in other cases their effects as well as leaf disease.\"\r\nOr, in other words, he states that, as was suggested to me by Mr.\r\nReilly--a planter of long experience near Coonoor on the Nilgiris--that\r\nmuch loss of leaves, which has been attributed to leaf disease, is often\r\ndue to other causes.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke Mockett--one of the planters previously alluded to--informs me\r\nthat \"Leaf disease is certainly worst (1) on trees that are cropping\r\nheavily, (2) on trees that have been severely pruned (heavy pruning being\r\nruination in my opinion), (3) on plants under bad caste shade trees (these\r\nplants it seems to cripple), and (4) on plants in the open.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the Coorg plant is not nearly so liable to\r\nattacks of leaf disease as the original Mysore Chick plant. I have seen a\r\ntall plant of the latter variety heavily attacked, while a Coorg plant\r\npartly under it was only slightly attacked on the side next the Chick\r\nplant, and hardly at all on the side not under the Chick plant. I observe,\r\ntoo, from the Planting Correspondent's Notes in the \"Madras Mail\" of\r\nJanuary 30th, 1892, that the same thing has been observed in Coorg, and\r\nthat occasional Mysore plants, which had by some accident found their way\r\ninto the Coorg coffee, got the disease first, and that it then spread into\r\nthe surrounding coffee.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that leaf disease does not kill the tree, but\r\nonly injures it, and diminishes its powers by depriving it of much of its\r\nfoliage, so that there is nothing alarming in leaf disease when it is\r\ncontrolled by good management of the tree, and good shade, cultivation of\r\nthe soil, and manuring; and the only case I can hear of where anything\r\nlike permanent injury has occurred, is where the disease has existed under\r\nthe shade of bad caste trees. But it is far otherwise with the justly\r\ndreaded Borer insect, which, however, can, as we shall see, be effectively\r\ncontrolled by good shade. To the attacks of this insect I now propose to\r\ndirect the attention of the reader.\r\n\r\nThe too well-known coffee Borer is a beetle, about as large as a horsefly,\r\nwhich lays its eggs in any convenient crevice, and generally, it is\r\nsupposed, near the head of the tree, in the bark, or wood of the coffee\r\ntree. After the larvæ are hatched they at once burrow their way into the\r\ntree, where they live on the dead matter of the inner or heart-wood of the\r\nstem, and there they reside from, it is supposed, three to five months,\r\ntill their transformation into winged beetles. Then they bore their way\r\nout of the tree, and fly away to carry on their mischievous work. This\r\ninsect has been declared to be, by Mr. John Keast Lord, \"a beetle of the\r\nsecond family of the Coleoptera Cerambycidæ, and to be closely allied to a\r\nsomewhat common species known as the wasp-beetle (_Clytus avietis_),\r\nwhich usually undergoes its changes in old dry palings.\" And in a\r\ncollection made by M. Chevrolat in Southern India, and now in the British\r\nMuseum (at least it was so in 1867, when Mr. Lord investigated the point),\r\na specimen was found, to which the name of _Xylotrechus quadrupes_ was\r\nattached. This Borer, like the leaf disease, has probably always attacked\r\ncoffee, but the earliest probable notice of it is to be found in Mr.\r\nStokes's Report on the Nuggur Division of Mysore, in about 1835, where he\r\nobserves that coffee trees in dry seasons often wither and snap off\r\nsuddenly at the root. The cause, or probable cause of this he does not\r\nstate, but there can be little doubt that the Borer had attacked the trees\r\nalluded to. Since then the Borer seems to have attracted little or no\r\nattention till towards the end of 1866, but about that time, and during\r\nthe three following years, an alarming attack of Borer took place, and\r\ninflicted immense injury on plantations, and there can be no doubt that\r\nthis was in a great measure owing partly to insufficient shade, and partly\r\nto bad caste shade trees, accompanied by dry, hot seasons, which were\r\nfavourable to the hatching of the eggs of this destructive insect. But\r\nsince then much attention has been paid to shade, both as to quantity and\r\nkind, and the Borer may now be regarded as an insect which can with\r\ncertainty be held in check if the land is properly shaded with good caste\r\ntrees. And I say good caste trees, because bad caste trees encourage\r\nBorers, and Mr. Graham Anderson, who has had a very large and disagreeable\r\nexperience of the effects of bad caste trees, informs me that he has \"seen\r\nworse Borer under dense _bad_ caste shade than in open places in good soil\r\non northern slopes.\" \"Some bad shade trees,\" he continues, in his\r\ncommunication to me on the subject, \"keep the coffee in a debilitated\r\nstate. They allow it to be parched up in the dry weather, and they smother\r\nit in the monsoon. They rob it of moisture and manure with their myriads\r\nof surface-feeding roots, and prevent dew and light showers benefiting the\r\nplant. I do not fear Borer under well-regulated shade of approved\r\ndescriptions. Renovation pits left open in the hot weather, large\r\nclod-digging in a light soil even under fair shade, weeds left standing in\r\ndry weather; all these, by increasing evaporation, tend to cause increase\r\nof damage from Borer. A hard caked surface, or a compact, undug soil is\r\nequally bad. Rubbing and cleaning the stems is a valuable operation,\r\nbecause it removes rough bark in which eggs may be deposited, and\r\ncontributes to the health of the tree. The prompt removal and burning of\r\nall affected trees, properly arranged shade of selected varieties,\r\nfrequent light stirring of the surface soil, having well arranged shoots\r\ndistributed all over the coffee trees, not opening the centre of the trees\r\ntoo much, and keeping the trees succulent and vigorous by culture and\r\nmanure, may be at present classed among the best remedies for the Borer\r\npest.\" In other words, he would say that the Borer loves dry wood. Keep\r\nyour coffee tree green and succulent and well shaded, and you have little\r\nto fear from it.\r\n\r\nI have also obtained the opinion of Mr. Brooke Mockett, who informs me\r\nthat \"Borer is certainly as destructive under bad caste trees as in the\r\nopen.\" \"Borer,\" he continues, in his communication to me on the subject,\r\n\"is always much worse in land where there has been a burn than in unburnt\r\nland. It is also bad in rocky and stony places. In good soil, where there\r\nhas been no burn, I have never had Borer severely, even though for a time\r\nthere has been no shade whatever. I do not fear Borer now that such an\r\nexcellent system of shade raising has been discovered. Rubbing stems once\r\nin about three years I look upon as of great use.\"\r\n\r\nI too have had great experience of Borer, and agree with what my friends\r\nhave written on the subject, with the exception of what Mr. Graham\r\nAnderson has said as to the advisability of promptly removing and burning\r\nall bored trees. This I am aware is the common practice, but I have never\r\ncarried it out on my property, and yet, though the trees were riddled with\r\nBorer in the great Borer years, and I have had since then a fair\r\nproportion of it on some part of my property, I believe that no estate has\r\nless Borer now. Instead of removing the bored trees I removed the Borer\r\nitself with the aid of the shade of good caste trees, and especially, I\r\nbelieve, by paying strict attention to what I have particularly enforced\r\nin my shade section--the prompt filling up of every spot in the plantation\r\nthat called for more shade. For it is in such spots that the Borer first\r\nlocates itself, and then it spreads to other dried up trees in the\r\nplantation. There is little use, I think, in removing the affected trees.\r\nYou must remove the cause of their being affected, because, if you do not,\r\nthe _sound_ trees that are insufficiently shaded will in time be affected:\r\nand then it must be remembered that the Borer is a winged insect which, as\r\nlong as you leave suitable ground for it, will be sure to make its\r\nappearance. Out of curiosity I lately cut down and carefully examined a\r\ncoffee tree which I could see, from the appearance of the bark, had once\r\nbeen heavily bored, but which I felt certain had no Borer now, nor any\r\nrecent attack of it. The tree I found, after a careful dissection, had not\r\na sign of Borer present in it, nor any sign of a recent attack, and yet in\r\nyears gone by it had been heavily attacked and bored literally from end to\r\nend of the stem. The explanation was that the land had formerly not been\r\nsufficiently shaded, while now the shade is ample. The Borers had then\r\nleft the trees, and their descendants had either not thought it worth\r\nwhile to lay any eggs on them, or the eggs had, from the lowered\r\ntemperature caused by the shade, become addled. Many years ago I remember\r\ncutting down a fine coffee tree, when the round gimlet-made looking hole\r\nthrough which the insect makes its escape was plainly to be seen, when I\r\nfound that a single Borer had drilled a hole down a part of the centre of\r\nthe tree, then passed into the fly state and left the tree. It was a fine\r\nsucculent and nourishing tree, and would, in all probability, have not\r\nagain been attacked. To remove, then, all attacked trees, as some planters\r\ndo, seems to me to be a great waste. To do so will not prevent other\r\nBorers arriving from some quarter or other to continue the deadly work;\r\nbut shade, if it does not prevent their arrival, either prevents the\r\ninsect from laying its eggs, from instinctively feeling that the ground is\r\nunsuitable for their being hatched, or causes the eggs to become addled.\r\nBut whatever the cause may be, it is certain that succulent trees in well\r\nshaded land will not suffer from Borer, while it is equally certain that\r\ncoffee trees in a dried up state, and with either insufficient shade, or\r\nshade of bad caste trees over them, are certain to be attacked by Borer\r\nagain and again, and will eventually be killed.\r\n\r\nI turn, lastly, to the consideration of a disease in coffee which is\r\npopularly known by the name of rot, and scientifically as _pellicularia\r\nkoleroga_, a fungoid plant which crawls over the leaves and seals up their\r\nbreathing pores, till at last the leaf dies, as man does, from want of\r\nbreath. On one of my estates we have had a considerable experience of it,\r\nand, whatever may cause rot, I feel sure that what aggravates it, and\r\ncauses it to be very injurious, is the want of free circulation of air\r\nover the land, and through the coffee trees; and I am the more convinced\r\nof this because we have found rot worse in the open, and where there was\r\nlittle undecayed vegetable matter present in the soil, than in rather\r\nthick shade with abundance of undecayed vegetable matter on the surface.\r\nBut in the latter case the land is on a rather high ridge exposed to the\r\nconstant winds of the south-west monsoon, while in the former case the\r\nland was in a hollow under a hill which lies between it and the west--a\r\nhollow completely sheltered from the wind. And it is in such sheltered\r\nspots that we find rot worse, and quite independently of the presence or\r\nabsence of shade or of vegetable matter lying on the land. To check rot,\r\nthen, the free circulation of air is necessary both over the land and\r\nthrough the plant. Much may be done in the first case by judiciously\r\nopening channels for air through the shade trees so as to admit a free\r\ncirculation of air into hollows, and much in the latter by freely handling\r\nout the centres of the trees which, in the monsoon, and especially in\r\nhollows, are apt to grow a superabundance of young wood, which chokes up\r\nthe centre of the tree and thus hinders the free circulation of air. The\r\nsoil, too, is often excessively saturated in these hollows, and, where\r\nthis is the case, the land should be surface drained. Though I have not as\r\nyet adopted the plan of sweeping up and putting into the manure heap, or\r\nburying with a little lime added, the numerous dead leaves that are apt to\r\ndrift into hollows, I feel sure that either of these plans would be\r\nattended with advantage, by lessening damp, and allowing a free\r\ncirculation of air over the land. I am confident, I may add here, that the\r\nremoval of the lower branches of the coffee trees, branches which in any\r\ncase bear hardly anything in well-shaded land, would be of great advantage\r\nin lessening the damp in the plantation, and so diminishing the causes\r\nthat promote rot.\r\n\r\nWith reference to rot, it is of great importance to thin out young wood as\r\nearly as possible, so that, when the rot season arrives, the trees may\r\nhave a moderate amount of well-matured young wood, with fully-developed\r\nhardened leaves, instead of a largo number of small succulent shoots\r\ncovered with succulent leaves, which are very apt to be rotted bodily\r\naway. And the importance of this is equally great with reference to leaf\r\ndisease, and Mr. Ward, in his \"Report\" (p. 15), points out that pruning\r\nand manuring should be so timed that the tree may have, at the beginning\r\nof the wet weather, mature wood and leaves, and the whole of his\r\nobservations on this head point to the conclusion that manuring ought to\r\nbe carried out at the close of the monsoon, and that pruning, which\r\nencourages the growth of much young wood, should be limited as much as\r\npossible to the removal of utterly useless, worn-out wood. Under the head\r\nof pruning and handling, the reader will find some remarks with reference\r\nto the important subject of the best time for pruning so as to limit rot\r\nand leaf disease.\r\n\r\nI am glad to say that I have no other pests to chronicle as regard Mysore\r\nestates, but as estates on the Nilgiris sometimes suffer from green-bugs,\r\nI give the following treatment, which was discovered, and has been\r\neffectually used by Mr. Reilly of Hill Grove Estate, Coonoor, who has\r\nkindly permitted me to publish the recipe.\r\n\r\nFor every 30 or 35 gallons of water take a bundle of wild merang (_Leucas\r\nzeylanica_ or (Kanarese) Thumba Soppu) plants about two feet in diameter,\r\nand, after removing the roots, boil it for about four or five hours, and\r\nlet it cool all night, and in the morning apply the decoction to the\r\ncoffee trees affected, with the aid of a garden syringe. The trees should\r\nbe well syringed, and it is advisable to give the tree a second\r\napplication. The refuse of the boiled plant should be scattered on the\r\nground around the stem of the tree.\r\n\r\nThis prescription might probably be useful in the case of garden plants or\r\nshrubs which have been attacked by insects.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[56] Mr. Reilly, of Hillgrove Estate, Coonoor, told me that he had first\r\nnoticed leaf disease about twenty-six years ago. It commenced low down on\r\nthe coffee on the Coonoor Ghaut, and then came gradually up the Ghaut.\r\n\r\n[57] A planter on the slopes of the Nilgiris gave me a well marked\r\ninstance of leaf disease being increased from want of digging, when there\r\nwas a good opportunity of contrasting the dug with the undug soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE SELECTION OF LAND FOR PLANTATIONS, AND THE VALUATION OF COFFEE\r\nPROPERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe selection of land for the planting of coffee requires great judgment,\r\nand the consideration of many circumstances besides the question as to\r\nwhether the land is or is not capable of growing good coffee. For, in\r\naddition to questions of the age of the forest land, climate, the\r\nsteepness of the gradients, aspect, and soil, we have to consider the\r\nhealthiness of the climate, the water supply, the facilities for procuring\r\nlabour, and the proximity of the land to good means of communication. Then\r\nas to the valuing of coffee plantations we have, of course, to consider\r\nall these points, as well as many others, to which I shall presently\r\nallude when I come to treat of that branch of my subject.\r\n\r\nIn Mysore, notwithstanding the enormous quantity of forest land stretching\r\nalong the Western Ghauts, there is, compared to the total area of forest,\r\nbut comparatively little land, suitable for coffee, to be cleared. In the\r\nsouthern part of the province there is none, that I am aware of, worthy of\r\nthe attention of Europeans, but one of the planters in the northern part\r\nof Mysore tells me that in that part of the country there is still much\r\nuncleared land, partly in the hands of the State, and partly the property\r\nof individuals. Such uncleared lands (and it is important when valuing a\r\nplantation to remember the following classification) may be divided into\r\nthree classes, (1) the original forest, or, as the natives call it,\r\nmother jungle, that has never been touched by man; (2) the forest of\r\nsecondary growth which has sprung up after the mother forest land has been\r\ncleared for grain growing, and abandoned after a crop or two has been\r\ntaken from the soil; and (3) land on which young forest is growing, and\r\nwhich has never previously had any other forest on it. These three classes\r\nof lands are easily recognized by experienced persons, and even at a\r\nconsiderable distance. In the first there are large numbers of trees of\r\ngreat size, and often of timber of good quality. In the second there are\r\nno large trees, or perhaps only one or two samples of the original\r\nforest--generally mangoe, as they are often used as worshipping\r\nplaces--towering from fifty to sixty feet above the present level of the\r\nforest. In the case of the third, or young forest: this class of land may\r\nreadily be recognized by the number of young Nundy and other deciduous\r\ntrees. The first-named class of forest is of course by far the most\r\nvaluable; the second will be more or less valuable according to the time\r\nthat has elapsed since the mother jungle was felled--in some cases this\r\nmay be only 40 or 50 years ago, in others from 50 to 100, and perhaps in\r\nsome instances upwards of 150 years ago. In the last case, of course, the\r\nland will approximate in value to the mother jungle, but in the first\r\nthere is an enormous difference in the value of the land, which will\r\neasily be understood when we consider what takes place when forest is\r\ncleared, burnt off and cropped. For in the tremendous conflagration that\r\nensues, much of the accumulated wealth of ages is destroyed; and I may\r\nremind the reader that an iron peg driven firmly down till its head was\r\nlevel with the ground of a newly-cleared piece of forest, was found to be\r\nprojecting no less than six inches from the surface after the fire was\r\nover. Then a crop is sown which indeed is not an exhaustive one, but it\r\nmust be remembered that the land is exposed to heavy tropical rains, and\r\nperhaps for two years, after which it is abandoned, and allowed to grow up\r\nagain into forest. So that the injury to the land from the burning of the\r\nforest, the removal of one or two crops of grain, and especially the loss\r\nfrom wash, bring about a state of exhaustion which a very long time is\r\nrequired to repair. The value of the land, then, in which this secondary\r\ngrowth of forest has sprung up, will entirely depend upon the time when\r\nthe forest was cleared and burnt off, and as this is more or less\r\nconjectural, it is difficult to give on paper any guide as to the probable\r\ntime, and the valuer can only form an opinion from the practice he has had\r\nin examining forest lands. As regards the third class, i.e., young\r\nforest on land that has never had any previous forest growth, the valuer\r\ncan have little doubt. Such lauds are not desirable, and are as inferior\r\nto lands of the second class as these generally are to those of the first,\r\nor mother jungles.\r\n\r\nI have said that a vast quantity of forest along the Western Ghauts is\r\nunsuitable for coffee; and it is so because of the excessive and\r\ncontinuous rainfall, and the estates, fortunately very few in number,\r\nwhich were started in the wet mountain regions which fringe the Mysore\r\ntableland, have all been abandoned. But on the eastern side of the passes\r\nthe rainfall gradually diminishes, and at a distance of about six or seven\r\nmiles from the crests of the Ghauts the coffee zone commences, and\r\nstretches inland to varying distances from the Ghauts till the forest\r\nregion gradually dies away into the wide-spreading plains of the interior\r\nof the province. Of the rainfall in this coffee region we have no reliable\r\naccounts, and it varies much even within short distances, but it is\r\ngenerally believed to range from 50 inches on the most easterly side of\r\nthe coffee districts[58] to about 120 on the west. Opinions vary much as\r\nto the most desirable site for plantations, but I think that most planters\r\nare inclined to think that a rainfall of about 70 inches is the most\r\ndesirable. As regards elevation above sea level, plantations vary from\r\n2,800 feet to upwards of 4,000, and it is generally supposed that the\r\nhighest elevations yield the best coffee, but it is very difficult to form\r\nany precise conclusion on the subject. Cannon's coffee, which is mostly\r\ngrown at about 4,000 feet, always fetched a high price, but this was\r\nowing, I believe, to its long-established good name, for, when I grew\r\ncoffee at elevations of from, I believe, 3,200 to nearly 3,500 feet, and\r\nof the same variety of plant, a large wholesale and retail dealer told me\r\nthat whether they bought my coffee, Cannon's, or Santawerry (an estate of\r\nthe best reputation) it was all the same. After looking over many lists of\r\nsales in recent years, I am struck with the small differences in the\r\nprices obtained for Mysore coffees, with the exception of Cannon's and a\r\nfew estates which still grow the old original plant of Mysore. But all the\r\nestates which grow the Coorg plant obtain prices very similar, though\r\nthere is a considerable difference in the elevation of the estates, and\r\ntherefore, so far as the price of the coffee is concerned, I should not,\r\nin valuing land for planting, attach much importance to mere elevation, as\r\nlong as it does not go below 2,000 to 3,000 feet, for below that we have\r\nno experience to go by, and are, therefore, unable to say what effect a\r\nlower elevation would have on the character of the coffee. We have now\r\nconsidered both climate and elevation, and the values of the various kinds\r\nof forest land, and have next to look at, and if possible value, the\r\neffects of aspect.\r\n\r\nThe more I have seen and studied coffee the more am I struck with the\r\nvalue of aspect, and this is of enormous importance in such a climate as\r\nMysore, which is liable to suffer so often from prolonged droughts, and as\r\nit is quite a common thing to have five months without a drop of rain, and\r\nalso during part of that time to have either dry winds or hot desiccating\r\nblasts of air coming in from the heated plains of the interior, it can\r\neasily be understood that in valuing lands, much consequence should be\r\nattached to forest which contains a large proportion of north and\r\nnorth-western aspects. As to the relative value of the various aspects I\r\nhave fully treated the subject in my remarks on shade, and I must leave it\r\nto the personal experience of planters to determine how much more value\r\nthey would attach to land mainly facing north and north-west as compared\r\nwith land facing mainly south and south-west. For myself I should\r\nconsider that the former was at least ten per cent. more valuable than the\r\nlatter; and that the relative value of the other aspects should be\r\ncarefully weighed before coming to an opinion as to the price that should\r\nbe given for forest land.\r\n\r\nIn the valuation of land the next thing we have to consider is the\r\nsteepness of the gradients on it. Now after having had much experience of\r\nsteep land, land on moderate slopes, and land which might almost be called\r\nflat, I have no hesitation in giving a decided preference to the\r\nmoderately sloping land. I object to the steep land, because it is\r\ntroublesome to work and manure, and because the ridges on it are sure to\r\nbe poor; and to the flat land, because the soil is apt to become sodden in\r\nour heavy monsoons, and because it is soon apt to harden, and thus is\r\ntroublesome to work. In my opinion, the highest value ought to be attached\r\nto the moderately sloping lands, less value to the flat, or nearly flat\r\nlands, and less still to steep lands.\r\n\r\nAs regards the kinds of soil suitable for coffee, there are points on\r\nwhich some difference of opinion exists. All however are, I think, agreed\r\nin thinking that the most desirable soils are those of dark chocolate\r\ncolour, considerable depth, and of easily workable character--what would\r\nbe described in England as a rather heavy loamy soil. Then, and sometimes\r\ntouching these soils, there are soils of decidedly whitish appearance,\r\nagainst which a general prejudice exists; but though some of these soils\r\nare light and of inferior character, others are capable of growing coffee\r\nquite as well as the best of the chocolate soils. Occasionally there are\r\nsmall sections to be found in good coffee lands of soil of a light\r\ncharacter and pinkish hue, which few people not familiar with it could\r\nsuppose to be a good soil, but in this I have found that coffee flourishes\r\nremarkably well. There are other classes of soil which are generally\r\nconsidered to be inferior to those above mentioned, lightish, bright rod\r\nsoils, black soils (though I have seen very good coffee in such), and\r\nsoils of a whitish and rather sandy character; but it may be laid down as\r\na general rule that all the soils we have, and I think I have soil of\r\nalmost every class, are capable of growing good coffee if the climate is\r\nsuitable, and if the forest in it is of undoubted primæval character; and\r\nI have much reason to think that, where soils have been found to be\r\nunfavourable, it is owing to the original jungle, say 50 or over 100 years\r\nago, having been felled, burnt off, and cropped with grain for a season,\r\nand then abandoned. In from thirty to forty years very fair forest can be\r\ngrown, but I should say that it would take at least 150 years to restore\r\nthe land to anything approaching its chemical and physical condition when\r\nthe primæval forest was first felled.\r\n\r\nWe have, lastly, to consider the healthiness of the climate, the water\r\nsupply, the facilities for procuring labour, and the proximity of the land\r\nto good roads.\r\n\r\nAs regards the climate of the coffee districts in Mysore, I have no\r\nevidence before me to show that there is much difference as regards health\r\nin any of the climates, though some, from elevation and nearness to the\r\nGhauts and the source of the sea-breezes, are decidedly more agreeable\r\nthan others which are lower, hotter, and more distant from the western\r\npasses. Manjarabad, however, is generally considered to be the healthiest\r\ndistrict, and some are of opinion that certain parts of the northern\r\ncoffee district are rather below the average as to healthiness. A good\r\nwater supply for drinking, and for pulping and nurseries, is, of course,\r\nof great importance, and a careful account should be taken of this in\r\nvaluing land for planting. Then the facilities as to the supply of labour\r\nrequire to be carefully taken into consideration. They vary very much, as,\r\nin some cases, the whole labour has to be imported, while in other cases\r\na considerable supply can be drawn from villages in the immediate\r\nproximity of the land. At one time it was always considered that it was a\r\ngreat advantage to have local labour, but the local labourers have now\r\nbecome so well off and independent that many planters much prefer the\r\nimported labourers, because the former are so uncertain in their\r\nattendance, while the latter, when once on the estates, have nothing to\r\ntake them away from their work till the season arrives for their departing\r\nto their homes, either below the Ghauts, or in the interior of the\r\nprovince, from both of which sources the planters of Mysore draw so much\r\nof their labour. But in the picking season there can be no doubt that the\r\nvicinity of villages is a great advantage, as this generally occurs before\r\nthe rice harvest, and before that takes place, many people are glad to\r\nwork for a month or two months on the plantations. So that, in valuing\r\nland, proximity to villages ought certainly to be taken into favourable\r\naccount. Finally, in valuing land, the proximity to good roads and easy\r\naccess to them is of great importance--and I say easy access to them\r\nbecause it sometimes happens that land is situated on the wrong side of an\r\nunbridged river which is sure to be in flood for many months of the year.\r\nI now turn to the important subject of valuing plantations of various\r\nages.\r\n\r\nI may commence here by observing that all the points enumerated as regards\r\nthe valuation of land suitable for coffee apply equally to plantations,\r\nbut it is hardly necessary to say that there are many additional points to\r\nbe considered when valuing a plantation that is for sale, or for which a\r\nvaluation may be required for any other purpose. The first point that a\r\nvaluator should inquire into, is the age of the forest land on which a\r\nplantation has been formed. This may not be very easily determined, as the\r\nwhole of the original forest may have been removed, but there are nearly\r\ncertain to be corners left, and the valuator should remember that the\r\nsurest sign of very old forest is an occasional very old and partly\r\ndecayed Nandi tree, or large and aged Marragudtha trees. The next point to\r\nbe considered is as to whether the forest was all felled at once and burnt\r\noff with a running fire, or whether it was cleared by degrees--i.e., in\r\nthe first year cleared of underwood and a few of the large trees, and the\r\nwood piled and burned in separate heaps, and the large trees gradually\r\nremoved in subsequent years. This may be regarded as a very important\r\npoint, for in the latter case the physical condition of the soil will be\r\nsure to have been better maintained, and, in the opinion of one of our\r\nmost experienced planters, the coffee will be much less liable to attacks\r\nof the Borer. The age of the plantation should next be inquired into, but\r\nmere age, it must be remembered, though it may be of great importance, is\r\nby no means always so. At first sight it would appear that a young\r\nplantation, with its virgin soil, must be more valuable than an old one,\r\nbut I have in my mind's eye a plantation in Manjarabad, belonging to\r\nfriends of mine, and the planting of which was begun as far back as 1857.\r\nLast year one of my friends took me over it, and a finer plantation it\r\nwould be impossible to find, and at the end of our walk he said to me,\r\n\"The place is better than you ever saw it.\" And so it most undoubtedly\r\nwas: and, as another planting friend once wrote to me, \"All the old\r\nestablished estates in Mysore are to the front still, and many of them\r\nbetter than they ever were,\" and better because manuring and cultivation\r\nhave improved pieces of inferior land and ridges to such a degree as to\r\nmake them superior to what they were before the land was first cleared and\r\nplanted. One of the estates in question was opened about ninety-five years\r\nago, and yet contains as fine coffee as one could wish to see. All depends\r\nupon the care with which the estate has been kept up, and into that the\r\nvaluator must specially inquire, and he must also specially inquire into\r\nthe age of the coffee trees, which, always supposing that the soil has\r\nbeen well kept up, is of far more importance than the mere age of the\r\nestate. My friends' estate, for instance, above alluded to, was an old\r\nestate, but it was, comparatively speaking, a fresh plantation, for all\r\nthe old trees had been removed, and the whole property replanted with the\r\nCoorg plant. So that, though the estate was old, the coffee was by no\r\nmeans so.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have hitherto said, it is evident that in many cases the\r\nvaluing of an estate presents to the mind an extremely complicated\r\nproblem, and there are so many exceptions and limitations, and so many\r\npoints of doubtful nature--the question of the age, for instance, at which\r\nthe coffee tree declines--that I cannot attempt to do more than indicate\r\nthose to which the valuator should turn his attention. There are, however,\r\npoints on which I can express a more decided opinion--the shade on an\r\nestate, its kind, or kinds, and regulation.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been previously written as to shade, its weight in\r\ndetermining the value of a plantation must obviously be very great; so\r\nmuch so, that planters, when going round an estate in Mysore, are\r\ngenerally more taken up with observing the shade than the coffee\r\nunderneath it. And I cannot, perhaps, better illustrate the effects of bad\r\ncaste trees than by mentioning what a neighbour said to me when I was\r\ngoing round his plantation. He pointed to the coffee under a bad caste\r\ntree and said, \"The coffee there gave a good crop this year, but the trees\r\nare suffering now, and will give a poor crop next year; while the coffee\r\nunder the good caste trees there gave a good crop this year, are looking\r\nwell now, and will give a good crop next year.\" Such, then, is the\r\ndifference, and sometimes it is much more, between bad and good caste\r\nshade trees. And when the reader remembers that Mr. Graham Anderson has\r\nsaid that he has experienced more misfortune of every kind owing to the\r\npresence of bad caste shade trees, it is evident that a valuator should\r\nattach a much higher value to a plantation shaded entirely with good caste\r\nshade trees than to one with bad or indifferent kinds of shade trees. For\r\nthe latter mean diminished crops, and more Borer and leaf disease, while\r\nthe former lead to the very opposite effects.\r\n\r\nManurial facilities have next to be taken into consideration, and here we\r\nshall find a very great difference between estates. Some, but I am afraid\r\nvery few, have spare, odd bits of jungle land which the proprietors have\r\nacquired for the purpose, or angles of the original forest which they have\r\nleft uncleared, from which valuable top soil may be procured, while others\r\nare in parts of the country where the grazing for cattle is good, and\r\nwhere cattle manure can sometimes be bought from the natives. But many\r\nestates have no top soil resources, and but poor facilities of making bulk\r\nmanure, and all these points require to be carefully considered when\r\nvaluing an estate.\r\n\r\nBut besides all the previously mentioned points, there are the labour\r\nfacilities, the water supply, and lastly, but by no means leastly, the\r\nconcentration of all the points of most importance in one central point to\r\nbe taken into consideration. It often happens on estates that the nursery\r\nis in one place, the pulping-house half a mile from that, and the bungalow\r\nhalf a mile from either. But is it not obvious that an estate is more\r\nvaluable when the bungalow, drying-ground, pulper, and nursery are all\r\nwithin a stone's throw of each other?\r\n\r\nLastly, we come to the most difficult question of all. How many years'\r\npurchase is a coffee property worth? To this question I can give no answer\r\nat all, nor is it likely that any answer can ever be given till all the\r\nfacts connected with the industry become widely known. And of all these\r\ndetermining facts, the execution of the projected railway line through the\r\nsouthern coffee district to Mangalore will certainly be the most\r\nimportant. This line, in fact (which will probably be opened in three\r\nyears' time), will alter the entire position of coffee, as it will not\r\nonly provide for the carriage of coffee to the coast and the importation\r\nof manure, but will bring the planters within ready touch of the finest\r\nsanatorium in the world--the Nilgiri Hills.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[58] My friend Mr. Graham Anderson presented to the Durbar, at the meeting\r\nof the Representative Assembly in 1892, an interesting memorandum on\r\nrainfall in Mysore, and the influence of trees on the condition of\r\nclimate, and in this he has given a return of the rainfall for a section\r\nof the Manjarabad Talook, stretching inland from the crest of the Ghauts\r\nto about the termination of the forest tract--a parallelogram of fifteen\r\nmiles in length from west to east, and about four miles from north to\r\nsouth. This section shows, from April to end of August, a rainfall of\r\n291.53 inches on the extreme west, as compared with 44.21 inches on the\r\nextreme east. But it is remarkable that this variation of no less than\r\n247.32 inches occurred on the northern side of the tract, the variation on\r\nthe southern side being only from 232.46 inches to 72.42 inches, or a\r\ndifference of only 160.04 inches. This shows an extraordinary, and at\r\npresent unaccountable, deflecting of the South-West Monsoon current. Mr.\r\nAnderson remarks that, though in heavy weather and with favourable winds,\r\nthe Monsoon rain is often carried to a considerable distance to the east\r\nof the termination of the forest tract, it is of common occurrence to find\r\nan almost total cessation of continuous rain a few miles beyond the forest\r\nzone.\r\n\r\nIn the memorandum in question Mr. Anderson also remarks on the well known\r\nand interesting fact that the clearing away of certain descriptions of\r\ntrees, and the substitution of others improves the supply of water in the\r\nsprings. But the whole memorandum is both interesting and practical, and\r\nits presentation at the meeting of the Representative Assembly is an\r\nadditional illustration of the value of that institution in pressing\r\nmatters of importance on the attention of the Government. The returns of\r\nthe rainfall were obtained from various planters on the section of country\r\ninvestigated by Mr. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE AN ESTATE PAY, AND THE ORDER OF THE WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first step towards making a plantation pay is to eliminate all sources\r\nof loss, and the first point claiming attention relates to the\r\nadvisability of abandoning all the spots on an estate which are difficult\r\nto keep up, sometimes from defects of soil, sometimes of aspect, and more\r\noften of both. At present you often find, just as you do in the case of\r\nfarmers in Scotland, that planters often make money on the good land to\r\nthrow much of it away on the bad, and the people who thus act simply do so\r\nfrom want of strength of mind; for everyone knows that it costs more to\r\nkeep up inferior coffee than it does to keep up the best, and that the\r\nlatter yields good and certain crops, while the former yields poor and\r\nuncertain crops. And it is equally well known that highly manured and well\r\nsituated coffee on good land can always be relied on to give a paying\r\ncrop, even in the very worst season, while coffee on poor land with a bad\r\naspect is simply at the mercy of the season. And one of the oldest\r\nplanters in Mysore told me that, some thirty years ago, when his land was,\r\ncomparatively speaking, unexhausted, if the blossom showers were\r\nfavourable he got a good crop all over the estate, but that if they were\r\nunfavourable, the best situated coffee on the best land still gave a fair\r\ncrop, while the rest of the plantation produced very little. The maximum\r\nof high and safe profits, then, will be obtained where the land kept up is\r\nall good, well situated, and well manured. There are, of course,\r\noccasional spots of half an acre or so in the very best lands which must\r\nby no means be abandoned. On the contrary, they should be kept up at any\r\ncost, as they would be the means of spreading weeds into the surrounding\r\nland, and the places that should be abandoned are continuous pieces or\r\nblocks on the outside of the coffee to be kept up. I may remind the reader\r\nhere that where an outside block can, as it were, be sliced off one side\r\nof the estate, an application can be made to the Government to have it\r\nmeasured and classed in future as land thrown out of cultivation, which is\r\nliable to a reduced rate of taxation, but the Government will make no\r\nreduction in the case of pieces of land, which are in the plantation,\r\nbeing thrown out of cultivation. I have said that the pieces of inferior\r\nland which may be occasionally found in the good coffee should certainly\r\nbe kept up; but there are, in the case of steep lands, sometimes pieces of\r\nland at the heads of slopes, and next to the fence, where, from\r\ninjudicious management, the soil has gradually worked down the hill, and\r\nin such cases a strip of the barest land near the head of the slope may\r\nwith advantage be thrown out of cultivation, and the abandoned land should\r\nbe thickly planted with trees, the leaves of which will be shed downwards\r\namongst the coffee. And in planting such abandoned strips with trees an\r\naddition will be made to the value of the estate, as wood, as elsewhere\r\npointed out, soon becomes scarce in any country that is taken up for\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nThe next source of loss which calls for observation is that arising from\r\nthe system of giving advances to labourers and to maistries--the name for\r\na class of men who take large sums to advance to coolies, and are paid a\r\ncommission on the number they bring in. The planters have lost large sums\r\nfrom this pernicious and troublesome system, and in the remarks previously\r\nmade on planters' grievances, the reader will find allusions to the\r\nexisting legislation on the subject, and the need for fresh legislation to\r\ngrapple with the evils arising out of giving advances for labour.\r\nSometimes the coolies die, and the money is lost altogether; sometimes,\r\nand not unfrequently, they abscond, and in the latter case it is such a\r\ndifficult matter to trace them that the planter simply resigns himself to\r\nthe loss of the money. Then as regards money advanced to maistries to\r\nbring coolies, somewhat similar difficulties occur. The maistry may die,\r\nhe may abscond, and sometimes he advances to coolies who decamp and take\r\nadvances from another planter or his maistry. In short, whether the\r\nplanter advances directly to coolies, or to maistries to bring coolies, he\r\nfinds himself involved in a mixture of losses and worries and uncertainty\r\nas to getting through his various works at the proper time.\r\n\r\nNow nearly every human system is calculated to serve some purpose, and\r\narises out of a greater or lesser degree of necessity. But it sometimes\r\nhappens that the original causes for the system have either disappeared or\r\nvery largely vanished, and that the system goes on by the force of\r\ncustom--very strong in all countries, and especially so in the East. And\r\nthus it is with the advance system. When labour was as low as 2 rupees 4\r\nannas a month (which was the rate I paid at first), it was quite\r\nimpossible that a man could, within any reasonable time, save enough money\r\nto pay the expenses of a marriage; thus borrowing became a necessity, and\r\nthe labourer therefore mortgaged his future labour, the sole security he\r\nhad to offer. The lender was, of course, always a man who wanted work\r\ndone, and by lending the required money obtained a certain command over\r\nthe labourer. In the early days of planting the local labourers were\r\nalways in debt to some native employer, and when they wanted to come to a\r\nEuropean plantation the owner of it had to pay off the sum owed by the\r\nlabourers, and when these labourers' sons wanted to marry it was customary\r\nto advance enough for the purpose, and sums of from 20 to 40 rupees a head\r\nwere thus advanced, and, in the end, many thousands of rupees were thus\r\nlent to the labourers, and led to the losses I have described. But in\r\nthese days, when labour has risen to 7 rupees a month, and the labourer\r\ncan live on about 2 rupees a month, he can save in a single year nearly\r\nenough for his marriage, and therefore the old necessity for his getting\r\ninto debt no longer exists, and some years ago I began to give up making\r\nadvances for marriages, and find that I am still well supplied with local\r\nlabour; and I feel sure that if other planters would only follow my\r\nexample, the advance system would gradually be reduced within small\r\nlimits, and thus one great source of loss on a plantation would be either\r\nabolished or reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nBut besides the advances made directly to local labourers by the planter,\r\nthere are the advances made by him to maistries to bring in coolies from a\r\ndistance. In former days the sums advanced were very small, and amounted\r\nto little more than a retaining fee of a few rupees a head. But from the\r\ncompetition for labour, or from planters weakly yielding to the demands\r\nmade on them, the sums so advanced gradually rose to as much as ten rupees\r\nahead, and, of course, the risks of the planter increased in proportion.\r\nNow this, of course, is a state of things very difficult to contend\r\nagainst, but I see no reason why some attempt might not be made to reduce\r\nthese advances to about one-half of their present amount; and I feel sure\r\nthat if the planters would only agree amongst themselves not to advance\r\nmore than five rupees a head, they would obtain as many coolies as they do\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nI may remark, finally, that the evils connected with this system, and the\r\ngreat temptation to fraud held out by it, certainly call for the\r\nlegislation which I have elsewhere alluded to when treating of planters'\r\ngrievances.\r\n\r\nThe losses arising from not closely supervising the people employed in\r\nminor works; from not having tools sharpened overnight; and from delay in\r\nsetting the people to work, I do not touch on here, as I have alluded to\r\nthem in my hints to managers: and the mention of tools reminds me that\r\nmuch loss is often incurred from their careless use, and from neglect in\r\nseeing after them, the result of which, of course, is that they are often\r\nlost or stolen. Then losses often occur from want of attention to the\r\norder in which the various works should be carried out, and which should\r\nbe influenced by the aspect and the kinds of soil on the plantation. Even\r\nif all the work of the plantation could be finished with ease and\r\ncertainty, it is important to observe the proper order, as to do so is\r\nmost beneficial to the coffee, and then it should be considered that,\r\nshould labour from some accident run short, it will at least be certain\r\nthat the most important parts of the plantation will have been attended\r\nto.\r\n\r\nRemoving moss or rough bark and cleaning the trees should be begun on all\r\nnorthern aspects. Then attend to the low-lying eastern aspects which have\r\nthe sun off them all the afternoon. Do next the north-western aspects,\r\nthen the southern, and lastly the due western and south-western aspects,\r\nwhich are so much exposed to the sun that the trees there have little moss\r\non them. The mossing party, it is hardly necessary to mention, should\r\nfollow the pruners.\r\n\r\nPruning should be begun in the most luxuriantly wooded part of the estate\r\nfirst, and the same order as to aspect should be followed as when removing\r\nmoss, as it is important to let light as soon as possible into the trees\r\nwhich are on the darkest aspect, and this order will, of course, suit the\r\nmossing party, which is, as I have said, always to follow the pruners.\r\n\r\nShade should be thinned in the same order as to aspect as that laid down\r\nfor the removal of moss, and as soon after crop as possible. The shade\r\ncutters should precede the pruners, as, after pruning, the coffee is of\r\ncourse more liable to be injured by falling branches.\r\n\r\nDig all the hottest aspects first, as the soil on these hardens soonest\r\nand more severely. Begin with the southern and south-western aspects, then\r\ndig the western aspects, then the eastern, and lastly the northern\r\naspects. When all the soil is of much the same degree of stiffness, this\r\norder should be followed, but the rule may require to be modified on some\r\nestates, where the soil may be of loose character on a southern slope, and\r\nof stiffer character on another aspect, in which case the stiff soil\r\naspect should be dug first.\r\n\r\nRemoving parasites should be done immediately after crop, and at the same\r\ntime as removing shade, or at any rate before pruning, as the branches\r\nwith the parasites on them would otherwise injure the coffee. It is\r\nimportant to remove these parasites before they seed, which is about the\r\nbeginning of the rains.\r\n\r\nYoung jack fruit removal should be begun about the last week in February.\r\nDo not remove the fruit when very small, as the tree will in that case at\r\nonce blossom again, and the work will then have to be repeated.\r\n\r\nFences should all be in order, and every gap filled up by the time the\r\nrice harvest is over, when the natives either never herd their cattle at\r\nall, or so carelessly that they are liable to be frequently in the\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\nAs regards weeding, wherever an estate is liable to rot, all the places\r\nthat are most liable to it should be weeded first, as it is very important\r\nto keep the ground quite clean, so that there may be a complete\r\ncirculation of air across it. Should it be found that any part of an\r\nestate is more liable to leaf disease than other parts, then the weeding\r\nshould be carried out first on the portion of the estate most liable to\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE MANAGEMENT OF ABSENTEE ESTATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs many of my readers are no doubt aware, elephants are employed to pile\r\ntimber in the Government yards, in other words, to arrange the logs one\r\nabove another, and at equal distances from each other. This they are soon\r\ntrained to carry out with mathematical accuracy, and all that the mahout\r\nrequires to do is to rest himself comfortably on some adjacent log and\r\nlook on, cheering the elephant with his presence, and perhaps throwing in\r\nan occasional remark. But sometimes the mahout goes to his dinner, or\r\nabsents himself for some other reason, and, before he leaves, addresses a\r\nfew parting injunctions to the elephant to continue his exertions. And at\r\nfirst the animal does so, but not for long does he proceed with his work\r\nat the same pace as he did when the mahout was present. He soon begins\r\nsensibly to relax. Presently, finding or imagining that there is no\r\nprospect of the mahout returning, he stops altogether, and stands for a\r\nmoment in doubt. Then all doubts seem to vanish, and finally he takes a\r\nbunch of foliage and begins to fan himself. Such is the nature of the\r\nelephant, and the human animal does not greatly differ from him.\r\nExceptional men there may be, and no doubt also exceptional elephants,\r\nbut, as the late Sir Charles Trevelyan good-naturedly said to an official\r\nin the Madras Presidency, \"The fact is, we all require a little looking\r\nafter.\" And hence it is that, when the proprietor cannot look after his\r\nown property, he finds it always advisable to give the manager an interest\r\nin the concern, or some interest which will induce the manager to fan\r\nhimself in moderation. In the case of tea plantations in India, sometimes\r\na share is sold to the manager, and then he is given time to pay for this\r\nout of the profits of the concern. In coffee, sometimes, a salary is\r\ngiven, and a bonus of one rupee a hundredweight on the coffee produced.\r\nThen on some estates belonging to a firm, as it was found that this worked\r\nunevenly, a bonus of a rupee a head was given on each coolie, which was\r\ndone to encourage managers to make their estate as attractive to coolies\r\nas possible. In one case I know of, the manager is allowed to invest\r\ncapital of his own in the concern to even as small an amount as 1,000\r\nrupees, and for the sum invested he receives a share in the profits of the\r\nestate. The 1,000 rupees are treated as part of the capital of the estate,\r\nand whatever the profits may be, the owner of the capital gets his share.\r\nIf he leaves, his capital is returned to him, or, in the event of death,\r\npaid to his heirs. Another plan, and I think the best, is to give a share\r\nof the profits in lieu of salary; or, should the manager not like the\r\nrisk, a salary enough for the manager to live on and a share of the\r\nprofits besides. But I do not think it wise ever to part with a share in\r\nthe ownership of the land, as, in the event of the death of a manager, who\r\nhas been turned into a working partner, a very unsatisfactory state of\r\nthings is liable to arise. And the original proprietor might, and probably\r\nwould, have trouble as to the management of the estate, as he would then\r\nhave to deal with the heirs of the deceased.\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly necessary to say that a proprietor should exercise great\r\ncare in the selection of a manager, but the circumstances of the estates\r\nin Mysore, which are always surrounded by a native population, and\r\nsometimes a very considerable population, are such that unusual care is\r\nrequired when appointing a manager. For in dealing with the people around\r\nhim, he requires to exercise much tact, and careful circumspection, and\r\ngreat control over his temper, which is often sorely tried. And he needs\r\nit all the more for the first few years, because anything new is sure to\r\nbe attacked and worried. When alluding to the fact that the new comer is\r\nexposed to many annoyances, while the old planter seldom is, a native\r\nofficial once said to me, \"The new man must submit to being worried and\r\nannoyed, and,\" he added with a laugh, \"even to be kicked for four years,\r\nand then he may do anything.\" Any planter, then, settling in a new\r\ndistrict requires to act with great care and tact till he passes the four\r\nyears period, when he may do anything in reason. But unless he has a full\r\ncontrol of himself, he will be sure to be involved in squabbles and\r\ndisputes of a more or less troublesome character, which are injurious to\r\nthe interests of the estate. And hence there is the greater need for the\r\nproprietor being careful in his selection of a manager.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that, at the outset, a clear understanding should be\r\ncome to between the absentee proprietor and his manager, so as to prevent\r\ndisputes and confusion. To avoid these it should be laid down either that\r\nthe manager is to have full power to act on his responsibility, or that he\r\nis to act entirely under the instructions of the proprietor. When the\r\nlatter understanding is come to, the manager must adhere strictly to the\r\norders of the proprietor, even though the agent may think that he would\r\nserve the proprietor's interests better by neglecting the orders, and\r\nbecause, obviously, the proprietor may have reasons for his orders which\r\nare not apparent, or only partially apparent, to the manager. In the event\r\nof a manager not being disposed to carry out orders to the letter, he\r\nshould at once resign his situation, as he has no right to receive his\r\npay on the understanding that he is to carry out his employer's wishes,\r\nand then fail to do so.\r\n\r\nPowers of attorney to managers should be carefully and fully drawn, as it\r\nis often of great importance that a manager should have full power to act\r\nin the courts as to buying and selling land, and other matters. If the\r\nfull power of acting on his own responsibility is to rest with the\r\nmanager, it should be distinctly so stated in the power of attorney. If\r\nthe power of direction lies with the principal solely, it should be\r\nremembered (a fact that is not always remembered, by the way, as I know\r\nfrom my own experience) that, though the manager has the power of acting\r\nfor the proprietor, he cannot do so in any degree at variance with the\r\ninstructions received. If, for instance, the proprietor orders that, in\r\nthe case of a dispute between him and another party, the manager is to\r\ncall in arbitrators to decide on certain points in a dispute, the manager\r\nwould have no right to put other points connected with the dispute to the\r\ndecision of the arbitrators, because he, the manager, might think it would\r\nbe of advantage to his principal to do so, or for any other reason\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of an absentee estate is necessarily entirely in the power\r\nof his manager; and whatever the number of accounts, reports, and returns\r\nmay be is of little consequence, as the proprietor cannot get behind them,\r\ni.e., he cannot count the coolies that enter the estate in the morning,\r\nand that being the case, he is wholly dependent on the honesty of the\r\nmanager. But the proprietor, it might be urged, can call for the\r\ncheck-roll of people. So he can, but there is nothing to prevent the\r\nmanager keeping two check-rolls, one to pay the people with and the other\r\nto send to the proprietor, and I have heard of this being done. Nor is\r\nthere anything to prevent a manager representing himself to be present on\r\nthe estate and attending to his duties, while in reality he may be\r\namusing himself fifty miles away. It is, if a little amusing, certainly\r\nvery instructive to read in \"Balfour's Cyclopædia\"[59] that \"coffee is\r\nliable to fail from leaf disease, Bug, Borer, and the absence of the eye\r\nof the owner,\" and the statement would have been quite complete had the\r\nwriter added that it is the absence of the eye of the owner which, in\r\nMysore at least, I may certainly say, is responsible for much of the leaf\r\ndisease and nearly all the Borer. But the reader will readily understand\r\nthat money is very easily frittered away in employing large bodies of\r\nlabourers unless an active personal interest is taken in seeing that full\r\nvalue is obtained from them, and that their efforts are rightly directed.\r\nIt is no wonder, then, that Dr. Balfour treats the absence of the eye of\r\nthe owner as an equivalent for the presence of Borer or leaf disease. I\r\nknow of two estates in Mysore, of about similar size, one of which gave a\r\nclear profit of over £5,000 one year, while a neighbouring estate as well\r\nsituated, and with better soil, yielded a small loss. Both estates were\r\nstarted in the same year. But in the case of the first, the eye of the\r\nowner was always present, while in the case of the second, the owner was\r\ntotally absent for many years, and afterwards only visited his property at\r\nlong intervals, sufficiently long to enable him NOT to estimate its steady\r\ndecadence.\r\n\r\nEvery estate should have an information book,[60] so complete that, in the\r\nevent of a new manager being appointed, he should hardly have to ask the\r\nproprietor a single question. The book should either be type written, or\r\nwritten in a hand as clear as type, should of course be paged, and have a\r\nwell drawn up table of contents, and a blank page opposite every written\r\npage, for the insertion of notes and observations. The book should give,\r\nfirstly, a history of the estate, then a list of the various fields, the\r\ndates on which they were planted, a description of the soil of each field,\r\nand an account of the manures put down in it, with notes on the results\r\nobserved from the various manures applied. A list should be given of the\r\nnative staff, and of the character and capabilities of the individuals\r\ncomprising it, their pay and length of service, and also of those amongst\r\nthe work people who would be likely to make good duffadars. The experience\r\nof the estate as to the order and way in which the various works should be\r\ndone should be carefully recorded. A section should be devoted to\r\nobservations made when visiting neighbouring estates, as it is of the\r\ngreatest importance to record all the local experience and opinions.\r\nRemarks should be made as to the best means of obtaining transport either\r\nfor the estate or carrying coffee to the coast, and as to how and where\r\nanything and everything the estate may require can be procured. The dates\r\nof feasts and holidays should be entered, and a section should be devoted\r\nto financing the estate, accounts and rates of pay, and the advances given\r\nby the estate to coolies, or maistries. Another section should be devoted\r\nto giving a complete inventory of all the tools, sawn timber, machines,\r\ncarts, cattle, bungalow furniture, in short, everything on the property.\r\nAnd a section should be devoted to lines, or coolie houses, and sanitary\r\nprecautions regarding them. Careful record should also be entered of all\r\nthe coffee sold, and the prices obtained for it, and remarks as to the\r\nchanges, if any, in the quality of the produce, as such changes would\r\nperhaps throw light on the treatment of the property, and the manurial\r\nsystem most advisable.\r\n\r\nThe dates on which vegetables should be put down, and the kinds most\r\nsuitable to the locality, and the best method of growing them should also\r\nbe noted, as well as the most suitable kinds of fruit, and the most\r\ndesirable kinds of ornamental trees. The rainfall register should also be\r\ngiven, as well as any other information of interest, as for instance, a\r\nlist of game shot from the estate.\r\n\r\nMuch of the above kind of information exists on estates, but it is either\r\nburied in diaries or accounts, and, in short, is not in a readily\r\navailable form. When preparing my own information books I was especially\r\nstruck with their value as books of reference, and found my first one of\r\nuse even before I had completed it. Notes soon accumulate, and in the\r\ncourse of about three or four years it will generally be found that a new\r\nedition is required. The book is especially valuable when you wish to hear\r\nthe opinions of any planter whose experience you would like to compare\r\nwith your own. In that case, instead of much talk ending perhaps in no\r\nvery clear result, you can ask that the information book should be glanced\r\nover and a note made opposite any point as to which the experience of the\r\nperson you wish to consult may differ from your own. I was particularly\r\nstruck with the advantage of my information book when an eminent\r\nagricultural chemist once paid a visit to my estate. I handed it to him\r\nand asked him to be kind enough to look over the section relating to\r\nmanures, and make any notes he thought fit on the conclusions arrived at.\r\nHe presently came to me with the book marked here and there with brief\r\nyes, no, or, perhaps, memo.'s. I then took my note-book, and in a very\r\nshort time wrote down his opinions as to the conclusions I had come to.\r\n\r\nAn absentee proprietor should have the information book written in\r\nduplicate and keep one copy with him, and in this he should write his\r\nopinion as to how it would be advisable to deal with the property in the\r\nevent of his death. The book, I need hardly add, would be of the greatest\r\nvalue to the proprietor's heir, as with it he would be the master of the\r\nmanager, while without it the manager would be the master of the new\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\nAnother great advantage arising from the information book is that it does\r\naway with all possibility of misunderstanding. There can be no \"Oh, I\r\nunderstood this, or thought you wanted the other,\" or, \"Oh, I was not\r\ninformed, and now that I know what you want.\" In short, there can be no\r\nroom either for disputes or excuses with a well-kept, written up to date,\r\ninformation book.\r\n\r\nThe following hints may prove useful to young planters, or managers, but,\r\nas it will be more convenient, I shall use the word manager solely, and\r\nthe reader will understand that in the term manager I include planters who\r\nare their own managers, or who, in other words, do not employ a manager.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Wellington was asked by Lord Mahon (afterwards the Earl\r\nStanhope) to what he attributed the success of his campaigns, the Duke\r\nreplied, \"The real reason why I succeeded in my own campaigns is because I\r\nwas always on the spot. I saw everything and did everything for myself.\"\r\nManagers should remember this secret of success, and remember that, when\r\nthey give orders they must always go and see that they are carried out,\r\nand if they do not do so, they may certainly rely on their orders being\r\nimperfectly, or inefficiently executed. And here I am reminded of a case\r\nto the point which happened one morning. My manager had ordered some top\r\nsoil to be laid on one of the roads in the plantation, and on this\r\nbonedust was scattered, the intention being that each basketful of top\r\nsoil should contain a certain proportion of the bonedust. On passing the\r\nspot on the way to look at some other work my manager dismounted, and\r\nsaid, \"if you will remain here for a moment I will rejoin you.\" Then he\r\nwent down into the coffee to look at the application of the manure. During\r\nhis absence I overheard a woman say to the man who was filling her\r\nbasket, \"You have put no bones in my basket.\" This called my attention to\r\nthe subject, and I then observed that the bonedust had not been scattered\r\nright up to the edges of the top soil, which overlapped the deposit of\r\nbonedust by about a foot, and hence her basket, which was being filled\r\nfrom the edge of the heap (which was a flattened one), contained no\r\nbonedust, or but a very little of it, and the result of this, of course,\r\nwould be injurious to all those trees which had been deprived of the\r\nproper share of bones, or got none at all. This may seem a trifling\r\nmatter, but it will illustrate and enforce my suggestion as to the\r\nnecessity of being always on the spot, and it is the attention to, or\r\nneglect of, all these apparently trifling matters which, in the total,\r\nmakes estate management either a success or the reverse. What I have said\r\nwill also illustrate the fact that coolies, who to those who do not\r\nunderstand them, appear so lifeless and uninteresting, do take an interest\r\nin what is going on, and this poor woman, as the reader will have\r\nobserved, was defending my interests, and remonstrating with the duffadar\r\n(native overseer) as to the way in which the manuring was being carried\r\nout, at least so far as her share in the work was concerned at the moment.\r\nI do not think I could add anything further as to the necessity of being\r\nalways on the spot, though I may as well mention that one planter of long\r\nexperience once said to me, \"Every day that a man is off his estate is a\r\nloss to him.\"\r\n\r\nManagers are apt to neglect seeing to the execution of the minor works of\r\nan estate, and it is there that there is often a great leakage of money,\r\nand, what is often of more importance, waste of labour which is required\r\nfor pushing forward other works. I will take, for instance, the people\r\nsent off to gather leaves for littering the cattle sheds. I have found by\r\npersonal inspection that, unless closely looked after, much of this labour\r\nwill be lost, and the same is sure to be the case with the people\r\nemployed in other minor works. To keep the people employed in minor works\r\nup to the mark the manager should always visit them daily, and, besides,\r\npay them a surprise visit three times a week.\r\n\r\nAnother source of leakage on an estate, and not an inconsiderable one,\r\narises from tools not being sharpened over night, or by some one before\r\nthe arrival of the people, and nothing is more common than to see a group\r\nof coolies hanging round the grindstone in the morning waiting to have\r\ntheir axes or knives sharpened. Ten minutes may here easily be lost, and\r\non six men this leads to the loss of one hour's work. Then time by a slow\r\nmanager is often lost in getting his gangs under weigh and setting them to\r\nwork. Where the work can be done by contract, or task work, this does not\r\nof course matter, but such work as pruning, shade tree thinning, etc.,\r\ncannot be tasked, and delay in setting to work is then a serious loss,\r\npartly in direct money, and partly from work delayed which it may be very\r\nimportant to push on.\r\n\r\nManagers should always carry note-books and take down at once anything\r\nthey may wish to remember. They should afterwards take out the principal\r\npoints, enter them on a slip of paper and put it on the writing table,\r\nfor, as the native saying goes, \"A good memory is not equal to bad ink\"\r\nfor recording a fact. Points or facts of more especial interest should be\r\nat once entered on the blank leaves of the information book to which I\r\nshall presently allude. When visiting other estates managers should always\r\nnote down any points of interest, and especially as regards manuring and\r\nthe effects of shade trees on the coffee.\r\n\r\nManagers, in the case of a large estate, should never walk along the\r\nroads, unless of course for a very short distance, but only amongst the\r\ncoolies at work, or when inspecting work done, or laying out fresh work.\r\nFor these purposes all the strength and freshness of the managers are\r\nrequired, and it seems superfluous to observe that a tired man is seldom a\r\ngood observer, or rather in a good state for observing. On a steep estate\r\nthe manager should dismount on the upper road and walk downhill to his\r\ncoolies, and send his horse down to the lower road so as to avoid climbing\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\nManagers should be careful of their health, make it a rule always to\r\nchange at once the moment they come in, and see that their food, however\r\nplain, is of good quality and well cooked. They should take remedies\r\nimmediately at the first indication of disorder, and should be very\r\ncareful to attend to the directions in the preceding section, and avoid\r\nall unnecessary fatigue, as it is when over fatigued that a man is most\r\nliable to the inroads of disease.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to, as soon as possible, make a beginning, however\r\nsmall, as regards any work, even if it should have to be discontinued for\r\na time on account of other works coming in the way. For the beginning\r\nstands there as a reminder that the work has to be done, and the\r\nproverbial first step has been taken.\r\n\r\nIt is also important so to arrange work that parties may be within easy\r\nreach of each other, as this of course lightens the work of supervision.\r\n\r\nWhen visiting a working party the manager should not trouble himself so\r\nmuch about the work being then done, but should occupy most of his time in\r\nexamining the work of the previous day, and he should see that the\r\nduffadars are not merely staring at the coolies as they work, but that\r\nthey are examining the work that has been done. When pruning, for\r\ninstance, the duffadar should move from one end of the line to the other\r\nexamining as he goes the trees just finished by the people. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that a fluent command of the vernacular is of the\r\nutmost, or I may say, of the most indispensable importance, for, as an old\r\nplanter once said to me, \"A native thinks that a European who can't speak\r\nthe language is a perfect fool.\" The reader will find a chapter in the\r\n\"Experiences of a Planter\" on learning languages by ear, and I regret that\r\nI cannot, from want of space, insert it in this volume.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[59] \"The Cyclopædia of India, and of Eastern and Southern Asia,\" by\r\nSurgeon-General Edward Balfour. Third edition. London: Bernard Quaritch,\r\n15, Piccadilly, 1885.\r\n\r\n[60] And so should every estate in England, and every business, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTER'S BUNGALOW, AND THE AMENITIES OF AN ESTATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best form of bungalow is, in my opinion, one with the rooms in a row\r\nand an open veranda ten feet wide running around three sides of the house.\r\nThe veranda at the back should also be ten feet, but there it would\r\nrequire to be partially inclosed, partly for bathrooms, and partly for a\r\nstore-room for household supplies. The advantage of this form of bungalow\r\nis that the wide veranda is a pleasant place to sit in, and walk up and\r\ndown in the rainy season, and besides, if an additional room is required,\r\na temporary partition may be put up, and should a permanent addition to\r\nthe accommodation be necessary, a portion of the veranda at the end of the\r\nbungalow may be built up. Such a form of bungalow, too, can easily be\r\nadded to in length.\r\n\r\nWillesden paper should be put under the tiles, as it prevents leaks, keeps\r\nthe wood of the roof largely free from the influence of damp, and the\r\nbungalow, too, in the monsoon months. For bedrooms I should recommend\r\nglazed tiles, and for the dining-rooms and verandas, unglazed square red\r\ntiles, fringed at the edges of the room with two or three rows of glazed\r\ntiles. I do not recommend the latter for any place where there are many\r\npeople moving about, as I have found that the glazing soon becomes\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nIt is generally the custom to have the kitchen at some little distance\r\nfrom the bungalow, but I do not think that this is a good arrangement,\r\npartly because it is inconvenient in the rainy season, and partly because\r\nthe kitchen is apt to be turned into a resort for horsekeepers and\r\nloungers. The plan I have adopted is to have the kitchen and the go downs\r\nin a wing running at right angles to the west end of the bungalow, and\r\nwith the kitchen door facing the back veranda. This arrangement is most\r\nconvenient for the servants, and enables the master of the house to have\r\nthe kitchen under easy observation, so as to see to its cleanliness, and\r\nprevent its being made a place of common resort. The dirt and disorder\r\nusual in an Indian cook room is well known, but there is no reason why it\r\nshould not be kept as neat and clean as an English kitchen. The floor\r\nshould be paved with square tiles, and I believe it would pay well, for\r\neconomy of fuel, and ready supply of hot water, to have a small Wilson\r\nrange (227, High Holborn--range No. 11 is a convenient size). Owing to the\r\nshape of the ground it may not be convenient to have the kitchen and go\r\ndowns built as a wing of the bungalow, and in that case they should be\r\nopposite the back of the bungalow, and connected with it by a covered way.\r\nNo drain should be made out of the kitchen or scullery. I have found it\r\ncheaper, and safer, from a sanitary point of view, to have all the dirty\r\nwater used for watering purposes. I have a group of orange trees on a\r\nslope near the kitchen, and above each tree a hole is made. Into this the\r\ndirty water is poured for several days. Then the pit is closed with earth,\r\nand others are used in succession. I thus get rid of a nuisance in a\r\nwholesome way, and at the same time water the orange trees.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the bungalow is of great importance. It should front due\r\nnorth, as the declination of the sun is southerly during the cloudless\r\nseason, and the sun is thus entirely off the front veranda, and if the\r\nsituation should not be naturally well sheltered from the east, a solid\r\nblock of casuarinas should at once be planted on the eastern side, as the\r\neasterly wind is disagreeable, and liable to create drafts, and\r\nconsequently cause chills. A line of casuarinas should be planted on the\r\nsouth and west side of the bungalow, and at such a distance as to cast a\r\nshadow on to the southern and western walls, and also on to the roof, as\r\nthis will keep the house much cooler than it would otherwise be. Other\r\ntrees might be suggested for this purpose, and trees affording more\r\ncoolness, but I have suggested the casuarina as it is a quick grower, very\r\nornamental, and not at all liable to be blown down. No carriage drive\r\nshould be made up to the front of the bungalow, as it is obviously much\r\npleasanter to look out of the veranda on to a pretty garden without a road\r\nintervening, and carriages should either drive up to the back of the\r\nbungalow, or to one end of it where a wide space may be left for turning.\r\nI have said that a line of casuarinas should be planted on the southern\r\nand western sides of the bungalow so as to shade it from the sun, and I\r\nwould suggest that, in order to keep the ground on these aspects cool,\r\norange trees should be thickly planted, and I may mention that I have done\r\nthis with excellent effect on the southern side of my bungalow. When\r\norange trees are planted for this purpose they should either not be\r\nallowed to bear fruit, or but a very small number of oranges, as the\r\nobject of course is to have, for ornamental reasons, fresh looking trees,\r\nand full of foliage, so as to keep the ground near the bungalow as cool as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe bungalows in Mysore are usually built on the grass land outside of the\r\nplantation, and where this is practicable it should always be done, as,\r\nfrom the value of the coffee land, much of it cannot be spared for\r\nplanting, whereas in the open, as the land is of little value the planter\r\ncan, by planting clumps of casuarinas and other trees, make his residence\r\nso much more agreeable and cheerful. But sometimes it is advisable or even\r\nnecessary to have the bungalow in the plantation, and in that case the\r\nmost must be made of the situation, and vistas cut here and there through\r\nthe shade trees so as to let in the best available views. It should be\r\nremembered, a fact too often forgotten, that, what are called in Scotland\r\nthe amenities, are not only agreeable in themselves, but have an important\r\nmarketable value, and when people discover that the winter on a Mysore\r\nplantation is one of the pleasantest climates in the world, and have\r\npractically realized the ease with which the journey may now be made, a\r\nplantation will be often regarded (as I regard mine) as a pleasant winter\r\nhome. And, whatever it may be regarded as, it is certain that an intending\r\npurchaser of coffee property on which he proposed to reside would\r\nnaturally, and perhaps unknown to himself, be influenced by the amenities\r\nof the estate.\r\n\r\nAs regards the garden in front of the bungalow, it should of course be\r\nlimited to such an amount as may be within easy command of the water\r\navailable. Roses should be freely used, and violets, mignonette,\r\ngeraniums, and phlox, while the edges of the veranda should have some\r\ncrotons and ferns in pots. I have given this limited list because it\r\ncontains all that is necessary to make a place reasonably presentable, but\r\nmany additions may of course be advantageously made.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that it is very desirable to place the bungalow as close\r\nas possible to the points where the near presence of the planter is\r\nadvantageous. These are the pulping-house, store, drying-ground, nursery,\r\nvegetable garden, and orchard. I have two estates where this desirable\r\ncombination exists, and by the exercise of a little care and time to study\r\nthe situation, it may often be carried out; but the best site for the\r\nbungalow cannot sometimes be discovered without a residence of some\r\nduration on the estate, and it is of great advantage in making a new\r\nplantation to defer for some time building a permanent bungalow. For all\r\npractical purposes a house with sun-dried brick walls, and a roof of rough\r\njungle wood, will answer very well for some years, and during that time a\r\ncareful study of the land will generally disclose a much better site than\r\none might at first be disposed to select. And I speak with personal\r\nexperience on this point, as, had I built a permanent house on the site I\r\nat first selected on my head estate, I should certainly have had cause for\r\nregret. At first sight it may seem that the proximity of the bungalow to\r\nthe drying-ground is not desirable, but the drying-ground, estate office,\r\nstore, and other buildings may, by planting, be completely and quickly\r\nscreened off from the dwelling-house. The permanent bungalow should be\r\nbuilt of brick, but all steps should be made of stone, and not of brick,\r\nas is so commonly done, as the stone is so much more suitable in a climate\r\nwhich is wet for so many months of the year. It is very advisable to keep\r\na bungalow cool at night, so that you may be able to have a cool house in\r\nthe day, and in order to effect this a free admission of air is necessary,\r\nand the doors of the dining-room certainly should have wire gauze doors as\r\nwell. The wooden doors may then be left open at night. The bedroom doors\r\nthat open into the verandas should have the same too, for, though this is\r\nnot quite so necessary, it is a great comfort to have plenty of air, and\r\nyet be able to exclude cats, rats, or snakes.\r\n\r\nBuilding materials should be constantly collected--stones, stone-posts,\r\nthe wood-work of native houses which is sometimes for sale; and a careful\r\neye should also be kept on all the felled wood left in the plantation, as\r\nthis is often overlooked till it partially decays, and it is very apt to\r\nbe stolen. Trees with a central dark wood, like Jack, may be left unsawn\r\nfor some years, but trees which have not, like Neeral or Mango, should be\r\nsawn up as soon as they are dry. Sawn wood should be brought home at once\r\nand stored in a house sheltered from the east wind which dries up the wood\r\nextremely, and a careful list should be kept of it. Wood for rafters is\r\nthe better for being put into a tank and left there for four or five\r\nmonths. I may explain that stone posts (we use the literal translation\r\nfrom the Kanarese) are blocks of from 8 to 12 feet in length, which are\r\nraised by fire by an ingenious process. The natives first light fires on\r\nthe slab of sheet rock they desire to operate on, and then cut small holes\r\nalong the segment they wish to split off. They then drive wedges into the\r\nside of the rock, and the segment splits off, giving a stone post of the\r\nlength required (they may be raised as long as 20 feet) and about 18\r\ninches wide and 5 inches thick. There are no more useful things to have a\r\nsupply of on an estate, and we use short ones for the posts of wire fences\r\nand for stiles. They are particularly useful for supporting verandas.\r\n\r\nTo prevent white ants attacking the roofs of buildings I have successfully\r\nused the following mixture. Tar, one pailful; asphalte, 2 lbs.; and castor\r\noil, one seer. Mix and boil these ingredients. Afterwards add sand. Then\r\nplaster the mixture on the top of the walls to the depth of about two\r\ninches, and on this place the wall plates. This plan was adopted when one\r\nof my bungalows was re-roofed many years ago, and we have not a sign of\r\nwhite ants, though they are numerous all around the house.\r\n\r\nIf posts, when put in the ground, are buried in sand, and surrounded with\r\nit up to the level of the floor, white ants will not attack the wood, as\r\nthey cannot apparently work in sand. This is important to remember, as\r\nwooden posts are often used for cattle, and other sheds.\r\n\r\nToddy trees past yielding toddy should be cut down, split into convenient\r\nsizes for reapers and other purposes, and should then be smoked to\r\npreserve the wood. As I previously pointed out, the toddy tree (_Caryota\r\nUrens_ palm) is a most useful tree, and the seeds of it should be freely\r\nsown in the fences, waste jungle, and the bottoms of deep ravines, but it\r\nis not a desirable tree to have in the plantation.\r\n\r\nWood for handles should be kept in store, as it is of great importance to\r\nuse well seasoned wood. Jack roots are valuable for all short handles.\r\n\r\nLines, or rows of houses for labourers should be made of sun-dried bricks,\r\nand roofed with corrugated iron. For sanitary reasons they should, if\r\npossible, be divided over several sites. The manager should occasionally\r\nvisit the lines, and a duffadar be appointed to see after them, and that\r\nno dirty water is thrown down in front of the doors. The houses should be\r\nnumbered, and a list of the occupants kept. New arrivals should be at once\r\nreported, as bad characters are often harboured in the lines. A pensioned\r\nsepoy might be advantageously employed to look after the lines, and report\r\non new arrivals, and also keep an eye on persons who may be suspected of\r\nstealing coffee. The advantage of employing a stranger for such purposes\r\nis obvious, as natives residing permanently in the locality are much\r\nafraid of making enemies, whereas a fresh pensioned sepoy might be got in\r\nfrom time to time, and he should be changed before he had time to make any\r\nfriends on the estate. An application for a sepoy should be made to the\r\nofficer in charge of pensioned sepoys in Bangalore. These pensioned sepoys\r\nmight also be employed with advantage in the crop season, with the special\r\nobject of preventing coffee robbery from the plantations, which are often\r\nsurrounded with villages.\r\n\r\nAs regards coolie lines, it is important to consider aspect, and a slight\r\nslope towards the east, or slightly south, is a good one, as it catches\r\nthe first rays of the sun, and so reminds the people of their duties in\r\ncoming early to work, and enables them to warm themselves when the\r\nmornings are chilly. Such an aspect is also sheltered from the south-west\r\nmonsoon blasts, and, in the hot weather, from the heat of the westering\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at a magnificent row of Casuarinas (_Casuarina Equisetifolia_,\r\nthe Tinian pine or Beefwood) which I planted on my property about the year\r\n1859, and which are now about 150 feet high, and consider the value of\r\nthis tree, both for timber and firewood, I stand astounded at my own\r\nstupidity in not having planted them on a considerable scale. But it is\r\nthus in all new countries where you are surrounded by trees, and it is\r\ndifficult to believe that, under such circumstances, timber and wood can\r\never become dear and scarce, and the Englishman rarely plants trees for\r\ntimber or fuel,--in fact, I am the only one who has done so as far as I am\r\naware--and perhaps they do not realize, being born in a land of slow\r\ntimber growth, how rapidly some trees shoot up in Mysore. It may encourage\r\nplanting if I mention that I took careful measurement by line of one of\r\nthe row alluded to. In January, 1882, the height of the tree was 153 feet,\r\nin girth near the ground, 5 feet 8 inches; at 50 feet, 3 feet 8 inches;\r\nand 1 foot 6 inches at 100 feet. In February, 1884, the same tree was in\r\ngirth at 4 feet from the ground, 5 feet 3 inches; at 50 feet, 4 feet 5\r\ninches; and at 100 feet, 2 feet 3 inches. In March, 1886, this tree, at 6\r\nfeet from the ground, was 5 feet 4 inches in girth; at 77 feet, 3 feet 2\r\ninches; and at 100 feet, 2 feet 3 inches. This tree was again measured in\r\nFebruary, 1893, when its dimensions were found to be as follows. Height,\r\n154 feet. Girth at 3 feet from ground, 6 feet 3 inches; at 6 feet, 5 feet\r\n10 inches; at 77 feet from ground, 2 feet 9 inches; and at about 20 feet\r\nfrom the top of the tree, 1 foot 2 inches.\r\n\r\nThe wood is very strong, and may be used for rafters. It makes excellent\r\nfuel, giving much heat, and little ash.\r\n\r\nThe _Grevillea Robusta_--Silver Oak--should also be planted, as it affords\r\nexcellent firewood.\r\n\r\nAnd _Poinciana Regia_--the gold Mohur, which is also good for making\r\nCharcoal. _Pithecolobium saman_, the rain tree, should also be planted, as\r\nI find that (Report of Government Gardens, Bangalore, for 1888-89) \"In\r\ngood open soil it grows more rapidly than any introduced trees.\" I have an\r\n_Eucalyptus Globulus_ (the blue gum) growing fairly well on my property,\r\nand about eight or nine years old, but, as it is unfavourably reported on\r\nfor Mysore in the Report previously mentioned, I do not recommend it.\r\n\r\nCasuarinas should be planted in holes four feet deep, and certainly not\r\nless than that depth if a safe and rapid growth is desired. I have been\r\nparticularly struck with the great difference in the rapidity of growth\r\nwhere the holes have not been deeply dug. The plants will require a little\r\nwater during the dry weather of the first year.\r\n\r\nAs the most important part of a planter's capital is his health, it is\r\nobvious that great pains should be taken to conserve it, for, though\r\nMysore will be found to be a very healthy country if ordinary precautions\r\nare taken, the extremes of temperature are very great--often cold in the\r\nmorning--very hot in the sun in the middle of the day, and often turning\r\nsuddenly cold again at sunset. In England the lowest Mysore temperature\r\nwould not be called cold, but relatively to the heat of the day it is so.\r\nThen the east winds, if you get heated to the extent of perspiration, are\r\napt to produce that chill which is the starting point of illness in most\r\ncountries. For a great many years past I have, as a matter of curiosity,\r\nwhich has since become a matter of habit, always asked when told of the\r\ndeath of anyone, \"Did he not get a chill?\" And I have almost invariably\r\nfound the answer to be in the affirmative. When, then, a planter comes\r\nin, he should make it a rule always to change his things from head to\r\nfoot, and he should avoid sitting in drafts when the wind is from the\r\neast. When he goes out shooting he should take a spare flannel shirt with\r\nhim, change his shirt when suitable opportunities occur, and, of course,\r\ndry the one he has taken off in the sun. He should always take a cover\r\ncoat with him to put on, when, after a hot day in the sun, he may have to\r\nride home in the chilled evening air. As a protection against the sun\r\nthere is nothing better than a coat padded with cotton all down the back\r\nand front, and with a stand up padded collar. Some people prefer large\r\nsolar topees. I dislike them, as they heat and oppress the head, and\r\nalways prefer a light topee and an umbrella. It is well known that the\r\nhead is affected more through the eyes than in any other way, and smoked\r\nglasses should always be used when going along unshaded roads, and\r\nespecially across dried grass lands. Over fatigue should be avoided as\r\nmuch as possible, and the effects of it done away with immediately. When\r\ntired do not call for brandy or whisky and soda-water, but if you feel\r\nthat you require anything to keep up the system, a plateful of soup, made\r\nwith one of Brand's beef preparations, will be found to be far preferable.\r\nThen a bath, and an hour in bed will turn you out a fresh man fit for\r\nanything, mentally or bodily, and you will be able to eat a good meal with\r\nappetite and advantage. The best kind of clothing is light tweeds, such as\r\nmight be used in England in warm summer weather. Cholera belts, or\r\ncummerbunds, are often recommended, but I much prefer thick, short flannel\r\ndrawers coming rather high up over the middle of the body. You thus admit\r\nfree ventilation, and at the same time avoid risk of chill about the\r\nloins.\r\n\r\nNext to protecting the body from without, or perhaps of equal importance,\r\nis fortifying it from within. Here the first point of importance is to\r\nget a good cook who is a good baker, and supply him with American flour.\r\nToddy from the sago-palm is an excellent substitute for yeast, and I\r\nimagine it must be better, for I never get better, and very seldom as\r\ngood, bread anywhere in the world as I do in my Indian home in the jungle.\r\nThe flour usually to be bought in India, made from wheat grown in the\r\ncountry, is either bad or adulterated, and often has sand in it, and the\r\nbread made from it is of poor quality. As regards food, there is no\r\ndifficulty in Mysore, and at a moderate cost as good a table can be kept\r\nas could be desired for purposes of health and comfort. Attention should,\r\nof course, be paid to having a good vegetable garden, in which a good\r\nsupply of lettuces and tomatoes should form a principal feature, and\r\nduring the wet weather months, when vegetables cannot be procured on the\r\nspot, tinned vegetables should be used. I have found the French tinned\r\nvegetables to be the best. There are now many excellent preparations of\r\nherrings preserved in tins, and these should be used occasionally. Ghee is\r\ncommonly used in India for cooking, but for all dishes for which it is\r\nsuitable, oil is much cheaper and better. Gingelly oil (_Sesamum\r\nOrientale_) is the best, or, I think, the only oil which is good for this\r\npurpose. It is, I find, by the article on oils in the \"Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica,\" the finest culinary oil in the world, and superior to olive\r\noil, for which, indeed, it is commonly sold, and large quantities of the\r\nseed go to Southern Europe. The seed should be procured and washed in cold\r\nwater to remove the red epidermis, and then a native oil-maker may be got\r\nin to prepare the oil. When ghee, or clarified butter, is required, never\r\nbuy that article in the bazaar, but buy the best native butter and have it\r\nmade into ghee. Boil the butter, and add to it a small quantity of sugar\r\nand salt, and skim off floatage. If to the clarified butter some fresh\r\nmilk is added, it may be used for the table instead of butter, but it is\r\nbetter, I find now, to use tinned butter.\r\n\r\nCleanliness in the kitchen, and vessels in good order, are points easily\r\ntalked about, but cannot be attained without some inspection, and the\r\nkitchen and its utensils should be examined from time to time. People who\r\nare particular have all the pots and pans ranged out ready for inspection\r\ndaily, and such inspections are most necessary for health, as the dirty\r\nhabits of the native servants are such that persistent vigilance is\r\nrequisite. And I may here add that there is no use in telling the servants\r\na thing once--they must be told again, again, and again. At last they give\r\nin to your persistence, and being, like most people in the world, a good\r\ndeal creatures of habit, go on fairly well. It is only fair to the native\r\nservants to mention that, if they do keep things in a dirty state, it is\r\noften because they have not the means that servants have at home. The\r\nwater supply at their command is commonly very deficient, and often not\r\nover clean, and they are generally ill supplied with places to wash up in,\r\nand with dusters and glass cloths, and then they are rated, and often\r\nabused, because plates are badly washed and things in general dirty.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of health requisites, I, of course, include literature.\r\nThis, for a planter of moderate means, is generally a matter of great\r\ndifficulty, and must continue to be so till the railway system is extended\r\nto the planting districts. At present novels that cannot be read more than\r\nonce are quite out of the question on the score of cost, and, under the\r\ncircumstances, the planter should content himself with buying Scott's and\r\nBulwer's and George Eliot's novels. He should, of course, have a good\r\nAtlas, an Encyclopædia--Chambers' is good and moderate in price, and\r\nBalfour's \"Cyclopædia of India,\" which contains much valuable and\r\ninteresting information. He might also buy Lecky's Works, and Sir John\r\nStrachey's \"India,\" and Buckle's \"History of Civilization,\" for, whatever\r\nthe faults of the last may be, the writer's style is admirable, and the\r\nbook stirs up thought and inquiry in the mind. Addison's \"Spectator,\" as\r\nit is commonly called, Amiel's \"Journal,\" and Locke's \"Conduct of the\r\nUnderstanding,\" might also be bought. Ville's \"Artificial Manures\" should\r\nbe procured and studied. Then for newspapers, I may certainly recommend\r\n\"The Spectator,\" \"The Mail,\" or tri-weekly edition of the \"Times,\" and\r\n\"The Illustrated London News\"--not the thin paper edition of it, which is\r\nmost unsatisfactory in every way. One of the best, if not the very best of\r\nIndian papers is the \"Madras Mail,\" and that should certainly be taken,\r\nmore especially as there is much planting intelligence in it. A note\r\nshould be kept of the various books reviewed in \"The Spectator,\" and of\r\nany books the reader might fancy to buy, and Smith's lists of second-hand\r\nbooks, and also the lists of Messrs. Mudie and Co., should be procured,\r\nand from these booksellers books may often be bought at a very moderate\r\nprice. Do not buy cheap editions of novels, but buy the original three\r\nvolume editions, which have good paper and print, and which may be bought\r\nsecond-hand at most moderate prices.\r\n\r\nIt is of great importance that a planter should have some pursuit which\r\nmay be both useful and interesting, such as botany, natural history, or\r\ngeology, and drawing, too, would be most valuable. In the old days sport\r\nfilled up our leisure hours, but that, in these days, is not always to be\r\nhad without going far afield, as, from the number of guns in the hands of\r\nthe natives, the game within their reach has been mostly destroyed. It is\r\nof great value, then, to have some pursuit to fill up time when there is\r\nnot enough of it to spare to go to a distance from home for sport.\r\nAttending to, and taking an interest in a garden is a great resource, and\r\nindirectly a source of great pleasure, which I am reminded of as I write\r\nthese lines, and at the same time listen to the warbling of the Bulbuls in\r\nthe flower garden in front of my bungalow. These charming little birds are\r\nvery active, and are now (February 28th), collecting materials for\r\nbuilding their nests. There are, too, many charming warblers which are\r\nattracted by a garden so arranged as to attract birds. The beds in the\r\nforeground should consist of a mixture of flowers and standard roses, and\r\nthose at the back of various flowering shrubs, and low trees which are\r\nsuitable for the birds to nest in. I have no carriage road in front of the\r\nbungalow, and with this arrangement can have the beds quite close to the\r\nfoot of the steps of the inclosed veranda. I am much struck with the\r\npersistent loquacity of these Indian birds, and at no time of day--not\r\neven for a minute--is the sound of birds absent, and their notes are to be\r\nheard all through the fine weather.\r\n\r\nIt is very advisable to take up waste paddy fields, i.e., abandoned rice\r\nterraces, for cattle grazing, and I may point out that this is also of\r\nadvantage to the amenities of an estate, by providing snipe shooting close\r\nat hand. It will also be found of advantage for feeding ducks and geese. I\r\nhave a stretch of such land on one of my properties, and find it most\r\nuseful. The water, I may add, should be carefully conducted to the various\r\nterraces, just as if they were to be cultivated with rice, this, as I need\r\nhardly say, being necessary for the snipe. Amongst these scraps of hints,\r\nwhich may be useful, I may mention the fact that tealeries were once\r\ncommon in India. I am told that they are easily established, though I\r\nhave, myself, no experience of them. It is sometimes possible to add to\r\nthe amenities of an estate by reserving pieces of land for tigers to lie\r\nup in, and this is very important, now that every scrap of land is being\r\ntaken up for planting either coffee or cardamoms, and that cover for game\r\nis becoming proportionately scarce. There are two such pieces that I have\r\nreserved on my estate for tigers, but care must be taken beforehand to see\r\nthat such reserves are on the exact route by which tigers cross from one\r\npart of the country to another. For instance, the pieces I have reserved\r\nare about three miles apart, and I have never known or heard of a tiger\r\nbeing between them excepting on one occasion last year, when a royal tiger\r\ninspected a cattle shed of mine about five minutes' walk from the house.\r\nAt first sight it seems singular that these animals, like hares, should\r\nhave their runs, and still more that the runs should be so regularly\r\nadhered to, though they may be several miles apart.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter, and my remarks on planting, I have only to\r\nobserve that, if a planter chooses to take an interest in everything that\r\nis going on around him, and learns to make himself at home in the country,\r\nhe will find the life both interesting and agreeable. In former times\r\nthere was, no doubt, a sense of remoteness in the situation, but that, as\r\nwe have seen, has been considerably removed by the railway extensions of\r\nrecent years; and when the proposed lines, to which I have alluded in my\r\nintroductory chapter, are carried out, planters, during the unimportant\r\nseasons of the year, may reside either at Bangalore or on the Nilgiri\r\nhills (the climate of the latter, taking it all the year round, is the\r\nfinest in the world), and yet be in full touch with their affairs.\r\n\r\nFinally, I may observe that in Mysore we have the great advantage of being\r\nout of reach of the faddists of the House of Commons, who, for the sake of\r\ntheir votes, have to be humoured, whether the interests of India suffer or\r\nnot. There is no chance, for instance, of the opium faddists thrusting a\r\nCommission on the Mysoreans, and then making them pay for part of the\r\nexpenses of the inquiry. The progress of India may be checked by the\r\nignorant or unprincipled action of a party in the House of Commons (and\r\ncertainly will be checked if the opium faddists are allowed to have their\r\nway), but Mysore is free from the only danger that threatens India--the\r\nsacrifice of its interests in order to serve party ends in the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN SILVER QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the preceding chapters were written a great and most momentous step\r\nhas been taken by the Indian Government. On the 26th of June, 1893, the\r\nFinance Minister in India announced that a gold standard was to be\r\nestablished, and that the mints were to be closed to the free coinage of\r\nsilver. This measure, which so profoundly affects the prospects of the\r\nproducers and manufacturers of India, I am compelled to notice. To do so,\r\nhowever, in an exhaustive manner would be quite beyond the scope of this\r\nbook, and I shall confine my remarks as much as possible to the points of\r\nthe subject which bear upon the welfare of those who produce or\r\nmanufacture anything in India. The reports[61] and papers enumerated at\r\nthe foot of the page supply me with a large amount of information and\r\nopinion, but I must warn those interested in the subject that a complete\r\nview of the whole situation, as far as India is concerned, cannot be\r\nobtained from them. For some, and in my opinion the most important, points\r\nconnected with the question, have either not been alluded to at all, or\r\nquite inadequately investigated. These defects I hope in some degree to\r\nbe able to supply from my long experience of the effects of the\r\nexpenditure of capital in developing the resources of India--and I say in\r\nsome degree, because I feel sure that a much fuller investigation is\r\nrequired before all the far-reaching effects of this momentous measure can\r\nbe adequately weighed. I trust, however, that, even in the short space I\r\nam devoting to the subject, I shall be able sufficiently to elucidate\r\nthose points which dominate the situation, and a consideration of which\r\nwill show that if the Government succeeds in forcing up the gold value of\r\nthe rupee in the manner proposed, the prosperity of the people, the\r\npopularity of our rule, and the state of our trade in the East will be\r\nmost seriously prejudiced. And now let me begin at the beginning, so that\r\nthe uninformed reader may have a clear view of the whole subject as far as\r\nIndia is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the movement in India with reference to the introduction of\r\na gold standard and forcing up the gold value of the rupee is shortly, and\r\nI believe very accurately, stated by Sir Frank Forbes Adam in his evidence\r\ngiven before the Currency Committee; and on November 26th, 1892, he told\r\nthe Committee that \"Though there is undoubtedly dissatisfaction existing\r\namong a certain number of those carrying on foreign trade, really the\r\norigin of the movement and its true force proceed from the servants of\r\nGovernment.\" Of this, I think, there can be no doubt whatever; and it is\r\nimportant to remember that this movement did not originate with the\r\npeople, or planters, or merchants, or manufacturers, or from any section\r\nof the producers and traders of India. The servants of the Government had\r\na great and legitimate grievance, because they found that, though rupee\r\nprices in India were not to be complained of, they experienced a grievous\r\nloss on their home remittances, and it was their persistent agitation\r\nwhich created and maintained the true force of the movement. The\r\nagitation they thus originated was joined in by some of the merchants of\r\nIndia, though to what extent does not appear, and I can only say generally\r\nthat the merchants who did join the movement were small in number. Bombay\r\nand Karachi were clearly against any interference with the currency; and\r\nfrom the expression of disappointment which fell from the Hon. Mr.\r\nMackay--President of the Currency Association, Calcutta--with reference to\r\nthe small number of his supporters, I am led to the conclusion that, with\r\nthe exception of a certain proportion of Calcutta merchants, occasional\r\nindividuals in other parts of India, and the servants of the State, all\r\nIndia was, and is, dead against the monetary policy of the Government. Of\r\nthe twenty-two witnesses examined before the Currency Committee, thirteen\r\nwere against the Government measure, six in favour of it (four of the\r\nlatter being Government servants), two doubtful, and one presumably\r\nagainst the measure.\r\n\r\nThe main features of the measure I take from the statement of the Finance\r\nMinister, who, on the 26th of June, 1893, announced the introduction of a\r\nBill \"with the object of altering the Indian monetary standard from silver\r\nto gold,\" and who in his next sentence declared that \"It is not intended\r\nto do more at present than stop the free coinage of silver at the Indian\r\nmints, and as a provisional arrangement to provide for the issue of rupees\r\nat these mints in exchange for gold at the ratio of 1s. 4d. per\r\nrupee.\"[62] In a subsequent part of his speech Sir David Barbour states\r\n\"that an arrangement for the receipt of gold at the mints at a ratio of\r\n1s. 4d. per rupee will be made by executive order, and so will the\r\narrangements for the receipt of sovereigns in payment of sums due to\r\nGovernment at the rate of fifteen rupees a sovereign.\" The current rate\r\nof exchange then, and still existing, is about 1s. 3d., and the\r\nGovernment thus proposed, by creating an artificial scarcity of rupees, to\r\nforce up the gold value of the rupee by one rupee per sovereign. Let us\r\nnow glance at the cash effects of the measure on the finances of the\r\nGovernment and the prosperity of the people; and in doing so I shall, to\r\naid the comprehension of the English reader who knows nothing of lakhs, or\r\ncrores, or Rs. x, state the figure in pounds sterling, treating the rupee\r\nat its old value of 2s. To do this will not materially affect my\r\nstatements, for, though some articles have risen in price, others have\r\nfallen, and, on the average, the rupee (excepting as regards labourers'\r\nwages, which have much risen in many parts of India in recent years) goes\r\nnearly as far in India as it ever did, a fact which is fully corroborated\r\nby several very competent witnesses examined by the Currency Committee,\r\nthough one witness maintained that silver prices in India had risen.[63]\r\nIt may be interesting to note in this connection that the purchasing price\r\nof silver in China has remained unchanged for many years past, and that\r\nfor the last thirty years there has been little change in the purchasing\r\npower of the rupee in Ceylon. Both these statements I make on the\r\nauthority of witnesses examined before the Currency Committee.\r\n\r\nWhat then would be the cash effect (1) on the finances, and (2) on the\r\npeople, were the Government successful in forcing up the gold value of the\r\nrupee by one rupee a sovereign? The saving that the Government would\r\neffect in remitting money to England to pay home charges would amount to\r\nabout £1,570,000,[64] but as the amount is liable to loss by exchange we\r\nmust make a deduction, and, in round numbers, the sum that the Government\r\nwould save is about a million and a half sterling. Now as to the people of\r\nIndia. What the Government gains, i.e., a rupee a sovereign, the seller\r\nof produce must lose, as exporters could afford to give them just so much\r\nless than they now do. Now, taking the exports of India at one hundred\r\nmillions,[65] the currency measure of the Government would cause a loss to\r\nproducers of 7 per cent., which is equivalent to a tax on the exported\r\nproductions of India of seven millions. The result of course is, that to\r\nget little more than one million and a half into the Treasury, the\r\nGovernment proposes to take seven millions out of the pockets of the\r\npeople. Now I have no wish to pose as what is commonly called an expert,\r\nand I naturally shrink from any idea of criticising that long chain of\r\nfinancial luminaries which, beginning at the Council Chamber at Calcutta,\r\nstretches through the rooms of the Currency Committee which recently sat\r\nin London, right up to that Cabinet over which the greatest of financial\r\nluminaries presides, but I trust I may be allowed to go as far as to say\r\nthat the arrangement made by Mr. Gladstone's Government which is the body\r\nultimately responsible--does not seem to be of a very alluring character,\r\nas it entails on India, viewed as a whole, a loss of £5,500,000. And this\r\ncheering result has apparently been viewed with such satisfaction by the\r\nfinancial experts, that it is to be regarded as merely a small instalment\r\nof the blessings they have in store for the happy toilers whose destinies\r\nthey have been empowered to influence. For if the policy of taking five\r\nand a half millions sterling out of the pockets of the people in order to\r\nput about one million and a half into the financial till is a good one,\r\nthe extension of the process, up to certain limits, must be equally so.\r\nFor such an extension the Indian Finance Minister is evidently prepared,\r\nas one may see by looking again at the sentence I have quoted from the\r\nspeech, in which he declares that \"it is not intended to do more _at\r\npresent_ (the italics are mine) than aim at a rate of 1s. 4d.\" This,\r\ncoupled with statements subsequently made, and by what the Currency\r\nCommittee has suggested as to a farther increase if it should seem\r\nnecessary, shows that the Government evidently contemplates a rise to 1s.\r\n6d.; and indeed this must obviously be the case, as the anticipated gain\r\nfrom a rise to 1s. 4d., when put against the probable loss on opium, and\r\nthe allowances to be made to Government servants to compensate them for\r\nthe loss they sustain on home remittances, would go far to swallow up the\r\ngain to the State from a 1s. 4d. rate. Supposing, then, that the\r\nGovernment should be able to carry out its project of a 1s. 6d. rate,\r\nthe blessings previously showered on the producers will be trebled; so, of\r\ncourse, will be the gain to the Exchequer; and the account will then in\r\nround figures stand thus:--gain to the Exchequer on home remittances,\r\n£4,500,000; loss to the producers, £21,000,000; or, in other words, the\r\nlevy of an export tax of 21 per cent. on all the productions of India,[66]\r\nand a total annual loss to India considered as a whole of £16,500,000\r\nsterling. This seems pretty well for a beginning, but it is really a very\r\nsmall part of the results that may with certainty be anticipated from the\r\nmeasure, which, as Sir David Barbour says, will have far-reaching effects.\r\nOf this, as we shall see, there can be no doubt whatever. Of the direct\r\nloss we can form a rough calculation; the indirect losses are indeed\r\nincalculable. But let me proceed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, at the least, the Government proposes to impose, and\r\nwill impose if it can force up the exchange, an export tax (or what is\r\npractically an export tax) of 7 per cent., which is to be ultimately\r\nraised to 21 per cent. And we have now to follow out the effects of this\r\non the producers, the people generally, and the financial prospects of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe producers in India of articles for foreign export either, as the\r\nplanters generally do, send their produce for sale to London, or, as the\r\nmain body of producers do, sell them to merchants who export the goods.\r\nBoth these classes of producers are of course much benefited by a low rate\r\nof exchange--the former when they sell in gold and remit money to India to\r\npay for the up-keep of their estates, and the latter when they find that\r\nthe merchant can afford to pay more rupees than they could when exchange\r\nwas higher. If then, to put the case in a more precise way, the Government\r\nsucceeds in forcing up the gold value of the rupee, and the merchant is\r\nthereby compelled to turn his sovereign into 15 rupees instead of 16\r\nrupees, it is obvious that to make the same profit as before he must give\r\nthe seller of produce one rupee less. Now let me take the business with\r\nwhich, as a planter, I am most familiar. I have roughly estimated the\r\ntotal value of the coffee annually produced in Mysore at £870,000, and if,\r\nfor the sake of even numbers, we knock off £70,000, a 7 per cent. export\r\nduty on this will amount to £56,000, and if the Government could raise, as\r\nit proposes, the rupee to 1s. 6d., £168,000 a year would be the price\r\nthat the measure would entail on a portion of the inhabitants of the\r\nnative state of Mysore on this single article of export. But this direct\r\ncash loss is far from being all; and if the reader will turn back to the\r\nIntroductory Chapter, and to that on Coffee Planting in Coorg, he will\r\nthere find an explanation of the extraordinary effect produced by the\r\nintroduction of capital into the rural districts of India, and of the\r\nremarkable effects it produces on the prosperity of the people, the\r\ndevelopment of the agricultural resources of the country, and the finances\r\nof the Government. But, for the convenience of the reader, I may briefly\r\nrepeat here what I have pointed out in greater detail in the chapters\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\nFrom the estimate given of the profits of well-managed European\r\nplantations which have been formed on the best land (_vide_ chapters on\r\nCoffee Planting in Coorg, and in Mysore), it is evident that, though these\r\nwould be greatly injured by the exchange being forced up, they could still\r\nmake fair profits; and, indeed, it is conceivable that, from the losses\r\nthat the Government measure would entail, they might ultimately be in as\r\ngood a position as they are now; for there are large amounts of poor lands\r\nwhich, if the Government policy is pursued, would be thrown out of\r\ncultivation, either partially or entirely, and the diminished production\r\nand demand for labour would, of course, be of great advantage to the\r\nestates which survived. And what would largely accelerate the decrease of\r\ncultivation would be the fact that if the exchange is forced up all\r\nconfidence in the Government will naturally be shaken. For how can\r\nproducers have any confidence in a Government which, instead of levying on\r\nthe country as a whole the increased taxes it requires, seeks to attain\r\nits financial ends by manipulating the currency in such a way as to reduce\r\nto the producers the prices of the commodities they grow for export? And\r\nif the gold value of silver is to be forced up to 1s. 4d., and with the\r\ndeclared possibility of its being forced up to 1s. 6d., what is more\r\nlikely than that the Government may persevere with this disastrous policy\r\nwhenever it again finds itself in financial straits? And is it not evident\r\nthat the present financial policy of the Government, and the possibility\r\nof its being further pursued, must give that shock to confidence which\r\nwill at once repel capital and injure credit? And is it not equally\r\nevident that if the gold value of the rupee can be forced up in the manner\r\nproposed, the first effect of this will be shown in a large decline in the\r\ndemand for labour? Now, as pointed out in the chapters previously alluded\r\nto, the results of an increased employment of labour are quite different\r\nfrom what they would be in England, where an increase of employment given\r\nto labourers merely means an increase of comfort amongst the working\r\nclasses, and of the profits of the shopkeepers with whom they deal. For in\r\nIndia, the introduction of capital to be spent in labour in the rural\r\ndistricts means a social revolution, as large numbers of the labourers set\r\nup as cultivators the moment they have saved enough capital to do so. In\r\nsome cases they give up working for Europeans, in others they combine\r\nagriculture with occasional months of work on the plantations, or other\r\nsources of employment; the whole lower classes of the people are thus\r\nelevated, and this tells at once on the finances, enabling (1) rents to be\r\nmore easily paid, and (2) because the finances improve as more land is\r\nbrought under cultivation. Now, not only would a large diminution of\r\nemployment take place in connection with coffee-planting were exchange\r\nforced up, but the same cause would act on the growers of pepper,\r\ncardamoms, and other products, and the prosperity of the province would be\r\nthrown back, and the same kind of result would obviously occur in any part\r\nof India which grows articles for export.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another result from this truly far-reaching measure, as\r\nSir David Barbour justly calls it, which to my mind is the most important\r\nof all--the bearing of it on famines; for we all know that the population\r\nis rapidly increasing, and that of all apprehensions which haunt the minds\r\nof those responsible for the safety of India, those as regard famines are\r\nby far the greatest. And here I must ask the reader to turn back to my\r\nIntroductory Chapter, and consider the facts relating to famines--facts\r\nwhich show how constantly the fear of famine lies before the Indian\r\nadministrator, both from a financial and humane point of view. I ask him\r\ncarefully to survey these facts, and then consider what effect the forcing\r\nup of the gold value of the rupee is likely to have on famine-producing\r\ncauses. And is it not evident that the effect of the measure in\r\ndiminishing the demand for labour must be enormous; that if less money is\r\nspent on labour, less will be spent in improving and developing the\r\nagricultural resources of India, in digging wells and other\r\nfamine-preventing works; and that if the labourers fail to find the amount\r\nof employment they can now readily obtain, the greater will be the\r\nfinancial burden thrown on the hands of the State in times of famine and\r\nscarcity? And must it not be equally evident to anyone possessed of the\r\nhumblest form of human reason that the Government had far better exhaust\r\nevery taxational resource before embarking on a course which, if the\r\nanticipations of Government are realized as to silver, will be ruinous to\r\nthe country, and which, at a vast direct and indirect cost to the people,\r\nwill only, as I have shown, afford a comparatively speaking trifling\r\nfinancial relief to the State? But it is time now to pass to other points\r\nconnected with the measure. And first of all let us glance at the evident\r\npolitical results that must arise from it.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been previously said, it is evident that the Government has\r\narrayed against itself every class in India excepting its own civilian and\r\nmilitary servants, and to these we have only to add, not another class,\r\nbut only a small proportion of the mercantile class. With the exception of\r\nsome just complaints they had to make as regards charges[67] that had been\r\nunjustly thrust on the Indian Exchequer, and which I myself made in the\r\n\"Times\" and elsewhere long before the Congress was even thought of, the\r\nagitators of the Congress had no serious grounds to go upon. But who can\r\nsay that now? Up till lately there was no cause for discontent. India has\r\nnever been more prosperous, and has never shown greater, or nearly as\r\ngreat signs of progress, as she has within the last twenty years. Not only\r\nhas the demand for labour been abundant, but in many instances it has\r\nexceeded the supply. The rates of wages had largely increased, and were\r\nproducing, as I have previously shown, an accelerated quickening of\r\nattention to the development of the resources of the soil. All that the\r\ncountry wanted was to be let alone, and if the financial conditions\r\nrequired increased taxation, no agitator could have successfully\r\ncomplained of this, seeing that it could only have been imposed on account\r\nof that cheapening of silver which has been one of the great causes\r\n(railways were the other) of the increased prosperity which all classes\r\nhave enjoyed in recent years. But, if the Government measure raises the\r\ngold value of the rupee, the agitator will be able to point out that, at\r\nan enormous cost to the producers of India, the Government has only\r\nobtained a most trifling financial relief, and be able to complain with\r\njustice that the Government has lessened the profits of the agriculturist\r\nand diminished the employment for labour. What an admirable advantage has\r\nthe monetary measure of the Government conferred on the popularity of\r\nBritish Rule in India!\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the losses that the measure must inflict on the planters\r\nof Southern India, and my remarks on that head apply equally to the\r\ntea-planters of India; but the latter have, besides, a special grievance\r\nwhich they share in common with the tea-planters of Ceylon, and this\r\ngrievance is also shared in by the coffee-planters, though, as far as I\r\ncan see, hardly to the same extent. This well-founded grievance lies in\r\nthe fact that if no international agreement (and there seems no\r\nprobability whatever of such an agreement ever being come to within any\r\ntime to be even guessed at) is come to between the silver-using countries\r\nin the East, the tea-planters of India and Ceylon will be brought into\r\nunequal competition with their rivals in China, and the coffee-planters of\r\nIndia and Ceylon will in like manner be unfairly weighted in their\r\ncompetition with the coffee producers of Brazil. With reference to the\r\ntea-planters of India and Ceylon the case is very clear, and it is\r\nperfectly obvious that if in India you have silver artificially raised in\r\nvalue relatively to gold, and that in China silver remains unprotected,\r\nthe Chinese will be able to accept a smaller gold value for their tea than\r\nthe Indian producers, and the difference in the exchange may be such that\r\nChina may regain her former position in the tea market, and that Indian\r\nteas may be partially driven from the field; and if we add to that that\r\nthe Indian tea-planter will, in consequence of exchange being forced up,\r\nhave fewer rupees to pay his coolies than he has now, it is evident that\r\nthe result of the Government measure will be most serious to this\r\nindustry. The evidence (Currency Committee) that relates to Ceylon is very\r\ndecisive on this point, and the witnesses examined with reference to tea\r\nexpressed extremely depressed views as to the ruinous results that must\r\narise if the monetary policy of the Indian Government can be carried into\r\neffect. From the correspondence that has passed between the Government of\r\nIndia and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, it would seem that\r\nIndia has no objection to Ceylon establishing its own mint for the coinage\r\nof silver (the silver coins at present in use in Ceylon are rupees) and\r\nthe island would then be in the same position as other silver-using\r\ncountries. But if Ceylon starts its own mint, and is thus able to prevent\r\nthe evils of the artificial scarcity of silver to be created in India with\r\nthe view of forcing up the gold value of the rupee, then it is plain that\r\nCeylon tea-planters would retain their present advantages, which arise\r\nfrom a low rate of exchange, and thus be able to carry on their business\r\non far more advantageous conditions than their Indian rivals.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the effect on the Indian coffee-planters with reference to the\r\neffect of the monetary policy of the Government in placing the Indian at a\r\ndisadvantage as regards his competition with the Brazilian planter would\r\nbe difficult, and I am not in a position to form a decisive opinion on the\r\nsubject; but I may mention that the manager of the London and Brazilian\r\nBank informed the Currency Committee that the production of coffee in\r\nBrazil has largely increased, and will still further largely increase,\r\nowing to the greater facilities of communication, and also the direct\r\ninfluence of a low rate of exchange. The last-mentioned fact gives, I may\r\nobserve, one more instance of the direct effect of a low rate of exchange\r\nin stimulating production, and so swelling the volume of exports. If,\r\nthen, the Brazilians are to retain, and we are to lose, the benefits of\r\nthe cheapness of silver relatively to gold, it is evident that the\r\ncoffee-planters of India must be handicapped in their competition with\r\nthose of Brazil; but I do not hazard a decisive opinion as to the exact\r\nweight of the competition, as I am uncertain as to how far our quality of\r\ncoffee comes into competition[68] with the quality produced in Brazil.\r\n\r\nI must now at least allude to the effects of the measure on the trade,\r\nmanufactures, and railways of India. I regret that I am unable to go more\r\nfully at present into a consideration of the effects on them of this\r\nill-starred measure, but all that the general reader requires to know is,\r\nto use the words of Sir Frank Adam (one of the most important witnesses\r\nexamined by the Currency Committee), that if the Government succeeds in\r\nforcing up the gold value of the rupee, China would be able to undersell\r\nIndia in tea and rice; the Bombay manufacturers would receive fewer rupees\r\nfor their wares, and, as in the case of opium, the advantage would go to\r\nthe Chinese and Japanese; the railways would have little to carry from the\r\ninterior if the rupee prices went down. Finally, I may observe that the\r\ngold industry of India would be largely injured, and that, especially,\r\nmines struggling towards a successful issue would be seriously hampered if\r\nthe gold value of the rupee were forced up.\r\n\r\nBrief though my survey of this great subject may be, I trust I have said\r\nenough to expose the harmonious rottenness of the monetary policy of the\r\nGovernment, and by this I mean a rottenness so complete that it is\r\nimpossible to find a single redeeming feature in the measure that has been\r\nadopted. It is rotten economically, it is rotten financially, and it is,\r\nif possible, still more rotten from a political point of view. Those who\r\nhave knowledge enough to understand the bearing and ultimate evil effects\r\nof the measure are angrily arrayed against the Government now, and when\r\nthe ryots and labouring classes of all kinds experience the fall in prices\r\nand dearth of employment that will assuredly follow if the Government\r\nshould be able to force up the gold value of the rupee, and are able to\r\ntrace this to the action of their rulers, widespread and serious will be\r\nthe abiding discontent which will take possession of the people.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this short notice of a great subject without commenting\r\non what, at first sight, seems the remarkable fact, that the Government in\r\nIndia, as represented by the Viceroy, and those merchants who are\r\nrepresented by Mr. Mackay, President of the Currency Association, have\r\nadmitted that a low exchange has been a stimulus to the progress of India,\r\nand that producers have gained by it. It is true that the Viceroy declared\r\nin his speech in Council of June 26th, 1893, that \"to leave matters as\r\nthey were meant for the country as a whole a fatal and stunting\r\narrestation [_sic_, probably a misprint for arrestment] of its\r\ndevelopment.\"[69] But the cat escapes later on in the speech when a hope\r\nis expressed that one of the effects of the measure will be \"that capital\r\nwill flow more freely into the country without the adventitious stimulus\r\nwhich we have hitherto been unable to refuse.\" The Viceroy thus admits,\r\nwhat everyone knows, that a low exchange has acted as a stimulus to the\r\nprogress of India, and in doing so has given away the whole case for the\r\nGovernment. But no one has ever denied the admission in question except\r\nMr. Mackay; and his absolute denial, when questioned on the subject, that\r\nthe producers of India would be affected by the measure, was subsequently\r\neaten up by himself in cross-examination towards the close of his evidence\r\ngiven before the Currency Committee. But it is of course the rule, to\r\nwhich there are few exceptions, that those who are engaged in the\r\nunfortunate business of bolstering up an indefensible case, invariably let\r\nout something which is absolutely destructive to the cause they are\r\nadvocating; and we find another instance of this at p. 191, Appendix I. of\r\nthe \"Report of the Currency Committee.\" And if Mr. Mackay has given away\r\nthe whole case in London, one of his followers equally did so in Calcutta\r\nwhen a deputation, headed by Mr. Mackay, was received by the Viceroy. And\r\non this occasion Mr. W. O. Bell Irving, as representing over 3,300 square\r\nmiles of land in Lower Bengal, stated that he \"was not prepared to contend\r\nthat in certain respects the ryots and zemindars have not benefited from\r\nthe depreciation of the rupee.\" We thus see that both the Government, as\r\nrepresented by the Viceroy, and the most active supporters of the present\r\nmonetary policy, have admitted that the measure would have injurious\r\neffects on the producers of India--in other words, on those on whom the\r\nfinancial stability of the empire entirely rests.\r\n\r\nAnd the producers of India have as little reason to be satisfied with the\r\naction of the Currency Committee which was presided over by Lord Herschell\r\nas they have with the Government in our Eastern Empire. A glance at the\r\nfirst page of the Report, and at the professions of the witnesses\r\nexamined, will show that this is the case. The Committee was requested by\r\nMr. Gladstone's Government to form, _inter alia_, \"a just estimate of the\r\neffect of a varying, and possibly much lower exchange, upon the commerce\r\nand people of India.\" Now, the people of India almost entirely live either\r\ndirectly (and I think about ninety per cent. do so directly) or indirectly\r\non the land; and yet, though in England there are to be found persons who,\r\nlike myself, are Indian landowners, and who, from having lived amongst the\r\npeople in the rural districts, are well able to testify to the effects of\r\nthe measure on the welfare of the people, not a single Indian landed\r\nproprietor was called before the Committee. If a Parliamentary Committee\r\nwere called upon here to consider any proposed measure that would widely\r\neffect the people of England as a whole, and the landed classes in\r\nparticular, would it not be scandalously unjust if not a single landed\r\nproprietor, or any person directly or indirectly connected with land, were\r\nrequested to give evidence before it? But notwithstanding that a certain\r\nproportion of the witnesses were Indian officials, and that the\r\nexamination of representatives of the classes chiefly concerned (the\r\nproducers) was carefully left out, the weight of the evidence was entirely\r\nagainst the monetary policy of the Government. And yet the committee\r\nsupported the Indian Government. So that this measure has been passed\r\nafter a partial investigation, during which the most important points that\r\nought to have been minutely examined were never even touched upon, and\r\neven then in the teeth of the majority of the witnesses examined, and\r\nwhose opinions, from their character and position, were of great value.\r\nWere it not that the Committee was composed of English gentlemen, who\r\nwould not wittingly do anything but examine into matters to the best of\r\ntheir ability, it would really seem, after a careful survey of the whole\r\nsituation, as if this Committee was a mere sham got up as a shield to\r\nprotect a foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the Indian Government and the Currency\r\nCommittee were acting under the idea that (1) India had been pushed into a\r\nfinancial corner, and (2) in fear of the result of the probable repeal of\r\nthe Sherman Act in the United States; and so, urged on by a panic-stricken\r\nfeeling to rush somewhere, the Government began in haste to burn the whole\r\nhouse down in order to roast its financial pig. As to the first point, the\r\nstate of the finances in India no doubt requires all the care and economy\r\nthat can be exercised; but to imagine, as many people seem to do, that it\r\nhas exhausted its taxational resources, is ridiculous. The salt tax,\r\ntaking the price all over India, is lower than it was fifteen years ago,\r\nand this could be raised without hardship to the people. Import duties\r\nmight be imposed to the amount of several millions. Then, considerable\r\ncharges now defrayed from current revenues might be passed to capital\r\naccount, as they would be in England. And if the worst came to the worst\r\nan export duty of three per cent. might be imposed, for though is would\r\nnot be good policy to do so, it would still be better than the seven per\r\ncent. export duty the Government would practically levy were exchange\r\nforced up to 1s. 4d., and obviously very much better than the twenty-one\r\nper cent. export tax which the Government evidently look forward to, for,\r\nas we have seen, it is aiming at a 1s. 6d. rate. A large saving, too,\r\nmight be effected by going back to the old system of having a local\r\nEuropean force in India. Let anyone consider these points, and weigh the\r\nremarkable and interesting statement quoted from Sir William Hunter, and\r\nhe will at once see that the condition of India generally is full of hope\r\n(or at least was so till the monetary policy was announced), and that its\r\ntaxational resources are by no means exhausted. It should also be\r\nconsidered that as the Government has not only spent large sums in recent\r\nyears in defensive works and public buildings, and at the same time paid\r\noff debt to the amount of twenty-three millions, it would be perfectly\r\njustified in borrowing, if it were necessary, in order to meet temporary\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nNow let me turn to what is the dominant cause of the monetary policy of\r\nthe Government--the dread that if the Sherman Act were repealed exchange\r\nmight sink even as low as a shilling per rupee.[70] What if it did? Let us\r\nexamine the consequences of that to India considered as a whole. The\r\napprehension in question was proclaimed in the Viceroy's speech of June,\r\n26th, 1893, and in considering the consequences of a 1s. rate of\r\nexchange, he pointed out that this would entail an increase of Rs. x\r\n7,748,000 in the remittances required to be made for the home charges of\r\nthe Government, being, curiously enough, almost the exact sum which the\r\npeople of India would lose on their exports were exchange forced up to\r\n1s. 4d. by the monetary policy of the Government. But as the producers\r\nof India would gain largely by the 1s. rate of exchange, the total\r\naccount would stand thus:--loss to the Government say, for the sake of\r\nround figures, seven millions; gain to the producers, twenty-one millions;\r\ntotal gain to India, considered as a whole, fourteen millions. So that if\r\nthe very worst anticipations of the Government were realized India would\r\nbe a large gainer by the fall to a 1s. rate of exchange, and the\r\nfinances could be squared by increased taxation, which, if levied\r\nconsiderably on imports, would be distinctly a popular measure. And, in\r\nany case, the agitators could have no ground to go upon, as I have shown,\r\nas the increased taxation could be amply justified.\r\n\r\nOne word more. I cannot refrain from calling attention to the remarkable\r\ncircumstance that Mr. Gladstone's Government has in a single year adopted\r\ntwo measures which are highly objectionable from political, economical,\r\nand financial points of view--the Home Rule Bill for Ireland and the\r\nCurrency Measure for India; and that both were forced on by arbitrary and\r\ntyrannical action. For just as the Home Rule Bill was forced through the\r\nHouse of Commons with inadequate examination and discussion, so was the\r\nCurrency Measure forced through, not only without adequate investigation,\r\nbut in the teeth of the majority of those whose opinions were laid before\r\nthe Viceroy, and in the teeth of the majority of the witnesses examined\r\nbefore the Currency Committee. But arbitrary and tyrannical action seems\r\nto be the order of the day with the Gladstonian Government; and it is\r\nworthy of notice in this connection that it forced an Opium Commission on\r\nIndia merely to buy a few votes in the House of Commons, and, with the\r\ngrossest injustice, provided that India should pay for a part of the cost.\r\nThe outcry raised has, indeed, brought about a reduction of the charge\r\nthat was to have been made, but, from a statement made in the \"Times,\" I\r\nobserve that the Government has clung to the travelling expenses of the\r\nmembers of the Commission, which are to be charged to India, and probably\r\nwith the view of proving that extreme meanness is not one of the national\r\nfailings.\r\n\r\nAs the English reader might imagine that the Indian Government was solely\r\nresponsible for this measure being passed into law, I may point out that\r\nthe decision of the Cabinet was required and obtained in connection with\r\nthe Currency Measure. From such a Government the producers of India, while\r\nthey have everything to fear, can have nothing to hope. Our sole hope\r\ndepends upon its being turned out, and replaced by an Unionist\r\nadministration which will either annul the suicidal policy that has been\r\nadopted, or at least suspend its action till a full and searching\r\ninvestigation has been made into all the immediate and all the\r\nconsequential results that must arise from the measure in question, should\r\nthe Government be able to force up the gold value of the rupee. If the\r\nfacts adduced in this chapter are substantially correct, the verdict\r\ncannot be doubtful, for these facts prove that the Government proposes to\r\nlevy what is practically a heavy export tax on the products of India, and\r\nin a form, too, most injurious to its best interests, and ultimately to\r\nthe finances of the State. And I say in a form most injurious, because the\r\nGladstonian Government (for the Cabinet is distinctly responsible for the\r\npolicy proposed to be carried into execution) has practically adopted a\r\npolicy of protection, not for the benefit of the productions and\r\nindustries of India, but for the protection and encouragement of the\r\nproductions and industries of those silver-using countries which now\r\ncompete with India. Of all the grotesquely ludicrous policies that have\r\never been adopted by perverted human reason this surely is by far the most\r\nabsurd. By one and the same measure to stamp down the progress of India\r\nand promote the progress of other silver-using countries; to diminish the\r\ntraffic on Indian railways, and correspondingly increase the traffic in\r\nsuch countries; to diminish the volume of India's trade and increase that\r\nof other Eastern countries; to raise a comparatively small sum for the\r\nIndian Exchequer at a vast cost to the producers of India; to diminish the\r\namount of capital that would otherwise flow into the hands of the people,\r\nand to, at the same time, sacrifice all its consequential effects; to\r\ndiminish employment for labour and increase the causes that aggravate\r\nfamines and scarcities; to ultimately diminish the financial resources of\r\nour Indian Empire; to create a serious cause of dispeace (a useful Scotch\r\nword) between us and the people we govern;--such are some of the effects\r\nthat must be produced should the Government be successful in carrying out\r\nthat monetary policy which it has forced on India in the most arbitrary\r\nand tyrannical manner. Can we wonder then that Sir David Barbour, the\r\nIndian Finance Minister, said that the measure would have \"far-reaching\r\neffects, and ought not to be attempted unless under the pressure of\r\nnecessity?\" No such necessity, as I have completely shown, has arisen. Out\r\nof its own mouth, then, does the Government stand condemned.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be interesting to quote the opinion of the great\r\nDuke of Wellington, who, speaking in the House of Lords in 1833 (July 5),\r\nsaid, \"My lords, I wish the noble lords opposite had taken the advice of\r\nSir John Malcolm upon the subject of forming an independent body in\r\nLondon, representing the interests and carrying on the concerns of India.\r\nMy lords, it is persons of this description who interpose an efficient\r\ncheck upon the Government.\" Unfortunately for India there is no such\r\nbody, and the final decision on this great question has rested with a\r\nCabinet composed of men who know nothing of Indian interests, and who,\r\nindeed, have no time to attend to them, seeing that their thoughts require\r\nto be almost exclusively devoted to a consideration of those\r\nvote-catching, parochial politics with the aid of which alone the\r\nGovernment can hope to maintain its balance on the political tight-rope.\r\n\r\nI may observe, in conclusion, that, as regards the effects of the\r\ndepreciation of silver on a silver-using country, we have, in the case of\r\nMexico, circumstances exactly parallel to those in India, and in the\r\n\"Times\" of October 21st, 1893, a most interesting analysis is given of the\r\nreport of our consul at Mexico--Mr. Lionel Carden--as regards the effects\r\non that country of a further serious depreciation of silver. Mr. Carden\r\nsums up his conclusions on the hypothesis that the present value of the\r\ndollar, which is 3s. 1d., falls to 2s. 6d., and proceeds then to\r\nexamine into the effects of such a fall on the country considered as a\r\nwhole. He estimates the losses to the Government and the railways which\r\nwould arise from the sums they have to pay in gold, and then puts against\r\nthem the advantages that the fall in silver would confer on miners,\r\nagriculturists, and manufacturers. His final conclusions are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In striking a balance between the advantages and disadvantages arising to\r\ndifferent interests in Mexico from a depreciation of silver, it must be\r\nborne in mind that the losses which would be sustained by the Government\r\nand the railway companies are essentially limited in their amount, whereas\r\nthe benefits that would accrue to certain of the productive industries are\r\nsusceptible of indefinite extension. Moreover, an increase in the\r\nproductiveness of the country would make itself felt at once in an\r\nincrease of the revenue of the Government, as well as of the railways.\r\nThe only conclusion, then, at which it is possible to arrive is that a low\r\nprice of silver, if permanent, would not only not be prejudicial to Mexico\r\nas a whole, but would conduce to its ultimate benefit by the stimulus it\r\nwould afford to the development of its immense agricultural resources.\"\r\n\r\nYes. The losses from the payments that have to be made in gold are a\r\ncomparatively speaking fixed quantity, while the gain to the people from\r\ncheap silver will yield wide-spreading consequential benefits far beyond\r\nthe reach of calculation. This, too, is the case as regards India; we\r\nrequire for it a Government which can appreciate, and act up to, this view\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] \"Minutes of Evidence taken before the Committee appointed to inquire\r\ninto the Indian Currency, 1893.\" \"Report of Committee appointed to inquire\r\ninto the Indian Currency, 1893.\" \"Indian Currency Correspondence between\r\nthe Government of India and the Secretary of State, 1893.\" \"Abstract of\r\nthe Proceedings of the Council of the Governor-General of India, the\r\nViceregal Lodge, Simla, Monday, June 26th, 1893.\"\r\n\r\n[62] I may mention that formerly anyone could take bullion or ornaments in\r\nsilver to the mints and change them for rupees.\r\n\r\n[63] It is very difficult to form an accurate opinion on this point.\r\nReturns seem at first sight very conclusive, but you require a knowledge\r\nof facts which the returns do not disclose. For instance, in the\r\nGovernment return quoted in the \"Economist\" of September 30th, 1893, it\r\nwould appear that, compared with 1873, there had been an enormous rise in\r\nthe price of ragi--a millet which is the staple food of the people of\r\nMysore. In the table, the prices of 1873 being taken as equal to 100, the\r\nrise from 1876 to 1880 is 209, from 1881 to 1885 the ratio falls to 103,\r\nand remains at that till 1890. Then, in 1891, it rises to 138, and in 1892\r\nto 177. From this return the writer in the \"Economist\" concludes that the\r\npurchasing power of the rupee is now about 30 per cent. lower than it was\r\nin 1873. But to my mind the rupee price of ragi, judging by the returns\r\nand omitting periods of famine and scarcity, has probably only risen 3 per\r\ncent. The high price of the 1876-80 period was caused by the great famine,\r\nand the price in 1891 is to be accounted for by the partial failure of the\r\nragi crop in that year--the country being on the brink of a famine--and\r\nthis circumstance of course affected prices in the year following.\r\n\r\n[64] The amount that the Government would save is about 1,570,000 Rs. x.\r\n\r\n[65] The reader will see that, for the sake of making even figures, I have\r\ntaken the value of the exports at upwards of eleven millions less than\r\nthey really are. The return of the trade of British India for 1891-92 is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n                                                Rs. x\r\n    Private imports                           81,310,119\r\n    Private exports                          111,179,196\r\n    Government imports                         2,844,926\r\n    Government exports                           281,082\r\n                                             -----------\r\n          Total trade                  Rs. x 195,615,323\r\n\r\nThe above figures show that--\r\n\r\n    The export trade is                Rs. x 111,179,196\r\n    The import trade is                Rs. x  84,155,045\r\n                                             -----------\r\n    Net excess exports of total trade  Rs. x  27,305,233\r\n\r\n\r\n[66] I observe that one of the witnesses calculates the export tax thus\r\nproposed to be levied by forcing up the exchange to 1s. 6d. at 20 per\r\ncent., but I have obtained my figures from a highly competent authority,\r\nand I have no doubt they are substantially correct. I may add that the\r\n\"Times\" correspondent, telegraphing from Calcutta on October 23rd, says,\r\n\"Exports cannot be profitably financed. The currency legislation alone is\r\nequivalent to 20 per cent. tax upon them.\"\r\n\r\n[67] As a set-off against the charges complained of, it should be\r\nremembered--a point which I did not take into account when formerly\r\nwriting on the subject--that England bears the cost of the naval\r\nprotection of India.\r\n\r\n[68] I have since ascertained, on good authority, that, though the coffee\r\nof Brazil has not as yet come into competition with Indian coffee (as\r\npeople used to the latter do not care for the former, and would not use it\r\nunless there was a very great difference in the value), the coffee from\r\nCosta Rica, Columbia, Guatemala, and Mexico (all silver-using countries)\r\ndoes so to a very considerable extent.\r\n\r\n[69] It might be imagined from this statement that a low rate of exchange\r\nhad been already setting back, or at least arresting, the hand of\r\nprogress, and I therefore quote the following passage from p. 40 of the,\r\n\"Report of the Currency Committee.\"\r\n\r\n\"The following facts relating to the recent progress of India are taken\r\nfrom a paper read by Sir W. Hunter (one of the greatest existing\r\nauthorities on the subject) at the Society of Arts, on the 16th of\r\nFebruary, 1892.\r\n\r\n\"Between 1881 and 1891 the whole number of the Army had been raised from\r\n170,000 to 220,000, and the number of British soldiers in it from 60,000\r\nto 71,000, or, including reserves, volunteers, etc., to very much more.\r\nMany large and costly defensive works had been constructed, both on the\r\nnorth-west frontier and on the coast. In recent years almost all the\r\npublic buildings have been reconstructed on a large scale.\r\n\r\n\"Railways, both military and commercial, have been greatly extended.\r\nNotwithstanding these extraordinary expenses, there were, during the\r\ntwenty-five years which followed 1862, fourteen years of surplus and\r\neleven years of deficit, yielding a net surplus of Rs. x 4,000,000. In\r\n1889 the public debt of India, exclusive of capital invested in railways,\r\nshowed a reduction since the mutiny period of Rs. x 26,000,000. The rate\r\nat which India can borrow has been reduced from 4 or 5 per cent. to a\r\nlittle over 3 per cent. The revenue of India, exclusive of railways and\r\nmunicipal funds, has grown between 1856-57 and 1886-87 from Rs. x\r\n33,378,000 to Rs. x 62,859,000, and in 1891 it had increased to Rs. x\r\n64,000,000, or, including railway and migration receipts, to Rs. x\r\n85,750,000; and this increase is due to the growth of old revenue rather\r\nthan to new taxation. Further, whilst the rent or land tax paid by the\r\npeople has increased by one-third, the produce of their fields has more\r\nthan doubled, in consequence partly of higher prices and partly of\r\nincrease in cultivation. Further, in 1891 there were nearly 18,000 miles\r\nof railway open, carrying 121,000,000 of passengers and 26,000,000 tons of\r\ngoods, and adding a benefit to the people of India calculated as far back\r\nas 1886 at Rs. x 60,000,000. Further, the Indian exports and imports at\r\nsea, which in 1858 were about Rs. x 40,000,000, amounted in 1891 to about\r\nRs. x 200,000,000, and the produce thus exported has increased in quality\r\nand variety no less than in amount.\"\r\n\r\nWhat evidences of \"a fatal and stunting arrestation of development\"!\r\n\r\n[70] This extraordinary assumption must evidently have been founded on\r\nanother, if possible still more wonderful; namely that the American\r\nGovernment was composed of individuals so short-sighted that they would\r\nfail to take the precautions which men of ordinary common sense would be\r\nsure to adopt with the view of preventing, as far as possible, a sudden\r\nfall in the value of silver. But the American Government, as we know,\r\nnaturally diminished its purchases of silver, and as no one supposes\r\n(except perhaps the Indian Government) that it can be so silly as at once\r\nto lose money and create a gratuitous disturbance by suddenly flooding the\r\nmarket with the silver accumulated, we see that, since the repeal of the\r\nSherman Act, the price of silver, so far from having gone down, as\r\nanticipated by the Viceroy, has even slightly gone up.",
