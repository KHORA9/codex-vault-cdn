Spooner\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\nElihu Root\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that mine adversary had written a book!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the exclamation of one who, through the centuries, has\r\nbeen held up to the world as the symbol of patience and long\r\nsuffering endurance, and who believed that he thus expressed the surest\r\nmethod of confounding an enemy.\r\n\r\nI have come to that age in life where I feel somewhat indifferent\r\nas to consequences, and, yielding to the suggestions and insistence\r\nof friends, I determined that I would undertake to write some\r\nrecollections, as they occurred to me, of the men and events of my\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNaturally, to me the history of the period covered by my life since\r\n1829 is particularly interesting.  I do not think that I am prejudiced\r\nwhen I assert that while this period has not been great in Art and\r\nLetters, from a material, scientific, and industrial standpoint it\r\nhas been the most wonderful epoch in all the world's history.\r\n\r\nAbout the period of my birth General Andrew Jackson was first\r\nelected President of the United States.  Jackson to me has always\r\nbeen an interesting character.  Theodore Roosevelt has declared\r\nvery little respect for him, and has written deprecatingly--I might\r\nsay, even abusively--of him.  But the truth is, there were never\r\ntwo Presidents in the White House who, in many respects, resembled\r\neach other more nearly than Jackson and Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nJackson was sixty-one years old when elected President--an unusually\r\nold man to be elected to that high office; and he had served his\r\ncountry during the War of the Revolution.  When I consider this\r\nthe thought occurs to me, How young as a Nation we are, after all.\r\nWhy, I date almost back to the Revolution!  President Taft jocularly\r\nremarked to me recently:  \"Here's my old friend, Uncle Shelby.  He\r\ncomes nearer connecting the present with the days of Washington\r\nthan any one whom I know.\"  And I suppose there are few men in\r\npublic life whose careers extend farther into the past than mine.\r\n\r\nDuring my early life the survivors of the Revolutionary War, to\r\nsay nothing of the War of 1812, were very numerous and abundantly\r\nin evidence.  Up to that time, no man who had not served his country\r\nin some capacity in the Revolutionary War had been elevated to the\r\nPresidency, and this was the case until the year 1843.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1829 the crown of Great Britain descended from King\r\nGeorge IV to King William IV.  That reign passed away, and I have\r\nlived to see the long reign of Victoria come and go, the reign of\r\nEdward VII come and go, and the accession of King George V.  Charles\r\nX ruled in France, Francis I in Austria (the reign of Francis Joseph\r\nhad not yet begun), Frederick William III in Prussia, Nicholas I\r\nin Russia; while Leo XII governed the Papal States, the Kingdom of\r\nItaly not yet having come into existence.  The United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland had not yet a population of 24,000,000,\r\nall told.\r\n\r\nFrom the dawn of this epoch may well date the practical beginning\r\nof a long cycle of political and intellectual upheaval, and the\r\nreadjustment of relations which go to make up world-history, arriving\r\nat a culmination in our great Civil War.\r\n\r\nIn the last half-century--nay, I might say, within the last two\r\ndecades--there has been a mighty impulse in the direction of\r\nscientific investigation, of mechanical invention, of preventive\r\nmedicine, of economic improvement, and the like.  Germany, in some\r\nrespects, has led, but our own country has not been far behind.\r\nIndependent research has been wonderfully productive, and rivalry\r\nhas been keen.  Often the mere suggestion of one scientist has been\r\ntaken up and elaborated (or discredited) by other scientists; the\r\nidea of one inventor has been seized upon and bettered, or possibly\r\nproved valueless, by other inventors.  The paths to the remote and\r\ninaccessible have been toiled over by rival explorers; new records\r\nhave been made by rival aviators; while competitive and co-operative\r\nactivities in every line have known a phenomenal growth.  New names\r\nhave been placed in the Pantheon of the immortals, new planets\r\ndiscovered in the solar system, new stars added to the clear skies\r\nof our nightly vision.  Out of all the striving has come a sweeping\r\nadvance in lingual requirements.  In most departments of Science,\r\nArt, and Manufacture, the processes and methods of to-day are not\r\nthose of yesterday, and the doers of new things have freely coined\r\nnew words or given new meaning to old ones.  The most complete and\r\nexhaustive encyclopaedia of yesterday is to-day found not entirely\r\nadequate to the already increased wants.  Upon all these momentous\r\nfactors must these \"Recollections,\" in one way or another, touch\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\n  Shelby M. Cullom.\r\n\r\nWashington, D. C.\r\n  _July, 1911_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nBIRTH TO ADMISSION TO THE BAR\r\n1829 to 1855\r\n\r\nTides of migration set in about the close of the Revolutionary War,\r\noriginating in the most populous of the late Colonies (now States),\r\ndebouching from the western slopes of the mountain border-passes\r\ninto the headwaters of Kentucky's rivers, and mingling at last in\r\nthe fertile valley through which those rivers, in their lower\r\nreaches, find an outlet into the Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe westward flowing current brought with it two families--the\r\nCulloms of Maryland, and the Coffeys of North Carolina--who settled\r\nin a beautiful valley, not far from the banks of the Cumberland,\r\nwhich bore the euphonious name of Elk Spring Valley.  Richard\r\nNorthcraft Cullom, of the first-named family, married Elizabeth\r\nCoffey.  They remained in Kentucky until seven children had been\r\nborn to them, I being the seventh, the date of my birth occurring\r\non the twenty-second day of November, 1829.  We were a large family,\r\nbut not extraordinarily numerous for those times, there being five\r\nbrothers and seven sisters.\r\n\r\nKentucky was a Slave State, and my father did not believe in slavery.\r\nHe was fairly well to do, and after considering the situation he\r\ndetermined to seek a home in a Free State and live there to the\r\nend of his days.\r\n\r\nA treaty with the Indians in 1784, at Fort Stanwix, had secured\r\nfrom the Iroquois all claims to the lands which now make up the\r\nStates of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.  At the time of our removal\r\nthe State of Illinois was only eleven years old, and but a small\r\nportion of it had any considerable settlements.  These were mainly\r\nin the south half of the State.  Chicago was then a small village,\r\nFort Dearborn being at that time of more consequence than the\r\nvillage.  Now Chicago is the second greatest city in the Union in\r\npopulation and business.\r\n\r\nMy father, together with Alfred Phillips and William Brown, his\r\ntwo brothers-in-law, entered land in the same portion of the County\r\nof Tazewell, and at once, on their arrival from Kentucky, pitched\r\ntheir tents and began the erection of log cabins, in preparation\r\nfor winter.  Phillips was a large, vigorous man, both in body and\r\nmind.  He was a man of the highest integrity, and soon became one\r\nof the leading citizens of Tazewell County, continuing so until\r\nhis death.  William Brown was a Methodist preacher and was a worthy\r\nexample of the consistent minister of the Gospel of Christ.  He\r\nwas called upon by the people for many miles around to perform\r\nceremonies on wedding occasions and, in time of sorrow, to preach\r\nat the funerals of departed friends.\r\n\r\nMy father lived longer than either Phillips or Brown.  They both\r\nraised large families, and to-day the youngest son of Phillips--\r\nthe Hon. Isaac N. Phillips--is recognized as one of the able lawyers\r\nof the State, and is the reporter of the Supreme Court of Illinois.\r\nMy father was a farmer, but he always took great interest in the\r\naffairs of the country, and especially of the State in which he\r\nlived.  He was a Whig, and believed in Henry Clay.  He took an\r\nactive part in political campaigns, and was several times a member\r\nof the House of Representatives of the State Legislature, and once\r\nof the State Senate.\r\n\r\nTazewell County, in which he resided, became a very strong Whig\r\ncounty, the Whigs having their own way until the Free-soil party,\r\nwhich soon became the Republican party, took its place as against\r\nthe Democratic party.  When that time came, Tazewell, like Sangamon,\r\nbecame Democratic.  Sangamon County, in which I live, and Tazewell\r\nCounty, in which I was raised, were both strong Whig counties while\r\nthe Whig party survived; but when it died, the population being\r\nlargely from Kentucky and other Southern States, naturally sympathized\r\nwith the South on the question of slavery.  They drifted into the\r\nDemocratic party in large numbers, and gave the control to the\r\nDemocracy for a time; and the two parties still struggle for control\r\nin both counties.\r\n\r\nMy father became well acquainted with Abraham Lincoln while the\r\nlatter was a young man.  The first time I ever heard of Lincoln,\r\nwas when two men came to my father's house to consult with him on\r\nthe question of employing an attorney to attend to a law case for\r\nthem at the approaching term of the Circuit Court.  I remember\r\nhearing my father say to them that if Judge Stephen T. Logan should\r\nbe in attendance at court, they should employ him; but if he were\r\nnot, a young man named Lincoln would be there, who would do just\r\nabout as well.  Readers will see by this that while Lincoln was\r\nyet a young man he was ranked among the foremost lawyers at the\r\nBar.  At that time Stephen A. Douglas was beginning to be heard\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nJudge Logan was one of the best lawyers of the Mississippi Valley.\r\nHe was a Kentuckian by birth, and, as a lawyer, was a very great\r\nman.  Douglas was a great statesman and a leader of men; a great\r\ndebater, but, in my opinion, not a great lawyer.  The law is a\r\njealous mistress; there are no great lawyers who do not give\r\nundivided attention to its study, and Douglas devoted much time to\r\npublic affairs.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of my father at the grove where he had previously\r\ndetermined to locate his family, he pitched his tent near a little\r\nstream, then called Mud Creek, afterwards called Deer Creek, because\r\nit was a great resort for wild deer.  He soon erected a log cabin\r\nand moved into it with his family.  I was less than one year old\r\nwhen the family located in Illinois.  We lived in the cabin for\r\nseveral years.  It was not a single cabin, but there were two cabins\r\nconnected together by a covered porch; which was a very pleasant\r\narrangement in both summer and winter.\r\n\r\nFinally, my father built a frame house.  During all this time the\r\nwild deer were numerous, and often I have counted from the door\r\nfrom five to twenty deer feeding in a slough not a quarter of a\r\nmile away.\r\n\r\nI never killed a deer.  The beautiful animals always seemed to me\r\nso innocent that I had not the heart to shoot them.\r\n\r\nThe Winter of 1830-31 was long remembered by the early settlers of\r\nIllinois, and of all the now so-called Middle States, as the \"winter\r\nof the deep snow.\"  For months it was impossible to pass from one\r\ncommunity to another in the country.\r\n\r\nMy education was obtained at the local schools and at the seminary\r\nat Mount Morris two hundred miles distant from my father's home.\r\n\r\nIn my boyhood years there were no common schools.  There were only\r\nsuch schools in the country as the people by subscription saw proper\r\nto provide.  The schoolhouse in the neighborhood in which I lived\r\nwas built of logs, covered with thick boards, and supplied with\r\nrude benches on its puncheon floor for the scholars to sit upon.\r\nWe sat bolt upright, there being nothing to lean against.  There\r\nwere no desks for our books; and had desks been obtainable there\r\nwere but few books to use or care for.  We boys whispered to the\r\ngirls at our peril; but we took the risk occasionally.\r\n\r\nIt was my duty as a school-boy, after doing the chores and work\r\ninseparable from farm life, to walk every morning a long distance\r\nover rough country roads to school.  After I had attained to a fair\r\ncommon-school education, I concluded that I could teach a country\r\nschool, and was employed to teach in the neighborhood; first for\r\nthree months at eighteen dollars per month, and then for a second\r\nterm of three months at twenty.  I think I have a right to assume\r\nthat I did well as a teacher, since the patrons raised my wages\r\nfor the second term two dollars per month.\r\n\r\nMy efforts in teaching school did not secure sufficient funds to\r\nenable me to remain at school away from home very long, and I\r\ndetermined to try another plan.  My father had five yoke of oxen.\r\nI prevailed on him to lend them to me.  I obtained a plough which\r\ncut a furrow eighteen to twenty inches wide, and with the oxen and\r\nplough I broke prairie for some months.  I thereby secured sufficient\r\nmoney, with the additional sums which I made from the institution\r\nat Mount Morris at odd times, to enable me to remain at the Mount\r\nMorris Seminary for two years.\r\n\r\nI never shall forget the journey from my home in Tazewell County\r\nto Mount Morris, when I first left home to enter the school.  As\r\nit well illustrates the difficulties and hardships of travel in\r\nthose early days in Illinois, I may be pardoned for giving it\r\nsomewhat in detail.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Spring of the year.  My father started with me on\r\nhorseback from my home in Tazewell County to Peoria, a distance of\r\nfifteen miles.  A sudden freeze had taken place after the frost\r\nhad gone out of the ground, and this had caused an icy crust to\r\nform over the mud, but not of sufficient strength to bear the weight\r\nof a horse, whose hoofs would constantly break through.  Whereupon\r\nI dismounted and told father that he had better take the horses\r\nback home, and that I would go to Peoria on foot, which I did.\r\n\r\nThe weather was cold, and I was certainly used up when I arrived\r\nin Peoria.  I went to bed, departing early the following morning,\r\nby steamer, for Peru, a distance of twenty-five miles.  From there\r\nI took the stage-coach to Dixon, a distance of twelve miles.\r\n\r\nThere came up another storm during the journey from Peru to Dixon,\r\nand the driver of the stage-coach lost his way and could not keep\r\nin the road.  I ran along in front of the coach most of the way,\r\nin order to keep it in the road, the horses following me.  From\r\nDixon I crossed the river, proceeding to Mount Morris by private\r\nconveyance.  I never had a more severe trip, and I felt its effects\r\nfor very many years afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe days I spent in old Mount Morris Seminary were the pleasantest\r\nof my life.  I was just at the age which might be termed the\r\nformative period of a young man's career.  Had I been surrounded\r\nthen by other companions, by other environment, my whole future\r\nmight have been entirely different.  Judged by the standard of the\r\ngreat Eastern institutions, Mount Morris was not even a third-class\r\ncollege; but it was a good school, attended by young men of an\r\nunusually high order.  In those early days it was the leading\r\ninstitution of higher learning in Northern Illinois.  I enjoyed\r\nMount Morris, and the friendships formed there continued throughout\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether I was a popular student or not, but I was\r\npresident of the Amphictyon Society, and, according to the usual\r\ncustom, was to deliver the address on retiring from the presidency.\r\nDuring the course of the address I fainted and was carried from\r\nthe chapel, which was very hot and very crowded.  I was rolled\r\naround in the snow a while and speedily revived.  I was immediately\r\nasked to let one of the boys read the remainder of the address,\r\nbut the heroic treatment to which I had been subjected stirred me\r\nto profane indifference respecting its fate.  Later I was selected\r\nto deliver the valedictory.  So I suppose I must have enjoyed a\r\nreasonable degree of popularity among my fellow students.\r\n\r\nIt was at Mount Morris that I first became intimate with the late\r\nRobert R. Hitt.  He and his brother John, who recently died, were\r\nclassmates of mine, their father being the resident Methodist\r\npreacher at Mount Morris.  Robert R. Hitt remained my friend from\r\nour school days until his death.  He was a candidate for the Senate\r\nagainst me at one time, but he was no politician, and I defeated\r\nhim so easily that he could not harbor a bitter feeling against\r\nme.  He was quite a character, and enjoyed a long and distinguished\r\npublic career in Illinois.  One of the early shorthand reporters\r\nof the State, the reporter of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, he became\r\nintimate with Lincoln, and Lincoln was very fond of him.  He filled\r\nnumerous important positions at home and abroad, and married a most\r\nbeautiful lady, who still survives.  He was later appointed Secretary\r\nof Legation at Paris.\r\n\r\nBob Hitt told me that he asked President Grant for the appointment,\r\nand the President at once said that he would give it to him.\r\nWashburne, who had been Secretary of State for a few days, and who\r\nwas then minister at Paris, was much astonished when Hitt appeared\r\nand said that he had been appointed Secretary of Legation.  Mr.\r\nWashburne denounced both President Grant and Secretary of State\r\nFish for appointing anybody to fill such an intimate position\r\nwithout his consent.\r\n\r\nAmbassadors and ministers, however, are not consulted as to who\r\nshall be appointed secretaries.  These appointments are made by\r\nthe President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate;\r\nbut Mr. Washburne, as usual, though that he was a bigger man than\r\nany one else, and that an exception should have been made in his\r\ncase.  But, when officially informed of the appointment, he submitted\r\ngracefully, and they got along together quite amicably.  Strange\r\nto say, Hitt represented Washburne's old district in Congress for\r\na number of years--many more years than Washburne himself represented\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was as a member of Congress that Mr. Hitt distinguished himself.\r\nHe did what every man should do who expects to make a reputation\r\nas a national legislator; and that is to specialize, to become an\r\nexpert in some particular branch.  He was peculiarly fitted for\r\nforeign affairs.  He was a man of education and culture, a student\r\nalways, had served abroad for years, had mingled in the highest\r\nsociety, and it is not strange than in a comparatively few years\r\nhe was recognized as the leading authority on all matters coming\r\nbefore the House pertaining to our foreign relations.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Affairs Committee of the House is not nearly so important\r\na committee as the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate, and\r\nI may be pardoned for saying that I am chairman of the latter\r\ncommittee myself.\r\n\r\nThe reason is this:  the Constitution provides that treaties shall\r\nbe made only with the advice and consent of the Senate; hence it\r\nis that all such treaties, and consequently the foreign policy of\r\nthe general Government, must pass the scrutiny of the Foreign\r\nRelations Committee of the Senate while the House and its committees\r\nhave nothing whatever to do with them.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless of all the House committees, that of Foreign\r\nAffairs is at times the foremost, and it never had an abler chairman\r\nthan Robert R. Hitt.  He was certainly in the most remarkable degree\r\nwhat might be termed a specialist in legislation.  He gave but\r\nscant attention to any other branch of legislation.  He had little\r\ntime or liking for the tariff, finance, appropriations, or for any\r\nbranch of legislation that failed to come within his own especial\r\nprovince.  He was, in fact, so indifferent to the general business\r\nof the House that he told me one day that he did not even take the\r\ntrouble to select a regular seat; that when any question came up\r\nin which he was interested he would talk from the seat of some\r\nabsent colleague.  Hence it was that he was seldom seen on the\r\nfloor of the House except when some question was raised concerning\r\nour foreign relations; at which time he was immediately sent for.\r\nAnd it is only justice to him to say that he was the only man in\r\nthe House in his time, and no one has since appeared there, who\r\ncould so successfully defend or attack the policy of an administration\r\nconcerning its foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nThe late Senator Morgan of Alabama, a most extraordinary character,\r\nof whom I shall have something to say later, and Robert R. Hitt\r\nand myself were appointed members of a commission to frame a form\r\nof government for the Territory of Hawaii, which we had just\r\nacquired.  We travelled to Hawaii together.  No two more delightful,\r\nentertaining, or interesting men could be found.  They are both\r\ndead, and it was my sad privilege to eulogize their public achievements\r\nin the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn what I am writing from time to time, now, as the months and\r\nyears go by, when I have the leisure from my public duties to devote\r\nto it, and without knowing whether what I am writing will ever be\r\npublished, I do not want to eulogize any one.  If what I say about\r\nmen and events shall offend their friends living, I can not help\r\nit.  I want only to give my own estimate of the men whom I have\r\nknown.  Robert R. Hitt was a good man; his honesty and uprightness\r\nwere never questioned; he never did a great deal for his district\r\nbut he was one of the most useful legislators in his own line--\r\nforeign affairs--whom I have ever known during my service in\r\nCongress.  I think this is a fair and just estimate of him.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Mount Morris, Professor D. J. Pinckney was president\r\nof the Seminary when I was a student there.  He knew my father\r\nintimately, and naturally took more than ordinary interest in me.\r\nWhen I became ill at school, he took me into his own home and kept\r\nme there for a month or more, treating me with the greatest kindness\r\nand consideration.\r\n\r\nYears after I left the institution he became interested in politics,\r\nand ran as an independent for Congress against Horatio C. Burchard,\r\nRepublican (who was, by the way, a very excellent man and my friend).\r\nBurchard defeated him.  When the campaign was on I was invited to\r\ngo to Galena and make a speech for Mr. Burchard.  It never occurred\r\nto me at the time that I was going into Pinckney's district; but\r\nwhen I discovered the truth, I could not very well back out.  I\r\nmade my speech, but was careful not to say a word against Professor\r\nPinckney, simply advocating the election of Mr. Burchard as a good\r\nRepublican.  Professor Pinckney, however, took great offense, and\r\nwas very cold toward me from that time until his death.  I felt\r\nthat he had been misled, that it would all come right, and that\r\nsome day I would have a plain talk with him; but he died before we\r\never got together.  He has a son now living in Chicago, a prominent\r\ncircuit judge of Cook County.\r\n\r\nAmong other classmates of mine at Mount Morris, was the late General\r\nJohn A. Rawlins, who became a distinguished officer and was General\r\nGrant's chief of staff.  No better, no truer, man ever lived than\r\nGeneral Rawlins.  He was essentially a good man and never had a\r\nbad habit.\r\n\r\nRawlins was a Democrat, and a strong one, during his school days,\r\nand I believe that he remained one until the Civil War.  Robert\r\nHitt and his brother John, together with Rawlins and myself, formed\r\na sort of four-in-hand, and we were very intimate.  We would take\r\npart in the discussions in our society, and Rawlins was especially\r\nstrong when a political question was raised.  I have heard him,\r\nduring his school days, make speeches that would have done credit\r\nto a statesman.  He would have done himself and country credit in\r\nany civil office.  He served as Secretary of War a few months.\r\nLike so many others who entered the war without the slightest\r\nmilitary training, he came out of it with a brilliant record as an\r\nofficer and soldier.\r\n\r\nJudge Moses Hallett, a United States judge, retired, of Colorado,\r\nwas another classmate of mine.  He was an exceptionally good man,\r\nand developed into a very able lawyer and judge.  He is still\r\nliving, and has become quite wealthy through fortunate real-estate\r\ninvestments in the vicinity of Denver.\r\n\r\nBut I fear I might tire the reader by dwelling longer on my school\r\nlife at Mount Morris.  To look back over those happy early days is\r\ninteresting to me; but it is sad to think how few, how very few,\r\nof my schoolmates, then just beginning the journey of life, with\r\nall the enthusiasm and hope of youth, are living to-day.  They soon\r\nscattered, some to one vocation, some to another; some to achieve\r\ndistinction and fame, some failure; but certain it is that I know\r\nof very few who are now living.\r\n\r\nMy health was impaired when I left school, and I returned home to\r\nwork on the farm.  Soon I became strong again, but the labor was\r\nso arduous and uncongenial that I determined upon a change: if\r\nthere was any other way of making a honest living, I would try to\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I had leased a farm of one hundred and sixty acres\r\nfrom my father.  When Spring came I told him that I wanted to be\r\nreleased from my contract; that I had deliberately come to the\r\nconclusion that I could make my living some other way--that I\r\nintended to study law.  My father did not hesitate to relieve me\r\nof my obligations, and the succeeding October, 1853, I started for\r\nSpringfield to enter upon the study of law.  I consulted with\r\nAbraham Lincoln, and on his advice I entered the law offices of\r\nStuart and Edwards, both of whom were Whigs and friends of my\r\nfather.  They were both very good men and distinguished lawyers.\r\n\r\nAt that time Abraham Lincoln and Stephen T. Logan and Stuart and\r\nEdwards were the four ablest lawyers of the capital city.  I studied\r\ntwo years in the offices of Stuart and Edwards, pursuing the usual\r\nlife of a law student in a country law office, and was admitted to\r\nthe Bar in 1855, and elected City Attorney the same year.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, I had been ill of typhoid fever for several\r\nmonths.  During the period of my convalescence, I was advised to\r\nreturn to my home in the country and spend much time riding horseback.\r\nI did so, but the time seemed to drag, and finally I went to the\r\ncity of Peoria to learn whether I could direct my restorative\r\nexercise to an additional profitable end.  The result was that for\r\nseveral ensuing weeks I rode about the countryside, buying hogs\r\nfor Ting & Brotherson; at the expiration of which time I had regained\r\nmy health, was richer by about five hundred dollars, and was thus\r\nenabled to return at once to Springfield and take up again my\r\ninterrupted studies.\r\n\r\nHaving been inducted into the office of City Attorney, I was fairly\r\nlaunched upon a political career, exceeding in length of unbroken\r\nservice that of any other public man in the country's history.  In\r\nfact I never accepted but two executive appointments:  the first\r\nwas an unsought appointment by Abraham Lincoln, after he had become\r\nthe central figure of his time, if not of all time; and, second,\r\nan appointment from President McKinley as chairman of the Hawaiian\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nSERVICE AS CITY ATTORNEY AT SPRINGFIELD\r\n1855 and 1856\r\n\r\nMy election as City Attorney of Springfield signalized at once my\r\nactive interest in politics at the very moment when the war cloud\r\nwas beginning to take shape in the political heavens--a portentous\r\ncloud, but recognized as such at that time by comparatively few of\r\nthe thinking people.  It had seemed certain for years that a struggle\r\nwas sure to come.  Being a very young man, I suppose I did not\r\nrealize the horrors of a civil war, but I watched with keen interest\r\nthe signs of dissolution in political parties, and realignments in\r\nparty ties.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the country seemed on the verge of a war with Spain over\r\nCuba which happily was averted.  The _Black Warrior_ had been seized\r\nin Havana Harbor, and the excitement throughout the country when\r\nCongress prepared to suspend the neutrality laws between the United\r\nStates and Spain was intense.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time also that the famous Ostend manifesto was\r\nissued without authority from any one.  The American representatives\r\nat the Courts of England, France, and Spain met at Ostend to confer\r\non the best method of settling the difficulties concerning Cuba\r\nand obtaining possession of the island.  They issued a manifesto in\r\nwhich they recommended that Cuba should be purchased if possible,\r\nfailing which that it should be taken by force:\r\n\r\n\"If Spain, actuated by stubborn pride and a false sense of honor,\r\nshould refuse to sell Cuba to the United States, then by every law,\r\nhuman and divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from Spain,\r\nif we possess the power.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ostend manifesto was repudiated; but it is certain that we\r\nwould have then intervened in favor of freeing Cuba, had it not\r\nbeen for the dark war clouds which were so quickly gathering over\r\nour own country.\r\n\r\nAmong the other vital conditions which helped to keep the country's\r\ninterest and attention divided at this critical time was the Missouri\r\nCompromise repeal, May 30, 1855.  This repealing act early began\r\nto bear political fruit.  Already treaties had been made with half\r\na score of the Indian Nations in Kansas, by which the greater part\r\nof the soil for two hundred miles west was opened.  Settlers,\r\nprincipally from Missouri, immediately began to flock in, and with\r\nthe first attempt to hold an election a bloody epoch set in for\r\nthat region between the pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions,\r\nfanned by attempts in Massachusetts and other Eastern States to\r\nmake of Kansas a Free State.\r\n\r\nBy methods of intimidation, Whitfield, a slave-holder, was elected\r\nthe first delegate to Congress.  At a second election thirteen\r\nState Senators and twenty-six members of a Lower House were declared\r\nelected.  For this purpose 6,320 votes were cast--more than twice\r\nthe number of legal voters.\r\n\r\nForeign affairs other than Spain's unfriendly activities also had\r\na share in distracting attention.  The United States paid Mexico\r\nten million dollars to be free of the Guadalupe Hidalgo obligation\r\nto defend the Mexican frontier against the Indians.\r\n\r\nMy first experience after I was elected City Attorney, was to\r\nprosecute persons charged with violating the ordinances prohibiting\r\nthe sale of intoxicating liquors.  One of my preceptors, the Hon.\r\nBenjamin S. Edwards, was a strong and earnest temperance man.  He\r\nvolunteered to assist me in the prosecution of what we called\r\n\"liquor cases.\"  The fact is that for a time he took charge of the\r\ncases, and I assisted him.  Life was made a burden to violators of\r\nliquor ordinances that year in Springfield.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1856, was a Presidential year.  I was chosen\r\nas an elector on what was called the \"Fillmore Ticket.\"  I did not\r\nat that time believe very strongly in Fremont for President.  During\r\nthe same year, I was nominated as a candidate for the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the Illinois Legislature, and was supported by\r\nboth the Fillmore party and the Free-soil party and thus elected.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives of the Legislature of 1856 was so\r\nclose that if all the members who had not been elected as Democrats\r\nunited, they had one majority.  If any one of them went to the\r\nDemocrats, the Democrats would have the control.  One of the men\r\nelected on the Fillmore ticket went over, thus giving the Democracy\r\nthe coveted one necessary.  The Republicans, or as they were then\r\ncalled, Free-soilers, attempted to organize the House by recognizing\r\nthe clerk of the previous House, who was a Free-soiler, it then\r\nbeing the custom to have the clerk call the House to order and\r\npreside until a temporary organization was perfected.  The Democrats\r\nrefused to recognize the clerk whom the opposition recognized.\r\nThe Democrats declared by vote the election of a temporary chairman,\r\nnominated and elected a sergeant-at-arms and a deputy, and ordered\r\nthe two latter officers to carry the clerk out of the hall; which\r\nwas promptly done at the expense of a good suit of clothes to the\r\nclerk who departed reluctantly.  This was my first experience in\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nA careful reading of the annals of the State of Illinois will show\r\nthat this incident is by no means unique in its history.\r\n\r\nTo go back a few years, when Edward Coles, who had been private\r\nsecretary to President Madison, was elected Governor, it was by a\r\nmere plurality vote over his highest competitor, and--to use the\r\nlanguage of former Governor Ford--he was so unfortunate as to have\r\na majority of the Legislature against him during his whole term of\r\nservice.  The election had taken place soon after the settlement\r\nof the Missouri question.  The Illinois Senators had voted for the\r\nadmission of Missouri as a Slave State, while her only Representative\r\nin the Lower House voted against it.  This all helped to keep alive\r\nsome questions for or against the introduction of slavery.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, also, a tide of immigrants was pouring into Missouri\r\nthrough Illinois, from Virginia and Kentucky.  In the Fall of the\r\nyear, every great road was crowded with them, all bound for Missouri,\r\nwith their money and long trains of teams and negroes.  These were\r\nthe most wealthy and best educated immigrants from the Slave States.\r\nMany people who had land and farms to sell, looked upon the good\r\nfortune of Missouri with envy; whilst the lordly immigrant, as he\r\npassed along with his money and droves of negroes, took a malicious\r\npleasure in increasing it by pretending to regret the short-sighted\r\npolicy of Illinois, which excluded him from settlement, and from\r\npurchasing and holding lands.\r\n\r\nIn this mode a desire to make Illinois a Slave State became quite\r\nprevalent.  Many persons had voted for Brown or Phillips with this\r\nview, whilst the friends of a Free State had rallied almost in a\r\nbody for Coles.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the defeat of the Democrats at this election, they\r\nwere not annihilated.  They had been beaten for Governor only by\r\na division in their own ranks, whilst they had elected a large\r\nmajority of each House of the Assembly, and were determined to make\r\na vigorous effort to carry their measure at the session of the\r\nLegislature to be held in 1822-23.  Governor Coles, in his first\r\nmessage, recommended the emancipation of the French slaves.  This\r\nserved as the spark to kindle into activity all the elements in\r\nfavor of slavery.\r\n\r\nSlavery could not be introduced, nor was it believed that the French\r\nslaves could be emancipated, without an amendment to the Constitution;\r\nthe Constitution could not be amended without a new convention, to\r\nobtain which two thirds of each branch of the Legislature had to\r\nconcur in recommending it to the people; and the voters, at the\r\nnext election, had to sanction it by a majority of all the votes\r\ngiven for members of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature assembled, it was found that the Senate\r\ncontained the requisite two-thirds majority; but in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, by deciding a contested election in favor of one\r\nof the candidates, the Slave party would have one more than two-\r\nthirds, while by deciding in favor of the other, they would lack\r\none vote of having the majority.  These two candidates were John\r\nShaw and Nicholas Hanson, who claimed to represent the County of\r\nPike, which then included all the military tract and all the country\r\nnorth of the Illinois River to the northern limits of the State.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Slave party were anxious to re-elect Jesse B.\r\nThomas to the United States Senate.  Hanson would vote for him,\r\nbut Shaw would not; Shaw would vote for the convention, but Hanson\r\nwould not.  The party had use for both of them, and they determined\r\nto use them both, one after the other.  For this purpose, they\r\nfirst decided in favor of Hanson, admitted him to a seat, and with\r\nhis vote elected their United States Senator; and then, toward the\r\nclose of the session, with mere brute force, and in the most\r\nbarefaced manner, they reconsidered their former vote, turned Hanson\r\nout of his seat, and decided in favor of Shaw, and with his vote\r\ncarried their resolution for a convention.\r\n\r\nThere immediately resulted a very fierce contest before the people,\r\ncharacterized by lavish detraction and personal abuse--one of the\r\nmost bitter, prolonged, and memorable in the history of the State\r\n--and the question of making Illinois permanently a Slave State\r\nwas put to rest by a majority of about two thousand votes.  The\r\ncensus of 1850 was the first that enumerated no slaves in our State.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I cannot avoid giving a little account of\r\nFrederick Adolphus Hubbard, who was Lieutenant-Governor when Coles\r\nwas Governor.  Hubbard seemed to be a very ignorant man, but\r\nambitious to become Governor of the State, or to attain some other\r\nposition that would give him reputation.\r\n\r\n\"It is related of him that while engaged in the trial of a lawsuit,\r\ninvolving the title to a certain mill owned by Joseph Duncan [who\r\nafterwards became Governor], the opposing counsel, David J. Baker,\r\nthen recently from New England, had quoted from Johnson's New York\r\nreports a case strongly against Hubbard's side.  Reading reports\r\nof the decisions of courts before juries was a new thing in those\r\ndays; and Hubbard, to evade the force of the authority as a precedent,\r\ncoolly informed the jury that Johnson was a Yankee clock-peddler,\r\nwho had been perambulating up and down the country gathering up\r\nrumors and floating stories against the people of the West, and\r\nhad them published in a book under the name of 'Johnson's Reports.'\r\nHe indignantly repudiated the book as authority in Illinois, and\r\nclinched the argument by adding:  'Gentlemen of the jury, I am sure\r\nyou will not believe anything that comes from that source; and\r\nbesides that, what did Johnson know about Duncan's mill anyhow?'\"( 1)\r\n\r\nHubbard, in 1826, became a candidate for Governor of Illinois.  He\r\ncanvassed the State, and the following is a sample of his speeches,\r\nrecorded by Ford:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens, I offer myself as a candidate before you for the\r\noffice of Governor.  I do not pretend to be a man of extraordinary\r\ntalents, nor do I claim to be equal to Julius Caesar or Napoleon\r\nBonaparte, nor yet to be as great a man as my opponent, Governor\r\nEdwards.  Nevertheless I think I can govern you pretty well.  I do\r\nnot think it will require a very extraordinary smart man to govern\r\nyou; for to tell you the truth, fellow-citizens, I do not believe\r\nyou will be very hard to govern, nohow.\"( 2)\r\n\r\nIn 1825, Governor Coles notified Lieutenant-Governor Hubbard that\r\nhe had occasion to leave the State for a time and required the\r\nlatter to take charge of affairs.  Hubbard did so, and when Governor\r\nColes returned Hubbard declined to give up the office, asserting\r\nthat the Governor had vacated it.  He based his contention upon\r\nthat clause of the Constitution that provided that the Lieutenant-\r\nGovernor should exercise all the power and authority appertaining\r\nto the office of Governor, in case of the latter's absence from\r\nthe State, until the time provided by the Constitution for the\r\nelection of Governor should arrive.  He claimed that the Governor\r\nhad vacated the office until the time of the election of a new\r\nGovernor, and declined to surrender.  The result was, the Governor\r\nhad to get a decision of the Supreme Court, which was to the effect\r\nthat there was no ground on which to award the writ.  Coles was\r\nobliged to submit, but not until he had appealed to the Legislature,\r\nwhere his contention was equally unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAt one time, after repeated and annoying application, Hubbard\r\nobtained from Governor Edwards what he had reason to believe was\r\na recommendation for a certain office.  He became a little suspicious\r\nthat the letter was not very strong in his behalf, and in speaking\r\nof it afterwards, in his lisping manner, said:  \"Contrary to the\r\nuthage amongst gentlemen, he thealed it up; and contrary to the\r\nuthage amongst gentlemen, I broke it open; and what do you think\r\nI found?  Instead of recommending me, the old rathcal abuthed me\r\nlike a pickpocket.\"\r\n\r\n( 1) Moses, page 334.\r\n\r\n( 2) Ford, page 61.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nELECTION TO THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE: LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATES\r\n1856 to 1858\r\n\r\nIn the year 1856 I had rather unusual experiences of both victory\r\nand defeat in one and the same political campaign.  As candidate\r\nfor the Legislature I won out, being elected; as the chosen elector\r\non the Fillmore ticket, I went down in the party's defeat.  The\r\nWhig party was in its expiring days, and what was called the \"Know-\r\nNothing\" party was apparently a temporary substitute for it.\r\nFillmore carried one solitary state--Maryland.  Buchanan was elected\r\nby quite a large majority over both Fremont and Fillmore combined.\r\n\r\nThe administration of President Buchanan has been so frequently\r\nand fully described that there is little, if anything, new to say\r\nabout it; but such were the fearful responsibilities incurred by\r\nit for the subsequent bloodshed, that its shortcomings cannot be\r\nentirely ignored in the intelligible presentation of the course of\r\nevents which gave direction to my observations and activities.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1856 had been one of the most exiting and hotly\r\ncontested ever fought in the State.  The only hope the Democrats\r\nhad of success was in the division of their opponents and in\r\npreventing their fusion.  Their denunciations of abolitionists and\r\n\"Black Republicans,\" as they termed their antagonists, were without\r\nbounds.  But here and there some one would be called to account,\r\nas in the case of the late John M. Palmer, since distinguished in\r\nwar and peace, and some years ago candidate of the Gold Democrats\r\nfor the Presidency.\r\n\r\nBetween him and Major Harris, then running for Congress in his\r\ndistrict, there had been considerable ill-feeling.  The major had\r\nwritten a letter to be read at a Democratic meeting at which Palmer\r\nwas present.  It was very abusive of the Republicans, and Palmer\r\nrising, remarked the fact that the author would not dare make such\r\ncharges to the face of any honest man.  Harris, as related by the\r\nhistorian Moses, hearing of this, announced that he would resent\r\nit at the first opportunity.  This Palmer soon gave him by attending\r\none of his meetings.  The major in the course of his remarks indulged\r\nin the most vituperative language against abolitionists, calling\r\nthem disturbers of the peace, incendiaries, and falsifiers; and at\r\nlength, turning to Palmer and pointing his finger at him, said, \"I\r\nmean you, sir!\"  Palmer rising to his feet, instantly replied,\r\n\"Well, sir, if you apply that language to me you are a dastardly\r\nliar!\"  And drawing a pistol, he started toward the speaker's stand.\r\n\"Now, sir,\" he continued, \"when you get through, I propose to reply\r\nto you.\"  The major had not anticipated this turn of affairs, but\r\nprudently kept his temper and finished his speech.  Then Palmer\r\narose and, laying his weapon before him, cocked, proceeded to give\r\nthe Democratic party such a castigation as none of those present\r\nhad ever heard before.\r\n\r\nIt was in the campaign of 1856 that I first began to make political\r\nspeeches.  James H. Matheny, who was then our circuit clerk,\r\naccompanied me to several meetings where we both delivered addresses.\r\nHe was an old Whig inclined toward Democracy, and I was a Whig\r\ninclined toward Republicanism.  The result was I made Republican\r\nspeeches, while Judge Matheny made Democratic speeches.\r\n\r\nOur first meeting away from home was at Petersburg, Menard County.\r\nBeing a candidate for elector on the Fillmore ticket, I made my\r\nfirst away-from-home speech, which I thought was a pretty good\r\nRepublican speech.  Matheny followed me with a hot Democratic\r\nspeech, attacking especially Judge Trumbull, then our United States\r\nSenator.  I remained pretty steadily in the campaign of that year,\r\nmaking about the same character of speech wherever I went.\r\n\r\nFillmore was very popular in Central Illinois, where the Whig party\r\nalso had quite a large following during its palmy days, but he did\r\nnot receive votes enough to come anywhere near carrying the State.\r\nSangamon, my home county, and Tazewell County, where I was brought\r\nup, both gave their majority votes for Fillmore.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John T. Stuart and his partner, the Hon. B. S. Edwards,\r\nwith whom I studied law, besides being able lawyers and first-class\r\nmen, were both Whigs; Mr. Stuart especially took an active part in\r\nthe campaign.  The latter was invited to attend what was called a\r\nFillmore meeting at Shelbyville, several counties away from Sangamon.\r\nIt so happened that he could not go, and the people of Shelbyville\r\ntelegraphed for me.  I went, and it turned out to be a combined\r\nFremont, Buchanan, and Fillmore meeting--at least the three meetings\r\nthere were held all on the same day.\r\n\r\nThe Fillmore camp gathered its forces out in the woods until about\r\ntwo o'clock in the afternoon.  The Buchanan and Fremont crowds then\r\nmarched in, informing the first-comers that they regarded their\r\nright to have the first meeting pre-eminent.  An agreement was\r\narrived at after some little wrangling, and old General Thornton\r\nwas chosen to preside.  He determined that, as I was not only a\r\nyoung man but the farthest from home, I should make the first speech\r\n--an arrangement that suited me very well.\r\n\r\nI made my speech, as good a one as I could, and in closing, somewhat\r\nhurriedly announced that I was obliged to leave for home, much as\r\nI might wish to remain with them to the close of the meeting.  The\r\nresult was that most of the Fillmore people followed me away and\r\ncame nearly breaking up the whole performance.  I urged them to go\r\nback and listen to the other speakers; but they declined to do so\r\nuntil I had gotten off for home.  It was my first venture at speech-\r\nmaking away from home on national issues.\r\n\r\nI worked and voted for Fillmore because I had a very high opinion\r\nof him as a good man, and did not then think very much of Fremont\r\nas a proper candidate for the Presidency.  Subsequently Fremont\r\nbecame better known, and occupied a high place in the estimation\r\nof the people of the United States, as a gallant soldier and a\r\nstatesman, enjoying the unique honor of having been the first\r\ncandidate of the Republican party for President.\r\n\r\nI have taken an active part in every campaign since 1856, excepting\r\nwhen poor health prevented a regular speaking campaign.\r\n\r\nThe animosities of the campaign of 1856 were carried into the\r\nLegislature and kept alive in the House during the entire session.\r\nGovernor Bissell's inaugural address was a dignified State paper\r\nin which he referred to the administration of his predecessor in\r\nhighly complimentary terms.  He concurred in all his recommendations,\r\nbut suggested no measures of his own.  Although he had commented\r\nbriefly upon the Kansas-Nebraska controversy, and in mild terms,\r\nhis remarks stirred the ire of the Democrats.  Upon the motion to\r\nprint the address, a virulent attack was made upon him, led, strange\r\nto say, by John A. Logan, afterwards the foremost volunteer general\r\nof the Union, and a Republican of Republicans.  The rancor of the\r\nDemocrats against Governor Bissell, who at that time was a physical\r\nwreck from a stroke of paralysis, though mentally sound, was largely\r\ndue to their recollection of the fearless manner in which he had\r\nresponded, some years before, to a challenge given him by Jefferson\r\nDavis to a duel.  That episode has long since become historic, and\r\nI need not enlarge upon it here.\r\n\r\nAs was the political temper in the State of Illinois, so was it,\r\nto a greater or less degree, throughout the entire Nation.\r\n\r\nBuchanan's first message repeated the assurance that the discussion\r\nof slavery had come to an end.  The clergy were criticised for\r\nfomenting prevalent disturbances.  The President declared in favor\r\nof the admission of Kansas, with a Constitution agreeable to a\r\nmajority of the settlers.  He also referred to an impending decision\r\nof the Supreme Court, with which he had been made acquainted, and\r\nasked acquiescence in it.  This was Judge Taney's decision in the\r\nDred Scott case, rendered two days after Buchanan's inauguration.\r\n\r\nAn action had been begun in the Circuit Court in Missouri by Scott,\r\na negro, for the freedom of himself and children.  He claimed that\r\nhe had been removed by his master in 1834 to Illinois, a Free State,\r\nand afterwards taken into territory north of the compromise line.\r\nSanford, his master, replied that Scott was not a citizen of\r\nMissouri, and could not bring an action, and that he and his children\r\nwere Sanford's slaves.  The lower courts differed, and the case\r\nwas twice argued.  The decision nullified the Missouri restriction,\r\nor, indeed, any restriction by Congress on slavery in the Territories.\r\nChief-Justice Taney said:\r\n\r\n\"The question is whether the class of persons (negroes) compose a\r\nportion of the people, and are constituent members of this sovereignty.\r\nWe think they are not included under the word 'citizen' in the\r\nConstitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and\r\nprivileges of that instrument.\"\r\n\r\nNegroes, as a race, were at that time considered as a subordinate\r\nand inferior class who had been subjugated by the dominant whites,\r\nand had no rights or privileges except such as those who held the\r\npower and the government might choose to grant them.  They had for\r\nmore than a century been regarded as beings of an inferior grade--\r\nso far inferior that they possessed no rights which the white man\r\nwas bound to respect; and the negro might justly and lawfully be\r\nreduced to slavery for his (the white man's) benefit.  The negro\r\nrace by common consent had been excluded from civilized governments\r\nand the family of nations, and doomed to slavery.  The unhappy\r\nblack race was separated from the whites by indelible marks long\r\nbefore established, and was never thought of or spoken of except\r\nas property.\r\n\r\nThe Chief-Justice further annulled the Missouri restriction, by\r\nasserting that \"the act of Congress which prohibited a citizen from\r\nholding property of this kind north of the line therein mentioned\r\nis not warranted by the Constitution, and is therefore void.\"\r\nBenton said that it was \"no longer the exception, with freedom the\r\nrule; but slavery was the rule, with freedom the exception.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a year of financial distress in America, which recalled the\r\nhard times of twenty years before.  The United States treasury was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nEarly in this year (1856) a Legislature had met at Topeka, Kansas,\r\nand was immediately dissolved by the United States marshals.  A\r\nTerritorial Legislature also met at Lecompton and provided for a\r\nState Constitution.  The people of Kansas utterly refused to\r\nrecognize the latter body which had been chosen by the Missouri\r\ninvaders, and both parties continued to hold their elections.\r\n\r\nThus it may be seen that these episodes were the culmination of a\r\nlong series of events leading to a new alignment of the country's\r\npolitical forces.  The Republican party was the child of this\r\nferment of unrest.  The formation of a new political party, or the\r\nregeneration of an old one, is always due to events, and not to\r\nthe schemes and purposes of men except as events sometimes originate\r\nin such purposes and schemes.  In this case the steps in the course\r\nof events which had rendered the formation of an anti-slavery party\r\ninevitable were:  The pro-slavery provisions of the Constitution,\r\nthe foreign slave trade, the acquisition of the Territory of\r\nLouisiana, the invention of the cotton-gin and its effects, the\r\nMissouri Compromise, the nullification schemes of South Carolina,\r\nthe colonization and annexation of Texas, the Mexican War, the\r\ncontest over the admission of California, the Compromise Measure\r\nof 1850, and finally the repeal of the Missouri Compromise in 1854.\r\n\r\nThe name of the party was an incident only, and not an essential\r\nor very important incident; its principles and purposes were the\r\nvital facts.  When events demand a new party, or the reorganization\r\nof an old one, all resistance is usually borne down speedily.  On\r\nthe other hand, it is a wasteful exhibition of human power to\r\nattempt the creation of a new party by the force of combined will\r\nand resolutions formulated in public meetings.  Abraham Lincoln's\r\ngreat experience or keener penetration, or both, guided him at the\r\noutset of the realignments on political issues, and at the opening\r\nof the Congressional campaign of 1858, I followed him firmly and\r\nwithout mental reservation into the ranks of the Republican party.\r\n\r\nHence it was that I was present on that historic occasion when the\r\nRepublican party of the State of Illinois held a convention at\r\nSpringfield, June 17 of the year named, and nominated Lincoln for\r\nthe seat in the United States Senate, then held by Stephen A.\r\nDouglas, who at that time was usually affectionately referred to\r\nby his partisan followers as \"The Little Giant.\"  This nomination\r\nwas anticipated, and Mr. Lincoln had prepared a speech, which he\r\nthen delivered, in which he set forth, in a manner now universally\r\nrecognized as masterly, the doctrines of the Republican party.  He\r\narraigned the administration of Mr. Buchanan and denounced the\r\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise under the lead of Senator Douglas.\r\nIn that speech he made the declaration, which I remember as clearly\r\nas though an event of yesterday, then characterized as extravagant\r\nbut long since accepted as prophetic:  \"I believe this Government\r\ncannot endure permanently, half slave and half free.\"\r\n\r\nThat address inaugurated a discussion which has no exact parallel\r\nin history--certainly no equal in American political history.  It\r\nintroduced Mr. Lincoln to the country at large, and prepared the\r\nway for his nomination to the Presidency two years later.  On the\r\ndeclaration above quoted Mr. Douglas based many arguments, in vain\r\nattempts to prove that Mr. Lincoln was a disunionist.\r\n\r\nDuring this period Douglas addressed an enthusiastic assemblage at\r\nChicago, and in the course of his speech adverted to the arraignment\r\nof himself by Mr. Lincoln.  He took direct issue with that gentleman\r\non his proposition that, as to Freedom and Slavery, \"the Union will\r\nbecome _all_ one thing or _all_ the other,\" and maintained strenuously\r\nthat \"it is neither desirable nor possible that there should be\r\nuniformity in the local institutions and domestic regulations of\r\nthe different States of this Union.\"\r\n\r\nAn announcement that Mr. Lincoln would reply to Mr. Douglas on the\r\nfollowing evening brought out another assemblage, July 10, which\r\nwas awakened, before the speaker had concluded, to an enthusiasm\r\nat least equal to that which the eloquence of Douglas had aroused.\r\n\r\nThe issues involved in this famous series of debates are too familiar\r\nto all students of our Nation's political history to be considered\r\nat length in these pages.  Mr. Lincoln analyzed and answered the\r\nvarious arguments advanced by Mr. Douglas the evening before; and\r\nthe closing paragraphs of his reply to the insistent reminders\r\n\"that this Government was made for white men,\" were memorable:\r\n\r\n\"Those arguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be\r\ntreated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying;\r\nthat as much is to be done for them as their conditions will allow.\r\nWhat are these arguments?  They are the arguments that kings have\r\nmade for enslaving the people in all ages of the world.  You will\r\nfind that all the arguments in favor of kingcraft were of this\r\nclass; they always bestrode the necks of the people, not that they\r\nwanted to do it, but because the people were better off for being\r\nridden.  That is their argument, and this argument of the Judge is\r\nthe same old serpent that says:  'You work, and I eat; you toil,\r\nand I will enjoy the fruits of it.'\"\r\n\r\nSix days thereafter, July 16, Senator Douglas in a great speech\r\nagain tried to break the force of his opponent's facts and logic.\r\nThis was at Bloomington, and Mr. Lincoln was again a careful\r\nlistener.  On the evening following, July 17, at Springfield, before\r\nan enthusiastic audience, he proceeded to dissect the matters so\r\nplausibly presented.\r\n\r\nAt the same hour Douglas was addressing a Springfield audience of\r\nhis own, ridiculing especially Mr. Lincoln's alleged attitude toward\r\nthe Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nContrasting the disadvantages under which, by reason of an unfair\r\napportionment of State Legislature representation and otherwise,\r\nthe Republicans labored in that campaign, Mr. Lincoln on that\r\noccasion said in the course of his talk:\r\n\r\n\"Senator Douglas is of world-wide renown.  All the anxious politicians\r\nof his party, or who have been of his party for years past, have\r\nbeen looking upon him as certainly, at no distant day, to be the\r\nPresident of the United States.  They have seen in his round, jolly,\r\nfruitful face, post-offices, land-offices, marshalships, and cabinet\r\nappointments, _chargé_-ships and foreign missions, bursting and\r\nsprouting out in wonderful exuberance, ready to be laid hold of by\r\ntheir greedy hands.  And as they have been gazing upon this attractive\r\npicture so long, they cannot, in the little distraction that has\r\ntaken place in the party, bring themselves to give up the charming\r\nhope; but with greedier anxiety they rush about him, sustain him,\r\nand give him marches, triumphal entries, and receptions, beyond\r\nwhat even in the days of his highest prosperity they could have\r\nbrought about in his favor.  On the contrary, nobody has ever\r\nexpected me to be President.  In my poor, lean, lank face, nobody\r\nhas ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting out.\"\r\n\r\nHe affirmed that Popular Sovereignty, \"the great staple\" of the\r\nDouglas campaign, was \"the most arrant Quixotism that was ever\r\nenacted before a community.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of these preliminary speeches of the Congressional\r\ncampaign it was generally conceded that, at last, the \"Little Giant\"\r\nhad met his match, and the intellectual and political appetites of\r\nthe public called for more.  In recognition of this demand, Mr.\r\nLincoln opened a correspondence which led to an agreement with Mr.\r\nDouglas for a series of joint discussions, seven in number, on fixed\r\ndates in August, September, and October.  Alternately they were,\r\nin succession, to open the discussion and speak for an hour, with\r\nanother half-hour at the close after the other had spoken for an\r\nhour and a half continuously.  My friend and schoolmate, the late\r\nMr. R. R. Hitt, an efficient stenographer, was employed to report\r\nthe whole series, and thus we have a full record of the most\r\nremarkable debate, viewed from all points, that has ever occurred\r\nin American history--possibly without a parallel in the world's\r\nhistory.  Vast assemblages gathered from far and near and listened\r\nwith breathless attention to these absorbingly interesting\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the intense partisan feeling that was evoked, the\r\ndiscussion proceeded amidst surroundings characterized by the utmost\r\ndecorum.  The people evidently felt that the greatest of all\r\npolitical principles, that of human liberty itself, was hanging on\r\nthe issue of this great political contest between intellectual\r\ngiants, thus openly waged before the world.  They accordingly rose\r\nto the dignity and solemnity of the occasion, as has been well said\r\nby one who was then a zealous follower of Douglas, vindicating by\r\ntheir very example the sacredness with which the right of free\r\nspeech should be regarded at all times and everywhere.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere described the disappointment I personally felt at\r\nthe result, when the election returns came in.  Although the popular\r\nvote stood 125,698 for Lincoln to 121,130 for Douglas--showing a\r\nvictory for Lincoln among the people--yet enough Douglas Democrats\r\nwere elected to the Legislature, when added to those of his friends\r\nin the Illinois Senate elected two years before and held over, to\r\ngive him fifty-four members of both branches of the Legislature on\r\njoint ballot, against forty-six for Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nOTHER DISTINGUISHED CHARACTERS OF THAT DAY\r\n1858 and 1859\r\n\r\nMore than four months had elapsed since Lincoln's epoch-marking\r\nspeech at Springfield had brought on his great discussion with\r\nDouglas, when on October 20, 1858, Governor Seward at Rochester,\r\nNew York, intensified the political inflammation of the times by\r\nsaying in a notable speech:\r\n\r\n\"These antagonistic systems (free labor and slave labor) are\r\ncontinually coming close in contact.  It is an irrepressible conflict\r\nbetween opposing and enduring forces; and it means that the United\r\nStates must and will, sooner or later, become either an entirely\r\nslave-holding or entirely a free-labor nation.\"\r\n\r\nA book written by a young Southerner, \"The Impending Crisis in the\r\nSouth--How to Meet It,\" was recommended in a circular signed by a\r\nlarge number of the Republican Congressmen, and thus given a vogue\r\nand weight out of all proportion to the standing of the author,\r\nwhose recent death under tragic circumstances at an advanced age\r\nhas drawn the name of Hinton Rowan Helper for a brief hour from\r\nits long obscurity.\r\n\r\n\"Dred, a Tale of the Dismal Swamp,\" by the author of \"Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin,\" served, if such service were at all needed, to keep fresh\r\nin all civilized lands the name of Harriet Elizabeth Beecher Stowe.\r\nThe British Museum has a long shelf filled with different translations,\r\neditions, and versions of her greatest literary work.\r\n\r\nIn the month of September Mr. Lincoln delivered a speech at\r\nCincinnati, in reply to Mr. Douglas.  In that speech he addressed\r\nhimself to the citizens of Kentucky, and advocated the nomination\r\nof Mr. Douglas to the Presidency, upon the ground that he was more\r\ndevoted to the South than were the Southern leaders themselves,\r\nand that he was wiser in methods for defending their rights.\r\n\r\nThis was a form of attack which Douglas had not anticipated, and\r\nwhich he could neither resent nor answer.  As the event proved,\r\nthe seed thus sown was to bear fruit abundantly in results at the\r\nensuing National Democratic conventions, and at the Presidential\r\nelection two years later.  Until June, Mr. Lincoln was unknown\r\noutside of Illinois and Indiana.  Judge Douglas had already taken\r\na high place among the able men of his time of national and\r\ninternational reputation.  In September, Lincoln's character was\r\nunderstood and his ability was recognized in all the non-slaveholding\r\nStates of the Union.  His mastery over Douglas had been complete.\r\nHis logic was unanswerable, his ridicule fatal; every position\r\ntaken by him was defended successfully.  At the end Douglas had\r\nbut one recourse.  He misstated Lincoln's positions, and then\r\nassailed them.\r\n\r\nBut Lincoln was ever on the alert to expose his opponent's fallacies,\r\nand to hold up the author to the derision or condemnation of his\r\nhearers.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln's first fame rests, therefore, on that great debate.\r\nJudge Douglas had long been famous as an experienced politician\r\nand an exceptionally skilful debater.  As lawyers both ranked high\r\nin their State at a time when the bar of Illinois could boast of\r\nexceptionally brilliant and able forensic talent.\r\n\r\nAs it is my purpose to treat of both these great men in some detail\r\nin subsequent pages of this work, devoting at least a full chapter\r\nto Mr. Lincoln, so long my admired and never failing friend, I\r\nshall now proceed to give some personal recollections concerning\r\ncertain other of the distinguished characters of that day, chiefly\r\nthose connected with the bar.\r\n\r\nI knew Judge David Davis very well.  He was Circuit Judge on our\r\nState circuit for a number of years, and until Mr. Lincoln became\r\nPresident, when he was made Associate Justice of the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States.  When a young lawyer Davis was a Whig; and\r\nmy father, being also a Whig, took a great interest in him, as he\r\ndid in every young lawyer he knew who became affiliated with that\r\nparty.  My father thought himself justified in believing that Davis\r\nwould become a power in the land.  Hence he took up the young man\r\nsoon after he had settled in the practice of the law at Bloomington;\r\nand I have heard him state that he gave Davis the first case he\r\never had in Tazewell County, by advising another to employ him.\r\nBut he re-enacted, on the less conspicuous forum, the distressing\r\nexperience of failure of Disraeli in his first attempt to address\r\nthe English House of Commons.  Davis broke down in the speech he\r\nhad prepared to make, to the great mortification of my father, who\r\nhad exhibited such unusual pride and confidence as to counsel his\r\nemployment in the case.  Subsequently Davis redeemed himself, as\r\ndid Disraeli, and became a most prominent and successful lawyer.\r\n\r\nAmong other interesting circumstances of his career was that of a\r\nlittle claim he had for a client in Boston against a merchant in\r\nChicago.  He could not collect the debt, except by levying on a\r\ntract of land in Chicago--eighty acres, I think.  Davis reported\r\nwhat he had done, and his client manifested dissatisfaction with\r\nthe result.  He so vigorously stated his disappointment to Davis,\r\nthat the latter immediately redeemed the land by taking it himself\r\nand paying the amount of money due the client.  This tract grew in\r\nvalue with the growth of Chicago until it became worth a million\r\ndollars or more.\r\n\r\nJudge Davis was a remarkably popular man on his circuit.  He was\r\nthoroughly honest, and could not endure a dishonest man on the\r\nwitness-stand or anywhere else.  I remember a man in Chicago who\r\non one occasion filed a bill of discovery for the purpose of finding\r\nreal estate that he seemed once to have had an interest in, and\r\nwhich also involved the insertion of Judge Davis's own name, since\r\nhe had himself at one time owned the tract of land involved.  The\r\nman had lost his voice to a considerable extent, so that he had\r\ncome to be called \"Whispering Smith.\"  He became notorious as a\r\nsuccessful collector of debts, where persons had failed and were\r\nunable to pay their debts.  He had filed in this case a bill of\r\ndiscovery consisting of thirty or forty printed pages which included\r\nthe names of many persons who had been found to have owned the real\r\nestate at one time or another, among them being Judge Davis.\r\nDiscovering this, and being entirely innocent of any complicity\r\nwith the party who had failed, the Judge denounced Smith in open\r\ncourt for the outrage of swearing to something he did not know\r\nanything about, and practically threw him out of court.\r\n\r\nThere was an incident characteristic of his fidelity to friendships\r\nwhich I think well worth relating.  It occurred when I was Governor\r\nof Illinois.  I was invited by the Agricultural Society of McLean\r\nCounty to deliver an address, and went to Bloomington on the day\r\ndesignated.  I was called upon by Judge Davis, who resided there.\r\nHe was a very polite man, and asked me if he could not take me out\r\nto the fair-ground.  I told him I would be delighted if he would\r\ndo so.  He came for me with his carriage, and on our arrival at\r\nthe grounds took me to the stand, disregarding the prearrangements\r\nof the officials of the fair, and introduced me to the audience.\r\nIn doing so he made a speech, very complimentary to my father, but\r\nscarcely mentioning me at all--not more than to introduce me at\r\nthe end of his eulogistic remarks.  Many of the lawyers of the town\r\nwere present.  I knew them all, and they were much amused at this\r\nunusual style of introduction.  And so was I.  I knew, of course,\r\nthat he was a great friend of my father, and a great friend of mine\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nJudge Davis was elected to the Senate in 1877 to succeed General\r\nLogan, and resigned his seat on the bench to accept the position.\r\nHe became quite fond of the Senate, and during his one term there\r\nhe was elected president _pro tempore_ of the body under somewhat\r\nunusual conditions.  The Senate at that time was almost evenly\r\ndivided between the two parties.  The two senators from New York,\r\nhowever (both Republicans), and Mr. Aldrich, of Rhode Island, had\r\nbeen elected by their respective Legislatures, but had not taken\r\ntheir seats.  This gave the Democrats a temporary majority, and\r\nthe Senate proceeded to elect Senator Bayard, of Delaware, as its\r\npresident _pro tempore_.  Within the next day or two, however, the\r\ntwo New York senators and Senator Aldrich were admitted to their\r\nseats; this left a majority of two for the Republicans if Davis\r\nacted with them, and the two parties tied if Davis acted with the\r\nDemocrats.  Under these circumstances, General Logan, who after\r\nbeing out for two years had been re-elected to the Senate, moved\r\nin the caucus that David Davis be the Republican candidate for\r\npresident _pro tempore_.  Later he made the nomination in the Senate\r\nitself, and Senator Davis was elected, Senator Bayard descending,\r\namid general laughter, from the chair which he had occupied for\r\nbut a short time.\r\n\r\nSenator Davis was very proud of the position of president _pro\r\ntempore_, which he retained to the end of his Senate term.  He had\r\nbeen acting quite independently, but seemed to incline a little\r\ntoward the Democrats.  After he became president _pro tempore_,\r\nwhile he never announced himself a Republican, he generally acted\r\nwith the Republicans.\r\n\r\nI was in the Senate the day before Senator Davis's term expired.\r\nHe was soliloquizing to himself in the intervals of putting motions\r\nand attending to the routine of his office.  He was very fond of\r\nSenator Isham G. Harris of Tennessee, and when he had occasion to\r\ncall a senator to the chair, generally it would be Harris.  He\r\ncalled Harris to him while I was there, and I heard him say as his\r\nfriend came up:  \"Harris, Harris!  When I get out of here I won't\r\nhave to listen to old Bayard any more!\"\r\n\r\nHe was a very remarkable man and a friend of Lincoln, and Lincoln\r\nwas a friend of his.  I suppose that Davis did as much to secure\r\nLincoln's nomination over Seward as any one man, although Judge\r\nLogan worked with equal zeal.  But Davis knew more people than did\r\nJudge Logan, although the latter was, in my opinion, the better\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Davis's judicial life on the State bench, the judge\r\nand the lawyer had a pretty large circuit.  Davis's circuit was\r\ncomposed of several large counties.  It was the custom to travel\r\nthe circuit, judge, lawyers, and all, together.  At that period\r\nthere were no railway facilities worth mentioning, and they had to\r\ngo by private conveyance--wagon or carriage or on horseback as the\r\ncase might be.  Probably a dozen lawyers might go together, all\r\nputting up at the same hotel, and generally having a good time at\r\nnight, spinning yarns.  Lincoln was a good story-teller, and so\r\nwas Davis; and the evenings were made exceedingly agreeable to all\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIn no small measure as a result of the influences thus put into\r\noperation, the lawyers of the period were better qualified to get\r\nalong in life than those of later days; that is to say, for the\r\nrough-and-tumble life they were better able to take care of themselves\r\nthan the lawyers of a more recent date have been, as a general rule.\r\n\r\nJudge Stephen T. Logan was, I think, the best lawyer that I have\r\never known in Illinois.  He went to Illinois at an early age and\r\nlived there until his death; he had attained the age of a little\r\nmore than eighty years before he died.  He was purely a lawyer.\r\nI think I never knew another lawyer who could so everlastingly ruin\r\na man who undertook to misrepresent the truth.  He seemed to\r\nunderstand intuitively whether a man was trying to tell the truth\r\nor was lying; if the latter, his words would so effectually be torn\r\nto pieces that they could be of no earthly value.  But he was not\r\nan adept as a politician.  He ran for Congress at one time against\r\na man named Thomas L. Harris, and was beaten.  He also ran later\r\nfor Judge of the Supreme Court, and was beaten.  This defeat was\r\nnot his fault, however, as the community was a strongly Democratic\r\none.  I recall a story current in those days, to the effect that\r\nsome man who had recently come from the east inquired, while talking\r\nwith him, \"By the way, Judge, didn't you run for the Supreme Court\r\nlast year?\"  In his squeaky voice, the judge replied, \"No; I hardly\r\nwalked.\"\r\n\r\nBut the judge was a true man in every respect,--honest, faithful\r\nto his friends, and fearless in doing whatever he believed to be\r\nright.  He felt, I think, a little bit disappointed that President\r\nLincoln did not appoint him instead of Davis a Judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nI came to Washington and saw Mr. Lincoln in Judge Logan's behalf\r\nwithout any suggestion that I do so from Logan or any one else,\r\nbut simply because I believed that the President ought to appoint\r\nhim on the Supreme Bench in preference to any other man in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nLogan was a better lawyer than Davis; but Davis was an abler\r\npolitician than Logan.  I have always felt that in view of the fact\r\nthat Lincoln and Logan had been partners earlier, and also neighbors\r\nand close friends, he ought to have nominated Logan instead of\r\nDavis.  Davis, Logan, and Browning were all well qualified for the\r\nSupreme Court, all of them friends of Lincoln, and all Whigs.\r\nLincoln had to make the choice, and I think the selection was\r\ninfluenced by Davis's great assistance in securing his nomination.\r\n\r\nJudge Logan was also a close Whig friend of my father, and earnest\r\nin his friendship for me on that account.  When I was a candidate\r\nfor the nomination for Governor I had a pretty stiff fight for the\r\nfirst term.  There were rumors that men were going to attack my\r\npersonal character.  I did not know about the judge's action in\r\nthe premises, but when the convention met, Judge Logan went to it\r\nas a private citizen and crowded himself into the hall, remaining\r\nhere until I was nominated.  Then he went home.  I was told afterwards\r\nthat he had gone there for the purpose of defending me in case of\r\nan attack against my personal character.\r\n\r\nOf course, I could not but greatly appreciate a friendship so\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\nHe had a son, David Logan, who went to Oregon as a young lawyer,\r\nand became very eminent there.  In later years the judge wrote to\r\nhim, proposing that if he would come back home he would take him\r\ninto partnership.  To this the father received a reply from David,\r\nproposing that if he would come out there a partnership with the\r\nson was subject to his acceptance or refusal.  The judge died after\r\nattaining full four-score years, and the son at an age less\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nI think Judge Logan also felt a bit sour toward Mr. Lincoln because\r\nthe latter, he thought, ought to have been more helpful than he\r\nwas to his son in his effort to be elected to the United States\r\nSenate from Oregon, at the time Baker was elected.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Judges Logan and Davis, I am reminded of the exceptionally\r\nhigh character of the lawyers of Illinois of that day, and more\r\nespecially of Springfield.  I think there has never been a time\r\nwhen it had another such splendid bar.  It must be that high personal\r\ncharacter in leaders has a direct and marked influence in elevating\r\nthe general characters of the followers.  The young lawyers,\r\nespecially, are impelled by a force implanted by nature to admire\r\nand to strive to imitate or attain to the great qualities manifested\r\nin life of those to whom leadership is conceded by common consent.\r\n\r\nColonel E. D. Baker was a very good lawyer.  Also Orville H.\r\nBrowning, of Quincy, who was in Springfield attending the various\r\ncourts whose sittings were at the State capital much of the time.\r\nThen there was Archibald Williams; and Stephen A. Douglas, a great\r\nman in every way, was on the bench a part of the time.  Abraham\r\nLincoln was, of course, the equal of any man, on the bench or off\r\nof it.  Such men prominently in the lead as lawyers, and as men\r\namong men, could not but stimulate the ambitions and loftier\r\naspirations of other lawyers, especially the younger ones.  In\r\nstriving to pay the tributes--imitation, etc.,--that can be accorded\r\nto greatness, they become great themselves; and perhaps here may\r\nbe found the real or chief cause of the very large numbers of\r\nconspicuously eminent men congregated at the capital of Illinois\r\nin those days.\r\n\r\nJudge Lyman Trumbull I always regarded as one of the exceptional\r\nlawyers of the country.  I came to know him well while I was a\r\nmember of the House and he a United States Senator.  During those\r\ndays I saw very much of him.  When Trumbull came to the Senate\r\nthere was some prejudice against him, growing out of circumstances\r\n(related elsewhere in these pages) which prevented the election of\r\nMr. Lincoln, and which seemed to be plainly within Mr. Trumbull's\r\ncontrol.  But the feeling soon vanished, and Trumbull's course in\r\nthe Senate was so true to the principles of the party which Mr.\r\nLincoln had championed, that the manner in which he had secured\r\nthe election was soon forgotten, or at least condoned, and the\r\njudge remained there for a long period of service--three terms.\r\n\r\nWhile he was there I came to the House of Representatives, and came\r\nto be, as our association grew more and more intimate, very fond\r\nof Senator Trumbull.  I also admired his ability.  He was one of\r\nthe few in that body who could hold his own with Judge Douglas in\r\ndebate, and when he came into the Senate he at once took issue with\r\nDouglas, they being in controversy with each other very frequently\r\non slavery and other political questions, until Douglas's career\r\nended, about the beginning of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nI was, perhaps, as intimate personally with Judge Trumbull during\r\nmy stay in the House as any other member.  Barton C. Cook and Norman\r\nB. Judd also were as intimate with the judge, as any other members\r\nof the Illinois delegation.  Nothing ever happened to change these\r\nconditions, until the vote which Trumbull cast against the impeachment\r\nof Andrew Johnson.  Mr. Cook and Mr. Judd, especially the latter,\r\nseemed to be almost bitterly angry against Judge Trumbull.\r\n\r\nAs a result of that vote opposition to him began to grow in the\r\nparty.  However, almost immediately after the impeachment he was\r\nre-elected, although at the time not a candidate.  He was subsequently\r\nnominated by the Democratic party for Governor of Illinois.  I ran\r\nagainst him as the candidate of the Republican party, and was\r\nelected over him by a majority of about thirty-eight thousand.  He\r\nimagined, so I have heard, that he was going to beat me, and was\r\nconsiderably surprised at his failure to do so.\r\n\r\nHe died only a few years ago, at an advanced age.  His first wife\r\nwas a sister of Dr. Jayne, an excellent man, and, I am glad to add,\r\nhe and I are warm personal friends.  I am very sorry to say, though,\r\nthat his children, I believe, are all gone, as are mine.\r\n\r\nThere were other men who had risen to prominence in Illinois, of\r\nwhom I wish to write, and some who were then new upon the stage of\r\npublic life, whom I knew and who subsequently achieved distinction.\r\nI have already postponed my reminiscences of Mr. Lincoln to a later\r\nchapter than I could wish, but in point of time we have now come\r\nto the year of his nomination and election to the Presidency of\r\nthe United States, and the beginning of a career which was to be\r\nfinished in the course of only a little over four years.\r\n\r\nThe reference to my old friend Doctor William Jayne reminds me that\r\nI should say something of my Springfield friends,--some living,\r\nbut many dead.  It is to these friends that I am indebted for my\r\nsuccess in public life, and they have generally loyally supported\r\nme, although friends in other parts of the State have been quite\r\nas loyal and devoted to my interests when I have been a candidate\r\nfor high public office.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Lincoln, I do not believe that there ever was a\r\ncommunity that contained so many really splendid men, men who were\r\nso well fitted to fill any place in the State or Nation, as did\r\nSpringfield.  I can refer to only a few of those of State and\r\nNational renown.  If I have overlooked some whom I should have\r\nmentioned, I hope I shall be pardoned.\r\n\r\nFirst of all comes Lincoln.  From time to time, as I have written\r\nthese recollections, I have spoken of him.  I will later give my\r\nestimate of Douglas, who, while not a citizen of Springfield, spent\r\na great deal of time there as a member of the Supreme Court, as a\r\nmember of the Legislature, and on legal, political, and social\r\naffairs.  In the last-mentioned connection he at one time was a\r\nrival for the hand of Mary Todd, afterwards Mrs. Abraham Lincoln.\r\nI have thought and written something of Stephen T. Logan, and to\r\nmy own old law partner, Milton Hay, I refer in other parts of these\r\nrecollections.  There were no better lawyers in their day.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, was a capable lawyer\r\nalso.  He wrote an excellent life of his distinguished partner.\r\nHerndon was one of the earliest Republicans of his State.  While\r\nLincoln believed in the principles of the party from the very\r\nbeginning, the truth is, he was a little slow in becoming a member\r\nof it; and Herndon always claimed that he had much to do with making\r\nAbraham Lincoln an active member of the Republican party.  Herndon\r\nbelieved that he was qualified to fill almost any office, and I\r\nthink he was a little dissatisfied that Lincoln did not give him\r\nsome high position.\r\n\r\nWilliam Butler, belonging to this same period, was one of the\r\nleading citizens and a devoted friend of Lincoln and an excellent\r\nman.  Nor can I forget Antram Campbell, one of my first law partners.\r\nWe were always warm friends.  I saw him on his death-bed when I\r\nreturned home from Washington, where I was serving as a Member of\r\nCongress.  He recognized me, but could not speak, and I can see\r\nnow the tears falling from his eyes.\r\n\r\nOf the State officers of that day, Richard Yates was Governor.\r\nThe State, under the lead of its War Governor, did not waste time\r\nor spare money in putting the troops in readiness for the field,\r\nand perhaps there was no governor of any State more watchful of\r\nthe State's interests, or more devoted to the interests of the\r\nUnion, or more loved by the people of his own State, including the\r\ntroops in the field, than was Governor Yates.  He was loyalty\r\nitself, and for many years was an apostle of liberty.  He retired\r\nfrom the office of governor, to take his place as a senator from\r\nIllinois in the United States Senate.  His fame, however, rests on\r\nbeing the great War Governor of the State of Illinois, the compeer\r\nof Morton, Andrews, and Curtin.\r\n\r\nHis son, Richard Yates, many years later succeeded to the office\r\nof governor, and is one of the prominent men of Springfield to-day.\r\n\r\nO. M. Hatch was Secretary of State.  He was among my early influential\r\nfriends in Springfield.  Uncle Jesse K. Dubois, for whom I had high\r\nregard, and who was quite well known in and out of Illinois, was\r\none of the State officers.  O. H. Miner was Auditor of the State\r\nat one time.  He was a very good man.  His son, Louis Miner, and\r\nHarry Dorwin, a nephew of my deceased wife, are joint owners of\r\nthe Springfield _Journal_, one of the oldest Republican organs of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nColonel John Williams could not be said to be a National or State\r\ncharacter, but he was a good business man, and one of the best\r\nfriends I ever had, so I cannot refrain from a passing tribute to\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\nWhen I was elected to Congress the first time, in 1864, my friends\r\nknew that I had spent a considerable sum of money for election\r\nexpenses.  It being Lincoln's district, and Lincoln being a candidate\r\nfor re-election as President, the National Committee helped some;\r\nbut I was naturally compelled to spend a great deal myself.  I\r\nconsidered to whom I should apply for assistance, and thought of\r\nColonel Williams.  I went to him, candidly explaining that I should\r\nbe unable to make the race without financial assistance; he told\r\nme to draw on him for whatever funds I might want, and at the end\r\nto let him know the total amount, and that he would take care of\r\nit.  I did so.  He gave me what I asked for, and I gave him my\r\nnote, which I paid as soon as I could; but he never bothered me\r\nabout it.  I always had a warm spot for him in my heart.\r\n\r\nNicholas H. Ridgely, the grandfather of the Hon. William Barret\r\nRidgely, who married one of my daughters, and who served as United\r\nStates Comptroller of the Currency for a number of years, was one\r\nof the leading bankers of the State, and was reputed to be one of\r\nthe first millionaires of Illinois.  He was a very careful banker,\r\nand was probably too careful to be popular among the people generally;\r\nbut every one knew that there was no sounder institution in the\r\nState than the Ridgely National Bank.  His son, Charles Ridgely,\r\nwhom I always regarded as one of the most interesting men in\r\nSpringfield, has passed away just about the time that I am writing\r\nthese lines.  Mr. Charles Ridgely was a man of great reading and\r\ngreat cultivation, and a man whom any one would like to meet.  His\r\ndeath was a loss to Springfield of one of its most interesting and\r\nenterprising characters.\r\n\r\nS. H. Jones (\"Sam\" Jones, as he was known) was another well-known\r\ncharacter in Springfield, as well as throughout Illinois.  He was\r\na warm friend and supporter of mine in the early days.\r\n\r\nJames C. Robinson was twice elected to Congress.  He and Governor\r\nOglesby were opponents for State Senator from the district.  A\r\nlittle story in this connection occurs to me, which Oglesby used\r\nto tell.\r\n\r\nWhen running for the Senate, before the Civil War, Oglesby and\r\nRobinson travelled together over the district.  The settlements in\r\nthose days were very scattering, and as the rivals were good friends\r\npersonally they agreed to go together and hold joint discussions.\r\nThey held one every day, the understanding being that if either\r\ndesired to talk anywhere else aside from the joint debate he had\r\na right to do so.\r\n\r\nAt one place Robinson announced that he would make a speech in the\r\ncourthouse.  A large crowd greeted him, which he captured with one\r\nof his characteristic speeches.  Oglesby was sitting in front of\r\nthe hotel across the way by himself, and listening to the cheering.\r\nHe became very uneasy lest Robinson should get the best of it.\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that Oglesby could play a violin splendidly.  A man\r\ncame along with one in his hands, and Oglesby asked if he might\r\nborrow it for the evening, to which the man consented.  He commenced\r\nplaying in order to attract the crowd from Robinson, and in order\r\nto break up his meeting.  He succeeded; one by one they came out\r\nof the courthouse, and when Oglesby swung into a stirring dance\r\nmeasure the crowd at once responded with an impromptu hoe-down.\r\n\r\nRobinson, seeing his audience dwindling, quit speaking and came\r\nout himself.  Taking in the situation at a glance, he pulled off\r\nhis shoes and became the most enthusiastic participant, dancing\r\nfirst with one and then with another of his late hearers, winning\r\nthem all back again and completely turning the tables against his\r\nadroit opponent.\r\n\r\nThis is a good illustration of early campaigning in the country\r\ndistricts of Illinois.  There was the utmost good feeling, and a\r\ndisposition to let the best man win.\r\n\r\nAmong the early men and incidents connected with the practice of\r\nthe law in Springfield, in the sixties, and before and during the\r\ntime I was Speaker of the House, the Rev. Peter Cartwright must\r\nnot be forgotten.  He was one of the prominent figures in the\r\npioneer educational and religious life of the Western country, more\r\nparticularly of Illinois.  He was a wonderful type of the times--\r\na man of great courage, of considerable ability, and most remarkable\r\nin his capacity as a minister of the Gospel.  He believed in camp-\r\nmeetings; and when Peter Cartwright conducted a camp-meeting the\r\nloafers and rowdies inclined to interrupt the worship knew they\r\nwould invite trouble if they ventured to interfere with or annoy\r\nthe meeting.  He was ready, not only to preach the Gospel but to\r\nfight, as sometimes he felt it his duty to do.  No man dared in\r\nthe presence of Cartwright to interrupt the meeting, as in those\r\ntimes irresponsible parties hanging about such gatherings frequently\r\nattempted to do in his absence.\r\n\r\nCartwright was not only an able pioneer preacher, but he was a\r\nloyal Democrat, too.  He believed in Democracy, and was ready to\r\nrun on the Democratic ticket, or to advance the party's cause in\r\nany other way.  He was nominated for Congress as against Mr. Lincoln,\r\nthe only time Lincoln ever ran for Congress.\r\n\r\nSome persons disapproved of Cartwright's activity in politics,\r\nquestioning the propriety of it on the part of a minister.  Among\r\nthese was Judge Treat, then our Federal Judge in the Springfield\r\ndistrict.  The story goes that the Judge signified to Mr. Lincoln\r\nhis dislike of Cartwright, and his willingness to lend a helping\r\nhand in case Lincoln should need help and would let him know the\r\nfact.  He thought he could get a good many votes for Lincoln, and\r\nthe latter thanked him and told him if he found need of his help\r\nhe would let him know.  On one occasion during the campaign Lincoln\r\nwas walking along one side of the street when he saw Treat on the\r\nfarther side, proceeding in the opposite direction, toward his\r\nhome.  Lincoln called out to him:  \"Judge, I won't need your help.\r\nI have got the better of the old Methodist preacher, and I will\r\nbeat him; so I will not have to call upon you for help.\"  This so\r\nembarrassed the judge, lest some one should hear what was being\r\nsaid, that he almost ran, in his hurry to get into his house.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that some of Peter Cartwright's grandchildren were\r\nsomewhat reckless boys, and one of them killed another young man.\r\nMr. Peyton Harrison, the father of the slayer, was a friend of Mr.\r\nLincoln and also of Judge Logan, and had grown to be a good friend\r\nof mine, I being a young lawyer.  The two and I were employed in\r\nthe defence of the young man.  I did the running about, and other\r\nthings necessary to be done until the time arrived for the trial.\r\nI had the accused man in my house part of the intervening time.\r\nWhen the Circuit Court convened he, having been previously indicted,\r\nwas delivered up and the trial came on.  It lasted some ten or\r\ntwelve days.  In the meantime, Peter Cartwright, and his daughter\r\nMrs. Harrison, the mother of the young man on trial, were at my\r\nhouse most of the time.  They drove into town from where they lived,\r\nsome ten or twelve miles out, every day, and remained until nearly\r\nnight, going back and forth as long as the trial lasted.  Cartwright\r\nbecame somewhat attached to me on account of my efforts in the\r\nyoung man's behalf.\r\n\r\nThe trial resulted in the acquittal of young Harrison, in whose\r\nbehalf Mr. Lincoln and Judge Logan exerted themselves very\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\nSpringfield seems changed to me since my old friend, David T.\r\nLittler, passed away.  If I visited Springfield during the heat of\r\nSummer, when every one else was gone, I was always sure that Dave\r\nLittler would be there to greet me.  Littler was a unique character.\r\nHis manners and speech were bluff and frank; he never was afraid\r\nof any one, and never was afraid to speak just exactly what he\r\nthought.  Senator Littler, Colonel Bluford Wilson, a particularly\r\ndevoted friend, and I travelled through Europe together, and we\r\nhad a great time.\r\n\r\nLittler was for many years a member of the State Senate of Illinois,\r\nand was a very useful member in securing favors for his district;\r\nand there is no district in the State more dependent upon the\r\nLegislature than the Springfield district.  He was very ambitious,\r\nand when many of my friends in Illinois believed that President\r\nMcKinley would honor me with an appointment to his cabinet, he\r\nthought he was pretty sure to succeed me in the United States\r\nSenate.  My secret opinion was that the politicians who were running\r\nState affairs at that time were fooling him; but it never came to\r\na test, as I did not enter the cabinet.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to record that I was able to show a substantial\r\ntoken of friendship when, through my influence, Senator Littler\r\nwas appointed by President Cleveland one of the Pacific Railroad\r\nCommissioners.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Colonel Littler reminds me of our mutual friend, Mr.\r\nRheuna Lawrence, an estimable citizen of Springfield in his day.\r\nWhen I was re-elected to the Senate in the Winter of 1901, Rheuna\r\nLawrence and David Littler were both desperately ill.  I visited\r\nthem both before leaving for Washington.  Lawrence died soon after,\r\nbut Littler recovered and lived for a year or two.\r\n\r\nRheuna Lawrence was intensely interested in my campaign in 1900.\r\nHe attended the Peoria convention as one of the Springfield delegates.\r\nThere was a contesting delegation from Sangamon County, and my\r\nfriends, among whom were Lawrence and Littler, were seated.  My\r\nfriends won out all along the line, and the excitement was too much\r\nfor Rheuna, who was not a drinking man at all; but he and Dave got\r\nin their cups, and it was very amusing to those who knew Mr. Lawrence\r\nas one of the cleanest and most estimable of our citizens to hear\r\nLittler refer to him as \"my drunken friend, Rheuna.\"  All of which,\r\nof course, was only a little pleasantry which I repeat for the\r\nbenefit of those who attended that convention, and knew Lawrence\r\nand Littler well.\r\n\r\nJames C. Conkling was a prominent lawyer at home, in the days of\r\nLincoln.  He was a zealous Republican and a stanch supporter of\r\nLincoln; also a lawyer and a business man; but for some reason or\r\nother, I do not know why, he became involved and failed, and the\r\npeople, especially the older citizens, insisted that he be appointed\r\npostmaster.  I recommended him, and the appointment was made.  He\r\nserved a term and passed away.  His son, Mr. Clinton Conkling, is\r\nnow one of the leading attorneys of the city.\r\n\r\nHenry Green was noted as a great lawyer.  He came to Illinois from\r\nCanada and studied law in Clinton County with the Hon. Lawrence\r\nWeldon, who was a prominent lawyer himself, and for years served\r\nas a member of the Court of Claims at Washington.  Weldon was a\r\nlovable character.  Green was for some years the partner of Milton\r\nHay, the firm being Hay, Green, and Littler; it changed later to\r\nGreen and Humphrey.  While I always believed that Hay was the best\r\nlawyer in the State, many lawyers believed that Green was the ablest\r\nin connection with railroad litigation.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. O. H. Browning was one of the most prominent men of Illinois\r\nin the early times, and was about Springfield, the capital, a great\r\ndeal, attending the Federal Court, and also the Supreme Court of\r\nthe State.  Browning, Archibald Williams, and Jack Grimshaw were\r\nall three very excellent lawyers, quite prominent in their profession,\r\nas well as associates in the Whig party.  Browning was probably\r\nthe most prominent of the three.  He was appointed by Governor\r\nYates to succeed Douglas, after the death of the latter, in the\r\nUnited States Senate.  Of course he did not remain there long,\r\nbeing succeeded, I think, by William A. Richardson, a strong Democrat\r\nof Quincy, and a man of considerable ability.  After he went out\r\nof the Senate, Browning was appointed by Andrew Johnson as Secretary\r\nof the Interior.  He became a follower of Mr. Johnson, who had\r\nbroken with the Republican party, and when he got out of office,\r\nI think he ceased to take any part in politics.  He had been talked\r\nabout a good deal at one time as the proper man for the Supreme\r\nbench, but as between him and Logan and Davis, Mr. Lincoln decided\r\nin favor of Davis.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to mention all the many friends and supporters\r\nloyal and devoted to me who are now living, but I shall be pardoned,\r\nI am sure, for saying a few words in reference to some of them at\r\npresent in Springfield, who are especially esteemed.\r\n\r\nI have been away from Springfield most of the time for nearly thirty\r\nyears, and as I go back there during the vacations for brief periods,\r\nI feel lonely, because so many of the familiar faces of earlier\r\ndays have passed away.  As I walk the streets now it seems that I\r\nknow comparatively few people; but I have the best of reasons for\r\nknowing that among them are many splendid men.\r\n\r\nI like to feel, on the eve of visiting Springfield, that I shall\r\nsee my friend, Judge J. Otis Humphrey, United States District Judge\r\nfor the Southern District of Illinois.  I have all the affection\r\nand interest in Judge Humphrey that one could entertain for a\r\nbrother, and I know that he has the same feeling for me.  He is an\r\nable man, and is regarded by the Bar as the ablest judge who has\r\never occupied the United States District Bench at Springfield.  I\r\nhave known him from his boyhood, and knew his father before him.\r\nIt was one of the great pleasures of my public career to have been\r\nable to secure from the late President McKinley his appointment as\r\nUnited States Attorney for the Southern District of Illinois, and\r\nlater to have secured his promotion to the position of United States\r\nDistrict Judge.  He is now the senior United States District Judge\r\nof the seventh circuit, and I regard him as the ablest judge of\r\nthem all.  I sincerely hope that higher honors, which he so well\r\ndeserves in his chosen career, are still in store for him.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Judge Humphrey I am reminded of the late Judge\r\nSolomon H. Bethea, who was appointed United States Attorney for\r\nthe Northern District of Illinois, and who was later promoted to\r\nthe Federal Bench.  Humphrey and Bethea I have always regarded as\r\nmy two judges, as they were both appointed on my recommendation.\r\nBethea was a man of very strong and positive character.  These\r\ntraits were so conspicuous that his manners were, by some, regarded\r\nas extremely dictatorial.  He was highly educated, a student all\r\nhis life, and a very cultivated man.  At the same time he was a\r\nfirst-rate politician.  I do not know of two more useful men to\r\nlead a floor fight in a convention than Bethea and Humphrey.  Judge\r\nBethea was my friend and supporter from the time I was elected to\r\nthe United States Senate, in 1883, until his death.  He made a\r\nsplendid record as United States Attorney, and am informed that\r\nduring his incumbency of that office, he never lost a case before\r\na jury.  Very unfortunately, just when he reached the goal of his\r\nhighest ambition, a Federal judgeship, his health failed.  I have\r\nnever for a moment doubted that had he lived and retained his health\r\nhe would have made an enviable record on the bench.\r\n\r\nThere is no better man in Springfield than John W. Bunn.  He has\r\nbeen my friend ever since I first went to Springfield.  He was a\r\nfriend of Lincoln, and there was no one in Springfield in whom\r\nLincoln placed more confidence.  I believe that one of the first\r\nappointments he made, after entering the office of President, was\r\nthat of John W. Bunn as Pension Agent at Springfield.  He was the\r\ntrusted friend of the War Governor, Yates, and performed many\r\nimportant duties for him during the Civil War.  From those early\r\ndays down to the present, every one has had confidence in John W.\r\nBunn and in his integrity and honesty.  I am glad to say that he\r\nis still living as one of the foremost citizens of his city.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. James A. Connelly, who for two terms represented the\r\ndistrict in Congress, was a very influential and popular member of\r\nCongress; and being a good lawyer he was a prominent member of the\r\nJudiciary Committee of the House.  He is a forcible speaker, and\r\nhas always taken an active part in behalf of the party in campaigns\r\nin the State.\r\n\r\nMr. E. F. Leonard--Frank Leonard, as he was familiarly known among\r\nhis friends--was my secretary when I was Governor of Illinois.  He\r\nwas later president of the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad,\r\nstationed at Peoria, and I have always believed him to be one of\r\nthe best railroad presidents in the State.  He was particularly\r\nnoted for his sound common sense and as a scholarly, well posted\r\nman in public affairs.  I do not think he ever said or did a foolish\r\nthing in his life.  He has retired from business, and lives quietly\r\nand elegantly, being a man of wealth, at the beautiful little\r\ncollege town of Amherst, Massachusetts, in the vicinity of which\r\nhe was born.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest men in Springfield is Edward Thayer.  He has been\r\na merchant in that town ever since I first went there, and was\r\nengaged in business some years before that, I believe.  His father\r\nwas living when I first went to Springfield, and was a very refined,\r\ncultivated, elegant Eastern gentleman.  Mr. Thayer, although over\r\nninety-five, still seems to enjoy the best of health, and attends\r\nhis store every day.\r\n\r\nThe present Governor of Illinois, the Hon. Charles S. Deneen,\r\nalthough a citizen of Chicago, has lived in Springfield for nearly\r\nsix years, during his incumbency of office.  Governor Deneen has\r\nhad a very successful public career.  He has creditably filled\r\nevery public office which he has held.  I have been interested in\r\nhim, not only on his own account, but on account of his father,\r\nwhom I knew well and whom I respected highly.  Years ago I obtained\r\nhis appointment in the consular service, in which he served during\r\nthe Harrison administration.  Governor Deneen has taken a prominent\r\npart in public affairs in Cook County and has held several responsible\r\npositions there.  He made a splendid State's Attorney of Cook\r\nCounty.  His honor and integrity were above suspicion.  His record\r\nas State's Attorney paved the way to the higher office of Governor\r\nof Illinois.  He is a conservative man, and has given the State a\r\nconservative administration.  Unfortunately he has had difficulties\r\nwith the Legislature, but on the whole I regard his administration\r\nas a successful and creditable one.  Governor Deneen and I are the\r\nonly two men in the history of the State who have been honored by\r\nits people by being re-elected to succeed themselves as Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nNOMINATION OF LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS FOR THE PRESIDENCY\r\n1859 and 1860\r\n\r\nReturning to the period preceding the Civil War, we observe that\r\nthe whole nation was stirred by the conduct of a man whom most people\r\nbelieved to be crazy, but who in my judgment was not.  He was an\r\nenthusiast, fired by an abnormal zeal, perhaps; but he filled a\r\nmost important place in the development leading to the Civil War.\r\nI refer to old John Brown.\r\n\r\nWith a score of followers he seized the arsenal at Harpers Ferry\r\nin October, 1859.  The nation was then on the very verge of civil\r\nwar.  There was tremendous excitement even in far-off Springfield\r\nwhen the news came over the wires that John Brown had opened war\r\nalmost single-handed and alone.  Under orders from General-in-Chief\r\nWinfield Scott, Colonel Robert E. Lee with a battalion of soldiers\r\nmarched on Harpers Ferry, and, after a series of siege operations,\r\nsummoned John Brown to surrender, the demand being borne to the\r\nbesieged by J. E. B. Stuart, a young lieutenant, afterwards\r\ndistinguished as the foremost cavalry leader of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThe story of John Brown is too familiar to be repeated here; but\r\nhow strange that in so short a time his captor, Robert E. Lee,\r\nshould become famous as one of the greatest leaders of force in\r\nrebellion against the government he then served.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown was captured and hanged.  He had but few sympathizers\r\nin the North, but his attempt to incite the slaves to rebellion\r\ngreatly stirred up the entire South, and hastened secession.\r\n\r\nVery soon the second National Republican Convention was held at\r\nChicago.  At this convention, which nominated Lincoln for the\r\nPresidency, the resolutions declared for \"the maintenance inviolate\r\nof the right of each State to order and control its own domestic\r\ninstitutions according to its own judgment exclusively,\" and\r\ncondemned the attempt to enforce the extreme pretensions of a purely\r\nlocal interest (meaning the slave interest), through the intervention\r\nof Congress and the courts, by the Democratic administration.  They\r\nderided the new dogma that the Constitution of its own force carried\r\nslavery into the Territories, and denied the authority of Congress,\r\nor of a Territorial Legislature, or of any individual to give leave\r\nof existence to slavery in any Territory of the United States.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the efforts to make of Kansas a Slave State,\r\nit had become plain that the South could not hope to keep its\r\nequality of representation in the Senate without reversing what\r\nappeared to be settled popular opinion concerning the status of\r\nthe Northern Territories.  Resolutions to this general effect were\r\nmoved by Jefferson Davis early in February, 1860, and passed by\r\nthe Senate.  It was in effect the ultimatum presented to the\r\nDemocratic party at its National Convention when it assembled,\r\nApril 23, at Charleston, S. C.  The warring factions failed to come\r\nto an agreement, and the convention adjourned to meet at Baltimore\r\non the eighteenth of June.  There Douglas was at last nominated.\r\nThe delegates who had seceded at Charleston were joined by other\r\nseceders at Baltimore, and nominated John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky\r\nfor President.  A month later, May 19, a third faction, calling\r\nitself the \"Constitutional Union Party,\" assembled in convention\r\nat the same city, Baltimore, and nominated John Bell of Tennessee\r\nand Edward Everett of Massachusetts, on a platform whose distinguishing\r\nbattle-cry was \"The Constitution, the Union of the States, and the\r\nenforcement of the laws.\"  Three days before this, May sixteenth,\r\nthe Republican Convention had met at Chicago, and had nominated\r\nLincoln and Hamlin on a platform which rang true on great principles\r\nand with high resolve.\r\n\r\nIn many particulars this platform was a contrast to, rather than\r\na growth from, that of 1856.  It asserted that the normal condition\r\nof all the territory of the United States was that of freedom; it\r\ndenounced the outrages in Kansas, and demanded her immediate\r\nadmission into the Union, with her Constitution, as a Free State;\r\nit branded the re-opening of the African slave-trade as a crime;\r\nand in expressing the abhorrence of the Republican party to all\r\nschemes of disunion, the Democratic party was arraigned for its\r\nsilence in the presence of threats of secession made by its own\r\nmembers.  The doctrine of encouragement to domestic industry was\r\nannounced; the sale of the public lands was condemned; the coming\r\nmeasure of securing homesteads for the landless was approved; and\r\na pledge of protection was given to all citizens, whether native\r\nor naturalized, and whether at home or abroad.  The party was again\r\npledged to the construction of a railway to the Pacific Ocean, and\r\nto the improvement of the rivers and harbors of the country.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years preceding, the home State of Lincoln and\r\nDouglas had decreased its public debt $3,104,374.  She had become\r\nthe fourth State of the Union in population and wealth, having\r\nduring the decade then closing outstripped Virginia, Massachusetts,\r\nNorth Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Indiana.  In production of\r\nwheat and corn she now surpassed all other States and occupied the\r\nforemost position.  She had in successful operation two thousand,\r\nnine hundred miles of railways, being surpassed in this respect by\r\nOhio only.  Chicago, her marvellous lake mart, had grown from a\r\npopulation of 29,963 to 109,206, an increase of nearly three\r\nhundred per cent.  From nine Congressmen in 1850, she was entitled\r\nin 1860 to thirteen; and so, on every hand, might the recital of\r\nher growth be continued indefinitely.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in twenty years, during the progress of a\r\npolitical campaign in Illinois, the voice of Lincoln was not heard.\r\nBut the record of his former speeches, printed by an enterprising\r\nOhio publishing firm, in a volume which sold in enormous numbers,\r\nafforded the text from which the Republican stump-orators in every\r\nFree State gathered at once their logic and their inspiration.\r\nThough the orator himself remained silent, the potent echo of his\r\neloquence resounded in countless voices from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nThe political contest that followed the various nominations was a\r\nmemorable one.  Douglas made his last effort for the Presidency\r\nwith wonderful vigor and spirit.  He canvassed the whole country,\r\nand great throngs were greatly moved by his eloquent and energetic\r\noratory.  Jefferson Davis and other Southern orators canvassed\r\nportions of the Northern States in support of the nominee of the\r\nSouthern wing of the Democratic party.  In some parts of the North\r\nfusions were attempted among the opponents of the Republican\r\ncandidate.  In the South the interest in the contest was even more\r\nintense than in the North.  Douglas had a good following in many\r\nportions of the South, but a majority of the ruling class there,\r\nwhether they had formerly been Democrats or Whigs, were now disposed\r\nto bring the long sectional controversy to an issue.  Therefore,\r\nbesides the debate over the Presidential issue, there was a serious\r\ndiscussion also of what course the South should take in the event\r\nof Mr. Lincoln's election.  In all the Cotton States the sentiment\r\nfor secession was now very strong.  The Alabama Legislature, early\r\nin 1860, had instructed her Governor to call a convention in case\r\na \"Black Republican\" should be elected President in November.\r\nSouth Carolina had long been ready to join in such a movement, or\r\nto lead in it.\r\n\r\nAt last, election day came, and the results, immediate as well as\r\nulterior, are deserving of some remark.  The aggregate popular vote\r\nexceeded four million, six hundred and eighty thousand; and of the\r\ntotal, one million, eight hundred and sixty-six thousand votes were\r\ngiven for Mr. Lincoln; and of the three hundred and three electoral\r\nvotes, he received one hundred and eighty.  Mr. Breckinridge, the\r\ncandidate of the South, received eight hundred and forty-seven\r\nthousand votes, and seventy-two votes in the Electoral College;\r\nwhile Mr. Douglas received only twelve electoral votes, although\r\nhis popular vote reached a million, three hundred and seventy-five\r\nthousand.  Bell received thirty-nine electoral votes on a popular\r\nvote of less than six hundred thousand.  Thus the popular vote for\r\nMr. Lincoln was nearly a half-million less than a majority; but\r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Buchanan, was also a minority President, so\r\nthat this fact as a pretext for secession was wholly without point.\r\n\r\nEleven States voted for Mr. Breckinridge, including Delaware and\r\nMaryland; and eleven States became members of the Confederacy,\r\nincluding Virginia and Tennessee, which had voted for Mr. Bell.\r\nIt all went to show that the Democratic party as represented by\r\nBreckinridge was in fact a secession party first of all.  The\r\ndivision of the Democratic party decided the election in favor of\r\nMr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nHad that party supported Mr. Douglas in good faith, his election\r\nwould probably have been secured; but the South would have been\r\nleft without excuse had it persisted in the scheme of secession.\r\n\r\nTherefore it came to pass that the Democratic party was disorganized\r\nby its own leaders of the South as a step preliminary to the election\r\nof Mr. Lincoln, and the making of that election a pretext for\r\ndisunion.  This part of the conspiracy was managed with consummate\r\nskill and eminent success; but the conspirators were perfectly well\r\naware that ultimate success depended largely on prompt, effective,\r\nand decisive steps which must be taken while their efficient friend\r\nin the Executive Mansion still remained in office.\r\n\r\nThis allowed them four months of precious time between the election\r\nof Mr. Lincoln and his inauguration as President.  The vigilance\r\nand effectiveness of their work is an interesting and familiar\r\nstory, but I shall not attempt here a narration of it.  This work\r\neventuated in war, and with the opening of war, Mr. Douglas was\r\nquickly found in the attitude of a leader in the cause of the Union\r\n--the closing and the noblest episode of his whole remarkable\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nI knew Senator Douglas quite well.  Of course, he was considerably\r\nolder than I, and was one of the great men of the Nation, when I\r\nwas just starting in public life.  I knew him before the Civil War.\r\nHe was a wonderful man with the people.  I do not think there was\r\never a man in public life who was more thoroughly loved by the\r\nparty to which he belonged than Senator Douglas.  His adherents\r\nwere devoted to him at all times and under all circumstances.  When\r\nhe came through the State, the whole Democratic party was alive\r\nand ready to rally to his support.  I heard him deliver addresses\r\non two occasions before the War.  I heard one of the Lincoln-Douglas\r\ndebates at Ottawa.  I heard Lincoln deliver the famous Springfield\r\naddress, in which he uttered the immortal sentiment, \"A house\r\ndivided against itself cannot stand.\"  To this address Douglas\r\nafterwards replied.  When Lincoln was inaugurated, Douglas was\r\npresent on the platform and held Lincoln's hat while he delivered\r\nhis inaugural address; the tremendous significance of which trivial\r\nact can be appreciated only in the light of later years.\r\n\r\nBut Douglas did not hesitate for a moment after Fort Sumter was\r\nfired upon, April 12, 1861.  He voluntarily called upon President\r\nLincoln and tendered his support to the cause of the Union, and\r\nimmediately gave out to the Associated Press a statement, calling\r\nupon the people of the North, regardless of party, to rally to its\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nI believe it was Mr. Lincoln who asked him to visit Illinois, where,\r\nespecially in the southern part of the State, there was considerable\r\ndisunion sentiment.  There was a great effort to induce the region\r\nwhere the Democracy predominated, the people being loyal followers\r\nof Douglas, to go with the South instead of the North.  Douglas\r\nalone could save it.  He came to Illinois, as he told me, partly on\r\nthat account; to rally the State to the support of the Union,\r\nearnestly desiring that the country should understand where he\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nHe visited Springfield while the Legislature was in session.\r\nSenator Douglas was invited to address a joint session of that\r\nbody, which he did on the evening of April 25, 1861.  Being Speaker\r\nof the House, I presided.  In addition to the members of the\r\nLegislature, there was a great crowd present.\r\n\r\nI have a vivid recollection of the evening.  Prior to that time I\r\nhad not believed in Senator Douglas; which was only natural, I\r\nhaving been a Whig and an enthusiastic adherent of Lincoln.  The\r\nduty of introducing Senator Douglas to the joint Assembly devolved\r\nupon myself; I cannot at this late day recall the words I used,\r\nbut I am sure that I presented him in as complimentary a manner as\r\nmy prejudices allowed.\r\n\r\nAs he continued speaking, however, I, as thousands--nay, millions\r\n--of others had done, succumbed to the magic of his eloquence and\r\nthe irresistible logic of his brilliant mind; and I must here\r\nconfess that never before or since have I heard a more masterful,\r\na more inspired, plea for the integrity of the Union and the\r\nindivisibility of the Nation than Senator Douglas delivered upon\r\nthat occasion.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me, as he hurled the thunders of his eloquence broadcast,\r\nthat the very rafters rang in harmony, that the air vibrated in\r\naccord with his denunciations of rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe address was not a long one.  As it was printed by order of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, I shall take the liberty of presenting it in full:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\nI am not insensible to the patriotic motives which have prompted\r\nyou to do me the honor to invite me to address you on the momentous\r\nissues now presented in the condition of our country.  With a heart\r\nfilled with sadness and grief, I proceed to comply with your\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\"For the first time since the adoption of the Federal Constitution,\r\na widespread conspiracy exists to destroy the best government the\r\nsun of heaven ever shed its rays upon.  Hostile armies are now\r\nmarching upon the Federal Capitol, with a view of planting a\r\nrevolutionary flag upon its dome; seizing the National archives;\r\ntaking captive the President elected by the votes of the people,\r\nand holding him in the hands of secessionists and disunionists.\r\nA war of aggression and of extermination is being waged against\r\nthe Government established by our fathers.  The boast has gone\r\nforth by the authorities of this revolutionary Government that on\r\nthe first day of May the revolutionary flag shall float from the\r\nwalls of the Capitol at Washington, and that on the fourth day of\r\nJuly the Rebel army shall hold possession of the Hall of Independence\r\nin Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\"The simple question presented to us is, whether we will wait for\r\nthe enemy to carry out his boast of making war upon our soil; or\r\nwhether we will rush as one man to the defence of the Government\r\nand its capital, and defend it from the hands of all assailants\r\nwho have threatened to destroy it.  Already the piratical flag has\r\nbeen unfurled against the commerce of the United States.  Letters\r\nof marque have been issued, appealing to the pirates of the world\r\nto assemble under that revolutionary flag and commit depredations\r\non the commerce carried on under the Stars and Stripes.  The\r\nnavigation of our great river into the Gulf of Mexico is obstructed.\r\nHostile batteries have been planted upon its banks; custom houses\r\nhave already been established; and we are now required to pay\r\ntribute and taxes, without having a voice in making the laws imposing\r\nthem, or having a share in the proceeds after they have been\r\ncollected.  The question is, whether this war of aggression shall\r\nproceed, and we remain with folded arms, inattentive spectators;\r\nor whether we shall meet the aggressors at the threshold and turn\r\nback the tide of revolution and usurpation.\r\n\r\n\"So long as there was a hope of peaceful solution, I prayed and\r\nimplored for compromise.  I can appeal to my countrymen with\r\nconfidence that I have spared no effort, omitted no opportunity,\r\nto secure a peaceful solution of all these troubles, and thus\r\nrestore peace, happiness, and fraternity to the country.  When all\r\npropositions of peace fail, and a war of aggression is proclaimed,\r\nthere is but one course left for the patriot, and that is to rally\r\nunder that flag which has waved over the capitol from the days of\r\nWashington, and around the Government established by Washington,\r\nMadison, Hamilton, and their compeers.\r\n\r\n\"What is the alleged cause for this invasion of the rights and\r\nauthority of the Government of the United States?  The cause alleged\r\nis that the institutions of the Southern States are not safe under\r\nthe Federal Government.  What evidence has been presented that they\r\nare insecure?  I appeal to every man within the sound of my voice\r\nto tell me at what period from the time that Washington was\r\ninaugurated down to this hour, have the rights of the Southern\r\nStates--the rights of the slave-holders--been more secure than they\r\nare at this moment?  When in the whole history of this Government\r\nhave they stood on so firm a basis?  For the first time in the\r\nhistory of this republic, there is no restriction by act of Congress\r\nupon the institution of slavery, anywhere within the limits of the\r\nUnited States.  Then it cannot be the Territorial question that\r\nhas given them cause for rebellion.  When was the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw executed with more fidelity than since the inauguration of the\r\npresent incumbent of the Presidential office?  Let the people of\r\nChicago speak and tell us when were the laws of the land executed\r\nwith as much firmness and fidelity, so far as the fugitive slaves\r\nare concerned, as they are now.  Can any man tell me of any one\r\nact of aggression that has been committed or attempted since the\r\nlast Presidential election, that justifies this violent disruption\r\nof the Federal Union?\r\n\r\n\"I ask you to reflect, and then point out any one act that has been\r\ndone--any one duty that has been omitted to be done--of which any\r\none of these disunionists can justly complain.  Yet we are told,\r\nsimply because a certain political party has succeed in a Presidential\r\nelection, they choose to consider that their liberties are not\r\nsafe, and therefore they are justified in breaking up the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\"I had supposed that it was a cardinal and fundamental principle\r\nof our system of government that the decision of the people at the\r\nballot box, without fraud, according to the forms of the Constitution,\r\nwas to command the implicit obedience of every good citizen.  If\r\ndefeat at a Presidential election is to justify the minority, or\r\nany portion of the minority, in raising the traitorous hand of\r\nrebellion against the constituted authorities, you will find the\r\nfuture history of the United States written in the history of\r\nMexico.  According to my reading of Mexican history, there has\r\nnever been one presidential term, from the time of the Revolution\r\nof 1820 down to this day, when the candidate elected by the people\r\never served his four years.  In every instance, either the defeated\r\ncandidate has seized upon the Presidential chair by use of the\r\nbayonet, or he has turned out the duly elected President before\r\nhis term expired.  Are we to inaugurate this Mexican system in the\r\nUnited States of America?  Suppose the case to be reversed.  Suppose\r\nthe disunion candidate had been elected by any means--I care not\r\nwhat, if by any means in accordance with the forms of the Constitution\r\n--at the last Presidential election; then, suppose the Republicans\r\nhad raised a rebellion against his authority--in that case you would have\r\nfound me tendering my best efforts and energies to John C. Breckinridge\r\nto put down the Republican rebels.  And if you had attempted such\r\na rebellion I would have justified him in calling forth all the\r\npower and energies of this country to have crushed you out.\r\n\r\n\"The first duty of an American citizen, or of a citizen of any\r\nconstitutional Government, is obedience to the Constitution and\r\nlaws of his country.  I have no apprehension that any man in\r\nIllinois, or beyond the limits of our own beloved State, will\r\nmisconstrue or misunderstand my motive.  So far as any of the\r\npartisan questions are concerned, I stand in equal, irreconcilable,\r\nand undying opposition both to the Republicans and the secessionists.\r\nYou all know that I am a very good partisan fighter in partisan\r\ntimes, and I trust you will find me equally as good a patriot when\r\nthe country is in danger.\r\n\r\n\"Now permit me to say to the assembled Representatives and Senators\r\nof our beloved States, composed of men of both political parties,\r\nin my opinion it is your duty to lay aside, for the time being,\r\nyour party creeds and party platforms; to dispense with your party\r\norganizations and partisan appeals; to forget that you were ever\r\ndivided, until you have rescued the Government and the country from\r\ntheir assailants.  When this paramount duty shall have been performed,\r\nit will be proper for each of us to resume our respective political\r\npositions according to our convictions of public duty.  Give me a\r\ncountry first, that my children may live in peace; then we will\r\nhave a theatre for our party organizations to operate upon.\r\n\r\n\"Are we to be called upon to fold our arms, allow the national\r\ncapital to be seized by a military force under a foreign revolutionary\r\nflag; to see the archives of the Government in the hands of a people\r\nwho affect to despise the flag and Government of the United States?\r\nI am not willing to be expelled by military force, nor to fly from\r\nthe Federal capitol.  It has been my daily avocation six months in\r\nthe year, for eighteen years, to walk into that marble building,\r\nand from its portico to survey a prosperous, happy, and united\r\ncountry on both sides of the Potomac.  I believe I may with confidence\r\nappeal to the people of every section of the country to bear\r\ntestimony that I have been as thoroughly national in my political\r\nopinions and actions as any man that has lived in my day.  And I\r\nbelieve if I should make an appeal to the people of the State of\r\nIllinois, or of the Northern States, for their impartial verdict,\r\nthey would say that whatever errors I have committed have been in\r\nleaning too far to the Southern section of the Union against my\r\nown.  I think I can appeal to friend and foe--I use the term in a\r\npolitical sense, and I trust I use the word _foe_ in a past sense\r\n--I can appeal to them with confidence, that I have never pandered\r\nto the prejudice or passion of my section against the minority\r\nsection of this Union; and I will say to you now, with all frankness\r\nand in all sincerity, that I will never sanction nor acquiesce in\r\nany warfare whatever upon the constitutional rights or domestic\r\ninstitutions of the people of the Southern States.  On the contrary,\r\nif there was an attempt to invade these rights--to stir up servile\r\ninsurrection among their people--I would rush to their rescue, and\r\ninterpose with whatever of strength I might possess to defend them\r\nfrom such a calamity.  While I will never invade them--while I will\r\nnever fail to defend and protect their rights to the full extent\r\nthat a fair and liberal construction of the Constitution can give\r\nthem--they must distinctly understand that I will never acquiesce\r\nin their invasion of our constitutional rights.\r\n\r\n\"It is a crime against the inalienable and indefeasible rights of\r\nevery American citizen to attempt to destroy the Government under\r\nwhich we were born.  It is a crime against constitutional freedom\r\nand the hopes of the friends of freedom throughout the wide world\r\nto attempt to blot out the United States from the map of Christendom.\r\nYet this attempt is now being made.  The Government of our fathers\r\nis to be overthrown and destroyed.  The capital that bears the name\r\nof the Father of his Country is to be bombarded and levelled with\r\nthe earth among the rubbish and the dust of things that are past.\r\nThe records of your Government are to be scattered to the four\r\nwinds of heaven.  The constituted authorities, placed there by the\r\nsame high authority that placed Washington and Jefferson and Madison\r\nand Jackson in the chair, are to be captured and carried off, to\r\nbecome a byword and a scorn to the nations of the world.\r\n\r\n\"You may think that I am drawing a picture that is overwrought.\r\nNo man who has spent the last week in the city of Washington will\r\nbelieve that I have done justice to it.  You have all the elements\r\nof the French Revolution surrounding the capital now, and threatening\r\nit with its terrors.  Not only is our constitutional Government to\r\nbe stricken down; not only is our flag to be blotted out; but the\r\nvery foundations of social order are to be undermined and destroyed;\r\nthe demon of destruction is to be let loose over the face of the\r\nland, a reign of terror and mob law is to prevail in each section\r\nof the Union, and the man who dares to plead for the cause of\r\njustice and moderation in either section is to be marked down as\r\na traitor to his section.  If this state of things is allowed to\r\ngo on, how long before you will have the guillotine in active\r\noperation?\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to you, my countrymen--men of all parties--not to allow\r\nyour passions to get the better of your judgment.  Do not allow\r\nyour vengeance upon the authors of this great iniquity to lead you\r\ninto rash, and cruel, and desperate acts upon loyal citizens who\r\nmay differ with you in opinion.  Let the spirit of moderation and\r\nof justice prevail.  You cannot expect, within so few weeks after\r\nan excited political canvass, that every man can rise to the high\r\nand patriotic level of forgetting his partisan prejudices and\r\nsacrifice everything upon the altar of his country; but allow me\r\nto say to you, whom I have opposed and warred against with an energy\r\nyou will respect--allow me to say to you, you will not be true to\r\nyour country if you ever attempt to manufacture partisan capital\r\nout of the misfortunes of your country.  When calling upon Democrats\r\nto rally to the tented field, leaving wife, child, father, and\r\nmother behind them to rush to the rescue of the President that you\r\nelected, do not make war upon them and try to manufacture partisan\r\ncapital at their expense out of a struggle in which they are engaged\r\nfrom the holiest and purest of motives.\r\n\r\n\"Then I appeal to you, my own Democratic friends--those men that\r\nhave never failed to rally under the glorious banner of the country\r\nwhenever an enemy at home or abroad has dared to assail it--to you\r\nwith whom it has always been my pride to act--do not allow the\r\nmortification, growing out of a defeat in a partisan struggle, and\r\nthe elevation of a party to power that we firmly believe to be\r\ndangerous to the country--do not let that convert you from patriots\r\ninto traitors to your native land.  Whenever our Government is\r\nassailed, when hostile armies are marching under new and odious\r\nbanners against the Government of our country, the shortest way to\r\npeace is the most stupendous and unanimous preparations for war.\r\nThe greater unanimity, the less blood will be shed.  The more prompt\r\nand energetic the movement, and the more imposing in numbers, the\r\nshorter will be the struggle.\r\n\r\n\"Every friend of freedom--every champion and advocate of constitutional\r\nliberty throughout the land--must feel that this cause is his own.\r\nThere is and should be nothing disagreeable or humiliating to men\r\nwho have differed in times of peace on every question that could\r\ndivide fellow men, to rally in concert in defence of the country\r\nand against all assailants.  While all the States of this Union,\r\nand every citizen of every State has a priceless legacy dependent\r\nupon the success of our efforts to maintain this Government, we in\r\nthe great valley of the Mississippi have peculiar interests and\r\ninducements to the struggle.  What is the attempt now being made?\r\nSeven States of the Union chose to declare that they will no longer\r\nobey the Constitution of the United States; that they will withdraw\r\nfrom the Government established by our fathers; that they will\r\ndissolve without our consent the bonds that have united us together.\r\nBut, not content with that, they proceed to invade and obstruct\r\nour dearest and most inalienable rights, secured by the Constitution.\r\nOne of their first acts is to establish a battery of cannon upon\r\nthe banks of the Mississippi, on the dividing line between the\r\nStates of Mississippi and Tennessee, and require every steamer that\r\npasses down the river to come to under their guns to receive a\r\ncustom-house officer on board, to prescribe where the boat may land\r\nand upon what terms it may put out a barrel of flour or a cask of\r\nbacon.\r\n\r\n\"We are called upon to sanction this policy.  Before consenting to\r\ntheir right to commit such acts, I implore you to consider that\r\nthe same principle which will allow the cotton States to exclude\r\nus from the ports of the gulf, would authorize the New England\r\nStates and New York and Pennsylvania to exclude us from the Atlantic,\r\nand the Pacific States to exclude us from the ports of that ocean.\r\nWhenever you sanction this doctrine of secession, you authorize\r\nthe States bordering upon the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to withdraw\r\nfrom us, form alliance among themselves, and exclude us from the\r\nmarkets of the world and from communication with all the rest of\r\nChristendom.  Not only this, but there follows a tariff on imports,\r\nlevying taxes upon every pound of tea and coffee and sugar and\r\nevery yard of cloth that we may import for our consumption; the\r\nlevying too of an export duty upon every bushel of corn and every\r\npound of meat we may choose to send to the markets of the world to\r\npay for our imports.\r\n\r\n\"Bear in mind that these very cotton States, who in former times\r\nhave been so boisterous in their demands for free trade, have,\r\namong their first acts, established an export duty on cotton for\r\nthe first time in American history.\r\n\r\n\"It is an historical fact, well known to every man who has read\r\nthe debates of the convention which framed the Constitution, that\r\nthe Southern States refused to become parties to the Constitution\r\nunless there was an express provision in the Constitution prohibiting\r\nCongress to levy an export duty on any product of the country.  No\r\nsooner have these cotton States seceded than an export duty is\r\nlevied, and if they will levy it on their own cotton do you not\r\nthink they will levy it on our pork and our beef and our corn and\r\nour wheat and our manufactured articles, and all we have to sell?\r\nThen what is the proposition?  It is to enable the tier of States\r\nbordering on the Atlantic and the Pacific and on the Gulf, surrounding\r\nus on all sides, to withdraw from our Union, form alliances among\r\nthemselves, and then levy taxes on us without our consent, and\r\ncollect revenues without giving us any just proportion or any\r\nportion of the amount collected.  Can we submit to taxation without\r\nrepresentation?  Can we permit nations foreign to us to collect\r\nrevenues off our products, the fruits of our industry?  I ask the\r\ncitizens of Illinois--I ask every citizen in the great basin between\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and the Alleghenies, in the valley of the Ohio,\r\nMississippi, and Missouri to tell me whether he is willing to\r\nsanction a line of policy that may isolate us from the markets of\r\nthe world and make us dependent provinces upon powers that thus\r\nchoose to surround and hem us in?\r\n\r\n\"I warn you, my countrymen, whenever you permit this to be done in\r\nthe Southern States, New York will very soon follow their example.\r\nNew York--that great port where two-thirds of all our revenue is\r\ncollected, and whence two-thirds of our products are exported, will\r\nnot long be able to resist the temptation of taxing fifteen millions\r\nof people in the great West, when she can monopolize the resources\r\nand release her own people thereby from any taxation whatsoever.\r\nHence I say to you, my countrymen, from the best consideration I\r\nhave been able to give to this subject, after the most mature\r\nreflection and thorough investigation, I have arrived at the\r\nconclusion that, come what may,--war if it must be, although I\r\ndeplore it as a great calamity,--yet, come what may, the people of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley can never consent to be excluded from free\r\naccess to the ports of the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Gulf of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n\"Hence, I repeat, that while I am not prepared to take up arms or\r\nto sanction war upon the rights of the Southern States, upon their\r\ndomestic institutions, upon their rights of person or property,\r\nbut, on the contrary, would rush to their defence and protect them\r\nfrom assault, I will never cease to urge my countrymen to take up\r\narms and to fight to the death in defence of our indefeasible\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\"Hence, if a war does come, it will be a war of self-defence on\r\nour part.  It will be a war in defence of our own just rights; in\r\ndefence of the Government which we have inherited as a priceless\r\nlegacy from our patriotic fathers; in defence of those great rights\r\nof the freedom of trade, commerce, transit, and intercourse from\r\nthe centre to the circumference of our great continent.  These are\r\nrights we can never surrender.\r\n\r\n\"I have struggled almost against hope to avert the calamities of\r\nwar and to effect a reunion and reconciliation with our brethren\r\nof the South.  I yet hope it may be done, but I am not able to\r\npoint out to you how it may be effected.  Nothing short of Providence\r\ncan reveal to us the issue of this great struggle.  Bloody--calamitous\r\n--I fear it will be.  May we so conduct it if a collision must\r\ncome, that we will stand justified in the eyes of Him who knows\r\nour hearts and who will judge our every act.  We must not yield to\r\nresentments, nor to the spirit of vengeance, much less to the desire\r\nfor conquest or ambition.\r\n\r\n\"I see no path of ambition open in a bloody struggle for triumph\r\nover my own countrymen.  There is no path for ambition open for me\r\nin a divided country, after having so long served a united and\r\nglorious country.  Hence, whatever we may do must be the result of\r\nconviction, of patriotic duty--the duty that we owe to ourselves,\r\nto our posterity, and to the friends of constitutional liberty and\r\nself-government throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\"My friends, I can say no more.  To discuss these topics is the\r\nmost painful duty of my life.  It is with a sad heart--with a grief\r\nthat I have never before experienced, that I have to contemplate\r\nthis fearful struggle; but I believe in my conscience that it is\r\na duty we owe ourselves and our children and our God, to protect\r\nthis Government and that flag from every assailant, be he who he\r\nmay.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the members of that joint assembly who listened to the\r\neloquence of Senator Douglas that evening, forty-nine years ago,\r\naside from Dr. William Jayne of Springfield, and myself, I do not\r\nknow of a single one now living.\r\n\r\nAfter he concluded his address, the joint session of the Legislature\r\ndissolved.  He and I remained together in conversation, and I\r\naccompanied him to his hotel.  During that talk he expressed to me\r\nthe great anxiety which he felt for the safety of the country and\r\nthe preservation of the Union.  I am satisfied that it was his\r\nambition to enter the army and possibly lead it in suppressing the\r\nRebellion.  What would have been the result in that case, no one\r\ncan tell; but I am inclined to think that he would have made a very\r\ngreat general.\r\n\r\nSenator Douglas's Springfield speech had a tremendous effect on\r\npublic opinion.  It brought his followers, and they were legion in\r\nall parts of the country, to the support of the Government and the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nSenator Douglas went from Springfield to Chicago, where he delivered\r\nanother eloquent address, along the same lines as the one delivered\r\nat Springfield, to tens of thousands of people.  Very soon thereafter\r\nhe was taken ill with pneumonia and passed away.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of extraordinary intellect.  He did his full part, at\r\none of the most critical periods of our history, in saving the\r\nNation.  His speeches in and out of Congress are among the most\r\nable and eloquent delivered by any American statesman.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nSPEAKER OF THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE AND A MEMBER OF CONGRESS\r\n1860 to 1865\r\n\r\nThe election of Mr. Lincoln was made the pretext for secession.\r\nIt has always seemed to me that the South was determined to secede\r\nno matter at what cost; and it has also seemed to me that this\r\ndetermination was not due to the great body of the people of the\r\nSouth, than whom there were no better, but to the jealous politicians\r\nof that section, who saw the gradual growth in wealth and power of\r\nthe Northern States threaten their domination of the National\r\nGovernment, which they had firmly held since the days of Washington.\r\nThey saw that domination slipping away, and they determined to form\r\na nation of their own--in which slavery, indeed, would be paramount;\r\nbut it was not so much slavery as it was their own desire for\r\ncontrol that influenced them.\r\n\r\nAs soon, therefore, as Mr. Lincoln was elected President they began\r\nthe organization of a Government of their own.  President Buchanan\r\ndeclared in his message that the Southern States had no right to\r\nsecede--\"unless they wanted to,\" as some one aptly expressed it;\r\nin other words, that he had no right under the Constitution to keep\r\nthem forcibly in the Union, and thus the constitutional opinions\r\nof the President harmonized effectively with the purposes of the\r\nsecessionists.  Fortunate it was that Mr. Buchanan had so short a\r\nterm remaining after the election of Mr. Lincoln.  Had a year or\r\ntwo elapsed, the Confederacy would have been firmly and irrevocably\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIt has never been quite clear to my mind whether Mr. Buchanan cared\r\nto preserve the Union or not.  In the heat and passion of that day,\r\nwe all thought he was a traitor.  As I look back now and think of\r\nit, remembering his long and distinguished service to the country\r\nin almost every capacity--as a legislator, as a diplomat, as\r\nSecretary of State, as President, I think now he was only weak.\r\nHis term was about expiring, and he saw and feared the awful\r\nconsequences of a civil war.\r\n\r\nOne State after another seceded; the United States' arms and arsenals\r\nwere seized; on January 9, the _Star of the West_, carrying supplies\r\nto Fort Sumter, was fired upon and driven off.  South Carolina,\r\nMississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas went\r\nout.  The Confederate States of America were organized in the capital\r\nof Alabama on the fourth of February, and Jefferson Davis was\r\nelected President.\r\n\r\nWe watched with great interest the famous Peace Conference which\r\nmet in Washington and over which John Tyler, ex-President of the\r\nUnited States, presided.  It sat during the month of February,\r\npreceding Mr. Lincoln's inauguration, and recommended the adoption\r\nof seven additional articles to the Constitution, which were\r\nafterwards rejected by the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut the fourth of March finally came, and new life was infused into\r\nthe national councils.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln's speeches on his way East were a disappointment, in\r\nthat they failed in the least to abate the rising Southern storm;\r\nthe calmly firm tone of his inaugural address impressed the North,\r\nbut his appeals to the South were in vain.  Said he:\r\n\r\n\"I declare that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to\r\ninterfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it\r\nexists. . . . The Union of these States is perpetual.  It is safe\r\nto assert that no Government proper ever had a provision in its\r\norganic law for its own termination.  The power confided to me will\r\nbe used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places\r\nbelonging to the Government and to collect the duties and imposts.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a notable appeal that he made, in closing, to the\r\nSoutherners:\r\n\r\n\"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine,\r\nis the momentous issue of civil war.  The Government will not assail\r\nyou.  You can have no conflict without being yourselves the\r\naggressors.  You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the\r\nGovernment, while I shall have the most solemn one to 'preserve,\r\nprotect, and defend it.'\r\n\r\n\"I am loath to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must\r\nnot be enemies.  Though passion may have strained it must not break\r\nour bonds of affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching\r\nfrom every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and\r\nhearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of\r\nthe union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better\r\nangels of our nature.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Mr. Lincoln was first elected President of\r\nthe United States, I was for the second time elected to the\r\nLegislature of Illinois.  I received the vote of what they called\r\nthe Republicans, or Free-soil men, and of those who were previously\r\nknown as Fillmore men.  I was always in thorough accord with Mr.\r\nLincoln in political sentiment, though I had supported Fillmore\r\nrather than Fremont in 1856.  I most heartily supported Lincoln's\r\ncandidacy, and as candidate for the Legislature received more votes\r\nthan Mr. Lincoln received in Sangamon County.  Douglas carried the\r\ncounty as against Lincoln, and I carried it as against my opponent.\r\nThere was great enthusiasm for Mr. Lincoln in the county, but he\r\nwas so positive and outspoken in his convictions on the slavery\r\nquestion that he failed to get a considerable number of votes; many\r\nwent to other Republicans who did not express their views so\r\nvigorously as he did.  Of course, what he lost at home because of\r\nzeal and earnestness in his cause, was more than made up to him on\r\nthe wider field covered by his candidacy.\r\n\r\nStephen A. Hurlbut was a member of that Legislature, and afterward\r\nbecame a prominent general in the army.  I might say that General\r\nHurlbut and Lawrence Church were two very strong men, both from\r\nthe northern part of the State, and both became prominent in the\r\npublic service.  I might say also that but for these two men, who\r\nput me forward as a candidate for the Speakership, I probably would\r\nnot have become a candidate.  On the Saturday night before the\r\nMonday on which the Legislature was to convene, they pressed me so\r\nstrongly that I consented, and became the nominee of my party\r\nassociates.  J. W. Singleton was the Democratic nominee.  Before\r\nthe Legislature convened, and during the intervening Sunday, a\r\nfeeling got abroad among the older members of the Legislature that\r\nI was too young to be trusted in such a responsible position as\r\nthat of Speaker.  When I came down-town on Sunday I found that\r\nfeeling prevailing.\r\n\r\nI at once took notice of it, and stated that if there was any\r\nfeeling that I had done wrong in becoming a candidate, I would\r\nsubmit the question to another test of the sense of the Republicans\r\nin the Legislature, and if they thought I ought not to have the\r\nposition I would cheerfully yield to their judgment.  The caucus\r\nwas called together Monday morning, and I stated that I had heard\r\nthat there was some dissatisfaction, and I desired to have another\r\nvote.  A vote was accordingly taken, and I was again nominated,\r\nand by a larger vote then in the first instance; whereupon the older\r\nmen gave in, and I was duly elected, receiving thirty-nine votes\r\nto twenty-nine cast for the Democratic candidate.\r\n\r\nI think I made more friends, in the conduct of the office of Speaker\r\nduring that term, than I ever did afterwards; and in subsequent\r\ncampaigns I was frequently gratified to find men, some of them\r\nDemocrats, who had been in the Legislature with me at that time,\r\nworking for me with a stronger zeal and earnestness because of the\r\nassociations and intimate relations there formed and cemented.\r\nAll classes, Republicans and Democrats alike, took occasion to\r\nmanifest their satisfaction, and some who became my friends then\r\ncontinued so as long as they lived.  I think, of all that Legislature,\r\nI am the only one left.\r\n\r\nA little incident occurred at a reception given by Mr. Lincoln\r\nafter he was elected President, but before he left his home to come\r\nto Washington, that vitally affected my life.  In speaking to the\r\nPresident, I expressed a desire to visit Washington while he was\r\nPresident of the United States.  He replied heartily:  \"Mr. Speaker,\r\ncome on.\"  And that was about the origin of my thinking seriously\r\nthat I would like to come to Washington as a member of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe more I thought of the idea, the more interested I became, and\r\nI so shaped matters during that session of the Legislature as to\r\nsecure a district in which some Republican could hope to be elected.\r\nIn the apportionment under the census of 1860, I had our Congressional\r\ndistrict elongated to the north and south rather than to the east\r\nand west, and let it be known that I would be a candidate.\r\n\r\nBut when the time came for a nomination the Hon. Leonard Swett,\r\nwho was then a prominent lawyer and politician, also took the field\r\nto secure the Republican nomination.  He visited Springfield, and\r\npersuaded some of his friends there that he ought to be the nominee,\r\nand they determined to try their hands toward securing my withdrawal,\r\nif possible by persuasion.  They sent for me to come to the library,\r\nwhere they were proposing to hold a meeting.  I went over, and\r\nfound that their project was to get me to withdraw in favor of\r\nSwett, and I declined.  But I said I would \"draw straws,\" or assent\r\nto any other fair means that could be found by which it was to be\r\nsettled who was to be the nominee of the party.  Then, after some\r\nfurther parleying, I finally left the conference.\r\n\r\nThat evening after dusk I met Swett on the street.  We sat down\r\nupon the curbstone, as it was growing a little dark, and talked\r\nthe matter over.  Swett said to me that he was an older man than\r\nI was; that he had been knocked about a good deal, and, though he\r\nhad done much work for the party, he had never got anything; and\r\nif the present opportunity for reward for services were allowed to\r\npass him by another opportunity was not likely, at his age, to come\r\nto him.  Finally, I said:  \"Mr. Swett, if you had come to me and\r\nmade this suggestion at first, I would have been very glad indeed\r\nto make the concession to you, and I am ready to do so now.  Here\r\nis my hand on it, and I will help you at the convention.\"  He became\r\nthe party candidate by general consent, as I remember it.  At all\r\nevents he was the candidate, and unfortunately he was beaten at\r\nthe polls.  That was in 1862.  So that while the Congressional\r\ndistrict was made by me, and for myself, I gave way to Mr. Swett,\r\nand the opposition carried it.  Two years afterwards I was the\r\ncandidate and was elected.\r\n\r\nThe majority in the counties composing the district was ordinarily\r\nRepublican.  As a result of Mr. Swett's defeat, he left the district,\r\nthough a very prominent lawyer, and went to Chicago, never to return\r\nto the Congressional district in which he had lived so many years,\r\nreally quitting politics entirely.\r\n\r\nI suppose I ought to state the fact that, having made the district\r\nfor myself and then given it up to Mr. Swett, I determined to be\r\na candidate at the next election; whereupon I found that Mr. James\r\nC. Conkling, a friend of mine, and a special friend of Mr. Lincoln\r\nalso, some of whose family are still living, was disposed to try\r\nfor the same office.  I made up my mind that in order to keep myself\r\nin trim for the future it was well to keep in touch with the voters;\r\nand I determined to run for the State Senate, though the four\r\ncounties composing the Senatorial district were all Democratic and\r\nall in the Congressional district in which Swett was the defeated\r\ncandidate, yet I desired to run for the Senate, in order to keep\r\nConkling from getting such a hold on the district as to strengthen\r\nhim for the contest two years afterwards.\r\n\r\nSo I made the run, and was beaten, of course, every county in the\r\ndistrict being Democratic; and the rest of my plans also worked\r\nout as I had calculated they would.\r\n\r\nSoon after I was elected to Congress, and soon after Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas elected the second time, I came on to Washington.  Having been\r\nintimate with Mr. Nicolay and Mr. Hay who were his secretaries, I\r\nwas in the habit of frequenting their rooms without ceremony.  One\r\nevening, just after dusk, I went to the White House and quietly,\r\nas usual, entered Mr. Nicolay's room.  It so happened that Mr.\r\nLincoln and Mr. Seward, with some other cabinet officers, were in\r\nthe room, holding a consultation.  I had opened the door before I\r\nobserved who were there.  President Lincoln saw me quite as soon\r\nas I saw him, and I was very much embarrassed.  He sang out cheerily,\r\n\"Come in!\" and turning to his Secretary of State, he added, \"Seward,\r\nyou remember my old friend Stuart?  Here is the boy that beat him.\"\r\nI stayed for only a moment, and then went out.  That is the nearest\r\nI ever came to participating in a cabinet meeting.\r\n\r\nThat incident in my life, as I now look back, punctuates, in my\r\nindividual way of thinking at this moment, the substantial close\r\nof what was mortal in that great man's earthly career.  The close\r\nof the four years of civil war was clearly in sight.  It was in\r\nmany respects a record-making and a record-breaking war.  The navies\r\nof the world, rendered helpless by the incidental effects of its\r\nthundering guns, had to be rebuilt.  For the first time in the\r\nworld's history the railroad and the electric telegraph played a\r\nvery considerable part.  The grip of insatiate despotism on Democratic\r\ninstitutions was effectually loosened far and wide.  For the first\r\ntime in war the lessons taught in the art of warfare by Alexander\r\nand Caesar were utterly ignored, and the \"Maxims of Napoleon\" were\r\nrelegated to the shelf, there to gather dust.  In short, in\r\ninaugurated a new era in the history not only of our own country\r\nbut of the entire world.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nLINCOLN\r\n1860 to 1864\r\n\r\nAs days and years pass by and an enlightened humanity studies and\r\ncomprehends the real greatness and simplicity of Abraham Lincoln,\r\nhe comes nearer and becomes dearer to all.  No weak compliment of\r\nwords can add to his renown, nor will any petty criticism detract\r\nfrom the glory which has crowned his memory.  The passing of time\r\nhas only added brightness to his character; the antagonisms of\r\nbitter war have left no shade upon his name; and the hatred which,\r\nfor a brief time, spent itself in harmless words has turned to\r\nreverence and love.\r\n\r\nHad he lived until February 12, 1911, he would have been one hundred\r\nand two years old.  Less than forty-five years ago, in the very\r\nprime of life, he was the Chief Magistrate of the Nation, guiding\r\nand controlling it in its great struggle for national existence.\r\nSuch a vast accumulation of history has been compressed into those\r\nyears, and such a wonderful panorama of events has passed before\r\nus in that comparatively brief time, that we are apt to think of\r\nLincoln as of the long ago, as almost a contemporary of Washington\r\nand of the Revolutionary fathers.  The immensity of the history\r\nwhich has been crowded into those forty-five years has distorted\r\nour mental vision, as ordinary objects are sometimes distorted by\r\nrefraction.  Yet when we reflect, the distortion disappears.  But\r\nthe wonder still remains.  The years during which the deeds of\r\nLincoln have been a memory to us do not carry us back to the early\r\ndays of our own country.  They do not carry us back even to the\r\ntime of Jackson, Webster, Clay, or Calhoun; yet the sacred halo of\r\npatriotic veneration invests as completely the name of Lincoln as\r\nof Washington.\r\n\r\nThe many personal memories of the martyred patriot that I can recall\r\nseem almost a dream to me.  It seems almost a vision of the\r\nunsubstantial imagination, when I think that I have known the one\r\nimmortal man of the century, and enjoyed his friendship.  He was\r\nthe very impersonation of humanity; his stature was above and beyond\r\nall others.  One hand reached back to the very portals of Mount\r\nVernon, while the other, giving kindly protection to the oppressed,\r\nstill reaches forward to guide, encourage, and sustain the people\r\nof this Nation.\r\n\r\nIt was my great good-fortune to know something of Abraham Lincoln\r\nfrom the time I was about twelve years old, and even earlier than\r\nthat I have a distinct recollection of hearing my father advising\r\nmen to employ Lincoln in important litigation.  Lincoln at that\r\ntime was about thirty years old, and even then was regarded as a\r\nreally great lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe first time I ever saw him in court he, assisted by Colonel E.\r\nD. Baker (afterwards a senator from Oregon, and killed at Ball's\r\nBluff), was engaged in the defence of a man on trial for murder.\r\nThe conduct of the defence made by those great lawyers produced an\r\nimpression on my mind that will never be forgotten.  Lincoln became\r\nthen my ideal of a great man, and has so remained ever since.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Mr. Lincoln was the Whig candidate for Congress, and it\r\nwas then that I first heard him deliver a political speech.  The\r\ncounty in which my father resided was a part of his Congressional\r\ndistrict.  When Lincoln came to the county my father met him with\r\nhis carriage and took him to all his appointments.  I went to the\r\nmeeting nearest my home--an open-air meeting held in a grove.  On\r\nbeing introduced, he began his speech as follows:  \"Fellow citizens,\r\never since I have been in Tazewell County my old friend, Major\r\nCullom, has taken me around; he has heard all my speeches, and the\r\nonly way I can hope to fool the old Major and make him believe I\r\nam making a new speech is by turning it end for end once in a\r\nwhile.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I determined to abandon the hard work on the farm to enter\r\nthe study of law at Springfield, my father being so close to Mr.\r\nLincoln, I went to him for advice.  He expressed a willingness to\r\ntake me into his own office as a student, but said that he was\r\nabsent on the circuit so much that he would advise me to enter the\r\nlaw office of Stuart and Edwards, two prominent Springfield lawyers,\r\nof whom I have written more at length in an earlier chapter.  There\r\nI would have the advantage of the constant supervision of one or\r\nthe other member of the firm.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until he left Springfield never to return, I had\r\nconstant means of observing Lincoln as a lawyer.  I was at times\r\nassociated with him as a junior counsel in the trial of law suits.\r\nI was employed in a murder case which Lincoln and Logan were\r\ndefending, I being the boy lawyer in the case.  They made a wonderful\r\ndefence.  I do not know whether the defendant was guilty or not,\r\nbut I do know that he was acquitted.\r\n\r\nDuring my life I have been acquainted with very many able lawyers,\r\nand I have no hesitation in saying that Lincoln was the greatest\r\ntrial lawyer I ever knew.  He was a man of wonderful power before\r\na court or jury.  When he was sure he was right, his strength and\r\nresourcefulness were well-nigh irresistible.  In the court-room he\r\nwas at home.  He was frank with the court, the juries, and the\r\nlawyers, to such an extent that he would state the case of the\r\nopposite side as fairly as the opposing counsel could do it; he\r\nwould then disclose his client's case so strongly, with such honestly\r\nand candor, that the judge and jury would be almost convinced at\r\nonce in advance of the testimony.  Judge Davis once said that the\r\nframework of Lincoln's mental and moral being was honesty, and that\r\na wrong cause was poorly defended by him.\r\n\r\nThe story is told that a man offered to employ him in a case and\r\ntold him the facts, which did not satisfy Lincoln that there was\r\nany merit in it.  He said to him:  \"I can gain your case; I can\r\nset a whole neighborhood at loggerheads; I can distress a widowed\r\nmother and six fatherless children, and thereby get for you six\r\nhundred dollars, which it appears to me as rightfully belongs to\r\nthem as to you.  I will not take your case, but I will give you a\r\nlittle advice for nothing.  You seem to be a sprightly young man,\r\nand I advise you to try your hand at making six hundred dollars in\r\nsome other way.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was for a time employed by the Illinois Central Railroad\r\nas one of its attorneys.  In a case in one of the counties of Judge\r\nDavis's circuit to which the railroad was a party, it was announced\r\nthat the company was not ready for trial, and the court inquired\r\nthe reason; to which Mr. Lincoln replied that Captain McClellan\r\nwas absent.  The court asked, \"Who is Captain McClellan?\"  Lincoln\r\nreplied that all he knew about him was that he was the engineer of\r\nthe Illinois Central Railroad.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange juggling of destiny and of fate!  In little more\r\nthan two years McClellan's fame had become world-wide as the general\r\nin charge of all the armies of the Republic, only to prove in the\r\nestimation of many people the most stupendous failure as a commander\r\nin all our military history; Davis had become a Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States; and Lincoln had reached the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nIn the trial of the murder case to which I have referred, I never\r\nsaw more striking evidence of Mr. Lincoln's power over a court.\r\nThere came a question of the advisability of certain testimony\r\nwhich was very vital to the defendant.  The question was thoroughly\r\nargued by Judge Logan and Mr. Lincoln until the court took a recess\r\nfor dinner at noon.  The Judge announced that he would render his\r\ndecision when the court reconvened.  The courthouse was filled on\r\nthe reconvening of court in the afternoon, and the Judge began\r\nrendering his opinion on the point in dispute.  It seemed to Mr.\r\nLincoln and those present that he was about to decide against the\r\nadmissibility of the evidence.  Lincoln sprang to his feet.\r\nApparently he towered over the Judge, overawing him.  He made such\r\na tremendous impression that the court apparently gave way, and\r\ndecided the point in the defendant's favor.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was not only a great statesman, but he was one of the\r\nablest, most astute, and shrewdest politicians whom I have ever\r\nknown.  From my earliest recollection of him he took keen interest\r\nin public affairs and was the foremost public man or politician in\r\nhis section of the State.  He was not among the first to join the\r\nRepublican party.  He clung to the old Whig party as long as a\r\nvestige of it remained.  Almost immediately after he drifted into\r\nthe Republican party, he became its recognized leader in Illinois,\r\nand his public utterances attracted the attention of the Nation to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI recollect having heard him utter the memorable words in the\r\nRepublican Convention of my State in 1858:\r\n\r\n\"A house divided against itself cannot stand.  This Government\r\ncannot permanently endure half slave and half free.  I do not expect\r\nthe Union to be dissolved--I do not expect the house to fall--but\r\nI do expect that it will cease to be divided.  It will become all\r\none thing, or all the other.\"\r\n\r\nWhat words of wisdom!  He looked through the veil between him and\r\nthe future and saw the end more clearly than any other man in public\r\nlife.  This was a carefully prepared speech, in which every word\r\nwas weighed.  Some of his friends, to whom it was read, advised\r\nhim not to use the clause I have quoted, \"a house divided against\r\nitself.\"  He was wiser than any of them.  With a self-reliance born\r\nof earnest conviction he said that the time had come when the\r\nsentiments should be uttered, and that if he should go down because\r\nof their utterance by him, then he would go down linked with the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nI listened to much of the great debate between Lincoln and Douglas,\r\nthe greatest political debate which ever took place in this country.\r\nI have always felt that Lincoln never expected to be elected to\r\nthe Senate in 1858.  I think he saw more clearly than any of us\r\nthat the advanced position which he took in that debate made his\r\nelection to the Senate at that time impossible.  He was then fighting\r\nfor a great principle.  He did carry a majority of the popular\r\nvote, but Douglas secured a majority of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nHis defeat apparently affected him little, if at all.  I felt very\r\nbadly when it became apparent that Douglas had secured a majority\r\nof the Legislature.  I met Lincoln on the street one day, and said:\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln, is it true that Douglas has a majority of the\r\nLegislature?\"  His reply was an affirmative.  I then expressed the\r\ngreat sorrow and disappointment that I felt.  He placed a hand upon\r\nmy shoulder, and said:  \"Never mind, my boy; it will all come\r\nright.\"  I believe that he then felt certain that the position he\r\ntook in that memorable debate would make him the logical candidate\r\nof the Republican party for the Presidency in 1860, which it did.\r\nAnd two years from that very day the Republican party celebrated\r\nits first national victory in his election as President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Mr. Lincoln never went to school; and he\r\nnever did to any great extent, but in a broad sense of the word,\r\nhe was an educated man.  He was a student, a thinker; he educated\r\nhimself, and mastered any question which claimed his attention.\r\nThere was no man in this country who possessed to a greater degree\r\nthe power of analyzation.\r\n\r\nHe was a student all his life.  One incident that occurred in\r\nSpringfield, some years before he finally left, will serve as an\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nAn old German came through the town and claimed that he could teach\r\nus all to read and speak German in a few weeks.  A class was\r\norganized for the purpose of studying German.  Lincoln became a\r\nmember of the class, and I also was in it, and I can see him yet\r\ngoing about with the German book in his pocket, studying it during\r\nhis leisure moments in court and elsewhere.  None of the rest of\r\nus learned much, but Lincoln mastered it, as he did every other\r\nsubject which engaged his attention.\r\n\r\nHis home life was a pleasant one.  I often visited at his home,\r\nand so far as my observation went, I do not hesitate to say that\r\nnot the slightest credence should be given to the many false stories\r\nthat have from time to time appeared, manufactured largely by those\r\nwho desired to write something new and sensational concerning the\r\nlife of President Lincoln in his home, and concerning Mrs. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was regarded generally as an ungainly man, and so he\r\nwas; and yet on occasions he appeared to me to be superior in\r\ndignity and nobility to almost any other man whom I have ever seen.\r\nI was present when the committee from the National Convention, that\r\ngave his first nomination for President, came to Springfield to\r\nnotify him of his nomination.  He stood in the rear of a double\r\nparlor in his home, and as the Hon. George F. Ashmun, president of\r\nthe convention, presented the members of the delegation one by one\r\nto him, I thought that he looked what he was--the superior of any\r\nman present.  Many of the eminent men composing that delegation\r\nhad believed that Lincoln was some sort of a monster.  I stood\r\namong them after they had met him and listened to their comments.\r\nThe lofty character, the towering strength, the majesty of the man\r\nhad made a great impression upon them.  They had come expecting to\r\nsee a freak; they discovered one of the princes of men.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, I must be permitted to refer to another occasion.\r\nIt so happened that I was in Washington when the President's son\r\nWillie died.  The funeral ceremony took place in the East Room of\r\nthe White House, in the presence of the President and his cabinet\r\nand a few other friends.  When the ceremony was about concluded\r\nand President Lincoln stood by the bier of his dead boy, with tear-\r\ndrops falling from his face, surrounded by Seward, Chase, Bates,\r\nand others, I thought I never beheld a nobler-looking man.  He was\r\nat that time truly, as he appeared, a man of sorrow, acquainted\r\nwith grief, possessing the power and responsibilities of a President\r\nof a great Nation, yet with quivering lips and face bedewed with\r\ntears, from personal sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe morning that Abraham Lincoln left his home in Springfield never\r\nto return is not to be forgotten.  It was early on the morning of\r\nthe eleventh of February, dark and gloomy, with a light snow falling.\r\nThere was a large crowd of his neighbors and friends at the station\r\nto bid him good-bye.  He held a sort of impromptu reception in the\r\nlittle railroad station.  There was no noisy demonstration.  As I\r\nrecollect it now, it was a solemn leave-taking.  Just before the\r\ntrain pulled out, Mr. Lincoln appeared on the rear platform of his\r\ncar.  Every head was bared, as if to receive a benediction, as he\r\nuttered his farewell address:\r\n\r\n\"My Friends:  No one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling\r\nof sadness at this parting.  To this place, and the kindness of\r\nthese people, I owe everything.  Here I have lived a quarter of a\r\ncentury, and have passed from a young to an old man.  Here my\r\nchildren have been born and one is buried.  I now leave, not knowing\r\nwhen or whether ever I may return, with a task before me greater\r\nthan that which rested upon Washington.  Without the assistance of\r\nthat Divine Being who ever attended him, I cannot succeed; with\r\nthat assistance, I cannot fail.  Trusting in Him, who can go with\r\nme, and remain with you, and be everywhere for good, let us\r\nconfidently hope that all will yet be well.  To His care commending\r\nyou, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an\r\naffectionate farewell.\"\r\n\r\nI was not present at the first inauguration of President Lincoln,\r\nbut I visited Washington many times during the years that he was\r\nPresident, and, knowing him as well as I did, and having known both\r\nNicolay and Hay, his secretaries, in Springfield, I naturally spent\r\nmuch time around the executive offices.  I had many conversations\r\nwith him during the early years of the war.  He had no military\r\neducation, but he soon demonstrated that he was in fact the real\r\ncommander-in-chief.  He liked General McClellan, and stuck to him\r\nuntil McClellan had demonstrated his absolute inefficiency for\r\ncommand.  McClellan was a great organizer.  He made the Army of\r\nthe Potomac the most perfect fighting machine, I might almost say,\r\nthat was ever known in military history.  But there he stopped.\r\nHe could organize, but he could not and did not, despite the urging\r\nand the anxiety of Mr. Lincoln, push forward his army to victory.\r\nI knew something of Mr. Lincoln's anxiety at the failure of McClellan\r\nto inaugurate an aggressive campaign.\r\n\r\nThe late O. M. Hatch of Illinois told me of a rather interesting\r\nincident which occurred on one occasion when the President,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Hatch, visited McClellan's army a few days prior\r\nto the battle of Antietam in September, 1862.  They spent the night\r\nin a tent, and, rising very early, at the President's suggestion\r\nthey took a walk before sunrise about the great camp, inspecting\r\nthe field, the artillery, the quarters, and all the appurtenances\r\nof the army.  Lincoln was in a pensive mood, and scarcely a word\r\nwas spoken.  Finally, just as the sun was rising, they reached a\r\ncommanding point; the President stopped, placed his left hand upon\r\nMr. Hatch's shoulder, and slowly waving his right in the direction\r\nof the great city of tents, seriously inquired:  \"Mr. Hatch, what\r\nis all this before us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. President,\" was the surprised reply, \"this is General\r\nMcClellan's army.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Hatch, no,\" returned Lincoln soberly, \"this is General\r\nMcClellan's body-guard.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be understood what these utterances signified:  they\r\nexpressed perfectly the prevailing belief that McClellan had failed\r\nto appreciate the purpose for which that magnificent fighting\r\nmachine had been created.\r\n\r\nI think I am justified in saying that after the earlier contests\r\nof the war had proven that great soldiers and great generals were\r\nnot always great leaders, President Lincoln became the able director,\r\nthe actual commander-in-chief of the forces of the United States.\r\nHe planned and ordered the larger movements of the War, and he held\r\nthe reins above and about all his armies, scarcely relaxing his\r\nwatchful care for a moment,--until events demonstrated the wisdom\r\nwith which he confided the military interests of our beloved country\r\nand the conduct of the war to Ulysses S. Grant.\r\n\r\nSome of us remember with what persistence during the Winter of 1862\r\nand 1863 many newspapers and a large share of the Northern people\r\njoined in the cry of \"On to Richmond!\"  Censure and criticism ran\r\nriot even among Northern Republicans.  In a three-line memorandum\r\nthe President showed the fallacy of that outcry, when he wrote:\r\n\"Our prime object is the enemy's army in front of us, and not with\r\nor about Richmond at all, unless it be incidental to the main\r\nobject.\"  At a later day he said to Hooker:  \"I think Lee's army,\r\nand not Richmond, is your sure objective point.\"\r\n\r\nModest and simple as he always was, never seeking power with\r\ninordinate ambition, simply that he might use power; still he was\r\nnever afraid to assume responsibility when it was his duty to assume\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI called on him one evening at the Soldiers' Home.  We spent the\r\nevening together, and naturally we talked of the war.  He discussed\r\nalmost all of his generals, beginning with McClellan.  At that time\r\nMcClellan was down on the James, and Pope was in the saddle in\r\nVirginia.  Pope, he feared, would be whipped, unless he could get\r\nmore troops, and he was trying to get McClellan back in order to\r\nsave Pope.  At that time he had not yet lost his faith in McClellan,\r\nbut he was complaining that McClellan was never ready for battle.\r\nAfter making all possible preparations, and with the enemy in front,\r\nhe would overestimate the size of the enemy's force, and demand\r\nmore troops.  Yet Mr. Lincoln said that he would rather trust\r\nMcClellan to get his army out of a tight place than any other\r\ngeneral that he had.\r\n\r\nAfter his election he invited his principal competitors for the\r\nnomination to enter his cabinet.  He had not the slightest jealousy\r\nof any living man.  He was not afraid, as some of our Presidents\r\nhave been, to have his cabinet composed of the greatest men of his\r\ntime.  He was a bigger man than any of them, and no thought of\r\njealousy ever entered his mind.  Both Seward and Chase fancied they\r\nwere greater men than Lincoln, and each of them, at the beginning\r\nat least, entertained the idea that on him rested the responsibility\r\nof the administration.  Seward felt that he should have been the\r\nnominee of his party.  Chase felt perfectly sure that he, and not\r\nLincoln, should have been President.\r\n\r\nBefore many months had passed, Seward was compelled to acknowledge\r\nthat Mr. Lincoln was the superior of any of them, as he expressed\r\nit in a letter to his wife.  He soon became one of the most devoted\r\nfriends and loyal supporters of the President.  The publication of\r\nthe diary of Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy from 1861 to\r\n1865, shows that Mr. Lincoln was the leader of them all, and was\r\nin fact the real head of every department of his administration.\r\n\r\nChase was an able man, and loyal to the Union; but, unlike Seward,\r\nhe was never loyal to the President personally, and was constantly\r\nplotting in his own interest to supplant Lincoln as the nominee of\r\nhis party in 1864,--a most reprehensible course on the part of a\r\ncabinet officer.  This did not give concern to Mr. Lincoln in the\r\nslightest degree.  He cared very little what Mr. Chase said or\r\nthought of him personally, so long as he was doing his duty as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nI was in Washington the latter part of February, 1864, before he\r\nwas nominated the second time.  I happened to hear of the Pomeroy\r\nletter in behalf of Mr. Chase, and I learned with amazement that\r\nChase was conspiring with his friends to secure the nomination for\r\nthe Presidency, and was untrue and unloyal to his chief.  I felt\r\njustly indignant.  I saw Mr. Lincoln and talked with him about it\r\nwith great earnestness.  I told him that Chase should be turned\r\nout.  He answered by saying:  \"Let him alone; he can do no more\r\nharm in here than he can outside.\"\r\n\r\nIf things did not go to suit him, Chase was in the habit of tendering\r\nhis resignation every few days.  It was not accepted; but he offered\r\nit once too often, and, very much to his surprise and chagrin, it\r\nwas promptly accepted; and Chase was relegated to private life,\r\nwhere he belonged, and where he should have remained.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Taney passed away unmourned, the most pathetic and\r\ndesolate figure in the Civil War, with his long, faithful, and\r\ndistinguished service on the bench forgotten.  Chase's friends,\r\nand Chase himself, at once commenced overtures of friendship toward\r\nMr. Lincoln, in the interest, solely, of securing Chase's appointment\r\nas Chief Justice.  Considerable pressure was brought to bear in\r\nbehalf of Chase.  The President would give no intimation as to what\r\nhe intended to do, although I myself believe that he all the time\r\nintended appointing him to the vacant position, and that the so-\r\ncalled pressure on the part of Sumner and other radicals had little,\r\nif any, influence with him.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, after the death of Chief Justice Taney, Chase\r\nwas not at all averse to writing the President the most friendly\r\nletters.  One day his secretary brought him a letter from Mr. Chase.\r\nThe President asked, \"What is it about?\"  \"Simply a kind and friendly\r\nletter,\" the secretary answered.  Mr. Lincoln, without reading it,\r\nreplied with his shrewd smile:  \"File it with his other recommendations.\"\r\n\r\nChase was finally appointed Chief Justice of the United States.\r\nAfter his conduct as a member of the cabinet, I do not believe we\r\nhave ever had another President, except Lincoln, magnanimous enough\r\nto have made that appointment under similar circumstances.  Lincoln\r\nentertained a very exalted opinion of Chase's ability as a lawyer\r\nand a man.  He believed that he possessed the qualifications of a\r\ngreat Chief Justice, and the appointment was made entirely free\r\nfrom any personal feelings or prejudices.\r\n\r\nI happened to be alone in Mr. Nicolay's room in the White House\r\nwhen Mr. Chase called to thank the President for his nomination.\r\nHe came into Mr. Nicolay's room first, and inquired of me if the\r\nPresident was in.  I told him I did not know, but his room was next\r\nto the one we were in, and he might ascertain for himself.  Knowing\r\nof Chase's disparaging remarks concerning Mr. Lincoln, and of his\r\ndisloyalty as a member of his cabinet, I was very curious to hear\r\nwhat he would have to say to the President.  He left the door ajar,\r\nand I overheard the conversation.  Mr. Chase proceeded to thank\r\nthe President for his nomination.  Mr. Lincoln's reply was brief,\r\nmerely that he hoped Mr. Chase would get along well and would do\r\nhis duty.  Very few words passed between them, and the interview\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nMontgomery Blair was Postmaster-General in President Lincoln's\r\ncabinet.  He was appointed from the District of Columbia.  He was\r\na man of considerable ability, and was thoroughly loyal to the\r\nPresident.  Montgomery Blair became exceedingly unpopular among\r\ncertain classes, not only on his own account, but because of his\r\nbrother Frank, whose home was in Missouri.  I thought his remaining\r\nin the cabinet was injuring the Administration, and I told Mr.\r\nLincoln, in a conversation I had with him at the White House, that\r\nunder all the circumstances Montgomery Blair should be relieved\r\nfrom office; that he was unpopular; that the people were not for\r\nhim.  Mr. Lincoln seemed annoyed, even to the extent of petulance\r\n(a rare thing with him), that I should say anything against Montgomery\r\nBlair.  He asserted that Blair was a loyal man, was doing his full\r\nduty as Postmaster-General, and that he would not turn him out.\r\n\r\nLater, Montgomery Blair, always loyal under all circumstances, told\r\nthe President that he was ready to tender his resignation whenever,\r\nin the judgment of the President, his remaining in the cabinet\r\nwould be an embarrassment; and Mr. Lincoln in a very kindly note\r\nsometime afterwards said that he felt himself compelled to accept\r\nMr. Blair's offer and ask for his resignation.  They continued\r\npersonal friends until the President's death.\r\n\r\nThe year 1862, on account of the proclamation of President Lincoln,\r\nin September, that he would free the slaves in those States or\r\nparts of States whose people continued in rebellion on and after\r\nJanuary 1, 1863, was a disastrous year to the Republican party;\r\nbut the final effect of the proclamation was beneficial to the\r\ncause of the Union.  It stimulated greater enthusiasm on the part\r\nof those who desired to see the end of slavery in this country.\r\nMany people so hated that institution that they were more desirous\r\nof having it abolished than to have the Union preserved with it.\r\n\r\nWhile President Lincoln was always opposed to slavery, unequivocally\r\nopposed to it, yet his oath called upon him to preserve the\r\nConstitution and the Union.  He said that his paramount object was\r\nto save the Union and not to save or destroy slavery.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 President Lincoln appointed three men, namely, Governor\r\nGeorge S. Boutwell, the Hon. Stephen T. Logan, and the Hon. Charles\r\nA. Dana, a commission to go to Cairo, Illinois, and settle the\r\nclaims of numerous persons against the Government, arising from\r\nproperty purchased by commissary officers and quartermasters in\r\nthe volunteer service before the volunteers knew anything about\r\nmilitary rules or regulations.  Judge Logan went to Cairo, remained\r\na few days, became ill, tendered his resignation, and returned\r\nhome.  The President telegraphed me an appointment, and asked me\r\nto go at once to Cairo for duty, which I did.  I had not known\r\neither Boutwell or Dana before.  The commission finished its work\r\nin about a month, and forwarded to Washington all papers, with its\r\nreport.  The claims were paid on the basis of our allowance, and\r\njustice was done to all concerned.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1862 an old friend of President Lincoln's, James Lamb,\r\ncame to see me, stating that he had been furnishing beef cattle to\r\nthe army; that he had received orders to furnish a given number on\r\nthe hoof at a certain place in the South, which he had done; but\r\nbefore his cattle arrived the army had gone, and he had thereby\r\nsuffered great loss.  He asked me to look after his claim when I\r\nwent to the National capital, and I agreed to do so.  I knew nothing\r\nabout such things in Washington, nor how such business with the\r\nGovernment was transacted.  I went to the President as the only\r\nofficial with whom I was acquainted, and stated to him, \"Uncle\r\nJimmie Lamb, your old friend, has a claim,\" setting forth the same\r\nin full.  \"You know he is a good man,\" I urged, \"and he ought to\r\nhave his money.\"  Lincoln answered me by saying:  \"Cullom, there\r\nis this difference in dealing between two individuals and between\r\nan individual and the Government:  if an individual does not do as\r\nhe agreed and the other person is injured thereby, he can sue the\r\none responsible for the injury, and recover damages; but in the\r\ncase of the Government, if it does not do right, the individual\r\ncan't help himself.\"  He gave me a note, however, to the proper\r\nofficer and the matter was arranged.\r\n\r\nThe gossip around the Capitol in Washington among Senators and\r\nRepresentatives is a very poor gauge of public sentiment in the\r\ncountry toward a President.  I was in Washington a few months before\r\nthe second nomination.  I talked with numerous Representatives and\r\nSenators, and it really seemed to me as if there was hardly any\r\none in favor of the renomination of Mr. Lincoln.  I felt much\r\ndiscouraged over the circumstance.  When I was about to leave for\r\nhome, I called at the White House.  I asked the President if he\r\npermitted anybody to talk to him about himself.  He replied that\r\nhe did.  I said:  \"I would like to talk to you about yourself.\"\r\nHe asked me to be seated.  Whereupon I told him that I had been in\r\nWashington some ten days or more, and that everybody seemed to be\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is not quite so bad as that,\" he said.  He took down his\r\ndirectory, and I soon discovered that he had a far more intimate\r\nknowledge of the situation than I had.  He had every one marked,\r\nknew how he stood, and the list made a better showing than I had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, however, that many of the strong men in Congress,\r\nespecially the radicals, were against his renomination, and would\r\nhave rejoiced to see some one else the nominee of the party; but\r\nthey knew full well, that the great body of the people of the North\r\nwere with him, and that it would be useless to attempt to prevent\r\nhis renomination.\r\n\r\nThe next time I called at the White House after the convention, he\r\nreminded me of our previous conversation, and remarked that it did\r\nnot turn out so badly after all.\r\n\r\nHe was reminded of a little story.  A couple of Irishmen came to\r\nAmerica and started out on foot into the country.  They travelled\r\nalong until they came to a piece of woods.  They thought they heard\r\na noise, but did not know what it was.  They deployed on either\r\nside of the road to find out, but were unable to do so, and finally\r\none called to the other, \"Pat, Pat, let's go on; this is nothing\r\nby a domned noise.\"  So the opposition to him, he said, was apparently\r\nnothing but a noise.\r\n\r\nBut if he never had any doubts as to his renomination, he at one\r\ntime almost despaired of being re-elected, as did many of his\r\nclosest and most intimate friends.  The Democrats had not yet\r\nselected their candidates, and as he remarked:  \"At this period we\r\nhad no adversary, and seemed to have no friends.\"\r\n\r\nAn incident in this connection is related by the late Secretary,\r\nJohn Hay.  The President felt that the campaign was going against\r\nhim, and he had made up his mind deliberately as to the course he\r\nshould pursue.  He resolved to lay down for himself a course of\r\naction demanded by his then conviction of duty.  He wrote on the\r\ntwenty-third of August the following memorandum:\r\n\r\n\"This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable\r\nthat this administration will not be re-elected.  Then it will be\r\nmy duty to so co-operate with the President-elect as to save the\r\nUnion between the election and the inauguration; as he will have\r\nsecured his election on such grounds that he cannot possibly save\r\nit afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nHe then folded and pasted the sheet in such manner that its contents\r\ncould not be read, and as the cabinet came together he handed this\r\npaper to each member successively, requesting him to write his name\r\nacross the back of it, without intimating to any member of the\r\ncabinet what the note contained.  In this manner he pledged himself\r\nto accept loyally the anticipated verdict of the people against him.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay's diary relates what took place at the next cabinet meeting\r\nafter the election, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"At the meeting of the cabinet to-day the President took out a\r\npaper from his desk and said:  'Gentlemen, do you remember last\r\nsummer I asked you all to sign your names to the back of a paper\r\nof which I did not show you the inside?  This is it.  Now, Mr. Hay,\r\nsee if you can open this without tearing it.'  He had pasted it up\r\nin so singular a style that it required some cutting to get it\r\nopen.  He then read this memorandum (quoted above).\r\n\r\n\"The President said:  'You will remember that this was written at\r\nthe time, six days before the Chicago nominating convention, when\r\nas yet we had no adversary and seemed to have no friends.  I then\r\nsolemnly resolved on the course of action indicated in this paper.\r\nI resolved in the case of the election of General McClellan, being\r\ncertain that he would be the candidate, that I would see him and\r\ntalk matters over with him.  I would say, \"General, the election\r\nhas demonstrated that you are stronger, have more influence with\r\nthe American people than I.  Now let us together, you with your\r\ninfluence, and I with all the executive power of the Government,\r\ntry to save the country.  You raise as many troops as you possibly\r\ncan for the final trial, and I will devote all my energies to assist\r\nand finish the war.\"'\r\n\r\n\"Seward said:  'And the General would have answered you, \"Yes,\r\nyes,\" and the next day when you saw him again and pressed these\r\nviews upon him, he would have said, \"Yes, yes,\" and so on forever,\r\nand would have done nothing at all.'\r\n\r\n\"'At least,' rejoined Lincoln, 'I should have done my duty and have\r\nstood clear before my own conscience.'\"\r\n\r\nNot the least of his troubles and embarrassments during the trying\r\nperiod preceding his second election was the overzealous advice,--\r\npersistence, I might say--on the part of certain New Yorkers and\r\nNew Englanders who seemed to think that they had the interest of\r\nthe Union and the country more at heart than had Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley was one of the most troublesome of this lot.  He\r\nwas an honest and a most loyal man, but was willing to temporize\r\nupon the most vital questions.  At one time he advised that the\r\n\"erring sisters\" should be permitted to depart in peace.  At this\r\nparticular time of which I speak he had devised a plan for a peace\r\nconference, with certain prominent Confederates, Clement C. Clay,\r\namong others, to be held in Canada.  Mr. Lincoln felt sure that\r\nthe conference would do no good, and that the Confederates were\r\nfooling Mr. Greeley, and that they had no real power to act.\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be exactly the truth.  I was with the President\r\njust as he was sending Mr. Hay to Niagara with written instructions,\r\nwhich were given to see that nothing which threatened the interests\r\nof the Government should be done.  The President was very much\r\nannoyed, and he remarked to me:  \"While Mr. Greeley means right,\r\nhe makes me almost as much trouble as the whole Southern\r\nConfederacy.\"\r\n\r\nWhile, as I have previously observed, Greeley was intensely loyal\r\nto the country, yet he was so nervous and unstable in his mind that\r\nhe could not resist the effort to bring about a condition of peace.\r\nI think he would have consented to almost anything in order to\r\nsecure it.  He was very anxious for the issuance of a proclamation\r\nabolishing slavery, and on the nineteenth of August, 1862, addressed\r\na very arrogant open letter to President Lincoln on the subject.\r\n\r\nLincoln's reply was so good, so perfect, and so conclusive that I\r\ngive it, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Executive Mansion,\r\n  \"Washington, _Friday, August 22, 1863_.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. Horace Greeley:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:  I have just read yours of the nineteenth instant,\r\naddressed to myself through _The New York Tribune_.\r\n\r\n\"If there be any statements or assumptions of facts which I may\r\nknow to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert them.\r\n\r\n\"If there may be any inferences which I may to believe to be falsely\r\ndrawn, I do not now and here argue against them.\r\n\r\n\"If there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone,\r\nI waive it in deference to an old friend whose heart I have always\r\nsupposed to be right.\r\n\r\n\"As to the policy 'I seem to be pursuing,' as you say, I have not\r\nmeant to leave any one in doubt.  I would save the Union.  I would\r\nsave it in the shortest way under the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"The sooner the National authority can be restored, the nearer the\r\nUnion will be--the Union as it was.\r\n\r\n\"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could\r\nat the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them.\r\n\r\n\"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could\r\nat the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them.\r\n\r\n\"_My paramount object is to save the Union, and not either to save\r\nor destroy slavery_.\r\n\r\n\"If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do\r\nit; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do\r\nit; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone,\r\nI would do that.\r\n\r\n\"What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I\r\nbelieve it helps to save the Union, and what I forbear, I forbear\r\nbecause I do not believe it would help to save the Union.\r\n\r\n\"I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts\r\nthe cause, and shall do more whenever I believe doing more will\r\nhelp the cause.\r\n\r\n\"I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors, and I shall\r\nadopt new views so fast as they will appear to be true views.\r\n\r\n\"I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official\r\nduty, and I intend no modifications of my oft-expressed personal\r\nwish that all men everywhere could be free.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours,\r\n  \"A. Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that Mr. Greeley remarked after reading the letter that\r\nhe had been knocked out by one letter from Mr. Lincoln, and that\r\nhe \"would be damned if he ever wrote him another.\"\r\n\r\nThere was more personal bitterness evinced against Mr. Lincoln in\r\nthe campaign of 1864 than ever before or since in a Presidential\r\ncampaign.  He was denounced in the most intemperate language as a\r\ntyrant, a dictator, whose administration had proven a failure.  A\r\ncertain element of so-called \"high class\" New Englanders, men of\r\nthe Wendell Phillips type, were particularly bitter in their\r\ndenunciation.  And I may remark in passing that the New England\r\nmen of letters never did have a proper appreciation of the worth\r\nof Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nHe was triumphantly re-elected amid the universal rejoicing of the\r\nfriends of liberty throughout the North.  He took the election very\r\nquietly.  He apparently felt no sense of personal triumph over his\r\nopponents and those who had so bitterly attacked him during the\r\ncampaign.  He seemed only to have a feeling of deep gratitude to\r\nhis fellow citizens who had testified their confidence in his\r\nadministration.  On the evening of election day, when it became\r\nevident that he was re-elected to the Presidency, in response to\r\na serenade he said:\r\n\r\n\"I am thankful to God for this approval by the people.  While deeply\r\ngrateful for this mark of their confidence in me, if I know my\r\nheart, my gratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph,\r\nbut I give thanks to the Almighty for this evidence of the people's\r\nresolution to stand by free government and the rights of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again in that eloquent, simple little response which he made\r\nto the joint committee of Congress appointed to wait upon him to\r\nnotify him of his second election, after the count of the electoral\r\nvotes by a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives\r\nin Congress, he said:\r\n\r\n\"With deep gratitude to my countrymen for this mark of their\r\nconfidence; with a distrust of my own ability to perform the duty\r\nrequired under the most favorable circumstances, and now rendered\r\ndoubly difficult by existing national perils; yet with a firm\r\nreliance on the strength of our free Government, and the eventual\r\nloyalty of the people to the just principles upon which it is\r\nfounded, and, above all, with an unshaken faith in the Supreme\r\nRuler of Nations, I accept this trust.  Be pleased to signify this\r\nto the respective Houses of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThese utterances show more clearly than any one else can describe\r\nthe state of mind in which the President received his re-election,\r\nand in which he was about to enter his second term as President of\r\nthe Republic.  Without any personal feeling of pride, he was certain\r\nin his own mind that his re-election was necessary in order to save\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nI attended the second inauguration, March 4, 1865.  I have a\r\nparticularly vivid recollection of the scene which took place in\r\nthe Senate chamber when Mr. Johnson took the oath as Vice-President.\r\nThe simple truth is, and it was plain to every one present in that\r\nchamber, Mr. Johnson was intoxicated.  Johnson delivered a rambling,\r\nsenseless address.  I sat next to Senator Lane of Indiana, and I\r\nremarked that somebody should stop him.  Lane sent up a note to\r\nthe Secretary of the Senate, telling him to get Johnson to cease\r\nspeaking and take the oath.  We felt Johnson was making an exhibition\r\nof himself in the presence of the President, the Cabinet, the\r\nForeign Representatives, and two Houses of Congress, and a gathering\r\nof the most distinguished men of the Nation.  The Secretary wrote\r\nsome lines and placed them before Mr. Johnson, who did not appear\r\nto notice them.  Finally he was made to understand that he must\r\ntake the oath, as the time had come when the President, according\r\nto usual custom, would have to go to the east front of the Capitol\r\nto take the oath as President of the United States.  Johnson, with\r\na sort of wild sweep of his arm said, \"I will take the oath, but\r\nI regard my devotion to the Union as greater evidence of my loyalty\r\nthan any oath I could take.\"\r\n\r\nI was close to Mr. Lincoln at the solemn moment when Chief Justice\r\nChase administered to him the oath of office.  There was a vast\r\ncrowd of people, great enthusiasm and rejoicing, and the war was\r\npractically over,--a far different scene from the one which took\r\nplace just four years before, when Chief Justice Taney in the same\r\nplace administered the same oath.  At that time there was no noisy\r\ndemonstration.  There was a solemn hush, as every one realized that\r\nthe country was about to be plunged into one of the mightiest civil\r\nwars of all history.  Indeed many men believed that there was a\r\nconcerted plot to assassinate Mr. Lincoln at that time, and that\r\nhe would never be permitted to enter upon the duties of his office.\r\n\r\nI heard him deliver his second inaugural address,--one of his two\r\ngreatest speeches.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw Abraham Lincoln alive was about three weeks\r\nbefore his assassination, as I now recollect.  He was at the White\r\nHouse.  There had been constant rumors throughout his first term\r\nthat he was in danger of some such outrage, but as the war drew to\r\na close, with the natural bitter and resentful feeling in the South,\r\nthese rumors seemed to increase.  I told him what I had heard, and\r\nurged him to be careful.  It did not seem to concern him much, and\r\nthe substance of his reply was that he must take his chances; that\r\nhe could not live in an iron box, as he expressed it, and do his\r\nduty as President of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for one who did not live in those terrible days\r\nfrom 1861 to 1865 to realize the awful shock of horror that went\r\nthrough the whole Nation on the morning of April 15, 1865, when\r\nthe message came, \"Abraham Lincoln is dead.\"  In his old home at\r\nSpringfield, it seemed the whole population assembled in the public\r\nsquare, and the duty devolved upon me to announce to the assembled\r\npeople that the great President had passed away.  There was intense\r\nsuppressed excitement.  No one dared utter a word in disparagement\r\nof Abraham Lincoln.  The crowd was in the humor for hanging to the\r\nlimb of the first convenient tree any one who dared to make a\r\nslighting suggestion.  It was not alone in Springfield, but it was\r\nthroughout the entire North that this feeling prevailed.  There\r\nwas fear that the Government would go to pieces, almost that the\r\nend of the world was at hand.\r\n\r\nSoon the news came from different sources that he was to be buried\r\nin Washington, or somewhere in the East.  The people of Springfield\r\nbecame very much worked up.  A committee was appointed to go to\r\nWashington to insist that the remains should be taken to Springfield.\r\nI was a member of this committee.  We left immediately, but before\r\nwe arrived at Harrisburg it had been determined that the only\r\nfitting final resting place of all that remained of the immortal\r\nLincoln was at his old home in Springfield; and the funeral train\r\nhad already left Washington.  The committee waited at Harrisburg\r\nfor its arrival.  Through the courtesy of Governor Curtin, of\r\nPennsylvania, we were permitted to board the train, and we accompanied\r\nthe remains from there to Philadelphia, New York, Albany, Buffalo,\r\nCleveland, Indianapolis, Chicago, and finally to Springfield.  At\r\neach place the remains lay in state and were viewed by hundreds of\r\nthousands of people.\r\n\r\nIn all, the entire journey consumed some twelve days from the time\r\nthe party left Washington until it arrived in Springfield.  It was\r\ndetermined that the funeral train should follow the same route and\r\nstop at practically the same places that Lincoln visited on his\r\nway to Washington to be inaugurated as the first Republican President\r\nof the United States.  The country was so wrought up no one seemed\r\ncertain what was to happen; no one knew but that there would be a\r\nsecond and bloodier revolution, in which the Government might fall\r\ninto the hands of a dictator; and it was thought the funeral trip\r\nwould serve to arouse the patriotism of the people, which it did.\r\n\r\nI never witnessed anything like the universal demonstration of\r\nsorrow, not only at every city where the remains lay in state but\r\nall during the entire route, at every little village and hamlet;\r\neven at cross-roads thousands of people would be gathered to catch\r\na glimpse of the funeral train as it passed by.  In Philadelphia\r\nthe casket rested in Independence Hall.  In New York I suppose not\r\nless than half a million people passed by to view the body.  General\r\nScott came down with the procession to the station, and to him I\r\nintroduced our Illinois friends.  His response was given in a most\r\ndignified and ponderous style:  \"Gentlemen, you do me great honor.\"\r\n\r\nThe farther west we proceeded, drawing constantly nearer to the\r\nhome of Lincoln, the more wrought up the people seemed to be.  In\r\nthe West there were not only expressions of deep sorrow, but of\r\nvengeance as well, especially toward the South.  Before the facts\r\nbecame fully known, it was thought that the assassination was the\r\nresult of a Southern conspiracy, and there was a feeling that the\r\nwhole South should be punished for the act of one of her misguided\r\nsons.  The body lay in state for two days in Chicago, and then came\r\nthe last stage of the journey to Springfield.  It first was taken\r\nto the State House, and was afterwards placed in the old vault at\r\nthe foot of the hill in Oak Ridge Cemetery, where it remained until\r\nthe monument was completed.  Bishop Simpson, one of the most eloquent\r\nmen in the Methodist Church, and a devoted friend of Mr. Lincoln\r\nduring his life, preached the funeral sermon.  The services at\r\nSpringfield were simple in the extreme, just as Mr. Lincoln would\r\nhave wished.  Steps were at once taken for the erection of the\r\nmonument, which stands in Oak Ridge Cemetery to-day.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can learn, every member of the funeral party that\r\naccompanied the remains of Abraham Lincoln from Washington to\r\nSpringfield, with the exception of Mr. E. F. Leonard and myself,\r\nhas passed away.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune to know Abraham Lincoln in all the walks of\r\nlife.  I knew him as President, and I was permitted to know him in\r\nthe sacred precincts of his family at home.  I have studied the\r\nlives of the great men of the world, and I do not hesitate to say\r\nnow, after nearly fifty years have passed away since his death,\r\nthat Abraham Lincoln was the peer in all that makes a man great,\r\nuseful, and noble, of any man in all the world's history.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nNOTABLES IN THE THIRTY-NINTH CONGRESS\r\n1864 to 1870\r\n\r\nI had a very active campaign for election to Congress in 1864.  As\r\nI have stated elsewhere, I had, while Speaker, so framed the district\r\nthat I thought it would surely be a Republican one; but very much\r\nto my surprise, it went Democratic when Mr. Swett was a candidate.\r\nFor a number of reasons I was more than anxious to carry the\r\ndistrict.  First, naturally I did not want to be defeated; second,\r\nI wanted to show that it was really a Republican district, and more\r\nespecially still on President Lincoln's account, I was solicitous\r\nthat a Republican should be elected from the President's own\r\ndistrict, as was President Lincoln also.  The National Committee\r\nassisted a good deal, and the President himself helped whenever\r\nthere was an opportunity.  I was elected by a good, safe majority,\r\nand entered the Thirty-ninth Congress in December, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois delegation in the Thirty-ninth Congress, when I entered\r\nthe House, while containing few members, still compared favorably\r\nwith other delegations, and consisted of very good men who reflected\r\ncredit on the State, and some of whom had far more than ordinary\r\nability.  General John A. Logan, of whom I have written in another\r\npart of these memoirs, was a very prominent member of the delegation\r\nand of the House.  E. B. Washburne was also a leading member.  He\r\nwas very influential, and at one time was in a sense the leader of\r\nthe House.  He early became prominent as one of the intimate friends\r\nand supporters of General Grant, who, every one supposed, would be\r\nthe nominee of the Republican party to succeed President Johnson.\r\nThaddeus Stevens was the real leader on every occasion when he\r\nchose to assume that position.  His whole interest, however, seemed\r\nto be concentrated on reconstruction, one of the greatest problems\r\nthat has ever confronted this country, and consequently he gave\r\nlittle attention to general legislation.  This gave Washburne quite\r\na commanding voice in shaping the general legislation of the House.\r\n\r\nJohn Wentworth was one of the best known citizens of Chicago of\r\nhis day, and was closely identified with the early history of the\r\ncity.  He was several times a member of the House.  I found him to\r\nbe a capable member of the Thirty-ninth Congress, a man of influence,\r\nand I liked him very much.  He was Mayor of Chicago when President\r\nLincoln was assassinated, and I recall that he was at the station\r\nat the head of the committee when the funeral train arrived in\r\nChicago.  John Wentworth was quite a character in our State politics,\r\nbut he was particularly noted as being one of the foremost citizens\r\nof his home city.\r\n\r\nBurton C. Cook, of Ottawa, was one of the ablest men in the Illinois\r\ndelegation.  He was a splendid man, a man of high character, one\r\nof the leaders of the bar of the State of Illinois, and retired\r\nfrom Congress to become general counsel of the Northwestern Railroad.\r\nHe occupied a very important place in the House, and was chairman\r\nof the Committee on the District of Columbia.  He could not endure\r\nridicule, and he was not particularly quick in argument, although\r\na very good debater.\r\n\r\nA rather humorous incident occurred on one occasion when he was\r\npushing a bill to have Pennsylvania Avenue paved.  Proctor Knott,\r\nfrom Kentucky, was then a member of the House, and one of its\r\ncleverest and wittiest speakers.  I was called to the chair because\r\nCook knew that I would take care of him the best I could in the\r\nconduct of the bill through the committee of the whole.  We got\r\nalong with the bill very well for a good part of the day, until\r\nKnott took the floor and made one of his incomparably funny speeches,\r\ndepicting the situation on Pennsylvania Avenue, with its fine\r\ncarriages and outfits, with buckles on the coachmen's hats as big\r\nas garden gates.  He made so much fun of the bill that Cook, being\r\nunable to stand it, moved that the committee rise.  We never heard\r\nof the bill afterwards.\r\n\r\nS. S. Marshall, a Democrat from Southern Illinois, and prominent\r\nas such, was a member of Congress for many terms, and at one time\r\nwas the leader of the minority in the House.  At that time the\r\nDemocrats in the House were so few in number that occasionally they\r\nwere unable to secure the ayes and noes.  They exercised very little\r\ninfluence on legislation, and were not much in evidence in debate,\r\nthe main contest then being between the radical and conservative\r\nelements of the Republican party over Reconstruction.\r\n\r\nGeneral John F. Farnsworth of St. Charles was quite influential as\r\na member, and a very strong man, but was particularly noted for\r\nhis dauntless courage.  On one occasion I saw him shake his fist\r\nin General Benjamin F. Butler's face, daring him to resent it.\r\nButler did not resent it, as the House was in session; and, any\r\nway, excepting with his tongue, Butler was not a fighting man.\r\n\r\nEbon C. Ingersoll, who was familiarly called by his friends Clark\r\nIngersoll, served in that Congress.  He was a very clever man,\r\npossessed of considerable talent, and could on occasions deliver\r\na capitally witty speech.  I remember a rather ingenious passage\r\nfrom one of his speeches delivered when the controversy between\r\nthe President and Congress was at its height.  He asserted that\r\nthe country was sorely afflicted; that it suffered all sorts of\r\ntroubles, trials, embarrassments and difficulties.  First, he said,\r\nit was afflicted with cholera, next with trichinae, and then with\r\nAndy Johnson, all in the same year, and that was more than any\r\ncountry could stand.  Ebon C. Ingersoll was a brother of the famous\r\nRobert G. Ingersoll, the world's greatest agnostic.\r\n\r\nRobert G. Ingersoll was one of the most eloquent men whom I have\r\never heard.  He could utter the most beautiful sentiments clothed\r\nin language equally beautiful.  Speaking of death and the hereafter\r\none day, I heard him express himself in about the same language he\r\nafterward used on the lecture platform.  It made a wonderful\r\nimpression on me.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"And suppose after all that death does end all?  Next to eternal\r\njoy, next to being forever with those we love and those who have\r\nloved us, next to that, is to be wrapt in the dreamless drapery of\r\neternal peace.  Next to eternal life is eternal sleep.  Upon the\r\nshadowy shore of death, the sea of trouble casts no wave.  Eyes\r\nthat have been curtained by the everlasting dark, will never know\r\nagain the burning touch of tears.  Lips touched by eternal silence\r\nwill never speak again the broken words of grief.  Hearts of dust\r\ndo not break.  The dead do not weep.  Within the tomb no veiled\r\nand weeping sorrow sits, and in the rayless gloom is crouched no\r\nshuddering fear.\r\n\r\n\"I had rather think of those I have loved, and lost, as having\r\nreturned to earth, as having become a part of the elemental wealth\r\nof the world--I would rather think of them as unconscious dust, I\r\nwould rather dream of them as gurgling in the streams, floating in\r\nthe clouds, bursting in the form of light upon the shores of worlds,\r\nI would rather think of them as the lost visions of a forgotten\r\nnight, than to have even the faintest fear that their naked souls\r\nhave been clutched by an orthodox God.  I will leave my dear where\r\nNature leaves them.  Whatever flower of hope springs up in my heart,\r\nI will cherish, I will give it breath of sighs and rain of tears.\r\nBut I cannot believe that there is any being in this universe who\r\nhas been created for eternal pain.\"\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the manner in which Robert Ingersoll outraged\r\nthe members of every Christian denomination by attacking and\r\nridiculing their beliefs, he would certainly have been called to\r\nhigh office in the Nation.  He did not spare any denomination.\r\nBeginning with the Catholics and ending with the Baptists, he abused\r\nthem all, made fun of them, and mercilessly pointed out their weak\r\npoints.  He was always particularly bitter against the Presbyterian\r\nChurch, because, he declared, he was raised a Presbyterian, and\r\nknew more about that church than any other.  The two brothers were\r\nvery fond of each other, and Ebon C. never seemed to tire of talking\r\nabout his brother's great talent.  Robert G. was nearly broken-\r\nhearted when his brother died.  One of the most touching and eloquent\r\naddresses which I have ever heard was the address he delivered on\r\nthe occasion of Ebon's funeral.  He stood at the head of the casket\r\nand once or twice nearly broke down.  It was in that address,\r\nstanding there in the presence of death, that he expressed some\r\ndoubts as to the truth of his own teaching and intimated the\r\npossibility of some life beyond the grave.  This was the only public\r\noccasion of which I have any knowledge in which Robert G. Ingersoll\r\nseemed to falter in his course.\r\n\r\nWe were very intimate, and it is a real pleasure to me to pay him\r\nhere a tribute.  He was a man of extraordinary talent and ability,\r\none of the most lovable natures, and a man of the cleanest, most\r\ndelightful home life.  In many respects, I regard him as one of\r\nthe greatest men of his day; certainly he was the greatest agnostic\r\nof his time, if not of all time.  No one has taken his place.  The\r\nvery name, Agnostic, is now rarely heard.  And why?  Because Robert\r\nG. Ingersoll mercilessly tore down.  He did not create, or build\r\nanything; he attempted to take away the beliefs in all religion,\r\nand he offered nothing in return.  Hence it is that his teachings\r\nhave practically died with him.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the Illinois delegation in the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress, a well-known citizen of the State, was Anthony Thornton.\r\nHe had been a member of the Supreme Court of the State, was a fine\r\nlawyer of the best type of manhood, and he enjoyed the confidence\r\nand respect of the members of the House.  He resided in Shelbyville,\r\nbut after retiring from Congress he decided to go to Decatur, where\r\nthere was more business for a lawyer, and better opportunities.\r\nHe did not succeed very well, however, because it was too late in\r\nhis life to make a change and enter new fields.\r\n\r\nA little incident connected with him occurred while I was Governor\r\nof the State.  A young boy, whose parents the Judge knew, committed\r\na burglary and was sent to the penitentiary.  The parents of the\r\nboy were naturally anxious to get him out, and appealed to Judge\r\nThornton to assist in securing his pardon.  The Judge and I had\r\nserved in Congress together, and, naturally, any plea bearing his\r\nendorsement would have great weight with me.  Believing that the\r\nboy had been influenced by bad companions, he yielded and came to\r\nSpringfield to see me.  I looked the case over and finally said:\r\n\r\n\"Judge Thornton, you are an older man than I am; you were in Congress\r\nwith me; you have been a Judge of the Supreme Court of the State;\r\nif you will say that you would issue this pardon if you occupied\r\nthe chair I now occupy as Governor of this State, I will pardon\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied:  \"Governor, I would not ask you to do a thing I would\r\nnot do myself, to save my right arm.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon I at once issued the pardon.\r\n\r\n\"Judge,\" I told him, \"the train will leave in a short time; go to\r\nJoliet and take the boy home with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not do this; but he thanked me very cordially and said that\r\nhe would see the boy as soon as he got home.  The very night the\r\nboy left the penitentiary and returned home, he committed another\r\nburglary and was immediately arrested.  I happened to see an account\r\nof the crime in the papers next morning, and I cut it out and sent\r\nit to Judge Thornton, with the inquiry, \"Judge, what does this\r\nmean?\"  He at once came to Springfield, and told me that he had\r\nbeen fooled in prevailing upon me to pardon the young man, and\r\npledged me that he would follow him to the ends of the earth if\r\nnecessary in order to punish him for his crime.  The boy was sent\r\nback to the penitentiary and I never heard of him afterwards.\r\n\r\nJudge Thornton was one of the most honorable of men, a man of\r\nlearning and legal ability as well.\r\n\r\nOne day, before I was elected to the Thirty-ninth Congress, President\r\nLincoln was talking with me about the different members of that\r\nbody.  \"There is a young man by the name of Blaine now serving in\r\nCongress,\" said he, \"who seems to be one of the brightest men in\r\nthe House.  His speeches are always short, always full of facts,\r\nand always forcible.  I am very fond of him.  He is one of the\r\ncoming men of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThis was one of the reasons why I was early attracted to Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nHe was candidate for Speaker in the Forty-first Congress.  I was\r\nrather zealous in his behalf, and had more or less of a prominent\r\npart in his selection.  When Mr. Blaine concluded that he would be\r\na candidate for the Speakership, a little dinner was given at\r\nWelkers', a rather famous restaurant in Washington, at which Judge\r\nKelley, Judge Orth, the late Senator Allison, who was then a member\r\nof the House from the State of Iowa; Mr. Mercur of Pennsylvania,\r\nthe gentleman at the head of the Associated Press in Washington,\r\nand myself were present.  After the dinner it was given out to the\r\npress that Mr. Blaine was a candidate for Speaker.  As the campaign\r\nprogressed it seemed to depend on Mr. Allison and me more largely\r\nthan on any other members to take care of his interests.  He was\r\nelected Speaker, and I had been given to understand by him, and\r\nhad so communicated to friends in Congress whom I had induced to\r\nsupport Mr. Blaine, that I should be consulted in the make-up of\r\nthe committees.  Mr. Blaine never said a word to me on the subject,\r\nbut almost at the last moment wrote me this note:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Cullom:\r\n\r\n\"Which committee would you prefer, Territories or Claims?\r\n\r\n  \"James G. Blaine.\"\r\n\r\nI selected Territories and became chairman of that committee.\r\nAllison told me he never spoke to him in reference to committees,\r\nalthough he gave him important assignments.\r\n\r\nProbably the most bitter enemy Mr. Blaine ever had in public life\r\nwas Roscoe Conkling, a Senator from New York.  The quarrel between\r\nBlaine and Conkling commenced in the Thirty-ninth Congress, over\r\nsome very trivial matter, and continued from that time on until\r\nBlaine was nominated as the candidate of the Republican party for\r\nthe Presidency, in 1884, in which contest he was defeated by Grover\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nI occupied a seat next to Mr. Conkling during the early years of\r\nmy service in Congress.  He was a very friendly, companionable man,\r\nespecially to any one whom he did not consider a rival, and, as I\r\nwas a young man just entering Congress and politics, he gave me\r\nhis friendship.  I was present, sitting next to Conkling, when the\r\nfamous controversy in the House took place between Blaine and\r\nConkling.  During the session, from time to time, they had been\r\nquarreling.  Conkling had seemed to have a little the best of the\r\nargument.  Blaine became exasperated one day, and in the course of\r\nthe debate gave Conkling the worst \"tongue lashing\" probably ever\r\ngiven by one man to another on the floor of the House.  Conkling,\r\nalthough unable to reply effectively, demeaned himself with great\r\ndignity.  His manners were placid and his reply was in measured\r\nterms.  It was in striking contrast to what Mr. Blaine said.  To\r\nuse a phrase graphic if inelegant, he jumped on Conkling with both\r\nfeet and literally tore him to pieces without any attempt at dignity.\r\nThis controversy with Conkling probably caused the defeat of Mr.\r\nBlaine for the nomination--first, in conventions prior to 1884,\r\nand finally after he became the nominee of that year.\r\n\r\nBlaine was a candidate for President for many years.  It seemed to\r\nbe his destiny, as it was that of Henry Clay, to be able to secure\r\nthe nomination only when the Republican party went down in defeat,\r\nas it did for the first time since the election of Lincoln.  He\r\nwas beaten in the Republican National Conventions by men of mediocre\r\nability when the party was victorious.\r\n\r\nHe was a leading candidate at the Cincinnati Convention, when Hayes\r\nwas nominated.  I was there and heard Ingersoll's great speech\r\nplacing him in nomination.  I have always felt that Blaine would\r\nhave been nominated by that convention if a strong, courageous\r\npresiding officer had been in the chair.  As I sat behind Mr.\r\nMcPherson, the presiding officer, and watched the proceedings, I\r\nthought that if I had had that gavel in my hands there would have\r\nbeen no adjournment and James G. Blaine would have been nominated.\r\nAn adjournment was secured, however; the lights were extinguished,\r\nand the enemies of Blaine united, and Hayes became the nominee.\r\n\r\nBut at the convention held in Chicago, in 1884, no other candidate\r\nwas seriously considered, and Blaine was nominated for President\r\nand Logan for Vice-President.\r\n\r\nI had to do much in connection with Blaine in the campaign of 1884.\r\nHe was a very agreeable man so long as things went to suit him;\r\nbut he did not attempt to control himself when things went at all\r\nagainst him.  He was campaigning through Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois,\r\nin 1884; I had been on the platform with him at Massillon, Ohio,\r\nwhen the people would scarcely listen to any one except Mr. McKinley.\r\nIt was arranged that Blaine should come from La Fayette, Indiana,\r\nto Springfield, Illinois.  I was chairman of the delegation consisting\r\nof one hundred of the most prominent men of the State, selected to\r\naccompany him to Springfield.  The delegation went to La Fayette,\r\nand the Adjutant-General of the State and I waited on Mr. Blaine\r\nat the residence of Mr. George Williams, who is still living and\r\nwhom I have always known intimately.  Mr. Blaine's son came down\r\nin response to our call, announcing that his father had retired,\r\nill, and would not be disturbed until eight o'clock in the morning.\r\nAt the hour appointed we still had difficulty in seeing him, and\r\nfinally I enlisted the assistance of Mr. McKinley, who was there,\r\nand the Hon. Joseph Medill of _The Chicago Tribune_, to help me to\r\nprevail upon Blaine to keep his engagement.  He had come to the\r\nconclusion that he ought to go back East; that he was needed there\r\nmore than he was in the West.  The truth was that he was trying to\r\nevade the Springfield engagement.  I told him that there would be\r\nno less than a hundred thousand people from all parts of the State\r\ngathered at Springfield to see him, and it would not do to disappoint\r\nso vast a crowd.  He finally consented to go, but was very ungracious\r\nabout it, telling us not to disturb him during the trip from La\r\nFayette to Springfield, and at once retired to his drawing-room.\r\n\r\nWe soon came to a city in Indiana where there was a large crowd to\r\ngreet him, and following his orders, the train did not stop.  He\r\nemerged from his drawing-room very angry because the train had not\r\nbeen stopped when a crowd was waiting to hear him.  Afterwards we\r\nhalted at almost every station on the line to Springfield, where\r\nwe did not arrive until almost dusk.  Probably a hundred thousand\r\npeople had been gathered there during the day, and at least fifty\r\nthousand waited until we arrived; but it was so dark that the\r\naudience could scarcely see the speaker.  He left for Chicago that\r\nnight, hurrying through that city; hence to Wisconsin, I believe,\r\nmaking enemies rather than friends.  He had gained the election by\r\nhis Western tour, but lost it during his stay in New York City.\r\n\"Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion,\" the Delmonico dinner, the old row\r\nwith Conkling beginning in the Thirty-ninth Congress, caused his\r\ndefeat.  I told him afterwards that if he had broken his leg in\r\nSpringfield and been compelled to remain as my guest there, he\r\nwould have been elected.  He agreed with me that he would.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his defeat, however, he continued as one of the\r\nforemost leaders of the Republican party up to the time of his\r\ndeath.  He might have been nominated at the Chicago Convention,\r\nwhen Mr. Harrison received the nomination the first time had he\r\nnot retired to Europe, apparently so disgusted at his own defeat\r\nfour years before that he had not the heart to make the race again.\r\n\r\nI do not think Harrison ever did like Blaine, but he invited him\r\nto become the Premier of his cabinet, a position which Mr. Blaine\r\nhad held for a few months under General Garfield.  Harrison and\r\nBlaine never got along.  As I say elsewhere in these recollections,\r\nHarrison seemed jealous of Blaine, and Blaine was not true to his\r\nchief.  Mr. Blaine sent for me one evening, and I called at his\r\nhouse.  He related to me with considerable feeling how the President\r\nhad treated both his family and himself.  He urged me to become a\r\ncandidate for President, but I told him that I would not think of\r\ndoing so.  I afterwards supported Mr. Harrison for reasons personal\r\nto myself, and not because I was particularly fond of Mr. Harrison.\r\n\r\nJames G. Blaine retired to private life and died soon afterwards,\r\na broken, disappointed man.  He was one of the greatest men of his\r\nday, and was the most brilliant and probably the most popular man\r\nwith the masses in the history of the Republican party.\r\n\r\nRutherford B. Hayes was the nineteenth President of the United\r\nStates, and preceded General Garfield in that office.  He was\r\nneither as great a man nor as great an orator as General Garfield,\r\nalthough he was a much better executive officer, and in my opinion\r\ngave a better administration than General Garfield would have given\r\nhad he served the term for which he was elected.  Rutherford B.\r\nHayes was an inconspicuous member of the House, as I recollect him\r\nnow.  He was what I would term a very good, conscientious man, who\r\nnever made any enemies; but I do not think that any one would say\r\nthat he was a great man.  He did not talk very much in the House,\r\nnor accomplish very much.  I became quite friendly with him there.\r\nSubsequently he was nominated for Governor of Ohio, and he invited\r\nme to come to the State and campaign for him, which I did.\r\n\r\nThurman was his opponent, a very strong and able man, who subsequently\r\nbecame a Senator from Ohio, and was a nominee of the Democratic\r\nparty for Vice-President.  But Hayes defeated him for the Governorship,\r\nand was once re-elected.  He was nominated for President at the\r\nCincinnati Convention of 1876, when Blaine really should have been\r\nthe nominee, and would have been had the permanent chairman of the\r\nconvention, Edward McPherson, grasped the situation and held it\r\nwith a firm hand.\r\n\r\nMcPherson, while a man of good intentions, earnest and sincere,\r\nwas Clerk of the House for many years and had occupied what might\r\nbe termed a subordinate position.  The fact of the matter is that\r\nhe permitted the convention to get away from him; an adjournment\r\nwas secured, and the same night it was framed up to beat Blaine by\r\nnominating Hayes.\r\n\r\nHayes was just the kind of man for a compromise candidate.  He was\r\nseriously handicapped all through his administration owing to the\r\nmanner in which he secured the office.  The Electoral Commission,\r\nan unheard-of thing, created by act of Congress, by eight to seven\r\ndeclared that Hayes was elected over Tilden.  Very many people were\r\nof the opinion that Tilden was entitled to the office.  The Electoral\r\nCommission never would have been agreed to by the Democrats had\r\nthey known that Judge David Davis, of our own State, would retire\r\nfrom the Bench to take a place in the Senate; and it is almost\r\ncertain that had Judge Davis remained on the bench he would have\r\nbeen a member of the Electoral Commission, and would have surely\r\nvoted in favor of Tilden, which would have made him President.\r\n\r\nWhile Hayes was President the \"green-back craze\" seemed to almost\r\ntake possession of the country.  I delivered an address at Rockford,\r\nIllinois, before an agricultural society, taking issue to some\r\nextent with the public sentiment of the country, and favoring sound\r\nmoney.  The President was going through the country at that time\r\non a speaking tour, and in the course of some of his addresses he\r\ncommended what I had said.  He, accompanied by General Sherman,\r\nvisited Springfield, and I entertained them at the Executive\r\nMansion.\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes, himself realizing the embarrassment under which\r\nhe entered the office of President, was not a candidate for\r\nrenomination, and very wisely so.  But as I have said, President\r\nHayes was a good man; he made a very commendable record as President\r\nof the United States, and he was specially fortunate in the selection\r\nof his cabinet, showing rare discrimination in selecting some of\r\nthe ablest men in the country as his advisers.  Evarts was his\r\nSecretary of State, and John Sherman Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather peculiar coincidence that both James A. Garfield\r\nand R. B. Hayes were members of the Ohio delegation in the Thirty-\r\nninth Congress, and both afterwards arrived at the Presidency.\r\n\r\nJames A. Garfield was a man of extraordinary ability.  I was very\r\nintimate with him during our service in the House.  He was an\r\nextremely likable man; I became very fond of him, and I believe\r\nthe feeling was reciprocated.  Also he was distinguished for his\r\neloquence, and I have heard him make some of the most wonderfully\r\nstirring and impressive speeches in the House.  He was probably\r\nnot the orator that Robert G. Ingersoll was, but I should say that\r\nhe was one of the most effective public speakers of his period;\r\nhis speeches were deeper and more serious, uttered in a graver\r\nstyle than the beautiful poetic imagery of the great agnostic.\r\nPresident Lincoln liked Garfield, and he was one of the younger\r\nmen in the House who always supported the President, and on whom\r\nthe President relied.  He entered the Thirty-eighth Congress and\r\nserved many terms.  He enjoyed the peculiar distinction of being\r\na member of Congress from Ohio, Senator-elect from Ohio, and\r\nPresident-elect of the United States, all at the same time.\r\n\r\nI attended the National Republican Convention of 1880, in which\r\nGrant and Blaine were the leading candidates.  I was at the time\r\nGovernor of Illinois and a candidate for re-election myself;\r\nconsequently I could not take any active part in the contest between\r\nBlaine and Grant, but of course, naturally, my sympathies were with\r\nGeneral Grant.\r\n\r\nI was not a delegate to the National Convention, but I attended\r\nit, and it so happened that I occupied a room directly opposite\r\nthat occupied by General Garfield.\r\n\r\nOne evening, leaving my room, I met General Garfield just as he\r\nwas leaving his, and we dropped into general conversation and walked\r\nalong together.\r\n\r\nI have always been considered a pretty fair judge of a political\r\nsituation in State and National conventions, and it struck me as\r\nsoon as Garfield had completed one of the most eloquent of all his\r\neloquent addresses, placing in nomination Mr. Sherman, that he was\r\nthe logical candidate before that convention.\r\n\r\nTo digress for a moment, it is a peculiar coincidence that McKinley\r\nmade his great reputation, in part, by nominating Mr. Sherman as\r\na candidate for the Presidency in the Minneapolis convention of\r\n1892.  Like General Garfield in 1880, Mr. McKinley was perfectly\r\nwilling to receive the nomination himself, although he was then,\r\nas Garfield was in 1880, the leader of the Sherman forces.\r\n\r\nBut to return.  General Garfield and I walked down the hall together,\r\nand being very intimate friends, I used to call him by his first\r\nname, as he did me.  I said:  \"James, if you will keep a level\r\nhead, you will be nominated for the Presidency by this convention\r\nbefore it is over.\"  This was a couple of days before he was actually\r\nnominated.\r\n\r\nHe replied:  \"No, I think not.\"\r\n\r\nBut as we walked along together discussing the matter, I contended\r\nthat I was right.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that memorable struggle between Grant and Blaine, in\r\nwhich the great Republican party refused to accept General Grant,\r\nthe foremost Republican and soldier of his time, Garfield was\r\nnominated.\r\n\r\nI remember vividly the form and features of Garfield in that\r\nconvention.  I see him placing Sherman in nomination, probably not\r\nrealizing at the time that he was nominating himself.  I see him\r\ntaking an active part in all the debates, and as I look back now\r\nI do not think I ever saw a man apparently so affected as General\r\nGarfield was when it was announced that he was the nominee of the\r\nRepublican party for the Presidency of the United States.  Seemingly\r\nhe almost utterly collapsed.  He sank into his seat, overcome.  He\r\nwas taken out of the convention and to a room in the Grand Pacific,\r\nwhere I met him a very few minutes afterward.\r\n\r\nAfter General Garfield was elected to the Presidency, but before\r\nhis inauguration, I determined that I would urge upon him the\r\nappointment of Mr. Robert T. Lincoln as a member of his cabinet.\r\nI thought then that his selection would not only be an honor to\r\nthe State, but that the great name of Lincoln, so fresh then in\r\nthe minds of the people, would materially strengthen General\r\nGarfield's administration.\r\n\r\nWith this purpose in view, I visited Garfield at his home in Mentor.\r\nThis journey was an extremely difficult one, owing to the circumstance\r\nthat the snow was yet deep on the ground; so I arranged with the\r\nconductor to stop at the nearest point to General Garfield's house\r\nto let me off, which he did.  I walked from the train through banks\r\nof snow, and after the hardest kind of a walk, finally reached his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nI at once told him the mission on which I had come.  We had quite\r\na long talk, at the end of which he announced that he would appoint\r\nMr. Lincoln his Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I desire to say a few words concerning Robert\r\nT. Lincoln.  He is still living.  I have known him from boyhood.\r\nHe has the integrity and the character which so distinguished his\r\nfather, and was marked in his mother's people as well.  It is my\r\nfirm conviction that long ago Robert T. Lincoln could have been\r\nPresident of the United States had he possessed the slightest\r\npolitical aspiration.  He has never been ambitious for public\r\noffice; but, on the contrary, it has always seemed to me that the\r\nPresidency was especially repugnant to him, which would be natural,\r\nconsidering the untimely death of his father, if for no other\r\nreason.  He was almost forced to take an active interest in public\r\naffairs, but as soon as he was permitted to do so he retired to\r\nprivate life to engage in large business undertakings, and finally\r\nto become the head of the Pullman Company.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange to me that he should consider the presidency of\r\na private corporation, no matter how great the emoluments, above\r\nthe Presidency of the greatest of all Republics.  How unlike his\r\nfather!  He was a most excellent Secretary of War, and one of\r\nGeneral Garfield's cabinet officers whom General Arthur invited to\r\nremain in his cabinet, which he did.\r\n\r\nUnder President Harrison he consented to become Minister to England.\r\nNeither my colleague, Senator Farwell, nor I favored this appointment\r\n--not because of any antipathy for Mr. Lincoln, for whom I not only\r\nhave the highest respect and admiration, but like personally as\r\nwell; but Mr. Blaine, who was Harrison's Secretary of State, called\r\non me one day and asked me to recommend some first-class man from\r\nIllinois for the post.  After a consultation with my colleague, we\r\ndetermined to recommend an eminent lawyer and cultured gentleman\r\nof Chicago, John N. Jewett.  We did recommend him, and assumed that\r\nhis appointment was assured; but Harrison--probably to humiliate\r\nMr. Blaine--called Senator Farwell and me to him one day and\r\nannounced that he had determined to appoint Robert T. Lincoln\r\nMinister to England.\r\n\r\nFarwell was extremely angry, and wanted to fight the nomination.\r\nHowever, I counselled moderation.  I pointed out that no criticism\r\ncould be made of Mr. Lincoln, and that since he was my personal\r\nfriend I could not very well oppose him.  So I was glad to favor\r\nthe appointment, although I was as humiliated as my colleague at\r\nthe cool manner with which Harrison had snubbed us after Mr. Blaine's\r\novertures.\r\n\r\nI recollect very well the telegram which Mr. Lincoln received when\r\nhe was in Springfield, attending the business of the Pullman Company.\r\nIt was from his office in Chicago.  It stated that there was a\r\nletter there that demanded immediate attention, and asked whether\r\nit should be forwarded.  He gave instructions to forward it to\r\nSpringfield.  It turned out to be the invitation of General Garfield\r\nto enter his cabinet as Secretary of War, and asking an immediate\r\nreply.  He brought it to me in the Governor's office, where he sat\r\ndown and wrote his reply accepting General Garfield's invitation.\r\n\r\nBut to return to General Garfield.  He was not a strong executive\r\nofficer.  In the brief period in which he occupied the White House,\r\nhe did not make a good President, and in my judgment would never\r\nhave made a good one.  He vacillated in the disposition of his\r\npatronage.  When I visited him while he was yet President-elect,\r\nhe told me that Mr. Conkling would be with him the next day, and\r\nasked my advice as to what he should say to him.  It was understood\r\nthat Conkling was coming to protest against the appointment of\r\nBlaine as Secretary of State.  My advice was to let Mr. Conkling\r\nunderstand that he would appoint whomsoever he pleased as members\r\nof his cabinet; that he would run the office of President without\r\nfear or favor; and that he would appoint Mr. Blaine as Secretary\r\nof State because he considered him the very man best qualified for\r\nthat high office.  Garfield agreed with me, asserting that I had\r\nexpressed exactly what he intended saying to Conkling; but if we\r\nare believe the stories of Senator Conkling's friends, he made far\r\ndifferent promises to Senator Conkling in reference to this as also\r\nto other appointments.\r\n\r\nBut the culmination of the trouble between Garfield and Conkling\r\nwas the appointment of Robertson as Collector of Customs at the\r\nPort of New York.  The President took the ground, for his own\r\nreasons, that the Collector of Customs of New York was a National\r\noffice, in which every State had an interest, and was not to be\r\nconsidered as Senatorial patronage.  Conkling strenuously contended\r\nthat it was exclusively Senatorial patronage, and in this he was\r\nsustained by precedents.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that I was in Washington when the trouble between\r\nConkling and Garfield was at its height, over the appointment of\r\nRobertson.  I called to see the President to pay my respects.  He\r\nasked me if I knew what General Logan would do in reference to the\r\nnomination of Mr. Robertson.  I told him I did not know, and he\r\nasked me if I could find out, and to come to breakfast with him\r\nnext morning.  I did find out that General Logan expected to stand\r\nby the President, and I so reported to him next morning.\r\n\r\nI bade him good-bye and this was the last time that I ever saw him\r\nalive.  I attended his funeral at Cleveland, and as I saw his body\r\nlaid away, I thought of the strange caprice of fate.  Was it\r\npremonition that made him so sad and castdown--so utterly crushed,\r\nas it seemed to me--when he became the Republican candidate for\r\nPresident before that great convention of 1880?  Had he not been\r\nelected President, he would probably have enjoyed a long, useful,\r\nand highly creditable public career.  He would have been one of\r\nthe most distinguished representatives that Ohio ever had in the\r\nupper branch of Congress.  He was to the most eminent degree fitted\r\nfor a legislator.  In the national halls of Congress his public\r\nlife had been spent; there he was at home.  He was not at all fitted\r\nfor the position of Chief Executive of the United States.  And I\r\nsay this not in a spirit of hostility, but in the most kindly way,\r\nbecause I loved General Garfield as one of my earliest friends, in\r\nthose days of long ago, when I served in the Thirty-ninth Congress.\r\n\r\nThere was no man in the Thirty-ninth Congress with whom I was\r\nafterwards so long and intimately associated as I was with the late\r\nSenator William B. Allison of Iowa, with whom I served in the Senate\r\nfor a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nSenator Allison was quite a prominent member of the House when I\r\nentered Congress, and was serving then as a member of the important\r\nWays and Means Committee.  He was regarded as one of the ablest\r\nand most influential of the Western members.\r\n\r\nFrom the very earliest time I knew him, Senator Allison was an\r\nauthority on matters pertaining to finance.  While he was in favor\r\nof a protective tariff, he was not particularly a high-tariff\r\nadvocate; he, and the late General Logan who was then in the House,\r\nand I worked together on tariff matters, as against the high-tariff\r\nadvocates, led by General Schenck.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion we defeated a high-tariff proposition that General\r\nSchenck was advocating.  He was furious, and rising up in his place,\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n\"I might as well move to lay the bill on the table and to write as\r\nits epitaph--'nibbled to death by pismires!'\"\r\n\r\nThe remark made General Logan terribly angry; but Senator Allison,\r\nwho had a quiet, keen sense of humor, and I were very much amused,\r\n--as much at the fury of Logan as at the remark of Schenck.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the House, Senator Allison followed the more radical\r\nelement against President Johnson.  He was much more radical than\r\nI was in those days, and he attacked President Johnson repeatedly\r\non the floor of the House, in tone and manner utterly unlike himself\r\nwhen later he served in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn the upper body he was decidedly a conservative.  He never\r\ncommitted himself until he was absolutely certain.  He was always\r\nregarded as a wise man, and he exercised an extraordinary control\r\nover members, in settling troublesome questions and bringing about\r\nharmony in the Senate.  He had powerful influence, not only with\r\nmembers of his own party, but with members of the opposition.\r\nEvery one had confidence in him.  His statements were accepted\r\nwithout question.  He never attempted oratory, but by cool statement\r\nof facts he moulded the opinions of legislators.  He was one of\r\nthose even tempered, level-headed, sound, sensible men to whom we\r\nnaturally turned when there were difficult questions to settle.\r\n\r\nThere has been no man in our history who had a longer or more\r\ndistinguished public career, and I do not know of any man who was\r\nmore often invited to enter the cabinets of different Presidents\r\nthan was Senator Allison.  The Secretaryship of the Treasury was\r\nurged and almost forced upon him repeatedly.  I visited Indianapolis\r\nto see the President-elect, Mr. Harrison, and it so happened that\r\nSenator Allison and I entered together, Mr. Harrison having sent\r\nfor him.  I saw Harrison first, and he told me that he was going\r\nto ask Senator Allison to become his Secretary of the Treasury.\r\nI assured him that I was confident that he would decline the office\r\n--an assertion that occasioned much surprise, even a display of\r\ntemper.  Mr. Harrison seemed to think that it was Senator Allison's\r\nduty to accept the place.  When Senator Allison saw him a short\r\ntime later, the office was tendered him and he promptly declined\r\nto accept it.  Nothing that Mr. Harrison could do or say would\r\ninduce him to change his mind.\r\n\r\nMr. McKinley was anxious to have Senator Allison in his cabinet,\r\nand I do not think I shall be violating any confidence, now that\r\nthey are both dead, in saying that in declining the appointment\r\nAllison urged McKinley, as he afterwards told me, to appoint me as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, and McKinley gave him so strong an\r\nassurance that he intended to invite me to enter his cabinet, that\r\nwhen Allison saw me in Washington at the beginning of the session,\r\nI being a member of his Committee on Appropriations, he said:\r\n\"Cullom, you are to enter the cabinet; now you will not be able to\r\ndo much work on the Appropriations Committee, and you had better\r\ndevote your time to getting your affairs in shape preparing to\r\nleave the Senate and become Secretary of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nI had urged President McKinley to beg Senator Allison to enter his\r\ncabinet.  Coming from the source that Allison's assurance did, I\r\nnaturally took it more or less seriously, but I did not give the\r\nmatter much thought.\r\n\r\nThe nearest that Mr. McKinley came to inviting me to enter the\r\ncabinet, was an inquiry he made of me, which position I would prefer\r\nin a cabinet, Secretary of State or Secretary of the Treasury.  I\r\nreplied that, personally, I should prefer the Treasury, as I had\r\nat that time no particular interest or training in foreign affairs.\r\nI know now that Mr. McKinley did fully intend to tender to me the\r\nTreasury portfolio, and I also know, but I do not feel at liberty\r\nat this time to reveal, the influence in Illinois which induced\r\nhim to change his mind.  I am very glad now that the position was\r\nnot tendered to me, as I might have accepted it, because of the\r\nknown desire of certain friends in this State to secure my seat in\r\nthe Senate, in which event I should have been long since retired\r\nto private life.\r\n\r\nSenator Allison was the trusted adviser of President after President\r\n--Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, Harrison, McKinley, Roosevelt\r\nall called upon him.  There was no Senator who had to a greater\r\nextent their confidence.  Had he lived he would have been as close,\r\nif not closer to President Taft.  He served in the Senate longer\r\nthan any other man in all our history.  He broke Benton's long\r\nrecord.  He broke the long record of Senator Morrill.  He served\r\neight years in the House and more than thirty-five years in the\r\nSenate, a total of forty-three years and five months in Congress.\r\nFor forty-three years the history of his life embodies the complete\r\nfinancial legislative history of the United States.\r\n\r\nAnother conspicuous member of the Thirty-ninth Congress was Nathaniel\r\nP. Banks of Massachusetts.  He had a long, varied, and interesting\r\ncareer, both in public and private life.  He was many times elected\r\nto Congress from Massachusetts, and in 1856, after a long contest\r\nwhich lasted more than two months, was elected Speaker of the House\r\nof Representatives.  He was Governor of his State, and in 1861,\r\nfor a short time, president of the Illinois Central Railroad, from\r\nwhich position he resigned to enter the Union army as a major-\r\ngeneral, serving throughout the war.\r\n\r\nI did not know him when he was stationed at Chicago but I became\r\nvery well acquainted with him in Congress.  He was Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Affairs, of which committee I was a member.\r\nNot only was General Banks a polite, agreeable man, but he was an\r\nexceptionally effective speaker, and very popular in the House.\r\n\r\nThere occurs to me a little controversy which he had with the late\r\nSenator Dawes, who was at that time a member of the House from\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks was undertaking to pass a bill to which Mr. Dawes\r\nobjected.  Banks was nettled.  Taking the floor, he accused his\r\ncolleague of always objecting to bills he attempted to pass.  Dawes\r\narose in his place, and in the most ponderous fashion, turned to\r\nBanks.\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to my colleague,\" he asked, \"when did I ever before object\r\nto any bill which he was attempting to pass?\"\r\n\r\nBanks jumped to his feet, and said in his high-pitched voice:  \"I\r\ndo not know that my colleague ever did, but I always thought that\r\nhe was just about to.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks served during the six years that I was a member of\r\nthe House, and several terms afterwards, his public service ending\r\nwith the Fifty-first Congress.  He died at his home in Massachusetts,\r\nin 1894.\r\n\r\nDaniel W. Voorhees was another celebrated member of the Thirty-\r\nninth Congress, and was later a Senator from Indiana.  Senator\r\nVoorhees was a very able man and a zealous, consistent Democrat.\r\nHe was charged, and I have no doubt at all that it was true, with\r\nbeing a Rebel sympathizer, and a prominent member of the Knights\r\nof the Golden Circle.  A fine, gifted speaker, a kind-hearted\r\ngentleman, he was very popular with the people of Indiana.  Dan\r\nVoorhees and Thomas A. Hendricks, who was afterward Vice-President\r\nof the United States, were the two most prominent Democrats of\r\nIndiana in all its history, and indeed were two of the foremost\r\nDemocrats of the North.\r\n\r\nSenator Voorhees' seat, as a member of the House in the Thirty-\r\nninth Congress, was successfully contested; and I can see him now,\r\nwith his imposing presence, making his final speech in the House,\r\nafter the result of the contest had become known.  Garbed in a long\r\ncloak, he defended his right to his seat with the greatest dignity.\r\nThe vote was taken; his opponent was seated; then he drew his cloak\r\nabout him, and with the air of a king, walked out of the House,\r\nalmost triumphantly.  I had voted against him, but the dignity with\r\nwhich he carried off the occasion certainly commanded my deepest\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nHe was a great admirer of Mr. Lincoln.  He knew him well; had been\r\nassociated with him in many lawsuits on the circuit, at Danville,\r\nand in the eastern part of the State; and although they belonged\r\nto opposing political parties, he evinced for Lincoln a very warm\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nSenator Voorhees once told me a rather interesting story in connection\r\nwith President Lincoln.  It was the occasion of the dedication of\r\nwhat was known as the Foundery Methodist Church in Washington.\r\nMr. Lincoln was present, Voorhees was there, and Bishop Simpson\r\ndelivered the dedicatory address.  The bishop was an eloquent\r\nspeaker and his sermon was a characteristic one.  The President\r\nwas seated in an armchair in front of the pulpit, with his back to\r\nthe minister, and after the sermon was over, an effort was at once\r\nmade to raise funds to pay the debt of the church.  This phase of\r\nthe meeting was tiresomely protracted, the minister, in the customary\r\nstyle, earnestly urging an unresponsive congregation to contribute\r\nuntil nearly every inducement had been exhausted.  Finally someone\r\nstarted a movement to raise a certain definite amount of money,\r\nthe achievement of which would make the President a life member of\r\nsome church society.  But even this scheme was not accepted with\r\nmuch enthusiasm, and Bishop Simpson renewed his plea for donations.\r\nAt last Mr. Lincoln, who had been growing tired and bored at the\r\nperformance, craned his head around toward Bishop Simpson, and said\r\nin a tone that everybody heard:  \"Simpson, if you will stop this\r\nauction I will pay the money myself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd since Bishop Simpson's name has been mentioned, another incident\r\nin which he figured is suggested, which might as well be related\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIn the Methodist Church Bishop Simpson's name is a household word.\r\nHe was one of its most prominent divines, and in sympathy with that\r\nbranch which remained loyal to the Union.  Naturally he was a great\r\nadmirer of Mr. Lincoln--in fact, so close was he to the President\r\nthat it was his influence that secured the appointment of Senator\r\nHarlan of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior.  What follows will\r\ndemonstrate that this statement is not made on hearsay.\r\n\r\nSeveral prominent men of Illinois, and other parts of the country,\r\nwere in Washington trying to secure the appointment of Uncle Jesse\r\nK. Dubois (the father of Senator Dubois of Idaho who served in the\r\nUnited States Senate two terms with great credit to himself and\r\nState), as Secretary of the Interior.  Uncle Jesse Dubois was there\r\nhimself, and we all met one evening at the National Hotel, at which\r\nmeeting I was designated to go to the White House and use my\r\ninfluence with President Lincoln in Uncle Jesse's behalf.  Uncle\r\nJesse had no business coming to Washington when he was being pushed\r\nfor a cabinet office; but he did, nevertheless, and he was not in\r\ngood health.  About ten o'clock at night I saw the President, and\r\nlaid before him Uncle Jesse's claims.  His reply was:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot appoint him.  I must appoint Senator Harlan.  I promised\r\nBishop Simpson to do so.  The Methodist Church has been standing\r\nby me very generally; I agreed with Bishop Simpson to give Senator\r\nHarlan this place, and I must keep my agreement.  I would like to\r\ntake care of Uncle Jesse, but I do not see that I can as a member\r\nof my cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nI replied:  \"If you have determined it, that is the end of the\r\nmatter, and I shall so report to the friends who are gathered at\r\nthe National, so that Uncle Jesse may go on home.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln seemed much affected.  He followed me to the\r\ndoor, repeating that he would like to take care of Uncle Jesse,\r\nbut could not do so.\r\n\r\nJesse Dubois went home to Springfield, but he remained as stanch\r\na friend to Lincoln as ever, and was one of the committee sent from\r\nSpringfield to accompany the remains of the immortal President to\r\ntheir last resting-place.\r\n\r\nGeorge S. Boutwell was another member of the Thirty-ninth Congress\r\nwho merits some attention.  He afterward became very influential\r\namong the radical element, and was one of the managers on the part\r\nof the House in the impeachment of President Johnson.  It is hard\r\nto understand in a man of his sober, sound sense; but I am convinced\r\nthat he firmly believed President Johnson to have been a conspirator\r\nin securing the assassination of Mr. Lincoln.  He was Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury under President Grant, who had for him the greatest\r\nrespect and confidence.  I never was very intimate with him, but\r\nI knew him fairly well, and considered him one of the leading public\r\nmen of Massachusetts of his day.\r\n\r\nOne of the leading members of the Pennsylvania delegation in the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress was William D. Kelley.  He was a prominent\r\nmember of the House, a good speaker, although he always prepared\r\nhis addresses at great length, principally on the tariff; but he\r\ndid not confine himself to his manuscripts entirely.  His specialty\r\nin Congress was the tariff.  He was called \"Pig-iron Kelley\" because\r\nhe was for high duties on pig-iron and, in fact, everything\r\nmanufactured in Pennsylvania.  That State, as everybody knows, is\r\nthe great iron and steel manufacturing State of the Union, and its\r\nrepresentatives in Congress were in that day, as they are in this,\r\nthe highest of high protective tariff advocates.\r\n\r\nBefore entering Congress, William D. Kelley for a number of years\r\nhad been a judge of one of the more important courts of Philadelphia.\r\nHe was elected to and kept in the House, without any particular\r\neffort on his own part, because he was considered one of the most\r\nvaluable men in Congress in matters pertaining to the tariff.  When\r\nI was a candidate for re-election to the House he visited my district\r\nand made several very able speeches for me at my request, and, with\r\nhis wife, was my guest in Springfield for several days.  At that\r\ntime Republicans were for a high protective tariff, and it was not\r\nconsidered then, as it seems to be in these days of so-called\r\ninsurgency, a crime for a Republican to stand up and say that he\r\nwas in favor of high tariff duties.  In any event, Judge Kelley\r\ndid me much good in the speeches he made in my district.\r\n\r\nWe occupied apartments in the same house in Washington--on F Street\r\nnear the Ebbitt House, at which hotel we took our meals.  F Street\r\nis now the heart of the business centre, but it was then one of\r\nthe principal residence streets, and many Representatives and\r\nSenators lived in that vicinity.  The only objection I had to living\r\nin the same house with Judge Kelley was that he was always preparing\r\nspeeches, and when he got ready to deliver a speech he would insist\r\non reading it all over to me; and as his speeches were generally\r\ntwo or three hours long, and always on the tariff, in which I did\r\nnot take an extraordinary amount of interest, I became pretty tired\r\nof hearing them.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion when he was making quite an eloquent speech in the\r\nHouse, he was interrupted by a member from Kentucky, whose name I\r\ndo not remember.  He had already answered him once or twice and\r\nthen gone on.  He was interrupted again, and this time he answered:\r\n\"Oh, don't interrupt me when the glow is on.\"  The \"glow\" did happen\r\nto be on at that time, and naturally he did not desire to be\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIn the same Pennsylvania delegation there were two members named\r\nCharles O'Neill and Leonard Myers, who were very short in stature.\r\nFor some reason or other, some wag dubbed them \"Kelley's ponies.\"\r\nThey heard of it and became very angry, and on every occasion, when\r\nthere was half a chance, they watched to see how Judge Kelley voted\r\nand would then vote the opposite.\r\n\r\nThey were both good men and good Republicans, and O'Neill served\r\nthe same number of terms as Judge Kelley--fifteen--but O'Neill\r\nremained his full fifteen terms and retired from Congress.  Judge\r\nKelley was serving his fifteenth term when he died in Washington, in\r\n1890.\r\n\r\nSamuel J. Randall was one of the prominent Democrats of his day;\r\nbut strange to say he favored a protective tariff.  He also served\r\nabout fifteen terms, two of them in the Speaker's chair.  He had\r\nan anxious solicitude for the success of his party, and made many\r\npolitical speeches.  He was a young member when I first knew him,\r\naway back in the sixties, but even then he occupied an influential\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nI remember meeting him in Mr. Blaine's office one day, when the\r\nlatter was Secretary of State, and Mr. Blaine not being in, we sat\r\non the settee and had a talk.  He was in poor health, but curious\r\nrespecting the relations between President Harrison and his party.\r\nI told him they were not getting along very well; that he satisfied\r\nhis party about as well as Mr. Cleveland satisfied his when he was\r\nin the White House.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he observed, \"he is better than our President.  We never\r\ncould do much with Cleveland.\"  Then he added this characteristic\r\nremark:  \"If you want an army to fight, you must feed it.  It is\r\nthe same with a political party:  if a party is to take care of\r\nitself, its workers must be recognized in the distribution of its\r\npatronage.\"\r\n\r\nI never saw Samuel J. Randall afterwards.\r\n\r\nJudge Godlove S. Orth was one of my most intimate friends in the\r\nHouse of Representatives.  He was a splendid man, and was regarded\r\nas an honorable and able member.  He and I saw much of each other\r\nevery day, as we roomed in the same neighborhood and generally\r\nvisited the departments together.  We were seen with each other so\r\noften on the streets, in fact, that when we were separated, friends\r\nwould ask either one or the other of us:  \"What has become of your\r\npartner?\"  At one time I canvassed his district for him and he was\r\nre-elected.\r\n\r\nHe had a peculiar name, \"Godlove.\"  I never heard of a man named\r\nGodlove, either before or since.  The story was told of a lady\r\nsitting in the gallery, listening to the proceedings of the House.\r\nShe could not hear very well.  When the roll was being called, and\r\nshe heard the name \"Godlove\" called by the clerk, she did not\r\nunderstand it; she wend down stairs and told her friends that the\r\nHouse of Representatives was a most pious body; that every time\r\nthey called the roll, and the clerk got about half way through, he\r\nwould stop and exclaim:  \"God love us all!\"\r\n\r\nJudge Orth has been dead for many years, but I have always remembered\r\nwith great pleasure our friendship when we served as colleagues in\r\nthe House, nearly half a century ago.\r\n\r\nOakes Ames of Boston was a prominent member of the House.  He had\r\ncharge of the Union Pacific Railroad construction, and it was\r\ncharged--and proven, I believe, afterwards--that he secured the\r\nconcessions for the railroad by undue influence,--the use of money,\r\ngifts of stock, etc.,--and the whole thing finally culminated in\r\nwhat is known as the _Crédit Mobilier_ scandal, the exposure of\r\nwhich came after I retired from the House.\r\n\r\nAmes was a member of the Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth,\r\nForty-first, and Forty-second Congresses, and I knew him very well\r\nduring my six years' service.  I was made chairman of the Committee\r\non Territories in the Forty-first Congress, by Mr. Blaine, who was\r\nthen Speaker.  Ames annoyed me very much by coming to me almost\r\nevery day in the interest of legislation in the Territories affecting\r\nthe Union Pacific, and I asked him one day, being a little out of\r\ntemper, whether he was so absorbed in the Pacific Railroad that he\r\nhad not time to devote to anything else.  He made some light\r\nrejoinder; sometime later the exposure came, and I found that he\r\nwas engaged in most unfortunate and unlawful practices in securing\r\nlegislation in the interest of his road.\r\n\r\nI never believed that Oakes Ames was naturally a dishonest man,\r\nbut the proof was against him, and the scandal resulted in his\r\ndeath, as it also did in the death of James Brooks, of New York,\r\nand the ruination of other public men.\r\n\r\nI knew S. S. Cox (\"Sunset\" Cox, as he was called), as a member of\r\nthe Forty-first Congress.  He had served in some previous Congress\r\nas a member from Ohio; but when I knew him he was serving as a\r\nmember from New York.\r\n\r\nCox was an able man, as a speaker, a writer, and a diplomat.  He\r\nwas always listened to with great respect and attention when he\r\naddressed the House, but a considerable amount of fun was poked at\r\nhim after a certain occasion when he had interrupted General Butler\r\na time or two in debate, and the General, finally losing patience,\r\nreplied to one of his questions with the admonition:  \"Shoo, fly,\r\ndon't bodder me!\"  I was present at the time; the galleries were\r\nfilled, as they always were in those days; and when General Butler\r\nuttered this reproof the whole House, galleries, and floor, was in\r\nan uproar, maintaining the confusion for some minutes.  When it\r\nseemed like subsiding, it would break out again and again, and so\r\nit continued for quite a while.  When order was finally restored\r\nCox undertook to reply; but he could not do so.  He had been so\r\ncrippled by the response of the audience to Butler's remark that\r\nhe never recovered from it.\r\n\r\nCox was a splendid man.  He always thought in those days that he\r\nhad not been quite appreciated by his friends in the Democratic\r\nparty, and they thought the same way; but he was so good-humored,\r\nand such a whole-souled man and so fond of wit that he really never\r\ndid get what he was entitled to.\r\n\r\nI was trying to pass a bill which I had prepared for the purpose\r\nof prohibiting and wiping out polygamy in Utah.  I had reported\r\nthe bill from the Committee on Territories, and I was doing my best\r\nto pass it.  For some reason or other (afterwards I learned it was\r\nan ulterior reason to help out a friend), General Schenck undertook\r\nto defeat the measure, and for this purpose he asked to have it\r\nreferred to the Committee on Judiciary.  This committee probably\r\nhad jurisdiction over the subject; I did not think so at the time,\r\nand believed that such a reference would kill the bill.  He seemed\r\nto be making some headway with the Republicans, when Cox came over\r\nto me from the Democratic side of the House, and proposed that if\r\nI would yield to him for five minutes he would help me to pass the\r\nbill.  I told him to go back to his seat and that I would yield to\r\nhim directly.  When I did Cox took the floor, and to my utter\r\nastonishment he denounced the bill as the most outrageous bill that\r\nhad ever been brought before the House, declaring in the most\r\nspirited manner that of course it ought to be referred to the\r\nJudiciary Committee, because every one knew that such a reference\r\nwould kill it.\r\n\r\nBut he was shrewder than I apprehended at the moment.  His talk\r\nhad the desired effect, for the Republicans who had been following\r\nSchneck determined that they would not be responsible for killing\r\nthe bill; they came back to me, and the measure was passed through\r\nthe House by a substantial majority.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON\r\n1865\r\n\r\nAs I look back now over the vista of years that have come and gone,\r\nit seems to me that I entered the Lower House of Congress just at\r\nthe beginning of the most important period in all our history.\r\nThe great President had been assassinated; the war was over; Andrew\r\nJohnson, a Union Democrat, was President of the United States.\r\nReconstruction was the problem which confronted us, how to heal up\r\nthe Nation's wounds and remake a Union which would endure for all\r\ntime to come.  These were the difficult conditions that had to be\r\ndealt with by the Thirty-ninth Congress.\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson was the queerest character that ever occupied the\r\nWhite House, and, with the exception of Lincoln only, he entered\r\nit under the most trying and difficult circumstances in all our\r\nhistory; but Lincoln had, what Johnson lacked, the support and\r\nconfidence of the great Republican party.  Johnson was never a\r\nRepublican, and never pretended to be one.  He was a lifelong\r\nDemocrat, and a slave-holder as well; but he was loyal to the Union,\r\nno man living more so.  As a Senator from Tennessee, alone of all\r\nthe Southern Senators he faced his colleagues from the South in\r\ndenouncing secession as treason.  His subsequent phenomenal course\r\nin armed opposition to the rebellion brought about his nomination\r\nfor the Vice-Presidency as a shrewd stroke to secure the support\r\nof the War Democrats of the North and the Union men of his State\r\nand section.\r\n\r\nHe came to the Presidency under the cloud of President Lincoln's\r\nassassination, when the majority of the North believed that a\r\nSouthern conspiracy had laid the great President low.  The seceding\r\nStates hated him as a traitor to his own section; the North distrusted\r\nhim as a Democrat.  At first I believe the very radical element of\r\nthe Republican party in Congress, led by old Ben Wade of Ohio, than\r\nwhom there was no more unsafe man in either house of Congress, were\r\ndisposed, if not openly to rejoice, which they dared not do, to\r\nsee with some secret satisfaction the entrance of Johnson into the\r\nWhite House.  It is well known that Wade did say in his first\r\ninterview with President Johnson, when, as a member of the committee\r\non the conduct of the war, he waited on him, \"Johnson, we have\r\nfaith in you.  By the gods, there will be no more trouble in\r\nrunning the Government.\"\r\n\r\nI have already, in another chapter, described the scene which took\r\nplace in the Senate chamber when Johnson was inducted into office\r\nas Vice-President; the exhibition he made of himself at the time\r\nof taking the oath of office, in the presence of the President of\r\nthe United States and the representatives of the Governments of\r\nthe world.  All this, advertised at the time in the opposition\r\npress, added to the prejudice against Johnson in the North and made\r\nhis position more trying and difficult.\r\n\r\nThere were two striking points in Johnson's character, and I knew\r\nhim well:  First, his loyalty to the Union; and, second, his utter\r\nfearlessness of character.  He could not be cowed; old Ben Wade,\r\nSumner, Stevens, all the great leaders of that day could not,\r\nthrough fear, influence him one particle.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, when he was being made the target of all sorts of threats\r\non account of his solitary stand against secession in the Senate,\r\nhe let fall this characteristic utterance:\r\n\r\n\"I want to say, not boastingly, with no anger in my bosom, that\r\nthese two eyes of mine have never looked upon anything in the shape\r\nof mortal man that this heart has feared.\"\r\n\r\nThis utterance probably illustrates Johnson's character more clearly\r\nthan anything that I could say.  He sought rather than avoided a\r\nfight.  Headstrong, domineering, having fought his way in a State\r\nfilled with aristocratic Southerners, from the class of so-called\r\n\"low whites\" to the highest position in the United States, he did\r\nnot readily yield to the dictates of the dominating forces in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nLincoln had a well-defined policy of reconstruction.  Indeed, so\r\nliberal was he disposed to be in his treatment of the Southern\r\nStates, that immediately after the surrender of Richmond he would\r\nhave recognized the old State Government of Virginia had it not\r\nbeen for the peremptory veto of Stanton.  Congress was not in\r\nsession when Johnson came to the Presidency in April, 1865.  To do\r\nhim no more than simple justice, I firmly believe that he wanted\r\nto follow out, in reconstruction, what he thought was the policy\r\nof Mr. Lincoln, and in this he was guided largely by the advice of\r\nMr. Seward.\r\n\r\nBut there was this difference.  Johnson was, probably in good faith,\r\npursuing the Lincoln policy of reconstruction; but when the\r\nLegislatures and Executives of the Southern States began openly\r\npassing laws and executing them so that the negro was substantially\r\nplaced back into slavery, practically nullifying the results of\r\nthe awful struggle, the untold loss of life and treasure, Mr.\r\nLincoln certainly would have receded and would have dealt with the\r\nSouth with an iron hand, as Congress had determined to do, and as\r\nGeneral Grant was compelled to do when he assumed the Presidency.\r\n\r\nFrom April to the reassembling of Congress in December, Johnson\r\nhad a free hand in dealing with the seceded States, and he was not\r\nslow to take advantage of it.  He seemed disposed to recognize the\r\nold State Governments; to restrict the suffrage to the whites; to\r\nexercise freely the pardoning power in the way of extending executive\r\nclemency not only to almost all classes, but to every individual\r\nwho would apply for it.  The result was, it seemed to be certain\r\nthat if the Johnson policy were carried out to the fullest extent,\r\nthe supremacy of the Republican party in the councils of the Nation\r\nwould be at stake.\r\n\r\nTo express it in a word, the motive of the opposition to the Johnson\r\nplan of reconstruction was the firm conviction that its success\r\nwould wreck the Republican party, and by restoring the Democrats\r\nto power bring back Southern supremacy and Northern vassalage.\r\nThe impeachment, in a word, was the culmination of the struggle\r\nbetween the legislative and the executive departments of the\r\nGovernment over the problem of reconstruction.  The legislative\r\ndepartment claimed exclusive jurisdiction over reconstruction; the\r\nexecutive claimed that it alone was competent to deal with the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThis is a very brief summary of the conditions which confronted us\r\nwhen I entered the Thirty-ninth Congress.  Representatives of the\r\neleven seceding States were there to claim their seats in Congress.\r\nThe Republican members met in caucus the Saturday evening preceding\r\nthe meeting of Congress on Monday.  I, as a member-elect, was\r\npresent, and I remember how old Thaddeus Stevens at once assumed\r\nthe dominating control in opposition to the President's plan.\r\nStevens was a most remarkable character,--one of the most remarkable\r\nin the legislative history of the United States.  He believed firmly\r\nin negro equality and negro suffrage.  As one writer eloquently\r\nexpresses it:\r\n\r\n\"According to his creed, the insurgent States were conquered\r\nprovinces to be shaped into a paradise for the freedman and a hell\r\nfor the rebel.  His eye shot over the blackened southern land; he\r\nsaw the carnage, the desolation, the starvation, and the shame;\r\nand like a battered old warhorse, he flung up his frontlet, sniffed\r\nthe tainted breeze, and snorted 'Ha, Ha!'\"\r\n\r\nIt was at once determined by the Republican majority in Congress\r\nthat the representatives of the eleven seceding States should not\r\nbe admitted.  The Constitution expressly gives to the House and\r\nSenate the exclusive power to judge of the admission and qualification\r\nof its own members.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised at the moderation of the President's message,\r\nwhich came in on Tuesday after Congress assembled.  In tone and\r\ngeneral character the message was wholly unlike Johnson.  It was\r\nan admirable state document, one of the finest from a literary and\r\nprobably from every other standpoint that ever came from an Executive\r\nto Congress.  It was thought at the time that Mr. Seward wrote it,\r\nbut it has since been asserted that it was the product of that\r\nforemost of American historians, J. C. Bancroft, one of Mr. Johnson's\r\nclose personal friends.\r\n\r\nThere existed three theories of dealing with the Southern States:\r\none was the President's theory of recognizing the State Governments,\r\nallowing the States to deal with the suffrage question as they\r\nmight see fit; the Stevens policy of wiping out all State lines\r\nand dealing with the regions as conquered military provinces; and\r\nthe Sumner theory of treating them as organized territories,\r\nrecognizing the State lines.\r\n\r\nJohnson dealt in a masterful manner with the subject in his message.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\"States, with proper limitations of power, are essential to the\r\nexistence of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The perpetuity of the Constitution bring with it the perpetuity\r\nof the States; their mutual relations makes us what we are, and in\r\nour political system this connection is indissoluble.  The whole\r\ncannot exist without the parts nor the parts without the whole.\r\nSo long as the Constitution of the United States endures, the States\r\nwill endure; the destruction of the one is the destruction of the\r\nother; the preservation of the one is the preservation of the other.\r\n\r\n\"The true theory is that all pretended acts of secession were, from\r\nthe beginning, null and void.  The States cannot commit treason,\r\nnor screen the individual citizens who may have committed treason,\r\nany more than they can make valid treaties or engage in lawful\r\ncommerce with any foreign power.  The States attempting to secede\r\nplaced themselves in a condition where their vitality was impaired\r\nbut not extinguished, their functions suspended but not destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nIt was but the Johnson theory which we presented to the world,\r\ndenying the right of any State to secede; asserting the perpetuity,\r\nthe indissolubility of the Union.\r\n\r\nBut the question was, whether the members from the seceding States\r\nshould be admitted to the Senate and House; and he dealt with this\r\nmost difficult problem in a statesmanlike way.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"The amendment to the Constitution being adopted, it would remain\r\nfor the States whose powers have been so long in abeyance, to resume\r\ntheir places in the two branches of the National Legislature, and\r\nthereby complete the work of restoration.  Here it is for you,\r\nfellow citizens of the Senate, and for you, fellow citizens of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, to judge, each of you for yourselves, of\r\nthe elections, returns and qualifications of your own members.\"\r\n\r\nOn the suffrage question, he said:\r\n\r\n\"On the propriety of making freedmen electors by proclamation of\r\nthe Executive, I took for my counsel the Constitution itself, the\r\ninterpretations of that instrument by its authors, and their\r\ncontemporaries, and the recent legislation of Congress.  They all\r\nunite in inculcating the doctrine that the regulation of the suffrage\r\nis a power exclusively for the States.  So fixed was this reservation\r\nof power in the habits of the people, and so unquestioned has been\r\nthe interpretation of the Constitution, that during the Civil War\r\nthe late President never harbored the purpose,--certainly never\r\navowed it,--of disregarding it; and in acts of Congress nothing\r\ncan be found to sanction any departure by the Executive from a\r\npolicy which has so uniformly obtained.\"\r\n\r\nAside from the worst radicals, the message pleased every one, the\r\ncountry at large and the majority in Congress; and there was a\r\ngeneral disposition to give the President a reasonably free hand\r\nin working out his plan of reconstruction.  But as I stated, the\r\nLegislatures of the Southern States and their Executives assumed\r\nso domineering an attitude, practically wiping out the results of\r\nthe war, that the Republican majority in Congress assumed it to be\r\nits duty to take control from the Executive.\r\n\r\nWhat determined Johnson in his course, I do not know.  It was\r\nthought that he would be a radical of radicals.  Being of the \"poor\r\nwhite\" class, he may have been flattered by the attentions showered\r\non him by the old Southern aristocrats.  Writers of this period\r\nhave frequently given that as a reason.  My own belief has been\r\nthat he was far too strong a man to be governed in so vital a matter\r\nby so trivial a cause.  My conviction is that the radical Republican\r\nleaders in the House were right; that he believed in the old\r\nDemocratic party, aside from his loyalty to the Union; and was a\r\nDemocrat determined to turn the Government over to the Democratic\r\nparty, reconstructed on a Union basis.\r\n\r\nI cannot undertake to go into all the long details of the memorable\r\nstruggle.  As I look back over the history of it now, it seems to\r\nme to bear a close resemblance to the beginning of the French\r\nRevolution, to the struggle between the States General of France\r\nand Louis XVI.  Might we not, if things had turned differently,\r\ndrifted into chaos and revolution?  If Johnson had been impeached\r\nand refused to submit, adopting the same tactics as did Stanton in\r\nretaining the War Department; had Ben Wade taken the oath of office\r\nand demanded possession, Heaven only knows what might have been\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nBut reminiscing in this way, as I cannot avoid doing when I think\r\nback over those terrible times, I lose the continuity of my subject.\r\n\r\nAn extension to the Freedman's Bureau bill was passed, was promptly\r\nvetoed by the Executive, the veto was as promptly overruled by the\r\nHouse, where there was no substantial opposition, but the Senate\r\nfailed to pass the bill, the veto of the President to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\nI had not the remotest idea that Johnson would dare to veto the\r\nFreedman's Bureau bill, and I made a speech on the subject, declaring\r\na firm conviction to that effect.  A veto at that time was almost\r\nunheard of.  Except during the administration of Tyler, no important\r\nbill had ever been vetoed by an Executive.  It came as a shock to\r\nCongress and the country.  Excitement reigned supreme.  The question\r\nwas:  \"Should the bill pass the veto of the President regardless\r\nthereof?\"\r\n\r\nNot the slightest difficulty existed in the House; Thaddeus Stevens\r\nhad too complete control of that body to allow any question concerning\r\nit there.  The bill, therefore, was promptly passed over the veto\r\nof the President.\r\n\r\nBut the situation in the Senate was different.  At this time the\r\nSumner-Wade radical element did not have the necessary two-thirds\r\nmajority, and the bill failed to pass over the veto of the President.\r\nThe war between the executive and legislative departments of the\r\nGovernment had fairly commenced, and the first victory had been\r\nwon by the President.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Rights bill, drawn and introduced by Judge Trumbull, than\r\nwhom there was no greater lawyer in the United States Senate, in\r\nJanuary, 1866, on the reassembling of Congress, was passed.  Then\r\nbegan the real struggle on the part of the radicals in the Senate,\r\nheaded by Sumner and Wade, to muster the necessary two-thirds\r\nmajority to pass a bill over the veto of the President.\r\n\r\nLet me digress here to say a word in reference to Charles Sumner.\r\nFor ten years he was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee\r\nof the United States Senate, and no man, by education, experience,\r\nknowledge of world politics, and travel, was ever more fitted to\r\noccupy that high position.  He was one of the most cultivated men\r\nof his day, a radical, and filled one of the most important places\r\nin the history of his time.  When he entered the Senate, the South\r\ndominated this Government; the great triumvirate, Webster, Clay,\r\nand Calhoun, had just passed.  The day he entered, Clay for the\r\nlast time, feeble, emaciated, appeared on the Senate floor.\r\nCompromise was the word, and the Southerners so dominated that it\r\nwas considered treason to mention the slavery question.  Charles\r\nSumner was an abolitionist; he was not afraid, and at the very\r\nfirst opportunity he took the floor and denounced the institution\r\nin no unmeasured terms.  Chase and Seward were present that day,\r\nand quickly followed Sumner's lead.  Seward, however, was far more\r\nconservative than either Sumner or Chase.\r\n\r\nIt was the mission of Charles Sumner to awake the public conscience\r\nto the horrors of slavery.  He performed his duty unfalteringly,\r\nand it almost cost him his life.  Mr. Lincoln was the only man\r\nliving who ever managed Charles Sumner, or could use him for his\r\npurpose.  Sumner's end has always seemed to me most pitiful.\r\nRemoved from his high position as chairman of the Foreign Relations\r\nCommittee of the Senate, followed relentlessly by the enmity of\r\nPresident Grant, than at the very acme of his fame; drifting from\r\nthe Republican party, his own State repudiating him, Charles Sumner\r\ndied of a broken heart.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the struggle between the President and Congress.\r\nTrumbull, Sumner, Wade, and the leaders were bound in one way or\r\nanother to get the necessary two-thirds.  The vote was taken in\r\nthe Senate:  \"Shall the Civil Rights bill pass the veto of the\r\nPresident to the contrary notwithstanding?\"  It was well understood\r\nthat the vote would be very close, and the result uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe excitement was intense.  The galleries were crowded; members\r\nof the House were on the Senate floor.  The result seemed to depend\r\nentirely upon the vote of Senator Morgan, of New York, and he seemed\r\nto be irresolute, uncertain in his own mind which way he would\r\nvote.  The call of the roll proceeded.  When his name was reached\r\nthere was profound silence.  He first voted nay, and then immediately\r\nchanged to yea.  A wonderful demonstration burst forth as it was\r\nthen known that the bill would pass over the veto of the President,\r\nand that the Republican party in Congress at last had complete\r\ncontrol.  Senator Trumbull made a remarkable speech on that occasion,\r\nand I was never prouder of any living man.\r\n\r\nSo the struggle went on from day to day and year to year, growing\r\nall the time more intense.  I have always been disposed to be\r\nconservative; I was then; and it was with profound regret that I\r\nsaw the feeling between the President and Congress becoming more\r\nand more strained.\r\n\r\nI disliked to follow the extreme radical element, and when the row\r\nwas at its height, Judge Orth, a colleague in the House from Indiana,\r\nand I concluded to go and see the President and advise with him,\r\nin an attempt to smooth over the differences.  I will never forget\r\nthat interview.  It was at night.  He received us politely enough,\r\nand without mincing any words he gave us to understand that we were\r\non a fool's errand and that he would not yield.  We went away, and\r\nnaturally joined the extreme radicals in the House, always voting\r\nwith them afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe row continued in the Fortieth Congress.  Bills were passed,\r\npromptly vetoed, and the bills immediately passed over the President's\r\nveto.  Many of the bills were not only unwise legislation but were\r\nunconstitutional as well.  We passed the Tenure of Office bill; we\r\nattempted to restrict the President's pardoning power; and as I\r\nlook back over the history of the period, it seems to me that we\r\ndid not have the slightest regard for the Constitution.  Some of\r\nPresident Johnson' veto messages were admirable.  He had the advice\r\nand assistance of one of the ablest lawyers of his day, Jeremiah\r\nBlack.\r\n\r\nTo make the feeling more intense, just about this time Johnson made\r\nhis famous \"swing around the circle,\" as it was termed.  His speeches\r\npublished in the opposition press were intemperate and extreme.\r\nHe denounced Congress.  He threatened to \"kick people out of office,\"\r\nin violation of the Tenure of Office act.  He was undignified in\r\nhis actions and language, and many people thought he was intoxicated\r\nmost of the time, although I do not believe this.\r\n\r\nThe radicals in both the House and Senate determined that he should\r\nbe impeached and removed from office.  They had the votes in the\r\nHouse easily, and they thought they could muster the necessary\r\nnumber in the Senate, as we had been passing all sorts of legislation\r\nover the President's veto.  When the subject was up, I was doubtful,\r\nand I really believe, strong Republican that I was, that had it\r\nnot been for Judge Trumbull I would have voted against the impeachment\r\narticles.  I advised with the Judge, for whom I had profound respect.\r\nI visited him at his house.  I explained to him my doubts, and I\r\nrecall very clearly the expression he used in reply.  He said:\r\n\"Johnson is an obstruction to the Government and should be removed.\"\r\nJudge Trumbull himself changed afterwards, much to the astonishment\r\nof every one, and denounced the impeachment proceeding as unworthy\r\nof a justice of the peace court.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me difficult to realize that it was as far back as\r\nMarch 2, 1868, that I addressed the House in favor of the impeachment\r\narticles.  I think I made a pretty good speech on that occasion\r\nand supported my position very well.  I took rather an extreme view\r\nin favor of the predominance of the legislative department of the\r\nGovernment, contending that the executive and judiciary departments\r\nof the Government, while they are finally responsible to the people,\r\nare directly accountable to the legislative department.\r\n\r\nThe first and principal article in the impeachment proposed by the\r\nHouse was the President's issuance of an order removing Edwin M.\r\nStanton as Secretary of War, he having been duly appointed and\r\ncommissioned by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and\r\nthe Senate having been in session at the time of his removal.\r\n\r\nI contended then, on the floor of the House, that such a removal\r\nwas a violation of the Constitution and could not be excused on\r\nany pretext whatever, in addition to being a direct violation of\r\nthe Tenure of Office act.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to go into the details of the various articles\r\nproposed by the House; suffice it to say that they were mainly\r\nbased on the attempted removal of Mr. Stanton, and the appointment\r\nof Mr. Thomas as Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nI was very serious in concluding my speech.  My words were:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman:  The administration of Mr. Johnson since he became\r\nPresident of the United States has been characterized by an utter\r\ndisregard of the laws and Constitution of the United States.  And,\r\nsir, I am of the opinion that there should be another article\r\nadopted by this House, and sent to the Senate, upon which he should\r\nbe tried, the substance of which should be that Andrew Johnson,\r\nPresident of the United States, is guilty of high crimes in office,\r\nin that he violated the Constitution and laws of the United States,\r\nby using his influence, patronage and power of said office to\r\nhinder, delay and prevent a restoration of the States lately in\r\nrebellion against the Government, to their proper practical relations\r\nto the Union.  Congress provided by law for the reconstruction of\r\nthe rebel States.  The President, from whatever motives it matters\r\nnot, stands in his Executive Office, and by all his influence and\r\npower opposes restoration according to law.  As an Executive Officer,\r\nhe has no such right, and his opposition to the laws of Congress\r\non the subject of reconstruction has cost this Nation thousands of\r\nloyal men who have been murdered in the South on account of their\r\ndevotion to the Flag, and millions of money which is to be added\r\nto the enormous public debt to be cast upon the necks of the people.\r\nShall the Nation endure it longer?  Shall we struggle on and on\r\nuntil the welcome day comes when his term shall expire?  The people\r\nsay 'No'; men struggling in business say 'No'; men longing for\r\npeace and harmony in the land say 'No'; the loyal men of the South,\r\nwho have been abused and hunted by wicked rebels, say 'No'; and I\r\ntrust that the answer of all these may be the answer of this House\r\nto-day, and the answer of the Senate of the United States within\r\na reasonable time after these articles shall be sent to them.\"\r\n\r\nNeedless for me to say, that as the subject continued feeling\r\nremained at a high pitch in the House.  It was debated from day to\r\nday.  Stevens was urging the impeachment with all the force at his\r\ncommand; some were doubtful and holding back, as I was; some changed\r\n--for instance, James G. Blaine, who was taunted by Stevens and\r\nsneered at for his change of front.\r\n\r\nUnder the law then existing the President of the Senate succeeded\r\na Vice-President who became, by the death or removal of the President,\r\nPresident of the United States.  The radicals in complete control\r\n--and I have no doubt that Stevens had a hand in it--elected the\r\nmost radical of their number as President of the Senate--Ben Wade,\r\nof Ohio.  Johnson removed, Wade would have been President, and the\r\nextreme radicals would have been in supreme control of the legislative\r\nand executive departments of the Government.\r\n\r\nThis condition is what made Mr. Blaine hesitate.  He told me on\r\none occasion:  \"Johnson in the White House is bad enough, but we\r\nknow what we have; Lord knows what we would get with old Ben Wade\r\nthere.  I do not know but I would rather trust Johnson than Wade.\"\r\nBut in the end Blaine supported the impeachment articles, just as\r\nI did, and as Senator Allison and other somewhat conservative\r\nmembers did, all feeling at the same time not a little doubtful of\r\nour course.\r\n\r\nStevens, Logan, Boutwell, Williams, and Wilson were appointed\r\nmanagers on the part of the House, and solemnly and officially\r\nnotified the Senate of the action of the House in impeaching the\r\nPresident of the United States.  The Senate proceeded without long\r\ndelay to resolve itself as a High Court of Impeachment, for the\r\npurpose of trying the President of the United States for high crimes\r\nand misdemeanors.  The most eminent counsel of the Nation were\r\nengaged.  Mr. Evarts was President Johnson's principal counsel.\r\nHe was ably assisted by lawyers of scarcely less renown.\r\n\r\nThe trial dragged along from day to day.  Part of the time the\r\nSenate considered the matter in executive session.  The corridors\r\nwere crowded; and I remember with what astonishment we heard that\r\nJudge Trumbull had taken the floor denouncing the proceeding as\r\nunworthy of a justice of the peace court.  The Illinois delegation\r\nheld a meeting, and Logan, Farnsworth, and Washburne urged that we\r\nunite in a letter to Judge Trumbull, with a view to influencing\r\nhis vote for conviction, or of inducing him to withhold his vote\r\nif he could not vote for conviction.  A number of our delegation\r\nopposed it, and the letter was not sent.\r\n\r\nI do not think that it would have made the slightest effect on\r\nJudge Trumbull had we sent it.  All sorts of coercing methods were\r\nused to influence wavering Senators.  Old Bob Schenck was the\r\nchairman of this movement, and he sent telegrams broadcast all over\r\nthe United States to the effect that there was great danger to the\r\npeace of the country and the Republican cause if impeachment failed,\r\nand asking the recipients to send their Senators public opinion by\r\nresolutions and delegations.  And responses came from all over the\r\nNorth, urging and demanding the impeachment of the President.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult now to realize the intense excitement of that\r\nperiod.  General Grant was there, tacitly acknowledged as the next\r\nnominee of the Republican party for the Presidency.  He took no\r\nactive part, but it was pretty well understood, from the position\r\nof his friends such as Logan and Washburne, that the impeachment\r\nhad his sympathy; and in the Senate Conkling was especially\r\nvindictive.  Grimes, Fessenden, and Trumbull led the fight for\r\nacquittal.  Many were noncommittal; but in the end the struggle\r\nturned on the one doubtful Senator, Edmund G. Ross of Kansas.\r\n\r\nIt was determined to vote on the tenth article first, as that\r\narticle was the strongest one and more votes could be mustered for\r\nit than any other.  It was well understood that the vote on that\r\narticle would settle the matter.\r\n\r\nMore than forty-three years have passed into history since that\r\nmemorable day when the Senate of the United States was sitting as\r\na Court of Impeachment for the purpose of trying the President of\r\nthe United States for high crimes and misdemeanors.  The occasion\r\nis unforgettable.  As I look back now, I see arising before me the\r\nforms and features of the great men who were sitting in that high\r\ncourt:  I see presiding Chief Justice Chase; I see Sumner, cold\r\nand dignified; Wade, Trumbull, Hendricks, Conkling, Yates; I see\r\nLogan as one of the managers on the part of the House; I see old\r\nThad Stevens, weak and wasted from illness, being carried in--all\r\nlong since have passed to the beyond, the accused President, the\r\nmembers of the high court, the counsel.  Of all the eminent men\r\nwho were present on that day, aside from the Hon. J. B. Henderson,\r\nI do not know of a single one now living.\r\n\r\nAs the roll was called, there was such a solemn hush as only comes\r\nwhen man stands in the presence of Deity.  Finally, when the name\r\nof Ross was reached and he voted \"No\"; when it was understood that\r\nhis vote meant acquittal, the friends of the President in the\r\ngalleries thundered forth in applause.\r\n\r\nAnd thus ended for the first, and I hope the last, time the trial\r\nof a President of the United States before the Senate, sitting as\r\na Court of Impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nSPEAKER OF THE LEGISLATURE, AND GOVERNOR\r\n1871 to 1883\r\n\r\nAfter my six years' service in the Lower House of Congress, I\r\nreturned home, not expecting ever again to take office, or engage\r\nin politics.  There was a contest going on in the State over the\r\nlocation of the State Capitol.  The State had committed itself to\r\nthe erection of a new Capitol building, and had really made\r\nconsiderable progress on its construction.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the question of changing the location from\r\nSpringfield to some other city was agitated.  Peoria made a very\r\nstrong effort for the removal to that city.  The work on the new\r\nbuilding, as an immediate result, was stopped.  The Legislature\r\nhad adjourned, and another election of members was to occur.  This\r\ncondition of local affairs existed when I returned home after my\r\nservice was finished in Washington.\r\n\r\nThe friends in my home county, in which the State Capitol is located,\r\nwaited on me and expressed a desire that I should allow my name to\r\nbe used as a candidate for the Legislature.  I made known my resolve\r\nnot to enter politics again; but they based the proposal upon a\r\nground that made it extremely difficult and embarrassing not to\r\naccede, to-wit:  they had been with me for anything I had ever\r\nwanted, and now they wanted me to reciprocate, and do as _they_\r\ndesired.  I did not feel that I could disregard their wishes, and\r\nso yielded to their demand; it was nothing less.\r\n\r\nThey then went to the Hon. Milton Hay, who was a great lawyer, and\r\nas good a man as I ever knew, and made the same demand upon him.\r\nHe was under no special obligation to yield to their wishes, for\r\nhe had never asked for office at the hands of the people.  He\r\ndeclined; but they also declined to take \"No\" for an answer.  The\r\nresult was that both Hay and I became candidates, were both elected,\r\nand the contest over the removal of the State Capitol was renewed.\r\n\r\nI was chosen Speaker.  Mr. Hay was the foremost lawyer of the\r\nLegislature.  One million dollars was reported from the proper\r\ncommittee of the House, and passed without opposition, and the work\r\non the Capitol was once more taken up.\r\n\r\nFinding myself again in politics, I determined to become a candidate\r\nfor Governor.  To be successful, it seemed to be important that I\r\nshould go back into the Legislature, which I did.  After my re-\r\nelection I was supported by the Republican party for Speaker for\r\nmy second term.\r\n\r\nHowever, the House of Representatives was in control of the\r\nopposition, composed of Democrats and Independents, the latter\r\nbeing more generally wrong than the Democrats, and much less\r\nreliable.  The combination organized the House, the Hon. Elijah\r\nHaines being elected Speaker, and the Republicans casting their\r\nunited vote for me.  This Legislature has ever since been known as\r\nthe \"Haines Legislature,\" the most notorious Legislature ever known\r\nin the State.  Haines was a man of ability--especially, to stir up\r\nstrife and produce confusion.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature convened in the Winter of 1875.  I was nominated\r\nfor Governor early in 1876, elected in November of the same year,\r\nand sworn in January, 1877.\r\n\r\nOn re-examining my inaugural address, I find much stated there that\r\nis at the present time, and must long remain, of historic interest\r\nto the people of Illinois; but since its length precludes reproduction\r\nhere, I can merely touch upon certain points, more fully covered\r\nin the address, that offer many curious aspects and contrasts in\r\nthe light of latter-day conditions.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the Legislature of that year was the first to meet\r\nin the new Capitol.  The effects of the financial panic of 1873\r\nwere still felt, but it was pointed out that the State's resources\r\nwere in no way impaired; that on the contrary--circumstances to be\r\nproud of--the volume of private indebtedness had been materially\r\nreduced, while the productive wealth of farms, buildings, factories,\r\nmines, and railroads had never before been so great.\r\n\r\nOf matters educational, there had been enrolled as pupils the\r\npreceding year (1876) 687,446 persons, and appropriations for public-\r\nschool purposes for the corresponding period had amounted to\r\n$8,268,539.58.\r\n\r\nAmong other matters of local interest adverted to, which to-day\r\nare as alive and momentous as they were then, were the subjects of\r\nnavigation--particularly on the Illinois River and the canal--and\r\nthe supervision of the railroads by the Railroad and Warehouse\r\nCommission.  At that time there were 7,285 miles of railroad in\r\nthe State--a greater mileage than any other State in the Union\r\ncould boast of.\r\n\r\nOnly eleven years had elapsed since the close of the Civil War,\r\nand its after-effects still worked like an obnoxious ferment in\r\nthe State's political conditions; closely allied with this was the\r\ninfluence of the Hayes-Tilden contest, all of which commanded a\r\nlarge proportion of my speech.\r\n\r\nOne extract I wish to quote in full, since it was prelude to events\r\nwhich followed so soon afterwards:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to add one suggestion in reference to the affairs of our\r\nown State, by calling your attention to the Militia Law.  I believe\r\na more perfect law should be enacted, which will secure a more\r\nthorough organization of the State militia.\r\n\r\n\"The spirit of our institutions and the temper of our people are\r\nhostile to a standing army, and I am opposed to any policy, State\r\nor National, looking to governing the people by bayonet; yet in\r\nthe most highly civilized communities a trained militia, recruited\r\nfrom the intelligent and industrious classes, is an almost\r\nindispensable auxiliary to the civil power in the interests of\r\npeace and good order.\"\r\n\r\nLittle did I dream that within six months of my inauguration the\r\ntimeliness and force of the suggestions, and any recommendations\r\ncontained in the closing paragraphs above, would find convincing\r\nillustrations in conditions throughout the Nation, and especially\r\nin Illinois.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1877, the famous strike of the railway employees came on.\r\nIt was exceptionally strong in the cities of Illinois--Chicago,\r\nDecatur, Springfield, Galesburg, East St. Louis, and every other\r\ncity of considerable size.  The State was ill prepared for such a\r\ncrisis.  The strike ran along for several days with the State\r\nunready to bring the matter to a close.  Having been in office but\r\na few months, I had not yet secured any arms or other military\r\nequipment with which to combat organized violations of the law.\r\nThe Illinois National Guard was inchoate--in fact, scarcely organized\r\nat all, except in companies voluntarily formed, which were almost\r\nentirely without military equipment.  Finally, however, I determined\r\nto order the National Guard to East St. Louis.\r\n\r\nI telegraphed to Chicago for a locomotive and car to take me to\r\nEast St. Louis about two o'clock on a specified night.  After\r\nordering the troops from different parts of the State to assemble\r\nat East St. Louis on a given day, I went to East St. Louis myself,\r\nthree or four gentlemen accompanying me.  There I found several\r\nthousand men sitting about on the curbs of the sidewalks, apparently\r\nperfectly quiet and inoffensive, if not unconcerned, and I concluded\r\nthat there was no reason why trains should not move.\r\n\r\nHowever, I first consulted with several railroad men, expressing\r\nthe opinion that the strikers and their sympathizers did not seem\r\ndesirous of disturbing anybody, and insisted that they proceed to\r\nmove out their trains.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of one of the roads finally promised to have a\r\ntrain made up, and undertake to move it.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said I.  \"Fire up, and I will come around about the\r\ntime you are ready to move.\"  He did as he had promised, and I went\r\naround with the friends who were accompanying me.\r\n\r\nBut about the time the train was ready to move, these mild-mannered\r\nlaboring men, to the number of five or six hundred, gently closed\r\nin upon the train, and put out the fire in the engine so it could\r\nnot be moved.\r\n\r\nThereupon, I stood upon the sidewalk and addressed this crowd of\r\nfive or six hundred fire-extinguishers.  I told them that I had\r\ncome there to move the trains, and while I did not want to hurt\r\nany one, that the trains would be started, if everybody who interfered\r\nfirst had to be disabled.  They gradually skulked away, and I\r\nordered the fire built up again, asserting that I would be back in\r\nhalf an hour to see the trains move.  But the men notified the\r\nengineer that they would kill any man who undertook to take the\r\ntrain out, and in the fact of that threat no one could be prevailed\r\nupon the man engines or train.\r\n\r\nFinally, however, one man agreed, if I would accompany him as far\r\nas Decatur, about a hundred miles, to endeavor to go out with the\r\ntrain.  I told him I could not do that, but I would stand by his\r\nside while he was going through the streets of East St. Louis.\r\nBut he would not agree to this, so that my efforts to move a single\r\ntrain had met with complete failure.  The result was that I was\r\ndriven to the expediency of calling upon the military arm of the\r\nState authority.\r\n\r\nThat evening the troops began to arrive.  They were stationed at\r\nthe strategic points of the city during the night, and the next\r\nmorning the trains moved out without a single accident or\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, the National Guard did not seem to accomplish anything.\r\nThe people there did not take them seriously, and the result was\r\nthat I called upon the National Government to send to that city a\r\nfew companies of regular troops.  I think they came from Omaha.\r\nWhen they arrived, and marched up the streets--that was the end of\r\nthe strike in that city.\r\n\r\nSo I managed to get through the trouble without injury to a single\r\nperson, or the loss of any property except that caused by the delay\r\nin the transaction of business.  These results were quite different\r\nfrom those in some other parts of the country.  My chief private\r\nsecretary was in the East somewhere, and could not return to me\r\nuntil the trouble was all over.\r\n\r\nAs Governor of a State in a time when actual war was not flagrant,\r\nI could only watch, as might any other American citizen, the exciting\r\nproceedings at the National Capital, and hope that our country\r\nmight issue from the political contest without a weakening of our\r\ninstitutions or loss of prestige.  At the same time, I felt that\r\nI might appropriately express my approval of the attitude of the\r\nNational administration, which I did in a letter to the President.\r\n\r\nWhen I was Governor of the State of Illinois, I had the good fortune\r\nof becoming intimately acquainted with one of the great soldiers\r\nof the recent Civil War, who was, in my judgment, the greatest\r\ncavalry leader of modern times,--General Phil Sheridan.  He was\r\nCommander of the Department of the Lakes during my administration,\r\nand I had the pleasure of meeting him on numerous occasions.\r\n\r\nAt an immense reunion of volunteer soldiers from Northern Illinois,\r\nMichigan, and Wisconsin, which was held in Aurora, I, as Governor\r\nof the State, was invited to make the first address.  General\r\nSheridan was invited to be present and take part in this celebration,\r\nand he came down from Chicago, accompanied by his wife.  I met them\r\nat Aurora.  We rode in the same carriage, at the rear of the\r\nprocession, to the fair grounds, a mile or so distant from the\r\ncity.  The day was hot, and as we entered a dense grove, on the\r\nroad, the soldiers halted for a breathing spell, and while at rest\r\nmany of them went to a well near by for water.  It was observed by\r\nsome of the soldiers that General Sheridan remained in the carriage,\r\nand they immediately surrounded us.  He greeted all cordially and\r\ngood-naturedly, being very fond of soldiers who had fought on the\r\nUnion side of the great struggle between the North and the South.\r\nWhat immediately followed pleased Mrs. Sheridan and those who were\r\nnear, and amused Sheridan himself.  A big Irish soldier-boy got\r\nhold of Sheridan's hand and pulled him out of the carriage.  Being\r\nof small stature, General Sheridan was at the mercy of the stalwart\r\nIrishman, who dealt with him in a very rough way, slapping him on\r\nthe back with great force, and with as much earnestness exclaiming:\r\n\"Boys, this is the damnedest, bravest little Mick in America!\"\r\n\r\nAs is well known now, the operations of General Sheridan in the\r\nShenandoah Valley and the region of Richmond called forth the\r\nplaudits of the Nation and the commendation of his superiors.  His\r\nvictories had much to do with bringing the Civil War to a close.\r\nHe was conscious of the power and value of the cavalry arm of the\r\narmy.  In discussing his great achievements he made the remarkable\r\nstatement that with a force of five or ten thousand cavalrymen,\r\nwill organized, he could run over an army of almost any size.\r\nWhether this be true or not, it remains that General Grant had\r\nimplicit confidence in Sheridan's ability to command the cavalry\r\nforces in a manner superior to any other officer in the Union Army.\r\n\r\nIt was on the suggestion of Grant that Sheridan was brought from\r\nthe West to take command of the cavalry.  After coming East, he\r\nwas presented to President Lincoln.  The President scrutinized him\r\nclosely.  He did not appear to be the officer recommended to him\r\nby Grant as the one man who could bring the cavalry forces to that\r\nstandard which was so much desired.\r\n\r\nThe first time Lincoln met Grant after Sheridan called on him he\r\nexpressed his doubt.  \"The officer you brought from the West seems\r\nrather a little fellow to handle your cavalry,\" said he.\r\n\r\nGrant, however, unshaken in the belief that he at last had an\r\nofficer under him whom he could trust in charge of all the armies\r\nof the Union if necessary, replied:  \"You will find him big enough\r\nfor the purpose before we get through with him.\"\r\n\r\nSheridan was not only popular with his superior officers and men\r\nunder him, but with the people generally.  He was held in the\r\nhighest esteem by the people of my State.  After his promotion to\r\nthe rank of Lieutenant-General, the citizens of Chicago presented\r\nhim with a house in Washington, as a mark of their friendship and\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nWhile Governor I rendered a decision in an extradition case, which\r\nformed a precedent, and which is referred to by writers on\r\nextradition.\r\n\r\nMoore comments on it as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In December, 1878, an interesting decision was made by Governor\r\nCullom, of Illinois, in the case of two persons named Gaffigan and\r\nMerrick, whose surrender was demanded by the Governor of Pennsylvania\r\non a charge of murder committed in that State in January, 1865.\r\nAccompanying the requisition was an indictment found against them\r\nin Pennsylvania in March, 1865, for the crime for which their\r\nrendition was demanded.  It was alleged in their behalf that soon\r\nafter the murder was committed, and before the indictment was found,\r\nthey left their place of residence in Pennsylvania and went to\r\nIllinois, where they had resided continuously in an open manner,\r\nbearing their own names, transacting daily business, and holding\r\nresponsible public positions.  In 1870 or 1871 Gaffigan was joined\r\nby his father, who left their former place of residence in Pennsylvania\r\nwith the avowed purpose of joining his son in Illinois.  The\r\nresidence of the latter in Illinois was also known to other persons\r\nin the particular locality in Pennsylvania, among whom were a\r\nconstable and a witness whose name was endorsed on the indictment.\r\nOn the other hand, the prosecuting attorney in Pennsylvania denied\r\nthat there had been any laches in the matter, and declared that he\r\nhad acted upon the first knowledge that he had acquired in respect\r\nto the whereabouts of the persons charged.  Governor Cullom held\r\nthat while it might be inferred from the fact that the accused left\r\nthe State of Pennsylvania shortly after the date of the murder that\r\nthey were fugitives from justice, yet this character did not always\r\nadhere to them; and that their long residence in Illinois, which\r\nwas so entirely unconcealed and well known, that the officers of\r\njustice in Pennsylvania could have been ignorant of it only because\r\nthey made no effort to find it out, had purged them of the character\r\nof fugitives from justice.  It may be argued that this decision\r\nrests on moral rather than on strictly legal grounds.  It is\r\ngenerally held that there is no limitation as to the time in recovery\r\nof fugitives from justice other than such as may be established by\r\nstatutes of limitations of the Governments concerned, and it does\r\nnot appear to have been suggested in the case under consideration\r\nthat any such limitation had been established either by the laws\r\nof Pennsylvania or of Illinois.  The decision of Governor Cullom\r\nmay also be thought to involve the theory that the authorities of\r\nthe demanding State may be called upon to show that they have used\r\ndue diligence in pursuing the fugitives and in seeking their\r\nsurrender.\"\r\n\r\nThe decision created much comment at the time, some adverse,\r\nsuggesting that it amounted to the exercise of the pardoning power\r\nby a Governor of one state for a crime committed in another.\r\n\r\nMy administration as Governor of Illinois was a very quiet, uneventful\r\none.  I endeavored to give the State strictly a business administration,\r\nand I believe I succeeded.  I appointed the very best men that I\r\ncould find to State offices.  I did not interfere with the conduct\r\nof the various departments and institutions, except to exercise a\r\ngeneral supervision over them.  I held my appointees strictly\r\naccountable for the conduct of the affairs of their respective\r\noffices, and did not attempt to dictate to them the appointment of\r\ntheir subordinates.\r\n\r\nDuring the six years I served as Governor there was not a single\r\nscandal connected with the executive department of Illinois.  I\r\nnever had the slightest trouble with the Legislature.  I never\r\ninterfered in the organization of the Senate or House.  I believed\r\nthen, and I believe now, in the independence of the three co-ordinate\r\nbranches of the Government.  I no more thought of influencing the\r\nLegislature than I would have thought of attempting to influence\r\nthe Judiciary.  My recommendations were made in official messages,\r\nas the Constitution prescribes, and generally, I might say, the\r\nLegislature carried out my recommendations.  The administration\r\nwas an economical one, and it was during this period that the entire\r\nState debt was paid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nGRANT\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance with General Grant began when he visited Springfield\r\nthe first time immediately after the beginning of the Civil War.\r\nHe came to Springfield with a company of soldiers raised at Galena.\r\nGeneral John A. Rawlins, afterwards Secretary of War under President\r\nGrant, one of the best men whom I ever knew, and especially my\r\nfriend, was with this company.  General Grant offered his services\r\nto Governor Yates in any capacity, and the Governor requested him\r\nto aid General Mather, then our Adjutant-General.  General Grant,\r\nhaving been a West Point graduate, and having served as a captain\r\nin the regular army, rendered the Adjutant-General very material\r\nservice.  On the morning I saw him in the Adjutant-General's office\r\nat Springfield, nobody ever dreamed that this quiet, unassuming\r\nsubordinate would, in less than four years, become one of the\r\ngreatest generals in all the world's history.  At the outbreak of\r\nthe war he resided at Galena, where he was in business.\r\n\r\nHe was sent by Governor Yates to muster in the various regiments,\r\nand continued in that work until made Colonel of the Twenty-fist\r\nIllinois Regiment.  This regiment had been raised and organized by\r\nanother man, whose habits were not regular, and under whose command\r\nthe regiment had become demoralized.  General Grant took the Twenty-\r\nfirst Illinois on foot from Springfield into Missouri, and before\r\nhe had travelled very far with it, the men quickly learned that he\r\nwas a real commanding officer, a strict disciplinarian, and that\r\norders were issued to be obeyed.  The regiment became one of the\r\nbest in the service.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was soon made a Brigadier-General, the first to be\r\ncommissioned from Illinois, and was sent to command at Cairo.\r\n\r\nI became pretty well acquainted with him at Springfield, and\r\nsubsequently I visited Cairo, and found there General Grant, Governor\r\nOglesby, and other Illinoisans in command of regiments.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's career as a soldier is too well known to the world\r\nto be repeated by me here.  The history of his career is the history\r\nof the Civil War.  He was formally received by the people of\r\nSpringfield on two occasions:  once while he was still in command\r\nin the army; and again in 1880, after his trip around the world,\r\nhe was my guest at the Executive Mansion in Springfield.  He was\r\nthen accompanied by Mrs. Grant, and by E. B. Washburne, who had\r\nbeen one of his closest personal friends during his administration.\r\n\r\nThe time was approaching for the National Convention at Chicago,\r\nand General Grant's friends had prevailed upon him to permit the\r\nuse of his name as a candidate for a third term.  Washburne had\r\nbecome considerably flattered by the demonstration that was made\r\nover him on the road from Galena to Springfield, and I believe he\r\nhad an idea that he might be the nominee instead of General Grant,\r\nand hence for some reason or other he did not want to identify\r\nhimself with General Grant at all.  When the time came to go to\r\nthe reception at the State House, Washburne could not be found.\r\nIt seemed that he had hid in his bedroom until the party left the\r\nExecutive Mansion for the State House, and then went by himself to\r\nthe State House, and secreted himself in the office of the Secretary\r\nof State, where he surreptitiously watched proceedings from behind\r\nthe sheltering folds of a curtain.\r\n\r\nHis conduct in the evening was still more remarkable.  I had arranged\r\na reception to General and Mrs. Grant and Mr. Washburne at the\r\nExecutive Mansion that same evening, but Mr. Washburne gave some\r\nexcuse which he claimed necessitated his presence in the East, and\r\ndeparted--apparently with the conviction that he might secure the\r\nPresidential nomination himself, and feeling that his presence in\r\ncompany with General Grant--an avowed candidate--created an\r\nembarrassing situation that he could not endure.  I know that\r\nGeneral Grant was deeply grieved at his conduct.  The General's\r\nfriends were so outraged that they determined Washburne should have\r\nno place upon the ticket at all.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was not a candidate for re-election at the end of\r\nhis second term; I am not at all sure whether he would not have\r\nbeen glad to be re-elected for a third term--at least, he would\r\nhave accepted the nomination had it been tendered to him.  But the\r\nthird-term proposition, at that time, received a severe blow when,\r\nin December, 1875, the House of Representatives passed a resolution\r\nby a vote of 234 to 18, declaring that in its opinion, the precedent\r\nestablished by Washington and other Presidents of the United States,\r\nin retiring from the Presidential office after their second terms,\r\nhad become, by universal concurrence, a part of our republican\r\nsystem of government, and that any departure from this time-honored\r\ncustom would be unwise, unpatriotic, and fraught with peril to our\r\nfree institutions.\r\n\r\nThe passage of this resolution, the scandals in the administration,\r\nthe hard times, and the bitter and determined opposition to General\r\nGrant at this time, put an end temporarily to all third-term talk.\r\n\r\nBut during his absence, when he was making his tour of the world,\r\nafter he had retired from the Presidency, Senator Conkling, General\r\nLogan, Don Cameron, and other leading politicians concluded that\r\nthey would nominate him to succeed Rutherford B. Hayes, who was\r\nnot a candidate.  After his return to the United States, they\r\nsecured his consent to use his name as a candidate for the nomination\r\nin 1880; but after a bitter fight in the Chicago Convention they\r\nfailed, and General Garfield obtained the nomination.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine, before the Convention met, was the leading candidate\r\nagainst General Grant.  I had been a warm friend of Mr. Blaine's\r\nin Congress; but as General Grant was a candidate from my own State,\r\nand as I was at that time Governor of Illinois and a candidate for\r\nrenomination, I did not feel that I could take any part in the\r\ncontest between Grant and Blaine.\r\n\r\nWhen the State Convention met to select a candidate to succeed me\r\nas Governor, the contest between Grant and Blaine was very bitter.\r\nMr. Blaine and I had been very friendly in the House; indeed, I\r\nwas one of the few personal friends who brought him out as a\r\ncandidate for Speaker of the House.  From our past relations, he\r\nfelt perfectly free to write me, and about the time of the Convention,\r\nI received a letter from him, in which he said, among other things,\r\n\"Why cannot you put yourself at the head of my forces, and lead\r\nthem?  If you are not careful you will fall between.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone of the letter annoyed me, and I did not answer it until\r\nthe contest was over, which resulted in my own nomination, and\r\nuntil after the National Convention met, in which Blaine was\r\ndefeated.  I then wrote him a letter, informing him that I had been\r\nnominated; but, of course, I did not refer to his defeat.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of the convention in Springfield, about the time\r\nit was to convene, General Logan came down from Chicago, proceeding\r\nat once to my house.  He told me that he desired I should help him\r\nto secure the delegation for General Grant.\r\n\r\nI replied:  \"General Logan, if you are my friend, and I suppose\r\nyou are, you will not ask me to take any part in this contest, as\r\nI am a candidate for renomination myself.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a little huffy about it, and seemed to be disappointed that\r\nI would not do as he asked.  And I may remark that this was\r\ncharacteristic of Logan.  He went away considerably out of humor,\r\nbut saying nothing especially to the point.\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards the Hon. Charles B. Farwell, who was later\r\nan honored colleague of mine in the Senate, drove up to my house\r\nand said:  \"Cullom, I want you to help me carry this State for\r\nBlaine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charley,\" I replied, \"you know very well that I am a candidate\r\nfor re-election; and you know very well, also, that if I were to\r\ntake a hand in this contest, I would probably be beaten.\"  He agreed\r\nwith me, and went away satisfied, assuring me that in his opinion\r\nI was doing the right thing.\r\n\r\nThe contest in our State Convention between Blaine and Grant lasted\r\nfor at least three days, and resulted in the division of the\r\ndelegation to the National Convention, part for Grant and part for\r\nBlaine.  I had quite a contest for the nomination, but was finally\r\nnamed on the fourth ballot.  I had expected to be nominated on the\r\nthird ballot.  Farwell was about my office a good deal during the\r\nconvention.  When the third ballot was taken, and I had not been\r\nnominated, I said:  \"Farwell, there is something wrong upstairs;\r\nI wish you would go up and straighten it out.\"\r\n\r\nHe went; but what he did, if anything, I do not know.  However, I\r\nwas nominated on the next ballot.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was nominated both the first and second times without\r\nopposition.  He was first nominated in Chicago, with great enthusiasm.\r\nThe second time he was nominated in Philadelphia.  I was chairman\r\nof the Illinois delegation at Philadelphia, and as such placed him\r\nin nomination.\r\n\r\nI believe I made about the shortest nominating speech for a Republican\r\ncandidate for President ever made in a National Republican Convention.\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the Convention:  On behalf of the great Republican\r\nparty of Illinois, and that of the Union--in the name of liberty,\r\nof loyalty, of justice, and of law--in the interest of economy, of\r\ngood government, of peace, and of the equal rights of all--remembering\r\nwith profound gratitude his glorious achievements in the field,\r\nand his noble statesmanship as Chief Magistrate of this great Nation\r\n--I nominate as President of the United States, for a second term,\r\nUlysses S. Grant.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable contest over the platform, and as usual,\r\nit was determined to adopt the platform before making the nominations\r\nof President and Vice-President.  But the Convention became very\r\nrestless after the day of speechmaking; evening was approaching,\r\nand the Committee on Platform being still out, it was determined\r\nto make the nomination for President that day.  I mounted the\r\nplatform, and in the brief speech I have quoted, placed General\r\nGrant in nomination.  I never saw such a fervid audience.  The\r\nfloors and galleries were crowded, and the people seemed wild with\r\nenthusiasm for Grant.  As I uttered the word \"Grant,\" at the\r\nconclusion of my speech, and his picture was lowered from the\r\nceiling of the hall, the demonstration was indescribable.\r\n\r\nWhile we were waiting for the Committee on Platform to report,\r\nthere were quite a number of speeches by favorite sons of the\r\ndifferent States, Senator Logan and Governor Oglesby, from Illinois,\r\nbeing among them.\r\n\r\nSenator Logan's speech is not very clear in my memory; but I do\r\nremember very well the speech by Governor Oglesby.  He made a\r\nwonderful impression.  I do not recall that I ever saw a man\r\nelectrify an audience as did Governor Oglesby on that occasion.\r\nIt was the first convention where there were colored men admitted\r\nas delegates.  Some of the colored delegates occupied the main\r\nfloor.  Old Garret Smith, the great abolitionist, was in the gallery,\r\nat the head of the New York delegation.  Oglesby took for his theme\r\nfirst the colored man, represented there on the floor of that\r\nconvention, and then Garret Smith.  He set the crowd wild.  They\r\ncheered him to the echo.  We adjourned for luncheon immediately\r\nafter he concluded his speech, and many of the delegates asked me\r\nwho that man was.  I was proud to be able to tell them that it was\r\nGovernor Oglesby of Illinois; and the remark was frequently made\r\nthat it was no wonder that Illinois gave sixty thousand Republican\r\nmajority with such a man as its Governor.\r\n\r\nThe platform was finally adopted, and Wilson of Massachusetts was\r\nnominated for Vice-President, in place of Schulyer Colfax.  Colfax\r\nwas much mortified at his defeat, but it turned out for the best,\r\nbecause Colfax became involved in the _Crédit Mobilier_ before the\r\ncampaign was over, and his name on the ticket would have injured\r\nthe chances for success.  Wilson, who was nominated to succeed\r\nColfax for Vice-President, was a very good man.  He was a Senator,\r\nand it was said of him that he came from the shoemaker's bench to\r\nthe Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant got along very well during his first term as President.\r\nHe was wonderfully popular, and no one could have beaten him; but\r\nduring his second term, so many scandals came to light, and the\r\nfinances were in such bad shape, that generally his second term as\r\nPresident cannot be said to have been a success.  One trouble with\r\nhim as President was that he placed too much implicit reliance on\r\nthose about him, and he never could be convinced that any friend\r\nof his could do a wrong.  Some of his friends were clearly guilty\r\nof the grossest kind of misconduct, and yet he would not be convinced\r\nof it, and stuck to them until they nearly dragged him down into\r\ndisgrace with them.  He was not a politician.  Before entering the\r\nWhite House he had had no previous experience in public office.\r\nFor a considerable time he attempted to act as Chief Executive with\r\nthe same arbitrary power that he used as commander of an army;\r\nhence he was constantly getting into trouble with Senators and\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nI remember one little experience along this line which I had with\r\nhim.  It is an unwritten rule that Representatives in Congress, if\r\nin harmony with the Administration, control the post-office\r\nappointments in their respective districts.  On my recommendation\r\nIsaac Keyes was appointed postmaster of my own city of Springfield.\r\nMuch to my astonishment and mortification, in a month, without any\r\nwarning, without any request for Keyes' resignation, General Grant\r\nsent in the appointment of Elder Crane.  When I came to inquire\r\nthe cause, he said he had just happened to remember that he had\r\npromised the office to Elder Crane, and he immediately sent in the\r\nappointment without considering for a minute the position in which\r\nhe left Keyes and the embarrassment it would cause me.\r\n\r\nSometime afterward, as Colonel Bluford Wilson tells me, General\r\nGrant asked Colonel Wilson, then Solicitor of the Treasury, who\r\nwould make a good Commissioner of Internal Revenue.  Colonel Wilson\r\nreplied that Cullom was just the man for the place, and General\r\nGrant said at once, \"I will appoint him.\"  When Colonel Wilson went\r\nto the White House with the commission prepared for my appointment,\r\nGeneral Grant said:  \"I have changed my mind about making that\r\nappointment.  I offended Cullom in reference to the appointment of\r\na postmaster of his town; and if I should appoint him Commissioner\r\nof Internal Revenue now, I know he would decline it, so I will not\r\nappoint him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in this he was quite right.  I would have declined the office,\r\nnot because I was offended at him, but because I would not accept\r\nthat or any other appointive office.\r\n\r\nNot being quite certain that my memory served me correctly in\r\nreference to this incident, I took occasion to ask Colonel Bluford\r\nWilson, who had called on me at Washington, to give me the facts,\r\nwhich he later did in a long letter that sets forth the facts\r\nsomewhat more elaborately than I have given them, but presenting\r\nthe incident in an identical light.\r\n\r\nWhile I would not say that General Grant was a failure as President,\r\ncertain it is that he added nothing to his great fame as a soldier.\r\nIndeed, in the opinion of very many people, who were his friends\r\nand well-wishers, when he retired from the White House he had\r\ndetracted rather than added to his name.  It would probably have\r\nbeen better if General Grant had been content with his military\r\nsuccess, and had entered neither politics nor business.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was one of the greatest soldiers of modern times;\r\nindeed, if not of all time.  Standing as he does the peer of\r\nFrederick, Napoleon, Wellington, the time will come when the very\r\nfact that he was President of the United States will be forgotten,\r\nwhile he will be remembered only as one of the world's great\r\ncaptains.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw the General was about a month before he died.\r\nI was in New York, with the select Committee on Interstate Commerce,\r\nand on Sunday morning we learned that General Grant, General Arthur,\r\nand ex-President Hayes were all in town, and that Grant and Arthur\r\nwere ill.  We determined to call on each of them.\r\n\r\nWe first called on General Grant at his home, and found that his\r\nson, General Frederick D. Grant, was with him.  To him we sent our\r\ncards and asked to see his father.  He said he would ascertain,\r\nand he came back directly and said that his father would be glad\r\nto see us, but cautioned us not to permit him to talk too much, as\r\nthe trouble was in his throat.  We went in and took seats for a\r\nmoment.  He greeted us all very cordially, and seemed to be specially\r\ninterested in meeting Secretary Gorman.  He wanted to talk, and\r\ndid talk so rapidly and so incessantly that, fearing it was injuring\r\nhim, we arose from our seats and told him that we had called simply\r\nto pay our respects, and expressed our gratification that he was\r\nso well.\r\n\r\nI can see him yet, as I saw him then.  He was sitting up, surrounded\r\nby the manuscript of his memoirs.  He knew that his end was\r\napproaching, and he talked about it quietly and unconcernedly; said\r\nhe was about through with his book, that if he could live a month\r\nor two longer he could improve it, but did not seem to feel very\r\nmuch concern whether he had any more time or not.  Mrs. Grant and\r\nNellie, and Mrs. Frederick D. Grant were in an adjoining room, with\r\nthe door open, and knowing them all very well, I went in to pay my\r\nrespects.  Mrs. Grant at once inquired about my daughters.  I told\r\nher that one of them was married, and she expressed surprise.\r\nGeneral Grant, hearing us, came into the room and said, \"Julia,\r\ndon't you remember that we received cards to the wedding?\"  He\r\nagain began to talk, so I took my leave.\r\n\r\nFrom there we called on General Arthur, and then on General Hayes.\r\nBoth passed away within a short time.\r\n\r\nI returned to my home in Springfield, and in about a month the news\r\ncame that General Grant was dead.  On the day of his funeral in\r\nNew York, in cities of any importance in the country, services were\r\nheld.  Services were conducted in Springfield, on which occasion\r\nI delivered the principal address.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nGENERAL JOHN A. LOGAN\r\n\r\nGeneral John A. Logan was a man much more capable of accomplishing\r\nresults than either General Palmer or General Oglesby.\r\n\r\nI first met him when he was a member of the Legislature, in 1856.\r\nHe was a Democrat then, and a very active and aggressive one.  It\r\nwas in that year that we first elected a Republican Administration\r\nin Illinois, the Republican party having been organized only two\r\nyears previously.  Bissell was elected Governor; Hatch, Secretary\r\nof State; and Dubois, Auditor.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bissell was ill, having suffered a stroke of paralysis,\r\nand it became necessary for the Legislature, after organizing, to\r\ngo to the Executive Mansion to witness the administration of the\r\noath of office to him.  After the Legislature reconvened in their\r\nrespective Houses, General Logan immediately obtained recognition\r\nand made a bitter attack on Governor Bissell on the ground that\r\nthe latter had sworn to a falsehood, he having challenged, or been\r\nchallenged by Jefferson Davis to fight a duel.  The duel was never\r\nactually fought; but Governor Bissell took the ground that whatever\r\ndid occur was outside the jurisdiction of the State of Illinois,\r\nand he therefore could truthfully take the oath of office.  Logan\r\nwas then about as strong a Democrat as he afterwards was a Republican.\r\nHis attack on Bissell was resented by Republicans and under the\r\ncircumstances was regarded as cruel.  I became very much prejudiced\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nAfter this episode Logan was elected to Congress as a Democrat,\r\nand was a follower of Douglas.  Douglas was true to the Union, and\r\nafter he made his famous speech before the Legislature at Springfield,\r\nGeneral Logan entered the war and finally became a Republican.\r\n\r\nIt was alleged that there was an understanding between Douglas and\r\nthe Democratic delegation in Congress from Illinois that they should\r\nall act together in whatever course they pursued.  The delegation\r\nfrom Illinois contained some very able men, among them being General\r\nLogan.  Douglas came out for the Union without consulting his\r\ncolleagues in the delegation, and it was said that General Logan\r\nand the other Democratic members of the delegation were quite angry.\r\nHowever, they all followed Douglas and became loyal Union men.\r\n\r\nLike Governor Oglesby, General Logan had a brief military service\r\nin the Mexican War, and also like Governor Oglesby, and General\r\nMcClernand, he was among the first to raise a regiment for service\r\nin the Civil War.  He resigned his seat in Congress in 1861, and\r\nimmediately went into active service.  Senator Douglas and General\r\nLogan did much to save Southern Illinois to the Union, and that\r\nportion of the State contributed its full quota to the Union Army.\r\n\r\nTo describe the part General Logan took in the Civil War, after he\r\nraised the Thirty-first Illinois Regiment and took the field, would\r\nbe to recite the history of the war itself.  The records of his\r\nbravery at Belmont; of his gallant charge at Fort Donelson, where,\r\nas a Colonel, he was dangerously wounded; of his service as Major-\r\nGeneral commanding the Army of the Tennessee; of the memorable\r\nsiege of Vicksburg, when with the great leader of the Union armies\r\nhe stood knocking at the door of that invincible stronghold; of\r\nhis service with Sherman on his famous march to the sea, all are\r\nwritten on the pages of history and lend undying lustre to the name\r\nof Logan.\r\n\r\nHe was a natural soldier.  His shoulders were broad, his presence\r\nwas commanding; with his swarthy face and coal black hair, \"and\r\neye like Mars, to threaten and command,\" he was every inch a warrior.\r\nThere is no question that General Logan was the greatest volunteer\r\nofficer of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nAfter the war Logan returned to Illinois, intending to re-enter\r\nthe practice of the law; but he loved public life and politics,\r\nwas the idol of the people of his section of the State, and was\r\nsoon elected Congressman-at-large on the Republican ticket.  When\r\nI entered the House in 1865, I found General Logan there, ranking\r\nas one of the leaders of the more radical Republicans.  He was a\r\nforceful speaker, and did his full share as one of the mangers on\r\nthe part of the House in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson.\r\n\r\nHe was devoted to General Grant and General Grant was very fond of\r\nhim.  General Grant, in talking of General Logan and Senator Morton\r\nof Indiana, used to say that they were the two most persistent men\r\nin the Senate in securing offices for their friends; but there was\r\nthis difference between them:  if Morton came to him and wanted\r\nten offices and he gave him one, he would go away feeling perfectly\r\nsatisfied, and make the impression on the people that he was running\r\nthe Administration; while if Logan came to the White House to secure\r\nten offices, and did not get more than nine of them, he would raise\r\na great row, and claim that he could not get anything out of the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nBut Logan stood strongly for General Grant, no only during his two\r\nterms, where he had little or no opposition, but he was one of the\r\nleaders in the unsuccessful attempt to nominate him for a third\r\nterm.  Logan, Conkling, Cameron and others failed, and I believe\r\nthat General Logan felt the failure more than even General Grant\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nGeneral Logan was a tremendously industrious man.  He was always\r\ndoing favors for his people, and seemed to delight in being of\r\nservice to any one.  That was the difference between him and Governor\r\nOglesby.  Logan was always willing and anxious to do favors for\r\npeople, while Oglesby was not.\r\n\r\nI remember an incident that illustrates this very well.  Jacob\r\nBunn, of Springfield, as honest a man as ever lived and a man of\r\nhigh standing, was compelled to take a distillery in part payment\r\nof a very large debt which was owing to him, and to make it of any\r\naccount he had to operate it until such a time as he could dispose\r\nof it.  He had some explanation he desired to make to the Commissioner\r\nof Internal Revenue, and he came to Washington and asked Governor\r\nOglesby, who was then in the Senate, to introduce him to the\r\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue.  Oglesby knew Bunn very well,\r\nand yet he cross-examined him at great length and detail.  Bunn\r\nleft Oglesby and next morning sought Logan, who at once agreed to\r\nperform the favor, with the result that Mr. Bunn very readily\r\nadjusted the matter with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\r\nBunn afterwards said to me:  \"I had a good deal more trouble\r\nconvincing Governor Oglesby that I was an honest man than I had\r\nconvincing the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\"\r\n\r\nI give this incident as illustrating the difference between the\r\ncharacters of Oglesby and Logan.\r\n\r\nThe latter's honesty and integrity were never doubted.  I believe\r\nhe would not have hesitated for a moment to kill any one who would\r\nhave questioned his honesty.  He was a poor man, and when I came\r\nto the Senate as his colleague we often sat together condoling with\r\neach other on our poverty, and \"abusing\" the men in the Senate who\r\nwere wealthy.  This was one of the common bonds between us.  When\r\nI became well acquainted with General Logan, I believed in him and\r\nadmired him as one of the ablest men of Illinois.  He was a man of\r\nintense feeling, intense friendships, and I might also add that he\r\nwas a man of the most intense hatreds.\r\n\r\nGeneral Logan, while never doubting his friends, yet expected his\r\nfriends to swear devotion to him every time they saw him.  He was\r\n\"touchy\" in this respect, and would not readily overlook any fancied\r\nslights.  On one occasion, my old friend, the Hon. David T. Littler,\r\nnow deceased, of Springfield, Illinois, who was also a warm friend\r\nof Logan, went to Washington, and neglected to call on Logan until\r\nhe had been there several days.  Logan knew that he was in town,\r\nand when he finally did call, Logan abused him roundly for not\r\ncoming to see him the first thing.  It made Littler angry for the\r\ntime being, and he showed his resentment as only Littler could.\r\nHe made Logan apologize and agree never to find fault with him\r\nagain.  They were on good terms as long as they lived.\r\n\r\nGeneral Logan was my friend, and was always for me when I was\r\nrunning for office.  It was sometimes tolerably hard to him to be\r\nfor me as against a soldier, because there was never a man who was\r\nmore thoroughly devoted to the soldiers.  As colleagues in the\r\nSenate, we got along very agreeably and never had any cross-purposes\r\nor differences of opinion.\r\n\r\nThe only time I remember of ever having any feeling at all was on\r\none occasion when Senator Logan, Senator Evarts, and Senator Teller\r\nwere strongly advocating the seating of Henry B. Payne, of Ohio,\r\nas a matter of right and without investigation.  I was disposed to\r\nvote for the taking of evidence and an investigation.  When the\r\ndiscussion was going on, I stated to Logan that I felt like voting\r\nin favor of the investigation.  He was very much out of humor about\r\nit.  I consulted with some friends in the Senate as to what I ought\r\nto do under the circumstances, and they advised me, in view of\r\nGeneral Logan's personal feeling on the subject--and he felt that\r\nhe was personally involved--that I ought to vote with him.\r\n\r\nAfter the vote was announced, I went around to General Logan's\r\nseat, and he expressed intense gratification that I had voted with\r\nhim, remarking that if I had been involved in a struggle as he was,\r\nhe would take the roof off the house before he would let me be\r\nbeaten; and I believe he would have gone to almost any extent.\r\n\r\nI then said to him:  \"General Logan, I want to assure you that\r\nhereafter you must not feel concerned about my vote being the same\r\nas yours.  In other words, when I want to vote one way and you want\r\nto vote another, I shall be perfectly satisfied, and shall have no\r\nfeeling against you on account of it; I want you to feel the same\r\nway when conditions are reversed.\"  He acquiesced in this proposal;\r\nbut we never afterwards had occasion to differ on any important\r\nquestion before the Senate.\r\n\r\nGeneral Logan had an ambition to become President, and I believe\r\nhe would have realized his ambition had he lived.\r\n\r\nI placed him in nomination for President at the National Convention\r\nwhich met at Chicago in 1884.  In _The Washington National Tribune_\r\nappears the following report:\r\n\r\n\"The next State that responded was Illinois, and as Senator Cullom\r\nmounted the platform to present the name of General John A. Logan,\r\ncheer after cheer followed him.  When he was at last allowed to\r\nproceed, he began by referring to the nominations of Lincoln and\r\nGrant, both from Illinois, and both nominated at Chicago:\r\n\r\n'In 1880, the party, assembled again at Chicago, achieved success\r\nby nominating Garfield; and now in 1884, in the same State, Illinois,\r\nwhich has never wavered in its adherence to the Republican party,\r\npresents, as the standard-bearer of that party, another son, one\r\nwhose name would be recognized from one end of the land to the\r\nother as an able statesman, a brilliant soldier, and an honest man\r\n--John A. Logan.'\r\n\r\n\"The announcement of General Logan's name was received with a wild\r\nburst of applause, a great many persons rising to their feet, waving\r\ntheir hats and handkerchiefs, and the thousands of people in the\r\ngallery joining in the roars of applause.  The cheers were renewed\r\nagain and again.  The speaker resumed:\r\n\r\n'A native of the State which he represents in the Council of the\r\nNation, reared among the youth of a section where every element of\r\nmanhood is early brought into play, he is eminently a man of the\r\npeople.  The safety, the permanency, and the prosperity of the\r\nNation depend upon the courage, the integrity, and the loyalty of\r\nits citizens. . . . Like Douglas, he believed that in time of war\r\nmen must be either patriots or traitors, and he threw his mighty\r\ninfluence on the side of the Union; and Illinois made a record\r\nsecond to none in the history of States in the struggle to preserve\r\nthe Union. . . .\r\n\r\n'During the long struggle of four years he commanded, under the\r\nauthority of the Government, first a regiment, then a brigade, then\r\na division, then an army corps, and finally an army.  He remained\r\nin the service until the war closed, when at the head of his army,\r\nwith the scars of battle upon him, he marched into the capital of\r\nthe Nation, and with the brave men whom he had led on a hundred\r\nhard-fought fields was mustered out of the service under the very\r\nshadow of the Capitol building which he had left four years before\r\nas a member of Congress to go and fight the battles of his country.\r\n\r\n'When the war was over and peace victoriously restored, he was\r\nagain invited by his fellow-citizens to take his place in the\r\nCouncils of the Nation.  In a service of twenty years in both Houses\r\nof Congress he has shown himself to be no less able and distinguished\r\nas a citizen than he was renowned as a soldier.  Conservative in\r\nthe advocacy of measures involving the public welfare, ready and\r\neloquent in debate, fearless--yes, I repeat again, fearless--in\r\ndefence of the rights of the weak against the oppression of the\r\nstrong, he stands to-day closer to the great mass of the people of\r\nthis country than almost any other man now engaging public\r\nattention.'\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of my speech there was a tremendous demonstration,\r\nand General Prentiss seconded the nomination.  General Logan received\r\nsixty-three and one-half votes on the first ballot, and sixty-one\r\nvotes on the second and third ballots.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the third ballot, I received this telegram from\r\nGeneral Logan, who was in Washington:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., _June 6, 1884_.\r\n\r\n\"To Senator Cullom, Convention Hall, Chicago, Ill.:\"\r\n\r\n\"The Republicans of the States that must be relied upon to elect\r\nthe President having shown a preference for Mr. Blaine, I deem it\r\nmy duty not to stand in the way of the people's choice, and recommend\r\nmy friends to assist in his nomination.\r\n\r\n  \"John A. Logan.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Illinois was called on the fourth ballot, I attempted to read\r\nthe telegram to the convention, but a point of order was raised by\r\nSenator Burrows, which the Chair sustained.  It was thoroughly well\r\nunderstood in the convention that I had such a telegram, and after\r\nthe chair sustained the point of order I made the following statement:\r\n\"The Illinois delegation withdraws the name of General John A.\r\nLogan, and gives for Blaine thirty-four votes, for Logan seven,\r\nand for Arthur three.\"\r\n\r\nThis announcement was punctuated with another deafening outburst,\r\nand Blaine was nominated amidst great enthusiasm.  After I withdrew\r\nGeneral Logan's name and cast the vote for Blaine the result was\r\na foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nThere was immediately a strong disposition to place Logan on the\r\nticket as our candidate for Vice-President.  There was considerable\r\ndoubt as to whether he would accept.  Finally he sent a telegram\r\nin which he said:  \"The Convention must do what they think best\r\nunder the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nHe was then nominated for Vice-President without much opposition.\r\n\r\nIt was a superb ticket, and every one thought it would sweep the\r\ncountry.  Blaine, in the opinion of many people, was the most\r\npopular statesman since the days of Henry Clay; Logan, the greatest\r\nvolunteer officer of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nI do not, however, believe that Blaine and Logan got along very\r\nwell together in the campaign.  In my opinion Logan felt that he\r\nwould have been a stronger candidate for the Presidency than Blaine,\r\nas after events proved that he would.  Had Logan headed the ticket,\r\nthere would have been none of the scandal nor charges of corruption\r\nthat were made in the campaign with Blaine at the head.  There\r\nwould have been no \"Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion,\" which in the\r\nopinion of many people resulted in the defeat of Blaine and Logan.\r\n\r\nWhatever the causes, the ticket was defeated; and then came Logan's\r\nfamous fight for re-election to the Senate, continuing three and\r\na half months, the Legislature being tied; but the fight ended by\r\na rather clever trick on the part of Dan Shepard and S. H. Jones\r\nof Springfield, in electing by a \"still hunt\" a Republican in the\r\nthirty-fourth District to succeed a Democrat who died during the\r\nsession, and finally on May 19, 1885, I received a telegram from\r\nLogan while in New York saying, \"I have been elected.\"\r\n\r\nThree or four days before General Logan's death he and Mrs. Logan\r\nwere at my house to dinner, to meet some friends--General and Mrs.\r\nHenderson and Senator Allison.  After dinner, we were in the smoking-\r\nroom.  General Logan was talking about the book he had recently\r\nwritten, showing a conspiracy on the part of the South, entitled\r\n\"The Great Conspiracy.\"  He had sent each of us a copy of the book,\r\nand he remarked that he ventured to say that neither of us had read\r\na word of it; the truth was that we had not, and we admitted it.\r\n\r\nGeneral and Mrs. Logan went home a little early, because he was\r\nthen suffering with rheumatism.  They invited Mrs. Cullom and me\r\nto dinner the following Sunday evening.  General Logan had grown\r\nworse, and he could not attend at the table, but rested on a couch\r\nin an adjoining room.  He never recovered, and passed away some\r\ntwo or three days afterward.  I was present at his death-bed.  The\r\nlast words he uttered were, \"Cullom, I am terribly sick.\"\r\n\r\nThe death of no other General, with the possible exception of\r\nGeneral Grant, was so sorrowfully and universally mourned by the\r\nvolunteer soldiery of the Union as was the death of General Logan.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nGENERAL JOHN M. PALMER\r\n\r\nGeneral Palmer had a long, varied, and honorable career, beginning\r\nas an Anti-Nebraska Democrat in the State Senate of Illinois, in\r\n1855, and ending as a Gold Democrat in the United States Senate in\r\n1897, after being for a time a Republican.\r\n\r\nI first met him as a member of the State Senate, in which service\r\nhe showed considerable ability.  His one leading characteristic,\r\nI should say, was his independence, without any regard to what\r\nparty he might belong to or what the question might be.  He would\r\nnot yield his own convictions to his party.  If the party to which\r\nhe belonged differed from him on any question, he did not hesitate\r\nto abandon it and join the opposition party; and this change he\r\ndid make several times during his public career.  He was one of\r\nthe four Anti-Nebraska Democrats in the Legislature of 1855, who\r\nmight be said to have defeated Lincoln for the Senate by supporting\r\nTrumbull, until it became apparent that if Lincoln continued as a\r\ncandidate, Governor Matteson would be elected.  Lincoln sacrificed\r\nhimself to insure the election of Judge Trumbull, a Free-soiler.\r\nThe other Anti-Nebraska Democrats, who with General Palmer, elected\r\nTrumbull, were Norman B. Judd, Burton C. Cook, G. T. Allen, and\r\nHenry S. Baker, the last two from Madison County.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other General Palmer resigned from the Senate.\r\nHe was one of the first to join the Republican party.  He was a\r\ndelegate to the first Republican State Convention of Illinois.  I\r\nattended that convention, and recall that General Palmer made quite\r\nan impression on the assemblage, in discussing some question with\r\nGeneral Turner, himself quite an able man, and then Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives of the Illinois Legislature.  Intellectually,\r\nGeneral Palmer was a superior man, but he lacked stability of\r\njudgment.  You were never quite sure that you could depend on him,\r\nor feel any certainty as to what course he would take on any\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nHis qualifications as a lawyer were not exceptional, nevertheless\r\nI would rather have had him as my attorney to try a bad case than\r\nalmost any lawyer I ever knew; his talent for manipulating a jury\r\nnearly, if not quite, offset all his legal shortcomings.\r\n\r\nGeneral Palmer was well known as the friend of the colored people,\r\nboth individually and as a race.  His sympathy for them was so\r\nthoroughly understood, that whenever a colored man had an important\r\ncase, or whenever there was a case involving the rights of the\r\ncolored people--such, for instance, as the school question of Alton\r\n--General Palmer was appealed to, and he would take the case, no\r\nmatter how much trouble and how little remuneration there would be\r\nin it for him.\r\n\r\nHe started out as a Democrat, but became a strong Republican, and\r\nso continued for many years; but finally he became dissatisfied\r\nwith the Republican party and left it to support Tilden for President.\r\nHe continued a Democrat, being elected to the United State Senate\r\nas such; but he left the regular organization of that party, and\r\nbecame the head of the Gold Democracy, was its candidate for\r\nPresident, and as such advised his friends to vote for McKinley.\r\n\r\nHe was the Republican Governor of Illinois during the great Chicago\r\nfire.  He acted with the poorest kind of judgment in his controversy\r\nwith General Sheridan and the National Administration, for using\r\nthe Federal troops in Chicago to protect the lives and property of\r\nthe people of that stricken city.  He had visited Chicago, witnessed\r\nthe splendid work which the troops were doing, seemed to be satisfied,\r\nreturned to Springfield, and commenced a quarrel with General\r\nSheridan and President Grant over the right of the National\r\nAdministration to send troops into Chicago, and this quarrel finally\r\nbecame so bitter that it was one of the reasons for his leaving\r\nthe Republican party.\r\n\r\nGeneral Palmer had a fairly good record as an officer during the\r\nCivil War; but he did far better at the head of the Department of\r\nKentucky than he did as a fighting general.  He was a native\r\nKentuckian, understood the people, was a man of good nature and\r\nconsiderable tact, and handled that trying situation very much to\r\nthe satisfaction of Mr. Lincoln.  He might have had a brilliant\r\nrecord as a general had it not been for his unfortunate controversy\r\nwith General Sherman at the capture of Atlanta, which resulted in\r\nhis resigning his command as the head of the Fourteenth Army Corps,\r\nand being granted leave to return to Illinois, there to await\r\nfurther orders.  General Sherman says of this incident in his\r\nmemoirs:\r\n\r\n\"I placed the Fourteenth Corps (Palmer's) under General Schofield's\r\norders.  This corps numbered at the time 17,288 infantry and 826\r\nartillery; but General Palmer claimed to rank General Schofield in\r\nthe date of commission as Major-General, and denied the latter's\r\nright to exercise command over him.  General Palmer was a man of\r\nability, but was not enterprising.  His three divisions were compact\r\nand strong, well commanded, admirable on the defensive but slow to\r\nmove or to act on the offensive.  His corps had sustained up to\r\nthe time fewer hard knocks than any other corps in the whole army,\r\nand I was anxious to give it a chance.  I always expected to have\r\na desperate fight to get possession of the Macon Road, which was\r\nthen the vital objective of the campaign.  Its possession by us\r\nwould in my judgment result in the capture of Atlanta and give us\r\nthe fruits of victory. . . . On the fourth of August I ordered\r\nGeneral Schofield to make a bold attack on the railroad, anywhere\r\nabout East Point, and ordered General Palmer to report to him for\r\nduty.  He at once denied General Schofield's right to command him;\r\nbut, after examining the dates of their respective commissions,\r\nand hearing their arguments, I wrote to General Palmer:\r\n\r\n'From the statements made by yourself and General Schofield to-day,\r\nmy decision is, that he ranks you as a Major-General, being of the\r\nsame date of present commission, by reason of his previous superior\r\nrank as a brigadier-general.  The movements of to-morrow are so\r\nimportant that the orders of the superior on that flank must be\r\nregarded as military orders and not in the nature of co-operation.\r\nI did hope that there would be no necessity for my making this\r\ndecision, but it is better for all parties interested that no\r\nquestion of rank should occur in actual battle.  The Sandtown Road\r\nand the railroad if possible must be gained to-morrow if it costs\r\nhalf your command.  I regard the loss of time this afternoon as\r\nequal to the loss of two thousand men.'\r\n\r\n\"I also communicated the substance of this to General Thomas, to\r\nwhose army Palmer's corps belonged, who replied on the fifth:\r\n\r\n'I regret to hear that Palmer has taken the course he has, and I\r\nknow that he intends to offer his resignation as soon as he can\r\nproperly do so.  I recommend that his application be granted.'\r\n\r\n\"On the fifth I again wrote to General Palmer, arguing the point\r\nwith him, as a friend, not to resign at that crisis lest his motives\r\nmight be misconstrued and because it might damage his future career\r\nin civil life; but at the same time I felt it my duty to say to\r\nhim that the operations on that flank during the fourth and fifth\r\nhad not been satisfactory, not imputing to him any want of energy\r\nor skill, but insisting that the events did not keep pace with my\r\ndesires. . . .\r\n\r\n\"I sanctioned the movement and ordered two of Palmer's divisions\r\nto follow in support of Schofield, and summoned General Palmer to\r\nmeet me in person.  He came on the sixth to my headquarters and\r\ninsisted on his resignation being accepted, for which formal act\r\nI referred him to General Thomas.  He then rode to General Thomas's\r\ncamp, where he made a written resignation of his office as commander\r\nof the Fourteenth Corps and was granted the usual leave of absence\r\nto go to his home in Illinois, there to await further orders.\"\r\n\r\nI quote freely from General Sherman on this incident, as I do not\r\nwant to do General Palmer an injustice.  No one for a moment doubted\r\nGeneral Palmer's bravery, and I must say that it took a brave man,\r\nand I might add an extraordinarily stubborn man, to resign a\r\nmagnificent command just before one of the great movements of the\r\nwar on a mere question of some other general's outranking him.\r\n\r\nI happened to be on the same ferry-boat crossing from St. Louis\r\nwith General Palmer when he was taken home ill.  He had brought a\r\ncolored servant with him, who accompanied him to his home in\r\nCarlinville.  It created considerable excitement, and General Palmer\r\nwas indicted for bringing the colored man into the State.  There\r\nwas not much disposition to try him, but he insisted on being placed\r\non trial, conducted his own defence, and was acquitted.\r\n\r\nHe made an honest, conscientious Governor, but did not work in\r\nharmony with the Legislature.  He vetoed more bills than any Governor\r\nbefore or since.  His vetoes became too common to bear any influence,\r\nand a great many of the bills were passed over his veto.\r\n\r\nI was very much opposed to his renomination.  I supported Governor\r\nOglesby, and I prepared a letter, to be signed by members of the\r\nLegislature, asking Governor Oglesby to be a candidate.  Furthermore,\r\nan agent was employed to go to Decatur to remain there until the\r\nobtained a favorable reply from Oglesby, and then go to Chicago\r\nand have the letter and reply published in the Chicago papers.\r\n\r\nThe scheme worked successfully.  Governor Oglesby was nominated\r\nand elected.\r\n\r\nOglesby, Palmer, Logan, and Yates were all ambitious to go to the\r\nSenate, and were rivals for the place at one time or another, and\r\nthey all succeeded in their ambition, Palmer being the last.  When\r\nGovernor Yates was a candidate, in 1865, Senator Palmer thought\r\nthat he should have been elected.  I liked Governor Yates and\r\nbelieved that his record as Governor entitled him to a seat in the\r\nSenate.  Governor Palmer complained of me for taking any active\r\npart in the contest, and thought that as I was a member of Congress\r\nI should remain neutral.  In those days Governor Palmer and I were\r\nnot on very friendly terms, although after he came to the Senate\r\nwe became quite intimate.  He had a struggle in securing his election\r\nas Senator.  It was a long contest, but he was finally successful.\r\n\r\nGeneral Palmer was very popular with his colleagues in the Senate.\r\nHe was one of the best _raconteurs_ in the Senate, and he delighted\r\nto sit in the smoking-room, or in his committee room, entertaining\r\nthose about him with droll stories.  During his term he made some\r\nvery able speeches, and was always sound on the money question.\r\nHe was consistently in harmony with President Cleveland, and\r\nconsequently he controlled the patronage in the State.  He was a\r\nman of great good heart, full of generosity and good humor; and\r\naltogether it would have been impossible to have a more agreeable\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\nWe had been neighbors in Springfield, and when General Palmer was\r\nelected to the Senate, he felt quite free to write to me.  I retain\r\nthe letter and quote it here:\r\n\r\n  \"Springfield, _March 14, 1891_.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. S. M. Cullom,\r\n  \"Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir:--\r\n\r\n\"I am just in receipt of your kind favor of the eleventh inst.,\r\nand thank you for its friendly and neighborly expressions.  More\r\nthan once since my election, Mrs. Palmer has expressed the hope\r\nthat when she meets Mrs. Cullom at Washington, or here, they may\r\ncontinue to enjoy the friendly relations that have so long existed\r\nbetween them, to which I add the expression of my own wish that in\r\nthe future, as in the past, we may be to each other good neighbors\r\nand good friends.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what the usage is in such cases, but I suppose I\r\nmight forward my credentials at an early date to the Secretary of\r\nthe Senate, who is, I believe, my old army friend, Gen. Anson G.\r\nMcCook.  If such is the proper course I would be glad to do so\r\nthrough you, if agreeable to you.  I will depend upon you also for\r\nsuch information as your experience will enable you to furnish me.\r\nI will be glad to know about what time you will probably leave\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, very respectfully,\r\n  \"John M. Palmer.\"\r\n\r\nWhile General Sherman and General Palmer were not particularly\r\nfriendly, General Palmer was always ready to forgive and forget\r\nand do the agreeable thing.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a celebration in Springfield, where there was\r\na very large crowd, General Sherman was present, and, with General\r\nOglesby and General Palmer, occupied a seat on the platform.\r\nLooking over the crowd, General Palmer recognized General McClernand\r\nin the audience.  McClernand and Sherman were not friends, McClernand\r\nbeing bitterly inimical to Sherman.  General Palmer, thinking only\r\nof doing an agreeable act, at one pushed his way through the crowd\r\nto where General McClernand was seated and invited him to come onto\r\nthe platform.  It was only after a great deal of urging that he\r\nconsented to go, but he finally said, \"I will go, _pro forma_.\"\r\nHe did go \"_pro forma,_\" and paid his respects to General Sherman,\r\nbut remained only a short time.\r\n\r\nGeneral Palmer retired from the Senate at the end of his term, the\r\nLegislature of Illinois being Republican.\r\n\r\nI recollect that I went home from Washington to Springfield, and\r\non arriving there was informed that General Palmer had just died.\r\nI immediately called at the house.  He had only just passed away,\r\nand was still lying on his death-bed.  I attended the funeral at\r\nhis old home in Carlinville, and I do not know that I was ever more\r\nimpressed by such a ceremony.  He was buried with all the pomp\r\nattending a military funeral.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nGOVERNOR RICHARD J. OGLESBY\r\n\r\nI knew the late Governor Oglesby intimately for very many years.\r\nAs a young man, he served as a lieutenant in the gallant Colonel\r\nE. D. Baker's regiment in the Mexican War, was at the battle of\r\nCerro Gordo, and fought the way thence to the City of Mexico.  He\r\nremained with the army until he saw the Stars and Stripes waving\r\nover the hall of the Montezumas.  Returning to Illinois, he took\r\nup again the practice of law; but with the gold fever of 1849 he\r\ntook the pioneers' trail to California, where, in a short time, he\r\nwas financially successful, then returned home, and later went on\r\nan extended tour through the Holy Land, where he remained nearly\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\nOn his return home, in 1860, he was elected to the State Senate.\r\nI recall the night the returns came in.  He had a fisticuff encounter\r\nwith \"Cerro Gordo\" Williams, in which he came out victorious, having\r\nknocked Williams into the gutter.  By many of the onlookers this\r\nwas regarded as the first fight of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nWith his military experience in the Mexican War, it was only natural\r\nthat he should be one of the first to enlist for service in the\r\nCivil War.  He resigned from the Senate, raised a regiment, was\r\nappointed its Colonel, and participated in a number of important\r\nengagements under General Grant, acquitting himself with great\r\nhonor at Donelson, and was subsequently appointed a Brigadier-\r\nGeneral.  He was severely wounded at Corinth, and his active service\r\nin the Civil War was over.  Although he was elevated to the rank\r\nof Major-General, he was assigned to duty at Washington, where he\r\nremained until 1864, and saw no more service on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed the distinction of being elected Governor of Illinois\r\nthree times, first in 1864, again in 1872, resigning the following\r\nyear, after having been elected to the United States Senate; and\r\nafter he had served one term in the Senate and retired to private\r\nlife, he was again elected Governor of Illinois in 1884.\r\n\r\nGovernor Oglesby was a remarkable man in many respects.  Judged by\r\nthe standards of Lincoln and Grant, he was not a great man.  In\r\nsome respects he was a man of far more than ordinary ability.  He\r\nwas a wonderfully eloquent speaker, and I have heard him on occasion\r\nmove audiences to a greater extent than almost any orator, aside\r\nfrom the late Robert G. Ingersoll.\r\n\r\nI have already referred, in these reminiscences, to the speech he\r\ndelivered at the Philadelphia Convention of 1872.  He produced a\r\ngreater impression on that assemblage than any orator who spoke.\r\nOn rare occasions he would utter some of the most beautiful\r\nsentiments.  For instance, his speech on \"Corn\" at Chicago was a\r\nmasterpiece in its way.  But generally speaking, with all his\r\neloquence, he seldom delivered a speech that would read well in\r\nprint; hence it was that his speeches were hardly ever reported.\r\nHis earnestness, his appearance, his gestures, his personality,\r\nall carried the audience with him, as much as, if not more, than\r\nthe actual words he used, and hence it was that when a speech\r\nappeared in print, one was very apt to be disappointed.\r\n\r\nHis record in the Civil War was honorable, but not exceptional.\r\nHe was not the dashing, brilliant soldier that General Logan was,\r\nand I may remark here in passing that after the war was over there\r\nwas considerable jealousy between General Logan and General Oglesby.\r\nThey were rivals in politics.  On one occasion both Governor Oglesby\r\nand General Logan made each a splendid address, and each was cheered\r\nto the echo by the audience, but Governor Oglesby sat silent and\r\nglowering when the audience applauded General Logan, and General\r\nLogan occupied the same attitude when the audience cheered Governor\r\nOglesby.  I was present, and was glad to cheer them both.\r\n\r\nUnder the administration of General Oglesby, as Governor, the\r\naffairs of the State were administered in an honest, businesslike\r\nmanner.  There was no scandal or thought of scandal, so far as the\r\nExecutive was concerned, during all the years that he was Governor,\r\nalthough there was considerable corruption in one or two of the\r\nLegislatures, and some very bad measures were passed over his veto.\r\n\r\nHaving been a Major-General in the Civil War, and considering his\r\nexcellent record as Governor, his popularity, his eloquence, it\r\nseemed certain that Governor Oglesby would take his place as one\r\nof the foremost United States Senators, when he entered the Senate\r\nin 1873; but strange to say, his service in that body added nothing\r\nto the reputation he had made as a soldier and as Governor of\r\nIllinois; indeed, I am not sure but that it detracted from rather\r\nthan added to his reputation.  Perhaps too much was expected of\r\nhim.  The environment did not suit him.  His style of oratory was\r\nneither appreciated nor appropriate to a calm, deliberative body\r\nsuch as the United States Senate.  He did not have the faculty of\r\ndisposing of business.  As Chairman of the Committee on Pensions,\r\nhe was so conscientious that he wanted to examine every little\r\ndetail of the hundreds of cases before his committee, and would\r\nnot trust even the routine to his subordinates.  The result was\r\nthe business of the committee was far behind, much to the\r\ndissatisfaction of Senators.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that Governor Oglesby ever did feel at home in\r\nthe Senate; but nevertheless he was much chagrined at his defeat,\r\nand retired reluctantly.\r\n\r\nBut he was soon again elected Governor of Illinois, a place that\r\nsuited him much better than the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nHis honesty, his patriotism, his earnest eloquence, the uniqueness\r\nof his character, made him beloved by the people of his State; and\r\nwherever he went, to the day of his death, Uncle Dick Oglesby, as\r\nhe was called, was enthusiastically and affectionately received.\r\n\r\nHe was a true Republican from the very beginning of the party,\r\nalthough toward the end of his life I do not believe that he was\r\nquite satisfied with the expansion policy of the party.\r\n\r\nThe last campaign in which he took an active part was that of 1896.\r\nOwing to his advanced years and failing health, and perhaps being\r\nsomewhat dissatisfied with our candidate for Governor, it took\r\nconsiderable urging to induce him to enter that campaign actively;\r\nbut when it was arranged that all the living ex-Governors of Illinois\r\n--Oglesby, Beveridge, Fifer, Hamilton, and myself--should tour the\r\nState on a special train, he consented to join, and christened the\r\nexpedition \"The Flying Squadron.\"  He did his full part in speaking,\r\nand seemed to enjoy keenly the enthusiasm with which he was everywhere\r\nreceived.  He was particularly bitter in his denunciation of Mr.\r\nBryan--even to the extent of using profanity (to which he was much\r\naddicted), greatly to the delight of the thousands of people whom\r\nhe addressed.\r\n\r\nGovernor Oglesby was one of the most delightfully entertaining\r\nconversationalists whom one would wish to meet.  He will go down\r\nin the history of Illinois, as one of the most popular men among\r\nthe people of our State.\r\n\r\nLate in life Governor Oglesby took up a church affiliation.  It\r\nalways seemed strange to me, in his later life, that a man of his\r\nundoubted bravery should have such a perfect horror of death, which\r\nwas an obsession with him.  To his intimate friends he constantly\r\ntalked of it.  It was not the physical pain of dying; with a man\r\nof his pronounced religious convictions it could not have been the\r\nuncertainty of the hereafter.  What was the basis of the fear I\r\ncannot imagine--but certain it is, I do not remember ever knowing\r\na man who seemed to have such a fear of death.\r\n\r\nAt an advanced age, he passed away peacefully and painlessly at\r\nhis beautiful home at Elkhart, Illinois, mourned by the people of\r\nthe whole State, whom he had served so long and faithfully and well.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nSENATORIAL CAREER\r\n1883 to 1911\r\n\r\nAfter I was re-elected Governor of Illinois, in 1880, my friends\r\nin the State urged me to become a candidate for the United States\r\nSenate to succeed the late Hon. David Davis, whose term expired\r\nMarch 3, 1883.  I finally consented.  There were several candidates\r\nagainst me, Governor Richard Oglesby and General Thomas J. Henderson\r\nbeing the two most prominent.  It was not much of a contest, and\r\nI had no serious struggle to secure the caucus nomination.  The\r\nobjection was then raised in the Legislature itself that I was not\r\neligible under the Constitution of our State for election to the\r\nUnited States Senate while I was serving as Governor of Illinois.\r\nThe point looked somewhat serious to me, and I consulted with my\r\nfriend, the Hon. Wm. J. Calhoun, then a member of the Legislature,\r\nlater Minister to China, for whose ability I had the most profound\r\nrespect.  I asked him to give attention to the subject and, if he\r\nagreed with me that I was eligible, to make the fight on the floor\r\nof the House.  He looked into it and came to the conclusion there\r\nwas no doubt as to my eligibility.  He made a speech in the\r\nLegislature, which was regarded then as one of the ablest efforts\r\never delivered on the floor of the House, and he carried the\r\nLegislature with him.  When the time came, I received the vote of\r\nevery Republican member of both Houses, excepting one, the Hon.\r\nGeo. E. Adams.  He was thoroughly conscientious in voting against\r\nme, and did so from no ulterior motive, as he honestly believed\r\nthat I was not eligible.  We became very good friends afterwards,\r\nand I never harbored any ill feeling against him on account of that\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nI appreciated the high distinction conferred upon me by the people\r\nof the State, through the Legislature, in electing me to the United\r\nStates Senate, but I confess that I felt considerable regret on\r\nleaving the Governorship, as during my six years I had enjoyed the\r\nwork and had endeavored to the best of my ability to give to the\r\npeople of my State a businesslike administration.\r\n\r\nI retired from the office of Governor on February 5, 1883, and\r\nremained in Springfield until sworn in as a member of the Senate,\r\nDecember 4, 1883.  General Arthur was President at that time, having\r\nsucceeded to the office after the assassination of General Garfield.\r\n\r\nI liked General Arthur very much.  I had met him once or twice\r\nbefore.  I went with my staff to attend the Yorktown celebration,\r\nand I may remark here that it was the first and only time during\r\nmy service of six years as Governor on which my whole military\r\nstaff accompanied me.  We stopped in Washington to pay our respects\r\nto the President.  It was soon after the assassination of General\r\nGarfield, and Arthur had not yet moved into the White House.  He\r\nwas living in the old Butler place just south of the Capitol, and\r\nI called on him there and presented the members of my staff to him.\r\nThe President was exceedingly polite, as he always was, and was\r\nquite interested, having been a staff officer himself, by appointment\r\nof Governor Morgan of New York.  We were all very much impressed\r\nwith the dignity of the occasion and the kindly attention the\r\nPresident showed us.\r\n\r\nGeneral Arthur had taken considerable interest in New York politics\r\nand belonged to the Conkling faction.  He came into the office of\r\nPresident under the most trying circumstances.  The party was almost\r\ntorn asunder by factional troubles in New York and elsewhere.\r\nBlaine, the bitter enemy of Conkling, had been made the Secretary\r\nof State; Garfield had made some appointments very obnoxious to\r\nConkling--among them the Collector of the Port of New York--and,\r\ngenerally, conditions were very unsatisfactory.  Arthur entered\r\nthe office bent on restoring harmonious conditions in the party,\r\nas far as he could.  He did not allow himself to be controlled by\r\nany faction, but seemed animated by one desire, and that was to\r\ngive a good administration and unite the party.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of great sense of propriety and dignity, believing\r\nmore thoroughly in the observance of the etiquette which should\r\nsurround a President than any other occupant of the White House\r\nwhom I have known.  He was very popular with those who came into\r\ncontact with him, and especially was he popular with the members\r\nof the House and Senate.  I have always thought that he should have\r\nbeen accorded the honor of a nomination for President in 1884; as\r\na matter of fact most of the Republican Senators agreed with me,\r\nand many of us went to the National Convention at Chicago, determined\r\nto nominate him; but we soon found there was no chance, and that\r\nthe nomination would go to Blaine.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur was very kind to me in the way of patronage.  He\r\nnot only recognized my endorsement for Federal offices in my State,\r\nbut gave me a number of appointments outside.  One of the first of\r\nthese was the appointment of Judge Zane as Territorial Judge of\r\nUtah.  President Arthur showed his confidence in me by appointing\r\nJudge Zane, without any endorsement, excepting a statement of his\r\nqualifications, written by me on a scrap of paper in the Executive\r\nOffice.  The Senate Committee on the Judiciary called on the\r\nPresident for the endorsements of Judge Zane, and Senator Edmunds\r\nwas quite disgusted when the President could send him only this\r\nlittle slip of paper written by me, which was all the President\r\nhad when he made the appointment.  Senator Edmunds hesitated to\r\nrecommend his confirmation.  There was no question about Judge\r\nZane's qualifications.  He had been a circuit judge in our State\r\nfor many years.  I saw Senator Teller, whom I knew, and who knew\r\nsomething of Judge Zane, and asked him to help us, as he could do,\r\nbeing then Secretary of the Interior.  On one occasion I spoke to\r\nTeller about Judge Zane, and purposely spoke so loud that Senator\r\nEdmunds could hear me.  I said, among other things, there had not\r\nbeen a man nominated for Territorial Judge in the country who was\r\nbetter qualified for the position.  Judge Zane's nomination was\r\nsoon reported from the committee and confirmed.  He made a great\r\nrecord on the Bench and did much to break up the practice of\r\npolygamy.  He is still living, a resident of Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nI entered the Senate at a very uninteresting period in our history.\r\nThe excitement and bitterness caused by the Civil War and Reconstruction\r\nhad subsided.  It was what I would term a period of industrial\r\ndevelopment, and there were no great measures before Congress.\r\nThe men who then composed the membership of the Senate were honest\r\nand patriotic, trying to do their duty as best they could, but\r\nthere was no great commanding figure.  The days of Webster, Clay,\r\nand Calhoun had passed; the great men of the Civil War period were\r\ngone.  Stevens, Sumner, Chase of the Reconstruction era, had all\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nAmong the leaders at the beginning of the Forty-eighth Congress\r\nwere Senators Aldrich and Anthony, of Rhode Island; Edmunds and\r\nMorrill, of Vermont; Sherman and Pendleton, of Ohio; Sewell, of\r\nNew Jersey; Don Cameron, of Pennsylvania; Platt and Hawley, of\r\nConnecticut; Harrison, of Indiana; Dawes and Hoar, of Massachusetts;\r\nAllison, of Iowa; Ingalls, of Kansas; Hale and Frye, of Maine;\r\nSawyer, of Wisconsin; Van Wyck and Manderson, of Nebraska; all on\r\nthe Republican side.  There were a number of quite prominent\r\nDemocrats--Bayard, of Delaware; Voorhees, of Indiana; Morgan, of\r\nAlabama; Ransom and Vance, of North Carolina; Butler and Hampton,\r\nof South Carolina; Beck, of Kentucky; Lamar and George, of Mississippi;\r\nand Cockrell and Vest, of Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe Senate was controlled by the Republicans, there being forty\r\nRepublican and thirty-six Democratic Senators; and Senator George\r\nF. Edmunds, of Vermont, was chosen President _pro tempore_.  In\r\nthe House the Democrats had the majority, and John G. Carlisle was\r\nchosen Speaker.\r\n\r\nSenator Edmunds is still living, and he has been for many years\r\nregarded as one of the foremost lawyers of the American bar.  I\r\nknow that in the Senate when I entered it, he was ranked as its\r\nleading lawyer.  He was chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary\r\nof the Senate and, with Senator Thurman, of Ohio, dominated that\r\ncommittee.  I became very intimately acquainted with him.  He was\r\ndignified in his conversation and deportment, and I never knew him\r\nto say a vicious thing in debate.\r\n\r\nI believe I had considerable influence with Senator Edmunds.  He\r\nalways seemed to have a prejudice against appropriations for the\r\nRock Island (Illinois) Arsenal.  He had never visited Rock Island,\r\nbut he seemed to think that the money spent there was more or less\r\nwasted, and he was disposed to oppose appropriations for its\r\nmaintenance.  One day we were considering an appropriation bill\r\ncarrying several items in favor of Rock Island, and I anticipated\r\nSenator Edmunds' objections.  Sitting beside him, I asked him not\r\nto oppose these items.  I told him that I did not think he was\r\ndoing right by such a course.  He asked me where they were in the\r\nbill and I showed them to him without saying a word.  Just before\r\nwe reached them I observed him rising from his seat and leaving\r\nthe chamber.  He remained away until the items were passed, then\r\nhe returned, and the subject was never mentioned between us\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nSenator Edmunds resigned before his last term expired.  There were\r\ntwo reasons for his resignation, the principal one being the illness\r\nof his only daughter; but in addition, he had come to feel that\r\nthe Senate was becoming less and less desirable each year, and\r\nbegan to lose interest in it.  He did not like the rough-and-tumble\r\nmethods of debate of a number of Western Senators who were coming\r\nto take a more prominent place in the Senate.  On one occasion\r\nSenator Plumb, of Kansas, attacked Senator Edmunds most violently,\r\nand without any particular reason.\r\n\r\nDuring his service in the Senate, Senator Edmunds seemed to be\r\nfrequently arguing cases before the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.  His ability as a lawyer made him in constant demand in\r\nimportant litigation before that court.  Personally, I do not\r\napprove of Senators of the United States engaging in the active\r\npractice of the law or any other business, but his practice before\r\nthe Supreme Court did not cause him to neglect his Senatorial\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nJustice Miller, one of the ablest members of the court, was talking\r\nwith me one day about Senator Edmunds, and he asked me why I did\r\nnot come into the Supreme Court to practise, remarking that Edmunds\r\nwas there a good deal.  I replied that I did not know enough law,\r\nto begin with; and in addition it did not seem to me proper for a\r\nSenator of the United States to engage in that kind of business.\r\nJustice Miller replied that Senators did do so, and that there\r\nseemed to be no complaint about it, and he urged me to come along,\r\nsaying that he would take care of me.  But needless for me to say,\r\nI never appeared in any case before the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates during my service as Senator.\r\n\r\nSenator Edmunds' colleague, Justin S. Morrill, was one of the most\r\nlovable characters I ever met.  I served with him in the House.\r\nLater he was a very prominent member of the Senate, when I entered\r\nit, and was Chairman of the Committee on Finance.  He was a\r\nwonderfully capable man in legislation.  He had extraordinary power\r\nin originating measures and carrying them through.  He was not a\r\nlawyer, but was a man of exceptional common sense.  His judgment\r\nwas good on any proposition.  I do not believe he had an enemy in\r\nthe Senate.  Every one felt kindly toward him, and for this reason\r\nit was very easy for him to secure the passage of any bill he was\r\ninterested in.\r\n\r\nWhile Senator Morrill was chairman of the Committee on Finance,\r\nowing to his advanced age and the feeble condition of his health\r\nthe real burden of the committee for years before his death fell\r\non Nelson W. Aldrich, of Rhode Island.  He was prominent as far\r\nback as the Forty-eighth Congress, and was a dominant unit even\r\nthen.  His recent retirement is newspaper history and need not be\r\naired here.\r\n\r\nSenator Aldrich has had a potent influence in framing all tariff\r\nand financial legislation almost from the time he entered the\r\nSenate.  Personally, I have great admiration for him and for his\r\ngreat ability and capacity to frame legislation, and it is a matter\r\nof sincere regret with me that he has determined to retire to\r\nprivate life.  His absence is seriously felt, especially in the\r\nFinance Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John Sherman, of Ohio, was one of the most valuable\r\nstatesmen of his day and one of the ablest men.  He was exceedingly\r\nindustrious, and well posted on all financial questions.  Toward\r\nthe close of his Senatorial term, he failed rapidly, but he was\r\njust as clear on any financial question as he was at any time in\r\nhis career.  He was Secretary of the Treasury when in his prime,\r\nand I believe his record in the office stands second only to\r\nHamilton's.  He was of the Hamilton school of financiers, and his\r\njudgment was always reliable and trustworthy.  He was a very serious\r\nman and could never see through a joke.  He was one of the very\r\nbest men in Ohio, and would have made a splendid President.  For\r\nyears he was quite ambitious to be President, and the business\r\ninterests of the country seemed to be for him.  His name was before\r\nthe National Convention of the Republican party many times, but\r\ncircumstances always intervened to prevent his nomination when it\r\nwas almost within his grasp.\r\n\r\nI have always thought that one reason was that his own State had\r\nso many ambitious men in it who sought the honor themselves, that\r\nthey were never sincerely in good faith for Sherman.  At least\r\ntwice he went to National Conventions, apparently with his own\r\nState behind him, but he was unfortunate in the selection of his\r\nmanagers, and, really, when the time came to support him they seemed\r\nonly too ready to sacrifice him in their own interests.\r\n\r\nI have always regretted that he closed his career by accepting the\r\noffice of Secretary of State under President McKinley.  It was\r\nunfortunate for him that it was at a most trying and difficult time\r\nthat he entered that department.  The Spanish-American War was\r\ncoming on, and there was necessity for exercising the most careful\r\nand skillful diplomacy.  Senator Sherman's training and experience\r\nlay along other lines.  He was not in any sense a diplomat, and\r\nhis age unfitted him for the place.  He retired from office very\r\nsoon, and shortly thereafter passed away.  His brief service as\r\nSecretary of State will be forgotten, and he will be remembered as\r\nthe great Secretary of the Treasury, and one of the most celebrated\r\nof Ohio Senators.\r\n\r\nSenator George F. Hoar, of Massachusetts, was quite prominent at\r\nthe beginning of the Forty-eighth Congress.  He was jealous of New\r\nEngland's interests, and was always prejudiced in its favor, and\r\nin favor of New England men and men with New England ancestry, or\r\naffiliations.  He opposed the Interstate Commerce Act because he\r\nthought it would injuriously affect his locality, although he knew\r\nvery well it would be of inestimable benefit to the country as a\r\nwhole.  Senator Hoar was a scholarly man.  Indeed, I would say he\r\nwas the most cultivated man in the Senate.  He was highly educated,\r\nhad travelled extensively, was a student all his life, and in debate\r\nwas very fond of Latin or Greek quotations, and especially so when\r\nhe wanted to make a point perfectly clear to the Senate.  He opposed\r\nimperialism and the acquisition of foreign territory.  He opposed\r\nthe ratification of the treaty of peace with Spain.  When the\r\nPhilippine question was up in the Senate, I made a speech in which\r\nI compared Senator Hoar with his colleague, Senator Lodge, said\r\nthat Senator Lodge had no such fear as did Senator Hoar on account\r\nof the acquirement of non-contiguous territory, and made the remark\r\nthat Senator Hoar was far behind the times.  He was not present\r\nwhen I made the speech, but afterwards read it in the _Record_.\r\nHe came down to my seat greatly out of humor one day and stated\r\nthat if three-fourths of the people of his State were not in harmony\r\nwith his position he would resign.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the most kindly of men, but during this period he\r\nwas so deadly in earnest in opposition to the so-called imperialism\r\nthat he became very ill-natured with his Republican colleagues who\r\ndiffered from him.  I do not know but the passing of time has\r\ndemonstrated that Senator Hoar was right in his opposition to\r\nacquirement of the Philippines; but at the time it seemed that the\r\nburden was thrust upon us and we could not shirk it.\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar was disposed to be against the recognition of the\r\nRepublic of Panama, and it has been intimated that he was of the\r\nopinion that the Roosevelt Administration had something to do with\r\nthe bloodless revolution that resulted in the uniting with the\r\nUnited States of that part of Colombia which now forms the Canal\r\nZone.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt entertained a very high regard for Senator\r\nHoar, and he wanted to disabuse his mind of that impression.  He\r\nasked him to call at his office one morning.  I was waiting to see\r\nthe President and when he came in he told me that he had an engagement\r\nwith Senator Hoar, and asked me if I would wait until he had seen\r\nthe Senator first.  I promptly answered that he should see the\r\nSenator first at any rate, as he was an older man than I, and was\r\nolder in the service.  Senator Hoar and the President entered the\r\nroom together.  Just as they went in, the President turned to me.\r\n\"You might as well come in at the same time,\" said he.  I accompanied\r\nthem.  And this is what took place:\r\n\r\nThe President wanted the Senator to read a message which he had\r\nalready prepared, in reference to Colombia's action in rejecting\r\nthe treaty and the canal in general; which message showed very\r\nclearly that the President had never contemplated the secession of\r\nPanama, and was considering different methods in order to obtain\r\nthe right of way across the Isthmus from Colombia, fully expecting\r\nto deal only with the Colombian Government on the subject.  The\r\nPresident was sitting on the table, first at one side of Senator\r\nHoar, and then on the other, talking in his usual vigorous fashion,\r\ntrying to get the Senator's attention to the message.  Senator Hoar\r\nseemed adverse to reading it, but finally sat down, and without\r\nseeming to pay any particular attention to what he was perusing,\r\nhe remained for a minute or two, then arose and said:  \"I hope I\r\nmay never live to see the day when the interests of my country are\r\nplaced above its honor.\"  He at once retired from the room without\r\nuttering another word, proceeding to the Capitol.\r\n\r\nLater in the morning he came to me with a typewritten paper containing\r\nthe conversation between the President and himself, and asked me\r\nto certify to its correctness.  I took the paper and read it over,\r\nand as it seemed to be correct, as I remembered the conversation,\r\nI wrote my name on the bottom of it.  I have never seen or heard\r\nof the paper since.\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar was very much interested in changing the date of the\r\ninauguration of the President of the United States.  March, in\r\nWashington, is one of the very worst months of the year, and it\r\nfrequently happens that the weather is so cold and stormy as to\r\nmake any demonstration almost impossible.  Inaugurations have cost\r\nthe lives of very many men.  I was looking into the subject myself,\r\nand I took occasion to write Senator Hoar a letter, asking his\r\nviews.  He replied to me very courteously and promptly.  I was so\r\npleased with the letter that I retained it, and give it here.\r\n\r\n  \"Worcester, Mass., _August 26, 1901_.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Senator:--\r\n\r\n\"I do not think the proposed change of time of inauguration can be\r\nmade without change in the Constitution.  I prepared an article\r\nfor so changing the Constitution.  It has passed the Senate twice\r\ncertainly, and I think three times.  It was reported once or twice\r\nfrom the Committee on Privileges and Elections, and once from the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary.  It received general favor in the\r\nSenate, and as I now remember there was no vote against it at any\r\ntime.  The only serious question was whether the four years should\r\nterminate on a certain Wednesday in April or should terminate as\r\nnow on a fixed day of the month.  The former is liable to the\r\nobjection that one Presidential term should be in some cases slightly\r\nlonger than another.  The other is liable to the objection that if\r\nthe thirtieth of April were Sunday or Saturday or Monday, nearly\r\nall persons from a distance who come to the inauguration would have\r\nto be away from home over Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"The matter would, I think, have passed the House, if it could have\r\nbeen reached for action.  But it had the earnest opposition of\r\nSpeaker Reed.  It was, as you know, very hard to get him to approve\r\nanything that was a change.\r\n\r\n\"I have prepared an amendment to be introduced at the beginning of\r\nthe next section, and have got some very carefully prepared tables\r\nfrom the Coast Survey, to show the exact length of an administration\r\nunder the different plans.  The advantage of the change seems to\r\nme very clear indeed.  In the first place, you prolong the second\r\nsession of Congress until the last of April; you add six or seven\r\nweeks, which are very much needed, to that session.  And you can\r\nfurther increase that session a little by special statute, which\r\nshould have Congress meet immediately after the November election,\r\na little earlier than now.  In that case, you can probably without\r\ndisadvantage shorten the first session of Congress so as to get\r\naway by the middle of May or the first of June and get rid of the\r\nvery disagreeable Washington heat.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would throw your great influence, so much increased by\r\nthe renewed expression of the confidence of your State, against\r\nwhat seems to me the most dangerous single proposition now pending\r\nbefore the people, a plan to elect Senators of the United States\r\nby popular vote.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, with high regard, faithfully yours,\r\n  \"Geo. F. Hoar.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. S. M. Cullom,\r\n  \"Chicago, Ills.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Dawes, of Massachusetts, Senator Hoar's colleague, was not\r\nthe cultivated man that Senator Hoar was, and neither would I say\r\nhe was a man of strong and independent character.  He was very\r\npopular in the Senate, probably far more popular with Senators than\r\nhis colleague, and it was much easier for him to pass bills in\r\nwhich he was interested.  He was influential as a legislator and\r\na man of great probity of character.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other--why, I never knew--he was one of the very\r\nfew Eastern Senators of my time who gave special attention to Indian\r\naffairs.  He was chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs for\r\nyears, and was the acknowledged authority on that subject in the\r\nSenate.  When he retired he was placed at the head of the so-called\r\nDawes Commission, having in charge the interests of the tribes of\r\nIndians in Oklahoma and the Indian territory.  He was an honest\r\nman, and having inherited no fortune, he consequently retired from\r\nthe Senate a poor man.  The appointment was very agreeable to him\r\non that account, but it was given to him more especially because\r\nhe knew more about Indian matters than any other man.\r\n\r\nAs I have been writing these recollections of the men with whom I\r\nhave been associated in public life for the last half-century, I\r\nhave had occasion to mention a number of times, Senator Orville H.\r\nPlatt, of Connecticut, who was two years older than I, and who took\r\nhis seat in the Senate in 1879, serving there until his death in\r\n1905.\r\n\r\nWe became very friendly almost immediately after I entered the\r\nSenate.  One bond of friendship between us from the beginning was,\r\nwe each had a senior colleague a celebrated General of Civil War\r\nfame--Hawley, of Connecticut and Logan, of Illinois.  Senator Platt\r\nand I necessarily were compelled to take what might be termed a\r\nback seat, our colleagues being almost always in the lime-light.\r\nAs a member of the select committee on Interstate Commerce, Senator\r\nPlatt rendered much valuable assistance in the investigation and\r\nin the passage of the Act of 1887, although he was almost induced\r\nfinally to oppose it on account of the anti-pooling and the long-\r\nand-short-haul sections.\r\n\r\nHe was a modest man, and it was some years before Senators that\r\nwere not intimate with him really appreciated his worth.  Had he\r\nnot yielded to the late Senator Hoar, he would have been made\r\nchairman of the Committee on the Judiciary instead of Senator Hoar,\r\na position for which there was no Senator more thoroughly qualified\r\nthan Senator Platt.  It seems strange that he never did succeed to\r\nan important chairmanship until he was made chairman of the Committee\r\non Cuban Relations during the war with Spain, and he really made\r\nthat an important committee.  Not only in name but in fact was he\r\nthe author of those very wise pieces of legislation known as the\r\nPlatt Amendments.  I was a member of the Committee on Cuban Relations,\r\nand know whereof I speak in saying that it was Senator Platt who\r\ndrafted these so-called amendments and secured their passage in\r\nthe Senate.  They were finally embodied in the Cuban Constitution,\r\nand also in the treaty between Cuba and the United States.\r\n\r\nAfter the late Senator Dawes retired, Senator Platt was an authority\r\non all matters pertaining to Indian affairs.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed by he became more and more influential in the\r\nSenate.  Every Senator on both sides of the chamber had confidence\r\nin him and in his judgment.  As an orator he was not to be compared\r\nwith Senator Spooner, but he did deliver some very able speeches,\r\nespecially during the debates preceding the Spanish-American War.\r\n\r\nI have often said that Senator Platt was capable in more ways than\r\nany other man in the Senate of doing what the exigencies of the\r\nday from time to time put upon him.  He was always at his post of\r\nduty, always watchful in caring for the interests of the country,\r\nalways just and fair to all alike, and ever careful and conservative\r\nin determining what his duty should be in the disposition of any\r\npublic question; and I regarded his judgment as a little more\r\nexactly right than that of any other Senator.\r\n\r\nGeneral Joseph R. Hawley, of Connecticut, was quite a figure in\r\nthe Senate when I entered it, and was regarded as one of the leaders,\r\nespecially on military matters.  He was a man of fine ability and\r\naddress, brave as a lion and enjoyed an enviable Civil War record.\r\nHe was president of the Centennial at Philadelphia and permanent\r\nPresident of the Republican Convention of 1868, which nominated\r\nGeneral Grant.  He was a very ambitious man, and wanted to be\r\nPresident; several times the delegation from his State presented\r\nhis name to national conventions.  He had no mean idea of his own\r\nmerits; and his colleague, Senator Platt, told me once in a jocular\r\nway that if the Queen of England should announce her purpose of\r\ngiving a banquet to one of the most distinguished citizens from\r\neach nation, and General Hawley should be invited as the most\r\ndistinguished citizen of the United States, he would take it as a\r\nmatter of course.\r\n\r\nSenator F. M. Cockrell and Senator George Vest represented Missouri\r\nin the United States Senate for very many years.\r\n\r\nSenator Cockrell was one of the most faithful and useful legislators\r\nI ever knew.  I served with him for years on the Committee on\r\nAppropriations.  That committee never had a better member.  He kept\r\nclose track of the business of the Senate, and when the calendar\r\nwas called, no measure was passed without his close scrutiny,\r\nespecially any measure carrying an appropriation.  He was a Democrat\r\nall his life, but never allowed partisanship to enter into his\r\naction on legislation.  It was said of him that he used to make\r\none fiery Democratic speech at each Congress, and then not think\r\nof partisanship again.  He was not given much to talking about\r\nviolating the Constitution, because he knew he had been in the\r\nConfederate Army himself and that he had violated it.\r\n\r\nOne day Senator George, who was, by the way, a very able Senator\r\nfrom the South, was making a long constitutional argument against\r\na bill, extending over two or three days.  I happened to be conversing\r\nwith Cockrell at the time, and he remarked:  \"Just listen to George\r\ntalk.  He don't seem to realize that for four years he was violating\r\nthe Constitution himself.\"  Senator Cockrell retired from the Senate\r\nin 1905, his State for the first time in its history having elected\r\na Republican Legislature.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt had the very highest regard for him, and as\r\nsoon as it was known he could not be re-elected, he wired Senator\r\nCockrell, tendering him a place on either the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission or the Panama Canal Commission.  He accepted the former,\r\nserving thereon for one term.  He gave the duties of this position\r\nthe same attention and study that he did when a member of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nSenator Vest was an entirely different style of man.  He did not\r\npay the close attention to the routine work of the Senate that\r\nSenator Cockrell did, but he was honest and faithful to his duty,\r\nand an able man as well.  He was a great orator, and I have heard\r\nhim make on occasion as beautiful speeches as were ever delivered\r\nin the Senate.  At the time of his death he was the last surviving\r\nmember of the Confederate Senate.\r\n\r\nHe told me a rather interesting story once about how he came to\r\nquit drinking whiskey.  He said he came home to Missouri after the\r\nwar, found little to do, and being almost without means, took to\r\ndrinking whiskey pretty hard.  He awoke one night and thought he\r\nsaw a cat sitting on the end of his bed.  He reached down, took up\r\nhis boot-jack and threw it at the cat, as he supposed.  Instead,\r\na pitcher was smashed to atoms.  Needless to add there was no cat\r\nat all, which he realized, and he never took another drink of\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\nSenator Vest was not a very old man, but he was in poor health and\r\nfeeble for his years.  One day he looked particularly forlorn,\r\nsitting at his desk and leaning his head on his hands.  I noticed\r\nhis dejected attitude, and said to Senator Morrill, who was then\r\neighty-five or eighty-six years old:  \"Go over and cheer up Vest.\"\r\nMorrill did so in these words:  \"Vest, what is the matter?  Cheer\r\nup!  Why, you are nothing but a boy.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Vest retired from the Senate, and shortly thereafter died\r\nat his home in Washington.\r\n\r\nAllen G. Thurman, of Ohio, was another very prominent Democrat in\r\nthis Congress.  He was one of the leading lawyers of the Senate,\r\nranking, probably, with Edmunds in this respect.  He was chairman\r\nof the Committee on the Judiciary for a brief period, was later\r\nnominated for Vice-President of the United States, but was defeated\r\nwith the rest of the Democratic ticket.\r\n\r\nSenator Eugene Hale, who retired from the Senate on his own motion,\r\nMarch 4, 1911, was elected in 1881, and was always regarded as a\r\nvery strong man.  It was unfortunate for the Senate and country\r\nthat Senator Hale determined to leave this body.  He was chairman\r\nof the Committee on Appropriations, and chairman of the Republican\r\ncaucus, in which latter capacity I succeeded him in April, 1911.\r\nHe was for years chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs; and\r\nthere is no man in the country, in my judgment, who knows more\r\nabout the work and condition of the Navy and the Navy Department\r\nthan does Senator Hale.  Hence it has been for years past, that\r\nwhen legislation affecting the Navy came up to be acted upon by\r\nCongress, generally we have looked to Senator Hale to direct and\r\ninfluence our legislative action.\r\n\r\nHe is a very independent character, and was just the man for chairman\r\nof the great Committee on Appropriations.  Senator Hale was more\r\nthan ordinarily independent, even to the extent of voting against\r\nhis party at times, and was very little influenced by what a\r\nPresident or an Administration might desire.  I regretted exceedingly\r\nto see him leave the Senate, where for many years he served his\r\ncountry so well.\r\n\r\nCharles F. Manderson, of Nebraska, was twice elected to the United\r\nStates Senate, and was an influential member.  I have regarded him\r\nas one of the most amiable men with whom I have served.  He was a\r\nsplendid soldier, a splendid legislator, and a splendid man generally.\r\nHe was the presiding officer of the Senate, and a good one.  I have\r\nalways thought that he ought to have been the Republican nominee\r\nfor Vice-President of the United States; but for some reason or\r\nother he never seemed to seek the place, and finally became one of\r\nthe attorneys for the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad,\r\nsince when he seems to have lost interest in political affairs.\r\nHe visit old friends in Washington once each year, and it is always\r\na great pleasure for me to greet Mr. and Mrs. Manderson.\r\n\r\nAnother Senator who first served many years in the House, was\r\nPhiletus Sawyer, of Wisconsin.  It was in the Senate that I served\r\nwith him, and came to have for him a very great respect.  He was\r\nnot very well educated, not a lawyer nor an orator, and excepting\r\nin a conversational way, not regarded as a talker; yet he was an\r\nuncommonly effective man in business as well as in politics, and\r\nwas once or twice invited to become chairman of the National\r\nRepublican Committee.\r\n\r\nI cannot resist the temptation to tell a little story in connection\r\nwith Senator Sawyer.  One day he was undertaking to pass an\r\nunimportant bill in the Senate concerning some railroad in his own\r\nState, and as was the custom when he had anything to say or do in\r\nthe Senate, he took his place in the centre aisle close to the\r\nclerk's desk, so that he could be heard.  Senator Van Wyck offered\r\nan amendment to the bill, and was talking in favor of the amendment,\r\nwhen Sawyer became a little alarmed lest the bill was going to be\r\nbeaten.  He turned his back to the clerk, and said in a tone of\r\nvoice that could be distinctly heard:\r\n\r\n\"If you will stop your damned yawp I will accept your amendment.\"\r\n\r\nVan Wyck merely said, \"All right.\"  The amendment was adopted, and\r\nthe bill passed.\r\n\r\nAs is quite the custom in the disposal of new members, I was\r\nappointed a member of the Committee on Pensions--really the only\r\nimportant committee appointment I received during my first service\r\nin the Senate.  I naturally felt very liberal toward the old\r\nsoldiers, and it seemed that every case that was referred to me\r\nwas a worthy one, and that a liberal pension should be allowed.\r\nI became a little uneasy lest I might be too liberal, and I went\r\nto Sawyer, knowing that he was a man of large wealth, seeking his\r\nadvice about it.\r\n\r\nHe said, and I have been guided by that advice largely ever since:\r\n\"You need not worry; you cannot very well make a mistake in allowing\r\nliberal pensions to the soldier boys.  The money will get into\r\ncirculation and come back into the treasury very soon; so go ahead\r\nand do what you think is right in the premises; and there will be\r\nno trouble.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Sawyer retired from the Senate voluntarily at a ripe old\r\nage.  He was largely instrumental in selecting as his successor,\r\none of the greatest lawyers and ablest statesmen who has ever served\r\nin that body, of whom I shall speak later, my distinguished friend,\r\nthe Hon. John C. Spooner.\r\n\r\nIn the Forty-eighth Congress the Democrats had a majority in the\r\nHouse and the Republicans a majority in the Senate, and as is always\r\nthe case when such a situation prevails, little or no important\r\nlegislation was enacted.\r\n\r\nI entered the Senate having three objects in view:  First, the\r\ncontrol of Interstate Commerce; second, the stamping out of polygamy;\r\nthird, the construction of the Hennepin Canal.\r\n\r\nI was not quite as modest as I have since advised younger Senators\r\nto be, because I see by the _Record_ that on January 11, 1884, a\r\nlittle more than a month after I had entered the Senate, I made an\r\nextended address on the subject of Territorial Government for Utah,\r\nparticularly referring to polygamy.  I was especially bitter in\r\nwhat I said against the Mormons and the Mormon Church.  I used such\r\nexpressions as these:\r\n\r\n\"There is scarcely a page of their history that is not marred by\r\na recital of some foul deed.  The whole history of the Mormon Church\r\nabounds in illustrations of the selfishness, deceit, and lawlessness\r\nof its leaders and members.  Founded in fraud, built up by the most\r\naudacious deception, this organization has been so notoriously\r\ncorrupt and immoral in its practices, teachings, and tendencies as\r\nto justify the Government in assuming absolute control of the\r\nTerritory and in giving the Church or its followers no voice in\r\nthe administration of public affairs.  The progress of Mormonism\r\nto its present strength and power has been attended by a continual\r\nseries of murders, robberies, and outrages of every description;\r\nbut there is one dark spot in its disgraceful record that can never\r\nbe effaced, one crime so heinous that the blood of the betrayed\r\nvictims still calls aloud for vengeance.\"\r\n\r\nI introduced a bill on the subject, in which I provided for the\r\nappointment of a legislative council by the President, this council\r\nto have the same legislative power as the legislative assembly of\r\na Territory.  I distrusted the local Legislature because it was\r\ndominated by men high up in the Mormon Church.\r\n\r\nDuring this Congress I pushed the bill as best I could, but was\r\nnever able to secure its passage.  Laws were passed on the subject,\r\nand the Mormon question is practically now a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nSince that time conditions in Utah and in the Mormon Church have\r\nchanged greatly.  The Prophets received a new revelation declaring\r\npolygamy unlawful, and I believe that the practice has ceased.  As\r\na matter of fact, Judge Zane, the Territorial Judge of Utah, did\r\nmore to stamp it out than any other one man.  He sentenced those\r\nguilty of the practice to terms in the penitentiary, and announced\r\nthat he would continue to do so until they reformed.  I do not\r\nthink that the Church or the Mormon people deserve to-day the severe\r\ncriticism they merited twenty-five years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nCLEVELAND'S FIRST TERM\r\n1884 to 1887\r\n\r\nThe Republican Convention of 1884 was held at Chicago.  The names\r\nof Joseph R. Hawley, John A. Logan, Chester A. Arthur, John Sherman,\r\nGeorge F. Edmunds, and James G. Blaine were presented as candidates\r\nfor the Republican nomination for President of the United States.\r\nBlaine and Logan finally were the nominees, neither of them having\r\nmuch of a contest to secure the nomination for President and Vice-\r\nPresident respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Convention met later, and nominated Grover Cleveland\r\nand Thomas A. Hendricks.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential campaign of 1884 was unique in the extreme.  It\r\nwas the most bitter personal contest in our history.  The private\r\nlives of both candidates, Cleveland and Blaine, were searched, and\r\nthe most scandalous stories circulated, most of which were false.\r\n\r\nThe tide was in favor of Blaine only a short time before the\r\nelection.  I do not intend to go into the cause of his defeat.  It\r\nwas accomplished by a margin so narrow that any one of a dozen\r\nreasons may be given as the particular one.  The Burchard incident,\r\nthe dinner given by the plutocrats at Delmonico's, certainly changed\r\nseveral hundred votes--important when we remember that a change of\r\nless than six hundred votes in the State of New York would have\r\nelected him.  Conkling, too, was accused of playing him false, and\r\nit was alleged that there were hundreds of fraudulent votes cast\r\nin the city of New York and on Long Island.  Colonel A. K. McClure,\r\nin \"Our Presidents and How We Make Them,\" says, with reference to\r\nthis contest:\r\n\r\n\"Blaine would have been matchless in the skilful management of a\r\nPresidential campaign for another, but he was dwarfed by the\r\noverwhelming responsibilities of conducting a campaign for himself,\r\nand yet he assumed the supreme control of the struggle and directed\r\nit absolutely from start to finish.  He was of the heroic mould,\r\nand he wisely planned his campaign tours to accomplish the best\r\nresult.  In point of fact, he had won his fight after stumping the\r\ncountry, and lost it by his stay in New York on his way home.  He\r\nknew how to sway multitudes, and none could approach him in that\r\nimportant feature of a conflict; but he was not trained to consider\r\nthe thousand intricacies that fell upon the management of every\r\nPresidential contest.\"\r\n\r\nGrover Cleveland was inaugurated on the fourth of March, 1885,\r\nbeing the first Democratic President since James Buchanan, who was\r\nelected in 1856, and marking the first defeat of the Republican\r\nparty since the election of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThere was a wild scramble for offices on the part of the Democrats\r\nas soon as Cleveland was inaugurated.  He proceeded to satisfy them\r\nas rapidly as he could, and out of 56,134 Presidential positions\r\nhe appointed 42,992 Democrats.\r\n\r\nI always admired Grover Cleveland.  I first saw him at the time of\r\nhis inaugural address, which he delivered without notes.  He never\r\nfaltered from the beginning to the end, never skipped a line or\r\nmissed a word, or made a false start.  He was the first, and so\r\nfar as I know the only President who did not read his inaugural\r\naddress.  His speeches, his messages, and his public utterances\r\ngenerally all showed that he was a man of extraordinary ability.\r\nHe made a wonderful impression upon the country.  As Chief Executive,\r\nhe was strong-minded and forceful, and adhered to his views on\r\npublic questions with a remarkable degree of tenacity, utterly\r\nregardless of his party.\r\n\r\nHe appointed a very fair cabinet.  There was really no great man\r\nin it, but they were all men of some ability.  The Secretary of\r\nState, Thos. F. Bayard, of Delaware, was one of the prominent\r\nDemocrats of the Senate when I entered it, and had represented his\r\nState in that body for many years.  I believe he conducted the\r\naffairs of the State Department satisfactorily, and he was later\r\nmade Minister to the Court of St. James.\r\n\r\nDaniel Manning, of New York, was Secretary of the Treasury.  And,\r\nreferring to Manning, I am reminded of a little story.\r\n\r\nSoon after he came into the office I had occasion to go to the\r\nTreasury Department on some business.  I saw the office secretary,\r\nwho had been there under the previous Administration, and whom I\r\nknew well.  He informed me that the Secretary of the Treasury was\r\nnot in, but that he would be in a few minutes.  I expressed a desire\r\nto see him and said that I would like very much to be introduced\r\nto him.  Mr. Manning came in presently, and I was introduced, after\r\nwhich I disposed of my business without delay.  Looking around, I\r\nsaw Senator Beck and a number of other Senators, accompanied by a\r\nhorde of Democratic office-seekers from the South, sitting against\r\nthe wall waiting for me to get through with my business.  Beck came\r\nforward, and in a half serious sort of way said to me:  \"You do\r\nnot seem to know that the Administration has changed.  You march\r\nin here and take possession, and we Democrats are sitting here\r\nagainst the wall cooling our heels and waiting for an opportunity\r\nto see the Secretary.  You have seen him already, and are ready to\r\ngo.\"  It did plague me a little, as I was not quite sure whether\r\nBeck was in earnest or not.  He soon returned to the Senate from\r\nthe Treasury, and coming into the Senate Chamber a little later I\r\nfound that he had been telling my colleagues how he had \"plagued\r\nCullom\" and how Cullom was much embarrassed about it.  He considered\r\nit quite a joke on me.\r\n\r\nL. Q. C. Lamar, of Mississippi, was made Secretary of the Interior.\r\nLamar was also one of the prominent Democrats of the Senate when\r\nI entered it.  I had the very greatest respect for him as a Senator\r\nand as a man.  Later, Mr. Cleveland nominated him for Associate\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court.  The nomination pended before the\r\nJudiciary Committee for a long time, as it was well known that Mr.\r\nLamar had not been an active, practising lawyer.\r\n\r\nI happened to be at the White House one day, and Mr. Cleveland said\r\nto me:  \"I wish you would take up Lamar's nomination and dispose\r\nof it.  I am between hay and grass with reference to the Interior\r\nDepartment.  Nothing is being done there; I ought to have some one\r\non duty, and I can not do anything until you dispose of Lamar.\"\r\n\r\nHe had, I suppose, spoken to other Senators along the same line.\r\nThe nomination was taken up soon after, and he was confirmed.  I\r\nvoted against his confirmation in the Senate; not because I had\r\nanything against him personally, or because he was a Southern\r\nDemocrat, but I understood that he had not practised law at all,\r\nand I did not believe that sort of man should be appointed to fill\r\nso high and responsible a position.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I got along very well with President Cleveland,\r\nconsidering the fact that he was a Democrat and I a Republican.\r\nI visited the White House frequently, and he generally granted\r\nanything that I asked for.\r\n\r\nHe was keenly interested in the passage of the first Interstate\r\nCommerce Act.  It became a law under his administration, and although\r\nthe Democrats supported it, it succeeded mainly through the influence\r\nof Republican Senators and a Republican Senate.  When the bill went\r\nto the President, and while he had it under consideration, he sent\r\nfor me to explain one or two sections which he did not understand.\r\nI called one night about nine o'clock and found him surrounded by\r\na multitude of papers, hard at work reading the bill.  I explained\r\nthe sections concerning which he was in doubt as best I could, and\r\nhe said:  \"I will approve the bill.\"\r\n\r\nI immediately took advantage of the occasion to say:  \"Now, Mr.\r\nPresident, I might just as well take this opportunity to talk with\r\nyou with reference to the appointment of a Commission.  A Republican\r\nSenate has passed this bill, and as I had charge of it in the\r\nSenate, I think you ought to permit me to recommend the appointment\r\nof one commissioner.\"  He agreed to this, asking me to present the\r\nname of some Republican whom I desired appointed.\r\n\r\nAfterward there were complications with the members of his own\r\nparty in Congress, and he sent for me to tell me that Colonel\r\nMorrison, of Illinois, had been recommended by the whole \"Free\r\nTrade Party,\" as he called it, and that he did not see how he was\r\ngoing to avoid appointing him.  I suggested that he give Morrison\r\nsomething else.  He undertook to do so; but Morrison, true to his\r\nindependent nature, declined to accept anything else, declaring\r\nthat he would like to have the office of commissioner, and if he\r\ncould not have that he would accept nothing.\r\n\r\nThe President sent for me again, and told me he could not satisfy\r\nMorrison, and he did not know how he was going to solve the\r\ncomplication.  I said, in effect, that I had been a Governor of a\r\nState and I knew sometimes that an executive officer had to do\r\nthings he did not expect to do, and did not desire to do, but that\r\nhe had to yield to party pressure.  I ceased insisting upon an\r\nappointment, and allowed Morrison to be named.  At the same time\r\nI was a little provoked and out of patience and I added:  \"Colonel\r\nMorrison knows nothing about the subject whatever.  If you are\r\ngoing to appoint broken-down politicians who have been defeated at\r\nhome, as a sort of salve for the sores caused by their defeat, we\r\nmight as well repeal the law.\"\r\n\r\nI inquired of him:  \"Who else are you going to appoint on that\r\nCommission?\"  I had previously recommended Judge Cooley.\r\n\r\n\"I will appoint Cooley,\" promised the President.\r\n\r\n\"Will Cooley take it?\" I asked; to which he replied, \"I will offer\r\nany place on the Commission he desires, and will telegraph him at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nI expressed my satisfaction with this arrangement.  He did telegraph\r\nJudge Cooley, who accepted, and was the first and most distinguished\r\nchairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Forty-ninth Congress assembled on December 7, 1885, with Thomas\r\nA. Hendricks, Vice-President, presiding in the Senate, John Sherman\r\nhaving been elected President _pro tempore_.  The Senate was still\r\nin the control of the Republicans by a majority of five.  The\r\nDemocrats had a majority of something like forty in the House, and\r\nelected John G. Carlisle Speaker.  This is practically the same\r\nsituation that had prevailed during the previous Congress, except\r\nthis time the Democrats, in addition to a majority, had the Chief\r\nExecutive as well.  But they were just as powerless to enact\r\nlegislation as they had been before.\r\n\r\nSenators Evarts, of New York; Spooner, of Wisconsin; Teller, of\r\nColorado; Stanford, of California; Gray, of Delaware; Brown, of\r\nGeorgia; Blackburn, of Kentucky; and Walthall, of Mississippi, were\r\na few of the prominent men who entered the Senate at the beginning\r\nof the Cleveland Administration.\r\n\r\nSenator Evarts was recognized for many years as the leader of the\r\nAmerican Bar.  He was not only a profound lawyer, but one of the\r\ngreatest public speakers of the day.  I remember him as a good\r\nnatured, agreeable man, who was pre-eminently capable of filling\r\nthe highest places in public life.  He was Attorney-General under\r\nPresident Johnson, Secretary of State under President Hayes, and\r\ncounsel representing the United States before many great international\r\ntribunals.  He defended President Johnson in his impeachment\r\nproceedings, and I remember yet his lofty eloquence on that memorable\r\noccasion.  He did not accomplish much as a Senator, but he did take\r\nan active part where a legal or constitutional question came before\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nIllustrating how great lawyers are as apt to be wrong on a legal\r\nquestion as the lesser legal lights, Senator Evarts expressed the\r\nopinion that Congress did not possess the constitutional power to\r\npass the Act of 1887 to regulate commerce.  He contended in the\r\ndebate that the act was a restriction and not a regulation of\r\ncommerce, and consequently was beyond the power of Congress.  The\r\nSupreme Court of the United States very soon afterwards sustained\r\nthe constitutionality of the act.\r\n\r\nBefore his term expired he became partially blind, and the story\r\nis told by the late Senator Hoar that Senator Evarts and he had\r\ndelivered speeches in the Senate on some great legal, constitutional\r\nquestion, Senator Hoar on one side, Senator Evarts on the other.\r\nThe latter asked Senator Hoar to look over the proof of his speech\r\nand correct it, and in reading over the proof Senator Hoar told me\r\nthat he became convinced that his position was wrong and that Evarts\r\nwas right.\r\n\r\nI do not know of a Democrat with whom I have served in the Senate\r\nfor whom I have greater respect than George Gray, of Delaware.  We\r\nbecame quite intimate and were paired all during his service.  He\r\nwas one of the few Senators that every Senator on both sides believed\r\nin and was willing to trust.  Indeed, our country would not suffer\r\nif he were elected President of the United States.  He has held\r\nmany important positions,--Senator, member of the Paris Peace\r\nCommission, United States Circuit Judge, member of many arbitration\r\ncommissions,--in all of which he acquitted himself with great honor.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Senator Henry M. Teller, of Colorado, returned to the\r\nSenate at the beginning of this Congress.  He had previously served\r\nin the Senate, and resigned to accept a Cabinet position under\r\nPresident Arthur.  Senator Teller has had a long and honorable\r\npublic career.  He was elected to the Senate several times as a\r\nRepublican, and appointed to the office of Secretary of the Interior\r\nas a Republican.  He continued this affiliation until the silver\r\nagitation, in 1896, when he regarded himself as being justified in\r\nleaving the party, and was twice elected afterward to the Senate\r\nby the Legislature of his State, and during this last term I believe\r\nhe became a pretty strong Democrat; yet he never allowed partisanship\r\nto enter into his action on legislation, excepting where a party\r\nissue was involved, when he would vote with his party.\r\n\r\nI served with him on the Appropriation Committee and other committees\r\nof the Senate, and regarded him as one of the best Senators for\r\ncommittee service with whom I was ever associated.  The friendly\r\nrelations between Senator Teller and myself have been very close\r\nand intimate since I first knew him, and I am glad to say that the\r\nfact that he left the Republican party has not disturbed them in\r\nthe least.\r\n\r\nMr. Teller's withdrawal from the Republican party after its\r\ndeclaration for the Gold Standard in the St. Louis Convention of\r\n1896 was due to his abiding conviction in support of the principles\r\nof bimetallism.  He had been a member of the party almost since\r\nits organization, and up to '96, although independent upon many\r\npoints at issue, had been regarded as one of the party's stanchest\r\nand most reliable adherents.  The severance of the ties of a lifetime\r\ncould not be made without producing a visible effect upon a man of\r\nMr. Teller's fine sensibilities, but I was pleased to observe that\r\nhe did not allow the incident to change his personal relations.\r\nHe continued as a member of the Senate for twelve or thirteen years\r\nafter he left the Republican party, and I am sure that he did not\r\nlose the respect or personal regard of a single Republican member\r\nof the body.  Personally, I regarded him just as warmly as a Democrat\r\nas I had esteemed him as a Republican, and I am sure that my attitude\r\ntoward him was reflected by his attitude toward myself.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado Senator's nature is such that he cannot dissemble,\r\nand when his conviction led him to condemn the Republican party\r\nbecause of its position on the money question, he could not find\r\nit in his conscience to remain in that party.  Time has shown that\r\nhe was mistaken as to the results that might follow the adoption\r\nof the gold standard, but it has not served to alter the character\r\nof the man.  He will stand for what he believes to be right, whatever\r\nthe consequences to himself.  As a legislator, he was faithful in\r\nhis work in committee and in the Senate.  No man was more constant\r\nin his attendance, and none gave more conscientious attention to\r\nthe problems of legislation.  An unusually strong lawyer and a man\r\ngiven to studious research, he never failed to strengthen any cause\r\nwhich he espoused nor to throw light upon any subject which came\r\nwithin his range of vision.  With the exception of three years\r\nspent as Secretary of the Interior he was a member of the Senate\r\nfrom 1876, the year of Colorado's admission to the Union, until\r\n1909, during which time he had nine different colleagues from his\r\nown State.\r\n\r\nMr. Teller was a resident of Illinois before he removed to Colorado\r\nin 1861, and was one of the earliest supporters of Mr. Lincoln.\r\nHis father and mother remained in Illinois as long as they lived,\r\nand Senator Teller always has retained interests in that State.\r\nI think he still has relatives residing in Whiteside County.\r\n\r\nWilliam Eaton Chandler, of New Hampshire, was one of the first\r\ngovernment officials with whom I became acquainted when I came to\r\nWashington, in 1865, as a member of the House of Representatives.\r\nHe was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.  We became quite intimate\r\nand our relations ever since have been the most cordial and\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\nSenator Chandler is a man of wonderfully acute intellect.  For many\r\nyears he served his people in the Legislature of New Hampshire and\r\nwas a member of the Senate of the United States for several terms.\r\nAfter he retired from the Senate in 1901, President McKinley\r\nappointed him a member of the Spanish Claims Commission.  In the\r\ndischarge of the duties of that office he manifested the same high\r\nconception of his trust as in every position he occupied, either\r\nelective or appointive, and I think he saved to the government of\r\nthe United States many millions of dollars in the adjudication of\r\nclaims growing out of the Spanish-American War.\r\n\r\nWhile Senator Chandler is very combative in his attitude toward\r\nothers, yet his innate sincerity draws one close to him after\r\nbecoming acquainted with him.  A little incident which will illustrate\r\nthis trait, occurred in the Senate of the United States some years\r\nago.  Mr. Chandler was induced to believe that the late Senator\r\nProctor, of Vermont, did not like him very much.  So Chandler went\r\nup to Proctor, and said:  \"Proctor, don't you like me?\"  Proctor\r\nin his coarse gruff voice replied:  \"I have acquired a liking for\r\nyou.\"  He established the point without circumlocution or diplomacy.\r\n\r\nAs Chairman of the Committee on Interstate Commerce of the Senate,\r\nI objected to the appointment of Chandler as a member of that\r\ncommittee.  I did not believe he would be very attentive.  It turned\r\nout that I was mistaken and I often wished that he would stay away\r\nfrom the meetings, because he was always stirring up some new\r\nquestion that involved the time of the committee.  He was inspired,\r\nhowever, by the highest motive, recognizing as he did that the\r\ncontrol of the railroads of the country was a matter of supreme\r\nimportance to the people of the United States.  He rendered valuable\r\nservice on the committee in the enactment of legislation on this\r\nimportant subject.\r\n\r\nSenator Leland Stanford, of California, was a man of large wealth,\r\nand became famous on account of his having built the Central Pacific\r\nRailroad.  He was a man of business experience and made a valuable\r\nSenator.  He died as a member of the Senate, and his wife founded\r\nLeland Stanford Jr. University.\r\n\r\nSenator Stanford's colleague, Senator Hearst, who entered the Senate\r\ntwo years after Senator Stanford, was also a man of very large\r\nwealth and possessor of a interesting character.  Concerning him\r\nmany amusing stories are told.  He gave an elaborate dinner one\r\nevening, which I attended.  There were twenty-five of us present\r\nwith our wives, and after dinner was over the men went down to the\r\nsmoking-room.  Senator Hearst had thought out a little speech to\r\nmake to us, in which he said:  \"I do now know much about books; I\r\nhave not read very much; but I have travelled a good deal and\r\nobserved men and things, and I have made up my mind after all my\r\nexperience that the members of the Senate are the survival of the\r\nfittest.\"  Senator Hearst died while serving as a member of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nMatthew Stanley Quay was a conspicuous figure in our political\r\nhistory.  He had been a soldier in the Civil War and afterwards\r\noccupied many positions of importance in the civil affairs in his\r\nState.  Few men in American political life have had so constant a\r\nstruggle as did Senator Quay to retain his ascendancy in Republican\r\npolitics in Pennsylvania.  Quay in Pennsylvania, and T. C. Platt\r\nin New York, were regarded as two of the greatest political bosses\r\nin the country.  In national convention after national convention\r\nthey exercised a paramount influence over the nomination of\r\nPresidents, and the two usually worked together.  Their political\r\nmethods were about the same.  Quay was the bigger man of the two;\r\nbut it must be said, in justice to both of them, that the word of\r\neither was as good as his bond.  Senator Quay was returned to the\r\nSenate after a desperate struggle.  I was glad to see him return,\r\nbut saddened to see that he was sorely afflicted with a disease\r\nthat finally proved fatal.  Senator Quay and Senator Platt have\r\nboth passed away.  They were the two last survivors of the old\r\ncoterie of politicians who so long dominated Republican national\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the Cleveland Administration, a vacancy occurred\r\nin the office of Chief Justice of the United States, to fill which\r\nPresident Cleveland appointed the Hon. Melville W. Fuller, of\r\nIllinois.  I had something to do with this appointment.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Fuller has only recently passed away, after serving\r\nas Chief Justice of the United States for a longer period than any\r\nof his predecessors in that high office, with the two exceptions\r\nof Marshall and Taney.  I knew Melville W. Fuller for many years\r\nbefore he became Chief Justice.  Away back in war times, I knew\r\nhim as a member of the Illinois Legislature and as a member of the\r\nConstitutional Convention, and subsequently as one of the leading\r\nlawyers of the Chicago Bar.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland was in a considerable quandary over the\r\nappointment of a Chief Justice.  He wanted to bestow the seat upon\r\nan able lawyer, and he wanted a Democrat, but as the Senate was in\r\ncontrol of the Republicans he wanted to make sure to name some one\r\nwhom the Senate would confirm.  He at first seriously considered\r\nJudge Phelps, of Vermont, a cultivated and able man, who had been\r\nMinister to England, but for some reason or other--why I never knew\r\n--he finally rejected Phelps as an available candidate and determined\r\nupon a Western man as Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nPrior to this, however, he had considered the appointment of Justice\r\nScholfield, of our own State, who was then a member of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Illinois, which never had an abler or better lawyer as a\r\nmember of its personnel.  He would have been given the honor had\r\nhe signified a willingness to accept; but when he was approached\r\nby Representative Townsend, at the suggestion of President Cleveland,\r\nafter considering the matter, he demurred, asserting that although\r\nhe would enjoy the distinction of being Chief Justice of the United\r\nStates, he did not think that life in Washington, and especially\r\nthe social side of the life which the Chief Justice of the United\r\nStates naturally is expected to lead, would suit either him or his\r\nfamily.  He had a family of growing children, who had been raised\r\nin the country, and they would naturally have to accompany him to\r\nWashington.  He feared that Washington life would ruin them, so he\r\nfinally declined the appointment.\r\n\r\nJudge Fuller had been a close friend of President Cleveland, had\r\nbeen a member of the national convention that nominated him, was\r\nrecognized as one of the leading Democrats of Illinois, and had\r\nbeen consulted by Mr. Cleveland in the distribution of the patronage\r\nin that State; so naturally Judge Fuller was considered in connection\r\nwith the office.  It was not surprising, considering that the Senate\r\nwas then in the control of the Republicans, that he would want to\r\nenlist my aid in securing his confirmation.\r\n\r\nI called on Mr. Cleveland about nine o'clock one morning in regard\r\nto some personal matter.  He at once sent out word for me to come\r\nin, that he wanted to see me.  I apologized for appearing at so\r\nearly an hour, whereupon he said that he was very glad that I had\r\ncome because he desired to have a talk with me.  Then he inquired\r\nwhom I considered the best lawyer, belonging to his party, in\r\nIllinois, who would make a good Chief Justice.  He at once himself\r\nmentioned Judge Fuller.  I told him that Judge Gowdy was probably\r\nthe ablest Democratic lawyer in Illinois, but that he was a railroad\r\nattorney, and it would probably not be a good thing to appoint him.\r\nHe next questioned me particularly about Fuller.  I told him that\r\nI knew Fuller very well indeed; that if I were called upon to name\r\nfive of the best lawyers of Illinois belonging to his party, I\r\nwould name Fuller among the five; that he was not only a good\r\nlawyer, but a scholarly man, a gentleman who would grace the\r\nposition.  He at once intimated that he would send his name to the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nI said to him:  \"Mr. President, the selection of a Chief Justice\r\nis one of the greatest duties you have to perform.  _You_ can make\r\na mistake; we can raise the devil in Congress; but with a capable\r\nSupreme Court standing steady and firm, doing its full duty, the\r\ncountry is safe.\"\r\n\r\nHe agreed with me; and very soon thereafter Melville W. Fuller was\r\nnominated as Chief Justice of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut this was only the prelude to the real struggle.  The nomination\r\nwas referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, of which Senator\r\nEdmunds, of Vermont, was chairman.  The latter was very much out\r\nof humor with the President, because he had fully expected that\r\nJudge Phelps, of his own State, was to receive the honor, and he\r\ndid not take it kindly that the appointment should go to Illinois.\r\nHe had told me himself, in confidence, that he had every assurance\r\nthat Judge Phelps was to be nominated.\r\n\r\nThe result was the Senator Edmunds held the nomination, without\r\nany action, in the Judiciary Committee for some three months, as\r\nI now recollect.  Finally there began to be more or less scandal\r\nhinted at and suggestions of something wrong, and so forth; which\r\nI considered so entirely uncalled for and unfair to Judge Fuller\r\nthat I appeared before the Judiciary Committee of the Senate and\r\nasked that the nomination be reported favorably if possible,\r\nunfavorably if the committee so determined; and if the committee\r\nwas not disposed to report the nomination either favorably or\r\nunfavorably that they report the nomination to the Senate without\r\nrecommendation, so that the Senate itself might have an opportunity\r\nto act upon it.  The latter action was taken, and the nomination\r\nwas laid naked before the Senate.  The matter was considered in\r\nexecutive session.  Senator Edmunds at once took the floor and\r\nattacked Judge Fuller most viciously as having sympathized with\r\nthe Rebellion, together with much to the same effect.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime some one had sent me a printed copy of a speech\r\nwhich Judge Phelps had delivered during the war, attacking Mr.\r\nLincoln in the most outrageous and undignified fashion.  When I\r\nread that speech I then and there determined that Judge Phelps\r\nwould never be confirmed as Chief Justice, even though the President\r\nmight send his nomination to the Senate.  I put the speech in my\r\ndesk, determining that if I ever had a good chance I would read it\r\nin the Senate, at the same time pointing out that the only objection\r\nwhich Senator Edmunds opposed to Judge Fuller was his pique because\r\nPhelps had not received the appointment.  Edmunds' attack on Judge\r\nFuller gave me the opportunity, and I read the speech of Judge\r\nPhelps to the Senate, much to the chagrin and mortification of\r\nSenator Edmunds.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats in the Senate enjoyed the controversy between Senator\r\nEdmunds and myself; Senator Voorhees was particularly amused,\r\nlaughing heartily all through it.  Naturally, it appeared to them\r\na very funny performance, two Republicans quarreling over the\r\nconfirmation of a Democrat.  They sat silent, however, and took no\r\npart at all in the debate, leaving us Republicans to settle it\r\namong ourselves.  The vote was taken and Judge Fuller was confirmed\r\nby a substantial majority.\r\n\r\nJudge Fuller was very grateful to me for what I had done in behalf\r\nof his confirmation, and afterwards he wrote me a letter of thanks:\r\n\r\n  \"Chicago, _July 21, 1888_.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Senator:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot refrain from expressing to you my intense appreciation\r\nat the vigorous way in which you secured my confirmation.  I use\r\nthe word 'vigorous' because, though it was more than that, that\r\nwas the quality that struck me most forcibly when I saw the newspapers\r\nthis morning.  When we meet, as I hope we will soon, I would very\r\nmuch like to talk this matter over with you.  I hope you will never\r\nhave cause to regret your action.  I can't tell you how pleased I\r\nam that Maine and Illinois, both so dear to me, stood by me.  But\r\nbecause I love them, I do not love my country any the less, as you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\"And so I am to be called 'Judge' after all!  This is between\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n  \"Faithfully yours,\r\n  \"M. W. Fuller.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Frye voted in favor of Judge Fuller's confirmation.  He\r\ndid this partly, I believe, because Fuller was a Maine man and a\r\nclassmate of his at Bowdoin College, he previously having entertained\r\nsome doubts, as he told me afterwards, whether Fuller was really\r\nqualified to be Chief Justice of the United States.  Very soon\r\nafter his appointment, the Chief Justice was invited to deliver an\r\naddress before the Joint Session of the two Houses of Congress.\r\nI think it was on the occasion of the one-hundredth anniversary of\r\nthe inauguration of the first President of the United States.\r\nSenator Frye and I walked together over to the hall of the House\r\nwhere the joint session assembled, and he said as we went along:\r\n\"I will determine to-day, after I hear Fuller deliver his address,\r\nwhether I did right or wrong in voting for his confirmation as\r\nChief Justice.\"  Judge Fuller delivered a most beautiful speech,\r\nwhich would have done credit to any man, no matter how high a\r\nposition he occupied in this or any other country; and as we returned\r\ntogether to our own chamber, Senator Frye remarked:  \"Cullom, it\r\nis all right.  I am satisfied now that I did right in voting in\r\nfavor of the confirmation of Fuller's nomination.\"\r\n\r\nMelville W. Fuller filled the position of Chief Justice of the\r\nUnited States with great credit and dignity.  He wrote, during his\r\nlong term of service, many very able opinions.  I did not agree\r\nwith his conclusions in the Income Tax case; but I think every\r\nlawyer will conceded that this opinion was about as able a presentation\r\nof that side of the case as could be made.  He was a most conservative\r\nand safe man for the high position which he occupied.  Of necessity\r\nthe Chief Justice of the United States must be an executive officer\r\nas well as an able lawyer and judge.  There was no better executive\r\nofficer than Chief Justice Fuller.  Justice Miller told me on one\r\noccasion that Fuller was the best presiding judge that the Supreme\r\nCourt had had within his time; and in addition he was a most lovable,\r\ncongenial man.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw Judge Fuller he was particularly agreeable.\r\nI called to invite him to deliver an address at a great banquet to\r\nbe held in Springfield on Lincoln's birthday in February, 1909.\r\nI have had a great deal of experience in trying to prevail upon\r\nprominent men to deliver addresses in Illinois, and I know how they\r\nalways hesitate, and hem and haw, then, if they do accept, destroy\r\nall feelings of gratitude and appreciation by the ungracious manner\r\nin which they do so.  It was certainly a pleasant surprise and a\r\ncontrast to custom to hear Judge Fuller's reply when I extended\r\nthe invitation to him.  \"Why, certainly,\" he responded promptly;\r\n\"I will be delighted to accept.  I have been wanting to visit\r\nSpringfield for twenty years, and I am glad to receive the\r\ninvitation.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply was quite characteristic of Chief Justice Fuller.  I\r\ncould not imagine him saying an unkind word to any one.  His\r\ndisposition was to treat his colleagues on the Bench, the members\r\nof the Bar who appeared before him, and every one with whom he came\r\nin contact, with the greatest kindness and consideration.  He passed\r\naway, quietly and peacefully, as he would have wished, honored and\r\nrespected by the Bench and Bar of the Nation, and by the people of\r\nhis home State, who took pride in the fact that Illinois had\r\nfurnished to the United States a Chief Justice for so long a period.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Fuller was succeeded by Hon. Edward D. White, of\r\nLouisiana, with whom I served for three years in the Senate of the\r\nUnited States.  Justice White was an able Senator, and in the\r\ndisposition of some of the most important cases which have come\r\nbefore the Supreme Court in recent years affecting corporations he\r\nhas shown great ability and is a worthy successor of his predecessors\r\nin that high office.\r\n\r\nAside from the act to regulate commerce, an act providing for\r\nthe Presidential succession, and an act in reference to polygamy,\r\nthere was very little, if any, important legislation during the\r\nfirst Cleveland Administration.\r\n\r\nIt was a very quiet administration.  The country clearly comprehended\r\nthat the Senate stood in the way of any Democratic doctrine being\r\nenacted into law, and generally, as I remember it now, the country\r\nwas fairly prosperous.  This condition continued until President\r\nCleveland's famous Free Trade message of December 5, 1887, came as\r\na startling blow to the business and manufacturing interests of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nWhy he should have sent such a message to Congress when his\r\nadministration was about to come to a close, and when he knew\r\nperfectly well that no tariff legislation could be enacted with a\r\nDemocratic House and a Republican Senate, I do not know.  He for\r\nthe first time stepped out boldly and asserted his Free Trade\r\ndoctrine, and made the issue squarely on tariff for protection as\r\nagainst Free Trade, or tariff for revenue.  This message naturally\r\nprecipitated a tariff discussion in both House and Senate, and the\r\nDemocratic majority of the House considered it incumbent on them\r\nto make some attempt to carry out the President's policy.  As a\r\nresult the so-called Mills Bill was reported, upon which debates\r\ncontinued for many months.  One member in closing this discussion\r\nvery aptly said:\r\n\r\n\"This debate will perhaps be known as the most remarkable that has\r\never occurred in our parliamentary history.  It has awakened an\r\ninterest not only throughout the length and breadth of our own\r\ncountry, but throughout the civilized world, and henceforth, as\r\nlong as our government shall endure, it will be known as 'the great\r\ntariff debate of 1888.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this debate in the House that both Mr. Reed and Mr.\r\nMcKinley so distinguished themselves as the great advocates of\r\nProtection.  Mr. Reed was then the floor leader of the minority.\r\nHe made a magnificent speech against Free Trade in which he used\r\nmany familiar allegories, one of which I have often used myself in\r\ncampaign speeches.  It is substantially as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Once there was a dog.  He was a nice little dog--nothing the matter\r\nwith him, except a few foolish Free Trade ideas in his head.  He\r\nwas trotting along, happy as the day, for he had in his mouth a\r\nnice shoulder of succulent mutton.  By and by he came to a stream\r\nbridged by a plank.  He trotted along, and looking over the side\r\nof the plank, he saw the markets of the world, and dived for them.\r\nA minute afterwards he was crawling up the bank the wettest, the\r\nsickest, the nastiest, the most muttonless dog that ever swam\r\nashore.\"\r\n\r\nThomas B. Reed was one whom I unquestionably would term a great\r\nman.  He was conspicuous among the most brilliant presiding officers\r\nthat ever occupied the chair of the Speaker.  He ruled the House\r\nwith a rod of iron, thus earning for himself the nickname of \"Czar.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this was more or less warranted.  He was the first Speaker to\r\ninaugurate the new rules.  He found a demoralized House in which\r\nit was difficult to enact legislation, and in which the right of\r\nthe majority to rule was questioned and hampered.  He turned the\r\nLower House into an orderly legislative body in which legislation\r\nwas enacted expeditiously by the majority.  He had more perfect\r\ncontrol over the House than any former Speaker, and his authority\r\nremained unquestioned until he retired.  He ruled alone; after he\r\nbecame Speaker he had no favorites; he had no little coterie of\r\nmen around him to excite the jealousy of the members of the House,\r\nand it has even been said that so careful was he in this respect\r\nthat he would scarcely venture to walk in public with a member of\r\nthe House.  He was a powerful man intellectually and physically,\r\nand he looked the giant he was among the members of the House.  He\r\nwanted to be President; and it seems rather a queer coincidence\r\nthat his election as Speaker paved the way for his rival, Mr.\r\nMcKinley, as by his acceptance of the chair Mr. McKinley became\r\nthe leader of the majority, chairman of the Committee on Ways and\r\nMeans, the author of the McKinley Bill, which finally resulted in\r\nits author's defeat for Congress, but in his election as President\r\nof the United States in 1896.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Mills Bill.  It passed the House by a substantial\r\nmajority and came to the Senate, where a substitute was prepared\r\nby the Finance Committee and reported by Senator Allison early in\r\nOctober.  I remember the discussion on it in the Senate very well.\r\nWe all thought it incumbent upon us to make speeches for home\r\nconsumption, for campaign use, showing the iniquities of the Mills\r\nBill, and of the Democratic tariff generally, although we knew it\r\nwas impossible for either bill to become law.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional session continued until about the middle of\r\nOctober with nothing done in the way of practical legislation.\r\n\r\nThis was the situation when the National Republican Convention\r\nassembled in 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nCLEVELAND'S DEFEAT AND HARRISON'S FIRST TERM\r\n1888 to 1891\r\n\r\nAt the time the delegates gathered, Cleveland's Free Trade message\r\nof 1887 was before the country, interest in it having been augmented\r\nand enlivened by the passage of the Mills Bill and the renowned\r\ntariff debate of that year.  The issue was clear.  It was Protective\r\nTariff _versus_ Free Trade.  After a rather strenuous contest in\r\nthe convention in which nineteen candidates were voted for, for\r\nthe nomination for President, including the leading candidates,\r\nJohn Sherman, of Ohio, Walter Q. Gresham, of Indiana, Harrison, of\r\nIndiana, and Allison, of Iowa, Benjamin Harrison finally was chosen\r\non the eighth ballot.\r\n\r\nIn his autobiography Senator Hoar affirms that William B. Allison\r\ncame nearer being the nominee of the party than any other man in\r\nits history who was a candidate and failed to secure the endorsement.\r\nAccording to Senator Hoar, it was the opposition of Senator Depew,\r\nangered by the agrarian hostility toward himself, that prevented\r\nSenator Allison's nomination.  I have no personal knowledge that\r\nmight refute this statement, but I have been disposed to question\r\nits correctness.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland was of course renominated.  The campaign came\r\non, and he was defeated squarely on the Tariff issue, and the\r\nRepublicans were again in the ascendancy in both branches of the\r\nGovernment, the Senate being composed of forty-seven Republicans\r\nand thirty-seven Democrats, while the House contained one hundred\r\nand seventy Republicans and one hundred and sixty Democrats, Mr.\r\nReed being elected Speaker.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison was inaugurated with a great civic and military\r\ndisplay, equalling, if not surpassing, that of any other President.\r\nThere was great rejoicing among Republicans on account of the return\r\nof the party to power.  The Cabinet was duly appointed, with Mr.\r\nBlaine, the foremost Republican and statesman of his day, as\r\nSecretary of State--which, by the way, was an unfortunate appointment\r\nboth for Mr. Harrison and Mr. Blaine.  There was the usual scramble\r\nfor offices, the usual changes in the foreign service, in the\r\nexecutive departments in Washington and in the federal offices\r\ngenerally throughout the country.  Robert T. Lincoln, of whom I\r\nhave already written, was appointed Minister to the Court of St.\r\nJames.\r\n\r\nColonel Clark E. Carr, of Illinois, was appointed Minister to\r\nDenmark, and made a splendid record in that position.  He was very\r\npopular with the royal family.  I had the pleasure of visiting\r\nCopenhagen while he was Minister there, and was the guest of Colonel\r\nand Mrs. Carr, who entertained me very handsomely.  They gave a\r\ndinner in my honor, which was attended by the whole diplomatic\r\ncorps at Copenhagen.  The Colonel also arranged for a private\r\naudience with the King, and he presented me to him, as he also did\r\nmy friend, Colonel Bluford Wilson, who accompanied me on my visit\r\nto Copenhagen.  Altogether, through the courtesy of Colonel Carr,\r\nI enjoyed my stay in Copenhagen exceedingly.\r\n\r\nHe retired from office after Mr. Cleveland was elected, and has\r\nsince achieved distinction as an author.  He has written several\r\nvery interesting books which have had a wide circulation.  For many\r\nyears Colonel Carr has taken an active part in our State and National\r\ncampaigns.  He is a forceful speaker, so naturally his services\r\nhave been in constant requisition by the State and National Republican\r\nCommittees.  He has rendered very valuable service to the Republican\r\nparty both in the State and in the Nation.\r\n\r\nI had known President Harrison for many years.  He represented a\r\nneighboring State in the Senate, of which body he was a leader when\r\nI entered it in 1883.  I probably knew him as well as any of my\r\nRepublican colleagues; but his was a very cold, distant temperament,\r\neven in the Senate, hardly capable of forming a very close friendship\r\nfor any one, and he had no particular friends.\r\n\r\nIn justice to Mr. Harrison, however, it must be said that he was\r\na masterly lawyer, and his appointments generally were first-class.\r\nEspecially was he fortunate in his selection of Federal judges.\r\nHe selected them himself, and would tolerate no interference from\r\nany one.  He did select the very best men he could find.  For\r\ninstance, he appointed such men as Justice Brewer, of Kansas;\r\nJustice Brown, of Michigan; Judge Woods, of Indiana; and it was\r\nHarrison who appointed President Taft as a Federal Judge.  He was\r\nan exceptionally able President, and gave the country an excellent\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time he was probably the most unsatisfactory\r\nPresident we ever had in the White House to those who must necessarily\r\ncome into personal contact with him.  He was quite a public speaker,\r\nand the story has often been told of him that if he should address\r\nten thousand men from a public platform, he would make every one\r\nhis friend; but that if he should meet each of those ten thousand\r\nmen personally, each man would go away his enemy.  He lacked the\r\nfaculty of treating people in a manner to retain their friendship.\r\nEven Senators and Representatives calling on official business he\r\nwould treat with scant courtesy.  He scarcely ever invited any one\r\nto have a chair.\r\n\r\nSenator Platt, of Connecticut, asked me one day if I was going to\r\nthe White House to dine that evening, stating that he had an\r\ninvitation.  I told him no, that I had not yet been invited, that\r\nI had never yet during the Harrison administration even been invited\r\nto take a seat in the White House.  Some one overheard the remark\r\nand it was published in the newspapers.  I visited the White House\r\nshortly afterwards, and I assume that Harrison had seen it because\r\nas soon as he saw me, without a smile on his face or a gleam in\r\nhis eye, he hastened to get me a chair, inviting me to be seated.\r\nI declined to sit down, explaining that I was in a hurry, and closed\r\nthe business I had come for, and left.  Afterwards he invited me\r\nto dinner and treated me with marked consideration.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes wondered whether President Harrison's apparent\r\ncoldness may not be ascribed to an absorption in his duties that\r\nmade him unintentionally neglectful of the little amenities of\r\npolite usage, they never even having occurred to him.  Despite his\r\ncold exterior and frigid manner, it may have been he was sympathetic\r\nat heart.  When the Tracey homestead was destroyed by fire, which\r\nresulted in the death of several persons, including the daughter,\r\nand finally resulted in the death of Mrs. Tracey, President Harrison\r\ntook the family into the White House and did everything a man could\r\ndo to relieve their sufferings.\r\n\r\nI suppose he treated me about as well in the way of patronage as\r\nhe did any other Senator; but whenever he did anything for me it\r\nwas done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather\r\nthan please.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the letters which I received from President Harrison,\r\nI find one which would show that he placed considerable confidence\r\nin my recommendations.\r\n\r\n  \"Executive Mansion,\r\n  \"Washington, _Oct. 24, 1889_.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. Shelby M. Cullom,\r\n  \"Springfield, Ills.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Senator:--\r\n\r\n\"I want to say a few words further to you about the Chicago\r\nappointments.  There has been for some months a good deal of\r\ncomplaint that changes were not made.\r\n\r\n\"I find that the Collector of Customs and the Collector of Internal\r\nRevenue were appointed, the one Sept. 14, and the other Sept. 10,\r\n1885, and that the first was confirmed May 17, 1886; and the last,\r\nApril 17, 1886.  I do not have before me the record as to the\r\nappointment of the United States District Attorney.  The Assistant\r\nTreasurer was appointed Sept. 29, 1885, and confirmed May 6, 1886.\r\nIf there had been no question raised as to the qualifications and\r\nfitness of the persons recommended, it is quite possible that I\r\nwould have taken some steps in the matter during this month; but\r\nthe fact is, as you have told me, that at least one, and possibly\r\ntwo, of the persons suggested were not of a high order of fitness,\r\nto say the least, and some members of your Congressional delegation\r\ninterested have given me the same impression, while from outside\r\nsources there have been a good many things said to the prejudice\r\nof persons named for appointment.  I am informed that Senator\r\nFarwell desires to leave the case just where his recommendations\r\nhave placed it, feeling that he cannot change to any one else.  I\r\nwrite to know whether you also feel in that way, or whether you\r\ndesire to make any further suggestions about the matter.  I have\r\nno other purpose in connection with these appointments than to find\r\nmen, the mention of whose names will commend them to the great\r\nbusiness community they are to serve.  No one of those named, so\r\nfar as I know, is suggestive of any personal claim upon me, and I\r\nhave no personal ends to serve.  You agreed with me, I think, when\r\nwe conversed, that the appointees there should be men of as high\r\ncharacter for integrity and intelligence, etc., as those they would\r\nsupersede.\r\n\r\n\"In the case of the Assistant Treasurer I found on examining the\r\npapers yesterday, very full and strong papers for Mr. Nichols, whom\r\nI do not know.  He is supported, apparently, by the bankers and\r\nmany leading merchants of Chicago, and their letters give in detail\r\nhis business character and experience.  Of the gentleman recommended\r\nby you and Senator Farwell, there is absolutely nothing said in\r\nthe papers, so that Mr. Windom or I could have any information as\r\nto whether his business experience had been such as to fit him for\r\nthis place.  Now, I am sure that on reflection you will agree that\r\nwe ought to have full information, and that it should be upon\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\"I told Mr. Taylor, in conversation, day before yesterday, that I\r\ncould not appoint Mr. Babcock marshal, as I told you when you were\r\nhere; and I remember that you said you had yourself refused to\r\nrecommend him.  If things have assumed that shape that you are of\r\nthe opinion that it must be left to me as it stands, then I will\r\ndo the best I can with it.  I do not conceal the fact that after\r\nthe essential of fitness is secured that I have a desire to please\r\nour party friends in these selections.  But I cannot escape the\r\nresponsibility for the appointments, and must therefore insist upon\r\nfull information about the persons presented, and upon my ultimate\r\nright, in all kindness to everybody, to decide upon what must be\r\ndone.  It would be very gratifying to me if the responsibility were\r\nplaced upon some one else.\r\n\r\n\"Please let me have any suggestions you may care to make.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"Benj. Harrison.\r\n\r\n\"P. S.  Responding to your telegram asking delay till Nov. 5, I\r\nwould say that I have no disposition to hurry a decision.  Others\r\nhave been pressing me and complaining bitterly of delay.  I think,\r\nhowever, that the sooner some of these cases can be treated as\r\nsubmitted for decision the better.  If the appointments are delayed\r\ntill the middle of Nov. there is little use of making temporary\r\nappointments, as the appointee would have to make two bonds.  If\r\nyou can in writing, confidentially if you prefer, give me your\r\nviews and submit any alternative suggestions for these places I\r\nwill carefully consider them.  But if you prefer to see me personally\r\nbefore any decision is made as to Collector of the Port I will of\r\ncourse lay that case to one side till the time you have suggested.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours,\r\n  \"B. H.\"\r\n\r\nI never became entirely estranged from him, however, and when his\r\nterm was about to expire, and he wanted a renomination, I supported\r\nhim.  My motive in so doing was not so much that I favored Harrison\r\nas because I felt outraged at the way _The Chicago Tribune_ had\r\ntreated me.  The _Tribune_ was then supporting Blaine with all its\r\npower, and I determined that Mr. Medill should not have his way;\r\nhence I became one of the leaders in the renomination of President\r\nHarrison.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Washington for the convention I called to see the\r\nPresident to learn what information he had to impart to me as one\r\nof the delegates who expected to support him.  He was more friendly,\r\nfree, and frank than he had ever been during his term as President.\r\nWe talked about different things, and in the course of the conversation\r\nhe adverted to Secretary Blaine.\r\n\r\nHarrison and Blaine had fallen out.  Jealousy was probably at the\r\nbottom of their disaffection.  Harrison did not treat Blaine with\r\nthat degree of confidence and courtesy one would expect from the\r\nChief Executive to the premier of his cabinet; while on the other\r\nhand Blaine hated Harrison and was plotting more or less against\r\nhim while he was a member of the cabinet.  The President talked\r\nvery freely about Mr. Blaine.  He declared that he had been doing\r\nthe work of the State Department himself for a year or more; that\r\nhe had prepared every important official document, and had the\r\noriginals in his own handwriting in the desk before him.  And yet,\r\nhe said, Mr. Blaine, as Secretary of State, was giving out accounts\r\nof what was being done in the State Department, taking all the\r\ncredit to himself.  He expressed himself as being perfectly willing,\r\nto use a familiar figure, to carry a soldier's knapsack when the\r\nsoldier was sore of foot and tired, and all that he wanted in return\r\nwas acknowledgment of the act and a show of appreciation.  This\r\nwas all he expected of Mr. Blaine.  He said, in closing the\r\nconversation, that he intended some day to disclose the true\r\ncondition of their relations.\r\n\r\nThe Harrison Administration was a very busy one, and should have\r\nbeen a very satisfactory one to the country at large.  The first\r\ngreat subject taken up by Congress was the tariff, the final\r\ndisposition of which was embodied in what afterwards became known\r\nas the \"McKinley Tariff Bill.\"  I never thought that Mr. McKinley\r\nshowed any particular skill in framing that tariff.  My understanding\r\nis that it was prepared by the majority of the Committee on Ways\r\nand Means.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturers of the country appeared before that committee\r\nand made known what protective duties they thought they ought to\r\nhave in order to carry on their industries, and the committee gave\r\nthem just about the rate of duty they desired.  It was a high\r\nprotective tariff, dictated by the manufacturers of the country.\r\nIt resulted in a great stimulus to the country's industries, and\r\ngreat prosperity followed its enactment.  It has been difficult\r\nfrom then till now to reduce duties below the McKinley rate.  The\r\nmanufacturers have since persisted and insisted upon higher duties\r\nthan they really ought to have.\r\n\r\nI may remark here, in passing, that the McKinley Law was not passed\r\nuntil October, and we were immediately plunged into the campaign.\r\nThe McKinley Law was the issue, and the Democrats swept everything\r\nbefore them, carrying the House by the overwhelming majority of\r\nninety-seven.  The Senate still remained Republican, forty-seven\r\nRepublicans to thirty-nine Democrats.  McKinley himself was beaten\r\nand never afterwards returned to Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is strange what a revolution periodically occurs among the voters\r\nof the United States.  When the Mills Bill was the issue the\r\nDemocratic party was beaten, and badly beaten; the Republican party\r\ncame into power; the McKinley Bill was passed, and we suffered\r\nabout as bad a defeat as had the Democrats two years previously.\r\nThe difference was that the Democrats were cleaned out on the shadow\r\nof an issue, without the reality (the Mills Bill never having become\r\na law), and we went down in defeat on the reality, the McKinley\r\nBill having become a law.\r\n\r\nIt was during this time also that the bill known as the Sherman\r\nLaw, or the Coinage Act of 1890, was passed, which directed the\r\npurchase of silver bullion to the aggregate of 4,500,000 ounces in\r\neach month, and the issuance for such purchases silver bullion\r\ntreasury notes.  This was probably the beginning of the silver\r\nagitation.  It created a long discussion in the Senate and House,\r\nand that subject was constantly before Congress until it was finally\r\nsettled by the election of McKinley, in 1896.\r\n\r\nIt was this Congress also that passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act\r\n(April 8, 1890).  It was one of the most important enactments ever\r\npassed by Congress; and yet, if it were strictly and literally\r\nenforced, the business of the country would have come to a standstill.\r\nThe courts have given it a very broad construction, making it cover\r\ncontracts never contemplated when the act was passed.  It was never\r\nseriously enforced until the coming in of the Roosevelt Administration,\r\nwhen the great prosperity brought about under the McKinley\r\nAdministration tended to the formation of vast combinations which\r\nseriously threatened the country.  The people do not seem disposed\r\nto consent even to its amendment, much less its repeal; and yet we\r\nall realize that if strictly enforced as construed by our courts,\r\nit would materially affect the business prosperity of the nation.\r\nThe people take the same attitude towards the Sherman Law as they\r\ntake toward the anti-pooling section of the Interstate Commerce\r\nAct; they will allow neither of them to be tampered with by Congress.\r\nThere has been considerable dispute as to the paternity of the\r\nSherman Anti-Trust Law.  Senator Hoar claims he wrote it; it bears\r\nSenator Sherman's name; and my own opinion is that Senator Edmunds\r\nhad more to do with framing it than any other one Senator.\r\n\r\nIt was during the first and second session of the Fifty-first\r\nCongress that the Federal Election Bill, so-called, or as it is\r\nfamiliarly known, the \"Force Bill,\" was discussed.  It was in charge\r\nof Senator Hoar, and occupied the attention of both sessions for a\r\nlong time.  The Republicans seemed determined to force it through,\r\nbut the Democrats from the South were bitterly opposed to it,\r\nresorting to all sorts of tactics to kill or delay it.\r\n\r\nThis measure I never considered much of a \"force\" bill.  I could\r\nnever see that there was any force to it, but on the contrary,\r\nconsidered it a very mild measure, and gave it my support.  The\r\nopposition to it was so bitter and strong and so skillfully managed\r\nby the late Senator Gorman on the part of the minority, and it\r\nstood for so long a time in the way of other legislation, that one\r\nafter Senator Wolcott arose in his seat and, very much to the\r\nastonishment of every one, moved to lay it aside and take up some\r\nother bill.  The motion carried, and that was the last we heard of\r\nthe Force Bill.\r\n\r\nThe McKinley Tariff, the Anti-Trust Law, the Sherman Coinage Act,\r\nand the Federal Election Bill were the important bills passed before\r\nthis Congress.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the magnificent record in the way of legislation\r\nmade by the first Congress under the Harrison Administration, the\r\nDemocratic victory was so complete that at the beginning of the\r\nfirst session of the Fifty-second Congress, which met December 7,\r\n1891, there were but eighty-eight Republicans in the House, as\r\nagainst two hundred and thirty-six Democrats, and Mr. Charles F.\r\nCrisp, of Georgia, was elected Speaker.  The Senate still remained\r\nin the control of the Republicans.\r\n\r\nIt was during this Congress that the silver agitation came to the\r\nfront as one of the foremost issues.  Senator Stewart of Nevada,\r\nintroduced his bill for the free coinage of gold and silver bullion.\r\nThe free coinage question consumed months of the time of both Senate\r\nand House, and finally came to naught.\r\n\r\nThe Act to establish the World's Fair at Chicago was passed.  I\r\ntook a very active interest in this in behalf of Chicago.  A meeting\r\nwas held in the Marble Room of the Capitol, where Senator Depew\r\nrepresented New York, and Colonel Thomas B. Bryan, Chicago.  They\r\neach made a speech.  Very much to my surprise, Colonel Bryan's was\r\nthe more effective.  We afterwards, by all sorts of efforts in the\r\nHouse and Senate, captured the location for Chicago.  The Fair,\r\nwhen it was finally held, was the greatest world's fair ever known.\r\nThere was an almost utter abandon in the expenditure of money, and\r\nCongress assisted by a liberal appropriation.  That Fair was a\r\ngreat injury, rather than a benefit, to the city of Chicago.  The\r\nhard times came on, and it was years before the city was restored\r\nto normal conditions.\r\n\r\nToward the end of this session, the Homestead riots were a subject\r\nof debate and investigation by Congress.  A Presidential campaign\r\nwas approaching, and the Democrats were eager to throw upon the\r\nRepublicans the blame for all labor disturbances, the riots at\r\nHomestead in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nCLEVELAND'S SECOND TERM\r\n1892 to 1896\r\n\r\nI have already, in other parts of these recollections, referred to\r\nthe National Convention of 1892, and the reasons which induced me\r\nto support President Harrison for renomination.  I attended as one\r\nof the delegates, and took a more or less active part in the work\r\nof the convention.  Harrison was chosen on the first ballot.  No\r\nother candidate had any chance.  Mr. Blaine and Mr. McKinley on\r\nthat ballot received one hundred and eighty-two votes each, but\r\nneither was really considered for the nomination.\r\n\r\nGrover Cleveland, of course, was the principal candidate before\r\nthe Democratic Convention, and had no serious opposition aside from\r\nthe bitter personal enmity evinced toward him by David B. Hill, of\r\nNew York, who had succeeded him as Governor of that State, and had\r\nhoped to succeed him as President.  Senator Hill has only recently\r\npassed away.  He was one of the most astute and ablest politicians\r\nin the history of the Democratic party.  President Cleveland\r\ndetermined, for some reason or other, to drive him out of public\r\nlife, and he succeeded in doing so during his second administration\r\nas President.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1892, just as the previous Presidential campaign\r\nhad been, was entirely fought out on the tariff issue; and the\r\nquestion in general was the McKinley Law and its results.  The\r\nDemocrats were able to show that there had been increase in cost\r\nin many articles regarded as necessaries, while the Republicans\r\npointed to a great era of national prosperity.  The Republicans\r\ncontended also that wages had advanced and prices declined under\r\nthe McKinley Law; but I have always doubted whether we were able\r\nto sustain that contention.  For instance, the department stores\r\nand retail merchants generally marked up prices, and wholly without\r\nreason, on articles on which there had been no increase in the\r\ntariff; and when asked why, they would reply, \"It is because of\r\nthe McKinley tariff.\"\r\n\r\nFor these economic reasons, added to the labor disturbances, Mr.\r\nCleveland was again elected President of the United States, and\r\ncarried with him for the first time both the Senate and the House.\r\nThe Democrats now had complete control of all branches of the\r\nGovernment, and were in a position, if united, to enact any\r\nlegislation they might desire.  The result of the election was a\r\ncomplete surprise to every one.  Why the voters should have turned\r\nagainst the Republican administration, it is hard to say.  Mr.\r\nHarrison's personality had much to do with it.\r\n\r\nThe times were never more prosperous.  In his message to the Congress\r\nwhich convened after his defeat, President Harrison appositely\r\nsaid:  \"There never has been a time in our history when work was\r\nso abundant, or when wages were so high, whether measured in the\r\ncurrency in which they are paid, or by their power to supply the\r\nnecessaries and comforts of life.\"  And yet, with this admitted\r\ncondition prevailing, the Democratic party was returned to power.\r\n\r\nI felt very badly over President Harrison's defeat, as I had done\r\neverything I could to secure, first, his renomination and then his\r\nre-election.  After the election I wrote President Harrison as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  \"U. S. Senate Chamber,\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., _Nov. 11, 1890_.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mr. President:--\r\n\r\n\"I have delayed writing you since the election for the reason that\r\nthe result so surprised me I scarcely knew what to make of it.  We\r\nlost Illinois by the overwhelming Democratic vote in Chicago.  I\r\nfeared that city all the time, but was assured by the committees\r\nthat it would not be very much against us.  I said all the time\r\nthat we would take care of the country and carry the State if the\r\nCook County vote could be kept below ten thousand Democratic, and\r\nwas assured by all hands there that it would be.  We did carry the\r\ncountry about as heretofore.  As things have gone bad nearly\r\neverywhere, I am not feeling so chagrined as I would if Illinois\r\nhad been the pivotal State.  I specially desire to say that the\r\ncause of the defeat does not lie at your door personally.  Any man\r\nin the country standing upon the doctrine of high protection would\r\nhave been defeated.  The people sat down upon the McKinley Tariff\r\nBill two years ago, and they have never gotten up.  They were\r\nthoroughly imbued with the feeling that the party did not do right\r\nin revising the tariff up instead of down.  They beat us for it in\r\n'90 and now again.\r\n\r\n\"Hoping to see you in ten days, I am, with great respect,\r\n\r\n  \"Truly yours,\r\n  \"S. M. Cullom.\"\r\n\r\nCurtis, in his work on the Republican party, in commenting on the\r\nresult of this election, said:\r\n\r\n\"It will be seen that to the Solid South were added, California,\r\nConnecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, New York, West Virginia,\r\nand Wisconsin; while Mr. Cleveland obtained one electoral vote in\r\nOhio, and five in Michigan.  The result was certainly disastrous,\r\nand left no doubt that the people at large for the time being had\r\nrebuked the Republican party for what they wrongly supposed to be\r\nagainst their best interests.  And yet, though a large majority of\r\nthe people had voted for Mr. Cleveland, they were probably sorry\r\nfor it within twenty-four hours after the election.  There was no\r\nsuch rejoicing as took place in 1885.  In fact, as soon as it was\r\ndetermined without doubt that the next Congress would be Democratic\r\nin both branches, and would enable Mr. Cleveland and his party to\r\ncarry out their threats to repeal the McKinley Law and enact in\r\nits stead a Free Trade measure, apprehension and alarm took possession\r\nof the industrial and financial interests of the country, and could\r\nthe election have been held over again within ten days, it may be\r\nestimated that a million or more votes would have been changed from\r\nthe Cleveland column to that of Harrison.  The people, as it were,\r\nawoke from a dream; they saw at once how they had been deceived by\r\nthe methods of the Democratic campaign managers, and how an incident\r\nwhich had no bearing whatever upon the issue of the campaign had\r\ninfluenced their vote in a time of temporary anger and resentment.\"\r\n\r\nThis perfectly sums up the situation, as I now recollect it, on\r\nthe election of President Cleveland; it was the beginning of the\r\nmost protracted era of hard times that this country has ever known.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland was inaugurated the second time on March 4, 1893,\r\nand, as Mr. Curtis says, there was very little enthusiasm.  The\r\nceremonies were quiet and unenlivened.\r\n\r\nOf course, it goes without saying, that I was not glad to see the\r\nDemocratic party returned to power; but I confess I was a little\r\npleased to meet President Cleveland in the White House again.  His\r\nmanner, his treatment of those with whom he came in contact, was\r\nso different from that of his predecessor, that it was a real\r\npleasure, rather than a burden, to call at the executive offices.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland promptly proceeded to remove Republicans from\r\nPresidential offices and appoint Democrats.  This even went to the\r\nextent of the removal of postmasters, large and small, against whom\r\nalmost any sort of charge might be trumped up.\r\n\r\nAdlai E. Stevenson was a past master in this respect.  He was First\r\nAssistant Postmaster-General under Cleveland's first Administration\r\nand removed Republican postmasters whose terms had not expired,\r\nwithout cause or reason.  He was elected Vice-President when Mr.\r\nCleveland again came into office.  He was a great favorite among\r\nthe Democrats, because he believed in appointing Democrats to every\r\noffice within the gift of the Executive.\r\n\r\nI remember, after Stevenson was elected, Senator Harris, of Tennessee,\r\nremarking to me:  \"Now we have got Cleveland and Stevenson elected,\r\nif Cleveland would drop out and Stevenson was President, we would\r\nget along finely.\"  He meant that Stevenson would never permit a\r\nsingle Republican to remain in office, if he could help it.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevenson made a popular presiding-officer of the Senate.  He\r\nhas been a strong Democrat all his life, and it has repeatedly been\r\ncharged against him, although I believe he denies it, that he was\r\na Southern sympathizer during the Civil War.  He served in Congress\r\ntwo terms, having been elected from the Bloomington district, and\r\nwas quite an influential member.  He was defeated as a candidate\r\nfor Vice-President with Mr. Bryan in 1900, and was also defeated\r\nas a candidate of the Democratic party for Governor of Illinois,\r\nin 1908.\r\n\r\nAs a candidate for Governor he made a splendid showing in 1908, as\r\nhe was defeated by 23,164 votes, while President Taft carried\r\nIllinois by 179,122.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland's Cabinet contained some very able men.  He\r\nappointed Judge Walter Q. Gresham as Secretary of State.  Why he\r\nshould have appointed Gresham, I do not know.  It would seem to me\r\nthat there were men of as much ability in his own party whom he\r\nmight have selected, but for some reason or other he did appoint\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nJudge Gresham was then serving as United States Circuit Judge, at\r\nChicago.  He had always been a Republican, and in the convention\r\nwhich nominated Harrison he received on one ballot one hundred and\r\ntwenty-three votes as the candidate of the Republican party for\r\nPresident of the United States.  He probably supported Mr. Cleveland,\r\nalthough of this I am not sure.  He was a bitter enemy of President\r\nHarrison,--so much so, indeed, that he could scarcely be polite to\r\nany one whom he thought favored Harrison.  He was holding court in\r\nSpringfield, during the Harrison Administration, when I met him,\r\nand, not appreciating his feeling, I casually commended President\r\nHarrison for some particular thing which I approved.  Gresham did\r\nnot like it, and he almost told me in so many words that he did\r\nnot think much of me or any one else who thought well of Harrison.\r\nWhereupon we separated somewhat coolly, I giving him to understand\r\nthat I would insist upon my views and my right to commend a man\r\nwho I thought was following a proper course.  I do not believe he\r\never avowed himself a Democrat, and in the State Department he\r\nalways declined to make any recommendations for appointments, on\r\nthe ground that he was not a Democrat, and that those appointments\r\nmust be left to the President himself.  I had more or less intercourse\r\nwith him as Secretary of State, and always found him polite and\r\nagreeable.  He was regarded as an able Secretary, and served in\r\nthat office until his death.\r\n\r\nRichard Olney succeeded him as Secretary of State.  He had been\r\nthe Attorney-General in the cabinet.  He was to me a much more\r\nsatisfactory Secretary than Judge Gresham, and fully as able as a\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\nJohn G. Carlisle was appointed Secretary of the Treasury.  He had\r\nbeen seven times elected to Congress and three times Speaker.  He\r\nresigned his seat in the House, having been elected as a member of\r\nthe Senate from Kentucky, and remained in the Senate until he\r\nresigned to accept the position of Secretary of the Treasury under\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nMr. Carlisle was in entire harmony with the President on the tariff\r\nand also on the monetary questions--and, indeed, I remark here that\r\nMr. Carlisle had very much to do toward the defeat of Mr. Bryan in\r\n1896.  Although a life-long Democrat himself, he believed that Mr.\r\nBryan's theories on the monetary question would ruin the country,\r\nand he stood with Mr. Cleveland in opposing his election.  Had\r\nCleveland, Carlisle, and other patriotic Gold Democrats stood with\r\ntheir party, Mr. Bryan would probably have been elected and the\r\nhistory of this country would have been written differently.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Cleveland's election, our industrial conditions became\r\nso depressed--and it was alleged by many that the cause for this\r\nwas the Sherman Coinage Act of 1890--that a special session of\r\nCongress was called to meet August 7, 1893.  The President said in\r\nhis message to this Congress:\r\n\r\n\"The existence of an alarming and extraordinary business situation,\r\ninvolving the welfare and prosperity of all our people, has\r\nconstrained me to call in extra session the people's representatives\r\nin Congress, to the end that through a wise and patriotic exercise\r\nfo the legislative duty with which they are solely charged, present\r\nevils may be mitigated and danger threatening the future may be\r\naverted. . . . With plenteous crops, with abundant promise of\r\nremunerative production and manufacture, with unusual invitation\r\nto safe investment, and with satisfactory returns to business\r\nenterprise, suddenly financial fear and distrust have sprung up on\r\nevery side. . . . Values supposed to be fixed are fast becoming\r\nconjectural, and loss and failure have involved every branch of\r\nbusiness.  I believe these things are principally chargeable to\r\nCongressional legislation touching the purchase and coinage of\r\nsilver by the general Government.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Cleveland earnestly recommended the prompt repeal of the\r\nSherman Coinage Act of 1890.\r\n\r\nThe extra session continued until October 30, when the Sherman Act\r\nwas finally repealed.\r\n\r\nBut the repeal of the Sherman Act did not at all remedy industrial\r\nconditions.  It was not the Sherman Act that was at fault, but the\r\nwell-grounded fear on the part of our manufacturers of the passage\r\nof a free trade measure.  The panic commenced, it is true, under\r\nthe McKinley Bill, but it was the direct result of what the business\r\ninterests felt sure was to come; and that was the passage of a\r\nDemocratic Tariff act.\r\n\r\nThe year 1893 closed with the prices of many products at the lowest\r\never known, with many workers seeking in vain for work, and with\r\ncharity laboring to keep back suffering and starvation in all our\r\ncities.  And yet, in view of the condition, Mr. Cleveland sent to\r\nCongress at the beginning of the annual session a free trade message,\r\nadvocating the repeal of the McKinley Act and the passage of a\r\nDemocratic free trade, or Tariff for Revenue, measure.  From the\r\ntone of this message, however, he seems to have changed somewhat\r\nfrom his message of 1887; yet it was strong enough to startle the\r\nbusiness interests, and make more widespread financial panic.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Crisp at once proceeded to the formation of the committees\r\nof the House, and particularly the Committee on Ways and Means.\r\n\r\nI was naturally anxious concerning our industries in Illinois, and\r\nI wanted one of our strongest Illinois Representatives placed on\r\nthat committee.  I happened to enjoy particularly friendly relations\r\nwith Mr. Crisp, he having been a House conferee on the Interstate\r\nCommerce Act of 1887, and I felt quite free to call upon him.\r\nAfter looking over the Illinois delegation, I came to the conclusion\r\nthat the Hon. A. J. Hopkins, my late colleague in the Senate, and\r\nwho was then serving in the House, was the very best man he could\r\nselect for that place.  I urged Mr. Crisp to appoint him, saying\r\nthat he was capable of doing more and better work on the committee\r\nthan any other man in the delegation.  Crisp was very nice about\r\nit, and whether he did it on my recommendation or not I do not\r\nknow; but he appointed Hopkins.  Senator Hopkins was, during his\r\nservice on that committee, regarded as one of its leading members,\r\nand had a prominent part in framing the Dingley tariff.  He served\r\nin the House until elected to the Senate, where he remained for\r\nsix years.  Senator Hopkins is an able man, and was constantly\r\ngrowing in influence and power in the Senate.  He was an agreeable\r\ncolleague, and I regretted very much indeed that he was not re-\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long for the Democratic majority of the Committee\r\non Ways and Means of the House to frame and report the Wilson Bill,\r\nrepealing the McKinley Bill, and recommending in its stead the\r\nenactment of a Tariff for Revenue, which was fairly in harmony with\r\nDemocratic Free Trade principles, and in harmony with the President's\r\nmessage.  The bill was passed without long delay, Mr. Reed leading\r\nthe ineffectual opposition to its passage in the House, with a\r\nspeech of great eloquence, in which he depicted conditions that\r\nwould surely arise after the passage of such a measure.\r\n\r\nBut this bill still had to run the gantlet of the Senate, where\r\nmany Democratic Senators did not sympathize to the full extent with\r\nthe Cleveland-Carlisle Free Trade theory.  Senators Gorman, Hill,\r\nMurphy, Jones, Brice, and Smith of New Jersey, led the opposition,\r\nuniting with the Republicans in securing some seven hundred\r\namendments, all in the interest, more or less, of Protection.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, we were all--Democrats as well as Republicans--trying\r\nto get in amendments in the interest of protecting the industries\r\nof our respective States.  I myself secured the adoption of many\r\nsuch amendments.  After I had exhausted every resource, I went to\r\nSenator Brice one day and asked him if he would not offer some\r\nlittle amendment for me, as I felt pretty sure that if Brice offered\r\nit it would be adopted, and I knew if I did it myself it stood a\r\ngood chance of being defeated.  Brice, by the way, was a very bluff,\r\nfrank man; he replied to me, half jocularly, \"Now, you know when\r\nyour party is in power you will never do anything for a Democrat,\r\nand I won't offer this amendment for you.  You go and get your\r\ncolleague, Senator Palmer, to offer it for you.\"  I left him and\r\nwent to General Palmer; he presented the amendment, and it was\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThe bill passed the Senate; and after going to conference, when it\r\nseemed likely the Conference Committee would not agree, the Democratic\r\nleaders of the House, fearing the bill would fail entirely, decided\r\nto surrender to the Senate and accept the Senate bill with all its\r\namendments.  President Cleveland denounced this temporizing, coining\r\nthe famous expression, \"party perfidy and party dishonor\" in the\r\nWilson letter, evidently referring to Mr. Gorman and other leaders\r\nof the Senate.\r\n\r\nThere has been endless controversy and discussion over the attitude\r\nof Senator Gorman on the Wilson Bill.  I myself have always believed\r\nthat Senator Gorman felt that the industries of the country could\r\nnot prosper under a Democratic Free Trade Tariff, and that he was\r\nwilling to afford them a certain amount of protection.  Especially\r\nwas he criticised on account of the sugar schedule.  Senator Tillman\r\nin his memorial address in the Senate, on the occasion of the\r\ndelivery of eulogies on Senator Gorman, said in reference to this:\r\n\r\n\"In the conversations I had with the Democratic leaders, it was\r\nclearly brought out that the sugar refineries were ready to contribute\r\nto the Democratic campaign fund if it could be understood that the\r\nindustry would be fostered and not destroyed by the Democratic\r\nTariff policy, and I received the impression, which became indelibly\r\nfixed on my mind then and remains fixed to this day, that President\r\nCleveland understood the situation and was willing to acquiesce in\r\nit if we won at the polls.  I did not talk with Mr. Cleveland in\r\nperson on this subject, though I called at his hotel to pay my\r\nrespects, and I am thoroughly satisfied that the charge of party\r\nperfidy and party dishonor was an act of the grossest wrong and\r\ncruelty to Senator Gorman.  If Mr. Cleveland, as I was told, knew\r\nof these negotiations and was the beneficiary of such a contribution,\r\nit is inconceivable how he could lend his great name and influence\r\ntoward destroying Senator Gorman's influence and popularity, in\r\nthe way he did.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Gorman himself was very justly indignant and displayed much\r\nfeeling when he addressed the Senate on July 23, 1894, replying to\r\nMr. Cleveland's letter.\r\n\r\nHe used, in part, the following language:\r\n\r\n\"As I have said, sir, this is a most extraordinary proceeding for\r\na Democrat, elected to the highest place in the Government, and\r\nfellow Democrats in another high place, where they have the right\r\nto speak and legislate generally, to join with the commune in\r\ntraducing the Senate of the United States, to blacken the character\r\nof Senators who are as honorable as they are, who are as patriotic\r\nas they ever can be, who have done as much to serve their party as\r\nmen who are now the beneficiaries of your labor and mine, to taunt\r\nand jeer us before the country as the advocates of trust and as\r\nguilty of dishonor and perfidy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a Democratic controversy, and I am not in a position to say\r\nwhether Mr. Cleveland or Mr. Gorman was right; whether it was a\r\nbargain in advance of the election to secure campaign funds; whether\r\nthe sugar schedule was framed to secure the support of the Louisiana\r\nSenators; but I do know that Mr. Cleveland's attacks on Mr. Gorman\r\nturned the State of Maryland over to the Republicans and relegated\r\nMr. Gorman to private life.\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Bill became a law without the approval of the President,\r\nMr. Cleveland taking the position that he would not permit himself\r\nto be separated from his party to such an extent as might be implied\r\nby a veto of the tariff legislation which, though disappointing to\r\nhim, he said was still chargeable to Democratic efforts.\r\n\r\nThere was one provision of the Wilson Bill which, I have been\r\nconvinced since, was a very wise measure, and which will yet be\r\nenacted into law; and that is the income tax provision.  That bill\r\nprovided for a tax of two per cent on incomes above four thousand\r\ndollars.  A separate vote was taken on this section and I voted\r\nagainst it.  It was Republican policy then to oppose an income-tax,\r\nand the view I took then was, that if we started out taxing incomes\r\nthe end would be that we would derive, from the source, sufficient\r\namount of revenue to run the Government and that it would gradually\r\nbreak down the protective policy.  It was declared unconstitutional\r\nby a vote of five to four of the Supreme Court.  A previous income-\r\ntax had been declared constitutional during the Civil War, and I\r\nam very strongly of the opinion that if the case is again presented\r\nto the Court the decision will be in harmony with the first decision,\r\noverruling the decision of 1895.  An income-tax is the fairest of\r\nall taxes.  It is resorted to by every other nation.  It falls most\r\nheavily on those who can best afford it.  The sentiment in the\r\nRepublican party has changed, and I believe that at no far distant\r\nday Congress will pass an income-tax as well as an inheritance-tax\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Wilson Bill increased, rather than diminished,\r\nthe hard times commencing with the panic of 1893.  The Democratic\r\nparty, or the free silver element of it, claimed that the panacea\r\nwas the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of sixteen\r\nto one.  The silver question was argued week after week in both\r\nbranches of Congress, and was never finally settled until the\r\nelection of McKinley and the establishment by law of the Gold\r\nStandard.  In recent years we hear very little about free silver;\r\nbut the Democratic party split on that issue, Mr. Cleveland heading\r\nthe faction in favor of sound money.\r\n\r\nIn those closing days of the Cleveland Administration, it was very\r\nseldom that a Democratic Senator was seen at the White House.  The\r\nPresident became completely estranged from the members of his party\r\nin both House and Senate, but it seemed to bother him little.  He\r\nwent ahead doing his duty as he saw it, utterly disregarding the\r\nwishes of the members of his party in Congress.\r\n\r\nI saw him many times during this period, and I remember on one\r\noccasion I had seen a notice in one of the papers indicating that\r\nthe President was about to appoint my old friend Mr. Charles Ridgely,\r\nof Springfield, Illinois, as Comptroller of the Currency.  I had\r\nthe highest regard for Mr. Ridgely, and I called at the White House\r\nto congratulate the President on the selection.  He seemed to be\r\nout of humor, and was more than usually abrupt.  He declared that\r\nhe knew nothing about it, that he did not know Ridgely, and never\r\nhad had any intention of appointing him.  I repeated that I had\r\nseen the announcement in a newspaper, adding that it looked to me\r\nas though the report were authentic, and that I only wanted to\r\ncongratulate him.  But the President merely reiterated, somewhat\r\ncurtly, that he knew nothing about it.  I became a little annoyed,\r\nfinally losing my temper.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care a damn whether you appoint him or not,\" I exclaimed;\r\n\"Ridgely's a Democrat, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon his attitude quickly changed, and he inquired about\r\nRidgely, listening with interest to what I had to say.  He then\r\ntalked with me on the silver question and other matters, detaining\r\nme while he kept his back to the crowd waiting to see him.  I almost\r\nhad to break away in order to give others a chance.\r\n\r\nAmong the other embarrassments and difficulties of the Cleveland\r\nAdministration were the famous Chicago riots of 1893.  The trouble\r\ngrew out of a railroad strike; much damage was done and a great\r\ndeal of property was destroyed, with consequent loss of life.  The\r\ncity itself seemed to be threatened, the business and manufacturing\r\ninterests appealed to the Governor first, and then to the President,\r\nto send troops to Chicago to protect property.  When the Governor\r\nfailed to act, the President ordered Federal troops to Chicago.\r\nThe action was regarded as very wise, and it endeared him to the\r\nbusiness people of that city.  Governor Altgeld protested, and that\r\nwas one of the reasons why he became Mr. Cleveland's most bitter\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nI think I should say a few words in reference to Governor Altgeld.\r\nHe has been called an anarchist and a socialist.  In my judgment,\r\nhe was neither.  Of his honesty, his integrity, his sincerity of\r\npurpose, his determination to give the State a good administration,\r\nI never had the slightest doubt.  The mainspring of the trouble,\r\nI believe, was an inability to select good men for public office.\r\nHe was not a good judge of men; he surrounded himself with a coterie\r\nthat betrayed his trust and used the State offices for personal\r\ngain.  I have always sympathized with Governor Altgeld.  Had he\r\nbeen eligible I believe he would have been the nominee of his party\r\nfor the Presidency; but he was born abroad.\r\n\r\nOne can scarcely imagine industrial conditions in a worse state\r\nthan they were at the close of the Cleveland Administration.  The\r\nelection of a Republican Congress in 1894 had helped some, but the\r\nrevenues were not sufficient to meet the ordinary running expenses\r\nof the Government; bonds had to be issued, labor was out of\r\nemployment, the mills and factories were closed, and business was\r\nat a standstill.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of affairs when the Republican National\r\nConvention assembled in 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nMcKINLEY'S PRESIDENCY\r\n1896 to 1901\r\n\r\nThe hard times, the business depression, all attributable to the\r\nWilson Tariff Bill, made the Republicans turn instinctively to\r\nGovernor McKinley, the well-known advocate of a high protective\r\ntariff, as the nominee of the Republican party, who would lead it\r\nto victory at the polls.\r\n\r\nThe Republican National Convention of 1896 was held at St. Louis.\r\nIt was one of the few national conventions which I failed to attend.\r\nSince entering the Senate, I have been usually honored by my party\r\ncolleagues in the State by being made chairman of the Illinois\r\ndelegation to Republican national conventions.  But for some reason\r\nor other--just why I do not now recollect--I was not a delegate to\r\nthe St. Louis Convention.  Congress was in session until near the\r\ntime when the convention was to meet, and Mr. McKinley, who, it\r\nwas well known, would be the nominee of the party, invited me to\r\nstop off in Canton on my way from Washington to Illinois and spend\r\na day with him.  I did so, arriving at Canton about nine in the\r\nmorning, Mr. McKinley meeting me at the station and driving me to\r\nhis house, where I remained until my train left at nine in the\r\nevening.  From his residence in Canton, I wired the Illinois\r\ndelegation, appealing them to vote for McKinley.  He received all\r\nbut two of the votes of the delegation.  He was nominated without\r\nany serious opposition, through the brilliant generalship of that\r\nmaster of party manipulation, the Hon. Marcus A. Hanna.\r\n\r\nI was talked about a little as a candidate for President during\r\nthe closing days of the Cleveland Administration.  I was urged to\r\nlend my name for the purpose, particularly by men in the East whom\r\nI always regarded as my friends.  I afterwards learned, although\r\nI was not so informed at the time, that they had determined to beat\r\nMcKinley at all hazards and nominate Speaker Reed if they could,\r\ntheir policy being to have the different States send delegations\r\nin favor of \"favorite sons.\"  Senator Allison was selected as the\r\n\"favorite son\" from Iowa, and efforts were made to carry the Illinois\r\ndelegation for me.  They hoped by this means, when the delegates\r\nassembled at St. Louis, to agree on some one, almost any one, except\r\nMcKinley--Reed if they could, or Allison, or me.\r\n\r\nMr. McKinley, through friends, about this time offered me all sorts\r\nof inducements to withdraw.  Judge Grosscup was the intermediary,\r\nand there was hardly anything in the Administration, or hardly any\r\npromise, he would not have made me if I had consented to withdraw.\r\nI felt that I could not do so.  When they found it was impossible\r\nto beg me off they determined to carry the State over me.  Money\r\nwas spent freely in characteristic Hanna fashion, his motto being,\r\n\"accomplish results.\"  McKinley was exceedingly popular, in addition,\r\nand after our State Convention had assembled and endorsed him, I\r\nwithdrew from the contest.  At the time I thought that if I could\r\nhave carried the delegation from my own State, as Senator Allison\r\ndid his, it would have broken the McKinley boom, and one or the\r\nother of us would have been nominated.  But as I look back on it\r\nnow, it seems to me that no one could have beaten McKinley; and\r\neven if he had lost Illinois, as he lost Iowa, he still would have\r\nhad sufficient delegates to secure his nomination.\r\n\r\nThe McKinley campaign was one of the most interesting and quite\r\nthe liveliest in which I have ever participated.  It was a campaign\r\nof education from beginning to end.  At first the Republicans tried\r\nto make the tariff the issue, and in a sense it remained one of\r\nthe most important; but we were soon compelled to accept silver as\r\nthe issue, and fight it out on that line.  Silver was comparatively\r\na new question; the people did not understand it, and they attended\r\nthe meetings, listening attentively to the campaign speeches.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable satisfaction in speaking during the campaign\r\nof 1896:  one was always assured of a large and interested audience.\r\nIn addition to this, the prevailing sentiment was one of cheerful\r\ngood-feeling; and while there had been several candidates before\r\nthe St. Louis Convention, including Speaker Reed, Senator Allison,\r\nand Levi P. Morton, the convention left no bitterness--the party\r\nwas united, and every Republican did his full duty.  Southern\r\nIllinois was a little uncertain; but it finally came around, and\r\nthe full Republican vote was cast for McKinley and Hobart.\r\n\r\nI took a very active part in this campaign.  Mr. McKinley was\r\nexceedingly polite to me and invited Senator Thurston and me to\r\nopen the campaign in Canton, which invitation I accepted, addressing\r\nthere a vast audience.  It was said that some fifty or seventy-five\r\nthousand people were assembled there that day.  Subsequently I\r\nspoke in Kentucky and Michigan, and made a thorough campaign in my\r\nown State.\r\n\r\nWhile the Republicans were united, the Democrats were hopelessly\r\ndivided.  The so-called Gold Democrats held a convention and\r\nnominated my colleague, Senator Palmer, and General Buckner as its\r\ncandidates for President and Vice-President respectively.  They\r\ndid not receive a very large vote, because I believe they advised\r\nthe Gold Democrats to vote for McKinley.  The Gold Democrats had\r\ngreat influence in the election.  General Palmer was thoroughly in\r\nearnest on the silver question, more so perhaps than any Democrat\r\nwhom I knew.  He believed strongly in the Democratic doctrine on\r\nthe tariff, and was a Democrat on every other issue; but he could\r\nnot follow his party in espousing free silver.\r\n\r\nThere was doubt all the time over the result of the election.\r\nAfter the Democratic convention was held in Chicago, and in the\r\nearly Summer and Fall, the Democrats certainly seemed to have the\r\nbest of it; but later in the campaign, as the people became educated,\r\nit began to look brighter.  I was very much surprised at the result,\r\nhowever.  McKinley carried the election by a vote of 7,111,000 as\r\nagainst 6,509,000 for Mr. Bryan, and the electoral vote by 271 as\r\nagainst 176 for Mr. Bryan.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. McKinley was inaugurated I cannot forget the expression\r\nof apparent relief in President Cleveland's face, as he accompanied\r\nhis successor to the ceremony.  He seemed rejoiced that he was\r\nturning his great office over to Mr. McKinley.  The last days of\r\nhis Administration had been troublesome ones.  Estranged from his\r\nown party, war clouds appearing in the near distance,--I do not\r\nwonder that he gladly relinquished the office.\r\n\r\nMr. McKinley came into office under the most favorable circumstances.\r\nA Congress was elected fully in harmony with him, whose members\r\ngladly acknowledged him as not only the titular, but the real head\r\nof the Republican party.  We never had a President who had more\r\ninfluence with Congress than Mr. McKinley.  Even President Lincoln\r\nhad difficulties with the leaders of Congress in his day, but I\r\nhave never heard of even the slightest friction between Mr. McKinley\r\nand the party leaders in Senate and House.\r\n\r\nIn many respects, President McKinley was a very great man.  He\r\nlooked and acted the ideal President.  He was always thoroughly\r\nself-poised and deliberate; nothing ever seemed to excite him, and\r\nhe always maintained a proper dignity.  He had the natural talent\r\nand make-up to be successful to a marked degree in dealing with\r\npeople with whom he came into contact.  He grew in popular favor\r\nfrom the day of his election until his death, and I have always\r\nmaintained that he would go down in history as our most popular\r\nPresident among all classes of people in all sections of the country.\r\nHis long training in public life--his service as a member of the\r\nHouse and Governor of Ohio--had well fitted him for the high office\r\nof President.  He had many favorites whom he desired to get into\r\noffice; and on many occasions, instead of going ahead and appointing\r\nhis friends without consulting any one, he asked me if I would have\r\nany objection to his appointing some personal friend living in\r\nIllinois to one office or another in or out of the State.  I always\r\nyielded; in fact it was impossible to resist him.\r\n\r\nIllustrating this, there happened to be a vacancy in a Federal\r\nJudgeship in Chicago.  Presidents usually have selected their own\r\njudges regardless of Senatorial recommendation, and McKinley selected\r\nhis; but he managed to secure Senatorial recommendation at the same\r\ntime.  I was in favor of the appointment of a certain lawyer in\r\nChicago whom I regarded as thoroughly well qualified for the place,\r\nand the President wanted to appoint Judge Christian C. Kohlsaat.\r\nMy colleague and I insisted for a long time on our recommendation.\r\nThe President and I debated the question frequently, he always\r\nlistening to me and seeming impressed with what I had to say, at\r\nthe same time remaining fully determined to have his own way in\r\nthe end.  Finally, when I was in the executive office one day, he\r\ncame over to where I was and, putting his arm on my shoulder, said:\r\n\"Senator, you won't get mad at me if I appoint Judge Kohlsaat,\r\nwill you?\"  I replied:  \"Mr. President, I could not get mad at you\r\nif I were to try.\"  He sent the nomination in; Judge Kohlsaat was\r\nconfirmed, and is now serving on the United States Circuit Bench.\r\n\r\nMr. McKinley wanted to appoint his old friend and commander, General\r\nPowell, as Collector of Internal Revenue at East St. Louis.  I did\r\nnot want General Powell to have the office, as I did not believe\r\nhe had rendered any service to the party sufficient to justify\r\ngiving him one of the general Federal offices in the State.  State\r\nSenator P. T. Chapman, who has since been elected to Congress\r\nseveral times, and Hon. James A. Willoughby, then a member of the\r\nIllinois State Senate, were both candidates, and I should have been\r\nvery glad to have had either one of them appointed.\r\n\r\nChapman came to Washington to my office, where he waited while I\r\nwent to the White House to attempt to have the matter of the\r\nappointment settled.  I saw the President, to whom I expressed a\r\nwillingness to have the post of Collector of Internal Revenue for\r\nthe East St. Louis District to go either to Chapman or Willoughby.\r\n\r\n\"Cullom,\" returned the President, \"if you had come to me this way\r\nin the first place, and urged me to appoint one of them, I would\r\nhave done it; but you have waited until everything is filled, and\r\nnow I must either appoint Powell to this place, or turn him out to\r\ngrass.\"  He continued:  \"I was a boy when I entered the army, and\r\nGeneral Powell took me under his wing; he looked after me, and I\r\nbecame very much attached to him.  I was standing only a little\r\nway off and saw him shot through.\"  The tears came to the President's\r\neyes and ran down his cheeks.  When I saw with what feeling he\r\nregarded the matter, I threw up my hands.\r\n\r\n\"I am through,\" said I; \"I have nothing more to say.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Powell was given the office.  This illustrates the manner\r\nin which Mr. McKinley always managed to get his own way in the\r\nmatter of appointments without the slightest friction with Senators\r\nand Representatives.\r\n\r\nDuring the early days of his Administration I did not feel so close\r\nto him as I had felt toward some of his predecessors.  I did not\r\nfeel that he quite forgave my not yielding to him, and declining\r\nto become a candidate for President in 1896.  He was always polite\r\nto me, as he was to every one, yet I could not but feel that he\r\nwas holding me at arm's length.  My colleague, Senator Mason, who\r\nwas an old friend of his, had secured a number of appointments,\r\nand the President himself was constantly asking me to yield to the\r\nappointment of this or that \"original McKinley man,\" mostly either\r\nmy enemies or men of whom I knew nothing.  I was much out of humor\r\nabout it, and several consular appointments having been made about\r\nthat time, I wrote some one in the State a letter setting forth\r\nthat those appointments were but the carrying out of promises made\r\nin advance of McKinley's nomination.  This letter, or a copy of\r\nit, was sent to the President.  I called at the White House one\r\nday concerning the appointment of some man, whose name I do not\r\nremember, but whom I regarded as my personal enemy.  I told him I\r\nhad no objection, but that I regarded the man as a jackass.  McKinley\r\nevidently did not like my remark very well; he reached back on his\r\ntable, pulled out this letter, or a copy of it, and asked me if I\r\nhad written it.  I replied that I did not know whether I had or\r\nnot, but that it sounded very much as I felt at the moment.  He\r\nsaid that he had not expected an expression of that sort from me.\r\nWhereupon we had a general overhauling, in the course of which I\r\ntold him with considerable feeling that I had been more or less\r\nintimate with every President since, and including, Mr. Lincoln,\r\nand had always been treated frankly and not held at arm's length;\r\nbut with himself that I had been constantly made to feel that he\r\nwas reserved with me.  We quarrelled about it a little, and finally\r\nhe asked me what I wanted done.  I told him.  He promptly promised\r\nto do it, and did.\r\n\r\nThat quarrel cleared the atmosphere, and we remained devoted friends\r\nfrom that day until his death.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the Hon. Marcus A. Hanna, Mr. McKinley would\r\nprobably never have been nominated or elected President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI knew Mr. Hanna very many years before he became identified with\r\nthe late President McKinley.  He always took an interest in Republican\r\npolitics, particularly in Ohio politics; and when Mr. Blaine was\r\na candidate for the Presidency, and I was campaigning in Ohio, I\r\nrode with Mr. Hanna from Canton to Massillon, some seven or eight\r\nmiles distant, where a great meeting was held, with Mr. Blaine as\r\nthe central figure.  I was even then very much impressed with Mr.\r\nHanna as a man of the very soundest judgment and common sense.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until Mr. McKinley became a candidate for President\r\nthat Hanna took a very great interest in national political affairs.\r\nHe had the deepest affection for the late President, and was\r\ndetermined that he should be nominated and elected President of\r\nthe United States, at whatever cost.  Mr. Hanna took hold of Mr.\r\nMcKinley's campaign for the nomination and controlled it absolutely\r\nand, to use the common expression, he \"ran every other candidate\r\noff the track.\"\r\n\r\nHe came into Illinois and carried the State easily.  He was not\r\nsparing in the use of money, but believed in using it legitimately\r\nin accomplishing results.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a great satisfaction to him when the St. Louis\r\nConvention nominated his candidate, William McKinley, of Ohio, on\r\nthe first ballot by a vote of 661 as against 84 votes for Thomas\r\nB. Reed, of Maine, the next highest candidate.  He had it all\r\norganized so perfectly that the St. Louis convention was perfunctory\r\nso far as Mr. McKinley's nomination was concerned.  The Convention\r\nrecognized that it was Mr. Hanna had achieved this great triumph;\r\nand after Senator Lodge, Governor Hastings, and Senators Platt and\r\nDepew had moved that the nomination of Mr. McKinley be made unanimous,\r\na general call was made for Mr. Hanna.  He finally yielded in a\r\nvery brief address:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Convention:--I am glad there\r\nwas one member of this Convention who has had the intelligence at\r\nthis late hour to ascertain how this nomination was made--by the\r\npeople.  What feeble effort I may have contributed to the result,\r\nI am here to lay the fruits of it at the feet of my party and upon\r\nthe altar of my country.  I am now ready to take my position in\r\nthe ranks alongside of my friend, General Henderson, and all good\r\nRepublicans from every State, and do the duty of a soldier until\r\nnext November.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, Mr. Hanna was made chairman of the Republican National\r\nCommittee, and as such conducted Mr. McKinley's campaign for election\r\njust as he had conducted the preliminary campaign for the nomination.\r\nHe there showed the shrewdest tact and ability in its management,\r\nand many people believe that he elected McKinley very largely by\r\nhis own efforts.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether Mr. Hanna was very ambitious to enter the\r\nSenate or not, but I do believe that Mr. McKinley saw that he would\r\nbe probably the most useful Senator to his Administration; and he\r\ncontrived to make a vacancy in the Senatorship from Ohio by inducing\r\nJohn Sherman to accept the position of Secretary of State in his\r\nCabinet, thereby making a place for Mr. Hanna in the Senate.\r\nSenator Sherman resigned to enter the State Department; and on\r\nMarch 5, 1897, Mr. Hanna was appointed by Governor Bushnell to fill\r\nthe vacancy.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first Mr. Hanna took rank as one of the foremost\r\nleaders of the Senate.  Of course, he had everything in his favor.\r\nHe had nominated and elected McKinley; he had been Chairman of the\r\nRepublican National Committee, and it was known that he stood closer\r\nto the President than any other man in public life.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding this, he had the real ability naturally to\r\nassume his place as a leader.  He assumed a prominent place more\r\nrapidly than any Senator whom I have ever known.  He took hold of\r\nlegislation with a degree of skill and confidence that was remarkable,\r\nand carried his measures thorough apparently by his own individual\r\nefforts and energy.  He changed the whole attitude of the Senate\r\nconcerning the route for an interoceanic canal.  We all generally\r\nfavored the Nicaraguan route.  Senator Hanna became convinced that\r\nthe Panama route was best, and he soon carried everything before\r\nhim to the end that the Panama route was selected.\r\n\r\nDuring the first McKinley campaign, Mark Hanna was probably the\r\nmost caricatured man in public life.  He was made an issue in the\r\ncampaign and was usually pictured as being covered with money-bags\r\nand dollars.  But it is very strange how public sentiment changed\r\nconcerning him.  Before the first McKinley Administration was over,\r\nMark Hanna enjoyed quite a degree of popularity; but it was not\r\nuntil he entered the campaign of 1900 that he really became one of\r\nthe popular figures in American politics.\r\n\r\nSome one, I do not know who, induced him to go among the people\r\nand show himself, and try to make some speeches.  His first few\r\nefforts were so successful that it was determined he should make\r\na speech-making tour.  Senator Frye, of Maine, one of the oldest\r\nand most experienced and finest orators in the country, accompanied\r\nhim on his tour.  Senator Frye told me that he prevailed upon\r\nSenator Hanna to make short campaign speeches first.  He requested\r\nhim to try a fifteen-minute speech, then extend them to thirty\r\nminutes.  Before their tour was ended, he was making just as long\r\nand just as good a speech as any old experienced campaigner.  During\r\nthis campaign, there were more calls on the Republican National\r\nCommittee for Senator Hanna than there were for any other campaign\r\nspeaker.  Everywhere he went he made friends, not only for President\r\nMcKinley, the nominee of the party, but for himself as well.  Mark\r\nHanna became one of the most popular leaders in the Republican\r\nparty, and I have never for a moment doubted that he could have\r\nbeen the nominee of the party for the Presidency in 1904, had he\r\nconsented to accept it.  He told me in a private conversation had\r\nbeen gratified when he had seen his great personal friend, Mr.\r\nMcKinley, twice elected President of the United States, and now\r\nthat he had passed away he had no particular ambition on his own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nMr. McKinley promptly proceeded to call a special session of\r\nCongress, which convened March 15, 1897, and in which Mr. Reed was\r\nelected Speaker of the House.  This session was called for the\r\npurpose of enacting a law for the raising of sufficient revenue to\r\ncarry on the Government; and on March 31 the Dingley Bill passed\r\nthe House.  The bill was debated in the Senate for several weeks,\r\nand after eight hundred and seventy-two amendments were incorporated,\r\nit passed the Senate July 7, 1897.  The conference report was agreed\r\nto, and the act was approved July 24, 1897.  The country was in\r\nsuch condition then that we heard no complaint concerning the high\r\nprotective tariff.  The Republicans were united in advocating such\r\na protective tariff as would enable the mills and factories to\r\nopen, thereby affording employment and restoring prosperity.\r\n\r\nFrom the election of President McKinley and the enactment of the\r\nDingley Law I do not hesitate to say that we can date the greatest\r\nera of prosperity, and the greatest material advancement, of any\r\nperiod of like duration in our history.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the Cleveland Administration and all during\r\nthe first part of the McKinley Administration, conditions were\r\nleading up inevitably to the Spanish-American War.  The enthusiasm\r\nof some Senators, especially Senator Proctor, of Vermont, and my\r\nown colleague, Senator Mason, of Illinois, became so intense that\r\nwar was brought on before the country was really prepared for it.\r\nMr. McKinley held back.  He knew the horrors of war and, if he\r\ncould avoid it, did not desire to see his country engage in\r\nhostilities with any other country.  He acted with great discretion,\r\nholding things steadily until some degree of preparation was made;\r\nand I have no doubt at all that the war would have been averted\r\nhad not the _Maine_ been destroyed in Havana harbor.  The country\r\nforced us into it after that appalling catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe entire Nation stood behind the President, and so did Congress.\r\nOne of the most dignified and impressive scenes I ever witnessed\r\nsince I became a member of the Senate was the passage of the bill\r\nappropriating fifty million dollars to be expended under the\r\ndirection of the President, in order to carry on the war.  The\r\nCommittee on Appropriations, of which I had long been a member,\r\ndirected Senator Hale to report the bill.  It was agreed in committee\r\nthat we should endeavor to secure its passage without a single\r\nspeech for or against it.  Some of the Senators who seemed disposed\r\nto talk, were prevailed upon to desist, and it was passed without\r\nany speeches.  The ayes and nays were called, and amid the most\r\nsolemn silence the bill was passed.  The galleries were crowded;\r\na great many members of the House were on the floor, and it reminded\r\nme of the days when the great Reconstruction legislation was being\r\nenacted, in the sixties.  It was a demonstration to the country\r\nand the world of our confidence in the President, and the determination\r\non the part of Congress to do what was necessary to uphold the\r\ndignity and honor of the United States.  The vote for the bill in\r\nthe Senate was unanimous.\r\n\r\nThe war came on immediately afterwards.  The history of it is yet\r\ntoo fresh in the minds of the people to need repetition here.  It\r\nwas soon over, and with its conclusion came new and greater\r\nresponsibilities.  Whether it was wise for the United States to\r\nassume these new responsibilities, I am not prepared to say.  Time\r\nalone can determine that.\r\n\r\nI have always had great sympathy for General Russell A. Alger, of\r\nMichigan, who was in President McKinley's Cabinet as Secretary of\r\nWar.  It was not his fault that conditions in the War Department\r\nwere as they existed in 1897, when he assumed office.  We must\r\nremember that the country had enjoyed a continuous period of peace\r\nfrom 1865 to 1898.  We were unprepared for war, and in the scramble\r\nand haste the Department of War was not administered satisfactorily,\r\nthe whole blame being laid upon General Alger.  It had been the\r\npolicy of the Democratic party in Congress to oppose liberal\r\nappropriations for the maintenance of the War Department and the\r\nArmy.  Many Republicans thought that the best means of limiting\r\nappropriations was in cutting down the estimates for the War\r\nDepartment.  They seemed to think that we would never again engage\r\nin a foreign war.\r\n\r\nGeneral Alger was a thoroughly honest man, of whose integrity I\r\nnever had any doubt.  He was made the scapegoat, and President\r\nMcKinley practically was forced by public sentiment to demand his\r\nresignation.  Personally, I have always believed the President\r\nshould have stood by General Alger.  I was much gratified when his\r\nown people in Michigan showed their confidence in him, very soon\r\nafter he was forced out of the McKinley Cabinet, by electing him\r\nto a seat in the United States Senate made vacant by the death of\r\nthe late Senator McMillan.\r\n\r\nDuring his Administration, President McKinley did me quite an honor\r\nby appointing me chairman of a commission to visit the Hawaiian\r\nIsland, investigate conditions there, and report a form of government\r\nfor those islands.  He appointed with me my colleague, Senator\r\nMorgan of Alabama, and my friend the Hon. R. R. Hitt, chairman of\r\nthe House Committee on Foreign Affairs.  In all my public life this\r\nwas the second executive appointment that I ever received, the\r\nfirst being from President Lincoln during the Civil War, to\r\ninvestigate commissary and quartermasters' accounts, to which I\r\nhave already referred.\r\n\r\nIt had been the well-known policy of the United States for many\r\nyears that in no event could the entity of Hawaiian statehood cease\r\nby the passage of the islands under the domination or influence of\r\nanother power than the United States.  Their annexation came about\r\nas the natural result of the strengthening of the ties that bound\r\nus to those islands for many years.  The people had overthrown the\r\nmonarchy and set up a republic.  It seemed certain that the republic\r\ncould not long exist, and they appealed to the United States for\r\nannexation.  The treaty of annexation was negotiated and then\r\nratified by Hawaii, but it was withdrawn by President Cleveland\r\nbefore the Senate acted upon it; finally, the islands were annexed\r\nby the passage of an act of Congress during the McKinley\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nIt was under these circumstances that Senator Morgan, Mr. Hitt,\r\nand I visited the islands.  The appointment came about in this way.\r\nI had been urging the President to appoint Mr. Rheuna Lawrence, of\r\nSpringfield, Illinois, as one of the commissioners.  The Hon. James\r\nA. Connolly, then representing the Springfield district in Congress,\r\nhad also been very active in trying to secure Lawrence's appointment.\r\nHe came to me in the Senate one day and told me that there was no\r\nchance of Lawrence being appointed and that the President had\r\ndetermined to appoint me.  I told Connolly I did not see how I\r\ncould accept an appointment, under the circumstances, and that\r\nLawrence might misunderstand it.  Connolly said he thought I must\r\ntake the place.  The President himself afterwards talked with me\r\nabout it.  I hesitated.  He urged me, insisting that I could not\r\nvery well afford to decline.  Finally I said that if he insisted,\r\nI would accept.  He nominated us to the Senate for confirmation.\r\nThis precipitated considerable debate in the Senate, for, by the\r\nmember of the Committee on the Judiciary, the appointment of Senators\r\nand members on such a commission was regarded as unconstitutional;\r\nbut the committee determined to take no action on the nominations\r\nat all, so we were neither confirmed nor rejected.  President\r\nMcKinley urged us to go ahead, however, visit the islands, and make\r\nour report, which we did.  This was the beginning of expansion, or\r\nImperialism, in the campaign of 1900.\r\n\r\nOne writer, in speaking of the acquisition of these islands, said:\r\n\r\n\"One of the brightest episodes in American history was the acquisition\r\nof the Hawaiian Islands, and Senator Cullom's name is prominently\r\nassociated with that act.  He read aright our history as a nation\r\nof expansionists.  He was not afraid to permit the great republic\r\nto become greater.  He deemed it wise that to the lines of our\r\ninfluence on land should be added a national influence on the seas.\r\nThis view was accepted by the people and by the national Legislature.\r\nBy President McKinley, Senator Cullom was appointed chairman of\r\nthe Hawaiian Commission, composed of Senator Morgan of Alabama,\r\nand Congressman Hitt of Illinois, and Senator Cullom, to visit the\r\nislands and frame a new law providing for their civil government\r\nand defining their future relations with the United States.  Since\r\nthe days of Clyde in India, few men have been clothed with a more\r\nimportant duty than this commission, whose mission it was to prepare\r\na Government for the Hawaiian Islands.  The bill recommended by\r\nthe commission was enacted by Congress, and stands as the organic\r\nlaw of the islands to-day.\"\r\n\r\nWe had an exceedingly interesting time in the Hawaiian Islands.\r\nThey were not known so well then as they are to-day.  We visited\r\nseveral of the islands composing the group, and publicly explained\r\nour mission.  The people seemed to have the impression that American\r\noccupancy of the islands was only temporary, and that as soon as\r\nthe Spanish-American War was over they would return to old conditions.\r\nWe told them that annexation was permanent, and they would remain\r\na part of the United States for all time to come.  I did not favor\r\ngiving them statehood.  There was not a sufficient number of whites\r\nand educated natives to justify giving them the franchise as an\r\nindependent State in the American Union.  Senator Morgan and I\r\ndiffered on this a great deal, and on several occasions in the\r\nhearings of the commission, he stated that they were to become a\r\nState.  I always interposed to the effect that, so far as my\r\ninfluence was concerned, they would remain a Territory.\r\n\r\nThere was one island of the group called Molokai devoted entirely\r\nto the care of lepers, leprosy being quite common in the Hawaiian\r\nIslands.  We deemed it our duty to visit this island as well as\r\nthe others.  It was one of the most interesting and pathetic places\r\nof which the human mind can conceive--a place of grim tragedies.\r\nThere were about twelve hundred lepers on the island, divided into\r\ntwo colonies, one at each end of the island.  The island itself\r\nforms a natural fortress from which escape is almost impossible,\r\nthe sea on one side and mountains on the other.  We spent the day\r\nthere and ate luncheon on the island.  We saw the disease in all\r\nits stages.  We entered a schoolhouse in which there were a crowd\r\nof young girls ranging from ten to sixteen years of age.  They were\r\nall lepers.  They sang for us.  It was very pathetic.  We visited\r\nthe cemetery and saw the monument erected to the memory of a Catholic\r\npriest, Father Damien, who went there from Chicago, to devote his\r\nlife to the spiritual care of the unfortunates, but who, like all\r\nothers residing on the island, finally succumbed to the disease.\r\nWe met an old lady at the cemetery and I asked her if there was\r\nany danger of contracting the disease.  She said there was not\r\nunless we had some abrasions on the skin, and advised us as a matter\r\nof caution to wear gloves.  I promptly put mine on and kept them\r\non until I left the island.\r\n\r\nI was told that they expected me to speak to them, and I did make\r\nthem a speech.  A large number of them assembled.  I have addressed\r\nmany audiences in my life, but this was the queerest I was ever\r\nobliged to face.  There were men and women in all stages of the\r\ndisease.  Leprosy attacks the fingers and they fall off, and some\r\nnatural instinct prompts the victim to hide his hands; but as my\r\nspeech was translated to them, in the excitement they would forget\r\nand throw out their hands and applaud.  It was a hideous sight and\r\nI most fervently wish never to see the like of it again.\r\n\r\nFor our expenses one hundred thousand dollars had been appropriated.\r\nI am not one of those who believe in lavish expenditures of public\r\nmoney by commissions.  While I was willing as chairman of the\r\ncommission to permit travelling expenses and the reasonable\r\nnecessaries and probably the luxuries of life while abroad, yet I\r\ndiffered with my colleague, Senator Morgan, and insisted that no\r\nmoney should be spent for entertaining.  Out of the hundred thousand\r\ndollars we spent something like fifteen thousand; and Senator\r\nMorgan, Mr. Hitt, and I agreed that it would not be lawful or right\r\nfor us to accept any compensation for our services as members of\r\nthe commission.  Something like eight-five thousand dollars reverted\r\nto the Treasury.\r\n\r\nWe returned and made our report to Congress, and the bill which we\r\nrecommended was enacted.  I do not think the present form of\r\ngovernment of Hawaii will be changed for many years to come.  I\r\nhave regretted exceedingly that, despite the repeated recommendations\r\nof Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt, Congress has not seen fit to\r\nmake an appropriation to improve the harbor and fortify the islands.\r\nIt is true they afford us a coaling station in the middle of the\r\nPacific, but that is all.  Should hostilities break out in the Far\r\nEast, our country being a party, it would be almost impossible for\r\nus to defend them, and they would become easy prey to foreign\r\naggression.  I hope that this policy will change in the near future,\r\nand that Pearl Harbor will be improved and the islands fortified.\r\n\r\nThe important events of the first McKinley Administration were the\r\nenactment of the Dingley Tariff, the successful conclusion of the\r\nwar with Spain, the ratification of the Treaty of Peace, the\r\nindependence of Cuba, and the acquisition of Porto Rico, the\r\nPhilippines, and the Island of Guam; the establishment of the gold\r\nstandard by law, and the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Administration no one questioned that the\r\ncountry was in a more prosperous condition than it ever had been\r\nbefore, and that McKinley was probably the most popular President\r\nthat ever occupied the White House.  He was unanimously nominated\r\nat the Republican Convention, at Philadelphia, for a second term.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1900 was fought out on the issue of Imperialism;\r\nthe tariff was almost forgotten, and the silver question was only\r\ndiscussed incidentally.\r\n\r\nMr. McKinley's popular vote was not much greater than it was in\r\n1896.  He received 7,207,000 as against 6,358,000 votes cast for\r\nMr. Bryan.\r\n\r\nDuring the short session which convened after his election, the\r\nPlatt amendment concerning our future relations with Cuba was\r\npassed.  The War Revenue Act was reduced.  It was an uneventful\r\nsession, and Mr. McKinley was again inaugurated March 4, 1901.\r\n\r\nOn September 6, 1901, the President attended the Buffalo Exposition,\r\naccompanied by Mrs. McKinley and the members of his cabinet, and\r\nduring the reception which he held at the Temple of Music on that\r\nday, he was shot and wounded by an assassin, one Leon F. Czolgosz.\r\nAfter lingering along until Saturday, September 14, he passed away,\r\nand Theodore Roosevelt, Vice-President, was sworn in as President\r\nof the United States.  On taking the oath of office, he uttered\r\nbut one sentence:\r\n\r\n\"I wish to say that it shall be my aim to continue absolutely\r\nunbroken the policy of President McKinley for the peace, prosperity,\r\nand the honor of our beloved country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\nROOSEVELT'S PRESIDENCY\r\n1901 to 1909\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt served as President of the United States from\r\nSeptember 13, 1901, to March 4, 1909.  What he accomplished during\r\nthose years is still too fresh in the minds of the people of the\r\nUnited States to justify its recital by me here; suffice it to say\r\nthat he gave one of the best Administrations ever known in the\r\nhistory of the United States.  He accomplished more in that term\r\nthan any of his predecessors; more laws were enacted, laws of more\r\ngeneral benefit to the people; but above all, his Administration\r\nenforced all laws on the statute books as they had never been\r\nenforced before.\r\n\r\nThe Sherman Anti-Trust Law was a dead letter until Mr. Roosevelt\r\ninstructed the Attorney-General to prosecute its violators, both\r\ngreat and small.  No fear or favor was shown in the enforcement of\r\nthe laws against the rich and poor alike.  There were many other\r\nnotable features of his administration, but that, to my mind, stands\r\nout conspicuously before all the others.  By his speeches, by his\r\npublic messages, he awakened the slumbering conscience of the\r\nNation, and he made the violators of the law in high places come\r\nto realize that they would receive the same punishment as the lowest\r\noffenders.  He did more than any of his predecessors to prevent\r\nthis country from drifting into socialism.\r\n\r\nI have known Colonel Roosevelt for many years.  I knew him as Civil\r\nService Commissioner under President Harrison.  In that position,\r\nas in every other public office he held, he saw to it that the law\r\nwas strictly enforced.  I once wrote him a note, when he was Civil\r\nService Commissioner, requesting him to act favorably on some\r\nmatter, which he considered was contrary to his duty.  He promptly\r\nreturned this characteristic reply:  \"You have no right to ask me\r\nto do this, and I have no right to do it.\"\r\n\r\nAs Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President McKinley, he\r\nwas able, aggressive, and pushing in preparing the Navy for the\r\nSpanish-American War.  He seemed so interested in what he was doing\r\nthat he would appear to an outsider to be nervous and excitable.\r\nMy old friend, the Hon. W. I. Guffin, than whom there was no better\r\nman, was visiting the Department with me one day, and I took occasion\r\nto introduce him to Colonel Roosevelt, who was then Assistant\r\nSecretary. Guffin was astonished at Roosevelt's manners and his\r\nway of speaking, and I recall Guffin's remark when we left the\r\noffice.  I was very much amused at it.  He said:  \"Well, that is\r\nRoosevelt, is it!  He is one hell of a Secretary.\"  Doubtless that\r\nwas the impression that Colonel Roosevelt left on many people whom\r\nhe met in the Navy Department, who did not know him and who had\r\nnot yet come to know the degree of promptness and ability with\r\nwhich he despatched public business.\r\n\r\nI was at the Philadelphia Convention which nominated Colonel\r\nRoosevelt for Vice-President.  I know that he did not desire the\r\nnomination, but it was thrust on him through the manipulation of\r\nSenator T. C. Platt, of New York, then the acknowledged \"easy boss\"\r\nof that State.  Platt himself said afterwards that he did it to\r\nget rid of him as Governor of New York, and that he regretted it\r\nevery day of his life after Roosevelt became President.  The\r\npoliticians of New York did not want Roosevelt in control at Albany,\r\nand they thought it would be an admirable plan to remove him from\r\nthe State, and eventually relegate him to private life--to nominate\r\nhim for Vice-President.  But the fates willed differently, and the\r\nnomination for Vice-President opened the way for him to become Mr.\r\nMcKinley's successor, in which position he made such a splendid\r\nrecord that no one thought of opposing him for the nomination for\r\nPresident in 1904.\r\n\r\nAs President, Colonel Roosevelt was not popular with Senators\r\ngenerally.  Personally, I got along with him very well.  In all\r\nthe years that he was President, I do not think he ever declined\r\nto grant any favor that I asked of him, with one exception.  In\r\nthat case, while he declined to give a very distinguished gentleman\r\nin Illinois a position, for which I thought him admirably qualified,\r\nand for which I was urging him, he later tendered him another\r\noffice, which my friend declined to accept.  His methods of\r\ntransacting business were far more expeditious than those of any\r\nof his predecessors.  President McKinley, in every case, insisted\r\non Senators placing in writing their recommendations for Federal\r\noffices; I do not think he ever made an appointment without such\r\nwritten endorsements; but Colonel Roosevelt never bothered much\r\nabout written endorsements.  He would either do or not do what you\r\nasked, and would decide the question promptly.\r\n\r\nHe took a deep interest in the passage of the necessary amendments\r\nto the Interstate Commerce Act, and as I have said elsewhere, had\r\nit not been for Colonel Roosevelt, the Hepburn Bill would not have\r\nbeen passed.  He thought that I could be of very great service in\r\nsecuring the passage of the amendments which both he and I deemed\r\nnecessary to the Interstate Commerce Act, by remaining chairman of\r\nthe Senate's Committee on Interstate Commerce, and when the time\r\ncame for me to decide whether I should remain chairman of that\r\ncommittee, or accept the chairmanship of the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations, he took occasion personally to urge me to remain at the\r\nhead of the Interstate Commerce Committee.  But at the time the\r\npersonnel of the committee was such that I had despaired of securing\r\nfavorable action in the committee on an amended Interstate Commerce\r\nAct, and I retired to accept the chairmanship of the Committee on\r\nForeign Relations.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt has proven over and over again, in every position\r\nhe has occupied, from Police Commissioner of New York to the\r\nPresidency itself, that he is a marvellous man, a man of great\r\nresources, great intellect, great energy and courage, and a man of\r\nthe highest degree of integrity.  He will go down in the history\r\nof this country as the most remarkable man of his day.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John Hay, at the urgent request of Colonel Roosevelt,\r\ncontinued to act as Secretary of State (to which position he had\r\nbeen appointed by President McKinley) until his death in 1905.\r\nJohn Hay was the most accomplished diplomat, in my judgment, who\r\never occupied the high position of Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nI knew him from his boyhood, and knew his father and all the members\r\nof his family.  The Hon. Milton Hay, whom I have mentioned elsewhere,\r\nand who was my law partner, was an uncle of John Hay.  John was a\r\nstudent in our law office in Springfield, and as a student of the\r\nlaw he showed marked intellectual capacity and grasp.  It was from\r\nour law office that President Lincoln took him to act as one of\r\nhis private secretaries when he left Springfield for Washington to\r\nbe inaugurated as President of the United States, and Mr. Hay\r\ncontinued to act as such until the President's death.  He abandoned\r\nthe law as a profession and became finally the editor of _The New\r\nYork Tribune_.  I probably knew him more intimately than any one\r\nelse in public life, and when Mr. McKinley became President I urged\r\nhim to appoint Hay as Ambassador to Great Britain.  He served in\r\nthat position with great credit to himself and his country.  He\r\nwas very popular with the members of the British Government, and\r\nseemed to have more influence, and to be more able to accomplish\r\nimportant results, than any of his predecessors in that office.\r\nWhen it was rumored that there was to be a vacancy in the State\r\nDepartment, by the retirement of Mr. Day, who was ambitious to go\r\non the Federal Bench, I wrote Mr. McKinley a letter, in which I\r\ntold him that he could find no better man to succeed Mr. Day as\r\nSecretary than his Ambassador to Great Britain, John Hay.  And he\r\nwas appointed.\r\n\r\nAs Secretary of State, Mr. Hay was successful in carrying to a\r\ntriumphant conclusion our Far Eastern diplomacy.  For years the\r\nsituation in the Far East, and especially in China, had been delicate\r\nand critical to an extreme.  The acquisition of Hawaii and the\r\nPhilippines gave to the United States an extraordinary interest in\r\nevents occurring in the Orient.  The United States stood for the\r\n\"open door\" in China; and as the result of the diplomacy and\r\ninfluence of Secretary Hay, freedom of commerce was secured, and\r\nthe division of China among the powers has been prevented.  In our\r\nrelations with China, we have pursued a disinterested policy of\r\ndisavowal of territorial aggrandizement, and a disposition to\r\nrespect the rights of that Government, confining our interests to\r\nthe peaceful development of trade.  Secretary Hay never hesitated\r\non all proper occasions to assert our influence to preserve its\r\nindependence and prevent its dismemberment.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries China had been a hermit nation, successfully\r\nresisting foreign influence and invasion; but gradually, on one\r\npretext or another, she was compelled to open her ports, and Great\r\nBritain, Russia, and Germany had gained special advantages and\r\nexceptional privileges in portions of China, where, under the guise\r\nof \"spheres of interest,\" they were exercising considerable control\r\nover an important part of that Empire.  It seemed probable that\r\nnot only would these nations absorb the trade of China, but that\r\nthe Empire itself would be dismembered and divided among the powers.\r\nTo prevent this, Secretary Hay advanced the so-called \"open door\"\r\npolicy and successfully carried it out.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1899, he addressed communications to the Governments\r\nof Great Britain, Russia, Germany, Italy, and Japan, suggesting\r\nthat, as he understood it to be the settled policy and purpose of\r\nthose countries not to use any privileges which might be granted\r\nthem in China as a means of excluding any commercial rival, and\r\nthat freedom of trade for them in that ancient empire meant freedom\r\nof trade for all the world alike, he considered that the maintenance\r\nof this policy was alike urgently demanded by the commercial\r\ncommunities of these several nations, and that it was the only one\r\nwhich would improve existing conditions and extend their future\r\noperation.  He further suggested that it was the desire of the\r\nUnited States Government that the interests of its citizens should\r\nnot be prejudiced through exclusive treatment by any of the\r\ncontrolling powers within their respective spheres of interest in\r\nChina, and that it hoped to retain there an open market for all\r\nthe world's commerce, remove dangerous sources of international\r\nirritation, and promote administrative reform.  Secretary Hay\r\naccordingly invited a declaration by each of them in regard to the\r\ntreatment of foreign commerce in their spheres of interest.  Without\r\ninconsiderable delay the Governments of Great Britain, Russia,\r\nGermany, Italy, and Japan replied to his circular note, giving\r\ncordial and full assurance of endorsement of the principles suggested\r\nby our Government.  Thus was successfully begun the since famous\r\n\"open door\" policy in China.\r\n\r\nBut this great triumph in the interest of the freedom of the world's\r\ncommerce was followed by the Boxer outbreak of 1900.  The German\r\nMinister was murdered in the streets of Peking, the legations were\r\nattacked and in a state of siege for a month.\r\n\r\nThe Boxer outbreak was made the occasion of a joint international\r\nexpedition for the relief of the diplomatic representatives and\r\nother foreigners whose lives were in peril.  Congress was not in\r\nsession, but on Secretary Hay's advice, there was despatched a\r\ndivision of the American Army composed of all arms of the service.\r\nThis almost amounted to a declaration of war, or the waging of war\r\nwithout the consent of Congress.  The Executive was justified,\r\nhowever, and did not hesitate to assume the responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the intense excitement throughout the world, when\r\nthe downfall of the Empire of China seemed almost certain, Secretary\r\nHay, with the foresight which always distinguished his official\r\nacts, issued a circular note on July 3, 1900, to all the powers\r\nhaving interests in China, stating the position of the United\r\nStates; that it would be our policy to find a solution which would\r\nbring permanent safety and peace to China, preserve its territorial\r\nand administrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed by treaty\r\nand international law, and safeguard for the world the principle\r\nof equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire.\r\nSecretary Hay's note gave notice to the world that the United States\r\nwould not permit the dismemberment of China, and it was so in accord\r\nwith the principles of justice that it met with the approval of all.\r\n\r\nAfter the relief of the legations and the suppression of the Boxer\r\ntroubles by the allied powers, there followed a long period of\r\nnegotiation, and an enormous and exorbitant demand was made by the\r\nallies as an indemnity.  So exorbitant was it as first that China\r\nprobably never would have been able to pay.  Secretary Hay constantly\r\nintervened to reduce the demands of the powers and cut down to a\r\nreasonable limit the enormous indemnity they were seeking to exact.\r\nFinally the protocol of 1901 was signed, imposing very heavy and\r\nhumiliating burdens on China.  It has been the province of the\r\nUnited States to alleviate these burdens, and we have only recently\r\nremitted a very large portion of the indemnity which was to have\r\ncome to the United States.\r\n\r\nLater, Secretary Hay negotiated a very favorable commercial treaty\r\nwith China which further strengthened the \"open door,\" gave increased\r\nprivileges to our diplomatic and consular officers, and to our\r\ncitizens in China, and opened new cities to international trade\r\nand residence.\r\n\r\nOne of Secretary Hay's last acts in the State Department was another\r\ndiplomatic triumph in the interest of China.  It had been apparent\r\nfor some time that war between Russia and Japan was inevitable,\r\nand Mr. Hay realized that war might seriously impair the integrity\r\nof China and the benefits of the \"open door\" policy.  Immediately\r\nafter the war commenced, therefore, on February 10, 1904, Mr. Hay\r\naddressed to the Governments of Russia, Japan, and China, and to\r\nall other powers having spheres of influence in China, a circular\r\nnote in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"It is the earnest desire of the Government of the United States\r\nthat in the military operations which have begun between Russia\r\nand Japan, the neutrality of China, and in all practicable ways\r\nher administrative entity, shall be protected by both parties, and\r\nthat the area of hostilities shall be localized and limited as much\r\nas possible, so that undue excitement and disturbance of the Chinese\r\npeople may be prevented, and the least possible loss to the commerce\r\nand peaceful intercourse of the world may be occasioned.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hay's proposition was commended by the world and was accepted\r\nby the neutral nations, and also by China, Russia, and Japan.\r\n\r\nSecretary Hay's measures respecting China were of the greatest\r\nimportance and significance, because they not only tended to the\r\npeace of the world, but they have preserved the extensive territory\r\nand enormous population of that empire to the free and untrammelled\r\ntrade and commerce of all countries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to securing from Great Britain, through the Hay-Pauncefote\r\ntreaty, the abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, thereby making\r\nit possible for the United States to construct the Isthmian Canal,\r\nSecretary Hay succeeded in settling the controversy over the Alaskan\r\nboundary, which had been a subject of dispute between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain for half a century.  The treaty of 1868,\r\nbetween the United States and Russia, by which we acquired Alaska,\r\nin describing the boundary of Alaska, adopted the description\r\ncontained in the treaty of 1825, between Great Britain and Russia.\r\nYears ago it was discovered that the boundary described in the\r\ntreaty of 1825 was incorrect as a geographical fact.\r\n\r\nWhile the country remained unsettled the definite boundary was not\r\nso material, but since the first Cleveland Administration the\r\nAlaskan boundary had been an important subject of dispute.  The\r\nfeeling among our people in Alaska and among the Canadians became\r\nvery bitter.  This was one of the principal reasons for the creation\r\nof the Joint High Commission in 1899, whose purpose it was to settle\r\nall outstanding questions between the United States and Canada,\r\nthe principal one being the Alaskan boundary.  The Joint High\r\nCommission made considerable progress in adjusting these questions,\r\nbut failing to reach an agreement as to the Alaskan boundary, the\r\ncommission adjourned without disposing of any of the subjects in\r\ncontroversy.  President Roosevelt and Secretary Hay, in view of\r\nour long and undisputed occupation of the territory in question,\r\ndeclined to allow the reference of the Alaskan boundary to a regular\r\narbitration at the Hague, but instead, Secretary Hay proposed the\r\ncreation of a judicial tribunal composed of an equal number of\r\nmembers from each country, feeling confident that our claim would\r\nbe successfully established by such a body.  There was very great\r\nopposition, and there were many predictions of failure, but on\r\nJanuary 24, 1903, a treaty between the United States and Great\r\nBritain was signed, providing for such a tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was duly ratified, and the tribunal appointed, and on\r\nOctober 20, 1903, reached a conclusion which was a complete victory\r\nfor the United States, sustaining as it did every material contention\r\nof our Government.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Alaskan boundary was a very notable diplomatic\r\ntriumph, and Secretary Hay is entitled to much credit for it.\r\n\r\nI cannot go into the many important matters which Mr. Hay disposed\r\nof as Secretary of State.  He left a splendid record.  I made it\r\na point to keep in constant touch with him by visiting at his office\r\nfrequently, and he always talked with me frankly and freely concerning\r\nthe important negotiations in which he was engaged.  The only\r\ncriticism I have to make of him as Secretary of State is, that he\r\nwas disposed, wherever he could possibly do so, to make international\r\nagreements and settle differences without consulting the Senate.\r\nAnd, in addition, I never could induce him to come before the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations and explain to the committee personally\r\nvarious treaties and important matters in which the State Department\r\nwas interested.  Why he would not do so I do not know.  He was an\r\nexceedingly modest man and shrank from all controversy.  It is\r\nseldom, however, that the State Department has had at its head so\r\nbrilliant and scholarly a man as John Hay.  He will go down in\r\nhistory as among the greatest of our Secretaries of State.\r\n\r\nI will make some further references to the important results of\r\nthe Roosevelt Administration in what I shall say in a later chapter\r\nconcerning the work of the Committee on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\nWilliam Howard Taft, now President of the United States, was\r\nPresident Roosevelt's Secretary of War, and a very able Secretary\r\nhe was.  I first knew him in Washington when, as a young man but\r\nthirty-three years of age, he was serving as Solicitor General\r\nunder President Harrison.  I followed his career very closely from\r\nthe time that I first became acquainted with him.\r\n\r\nAs a United States Circuit Judge, to which position he was appointed\r\nby President Harrison, he was regarded as one of the ablest in the\r\ncountry.  The Circuit Court of Appeals on which he served was a\r\nnotable one.  It was composed of three men who have since occupied\r\nthe highest positions in the United States.  William R. Day was\r\nfirst Assistant Secretary of State, then Secretary of State, one\r\nof the negotiators of the Paris Peace Treaty, Circuit Judge, and\r\nlater a Supreme Court Justice.  Judge Taft was first civil Governor\r\nof the Philippines, Secretary of War, and then President; and he\r\nhas only recently appointed his old colleague, Judge Lurton, the\r\nthird member of the Court of Appeals, to the position of Justice\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nJudge Taft has occupied many high positions, all of which he has\r\nfilled with great honor and distinction.  I doubt whether he has\r\nenjoyed the high office of President of the United States.  I myself\r\nhave always thought that he would have made one of our greatest\r\nChief Justices had he been appointed to that position.\r\n\r\nJust before the National Convention of 1908 assembled at Chicago,\r\nin which convention I was chairman of the Illinois delegation, when\r\nevery one knew that Taft was sure to be the nominee, I called on\r\nhim at the War Department, and in the course of the conversation\r\nI took occasion to remark that I had always been in favor of him\r\nfor Chief Justice, but it seemed now that he was certain to be the\r\nnominee for President, and his career would consequently go along\r\nanother line.  He replied:  \"If your friend Chief Justice Fuller\r\nshould retire and the President should send me a commission as\r\nChief Justice, I would take it now.\"\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to practically close these memoirs with the end\r\nof the Roosevelt Administration, for the reason that I do not feel\r\nat liberty to write in detail of events occurring within the past\r\ntwo years.  All that I will venture to say is that my relations\r\nwith Mr. Taft as President have been of the most cordial and friendly\r\ncharacter; and no one can question that he has been thoroughly\r\nconscientious in the discharge of the duties of President of the\r\nUnited States.  That in 1910 the party went down in defeat for the\r\nfirst time in eighteen years cannot be charged to President Taft.\r\nNothing that he did as Chief Executive was responsible for that\r\ndefeat.  I myself believe that it was simply the result of the\r\npeople becoming tired of too much prosperity under Republican\r\nadministration.  The newspaper agitation over the Aldrich-Payne\r\nTariff Bill was mainly instrumental in turning the House of\r\nRepresentatives over to the Democracy.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Philander C. Knox was Attorney-General in President\r\nRoosevelt's cabinet, as he had been in the cabinet of his predecessor.\r\nHe is now serving as Secretary of State under President Taft.  He\r\nhas had a long and highly distinguished career at the bar, and is\r\nprobably one of the greatest lawyers of his day.  He served in the\r\nSenate of the United States for some years, and upon entering that\r\nbody he at once took his place as a leader on all questions of a\r\nlegal and constitutional nature.  As a member of the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, he had quite a commanding influence on important\r\nlegislation coming from that committee.  As Secretary of State Mr.\r\nKnox has been successful to an eminent degree, and I have no doubt\r\nthat his career as the Premier of the Taft Administration will add\r\nto his great fame as a lawyer and statesman.\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from saying a word in reference to the Hon. James\r\nWilson, who was appointed Secretary of Agriculture by President\r\nMcKinley, in which position he has been retained by both President\r\nRoosevelt and President Taft.  He has served as a cabinet officer\r\nfor a longer consecutive term than any man in our history.\r\n\r\nI have been more or less familiar with the administration of the\r\nAgricultural Department ever since its creation, and I do not\r\nhesitate to say that Mr. Wilson has been the most efficient Secretary\r\nof Agriculture that we have ever had.  He has accomplished greater\r\nresults in that office than any of his predecessors, and should\r\nremain there as long as he will consent to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE\r\n\r\nAt the time I am writing these lines, no question of governmental\r\npolicy occupies so prominent a place in the thoughts of the people\r\nas that of controlling the steady growth and extending influence\r\nof corporate power, and of regulating its relations to the public.\r\nAnd there are no corporations whose proceedings so directly affect\r\nevery citizen in the daily pursuit of his business as the corporations\r\nengaged in transportation.\r\n\r\nOf the many new forms introduced into every department of civilized\r\nlife during the past century, none have brought about more marvellous\r\nchanges than the railroad, as an instrumentality of commerce.  The\r\nsubstitution of steam and electricity for animal power was one of\r\nthe most important events in our industrial history.  The commercial,\r\nsocial, and political relations of the nations, have been revolutionized\r\nby the development of improved means of communication and\r\ntransportation.  With this changed condition of affairs in the\r\ncommercial world came new questions of the greatest importance for\r\nthe consideration of those upon whom devolved the duty of making\r\nthe nation's laws.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of railroads, the question was not how to regulate,\r\nbut how to secure them; but in the early seventies their importance\r\ngrew to such proportions that the railroads threatened to become\r\nthe masters and not the servants of the people.  There were all\r\nsorts of abuses.  Railroad officers became so arrogant that they\r\nseemed to assume that they were above all law; rebating and\r\ndiscrimination were the rule and not the exception.  It was the\r\npublic indignation against long continued discrimination and undue\r\npreferences which brought about the Granger Movement, which resulted,\r\nseventeen years later, in the enactment of the first Interstate\r\nCommerce Act.\r\n\r\nWith the Granger Movement of the early seventies, and the passage\r\nof State laws for the control of railroad transportation, began\r\nthe discussion which is still before Congress and the public as\r\none of the live issues of the day.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that I have been intimately connected with this\r\nsubject from the time I was serving as Speaker of the Illinois\r\nHouse of Representatives in 1873.\r\n\r\nThe State of Illinois, like most of the Western States, had a law\r\non the subject of railroad regulation; but it was ineffective, and\r\nthe commission under it had no practical power.  I appointed the\r\ncommittee of the House of Representatives of the Illinois Legislature\r\nin 1873, of which John Oberly, of Cairo, Illinois, was a member,\r\nand it was that committee that reported to the House the bill which\r\nfinally became a law, known as the Railroad and Warehouse Law of\r\n1873.  It is still the existing law in Illinois, and was for many\r\nyears regarded as one of the broadest and most far-reaching of\r\nState enactments.\r\n\r\nAfter I became Governor of the State, in 1877, I appointed a new\r\nRailroad and Warehouse Commission under the new law, and naturally\r\ntook a deep interest in its work.  During my term as Governor a\r\nresolution was adopted by the General Assembly really looking to\r\nthe abolition of the Railroad and Warehouse Commission, but on its\r\nface inquiring of me as Governor for information concerning the\r\ncost of maintaining the Railroad and Warehouse Commission, and the\r\nbenefits, if any, of the commission, to the people of the State of\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nTo this resolution I promptly responded in a message to the General\r\nAssembly, dated February 17, 1879, which in part I take the liberty\r\nof quoting here, because never afterwards in Illinois, so far as\r\nI know, was there any movement to abolish the Railroad and Warehouse\r\nCommission and repeal the Illinois Railroad and Warehouse Act.\r\n\r\nAfter giving the pay and expenses of the board, I continued:\r\n\r\n\"To answer this portion of the resolution in a manner satisfactory\r\nto myself would include a recital of the many attempts that have\r\nbeen made in this and other countries to control railroad corporations\r\nby legislation.  In a paper of this kind such a reply can not be\r\nmade.  I must therefore be satisfied with a glance at the advance\r\nthat resulted in the enactment of the railroad and warehouse laws\r\nof this State.\r\n\r\n\"Since the passage of the laws creating the railroad and warehouse\r\ncommission, in 1871, Illinois has made very important advances\r\ntoward the solution of the railroad problem.\r\n\r\n\"The questions involved in this problem have not only been before\r\nthe people of this State, but in other States and countries.\r\n\r\n\"In England, after the railroad had become a fact, it was recognized\r\nas a public highway.  The right of Parliament to fix rates for the\r\ntransportation of passengers and freight by railroad corporations\r\nwas therefore asserted, and schedules of rates were put into their\r\ncharters.  Those familiar with the subject need not be told that\r\nthe attempt to establish rates in this manner was a failure.  Then\r\nit was asserted that competition, if encouraged by the Government,\r\nwould prove a remedy for the abuses with which the railroads were\r\ncharged.  The suggestion was acted upon.  The Government encouraged\r\nthe construction of competing lines.  As a result, rates fell.\r\nCompetition, however, finally began to entail disaster upon the\r\ncompetitors and compel them to become allies to escape destruction.\r\nThe competitors combined; railroads were consolidated; rival lines\r\nwere united, and competition was thus destroyed.  The danger of\r\ngreat combinations of this kind, not only to the business interests\r\nof the country, but also to the State, was at once suggested, and\r\noccasioned alarm.  This alarm resulted in a public opinion that\r\nthe Government should own the railroads.  But consolidation, to\r\nthe surprise of the prophets of evil, did not result in higher\r\nrates.  On the contrary, lower rates and higher dividends resulted.\r\n\r\n\"Thus by a logical process of attempt and failure to control railroad\r\ncorporations, the conclusion was reached that wise policy required\r\npermission to such corporations to operate their railroads in their\r\nown way upon ordinary business principles.  But at the same time\r\na board of commissioners was wisely created and authorized to hear\r\nand determine complaints against railroad corporations, and to\r\nexercise other important powers.  This board was created about five\r\nyears ago; and the most notable feature in its career, says Charles\r\nFrancis Adams, junior, is the very trifling call that seems to have\r\nbeen made upon it.  The cases which come before it are neither\r\nnumerous nor of great importance.  It would, however, be unwholly\r\nsafe to conclude from this fact that such a tribunal is unnecessary.\r\nOn the contrary, it may be confidently asserted that no competent\r\nboard of railroad commissioners clothed with the peculiar power of\r\nthe English board, will, either there or anywhere else, have many\r\ncases to dispose of.  The mere fact that a tribunal is there, that\r\na machinery does exist for the prompt and final decision of that\r\nclass of questions put an end to them.  They no longer arise.\r\n\r\n\"The process through which the public mind in America has passed\r\non the railroad question is not dissimilar to that through which\r\nthe public mind of England passed.  But here competition was relied\r\non from the first.  To all who asked for them railroad charters\r\nwere granted.  The result has been the construction of railroads\r\nin all parts of the country, many of them through districts of\r\ncountry without business, or even population, as well as between\r\nall business centres and through populous, fertile, and well\r\ncultivated regions.  Free trade in railroad building, and the too\r\nliberal use of municipal credit in their aid, has induced the\r\nbuilding of some lines which are wholly unnecessary, and which\r\ncrowd, duplicate, and embarrass lines previously built and which\r\nwere fully adequate to the needs of the community.\r\n\r\n\"In Illinois, railroad enterprises have been particularly numerous\r\nand have made the State renowned for having the most miles of\r\nrailroad track--for being the chief railroad State.\r\n\r\n\"But competition did not result according to public anticipation.\r\nThe competing corporations worked without sufficient remuneration\r\nat competing points, and, to make good the losses resulting, were\r\noften guilty of extortion at the non-competing points.  They\r\ndiscriminated against persons and places.  Citizens protested\r\nagainst these abuses in vain.  The railroad corporations, when\r\nthreatened with the power of the Government, indulged in the language\r\nof defiance, and attempted to control legislation to their own\r\nadvantage.  At last public indignation became excited against them.\r\nThey did not heed it.  They believed the courts would be their\r\nrefuge from popular fury.  The indignation of the people expressed\r\nitself in many ways and finally found utterance in the Constitution\r\nof 1870.  In this Constitution may be found all the phases of\r\nopinion on the railroad question through which the English mind\r\nhas run.  The railroad is declared a public highway.  The establishment\r\nof reasonable rates of charges is directed; competition between\r\nrailroads is recognized as necessary to the public welfare; and\r\nthe General Assembly is required to pass laws to correct abuses\r\nand to prevent unjust discrimination and extortion in the rates\r\nand passenger tariffs on the different railroads of the State, and\r\nenforce such laws by adequate penalties to the extent, if necessary\r\nfor that purpose, of forfeiture of their property and franchises.\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution did more than this.  To correct abuses of the\r\ninterests of the farmers from whose fields warehousemen in combination\r\nwith corporate common carriers had been drawing riches, it declared\r\nall elevators or structures where grain or other property was stored\r\nfor a compensation, public warehouses, and expressly directed the\r\nGeneral Assembly to pass laws for the government of warehouses,\r\nfor the inspection of grain, and for the protection of producers,\r\nshippers, and receivers of grain and produce.\r\n\r\n\"Promptly after the adoption of the Constitution the Legislature\r\nattempted to give these provisions vitality by the enactment of\r\nlaws to carry them out.  One of these created the Railroad and\r\nWarehouse Commission and imposed on it important duties.  Another\r\nwas an act to regulate public warehouses and warehousing.  By this\r\nact other important duties were imposed upon the Railroad and\r\nWarehouse Commission.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the attempt to enforce these laws the message\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n\"In 1873, the present law to prevent extortion and unjust discrimination\r\nin rates charged for the transportation of passengers and freight\r\non railroads in this State was passed.  It was prepared and enacted\r\nwith the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of _Illinois_\r\nvs. _C. and A. R. R._, fresh in the minds of the members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and every suggestion made by the court was\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\"The Commission since the enactment of this statute has brought\r\nmany suits against railroad corporations for violation of the law.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the various cases I proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"In 1871, the Railroad and Warehouse Commission was established.\r\nIts creation was resisted by both railroad corporations and public\r\nwarehousemen, and after its organization they treated it with little\r\nconsideration.  They refused to recognize its authority, but after\r\nthe decision of the Supreme Court of the United States declaring\r\nthe doctrine that the Government may regulate the conduct of its\r\ncitizens to each other, and, when necessary, for the public good,\r\nthe manner in which each shall use his own property, the railroad\r\ncorporations and public warehousemen began to grow less determined\r\nin their opposition to the attempts to control them, until at this\r\ntime there is very little opposition.  They now give prompt attention\r\nto requests of the Commission for the correction of abuses called\r\nto its notice by their patrons; and thus the Commissioners not only\r\nsettle questions arising between railroad corporations and those\r\nwho patronize them, but it may as truthfully be said of this as of\r\nthe English or Massachusetts Commission, that the very fact of its\r\nexistence has put an end to many of the abuses formerly practised\r\nby such corporations, and which were angrily complained of by the\r\npeople. . . .\r\n\r\n\"It is a curious fact that the conclusion reached by the English\r\nstatesmen in 1874, was reached in Illinois in 1873; the conclusion\r\nthat railroad companies ought to have the right to control their\r\nown affairs, fix their own rates of transportation, be free from\r\nmeddlesome legislation, and, as has been said, work out their own\r\ndestiny in their own way, just so long as they show a reasonable\r\nregard for the requirements of the community.\"\r\n\r\nAfter analyzing the law of 1873, referring to the procedure under\r\nit, to the decision of the courts, and the fact that the Railroad\r\nand Warehouse Commissioners made under it a schedule of maximum\r\nrates of charges, I said:\r\n\r\n\"The schedule will require revision from time to time, and this\r\nwork can only be done by men who can give it their whole time, and\r\nwho will become students of the great subject of transportation.\r\n\r\n\"Before action by the Supreme Court it has not been deemed advisable\r\nthat the Commissioners should revise the schedule, and put the\r\nState thereby to what might be unnecessary expense; nor that they\r\nshould multiply suits under the law of 1873, against railroad\r\ncompanies for similar offences to those set up in the cases now\r\npending.\r\n\r\n\"Ever since its organization the board has been putting into\r\noperation new laws founded upon old principles applied to new facts\r\nand it has been compelled to walk with slow step.  It has been\r\nrequired, in the assertion of its authority to go from one court\r\nto another, and await the approval by the Supreme Court of the\r\nlegislation directed by the Constitution of 1870.\r\n\r\n\"It has won a victory in the warehouse controversy and secured the\r\njudicial endorsement of doctrines which in this age of concentration\r\nand monopoly, are absolutely necessary to the public welfare. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Leaving out of view the benefits that have resulted to the people\r\nby the mere fact of the existence of the Board, which has prevented\r\nmany abuses that would have been committed save for its presence\r\nin the State, it has been at work, and useful.  It has perfected\r\nthe organization of the Grain Inspection Department at Chicago; it\r\nhas gathered statistics in reference to transportation that are of\r\nvery great benefit to the public; it has adopted the policy of\r\nrailroad examinations with a view to security of life; and, in my\r\njudgment, the authority of the Commission ought to be enlarged so\r\nas to enable it to compel the railroad companies to improve their\r\ntracks and bridges, when, in the judgment of the Commission, such\r\nportions of railroads become unsafe.  The Railroad Commissioners\r\nact as arbitrators between the railroad companies and their patrons;\r\nand in the Commissioners' report they say they have succeeded in\r\nsettling most of the complaints made to them in a manner satisfactory\r\nto all the parties to the controversies.\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment if the Commission were dispensed with by the\r\nLegislature, difficulties would soon arise, agitation would commence\r\nagain, and controversies would run riot.  New legislation would\r\nfollow, another board of some kind would soon be created, and the\r\ntrack we have just passed over would be again travelled by the\r\npeople's representatives.\r\n\r\n\"The Board should be sustained in the interest of all the people.\r\nInstead of being destroyed it should be strengthened.  It should\r\nnot only have the authority with which it is now vested, but more.\r\nIt should be made a legal arbitrator in all matters of controversy\r\nbetween railroad companies and warehouses and their patrons; and\r\nit should be required to make examination of roads, and be invested\r\nwith authority to compel reparation of unsafe and defective bridges,\r\nculverts, track, and rolling-stock.\r\n\r\n  \"(Signed) S. M. Cullom,\r\n  \"Governor.\"\r\n\r\nMy experience, as Chief Executive of the State, with the practical\r\nworkings of the Railroad and Warehouse Law, clearly demonstrated\r\nto me that a State statute, no matter how drastic it might be, was\r\nutterly inadequate to meet the evils complained of, and that\r\neffective regulation must be Federal and not State, or probably\r\nFederal and State combined.  Some of the States had attempted to\r\nexercise control over interstate traffic which originated in the\r\nState, but it seemed perfectly clear from a long line of decisions\r\nof the Supreme Court, beginning with _Gibbons_ vs. _Ogden_, and\r\ncontinuing with _Reading Railway_ vs. _Pennsylvania; Baltimore and\r\nOhio_ vs. _Maryland_, and many other cases, that the States as such\r\nhad no control over interstate commerce.  But it was not until our\r\nown Illinois case (_Wabash Railroad_ vs. _Illinois_), that the\r\nSupreme Court settled it once and for all.  It was clearly stated\r\nin that case that the power of Congress was exclusive, and the\r\nCourt said that, \"notwithstanding whatever _dicta_ might appear in\r\nother cases, this court holds now and has never consciously held\r\notherwise, that a statute of a State intended to regulate or tax\r\nor to impose any restriction upon the transmission of persons or\r\nproperty from one State to another is not within the class of\r\nlegislation which the States may enact in the absence of legislation\r\nby Congress, and that such statutes are void.\"\r\n\r\nThis decision of the Supreme Court was rendered just about the time\r\nI was elected to the United States Senate, and I then and there\r\ndetermined that I would make it one of my great aims in the Senate\r\nto secure the enactment of a Federal statute regulating interstate\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nIt would seem astonishing that the Commerce clause of the Constitution\r\nshould have remained dormant, as it did for nearly a century.\r\nAside from two unimportant acts, no statute had been passed under\r\nit from the beginning of the Government until the Act to Regulate\r\nCommerce was passed in 1887.\r\n\r\nNot even a serious attempt had been made to pass an act for the\r\nregulation of interstate commerce.  Bills were introduced from\r\nCongress to Congress and laid aside; some investigations were made\r\n--as, for instance, the Windom investigation by a select committee\r\nof the House in 1873--but it all came to naught.  It seemed that\r\nno one man, either in the Senate or House, had made it his business\r\nto secure the passage of such an act.\r\n\r\nVery fortunately, as I see it now, when I first came to the Senate,\r\nI received no important committee assignments.  Having been in\r\npublic life for many years, member of Congress, Governor of my\r\nState, I naturally felt that I would be properly taken care of\r\nwithout appealing to my older colleagues for assistance.  Even my\r\nown colleague, General Logan, did not interest himself in the\r\nmatter.  I attended the caucus when the committee announcements\r\nwere made, and observing that I received nothing of any consequence,\r\nI addressed the caucus and protested that I had not been treated\r\nproperly.  Later Senator Edmunds resigned his place as a regent of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution and I was appointed to succeed him in\r\nthat position.\r\n\r\nI was assigned, however, to the Committee on Railroads--which was\r\nthen what we know now in the Senate as a non-working committee.\r\nI determined that the committee should have something to do, and\r\nI immediately became active in securing the consideration of an\r\nact for the regulation of interstate commerce.  I drew up a bill,\r\nintroduced it, had it referred to the committee, and finally secured\r\nits consideration and report to the Senate.  No one paid any\r\nparticular attention to what I was doing until then.  When the bill\r\nwas reported to the Senate, and I was pushing and urging and doing\r\neverything in my power to secure its consideration, Senator Allison,\r\nalways my friend, always wanting to assist me in any way in his\r\npower, came to me one day and said:\r\n\r\n\"Cullom, we know nothing about this question; we are groping in\r\nthe dark; and I believe that there ought to be a select committee\r\nof the Senate appointed to investigate the question, to go out\r\namong the people, take testimony, and find out what they know about\r\nit,--what the experts know, what the railroad officials know, what\r\npublic opinion generally is, and report their conclusions to the\r\nSenate at the beginning of the next session.  I am willing to help\r\nyou secure the passage of a resolution with that end in view.\"\r\n\r\nThis was perfectly agreeable to me and, on March 17, 1885, a\r\nresolution of the Senate, introduced by me, was adopted.  This\r\nresolution provided--\r\n\r\n\"That a select committee of five Senators be appointed to investigate\r\nand report upon the subject of the regulation of the transportation\r\nby railroad and water routes in connection or in competition with\r\nsaid railroads of freights and passengers between the several\r\nStates, with authority to sit during the recess of Congress, and\r\nwith power to summon witnesses, and to do whatever is necessary\r\nfor a full examination of the subject, and report to the Senate on\r\nor before the second Monday in December next.  Said committee shall\r\nhave power to appoint a clerk and stenographer, and the expenses\r\nof such investigation shall be paid from the appropriation for\r\nexpenses of inquiries and investigations ordered by the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee, of which I was made chairman, was appointed in due\r\ncourse, my colleagues being Senator O. H. Platt, of Connecticut;\r\nSenator Warner Miller, of New York; Senator Arthur Pugh Gorman, of\r\nMaryland; and Senator Isham G. Harris, of Tennessee.  Leaving out\r\nany reference to myself, the selection was regarded as having been\r\nmost judicious and suitable.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me digress to say a few words in reference to my\r\ncolleagues on that committee.\r\n\r\nSenator Warner Miller was a strong man intellectually, and a good\r\nbusiness man.  He had succeeded Senator T. C. Platt on March 4,\r\n1881, and readily took his place in the Senate as one of its\r\ninfluential members, although he served but one term.  He was a\r\nvaluable man as a member of the committee, and took a very prominent\r\npart in the debates preceding the passage of the act.\r\n\r\nSenator Gorman had a remarkable public career.  Without the advantages\r\nof influential family, without wealth, with only limited education,\r\nthrough his own exertions alone he arose from the position of a\r\npage in the United States Senate to the position of Senator and\r\nleader of his party in the Senate.  He was a _protégé_, friend,\r\nand follower of that illustrious son of Illinois, Stephen A. Douglas.\r\nHe was one of the most sagacious politicians of his day.  By his\r\nshrewd management of the Cleveland campaign he secured the defeat\r\nof Mr. Blaine and the election of Mr. Cleveland.  His charming\r\npersonality, his suavity of manner, his magnetic influence over\r\nmen with whom he came into contact, combined with his marked ability,\r\nmade it easy for him to retain the difficult position of a leader\r\nof his great party.  He enjoyed in the highest degree the respect\r\nand confidence of every Senator with whom he served, on both sides\r\nof the chamber, and specially was his influence felt in securing\r\nthe support of the Democratic Senators in the passage of the Act\r\nof 1887.\r\n\r\nSenator Harris, of Tennessee, was a very useful member of the\r\nSenate, and was a man possessed of more than ordinary ability.\r\nHis ability, perhaps, was not as great as Senator Gorman's, although\r\nhe was a very influential and highly respected member of the Senate.\r\nHe was a hard worker; and one trait in particular that I remember\r\nabout him was, he never failed to attend promptly on time the\r\nmeeting of any committee of which he was a member.  Indeed, I do\r\nnot know of any man with whom I have served in the Senate, aside\r\nfrom my respected colleague, Senator Frye, who was so punctual.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of convivial habits, and used to poke considerable\r\nfun at me because I would not drink or play poker.  At the time\r\nwhen the select committee was to meet in Memphis, the home of\r\nSenator Harris, the prominent business men of that place waited on\r\nhim and told him they understood a very eminent committee was coming\r\nthere in a few days, and they would like to show them some courtesies.\r\nHarris replied that he did not know who would be there; that Senator\r\nPlatt would not, and he did not believe Senator Gorman would--in\r\nfact, he did not believe any one would be there, excepting the\r\nchairman and himself; and so far as the chairman, Senator Cullom,\r\nwas concerned, they could not do anything for him, as he did not\r\ndrink or smoke, and was \"one of the damnedest, poorest card-players\r\nhe had ever known.\"  So, about all the entertaining they could do\r\nfor him would be to show him about the city.\r\n\r\nMany amusing stories were told of him.  When I called the committee\r\ntogether, preliminary to starting out on our tour, I told them that\r\nI would be very glad to allow them everything within reason that\r\nwas necessary, but the Government would not pay for their whiskey\r\nand cigars.  Harris promptly replied:  \"That's right, Mr. Chairman.\r\nSo far as I am concerned, if I can't get my whiskey by standing\r\naround the bar when other people are drinking, I will pay for it\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the committee were in Minneapolis, we were sitting at a long\r\ntable at dinner; I was at one end, and Harris was at the other,\r\nfacing me.  An old soldier came up to speak to me, and glancing\r\ndown toward the other end of the table, he asked:  \"Is n't that\r\nold Harris of Tennessee?\"  When I replied that it was, he continued:\r\n\"Well, well!  The last time I saw him, he was wearing a linen-\r\nduster, riding a mule, and going South like hell.\"\r\n\r\nHarris was a man of the most rigid honesty.  He not only rendered\r\nvaluable assistance in conducting the investigation, especially\r\nthrough the South, which section of the country he particularly\r\nrepresented, but took a prominent part in the debates and generally\r\nperformed his full share toward securing the passage of the act.\r\n\r\nOf Senator O. H. Platt I have already written.\r\n\r\nBut to return.  Immediately after the adjournment of Congress this\r\nselect committee visited Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Buffalo,\r\nDetroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Des Moines, Omaha, Minneapolis, and\r\nSt. Paul, where we adjourned to meet in the South.  We went to\r\nMemphis first, then to New Orleans and Atlanta, whence we returned\r\nto Washington, where I prepared the report of the committee which\r\nwas submitted to the Senate, January 18, 1886.\r\n\r\nThe committee began its work impressed with the importance of the\r\nduty with which it had been charged, and with each step taken in\r\nprosecuting the inquiry we realized more fully how heavy were the\r\nobstacles to be overcome, how serious were the abuses that existed,\r\nhow the public sentiment over the entire country was aroused, and\r\nhow difficult it was going to be to frame and secure the passage\r\nof a measure adequate to relieve the situation.  After many sessions\r\nand long conferences the select committee finally agreed upon a\r\nbill which, in its opinion, would correct the evils complained of.\r\n\r\nEven after the committee had agreed to the bill, I was not entirely\r\nsatisfied; I feared the existence of some absurdities, some features,\r\nwhich the railroads could not possibly comply with; and so I asked\r\nSenator Platt to meet me in New York, previously having arranged\r\nwith Mr. Fink and Mr. Blanchard, two of the great railroad men of\r\ntheir day, and a gentleman representing specially the people's\r\ninterests, whose name I do not recall, but who had been interested\r\nin securing regulation in New York and was an expert on the\r\nproposition, to meet with us in that city.  We all met as planned.\r\nI stated that I desired to take the bill up with them, section by\r\nsection, paragraph by paragraph, and if anything absurd or\r\nimpracticable was found, or anything that could not be carried out,\r\nattention should be called to it, and we would discuss it and amend\r\nit if necessary.  We went ahead on this line and were arguing over\r\nsome proposition, when Mr. Fink got up and remarked:  \"Let it go;\r\nthe whole thing is absurd anyhow.\"  I arose and said that if that\r\nwas the attitude of the railroad men, when the committee's only\r\nobject was to report to the Senate a fair bill, that the conference\r\nmight as well end.  The other members of the conference intervened\r\nand said it was not fair that the chairman of the committee should\r\nbe treated in this way, that Senator Cullom was acting in absolute\r\ngood faith, whereupon Mr. Fink apologized, and the reading was\r\nresumed, and some amendments made where found necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd this incident recalls to mind another aspect of the investigation.\r\nWhile the select committee was considering the subject, travelling\r\nfrom city to city, the high railroad officials paid no attention\r\nto us; rather, I might say, they avoided being called before us,\r\nprobably considering it a waste of time, as they had no serious\r\nthought that anything would come of the investigation.  They\r\nconsidered the railroads superior to the laws of Congress, and\r\ndepended upon their old State charters.  In those days they were\r\nthe most arrogant set of men in this country; they have since\r\nlearned that they are the servants and not the masters of the\r\npeople.  But when the bill seemed pretty certain to pass, the\r\nattitude of the railroad officials suddenly changed.  They came to\r\nWashington and complained that they had not been given the opportunity\r\nto be heard; that it would not be fair under the circumstances to\r\npass a bill so largely affecting them; and they seemed to be sorely\r\naggrieved when they could not prevent or delay its passage.\r\n\r\nI introduced the bill in the first session of the Forty-ninth\r\nCongress, and after a great deal of difficulty, even with my\r\ncolleague, General Logan, against it, finally had it made the\r\nspecial order.  General Logan knew nothing about the subject; he\r\ncared nothing about it, and on one occasion he told me that I would\r\nruin myself by advocating it.\r\n\r\nWhen I called the bill up for consideration, I was so anxious to\r\npress it along that I did not care to make any general speech,\r\nexcepting to explain as carefully and minutely as I could the\r\nvarious provisions of the measure.  I said, in opening:\r\n\r\n\"I believe I am justified in saying that there is no subject of a\r\npublic nature that is before the country about which there is so\r\ngreat unanimity of sentiment as there is upon the proposition that\r\nthe National Government ought in some way to regulate interstate\r\ncommerce.  The testimony taken by the Committee shows conclusively\r\nto my mind, and I think to every man's mind who reads it, that\r\nthere is necessity for some legislation by the National Government,\r\nlooking to the regulation of interstate commerce by railroad and\r\nby waterways in connection therewith.\r\n\r\n\"I believe the time has gone by when it is necessary for any one\r\nto take up the time of the Senate in discussing the proposition\r\nthat Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.  These\r\nquestions have been discussed over and over again in Congress, and\r\nthe highest judicial tribunals of the country have decided over\r\nand over again that Congress has the power to regulate commerce\r\namong the States.  So I do not feel at liberty, if I were disposed,\r\nto occupy the attention of the Senate in discussing the general\r\nsubject of whether there is any necessity for our doing anything,\r\nor the question of constitutional right of Congress to pass some\r\nact regulating commerce among the States.\r\n\r\n\"If the three propositions are correct:  that the public sentiment\r\nis substantially unanimous that we should act; that the necessity\r\nfor action exists; and that the power of Congress is admitted,--\r\nthe only question left is, what Congress ought to do specifically;\r\nin other words, what kind of an act should Congress pass.  The\r\ncommittee has reported a bill which is the best judgment that the\r\ncommittee had upon the subject.\"\r\n\r\nI then proceeded to explain the bill carefully, section by section,\r\nand concluded by saying:\r\n\r\n\"I am led to believe that the bill as it stands is perhaps a more\r\nperfect bill on this subject than has ever been introduced in the\r\nCongress of the United States before.  There may be many suggestions\r\nof amendment by honorable Senators during the consideration of the\r\nbill; and if any Senator has any suggestion of amendment to make,\r\nof course it is within the privilege of the Senate to adopt it,\r\nbut I am very anxious that this bill shall be as promptly considered\r\nas possible, and as promptly acted upon and passed as possible, if\r\nin the judgment of the Senate it ought to be passed at all.\r\n\r\n\"As the Senate know, this subject has been up for consideration\r\nfrom one term of Congress to another, almost time out of mind;\r\nuntil the people of the United States have come almost to believe\r\nthat there is no real purpose on the part of Congress to do anything\r\nmore than introduce and report bills and discuss them a while, and\r\nthen let them die before any final action is reached upon them.\r\n\r\n\"I said in the outset that in my judgment there is no public question\r\nbefore the American people to-day about which there is greater\r\nunanimity of sentiment than there is upon the proposition that the\r\nCongress of the United States ought to enact some law looking to\r\nthe regulation of commerce among the several States, and I trust\r\nwithout taking up the time of the Senate longer that every Senator\r\nwill give attention to this subject until we can pass some bill\r\nand get it to the other branch of Congress in the hope that before\r\nthis session adjourns we shall get some legislation on this subject\r\nthat will be of some service to the people and reasonably satisfy\r\npublic opinion.\"\r\n\r\nI pressed the bill on the attention of the Senate every day, never\r\nallowing it to be displaced where I could avoid it.  I was determined\r\nthat some bill should be passed at that session.  The debate was\r\nlong and interesting.  There were comparatively few set speeches.\r\nIt was a hot, running debate almost from the beginning, participated\r\nin by the strongest men in the Senate, many of whom were the ablest\r\nmen of their day.  Senators Aldrich, Edmunds, Evarts, Gorman, Hoar,\r\nIngalls, Manderson, Miller, Mitchell, Morrill, Platt, Sewell,\r\nSherman, Spooner, Teller, Vest, Morgan, Cameron, Dawes, Frye, Hale,\r\nHarrison, and Voorhees all engaged in it.\r\n\r\nThe bill was finally passed May 12, 1886.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Mr. Reagan, of Texas, who had been urging a bill\r\nin the House, and had it up for consideration during the same time\r\nthe Senate bill was being considered, passed his bill, which differed\r\nessentially from the Senate bill.  Both bills went to conference\r\ntogether, Mr. Reagan being the head of the conferees on the part\r\nof the House, and I being the head of the conferees on the part of\r\nthe Senate.  Then came the real struggle, the two measures remaining\r\nin conference from June to the following January.  The contention\r\nfinally centred on the pooling provision.  Reagan had yielded on\r\nnearly everything else; but Platt of Connecticut was bound there\r\nshould be no prohibition against pooling.  Reagan affirmed that\r\nthe whole matter would have to drop, that he would never yield on\r\nthat.  I came back and consulted the leaders in the Senate, Allison\r\namong others, and they advised me to yield; that the country demanded\r\na bill, and I had better accept Reagan's anti-pooling prohibition\r\nsection than offer no measure at all--which I did.\r\n\r\nWhether it is right or wrong, I do not know even to this day.  I\r\nhave never been quite certain in my mind on the question of pooling,\r\nand it is still a subject on which legislators and statesmen differ.\r\nBut one thing does seem certain--public sentiment is as much opposed\r\nto pooling to-day as it was twenty years ago.  There was a great\r\nfight in the Senate to secure the adoption of the conference report.\r\nIts adoption was opposed by such Senators as Cameron, Frye, Hawley,\r\nHoar, Morrill, Sawyer, Sewell, Sherman, and Spooner.  The pooling\r\nand long-and-short-haul clauses were the most fought over.  Senator\r\nPlatt, although a member of the conference, made a very able speech\r\non the subject of pooling, in which he showed considerable feeling,\r\nand I at one time feared that he would oppose the adoption of the\r\nconference report on that account altogether.  He concluded a very\r\nable address during the last days of the consideration of the\r\nreport, by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Nine-tenths of all the interstate commerce business done to-day\r\nis done under these arrangements which are sought to be damned\r\nbecause of the evil meaning which has been given to the word\r\n'pooling.'  Whatever stability has been given to the railroad\r\nbusiness, and through it to other business of the country, has been\r\nsecured by these traffic arrangements, and in my judgment a bill\r\nwhich breaks them all up ruthlessly within sixty days, which invites\r\nthe competition which is to demoralize business, will be far-reaching\r\nin its injurious results.  For one I prefer to stand by my judgment.\r\nI will try to have the courage of my convictions; I will try to do\r\nwhat I believe to be right, and I cannot consent to a bill which,\r\nthough I accept its other provisions, contains a provision which\r\nI regard as positively vicious and wrong.\"\r\n\r\nI was greatly provoked, almost outraged, at the manner in which\r\nSenators opposed the adoption of the conference report.  It became\r\nalmost a personal matter with me, and I finally concluded on the\r\nvery day the vote was to be taken, whether the adoption of the\r\nreport was to be beaten or not, that I would make a speech, and in\r\nthat speech I indicated just how I felt.  I said in part:\r\n\r\n\"I have been sitting here to-day listening to the assaults upon\r\nthis bill, until I have become almost convinced that I am the most\r\nvicious man toward the railroads of any man I know.  I started in\r\nupon the investigation of this subject two or three years ago with\r\nno prejudices, no bias of sentiment or judgment, no disposition\r\nwhatever to do anything except that which my deliberate judgment\r\ntold me was the best thing to do.  I have believed I have occupied\r\nthat position ever since, until within the last twenty-four hours,\r\nwhen the attacks upon this bill have become such that I have become\r\na little doubtful whether I have not been inspired from the beginning,\r\nso far as my action has been concerned, with a determination to\r\ndestroy the railroads of this country.  To listen to the Senator\r\nfrom Alabama [Mr. Morgan] descanting upon the provisions of the\r\nbill, one can scarcely resist the conclusion that it is a bill to\r\ndestroy the commerce of the country, and especially to break down\r\nall the railroads.\r\n\r\n\"So far as I am concerned, I repeat that I have no disposition of\r\nthat kind, and I am unaware that either of the Senators on the\r\nconference committee have had any such disposition.  We tried to\r\ndo the best we could with the bill the Senate passed during the\r\nlast session, to keep the bill as near to what the Senate had it\r\nas we could do, and to arrive at an agreement between the House\r\nand Senate conferees.\r\n\r\n\"I submit that the majority of the assaults have been against\r\nprovisions that were in the bill when the Senate voted for it during\r\nthe last session of Congress.  I am of the opinion that if this\r\ndiscussion lasted another day Senators would find in every line of\r\nthe bill a very serious objection to its adoption.  They started\r\nin to object to some provisions of the fourth and fifth sections.\r\nThe Senator who has just concluded his remarks got over to the\r\nthirteenth section and I believe went one or two sections beyond\r\nthat, and if there are any more speeches to be made against the\r\nbill I suppose the very last section of it will be attacked before\r\na vote is taken.\r\n\r\n\"The Senate conferees regarded it as their duty to cling to every\r\nportion of the Senate bill, as it was passed, that they could cling\r\nto and reach an agreement between the conferees of the House and\r\nSenate.  Hence it was that all these portions of the Senate bill\r\nnot objected to by the House conferees were allowed to remain in\r\nthe bill by the Senate conferees, the Senate conferees, as a matter\r\nof course, believing that the Senate of the United States knew what\r\nit was doing when it voted for the bill in the first place, and\r\nthinking that it remained of the same mind still. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Georgia assaults the bill because he says that\r\nunder it the provisions are so rigid that the railroads of the\r\ncountry can do no business at all.  The Senator from Oregon assaults\r\nthe bill because he says the fourth section amounts to nothing,\r\nand that the words 'under like circumstances and conditions' ought\r\nto be taken out.\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Hoar] assaults the bill because\r\nhe says it is going to interfere with foreign commerce, and that\r\nthe fourth section will be construed as not allowing a rebate of\r\nfive cents a hundred upon commerce shipped across the country for\r\nexportation. . . .\r\n\r\n\"So I might go on referring to every Senator who has spoken against\r\nthe bill, and nearly every one of them has founded his objections\r\nto the bill upon the use of the language that he had previously\r\nvoted for in the Senate of the United States before the bill went\r\nto conference at all.\"\r\n\r\nMen who opposed any legislation at all never supposed that the\r\nconference report would be agreed to, and I so stated in the Senate\r\nof the United States.  I pointed out, moreover, that when they were\r\nmet by a conference report the railroad men of the Senate rallied\r\nto the support of the transportation companies.  I continued:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it has just come to the point where you have got to face the\r\nmusic and vote for an interstate commerce bill, or vote it down.\r\nThat is all there is to it.  I have nothing more to say.  I have\r\ndischarged my duty as best I knew how.  I reported on the part of\r\nthe Senate conferees the bill that is before you.  I am not\r\nresponsible for what the Senate does with it.  I am not going to\r\nfind fault with anybody upon the question whether we concur in the\r\nreport or reject it, but I warn Senators that the people of the\r\nUnited States for the last ten years have been struggling to assert\r\nthe principle that the Government of the United States has the\r\npower to regulate transportation from one end of the country to\r\nanother.  I believe that if this report is rejected it is very\r\ndoubtful whether we shall get any legislation at all during this\r\npresent Congress, so when the Senate acts upon the question my duty\r\nwill have been done so far as I am able to see it.\r\n\r\n\"I have believed from the time I have given any attention to public\r\naffairs that it was necessary to bring into force the provisions\r\nof the Constitution giving Congress the power to regulate commerce\r\namong the States.  The Senator from New York [Mr. Evarts] attacked\r\nthe bill and said that it was unconstitutional because, as I\r\nunderstand it, the Constitution was framed for the purpose of\r\nfacilitating commerce, and this was a bill to hinder or to militate\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\n\"I undertake to say that the purpose of the bill, at least, whatever\r\nmay be the strained construction which has been placed upon it or\r\nwhich may be placed upon it by the transportation companies of the\r\ncountry, has been to facilitate commerce and to protect the individual\r\nrights of the people as against the great railroad corporations.\r\nI have no disposition to interfere with their legitimate business.\r\nI have no disposition, God knows, to interfere with the commerce\r\nof the country, properly conducted, but I do say that it is the\r\nduty of the Congress of the United States to place upon the statute\r\nbook some legislation which will look to the regulation of commerce\r\nupon the railroads that they will not treat one man differently\r\nunder similar circumstances and conditions. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Morgan] says that we had better go\r\nslow and remain quiet under the old regime.  Well, Mr. President,\r\nI remember only a few days ago hearing the Senator from Alabama\r\nalleging that the railroads, the common carriers of the country,\r\nwere eating up the people, were destroying the interests of the\r\npeople.  I do not know whether he confined his remark to his own\r\nState or extended it to the country, but I should have inferred\r\nfrom the language he used against the railroad companies that he\r\nwould have been in favor of almost any legislation that would in\r\nany way restrict them in their reckless disregard of the rights of\r\nthe people.  I can only conclude that the Senator from Alabama\r\nwould rather that destructive system should go on, as he charged\r\nit to exist when he made his speech the other day, without control,\r\nthan to trust a commission who he says are individually liable to\r\ncorrupt influences either at the hands of the President or somebody\r\nelse outside.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we have got to trust somebody.  We must either leave this\r\nmatter to the discretion and judgment and sense of honor of the\r\nofficers of the railroad companies, or we must trust the commission\r\nand the courts of the country to protect the people against unjust\r\ndiscrimination and extortion on the part of the common carriers.\r\nIs it the President of the United States as against a corporation?\r\nIs it an honest commission honestly selected by the President of\r\nthe United States as against a railroad company?  I say that there\r\nare not those inducements to be placed in the hands of a set of\r\nmen selected for their integrity, selected for their ability,\r\nselected for their capacity to regulate railroads and enforce the\r\nlaw, that are left in the hands of the officers of the railroad\r\ncompanies themselves.\r\n\r\n\"I take it that there is somebody honest in this country, and that\r\nthe President, if this bill becomes a law, will select the broadest\r\ngauge men, the men highest in integrity and intelligence as the\r\nmen to enforce this law as against the corporations and as a go-\r\nbetween, if you please, between the shippers and the railroads of\r\nthe country.  I am willing to trust them.  If they are not honest\r\nthe President has the right to remove them; and if the shipper is\r\nunwilling to submit to their judgment, under the bill he has a\r\nright to go directly to the courts.  I say that there is not anything\r\nthat can be done by these corporations against individuals where\r\nthe shipper himself has not a right to get into court in some way\r\nor other, if he is not willing to abide by the decision of the\r\ncommissioners appointed by the President.\"\r\n\r\nThe conference report was adopted by a vote of thirty-seven yeas\r\nto twelve nays; but it was a rather significant fact that there\r\nwere twenty-six absent, including Senators Aldrich, Dawes, Evarts,\r\nMorgan, and some of the most bitter opponents of railroad\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Act of 1887 are too well known to need any\r\nrecital here.  In a word, it was partly declaratory of the common\r\nlaw, its essential features being that railroad charges must be\r\nreasonable; that there must be no discriminations between persons\r\nand no preference between localities; railroads were prohibited\r\nfrom charging less for a long haul than for a shorter haul, \"included\r\nwithin it under substantially similar circumstances\"; pooling was\r\nprohibited; and a commission was established with power to hear\r\nand decide complaints, to make investigations and reports, and\r\ngenerally to see to the enforcement of the Act.\r\n\r\nConsidering the abuses that existed, the Act of 1887 was conservative\r\nlegislation, but in Congress and among the people generally it was\r\nconsidered radical, until the courts robbed it by judicial construction\r\nof much of its intended force.  During the debates, Senators remarked\r\nthat never in the history of governments was a bill under consideration\r\nwhich would inevitably affect directly or remotely so great financial\r\nand industrial interests.  It marked the beginning of a new era in\r\nthe management of the railway business of the United States.  It\r\nwas the beginning of Governmental regulation which has finally\r\nculminated in the legislation of the Sixty-first Congress.  And it\r\nis no little satisfaction to me to say that the fundamental principles\r\nof the original Act of 1887 have been retained in all subsequent\r\nacts.  No one has seriously advocated that the fundamental principles\r\nof the Act of 1887 be changed, and subsequent legislation has been\r\nbuilt upon it.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the original Act of 1887, a permanent Interstate\r\nCommittee of the Senate, of which I had the honor to be chairman,\r\nand in which position I remained for many years, was created.  It\r\nwas a very active committee at first.  Necessarily, amendments were\r\nmade to the law, and the railroads generally observed the law in\r\ngood faith.  Even the long-and-short-haul clause was observed, as\r\nit was intended by Congress that it should be.  That is, the\r\nrailroads did not set up at first that competition would create a\r\ndissimilarity of conditions and circumstances so as to justify them\r\nin charging more for the short haul than for the long haul.  But\r\nit was not many years before the railroads attacked first one and\r\nthen another provision of the law, and they generally secured\r\nfavorable decisions from the courts.  I do not intend to go into\r\nthe details of these decisions, the last one being the decision in\r\nthe case which held that the Commission had no power to fix a future\r\nrate, because the act did not give it that express power.  My own\r\njudgment is, and was at the time, that the original act by implication\r\ndid give to the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to say\r\nafter complaint and hearing, and after a given rate had been declared\r\nto be unreasonable, what in that case would be a reasonable rate;\r\nbut the courts decided otherwise.  Immediately, I drew up and\r\nintroduced a bill, number 1439, of the Fifty-sixth Congress, and\r\nhad it referred to the Committee on Interstate Commerce.  This bill\r\ncontained provisions substantially the same as were contained in\r\nthe Hepburn Bill which passed the Senate in 1906.  And in addition\r\nit was designed to give effect to the provisions of the original\r\nact which had been nullified by judicial construction.  I worked\r\nmy hardest to secure a favorable report of this bill.  We had many\r\nhearings; but the Committee on Interstate Commerce, far from being\r\nin favor of favorably reporting the bill, were inclined to decline\r\nto allow me to report it to the Senate at all.  I insisted that I\r\nwould report it even though adversely, which I was finally permitted\r\nto do.  But when reported to the Senate I stated that I reported\r\nit adversely because a majority of the committee were against it,\r\nbut that I favored the bill personally, and would do what I could\r\nto secure its passage.  This was in the year 1899.\r\n\r\nIt was not until seven years later that public sentiment was aroused\r\nto such an extent that it was possible to secure the amendments to\r\nthe Act of 1887 which were embodied in Senate bill 1439.\r\n\r\nI think it is only justice to myself to say--and I say it with much\r\nregret--that there were two reasons why it was impossible to secure\r\nat that time the report and passage of Senate bill 1439.  First of\r\nall, the Executive did not manifest any special interest in securing\r\nadditional railroad regulation.  Secondly, the railroads themselves\r\nhad been very active in securing a change of the personnel of the\r\nCommittee on Interstate Commerce, and men had been elected to the\r\nSenate and placed on that committee whose sympathies were in favor\r\nof very conservative regulation, if any regulation at all.  The\r\nrailroads had firmly determined to stop any further railroad\r\nregulation.  And finally, in the make-up of the Committee, a majority\r\nof the Senators placed on the Committee on Interstate Commerce were\r\nmen whose sympathies were with the railroads.\r\n\r\nBut even with the personnel of the committee made up against me,\r\nI have thought that had the late President McKinley given me the\r\nactive support which he could have given, I could have secured, in\r\n1899, practically all the legislation that was secured six years\r\nlater.  It is only justice to ex-President Roosevelt to say that\r\nhad it not been for his earnest advocacy of railroad rate regulation\r\nthe Hepburn Bill would never have been passed.  With a chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Interstate Commerce well known for his conservatism\r\non the subject, with a majority of Republicans on the committee in\r\nsympathy with him, without the arousing of public sentiment by\r\nPresident Roosevelt, nothing would have been done.\r\n\r\nI continued to take an exceptionally active part in railroad\r\nregulation until I was placed at the head of the Foreign Relations\r\nCommittee of the Senate, and even afterwards I remained as the\r\nranking member, next to the Chairman, of the Committee on Interstate\r\nCommerce, where I was glad to further as best I could such measures\r\nas came before the Committee in the way of strengthening and giving\r\nforce to the original act.\r\n\r\nI consented very reluctantly to leave the chairmanship of the\r\nCommittee on Interstate Commerce, where I had served during all my\r\nterm in the Senate, and I do not believe I would have done so had\r\nit not been for the manner in which the committee was packed against\r\nme in the interest of non-action.  At the last it became so that\r\neven the simplest measures which affected the railroads in the\r\nslightest degree would receive adverse action or none at all.  I\r\nwas utterly disgusted, and on several occasions told prominent\r\nrailroad men that if they continued such methods the time would\r\nsurely come when the people would become so aroused that they would\r\nsee enacted the most drastic of railroad rate laws.\r\n\r\nI had much to do with the passage of the Hepburn Act of 1906.\r\nAfter President Roosevelt had repeatedly urged it in his messages\r\nto Congress, and privately brought influence to bear on Senators,\r\nit seemed pretty certain that public sentiment demanded that\r\npractically the amendments to the original act embodied in Senate\r\nbill 1439, to which I have already referred, would sooner or later\r\nhave to be enacted into law.  As usual, those opposed to such\r\nlegislation demanded that hearings be held, and the Committee on\r\nInterstate Commerce was authorized to sit during the recess of\r\nCongress and to hold hearings.  Many weeks were consumed in these\r\nhearings, and many volumes of testimony were taken.  I do not\r\nbelieve that I missed a session of the committee, and I tried as\r\nbest I could to bring forth from the numerous witnesses summoned\r\nbefore the committee evidence to assist in securing the passage of\r\nthe amendments to the original act, which I then thought necessary\r\nto perfect it.\r\n\r\nI had expected to render what assistance I could during the next\r\nsession, which convened in December, in framing the bill in committee\r\nand to assist in its passage in the Senate.  But very unfortunately,\r\njust at the beginning of the next session of Congress, when the\r\nhearings were all concluded and the committee was prepared to go\r\ninto executive session to consider the bill itself, I was taken\r\nill and compelled to spend a couple of months in Florida to recover\r\nmy health.  It may seem strange, but the fact is, that my absence\r\nexpedited the consideration of the bill by the committee and its\r\nreport to the Senate.  I had telegraphed and written my late\r\ncolleague, Senator Dolliver, to record me as voting for the favorable\r\nreport of the bill from the committee to the Senate.  It was expected\r\nthat the committee would have to hold many sessions to consider the\r\nnumerous amendments that had been offered.  Senator Dolliver, at\r\none of the first meetings of the committee called to consider the\r\nbill, read my telegram and letter asking to be voted in favor of\r\nreporting the bill.  Objection was made to recording me, and one\r\ndistinguished Senator raised the point respecting how I was to be\r\nrecorded on the question of amendments.  Considerable controversy,\r\nI understand, took place, and Senator Dolliver then moved to report\r\nthe bill to the Senate with the amendments already adopted in\r\ncommittee.  This closed the discussion in the committee; the vote\r\nwas taken, and the bill was ordered reported to the Senate, my vote\r\nbeing recorded in the affirmative; after which Senator Aldrich, in\r\norder to make it appear all the more ridiculous, moved that Senator\r\nTillman, a minority member of the committee, be authorized to report\r\nthe bill.  This motion prevailed; Senator Tillman did report it,\r\nand he had charge of its passage in the Senate.  So, as I have\r\nstated, my absence, through the controversy over counting my vote,\r\nreally expedited the bill through the committee.\r\n\r\nI returned to my seat in the Senate in February, while the bill\r\nwas being considered, and assisted as best I could through conferences\r\nwith President Roosevelt and members of the Senate in agreeing on\r\nsections of the bill which were in controversy, particularly the\r\ncourt review section.  I was also one of the conferees on the part\r\nof the Senate that finally settled the differences between the two\r\nHouses.\r\n\r\nIt was a very satisfactory bill, in the form in which it finally\r\nbecame a law.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\nJOHN MARSHALL HARLAN\r\n\r\nI have always admired Mr. Justice John Marshall Harlan, who has\r\nserved some thirty-five years as a member of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, and who for a time after the death of Chief\r\nJustice Fuller acted as Chief Justice of the United States.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Judge Allen, who had for many years been United\r\nStates District Judge for the Southern District of Illinois, it\r\nwas suggested that his portrait be placed in the court room of the\r\nUnited States Circuit and District Court at Springfield, Illinois.\r\nThe movement developed into the broader suggestion that portraits\r\nof other distinguished judges, who had presided over the United\r\nStates Court at Springfield, and also a portrait of Chief Justice\r\nMarshall, be procured and added to the collection.  The portraits\r\nof Judges John Marshall, Walter Q. Gresham, David Davis, Samuel H.\r\nTreat, Thomas Drummond, William J. Allen, John McLean, Nathaniel\r\nPope, and John Marshall Harlan were procured, and it was planned\r\nthat a suitable ceremony should take place in Springfield on June\r\n2, 1903.\r\n\r\nJudge Humphrey wrote me, telling me of the plans of the committee\r\nappointed by the Bar of the United States Court at Springfield,\r\nand asking me to say something concerning any one of these\r\ndistinguished judges whom I might designate, leaving the selection\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nI thought the matter over and determined that, inasmuch as I had\r\nknown Justice Harlan more or less intimately ever since I became\r\na member of the Senate, I should like to talk about him.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was quite a notable one.  Vice-President Fairbanks\r\ndelivered an address on Judge Gresham; Judge Kohlsaat, on Chief\r\nJustice Marshall; Lawrence Weldon, on David Davis; Judge Creighton,\r\non Samuel H. Treat; Mr. John W. Jewett, on Thomas Drummond; J. C.\r\nAllen, on W. J. Allen; Mr. Logan Hay, on John McLean; General Alfred\r\nOrendorff, on Nathaniel Pope; and the portraits were accepted in\r\nthe name of the Court at Springfield by the Hon. J. Otis Humphrey,\r\nthe District Judge.\r\n\r\nThere was a very distinguished gathering of lawyers, of Federal\r\nand State judges from Illinois and adjacent States, and of many\r\nmembers of the families of the deceased jurists.  Judges Kohlsaat,\r\nHumphrey, and Anderson occupied the bench.  The whole proceeding\r\nwas a very dignified and appropriate one.\r\n\r\nI cannot give a better estimate of my regard for Justice Harlan\r\nthan by quoting some extracts from the address I delivered on that\r\noccasion:\r\n\r\n\"The Supreme Court to-day is composed on nine eminent justices, of\r\none of whom I have been asked to speak; and I do believe that the\r\nJustice of whom I speak, in all that goes to make a noted and able\r\njurist, is second only to that learned Chief Justice, John Marshall,\r\nof whom Judge Kohlsaat has so interestingly spoken.\r\n\r\n\"I speak of John Marshall Harlan, who has been an honored member\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States for more than a quarter\r\nof a century.\r\n\r\n\"Justice Harlan from his youth was the architect of his own fortune;\r\nhe has been a man of remarkable individuality and force of character;\r\nhe impressed himself from boyhood upon the community in which he\r\nlived.  Before he reached his nineteenth year he was made Adjutant-\r\nGeneral of the State of Kentucky.  Like Lincoln, he performed the\r\nobligations of a citizen, both in private and official life, with\r\nzeal and faithfulness to duty. . . .\r\n\r\n\"When Justice Harlan was but a young man, slavery became the\r\nparamount issue of the day, and naturally being a staunch Union\r\nman, he took an active part in the discussion and struggles that\r\nbecame more or less bitter in his very early manhood.  He was one\r\nof the first to enlist and lead his regiment in the field in favor\r\nof the Union and was assigned a place in that division of the army\r\ncommanded by the gallant old soldier and patriot, General Thomas. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Justice Harlan's record as a soldier was a brilliant one.  Certain\r\npromotion and higher honors were assured him, and he was nominated\r\nby President Lincoln to the position of Brigadier-General; but the\r\nresponsibilities resulting from the death of his father compelled\r\nhim to abandon what was certain to have been a distinguished military\r\ncareer, and he reluctantly returned to Kentucky. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Following the struggle in arms came important reconstruction\r\nlegislation and important Constitutional amendments, necessitating\r\njudicial interpretations.  These grave questions of state gave\r\nopportunity for the development of great statesmen and judges.\r\n\r\n\"Great crises produce great men.  Justice Harlan was at home in\r\nthe thickest of the struggle, through the period of reconstruction,\r\nan able lawyer, an uncompromisingly bold man, asserting his position\r\nwithout fear or favor.  While many of the important judicial and\r\nConstitutional questions growing out of reconstruction legislation\r\nremained unsettled, Justice Harlan took his place on the Supreme\r\nBench, having been appointed by President Hayes in 1877, and an\r\nexamination of the decisions of the Court since that year will show\r\nthe prominent part he has taken in the disposition of these\r\nConstitutional questions.\r\n\r\n\"It has been said that there never was a very powerful character,\r\na truly masculine, commanding man, who was not made so by struggles\r\nwith great difficulties.  Daily observation and history prove the\r\ntruth of this statement.  Hence I believe that the rough-and-tumble\r\nexistence to which the majority of ambitious young men of our\r\ncountry are subjected, does much to prepare them for the higher\r\nduties of substantial, valuable citizenship.  The active life and\r\nearly struggles of Justice Harlan in his State have had their\r\ninfluence in making him the fearless jurist that he is.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after his appointment, Justice Harlan was assigned as the\r\nSupreme Justice for this circuit, and served here for eighteen\r\nyears.  Many of you present remember his visit to Springfield and\r\nhis holding court in this room.\r\n\r\n\"To be a member of the Federal Judiciary is the highest honor that\r\ncan be conferred upon an American lawyer.  The crowning glory of\r\nour Nation was the establishment, by the fathers, of the independent\r\nFederal Judiciary, which is the conservator of the Constitution.\r\nI have unbounded faith in it.  It is the protector of those\r\nfundamental liberties so dear to the Anglo-Saxon race.  State\r\nLegislatures and the Congress may be swayed by the heat and passion\r\nof the hour; but so long as our independent Federal Judiciary\r\nremains, our people are safe in their legal, fundamental, Constitutional\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps there is nothing that illustrates so well Justice Harlan's\r\ncharacter, the equality of all men before the law, as do some of\r\nhis dissenting opinions.\"\r\n\r\nI then referred to his famous dissent in the Civil Rights case,\r\ndelivered in 1883; to his dissent in the Income Tax case, and others\r\nof his notable utterances from the Supreme Bench; and at the same\r\ntime I referred to the fact that he had written more than seven\r\nhundred opinions, covering nearly every branch of the law, the\r\nopinions on Constitutional questions being unusually large.  I\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"In many respects Justice Harlan resembles his namesake, John\r\nMarshall.  Like John Marshall, he received his early training for\r\nthe bench in the active practice at the Bar.  Like John Marshall,\r\nhe enlisted and fought for his country.  Like John Marshall, while\r\nstill a young man, he was appointed a Justice of the Supreme Court,\r\nand has for more than a quarter of a century occupied that position.\r\nAnd like John Marshall, his great work on the bench has been in\r\ncases involving the construction and application of the Constitution.\r\nHe has been especially assigned by the Court to the writing of\r\nopinions on Constitutional Law.  In my opinion he stands to-day as\r\nthe greatest living Constitutional lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"If the Court please, I desire to refer to one more phase of Justice\r\nHarlan's character.  He is a religious man.  He does not parade\r\nhis belief before the world, yet he possesses deep and devout\r\nconvictions and has given deep study to church questions.  And it\r\nmay be said that the great men of the world from the earliest dawn\r\nof civilization, with but few exceptions, have believed that the\r\nlife of the soul does not end with the death of the body.  Cicero,\r\nlong before the birth of the Saviour, said:\r\n\r\n'When I consider the wonderful activity of the mind, so great a\r\nmemory of what has passed, and such a capacity of penetrating into\r\nthe future; when I behold such a number of arts and sciences, and\r\nsuch a multitude of discoveries thence arising, I believe and am\r\nfirmly persuaded that a nature which contains so many things within\r\nitself can not be mortal.'\r\n\r\n\"Centuries later the famous Dr. Johnson well said:  'How gloomy\r\nwould be the mansions of the dead to him who did not know that he\r\nshould never die; that what now acts shall continue its agency,\r\nand what now thinks shall think on for ever.'\r\n\r\n\"Justice Harlan is a firm and devout believer in the immortality\r\nof the soul.\r\n\r\n\"He is now approaching the age when under the law he may retire\r\nfrom the bench, yet he is in the vigor of health and is perhaps\r\nthe greater judge to-day than at any time in his past career.  I\r\nam sure I voice the general desire of the Bar of the whole country\r\nthat he shall, so long as his health and strength continue, remain\r\nan active member of that great Court.\"\r\n\r\nIt is more than eight years since I delivered that address.  In\r\nthe ensuing period, five justices of the Supreme Court have either\r\nretired under the law, or passed away, none of whom enjoyed a length\r\nof service equal to Judge Harlan's; and yet Justice Harlan is\r\nattending daily to his duties as a member of that court, apparently\r\nin vigorous health and certainly as profound and learned a judge\r\nto-day as at any time in his past career.  And I repeat now what\r\nI said eight years ago--that I hope he shall for years to come\r\nremain an active member of that great court.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\nMEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Charles Sumner considered the chairmanship\r\nof the Committee on Foreign Relations as the highest honor that\r\ncould have been conferred upon him by the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nI have been chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations for a\r\nlonger consecutive period than any man in our history, aside from\r\nMr. Sumner, who served as chairman for ten years.  If I continue\r\nas chairman during the remainder of my term, I shall have exceeded\r\nthe long service of Mr. Sumner.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Foreign Relations was among the first of the\r\npermanent standing committees of the Senate.  Prior to 1816, there\r\nwere no permanent standing committees, the custom being to appoint\r\nselect committees to consider the different portions of the\r\nPresident's messages, and for the consideration of any other subject\r\nwhich the Senate might from session to session determine necessary\r\nfor committee reference.  On December 13, 1816, the Senate, by\r\nrule, proceeded to the appointment of the following standing\r\ncommittees, agreeably to the resolution of the tenth instant, which\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, that it shall be one of the rules of the Senate that\r\nthe following standing committees be appointed at each session:\r\na Committee on Foreign Relations, a Committee on Finance, a Committee\r\non Commerce and Manufactures, a Committee on Military Affairs, a\r\nCommittee on the Militia, a Committee on Naval Affairs, a Committee\r\non Public Lands, a Committee on Claims, a Committee on the Judiciary,\r\na Committee on Post-offices and Post-roads, and a Committee on\r\nPensions.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that under this rule, the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations was named first, and Mr. Barbour, of Virginia, was its\r\nfirst chairman.  Whether it was at that time considered the most\r\nimportant committee, I do not know; but I do know that from the\r\ndate of its formation, the Committee on Foreign Relations has been\r\namong the most important committees of the Senate, and at times in\r\nour history it has been _the_ most important committee.  It has\r\nbeen from the beginning particularly noted for the high character\r\nof the men who composed its membership, and we find in the archives\r\nof the Senate the names of some of the greatest men in our national\r\nhistory, who have from time to time acted as its chairmen.\r\n\r\nBarbour of Virginia, Henry Clay, James Buchanan, Rives, Benton,\r\nKing, Cass, Sumner, Windom, John F. Miller, John T. Morgan, John\r\nSherman, and Cushman K. Davis are a few of those who have at\r\ndifferent times occupied the position of chairman of the Committee\r\non Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\nMy predecessors, as their names will indicate to those familiar\r\nwith American history, have been noted for their conservatism in\r\ndealing with matters pertaining to our foreign relations, and there\r\nis no position in the Senate where conservatism is so essential.\r\nMy ambition has been so to conduct the business coming before the\r\ncommittee as to keep up the high standard set and the high standing\r\nmaintained by the distinguished statesmen who have preceded me in\r\nthe position.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Foreign Relations Committee is almost exclusively\r\nexecutive and confidential, and consists largely in the consideration\r\nof treaties submitted by the President to the Senate for ratification.\r\nVery little important legislative business comes before this\r\ncommittee, although it has jurisdiction over claims of foreign\r\ncitizens against the United States, and all legislation that in\r\nany wise affects our relations with other nations.\r\n\r\nIt was almost, I might say, by accident that I became a member of\r\nthis important committee.  I had been a member of the Committee on\r\nCommerce for a number of years, and took quite an interest in the\r\nvery important legislation coming before that committee; and the\r\nimprovement of rivers and harbors was a subject in which Illinois\r\nwas greatly interested.\r\n\r\nThe late Senator Mitchell, of Oregon, was in 1895 chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Organization, having in charge the make-up of the\r\ncommittees of the Senate, and he wanted a place on the Committee\r\non Commerce for some Western Senator.  He came to me and explained\r\nhis embarrassment, and asked me if I would be willing to be\r\ntransferred from the Committee on Commerce to the Committee on\r\nForeign Relations.  I wanted to accommodate Senator Mitchell, and\r\nI told him that I would consent to be transferred, but at the same\r\ntime I was not at all anxious to leave the Committee on Commerce.\r\nThe transfer was made in due course, and I have served continuously\r\non the Foreign Relations Committee since that time, 1895.\r\n\r\nJohn Sherman was chairman of the committee when I became a member\r\nof it.  It was at a period when there were very few material foreign\r\nmatters to engage the attention of the Senate.  Sherman served as\r\nchairman of the committee, at different periods, for nearly ten\r\nyears.  He was a wise, conservative chairman; not especially\r\nbrilliant, as was Senator Davis, or Senator Sumner; but every one\r\nhad confidence in him and felt that in his hands nothing unwise or\r\nfoolish would emanate from the committee.\r\n\r\nI was chairman of the Committee on Interstate Commerce at that\r\ntime, and the work of that committee, added to the work devolving\r\nupon me as a member of the Committee on Appropriations, engrossed\r\nmost of my time; and while I regularly attended the meetings of\r\nthe Committee on Foreign Relations, I cannot say that I took a\r\nprominent part, or, indeed, a very deep interest, in it until I\r\nbecame its chairman, succeeding the late Cushman K. Davis in 1901.\r\n\r\nCushman K. Davis was a warm personal friend of mine.  As the years\r\npassed by and I grew to know him more and more intimately, I became\r\nmore deeply attached to him, and my respect for him as a statesman\r\nconstantly increased.  He was what I would term a specialist in\r\nlegislation.  He took little or no interest in any other subject\r\nthan matters pertaining to our foreign relations.  He was a prominent\r\nfigure in public affairs for many years.  A soldier in the Civil\r\nWar, serving in many prominent places in civil affairs in his State,\r\nincluding the position of Governor, he came to the Senate as a\r\nripened statesman.  He entered the Senate in 1887, and in 1891\r\nbecame a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and very early\r\nbecame one of its leading members.  Succeeding the late Senator\r\nSherman, in 1897, he became its chairman and served in that position\r\nuntil his death.  Few more scholarly or cultivated men have ever\r\noccupied a seat in the Senate.\r\n\r\nHe was a peculiar man in many respects, and did not court, or even\r\nencourage, the advice of his colleagues on the committee, or even\r\nof the Secretary of State.  I had served on the Committee on Foreign\r\nAffairs of the House when Mr. Seward was Secretary of State and I\r\nknew what a help it was to the committee to have the Secretary meet\r\nwith us personally and discuss matters of more or less importance.\r\nWe all listened to Secretary Seward with the profoundest respect\r\nand attention; but as I look back on it now, I think that Secretary\r\nSeward probably entertained more than he instructed the members.\r\nHe seemed to enjoy attending the sessions.\r\n\r\nI thought that it would be a help if we could have Mr. Olney, then\r\nSecretary of State, before us.  I suggested to Senator Davis at\r\none meeting, that Secretary Olney should be invited to come and\r\nexplain some question concerning which we seemed to be in doubt.\r\nSenator Davis declined to invite him, and said so in so many words.\r\nApparently he did not desire any interference or information from\r\nthe Executive Department.  I felt pretty free to express my opinion\r\nto Senator Davis, and I told him that inasmuch as he did not care\r\nto invite Secretary Olney, I would invite him myself, if he did\r\nnot object.  I did so, and Secretary Olney, at a subsequent meeting,\r\nmet with the committee and very quickly explained the question\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\nSenator Davis was a well recognized authority on international law,\r\nboth as a lecturer on that subject and a writer.  Judging from his\r\ndisplay of ability, he ought to have been able to write a monumental\r\nwork on the subject.  But he was an indolent man and contented\r\nhimself with publishing merely a little volume containing a _résumé_\r\nof his lectures before a Washington college of law.  The publication\r\nof this work detracted from, rather than added to, his reputation\r\nas a student and writer.\r\n\r\nHe was not an orator, but on occasions, in executive session, when\r\ngreat international questions were before the Senate, I have heard\r\nhim deliver wonderfully eloquent speeches.  He always commanded\r\nthe closest attention whenever he spoke in the Senate, whether in\r\nexecutive or open session (which latter he only infrequently did,\r\nby the way), and he always exhausted the subject.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley appointed him a member of the Paris Peace\r\nCommission to frame the treaty of peace with Spain.  How well he\r\nperformed that service those of his colleagues on the commission\r\nwho are still living, can attest.  He returned from Paris and had\r\ncharge of the ratification of the treaty in the Senate.\r\n\r\nI have always believed that Senator Davis's death was the result\r\nof his indolent habits.  I do not believe he ever took any physical\r\nexercise; at least he did not do so during the time that I knew\r\nhim.  He was so much of a student, and so interested in books, that\r\nhe seemed to think that time devoted to the proper care of his\r\nphysical condition was so much time wasted.  The result was that\r\nwhen disease attacked him he became an easy prey, and when he passed\r\naway it was said that he bore all the marks of a very old man, even\r\nthough he was comparatively young in years.  It was my sad duty,\r\nas a member of the United States Senate, to attend his funeral in\r\nSt. Paul, in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe northwest section of the United States has not now, and never\r\nhad before, as capable a scholar and statesman as Cushman K. Davis.\r\n\r\nI succeeded Senator Davis as chairman of the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations.  I have enjoyed my work on the committee more than I\r\nhave enjoyed any other work that I have done in the Senate.  There\r\nare a number of reasons for this.  First, the members of the\r\ncommittee, during my service, have been particularly able and\r\nagreeable men, and during those years some of the greatest men of\r\nthe Senate have been numbered among its members.  Aside from one,\r\nwhom I have long since forgiven, I do not recall now that I have\r\nhad a single controversy or unkind word with any member.  In\r\naddition, the work is not only of the greatest importance, but it\r\nhas been very satisfactory, because partisanship has not at all\r\nentered into the disposition of matters pertaining to our foreign\r\naffairs.  The members of the committee during my time have always\r\nseemed to take a deep interest in the work coming before them, and,\r\nunlike most of the committees of the Senate, it has never been\r\ndifficult to secure the attendance of a working quorum.  In the\r\nten years that I have been chairman, I do not believe the committee\r\nhas ever been compelled to adjourn for want of a quorum when any\r\nimportant business was before it.\r\n\r\nUntil his death in 1911, Senator Wm. P. Frye, of Maine, was in\r\npoint of service the oldest member of the committee.  He had served\r\nas one of its members ever since 1885.  He could have been chairman,\r\nby right of seniority, when Mr. Davis was made chairman in 1891,\r\non the retirement of Mr. Sherman; and again he could have become\r\nchairman when Senator Davis died.  He did act in that capacity for\r\nnearly a year, but he always seemed to prefer the chairmanship of\r\nthe Committee on Commerce.\r\n\r\nI believe that the late Senator Hanna had a good deal to do with\r\nSenator Frye's declining to succeed the late Senator Davis as\r\nchairman.  Ship-subsidy and the building up of the merchant marine\r\nof the United States were then before the Senate, and Senator Hanna,\r\na ship owner himself, was deeply interested in that legislation.\r\nSenator Hanna and Senator Frye were devoted friends; and, although\r\nI do not know, I have always felt that it was Senator Hanna who\r\ninduced Senator Frye to remain at the head of the Committee on\r\nCommerce.\r\n\r\nSenator Frye was a very capable and faithful Senator, and enjoyed\r\nthe confidence and respect of the people of his State to a greater\r\ndegree than any other Maine statesman, with the exception of Mr.\r\nBlaine.  As chairman of the Committee on Commerce, I would say he\r\ndominated that committee, and at the same time he was a most\r\nsatisfactory chairman to every Senator who served on it.  He was\r\nthoroughly familiar with every question pertaining to rivers and\r\nharbors, the shipping interests, and the multitude of matters coming\r\nbefore the committee.  Senator Burton, of Ohio, is probably the\r\nonly member of the United States Senate at present who is as well\r\nposted on matters before the Committee on Commerce.\r\n\r\nMr. Frye was an active member of the Committee on Foreign Relations,\r\nand during the brief periods when I have been compelled by reason\r\nof illness to remain away from the Senate I always designated\r\nSenator Frye to act in my stead.\r\n\r\nAmong his colleagues in the Senate, he enjoyed the greatest degree\r\nof popularity; and aside from one or two occasions when his own\r\ncolleague opposed him, no Senator ever objected to any ordinary\r\nbill which Senator Frye called up and asked to have placed on its\r\npassage.  In fact it was his custom to report a bill from his\r\ncommittee, or the Committee on Foreign Relations, the only two\r\nworking committees of which he was a member, and ask for its\r\nimmediate consideration.  No one ever objected, and the bill went\r\nthrough as a meritorious measure without question, on his word\r\nalone to the Senate.\r\n\r\nHe was an ideal presiding officer.  For years he was president _pro\r\ntempore_, and the death of Vice-President Hobart, and the accession\r\nof Mr. Roosevelt to the Presidency, necessitated his almost constant\r\noccupancy of the chair.  With the peculiar rules existing in the\r\nSenate, the position of presiding officer is comparatively an easy\r\none.  Senator Frye made an especially agreeable presiding officer,\r\nexpediting the business of the Senate in a degree equal to that of\r\nany presiding officer during my service.\r\n\r\nI recollect when he was elected president _pro tempore_, in 1896,\r\nI had been talked of for the place, but he had not heard that I\r\ndesired it; and a Republican caucus was held which named him\r\npresident.  Senator Chandler, for whom I have always had the greatest\r\nrespect as a man and as a Senator, after the caucus was held told\r\nSenator Frye that he had heard I had some ambition for the place.\r\nMr. Frye came at once to my house and to my study and asked me, in\r\nso many words, if I had desired to be president of the Senate.  I\r\nreplied that I had not, adding that I had had no particular concern\r\nabout it at any time.  He thereupon asserted that he had called\r\nsimply to apprise me that whenever I wanted the position he would\r\nvery cheerfully resign and yield it to me.  I assured him that if\r\nhe did not yield it until I asked him to do so, he would hold it\r\nfor a long time.  He never had any opposition, and on both sides\r\nof the chamber he was, as presiding officer, equally popular.  He\r\nvoluntarily relinquished the office at the beginning of the Sixty-\r\nsecond Congress.\r\n\r\nWhen the tariff was one of the issues--during the first Cleveland,\r\nthe Harrison, and the second Cleveland campaigns and to a lesser\r\ndegree in 1896 and 1900,--Senator Frye was regarded as one of the\r\nforemost orators and stump speakers on the tariff question.  During\r\nhis later years it was very much to be regretted that he did not\r\nfeel able to take an active part in national campaigns.\r\n\r\nThe news of Senator Frye's death comes to me while I am engaged in\r\nreading the proof of what I have said about him in this book.  He\r\ndied at four o'clock on the eighth day of August, 1911, passing\r\naway at the age of eighty-one years.  When asked by a newspaper\r\nman for a brief estimate of Mr. Frye's character, I said:  \"He was\r\nnot only one of the ablest and most devoted of public servants,\r\nbut one of the most charming men that I have ever known.\"  This\r\nexpression I desire to repeat here for perpetuation in endurable\r\nform.\r\n\r\nSeldom has this country commanded the services of a more enlightened\r\nor more self-sacrificing man than Mr. Frye.  He was patriotic to\r\nthe very heart's core; no sacrifice for the country would have been\r\ntoo great for him.  He, and his colleague Mr. Hale, and Senators\r\nAllison, of Iowa, Platt, of Connecticut, Teller, of Colorado,\r\nCockrell, of Missouri, Morgan, of Alabama, and Spooner, of Wisconsin,\r\nconstitute a coterie of public men of the last half century such\r\nas any nation should be proud of.  Unselfish, energetic, and\r\npatriotic, they have done much to keep the United States on the\r\nproper level.  Let us hope, as we must, that the public councils\r\nof the nation may always be guided by men of their character and\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\nSenator Frye's death leaves me the oldest member of the Senate in\r\npoint of service.  He entered the Senate in March, 1881, giving\r\nhim more than thirty years of service, while I entered in March,\r\n1883, which gives me more than twenty-eight years up to date.  It\r\nthus will be seen that we have served together for almost an average\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nSenator Jacob H. Gallinger of New Hampshire, who was promoted from\r\nthe House to the Senate in 1891, now becomes the second member of\r\nthe latter body in respect to length of service.  Mr. Gallinger is\r\nnot a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, of whose\r\nmembership I am now especially speaking, but it cannot be out of\r\nplace for me to pause here to give him a word of commendation and\r\nsalutation as I pursue my way through this maze of memory.  A\r\nphysician by profession, and a native of Canada, Mr. Gallinger has\r\nshown marked adaptability in taking on the American spirit and in\r\nperforming the public's service.  He has for many years been Chairman\r\nof the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia, which, possessing\r\nmany of the attributes of an ordinary city council, requires minute\r\nattention to detail.  Mr. Gallinger is the second member of the\r\nimportant Committee on Commerce, and one of the leading members of\r\nthe Committee on Appropriations.  His committee work therefore\r\ncovers a wide range of subjects.  Never has he been known to fail\r\nin the performance of his duties in all these connections.  Moreover,\r\nhe is a constant attendant upon the sessions of the Senate, and\r\none of the most alert of its members.  Apparently, often, he is\r\nimpulsive and explosive, and occasionally under the excitement of\r\ndebate says what seems to be a harsh thing.  If, however, his manner\r\nis indicative of feeling, such a feeling, like a passing summer\r\ncloud, is soon dissipated, and almost immediately gives way to the\r\nsunshine of his really genial and lovable nature.  Senator Gallinger\r\nas a member of the House and Senate has given the American public\r\nas much genuine and patriotic service as any man in public life\r\nduring the past quarter of a century.  I hope he may continue long\r\nto adorn the Senate.\r\n\r\nSenator John T. Morgan, of Alabama, was appointed a member of the\r\nForeign Relations Committee in 1879, and served continuously as a\r\nmember of it until his death in 1907, a total service of twenty-\r\neight years.  I do not know of any other Senator who served on that\r\ncommittee for so long a period.  When the Senate was in control of\r\nthe Democrats under the second Cleveland Administration, he was\r\nchairman of the committee.\r\n\r\nSenator Morgan was an extraordinary man in many respects.  He had\r\na wonderful fund of information on every subject, but was not a\r\nman of very sound judgment, and I could not say that he was a man\r\non whose advice one could rely in solving a difficult problem.  At\r\nthe same time, no one could doubt his honesty and sincerity of\r\npurpose.  He did not have the faculty of seeing both sides of a\r\nquestion, and once he made up his mind, it was impossible to change\r\nhim, or by argument and reason to move him from a position deliberately\r\ntaken.  I probably had as intimate an acquaintance with him as any\r\nother Senator enjoyed, for we not only served as colleagues on the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations, but, as I have stated in another\r\nchapter, we served together on the Hawaiian Commission.  He was\r\none of the most delightful and agreeable of men if you agreed with\r\nhim on any question, but he was so intense on any subject in which\r\nhe took an interest, particularly anything pertaining to the\r\ninteroceanic canal, that he became almost vicious toward any one\r\nwho opposed him.\r\n\r\nIf an Isthmian canal be finally constructed, Senator Morgan must\r\nbe accorded a large share of the credit; and his name will go down\r\nas the father of it, even though he himself affirmed in debate in\r\nthe Senate one day, after the Panama route had been selected, that\r\nhe would not be \"the father of such a bastard.\"  Senator Morgan\r\nfought for the Nicaraguan route with all the power at his command.\r\nHe fought the treaties with Colombia and Panama, first for many\r\nweeks in the committee, and then in the executive sessions of the\r\nSenate.  He wanted to arouse public sentiment against the Panama\r\nroute, and he addressed the Senate about five hours every day for\r\nthirteen days on the subject, desisting only when we consented to\r\npublish his speeches and papers on the subject, notwithstanding\r\nthey had been made and presented in executive session.  Nevertheless,\r\nit was Senator Morgan who for very many years kept the subject of\r\nan interoceanic canal before Congress and the country, and finally,\r\npartially through his efforts, interest in the project was kept\r\nalive until it was determined, first, that the canal should be\r\nconstructed; and second, that it should be over the Panama route.\r\nMany people thought that the selection of the Panama route would\r\nbreak Senator Morgan's heart; but they did not know him.  He made\r\nthe best fight he could, and when the Panama route was selected he\r\ntook the same deep interest in the legislation to carry the work\r\nforward that he had always taken in the possible alternative route.\r\nHe was firmly convinced that the canal, on account of certain\r\nphysical reasons, could never be constructed across the Isthmus of\r\nPanama.\r\n\r\nTime alone will tell whether or not Senator Morgan was right.  Time\r\nhas demonstrated that he was right in his contention that the Panama\r\nCanal could never be constructed for the amount estimated by the\r\nengineers, one hundred and eighty-three million dollars.  It has\r\nalready cost over two hundred million dollars, and it is not yet\r\nnearly completed.  The latest estimates are that it will cost over\r\nthree hundred and eighty-five million dollars.  How much more it\r\nwill cost the United States, no one can say.\r\n\r\nDuring the later years of his life, he was probably the most\r\ninteresting and unique figure in the Senate.  Toward the close of\r\nhis Senatorial career he became very feeble, but he attended to\r\nhis Senatorial duties as long as he was able to be about at all.\r\nThe last time I saw him alive was on the fourth of March, 1907,\r\nthe last day of the session, and the last time he ever entered the\r\nSenate or the Capitol.  He looked very emaciated and feeble.  I\r\nspoke to him, inquiring about his health.  He replied, \"I am just\r\ntottering around,\" and after a pause, added, \"Cullom, when I die\r\nand you die and Frye dies, and one or two others, this Senate will\r\nnot amount to much, will it?\"\r\n\r\nHe died a few months afterwards at his home in Washington, and in\r\nhis death there passed away the last of the old familiar type of\r\nSouthern statesmen, so frequently to be met with in Washington\r\nbefore the Civil War, and the last Senator who served as a Brigadier-\r\nGeneral in the Confederate Army.\r\n\r\nSenator Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts, became a member of\r\nthe committee at the same time that I was placed on it; but, by\r\nreason of my longer service in the Senate, according to the usual\r\ncustom, I outranked him.\r\n\r\nSenator Lodge, by general consent I believe, is regarded to-day as\r\nthe most cultivated man in the Senate.  He is a scholar, an author,\r\nand a noted historian.  He is a very able man in any position in\r\nwhich he is placed.  Judged by the standard of his great predecessor\r\nin the Senate from Massachusetts, Daniel Webster, he is not an\r\norator, but he is a very effective speaker and a good debater.  He\r\nis one of the very active members and has always taken a prominent\r\npart in the disposition of matters coming before the Upper House.\r\nHe is always ready to work, and when I desire any matter to be\r\ndisposed of without delay, I refer it to Senator Lodge as a\r\nsubcommittee, with confidence that it will be attended to quickly\r\nand correctly.\r\n\r\nHe is a strong, active Republican, and a politician (using that\r\nterm in its higher sense) of no mean order.  For years in Republican\r\nNational Conventions he has been a conspicuous figure; and twice\r\nat least--once at Philadelphia in 1900, and again in Chicago in\r\n1908--he has been permanent chairman.  On both occasions--and I\r\nattended both conventions--he proved himself to be a splendid\r\npresiding officer.  He regards his position as the senior Senator\r\nfrom Massachusetts, the successor of Webster and Sumner and a long\r\nline of noted men, as even a higher honor then the Presidency\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nI have seen it repeatedly stated that Senator Lodge is unpopular\r\nin the Senate,--that he is cold and formal.  From my long acquaintance\r\nwith him, extending over some seventeen years, I have not found\r\nthis to be true.  In times of trouble and distress in my own life,\r\nI have found him to be warm and sympathetic.\r\n\r\nI hope that he will remain in the Senate for many years to come.\r\nShould he retire, his loss would be severely felt both as a member\r\nof the Committee on Foreign Relations and as a member of the Senate.\r\n\r\nSenator Augustus O. Bacon, of Georgia, is now the senior member of\r\nthe minority on the committee; and should the control of the Senate\r\npass into the hands of the Democrats, he will, if he remain in the\r\nSenate, naturally become its chairman.  He is an able lawyer, and\r\nif subject to criticism at all, I would say that he is a little\r\ntoo technical as a jurist.  I do not say this to disparage him,\r\nbecause in the active practice of his profession at the bar this\r\nwould be regarded to his credit rather than otherwise; and even as\r\na member of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, this disposition\r\nto magnify technicalities makes him one of the most valuable members\r\nof that committee.  As a Senator, he is jealous of the prerogatives\r\nof the Senate, and vigorously resists the slightest encroachment\r\non the part of the Executive.  He is one of the effective debaters\r\non the Democratic side of the Senate, and seems to enjoy a controversy\r\nfor its own sake.  My intercourse with Senator Bacon as a member\r\nof the Committee on Foreign Relations has been most agreeable, and\r\nI have come to like and respect him very much.  In my time, he has\r\nbeen an exceptionally active, useful member, and he has often told\r\nme that he prefers his place as a member of the Foreign Relations\r\nCommittee to any other committeeship in the Senate.  He is well\r\nequipped, by education and training, for the work of the committee,\r\nand gives close attention to important treaties and other measures\r\ncoming before it.  He stood with Senator Morgan in opposing the\r\nratification of the Panama canal treaty, and he was as much in\r\nearnest in his opposition to it as was Senator Morgan; but unlike\r\nthe Senator from Alabama, he did not attack Senators personally\r\nwho differed from him.  When technical matters of importance came\r\nbefore the committee I usually appointed Senator Spooner and Senator\r\nBacon as a subcommittee, as I felt that anything that these two\r\nmight agree upon would be right, and would be concurred in by the\r\ncommittee and by the Senate as well.\r\n\r\nSenator Clarence D. Clark, of Wyoming, was a member of the House\r\nfor two terms, and has served in the Senate for about fifteen years.\r\nIn point of service, he is one of the oldest of the Western Senators.\r\nUnlike the Eastern States, very few of the Western States return\r\ntheir Senators for term after term; and the value of this, as a\r\nmatter of State pride, is well demonstrated in the case of Senator\r\nClark.  It has enabled him to reach the high position of chairman\r\nof the Judiciary Committee, the successor of a long line of able\r\nlawyers,--Trumbull, Edmunds, Thurman, Hoar, and O. H. Platt being\r\na few of his immediate predecessors.\r\n\r\nSenator Clark has been a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations\r\nfor thirteen years, and a more agreeable member of a committee it\r\nwould be difficult to find.  He is a capable lawyer, and a man of\r\nsound common sense.  I regret that his arduous duties as chairman\r\nof the Judiciary Committee do not permit him to give as close\r\nattention to the Foreign Relations Committee as I would like; but\r\nhe always attends when there are matters of particular importance\r\nbefore it; and I have great respect for his judgment in the\r\ndisposition of matters in which he takes any interest at all.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Hernando de Soto Money, of Mississippi, has for years been\r\none of the leading Democratic members of Congress.  For fourteen\r\nyears he was a member of the House of Representatives, a prominent\r\nmember, too, and he has been a member of the Senate since 1897.\r\nHis long service in the House at once enabled him to take his place\r\nas a leader of his party, a Senator admired and respected by his\r\ncolleagues on both sides.  He was appointed to the Foreign Relations\r\nCommittee in 1899, and I have been intimately acquainted with him\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nSenator Money is a highly educated, cultured gentleman, and has\r\ntravelled extensively over the world.  His broad liberal education,\r\nadded to his travel, and his extensive knowledge of world history,\r\nmade him an especially valuable member of the committee of which\r\nI am chairman.  During the past few years I have sympathized with\r\nhim very greatly as he has suffered physical pain to a greater\r\ndegree than any other man whom I have known, and yet has insisted\r\non attending diligently to his official duties.  He must be a man\r\nof extraordinary will power, or he would never have been able to\r\nconquer his physical suffering to such an extent as to enable him\r\nto attend to his Senatorial duties, and at the same time to obtain\r\nthe fund of information which he possesses, as he demonstrated over\r\nand over again in the Senate.\r\n\r\nHe retired voluntarily from the Senate on the fourth of March, 1911.\r\n\r\nOf the many Senators with whom I have been associated in the\r\ncommittee on Foreign Relations, and especially since I became its\r\nchairman, there are two, both now retired to private life, in whom\r\nI had the greatest confidence and for whom I entertained great\r\naffection, as they both did for me--these Senators were the Hon.\r\nJ. B. Foraker of Ohio, and the Hon. John C. Spooner of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nSenator Foraker preceded Senator Spooner as a member of this\r\ncommittee by some four years.  I do not know how it first came\r\nabout, but I became very intimate with Senator Foraker almost\r\nimmediately after he entered the Senate, and at once grew to admire\r\nhim exceedingly.  He is a very brilliant man, and has had a notable\r\ncareer.  He enlisted in the Union Army as a private when sixteen\r\nyears old, and retired at the close of the war, a Captain.  He then\r\ncompleted his education, and entered upon the practice of the law.\r\nHe was elected Judge of the Superior Court at Cincinnati, and later\r\nbecame a candidate for Governor.  The occupant of many civil\r\npositions of importance in his State, a prominent figure in national\r\nconvention after national convention, nominating Senator Sherman\r\nfor the Presidency in 1884 and 1888, and placing in nomination Mr.\r\nMcKinley in 1896, Senator Foraker had established a record in public\r\nlife, and had gathered a wealth of experience, sufficient to satisfy\r\nthe ambitions of most men, before his great public career really\r\ncommenced as a member of the United States Senate, in 1897.  He\r\nalso nominated McKinley in 1900.\r\n\r\nSenator Foraker was one of the most independent men with whom I\r\never served in the Senate.  He was a man of such ability and\r\nunquestioned courage that he did not hesitate to take any position\r\nwhich he himself deemed to be right, regardless of the views of\r\nothers.  It would inure to the advantage of the country if there\r\nwas a more general disposition among public men to adhere to their\r\nown convictions, regardless of what current opinion might be.\r\nSenator Foraker always made up his mind on public questions and\r\nclung to his own opinion in the face of all criticism.  The most\r\nstriking instance of this trait was when he, the only Republican\r\nSenator to do so, voted against the Hepburn Rate Bill, because he\r\nbelieved it to be unconstitutional.  The very fact that he stood\r\nalone in his opposition to that bill did not seem to bother him in\r\nthe least.\r\n\r\nOn the recommendation of President Roosevelt, the Committee on\r\nImmigration of the Senate attempted to pass a very drastic Chinese\r\nexclusion law.  I examined the bill and became convinced at once\r\nthat it was absolutely contrary to and in violation of our treaties\r\nwith China.  I was very much surprised at the time that even Senator\r\nLodge, one of the most conservative of Senators, supported the\r\nbill.  I was deluged with telegrams from labor organizations, as\r\nI knew Senator Foraker was, favoring the passage of the bill; but\r\nhe, with Senator Platt of Connecticut, and some others in the\r\nSenate, whom I assisted as best I could, led the opposition to the\r\nbill reported by the Committee on Immigration and defeated it.\r\nSenator Foraker very well knew that his opposition to this bill\r\nwould not strengthen him at home, but he disregarded that fact and\r\nopposed it because he believed it was contrary to our treaty\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nA more recent case in which he showed his independence was his\r\ntaking up the fight of the troops dismissed on account of the so-\r\ncalled Brownsville affair.  This was very unselfish on the part of\r\nSenator Foraker.  He had nothing to gain by espousing the cause of\r\na few negroes, but much to lose by antagonizing the National\r\nadministration.  He did not hesitate a moment, however.  There is\r\nno question that President Roosevelt acted hastily in dismissing\r\nthe entire company; but this was one occasion when President\r\nRoosevelt would not recede even though it became perfectly clear\r\nto almost every one in Congress that he was wrong.\r\n\r\nSenator Foraker always did make it a point to attend the meetings\r\nof the Committee on Foreign Relations, but for some reason or other\r\nhe was never punctual and was seldom in attendance when the committee\r\nwas called to order.  But at the same time he was prepared on all\r\nimportant questions coming before the committee.  He seemed to me\r\nto have given attention beforehand to subjects which he knew would\r\ncome before a particular meeting, and his opinion on any treaty or\r\nbill before the committee was always sought by his colleagues and\r\nlistened to with respect, and almost without exception his opinion\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nI regretted exceedingly to see him retire from the Senate.  From\r\nthe time he entered that body, he was consistently one of the\r\nprincipal defenders of Republican policies and Republican\r\nadministrations on the floor of the Senate.\r\n\r\nSenator John C. Spooner, of Wisconsin, was, in my judgment, one of\r\nthe best lawyers who ever served as a member of the Senate, and\r\namong its membership we find the names of the greatest lawyers and\r\njudges of America.  He had served in the Civil War, having retired\r\nat its close with the brevet of Major.  He early took up the law\r\nas a career, and never abandoned it, even when elected to the\r\nSenate; and as I write this, I believe he is regarded as one of\r\nthe foremost lawyers of New York.\r\n\r\nHe came into the Senate two years after I entered that body, and\r\nI remember him there as opposing the conference report on the\r\nInterstate Commerce Act.  His State having passed into the control\r\nof the Democrats, he retired from the Senate in 1891, but was re-\r\nelected in 1897.  He declined several tenders of cabinet positions,\r\npreferring to remain independent as a Senator.\r\n\r\nI knew him for a good many years.  Representing a neighboring State,\r\nas he did in the Senate, I became very intimate with him, and never\r\nhad the slightest hesitancy in seeking his advice when I was in\r\ndoubt concerning any legal or constitutional question.\r\n\r\nSenator Spooner was a much more technical lawyer than Senator\r\nForaker, but not quite so technical as Senator Bacon.  On questions\r\ncoming before the Committee on Foreign Relations, his advice was\r\nalways to be trusted.  My judgment in this respect may be influenced\r\nby our close personal friendship; but I always felt that when I\r\nhad his support on any question I was safe and right in the position\r\nI took respecting it.  Seldom within my knowledge did the Senate\r\nfail to agree with any attitude that Senator Spooner assumed on a\r\ncontroverted question.\r\n\r\nSenator Spooner was placed on the committee at the time I became\r\nits chairman.  At that time there were before the committee treaties,\r\nlegislation, and matters of the utmost importance.  He entered upon\r\nthe work with the greatest interest, and exercised commanding\r\ninfluence in the disposition of matters under consideration.  He\r\nalways seemed to take particular interest in my success as chairman\r\nof the committee, and always wanted to assist and help me wherever\r\nhe could.\r\n\r\nWe were wrestling with the Reciprocity treaty with Cuba at a meeting.\r\nIt had been before the committee for a number of meetings; Senator\r\nSpooner feared that I was about to turn the treaty over to another\r\nSenator to report, and he sent me, while the committee was in\r\nsession, a brief note marked \"Confidential.\"  It read:\r\n\r\n\"The report is that you will give this treaty to another to report.\r\nI think you should report it yourself, as you are not only chairman\r\nof the committee, but you are also a member of the Committee on\r\nRelations with Cuba.  Platt spoke to me about it.  He felt sensitive\r\nin the first place because the treaty did not go to his committee.\r\nThe fact that you and others on this committee were on his committee\r\nreconciled him.  I will stand to your shoulder in the fight for\r\nits ratification.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours,\r\n  \"Spooner.\"\r\n\r\nI hope Senator Spooner, if he does me the honor of glancing through\r\nthese rambling recollections, will forgive my quoting this confidential\r\nnote without his consent; but I do so only to show the very friendly\r\nand confidential relationship that existed between us.\r\n\r\nI doubt very much whether the Colombia or Panama treaty would have\r\nbeen ratified, or the Panama route selected in preference to the\r\nNicaraguan route for the Isthmian canal, despite the great influence\r\nof Senator Hanna, had not Senator Spooner joined in advocating the\r\nPanama route.\r\n\r\nIt was a long and difficult struggle, not only before the Committee\r\non Foreign Relations, but before the Committee on Interoceanic\r\nCanals, and resulted in the retirement of Senator Morgan as chairman\r\nof the last-mentioned committee--a position he had held for many\r\nyears--and in the selection of Senator Hanna to succeed him.  But\r\nSenator Spooner, through his technical knowledge, dominated the\r\nCommittee on Interoceanic Canals, and succeeded finally in the\r\npassage of the Spooner act which designated Panama, if that route\r\ncould be purchased, as the route for the canal.\r\n\r\nSenator Spooner was one of the real leaders of the Senate from 1897\r\nuntil he retired.  He was one of the most eloquent men who served\r\nin the Senate during that period.  During all the debates on the\r\nCuban question, the important results growing out of the Spanish-\r\nAmerican War, the question of Imperialism--his participation in\r\nall these momentous subjects was above criticism.  I have heard\r\nhim in the Senate, speaking day after day.  He never grew tiresome;\r\nnever repeated himself; always held the most profound attention of\r\nthe Senate; and his closing words were listened to with the same\r\nattention and with the same interest, by his colleagues and by the\r\ngalleries, as marked the beginning of any of his speeches.  After\r\nhis conclusions his Republican colleagues invariably gathered around\r\nhim, offering their congratulations.\r\n\r\nSenator Spooner and Senator Foraker have both retired.  It was\r\nthought at the time that their places could not be filled, and I,\r\nas one of the older Senators who remember them well, can not believe\r\nthat their places have been filled.  Of all the Senators with whom\r\nI have served, Spooner and Foraker were most alike in their combative\r\nnatures, in their willingness to take the responsibility to go to\r\nthe front to lead the fight.  Senators come and go, the personnel\r\nof the Senate changes, one Senator will be replaced by another,\r\nbut the Senate itself will go on as long as the Republic endures.\r\n\r\nOne of the most dignified, honest, straightforward, capable men\r\nwith whom I have served, was the Hon. Charles W. Fairbanks, of\r\nIndiana.  He was a devoted adherent, friend, and follower of the\r\nlate President McKinley, and had been his friend long before he\r\nwas nominated for President in 1896.  Senator Fairbanks took a very\r\nprominent part in that convention, was its temporary chairman, and\r\nin 1900 was chairman of the Committee on Resolutions of the National\r\nConvention which met at Philadelphia.  He entered the Senate in\r\n1897, and during the following year was appointed by President\r\nMcKinley a member of the United States and British Joint High\r\nCommission for the adjustment of all outstanding questions concerning\r\nthe United States and Canada.  The commission was an exceedingly\r\nimportant one, but failing to agree on the Alaskan boundary, it\r\nwas compelled to adjourn without settling any of the questions\r\nbefore it.  Its labors were not wasted, however, as it furnished\r\nthe nucleus for the final adjustment of those questions under the\r\nadministration of Mr. Root, in the State Department.\r\n\r\nSenator Fairbanks was a close personal friend of President McKinley,\r\nand almost immediately assumed quite an important position in the\r\nSenate.  He was appointed to the Committee on Foreign Relations,\r\nof which he was quite an able and influential member, as he was of\r\nevery committee of the Senate on which he served.  He accepted the\r\nnomination of the Republican Convention of 1904 for Vice-President.\r\nI considered that his proper place was in the Senate; but for some\r\nreason or other he gave it out that he would not decline the\r\nnomination for the office of Vice-President, and neither would he\r\nseek it.  The Convention very wisely determined that he was the\r\nbest candidate that could be nominated.  The duties of the Vice-\r\nPresident are not very arduous; but in all my service in the Senate\r\nI do not know of a Vice-President who so strictly observed the\r\nobligation adherent to the office as did Mr. Fairbanks.  He was a\r\ncandidate for President in 1908 but was defeated by President Taft.\r\n\r\nSince his retirement from the Vice-Presidency, he has at least\r\ntwice been tendered high appointments in the diplomatic service,\r\nfirst as Ambassador to the Court of St. James, and, later (it having\r\nbeen rumored while he was travelling in China that he had expressed\r\nhimself as favorably inclined toward the acceptance of the position\r\nof minister to that country), Secretary Knox indicated a desire\r\nthrough mutual friends to have him appointed.  Mr. Fairbanks thanked\r\nhis friends, but declined the appointment.\r\n\r\nIn his tour around the world after retiring from the office of Vice-\r\nPresident, he conducted himself with great dignity and propriety.\r\n\r\nSenator Albert J. Beveridge succeeded Senator Fairbanks, as a member\r\nof the Committee on Foreign Relations.  For years Senator Beveridge\r\nhad seemed more than anxious to become a member of this committee.\r\nWhen he first entered the Senate he thought he should have been\r\nmade one of its members, as he had always taken a deep interest in\r\nforeign matters; but the Committee on Organization determined that\r\nhis colleague, Senator Fairbanks, was entitled to the preference.\r\nWhen Senator Fairbanks retired, I requested the Committee on\r\nOrganization to place Senator Beveridge on my committee, which it\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nI have always admired Senator Beveridge.  He is an exceptionally\r\nengaging speaker, a brilliant man, and so talented that one cannot\r\nhelp being attracted to him.  I had heard of him years before he\r\nentered the Senate.  The late Senator McDonald of Indiana, a strong,\r\ngifted lawyer and the highest type of a man, told me one day that\r\nhe had a young man in his office, named Beveridge, who knew more\r\nabout the politics of the day than almost any other man in the\r\nState, and he believed he would be a controlling factor in Republican\r\npolitics in Indiana.\r\n\r\nSenator Beveridge is a popular magazine writer, as he is one of\r\nthe most popular public speakers of to-day.  As a campaign orator,\r\nhis services are constantly in demand.\r\n\r\nI regret very much to say, that notwithstanding Senator Beveridge's\r\nprior anxiety to become a member of the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations, after his appointment he attended very few meetings and\r\napparently took little interest in its business.  His duties as\r\nChairman of the Committee on Territories, combined with work on\r\nother committees, necessarily consumed most of his time.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years after the Hon. John Kean, of New Jersey,\r\nentered the Senate, I had no special acquaintance with him, and I\r\ndid not welcome him particularly when he was made a member of the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations, in 1901.  Since then I have become\r\nvery intimate with Senator Kean, and there have been few men on\r\nthe committee for whom I entertained a higher regard, or in whom\r\nI placed more confidence.  He was a very industrious and useful\r\nmember, as he is in the Senate.  He filled quite a prominent place\r\nin the Senate, and watched legislation probably more closely than\r\nany other member.  He was always familiar with the bills on the\r\ncalendar, and made it a point to object to any questionable measures\r\nthat came before the Senate.  He advanced in influence and power\r\nvery rapidly in the last few years of his service.  Through Senator\r\nKean, I have been enabled very often to expedite the passage of\r\nmeasures, not only coming from the Committee on Foreign Relations,\r\nbut bills in which I have been interested pertaining to the affairs\r\nof my own State.  If the Senate had what is known as a \"whip,\" I\r\nwould say that Senator Kean comes more nearly being the Republican\r\n\"whip\" than any other Senator, with the possible exception, in\r\nrecent years, of Senator Murray Crane, of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSenator Thomas H. Carter, of Montana, a member of the committee in\r\nthe Sixty-first Congress, was one of the most popular members of\r\nthe Senate.  His ability as a lawyer and legislator, combined with\r\nhis wit and keen sense of humor, enabled him to assume quite a\r\ncommanding position in that body.  When feeling ran high in debate,\r\nsometimes almost to the point of personal encounter, Senator Carter\r\nwould appear, and by a few well-chosen words, voiced in his calm,\r\nquiet manner, throw oil upon the troubled waters, and peace again\r\nreigned supreme.\r\n\r\nI have known Senator Carter for very many years.  I knew him as a\r\nyoung man.  His home was at one time in Illinois, at the little\r\ntown of Pana, about twenty-five miles from my own home at Springfield.\r\nHe has held many public offices.  Delegate from the Territory of\r\nMontana, member of the Fifty-first Congress, Commissioner of the\r\nGeneral Land Office, Senator from 1895 to 1901 and from 1905 to\r\n1906, Chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1892, he\r\nhas in all these positions distinguished himself as a man of a high\r\norder of ability.  I have always liked Senator Carter very much,\r\nand I was glad indeed that he was named a member of the Committee\r\non Foreign Relations.  He is a very useful and influential member,\r\nas he is of the Senate.\r\n\r\nSenator William Alden Smith, of Michigan, was only recently placed\r\non the Committee on Foreign Relations, quite a distinction for a\r\nSenator who had served for so brief a time as a member of the\r\nSenate.  Senator Smith, however, was a prominent member of the\r\nHouse for many years, and was elected to the Senate while serving\r\nas a member of the House of Representatives.  He has taken position\r\nin the Senate very rapidly.  He is a lawyer of experience and long\r\npractice, and an industrious and competent legislator.  He is always\r\nwatchful of the interests of his State.  He took a prominent part\r\nin the consideration of the treaties between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain concerning Canada, more especially the boundary and\r\nwater-way treaties.  It was through his efforts that an amendment\r\nto the latter treaty was adopted, which he considered necessary to\r\nprotect the interests of his State, and which I greatly feared\r\nwould result in the rejection of the treaty by the Canadian\r\nParliament.  I am very glad to say, however, that the treaty has\r\nbeen ratified by both Governments, and only recently proclaimed.\r\n\r\nSenator Smith has taken a keen interest in matters before the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations, and with his experience, industry,\r\nand capacity, he is bound to become a very useful member of the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nOne of the last members to be appointed on the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations was the Hon. Elihu Root, of New York.  He is one of the\r\ngreatest men and ablest Senators who have ever been members of the\r\ncommittee.  When he became a member of it, he was not at all a\r\nstranger, for the reason that he, on my invitation, had, while\r\nSecretary of State, for two years previous to his retirement from\r\nthat office, attended almost every meeting of the committee.\r\nBetween Mr. Hay and the members of the Senate, there was not the\r\nclose relationship which should have existed between that body and\r\nthe State Department.\r\n\r\nSecretary Hay was not disposed to cultivate friendly relations with\r\nSenators, and certain remarks he made concerning the Senate as a\r\nbody were very distasteful to Senators; and although I had invited\r\nhim, he seemed very averse to coming before the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations.  I did not press the point.  The result was that important\r\ntreaties and other matters were constantly sent in, with which the\r\nmembers of the committee were not familiar, and we had to grope in\r\nthe dark, as it were, and inform ourselves concerning them as best\r\nwe could.\r\n\r\nBut when Mr. Root became Secretary of State, I resolved to insist\r\nthat the Secretary meet with us from time to time, and explain such\r\ntreaties and measures as might need explanation, and upon which\r\nthe Administration was anxious to secure favorable action.  In\r\nother words, there should be closer relationship between the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations and the State Department than had\r\nformerly existed.  I first saw President Roosevelt and told him I\r\nhoped Mr. Root would come before the committee as occasion might\r\nrequire.  The President seemed at once impressed with the propriety\r\nof the proposed plan, and remarked in his own characteristic fashion:\r\n\"That is just the thing.\"  I then saw Mr. Root, whom I knew very\r\nwell as Secretary of War, and he was more than pleased with the\r\nsuggestion, asserting that it was just what he wanted to do.  It\r\nso happened that during his administration of the State Department\r\nhe found it necessary to negotiate more treaties, and treaties of\r\ngreater importance, than any of his more recent predecessors in\r\nthat high office, and he became so constant and punctual in his\r\nattendance at the meetings of the committee that we grew almost to\r\nregard him as a regular member, even before he entered the Senate.\r\n\r\nHe has served on the committee but two sessions, but even in that\r\nshort time he has proved his fitness to fill the gap left by the\r\nretirement of Senators Spooner and Foraker.  As a lawyer he is as\r\nbrilliant as either of those men, and probably, owing to his\r\nexecutive experience, a more efficient statesman.  I regard him as\r\nthe best qualified man in this country for any position in the\r\npublic service which he would accept.  He would make a strong\r\nPresident, and as a Senator he is equipped with extraordinary\r\nqualifications.  If he remains in the Senate, by sheer force of\r\nability alone he is bound to become its acknowledged leader.  We\r\nhave never had a stronger Secretary of State.  Mr. Hay was a very\r\ngreat man in many respects, and could handle an international\r\nquestion, especially pertaining to the Far East, with more skill\r\nthan any of his predecessors; but Mr. Root, while probably not as\r\nwell versed in diplomacy as Mr. Hay, is one of the foremost lawyers\r\nin America, and has the faculty of going into the minutest details\r\nof every question, large or small, even to the extent of reorganizing\r\nall the multitude of details of the State Department.  He was the\r\nreal head of the department, and supervised every matter coming\r\nbefore it.\r\n\r\nAs Secretary of State he made it one of his policies to bring the\r\nrepublics of this hemisphere into closer relationship with one\r\nanother.  He visited South and Central America, and did much to\r\nbring about a friendly feeling with the republics of those regions.\r\n\r\nHe is one of those who insisted upon the absolute equality of\r\nnations, both great and small; and in this he was particularly\r\npointed in his instructions to the delegates representing the United\r\nStates at the Second Peace Conference at The Hague.\r\n\r\nHe did not retire from the State Department until he had adjusted\r\nalmost, if not all, outstanding questions between the United States\r\nand other Nations.  He closed up the work of the Joint High\r\nCommission, and by a series of treaties adjusted every factor of\r\ndifference between the United States and Great Britain concerning\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nBringing the consideration of the personnel of the committee up to\r\nthe close of the Sixty-first Congress, there remain to be mentioned\r\nonly William J. Stone, of Missouri, and Benjamin F. Shively, of\r\nIndiana, both Democrats.  Mr. Stone and Mr. Shively are not only\r\nnew men on the committee, but both of them are comparatively new\r\nto the Senate.  They had, however, been sufficiently tried in other\r\nfields of effort to justify their States in sending them to this\r\nexalted body, and the records both have made here have well vindicated\r\ntheir selection.  In a comparatively brief time they have attained\r\nto positions of leadership on the Democratic side of the chamber,\r\nand since they have become members of this committee they have\r\nmanifested an unusual grasp of international subjects.  They are\r\nfrom States which adjoin my own State of Illinois, and I am especially\r\npleased to have them as members of the committee of which I am\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\nWORK OF THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nWhen I became chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, in\r\n1901, I found a large quantity of undisposed of matter on the\r\ndockets, both legislative and executive.  I determined that I would\r\nat once proceed to clear the docket and endeavor to make the\r\ncommittee an active working one.  I have since made it a policy,\r\nas best I could, to secure some action, favorable or unfavorable,\r\non every matter referred to the committee by the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe first subject to which I turned my attention was the reciprocity\r\ntreaties between the United States and Barbados, Bermuda, British\r\nGuiana, Turk Islands and Caicos, Jamaica, Argentine Republic,\r\nFrance, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Denmark.\r\n\r\nThese treaties had been pending before the committee for two years,\r\nand I resolved as I expressed it to one Senator, who was opposed\r\nto them, that I would get them out of the committee \"if I had to\r\ncarry them out in a basket.\"  These treaties were negotiated under\r\nthe authority contained in the fourth section of the Dingley Act,\r\nwhich provided:\r\n\r\n\"Section 4.  That whenever the President of the United States, by\r\nand with the advice and consent of the Senate, with a view to secure\r\nreciprocal trade with foreign countries, shall, within a period of\r\ntwo years from and after the passage of this act, enter into\r\ncommercial treaty or treaties with any other country concerning\r\nthe admission to such country of goods, wares, or merchandise of\r\nthe United States . . . and in such treaty or treaties shall provide\r\nfor reduction during a specified period of the duties imposed by\r\nthis act, to the extent of twenty per centum thereof, upon such\r\ngoods, wares, or merchandise as may be designated therein, . . .\r\nor shall provide for the transfer during such period from the\r\ndutiable list of this act to the free list thereof of such goods,\r\nwares, or merchandise the product of foreign countries; and when\r\n. . . any such treaty shall have been duly ratified by the Senate\r\nand approved by Congress, then and thereafter the duties which\r\nshall be collected by the United States upon any of the designated\r\ngoods, wares, or merchandise from the foreign country with which\r\nsuch treaty has been made, shall, during the period provided for,\r\nbe the duties specified and provided in such treaty, and none\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable opposition to the ratification of these\r\ntreaties in the Senate, and very strong opposition to them in the\r\ncommittee.  President McKinley was very much in favor of their\r\nratification, and as one treaty after another expired, a new one\r\nwould be made reviving it.\r\n\r\nThe first problem which confronted me was this:  The fourth section\r\nof the Dingley Act provided that such treaties should be made only\r\nwithin two years after the passage of the act; the two years had\r\nlong since expired--could the Senate ratify them at all?\r\n\r\nI submitted to the Senate a report on the constitutional question.\r\nThe single question covered was, whether the treaties not having\r\nbeen ratified by the Senate within the two years specified in the\r\nDingley Act were still within its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe committee determined that the President and the Senate are,\r\nunder the Constitution, the treaty-making power.  The initiative\r\nlies with the President.  He can negotiate such treaties as may\r\nseem to him wise, and propose them to the Senate for the advice\r\nand consent of that body.  The power of the President and the Senate\r\nis derived from the Constitution.  There is under our Constitution\r\nno other source of treaty-making power.  The Congress is without\r\npower to grant to the President or to the Senate any authority with\r\nrespect to treaties; nor does the Congress possess any power to\r\nfetter or limit in any way the President or the Senate in the\r\nexercise of this constitutional function.  It cannot in any way\r\nenlarge, limit, or attach conditions to the treaty-making power,\r\nand the subcommittee concluded their report on this branch of the\r\nsubject with this statement:\r\n\r\n\"The committee is clearly of the opinion that nothing contained in\r\nsection four of the Dingley Act constitutes any valid restriction\r\nupon the jurisdiction and power of the Senate to act upon the\r\ncommercial treaties now pending.\"\r\n\r\nThat question being disposed of to my satisfaction, I proceeded to\r\nurge the consideration of the treaties at every meeting of the\r\ncommittee for many months, but it was not until June, 1902, that\r\nI secured the favorable report of all the treaties, excepting the\r\ntreaty with the Argentine Republic and that with Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThere was another very serious question which I raised myself, and\r\nthat was, whether legislation was necessary to carry them into\r\neffect, or whether the treaties were self-executing.  None of the\r\ntreaties contained any provision for legislation, and by their\r\nterms, they would go into effect without legislation.  John A.\r\nKasson, who negotiated them, told me that he purposely left out\r\nany reference to legislative action, because the executive department\r\nhad serious doubts on the subject, and preferred to permit the\r\nSenate itself to pass upon it.\r\n\r\nI have always contended that reciprocity treaties, like other\r\ntreaties in general, are self-executing, if by their terms they do\r\nnot provide for legislative action.\r\n\r\nI made a very extended address in the Senate on January 29, 1902,\r\nbecause I wanted to get the attention of the Senate to this important\r\nconstitutional subject.  I said in opening:\r\n\r\n\"Has Congress any power or authority, under the Constitution, over\r\ntreaties?  This subject has been discussed at different times during\r\nour entire Constitutional history.  It is a very complicated\r\nquestion, not only because the authority of the House on the subject\r\nof treaties has been disputed and argued almost from the very\r\nadoption of the Constitution, but the fourth section of the Dingley\r\nAct specifically provides how and when such treaties shall be made.\r\n. . . In my opinion the fourth section of the Dingley Act, so far\r\nas it attempts to confer, limit, or define the treaty-making power\r\nis not only an unwarranted interference with the powers of the\r\nPresident and Senate, but is unconstitutional, because it comes in\r\nconflict with that clause of the Constitution which says that the\r\nPresident shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate to make treaties.  No law of Congress can in any way\r\nmodify or limit those powers.  The Dingley Law can not limit the\r\ntime in which we shall be allowed to make a treaty; it can not give\r\nto Congress any power on the subject of treaties not given it by\r\nthe Constitution, and under the Constitution Congress as a legislative\r\nbody is not a part of the treaty-making power.\"\r\n\r\nI contended that the fourth section of the Dingley Act, if considered\r\nby the Executive at all, should be merely as an expression of the\r\nviews of Congress in the adjustment of the specific terms of each\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nBut the particular question in which I was more interested and to\r\nwhich I devoted most of my remarks was, whether a reciprocity\r\ntreaty, which by its terms provides that the duties to be collected\r\nafter its ratification shall be those specified in the treaty, and\r\nnone other (and which makes no reference to further Congressional\r\naction), would of its own force operate to repeal so much of the\r\ntariff act as may come in conflict with it, or whether it would be\r\nnecessary for Congress to act on a treaty before those duties are\r\nreduced, and before the treaty shall become the supreme law of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nI then proceeded to a minute examination into the history of the\r\ntreaty-making provision in the Constitution, tracing it through\r\nthe Constitutional Convention, and giving the views of the framers\r\nof the Constitution as to its scope and effect.  It was Alexander\r\nHamilton who drafted the treaty-making clause of the Federal\r\nConstitution, and it was purposely so framed as to exclude the\r\nHouse from all consideration of treaties.  Twice it was proposed\r\nin the Constitutional Convention to unite the House of Representatives\r\nwith the Senate in the approval of treaties, but both times it was\r\nrejected almost unanimously, Pennsylvania alone voting in the\r\naffirmative.  The treaty-making clause of the Federal Constitution\r\nwas adopted in the Constitutional Convention only after a most\r\nvigorous fight against it by those who contended that the authority\r\nconferred was too great.  Patrick Henry thought that, \"If the clause\r\nwere adopted as it was submitted to the State, two-thirds of a\r\nquorum of the Senate would be empowered to make treaties that might\r\nrelinquish and alienate territorial rights and our most valuable\r\ncommercial advantages.  In short, should anything be left, it would\r\nbe because the President and Senators would be pleased to admit\r\nit.  The power of making treaties under the Constitution extends\r\nfarther than in any country in the world.  Treaties have more force\r\nhere than in any part of Christendom.\"  And he begged the convention\r\nto stop before it conceded this power unguarded and unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe power was conferred on the President and the Senate, unguarded\r\nand unaltered, when the Constitution was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe question came before the House of Representatives the first\r\ntime just seven years after the Constitution was adopted, and has\r\nbeen before the House many times since then.  The Jay Treaty called\r\nfor an appropriation of eighty thousand dollars.  It was a very\r\nunpopular treaty, and a very notable debate took place on the\r\nresolution requesting the President to lay before the House copies\r\nof the correspondence and other papers relating to the treaty.\r\nPresident Washington declined to furnish the papers, on the ground\r\nthat the treaty needed no legislative action, and the House had\r\nnothing whatever to do with treaties, but was morally bound to make\r\nthe appropriation, thereby carrying out the contract.  The House\r\nresponded by passing a long series of resolutions; but finally the\r\nappropriation was made.\r\n\r\nThe whole question has been discussed in the House, practically\r\nevery time an appropriation has been called for to carry out a\r\ntreaty; but the House, while always contending that it had a voice\r\nin the treaty-making power, never declined to make the appropriation,\r\nand only on one occasion do I now recall that the House declined\r\nto enact legislation to carry out a treaty where the treaty\r\nspecifically itself provided for such legislation.  This was in\r\nthe case of the reciprocity treaty with Mexico, negotiated by\r\nGeneral Grant.\r\n\r\nI concluded my speech in the Senate with this statement:\r\n\r\n\"This question before us here has been before the Senate for a\r\nhundred years.  The Executive and Senate have taken one position,\r\nand that is a treaty is the supreme law of the land.  That position\r\nhas been sustained by the Supreme Court.  On the other hand, during\r\nall these hundred years, the House of Representatives has, as a\r\nrule, insisted that they should be considered in reference to\r\ncertain treaties.  That does not relieve the Senate from standing\r\nby its prerogatives and rights and insisting that the rights of\r\nthe Executive be maintained.  The point here is this:  the Constitution\r\ngives to the Executive, with the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nthe right to negotiate treaties.  We have been negotiating commercial\r\ntreaties continuously prior and subsequent to the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, and those treaties have been sustained as the supreme\r\nlaw of the land.\r\n\r\n\"It is said that the Constitution has given to Congress the right\r\nto regulate commerce with foreign nations, to lay and collect taxes,\r\nduties, and imposts, and to the House of Representatives the right\r\nto originate bills for raising revenues, and to the President and\r\nSenate the right to make and ratify treaties.  These are all co-\r\nequal and independent powers.  One does not interfere with the\r\nother.  One is not exclusive of the other.  A law passed in any of\r\nthe ways provided by the Constitution is the supreme law of the\r\nland until it is changed or repealed.  A treaty made by the Executive\r\nand ratified by the Senate is the supreme law of the land as well\r\nas an act of Congress.  If the Congress is not satisfied with the\r\ntreaty, it has a perfect right to repeal it, as it has any other\r\nlaw; but until such action is taken, the treaty remains as a part\r\nof the supreme law of the land; and I cannot see any distinction\r\nbetween treaties which affect the tariff laws, and treaties affecting\r\nany other law.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject was very seriously and carefully considered, but it\r\nwas thought expedient that the committee should not take any position\r\neither for or against the unlimited power of the Senate over\r\nreciprocity treaties.  It was Senator Spooner who suggested that\r\neach of the treaties be amended by inserting therein a provision\r\nthat \"the treaty not take effect until the same shall have been\r\napproved by the Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe merits of the question were not considered; but my position\r\nwas, and still is, that amending the treaties in the manner suggested\r\nby Senator Spooner, by inference indicated that if such a provision\r\nhad not been inserted, the treaties would go into effect immediately\r\nwithout any Congressional action.\r\n\r\nAside from the reciprocity treaty with France, none of the treaties\r\nwas considered by the Senate itself.  I pressed them as best I\r\ncould, but Senator Aldrich, Senator Hanna, and other advocates of\r\nhigh protection, were so bitterly opposed to them--no one in the\r\nSenate aside from myself seeming to have much interest in them--\r\nthat they were dropped and allowed to expire by their own terms.\r\nI particularly regretted that the Kasson treaties were not ratified.\r\n\r\nHad the Senate ratified those treaties, a large number of other\r\ntreaties probably would have been negotiated, and we would not have\r\nbeen compelled to go through the long struggle and agitation over\r\nthe passage of the Aldrich-Payne Tariff Bill.  There would have\r\nbeen no tariff revision necessary.  At the same time, we could not\r\npossibly help vastly increasing our foreign commerce.  It was a\r\nvery short-sighted policy on the part of Senator Aldrich and others\r\nin the Senate when they insisted that those treaties should be\r\nkilled.  After it was determined, and it became so known to the\r\ncountry that it would be impossible to secure the ratification of\r\nreciprocity treaties, the agitation for tariff revision commenced,\r\nand finally culminated in the act of 1909, which resulted in the\r\nelection of a Democratic House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe committee did favorably report, and the Senate ratify, a\r\nreciprocity treaty with Cuba.  This was the treaty of December 11,\r\n1902, and it was the third reciprocal agreement in all our history\r\nratified, proclaimed, and placed in effect.  The first one was the\r\ntreaty of 1854, providing for reciprocity with Canada.  The second\r\nwas the treaty of 1875, with the Hawaiian Islands, and the third\r\nand the only one now in effect is the treaty with Cuba.\r\n\r\nThat treaty would never have been ratified, and would have suffered\r\nthe same fate as the Kasson treaties, had it not been for the\r\ndetermined, vigorous fight made by President Roosevelt for its\r\nratification, and had not Cuba stood in a relation to us entirely\r\ndifferent from any other country.  We bound her to us by insisting\r\nthat the Platt amendments be made a part of her Constitution, and\r\nin addition that a treaty be made between the two countries embodying\r\nthose amendments.\r\n\r\nThis treaty with Cuba and the law carrying it into effect were the\r\noccasion of a very bitter struggle in both Senate and House.  The\r\nsugar and tobacco interests used all the power at their command to\r\ndefeat, first the treaty, and then the law carrying the treaty into\r\neffect.  The beet-sugar people asserted that it would ruin that\r\nindustry, and that a reduction of twenty per cent on Cuban sugar\r\nwould enable the Cubans to ship their sugar into the United States\r\nand undersell the beet sugar.  I never could see that there was\r\nany force in their contention, because the United States does not\r\nproduce more than half the sugar we consume, and it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to import sugar from Cuba and other sugar-producing\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nWhen the treaty was before the committee for consideration, it was\r\namended by inserting the following proviso:\r\n\r\n\"Provided that while this convention is in force, no sugar exported\r\nfrom the Republic of Cuba and being the product of the soil or\r\nindustry of the Republic of Cuba, shall be admitted to the United\r\nStates at a reduction of duty greater than twenty per centum of\r\nthe rates of duty thereon as provided by the tariff act of the\r\nUnited States, approved July 24, 1897; and no sugar, the product\r\nof any other foreign country, shall be admitted by treaty or\r\nconvention into the United States, while this convention is in\r\nforce, at a lower rate of duty than that provided by the tariff\r\nact of the United States, approved July 24, 1897.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this amendment was not only to prevent a greater\r\nreduction being made on Cuban sugar, but it had a more important\r\neffect that it made reciprocity treaties with the sugar-producing\r\ncountries, including the West Indies, impossible so long as the\r\nCuban treaty remains in force.\r\n\r\nI had charge of this treaty in the Senate, and addressed the Senate\r\nat considerable length explaining its provisions.\r\n\r\nThere was a spirited contest in the Senate over the ratification\r\nof the treaty, but there was more of a contest both in the Senate\r\nand the House when the bill to carry the treaty into effect came\r\nup at the next session of Congress, it first having been considered\r\nat a special session called by President Roosevelt in November,\r\n1903.  A provision was inserted in the treaty (which I opposed, as\r\nI thought it was unnecessary), that it should not go into effect\r\nuntil it was approved by the Congress.  The bill was passed in the\r\nHouse and came to the Committee on Foreign Relations, was considered\r\nthere, and favorably reported to the Senate.  The bill, of course,\r\nwas considered in open session, and I again made some remarks,\r\nprobably more in the nature of a report than a speech, trying to\r\nshow where the treaty was not only absolutely necessary, if Cuba\r\nwas to be prosperous at all, but that it would open a considerable\r\nmarket for American products.\r\n\r\nThe Cuban reciprocity treaty has increased very materially our\r\ntrade with that Republic.  Since that treaty went into effect our\r\nimports from Cuba have increased from $62,942,000 in value to\r\n$122,528,000 in value; and our exports to Cuba have increased from\r\n$21,000,000 in 1903, to nearly $53,000,000 in 1910, or more than\r\ndoubled.  But even with this considerable increase in our exports\r\nto Cuba, I had hoped that by this time we should have increased\r\nthem to at least one hundred million dollars.  Our own exporters\r\nand manufacturers are at fault, because they will not do business\r\nwith the Cubans on the same credit basis as will the exporters of\r\nSpain, Germany, and England; and American exporters do not cater\r\nto the peculiar needs of the Cubans.  They seem to go on the theory\r\nthat if their goods are good enough for Americans they should be\r\ngood enough for Cubans, too.\r\n\r\nThe Cuban treaty is a good illustration of the scare and the\r\nunwarranted opposition on the part of American industries when even\r\nthe slightest reduction of the tariff is attempted.  To listen to\r\nthe beet-sugar and tobacco interests during the consideration of\r\nthe Cuban treaty, one would think they would have been absolutely\r\nruined if the treaty were ratified.  The Cuban treaty has not in\r\nthe slightest degree injuriously affected the American sugar or\r\ntobacco interests.\r\n\r\nThe principle of Reciprocity as heretofore applied in this country\r\nhas been extended somewhat by the agreement of 1911 between the\r\nUnited States and Canada.  This compact was negotiated by President\r\nTaft and Secretary Knox on the one side, and by Premier Laurier\r\nand Mr. Fielding on the other.  Under this agreement a wide exchange\r\nof articles of every-day use is provided for, and it is hoped and\r\nbelieved that if the treaty becomes effective it will prove more\r\nsatisfactory and enduring than the previous reciprocal agreement\r\nwith the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe pending agreement was entered into between representatives of\r\nthe two Governments in January, 1911, but it was not until the\r\nlatter part of July of that year that a law was enacted by Congress\r\nto provide for its enforcement.  Much opposition was manifested,\r\nespecially in the Senate, in both the Sixty-first and Sixty-second\r\nCongresses, on the ground that under its terms a great many\r\nagricultural products are admitted free from Canada; but this\r\nobjection has been, I think, successfully met by the Administration\r\nand its friends in the argument that any injury that might be\r\nsustained by agriculture would be more than compensated for by the\r\nbenefits derived by the manufacturing interests.  For one I have\r\nnever believed that agriculture would suffer in any degree through\r\nthe operation of the agreement, and I do believe that the general\r\nindustries of the country will experience much benefit.  Too much\r\nis to be gained through the cultivation of proper trade relations\r\nwith our great and growing neighbor on the North to abandon the\r\ngeneral principle involved in the agreement on account of an\r\napprehension which may not and probably will not be realized.\r\n\r\nIn many respects nations are like individuals, and in their relations\r\nwith one another they should be controlled by the same rules of\r\namity and equity as pertain to the associations of mankind generally.\r\nIn the end no nation can lose any material thing through an act of\r\ngenerosity or fair-dealing.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the United States has acted favorably upon the\r\nagreement, it is not yet in force.  This circumstance is due to\r\nthe fact that in the matter of ratification Canada has waited upon\r\nthis country.  There is opposition there as there was here, and at\r\nthis writing (August, 1911) Sir Wilfred Laurier is engaged in a\r\nstruggle for favorable endorsement such as that from which President\r\nTaft has just emerged.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\nTHE INTEROCEANIC CANAL\r\n\r\nProbably the most important work before the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations since the treaty of peace with Spain, were the several\r\ntreaties concerning the construction of the Isthmian Canal.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, the United States entered into what is known as the Clayton-\r\nBulwer Treaty with Great Britain, the purpose of which was to\r\nfacilitate the construction of a canal; but instead of operating\r\nto this end, it stood for fifty years or more as an effectual\r\nbarrier against the construction by the United States of any canal\r\nacross the Isthmus of Panama.  Succeeding Administrations had\r\nendeavored to secure the consent of Great Britain to its abrogation,\r\nbut it was not until Secretary Hay's time that Great Britain\r\nfinally agreed to annul it and substitute in its place a new treaty.\r\nSecretary Hay had been Ambassador to Great Britain, and he enjoyed\r\nthe confidence of the then existing British Ministry to a greater\r\ndegree than almost any minister or ambassador we have ever sent to\r\nGreat Britain.  After entering the State Department, Mr. Hay at\r\nonce directed his attention to the making of a new treaty with\r\nGreat Britain and this resulted in the first Hay-Pauncefote Treaty.\r\nThis convention was considered by the committee, but was not found\r\nsatisfactory, and certain amendments were added to it.  These\r\namendments Great Britain would not accept, and the treaty died.\r\n\r\nSecretary Hay was very much disappointed, but he at once set to\r\nwork to negotiate such a treaty as would go through the Senate\r\nwithout amendment and such a one as Great Britain would consent\r\nto.  He wrote to a number of Senators, members of the committee,\r\nI suppose, asking for suggestions as to just what the Senate would\r\nagree to.  I was not at that time chairman of the Committee on\r\nForeign Relations, but I was very deeply interested in the subject\r\nand had given it considerable study and thought.  Secretary Hay\r\nwrote me, and I replied at length, giving my views both as to the\r\nClayton-Bulwer Treaty and what I thought should be inserted in the\r\nnew treaty.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay promptly renewed negotiations, which resulted in what is\r\nknown as the second Hay-Pauncefote Treaty.  After a good deal of\r\neffort this agreement was ratified without amendment.  This act\r\nsignalized the beginning of my service as chairman of the Committee\r\non Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\nThe principal contention arose over the subject of fortifications,\r\na question that is still a mooted one.  It occurs to me that the\r\nproper reasoning is this--and I believe I took the same position\r\nwhen the treaty was under consideration:\r\n\r\nThe first and second Hay-Pauncefote treaties must be construed\r\ntogether; the first Hay-Pauncefote Treaty contained a prohibition\r\nagainst fortification; the second Hay-Pauncefote Treaty neither\r\nprohibited nor in terms agreed to fortifications, but was silent\r\non the subject; therefore, the legal construction would be that\r\nGreat Britain had receded from the position that the canal should\r\nnot be fortified.  In any event, we will go ahead and fortify the\r\ncanal, and do with it whatever we please, regardless of any of the\r\nnations of the world.\r\n\r\nThat obstacle having been finally removed, the question which next\r\narose was:  What route should be selected?  The selection of the\r\nroute was not a subject over which the Foreign Relations Committee\r\nhad jurisdiction; but after the Panama route was decided on, it\r\nbecame necessary to negotiate with Colombia, the owner of that\r\nroute, for the right of way for the canal.  Secretary Hay promptly\r\nproceeded with the negotiation, as it was his duty to do, under\r\nthe Spooner Act, and on January 3, 1903, submitted the treaty to\r\nthe Senate for its Constitutional action thereon.  Senator Morgan\r\nand others led the fight against it; but a vote was taken, and the\r\ntreaty was ordered favorably reported.  On February 12, 1903, I\r\ncalled it up in the Senate and made quite an extended speech,\r\nexplaining its provisions, and urging its ratification.  The session\r\nwas to close on March 4, and it finally became manifest that it\r\nwould be hopeless to attempt to ratify it before that day, and the\r\neffort was abandoned.  President Roosevelt called a special session\r\nof the Senate after the fourth of March, when there would be nothing\r\nfor the Senate to consider except the Colombian treaty and other\r\nexecutive matters.  According to the usual rule, the treaty was\r\nreferred back to the committee, at the beginning of the special\r\nsession, and the subject was again gone over in committee as if\r\nthere had been no proceedings on it at all during the regular\r\nsession.  The proposed agreement was finally reported to the Senate,\r\nand ratified.  There is no need for me to go over the story of its\r\nrejection by Colombia.  The action of the Colombian Congress was\r\na hold-up pure and simple, and the treaty was rejected in the hope\r\nthat the United States would offer a greater amount for the right-\r\nof-way.  Panama promptly seceded, which she had a perfect right to\r\ndo.  Many people have charged that the Roosevelt Administration\r\nactually incited the revolution.  Whether this is true or not, I\r\ndo not know.  I contended at the time, and still believe, that it\r\nis not true.  I hope it is not; but the correspondence did show\r\nthat the State Department had pretty close knowledge of events\r\nwhich were occurring on the Isthmus, and had seen to it that there\r\nwas a sufficient naval force in the vicinity \"to protect American\r\ninterests.\"  It was a remarkable revolution--I think the most\r\nremarkable I have ever read of in history.  It was practically\r\nbloodless.  One or two shots were fired, a Chinaman was killed,\r\nand yet a new and independent republic entered the family of\r\nNations.\r\n\r\nWe were able to make with Panama a much more satisfactory treaty\r\nthan we had with Colombia.  Senator Morgan this time was assisted\r\nby most of his Democratic colleagues; he denounced the treaty and\r\nmade all sorts of charges against the Administration; but after\r\nnumerous long sessions of the Committee on Foreign Relations, I\r\nwas authorized to report it to the Senate with certain minor\r\namendments, which, in my opening speech, I asked the Senate to\r\nreject, and to ratify the treaty without amendment.  I did this at\r\nthe earnest insistence of the State Department.  And, in addition,\r\nI did not think that the amendments were of such importance as\r\nwould justify resubmitting the treaty to Panama after that little\r\ncountry had once ratified it.  The State Department was led to this\r\naction by the receipt of the following cable from Mr. Buchanan,\r\nthe first Minister of the United States to Panama:\r\n\r\n  \"Panama, _January 22, 1904_.\r\n\r\n\"Hay, Washington:\r\n\r\n\"I can not refrain from referring to my belief that no amendment\r\nto the treaty should be made.  The delimitation of Panama and Colon\r\ninvolves several things which can only be satisfactorily adjusted\r\non the ground by joint action.  There are several other points in\r\nthe treaty which will require a mutual working agreement, or\r\nregulation, including sanitation.  While the treaty covers broadly\r\nall these things, my observation here is that the details of\r\ndevelopment of the authority conferred by the treaty in these\r\nregards can not be satisfactorily carried out by amendments, but\r\nshould be done through a mutually agreed upon regulation or\r\nunderstanding reached here on the ground between the two countries.\r\nThe executive power here can secure for the convention ample\r\nauthority to do such things without their being referred to the\r\nconvention hereafter.  Would it not be possible and best to adopt\r\nthis course with these amendments to the treaty; will bring up here\r\nmuch discussion of many articles which can all be avoided and our\r\npurpose gained by above course.  Any time when any specific grants\r\nof land or power not implied in the treaty is desired, it appears\r\nto me the wise course to take will be to do this by a supplemental\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n  \"(Signed) Buchanan.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Hay showed the most eager anxiety to have the treaty\r\nratified as it stood, and he wrote me quite a lengthy letter on\r\nthe subject, which I now feel at liberty to quote.\r\n\r\n  \"Department of State, Washington.\r\n  \"_January 20, 1904_.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Senator Cullom:--\r\n\r\n\"I enclose a copy of a letter from the Panama Minister which he\r\nsent me last night.  He, as well as Mr. Buchanan, who is on the\r\nground, is greatly disturbed over the possible complications which\r\nmay arise if amendments are added to the treaty in the Senate.  Of\r\ncourse, I need not say nobody questions the right of the Senate to\r\namend the treaty as may seem to them best.  I am only speaking of\r\nthe matter of opportuneness and expediency.  We insisted on an\r\nimmediate ratification of the treaty by the Panama Government, and\r\nthey acceded to our wishes.  If we now, after a very long delay,\r\nsend the treaty back to them amended, you can at once imagine the\r\nstate of things that it will find there.  The moment of unanimity\r\nand enthusiasm, which only comes once in the life of a revolution,\r\nwill have passed away and given way to the play of politics and\r\nfactions.  They will have a certain advantage which they have not\r\nhad before in dealing with the matter.  We shall have ratified the\r\ntreaty with amendments, which gives them another chance to revise\r\ntheir perhaps hasty and enthusiastic action.  They will consider\r\nthemselves as entitled to make amendments as well as we, and it\r\nneeds only a glance at the treaty to show what an infinite field\r\nof amendments there is from every point of view.  The Junta in\r\nmaking their report to the present Constitutional Convention said\r\nthat, although many of the provisions seemed harsh and hard, yet\r\nit was judged for the public good to accept it as it was.  When\r\nthey get the amended treaty in their hands again, they will compare\r\nit with the treaty we made with Colombia, and see how vastly more\r\nadvantageous to us this treaty is than that one was, and there are\r\nnever lacking in a body of men like the Constitutional Convention\r\na plenty of members who like to distinguish themselves by defending\r\nthe interests of their country through the advantageous amendment\r\nof a treaty.  Meanwhile the country will be open to the intrigues\r\nof the Colombians, and even to the military attacks upon the\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\n\"All these considerations would, of course, have no weight whatever\r\nif the amendments were vital to our interests, but, as I said to\r\nyou yesterday, it was the opinion of all of us who have studied\r\nthe matter that every point made by the amendments was intended to\r\nbe covered--I do not say how successfully--by the provisions of\r\nthe treaty itself.  This letter of Mr. Varilla's shows that the\r\nintentions of each Government were thoroughly understood by the\r\nother, exactly in the sense of the amendments now proposed.  I\r\nearnestly hope that our friends in the Senate may see the strength\r\nof our present position if the treaty is ratified without amendment,\r\nand the certain complications that will arise if, after a long\r\ndebate here, the treaty is put once more in the hands of the Panamans\r\nfor reconsideration and amendment.\r\n\r\n\"If the object of the amendments, as some people say, is to get it\r\nratified by the new permanent Government, nothing is easier.  I\r\nhave no doubt we can have a solemn resolution of that sort adopted\r\nby the Convention at any time.\r\n\r\n  \"Very sincerely yours,\r\n  \"John Hay.\r\n\r\n\"The Honorable S. M. Cullom,\r\n  \"United States Senate.\"\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a month and a half of debate in executive session,\r\ndevoted to its consideration, the treaty was finally ratified\r\nwithout amendment.\r\n\r\nConsiderable discussion arose over the question of the recognition\r\nof Panama and the right of that country to make the treaty at all.\r\nI contended in the Senate, in open as well as executive session,\r\nthat the new Republic of Panama had a perfect right to make the\r\ntreaty with the United States because it was a complete, sovereign,\r\nand independent State.  The recognition given the new Government\r\nwas the highest recognition we could accord.  It was not a recognition\r\nof belligerency, which is only a recognition that war exists; it\r\nwas not a virtual recognition, which is a recognition only for\r\ncommercial purposes; but it was what Pomeroy and Fillmore define\r\nto be a formal recognition--that is, an absolute recognition of\r\nindependence and sovereignty.  The recognition of the Republic was\r\na complete and formal recognition of independence, because the\r\nPresident had received an envoy-extraordinary and minister-\r\nplenipotentiary from that State.  The United States Senate was a\r\nparty to that complete and formal recognition, because we confirmed\r\nthe nomination of Mr. Buchanan as envoy-extraordinary and minister-\r\nplenipotentiary to that country.\r\n\r\nThis ended the long fight over the construction of the Panama Canal\r\n--at least, so far as it in any way involved the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.  With the ratification of the\r\ntreaty, the subject was transferred to the Committee on Interoceanic\r\ncanals, where, during every session, matters of more or less\r\nimportance connected with the canal are considered.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether or not it was wise to change from the Nicaraguan\r\nto the Panama route.  Senator Hanna and Senator Spooner were\r\nresponsible for the change; and time alone will demonstrate whether\r\nwe acted wisely.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\nSANTO DOMINGO'S FISCAL AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nFor some years the Santo Domingo protocol and treaty were before\r\nthe Committee on Foreign Relations, and in the Senate.  They came\r\nbefore the Senate very suddenly.  On January 20, 1905, there appeared\r\nin the press what purported to be a protocol, agreed to by Commander\r\nDillingham on the one hand, and Minister Sanchez of the Dominican\r\nRepublic on the other, by the terms of which the United States was\r\nto take charge of the custom houses of the Dominican Republic,\r\nadjust and liquidate its debt, and generally to take charge of the\r\nfiscal affairs of the Republic.  By the terms of this protocol, it\r\nwas to go into effect February 1, and there was no provision at\r\nall for Senatorial action.  Senator Bacon and other Democratic\r\nSenators became very much aroused over this as a usurpation of the\r\nrights of the Senate.  Resolutions were introduced, calling upon\r\nthe State Department for information, and the subject was considered\r\nby the committee at several meetings.\r\n\r\nI confess that I too was considerably surprised at the action of\r\nthe State Department, and I called on Secretary Hay one morning\r\nand asked to be informed as to the facts.\r\n\r\nSecretary Hay stated that he would communicate with me in writing,\r\nwhich he did on March 13, 1905, saying:\r\n\r\n\"In answer to your verbal request, I submit herewith a statement\r\nof the facts with reference to the making of the Santo Domingo\r\nprotocol, and enclose herewith a copy of the protocol of January\r\n20, 1905.  That protocol was not drawn up by the Department of\r\nState and was never seen by any of its officials until it appeared\r\nin the newspapers on January 22d last, as given out by the Dominican\r\nofficials.  The Department has never authorized its signing; it\r\nnever gave any instructions authorizing its signature; and no full\r\npowers had ever been given authorizing the signature on the part\r\nof the United States Government.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nof the Dominican Republic visited Washington during the Spring of\r\n1904, and during a stay of nearly three months repeatedly solicited\r\nthe assistance of the United States Government for the restoration\r\nof order in the island and for the regeneration of his country,\r\nbut the responsible officials of the Department advised against\r\nmeeting his request, and the President, to whom the matter was\r\nreferred, decided against taking any action as long as it could\r\nwisely be avoided.\r\n\r\n\"The Dominican Government again brought the matter to the attention\r\nof the United States Minister at Santo Domingo the latter part of\r\n1904.  In the meantime an investigation had been going on quietly\r\nby our Government through Commander Dillingham, to obtain information\r\nas to the real condition in the island.  After the President became\r\nthus familiar with the situation there, and on the report of the\r\nUnited States Minister, and after repeated requests for help from\r\nthe Dominican Government, the Department of State, on January 6,\r\n1905, prepared a cablegram setting forth the basis on which alone\r\nthe United States would be able to render assistance. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Neither that cablegram nor any other despatch whatsoever went\r\nfurther than simply lay down a basis; and acting on this, but\r\nwithout instructions authorizing it, the Dillingham-Sanchez protocol\r\nwas signed.  The Department was advised by cable on January 20 that\r\nan arrangement had been agreed to, and thereupon the Department\r\nofficials at once set to work to prepare a treaty; and its officials\r\nwere actually engaged in drafting one to send to Santo Domingo,\r\nwhen the publication of the protocol of January 20 appeared.  The\r\nDepartment at once cabled to Santo Domingo to forward a copy of\r\nthe protocol; and as soon as its text could be received, the\r\nDepartment began work in making amendments and adjusting terms on\r\nwhich the United States Government could consent to act.  As soon\r\nas the two Governments could arrive at substantial agreement as to\r\nthe terms, full powers were communicated to Dawson, and the protocol\r\nnow before the Senate was accordingly signed.\r\n\r\n\"In view of the misapprehensions that at once arose, growing out\r\nof publication of the protocol, which upon its face stated it was\r\nto go into effect February 1st, and from which it might naturally\r\nbe inferred it was intended to go into effect before the Senate\r\ncould have an opportunity to consider it, and without its having\r\nbeen referred to the Senate for consideration, I considered the\r\nquestion of the propriety of stating the fact that no instructions\r\nand no powers had ever been granted authorizing the signing of the\r\nprotocol of January 20.  The decision was reached that repudiation\r\nof the action of Dillingham and Dawson might be construed as a\r\ncensure, and that it might cause offence to them as well as to\r\ntheir friends, who might feel that when the circumstances should\r\nbecome fully known, that Dillingham and Dawson were justifiable in\r\nassuming the responsibility they did in signing the protocol instead\r\nof making a formal memorandum of the basis agreed on and communicating\r\nit to the Department for the drafting of a treaty.  Both of these\r\nofficials have a record of faithful and skilful service and\r\ncompetency, and it was hoped when the facts should become more\r\nfully known, a correct understanding of the actual situation would\r\nremove any ill effects of previous misapprehension.\r\n\r\n\"The department has been advised that the protocol of January 20\r\nwas given out for publication by the Dominican Government in order\r\nto calm the popular mind on account of its uncertainty as to the\r\ncharacter of negotiations which were actually being carried on\r\nbetween the two Governments.\r\n\r\n  \"(Signed) John Hay.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1865, until the time that the United States assumed the\r\ncollection of customs, conditions in Santo Domingo were about as\r\nbad as they could be in every respect.  One revolution succeeded\r\nanother.  There had been twenty-six different Administrations since\r\n1865, only one of which was brought about by means of a regular\r\nelection.  Most of the others were caused by revolutions, assassination,\r\nforced resignations, and a general condition of anarchy.  Debt\r\nafter debt, bond issue after bond issue, piled up, each Administration\r\nseemingly bent only on seeing how much actual cash could be raised,\r\nutterly regardless of obligations assumed.  None of the principal\r\nand only a trifling portion of the interest were paid, and it seems\r\nthat the different Administrations never had any intention of\r\nliquidating the obligations of the Republic.  The principal portion\r\nof the bonds was held by European creditors.\r\n\r\nBut finally the Santo Domingo Improvement Company, an American\r\ncorporation, succeeded as the fiscal agents of the Republic, to\r\nfloat its bond issues.  The improvement company was displayed, and\r\nits claim was settled for four million, five hundred thousand\r\ndollars.  Then a protocol was entered into between the United States\r\nand Santo Domingo by which the manner of payment was submitted to\r\narbitration, our arbitrators being Judge George Gray and John G.\r\nCarlisle.  An award was rendered providing that an agent of the\r\nUnited States should take possession of certain custom houses, in\r\norder to pay a debt which the Government of Santo Domingo had\r\nacknowledged to be due an American corporation.\r\n\r\nThis did not satisfy foreign creditors, French, Belgian and Italian,\r\nwho had actually been given, by an agreement with Santo Domingo,\r\nthe right to collect revenues at certain custom houses.  Santo\r\nDomingo appealed to the United States and the foreign Governments\r\nthreatened that if the United States did not enforce some remedial\r\nplan, they would be compelled to take action for the relief of\r\ntheir own citizens, whose claims aggregated twenty million dollars.\r\nItalian warships were already in Santo Domingo waters ready to\r\nenforce their demands.  This, briefly, was the condition of affairs\r\nwhen the protocol of 1905 was submitted to the Senate for\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nFor more than a quarter of a century we have had a peculiar interest\r\nin Santo Domingo.  As is well known, under the Administration of\r\nPresident Grant a treaty was negotiated and sent to the Senate\r\nproviding for the annexation of Santo Domingo.  Senator Sumner was\r\nChairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, and as such was\r\nable to prevent the consideration of the treaty by the committee,\r\nand its ratification by the Senate.  Some one said that the only\r\nobjection that Charles Sumner had to the treaty was that President\r\nGrant had suggested it first.  This was one of the reasons why\r\nSenator Sumner was deposed as chairman of the Foreign Relations\r\nCommittee.  It would probably have been better for the United\r\nStates, and it certainly would have been better for the Dominican\r\nRepublic, if the treaty had been ratified.\r\n\r\nThe protocol submitted to the Senate involved very large responsibilities\r\non the part of the United states.  It provided that the United\r\nStates was to adjust all the obligations of the Republic, the\r\narrangement of the payment, to pass upon all claims of Santo Domingo,\r\ndetermine their amount and validity, take charge of all the custom\r\nhouses, and collect and disburse the customs receipts, giving to\r\nSanto Domingo forty-five per cent of the customs receipts and\r\ndevoting the balance to the liquidation of her debts.\r\n\r\nThis protocol had the active opposition of the minority of the\r\ncommittee and in the Senate and, in addition, such conservative\r\nmembers as Senator Hale and other prominent Republicans opposed\r\nit.  We fought over it in committee month after month; but finally,\r\non March 10, 1905, it was reported by me to the Senate with a large\r\nnumber of amendments.  It was considered by the Senate, recommitted\r\nat the end of the Congress, and again reported at the following\r\nCongress.  But those in favor of it became convinced that we did\r\nnot have the two-thirds necessary to ratify it, and it was never\r\nbrought to a vote.  It was thought that nothing more would be heard\r\nof the Santo Domingo protocol; but Senator Root, when Secretary of\r\nState, took the subject up _de novo_, and made a new treaty, in\r\nwhich the United States did not assume the broad obligations it\r\nassumed under the first one, and which was not generally of so\r\ncomplicated a character.\r\n\r\nIt imposed the duty upon the Santo Domingo Republic itself of\r\narriving at an adjustment with its creditors, conditioned only on\r\nthe administration of the custom houses by the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, an arrangement was made by American banking houses\r\nto furnish the money to liquidate the debt; the creditors were\r\nsatisfied; the foreign debt was liquidated on a basis of fifty per\r\ncent of the face value, and domestic debts and other claims less\r\nthan ten per cent.  A loan of twenty million dollars was made\r\nthrough Kuhn, Loeb & Company, of which the Dominican Republic\r\nreceived nineteen million dollars for the payment of its debts;\r\nseventeen million dollars was used to satisfy thirty-one million,\r\neight thousand dollars worth of bonded debts, and the remaining\r\ntwo million, two thousand dollars were to go for internal\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nThere was some objection to the ratification of the treaty negotiated\r\nby Secretary Root, but not of a very serious character, and the\r\ntreaty went through, even Senator Morgan not opposing it.  I had\r\nthe honor of reporting it and having charge of it in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe treaty has now been in force several years, and it has proved\r\neven more advantageous than was expected when it was ratified.  It\r\nhas restored order in the Republic, and the country's debts are\r\nrapidly being liquidated.  The time may come when the United States\r\nmay be compelled to take similar action with some of the other\r\nrepublics south of us.  Such action would be beneficial both to\r\nthe United States and to the people of those republics.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\nDIPLOMATIC AGREEMENTS BY PROTOCOL.\r\n\r\nDuring the public discussion of the Santo Domingo question and the\r\nprotocol by which the Santo Domingo Improvement Company claim was\r\nsent to arbitration, and later during the consideration of it,\r\nthere was criticism of the Executive branch of the Government on\r\naccount of its disposition to make international agreements of\r\nvarious kinds, and put them into operation without submitting them\r\nto the Senate.  The practice became more general under President\r\nMcKinley and Secretary Hay than it had under other Administrations,\r\nand it seemed the policy to get along in every case, if possible,\r\nwithout Senatorial action.  It was a subject in which I took very\r\ngreat interest; I came to the conclusion that the practice had\r\nbecome too general, and I took occasion to tell Secretary Hay my\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nI found that the State Department, under different Administrations,\r\nhad submitted private claims of our citizens against foreign\r\nGovernments to arbitration by protocol.  This has been the rule\r\nfrequently adopted for very many years.  There were cases, I found,\r\nwhere the protocol submitting a claim to arbitration had been sent\r\nto the Senate and ratified, and it was the general rule that where\r\na claim is presented by a foreign Government against this government,\r\nand the same is submitted to arbitration, it is done by treaty.\r\n\r\nI took occasion to look into the question of the effect of an\r\nunratified protocol.  It may be said generally that an unratified\r\nprotocol differs from a treaty in that the protocol is not ratified\r\nby the Senate and is not a part of the supreme law of the land.\r\nUnder our system of government, treaties occupy a unique position.\r\nThey are not only binding internationally, but the Constitution\r\nmakes treaties a part of the supreme law of the land--that is, a\r\npart of our own municipal law.  A treaty, if of later date, and in\r\nconflict with a law passed by Congress, repeals so much of the law\r\nas it conflicts with; but an unratified protocol, or any other\r\ninternational agreement, no matter by what name it is called, not\r\nsubmitted to the Senate, does not have the effect of a treaty, as\r\nthat term is defined in the Constitution.  A protocol is binding\r\nmerely on the Executive who makes it, and, as has been well said,\r\nsuch protocol is binding on the administration in a moral sense\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it has been the practice to make so-called diplomatic\r\nagreements concerning very important matters without their submission\r\nto the Senate.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the agreement of 1817, concerning the naval forces\r\non the Great Lakes, was considered in force and observed by the\r\ntwo Governments for a year or more before it was submitted to the\r\nSenate at all.  Horse Shoe Reef, in Lake Erie, was transferred to\r\nthe Government by a mere exchange of notes between Lord Palmerston\r\nand Mr. Lawrence, our Minister to Great Britain; and I might refer\r\nto a long list of arbitrations, some of very great importance,\r\nagreed to by unratified protocols.  The very important protocol\r\nconcluded by the powers after the Boxer troubles in China was not\r\nsent to the Senate.  Important agreements are often made under the\r\nname of _modus vivendi_ without submission to the Senate.\r\n\r\nVery little comment is to be found in books on international law\r\nconcerning protocols or diplomatic agreements.  There is no doubt\r\nthat the Executive has the right to enter into a protocol preliminary\r\nto the negotiation of a treaty.  This is a common practice.  We\r\nhave such protocols preliminary to treaties of peace.  As to the\r\nclaims protocols, the Executive Department has taken the position\r\nthat the President, who is in charge of our foreign relations, has\r\nwide discretion in settling disputes by diplomacy; and that a claims\r\nprotocol is in the nature of a settlement of a claim of a citizen\r\nof our country against a foreign Government, by diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe term \"protocol,\" or diplomatic agreement, or _modus vivendi_,\r\nis not found in the Constitution.  The Constitution uses only one\r\nterm in describing agreements between this Government and foreign\r\npowers, and that is the term \"treaty\"; and every agreement between\r\nthe United States and a foreign Government, to have the effect of\r\na treaty, to be a part of the supreme law of the land, must be\r\nratified as the Constitution prescribes, by a two-thirds vote of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Root entered the State Department, it seems to me that he\r\nstopped the practice very largely of making diplomatic agreements.\r\nIt seemed to be his policy, and a very wise one, to seek, rather\r\nthan avoid, consulting the Senate.  I know that under his administration\r\nagreements were made in the form of a treaty and sent to the Senate\r\nwhich other administrations would consider they had a perfect right\r\nto make without consulting the Senate.  It will be wise for future\r\nAdministrations to adhere to Mr. Root's policy in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\nARBITRATION\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1904, there was a great general movement all over\r\nthe world in the direction of arbitration treaties.  Indeed, so\r\ngeneral did it become, and so universal was the form used, that it\r\nbecame known as the Mondel or world treaty.  The treaties were very\r\nbrief, and merely provided that differences which may arise of a\r\nlegal nature or relating to the interpretation of treaties existing\r\nbetween two contracting parties, and which it may not have been\r\npossible to settle by diplomacy, shall be referred to the permanent\r\ncourt of arbitration established at The Hague; provided, nevertheless,\r\nthat they do not affect the vital interests, the independence, or\r\nthe honor of the two contracting States, and do not concern or\r\ninvolve the interests of third States.  There was a second article\r\nin the treaty, which provided that in each case a special agreement\r\nshould be concluded defining clearly the matter in dispute, the\r\nscope of the powers of the arbitrator, the periods to be fixed for\r\nthe formation of the arbitral tribunal, and the several stages of\r\nthe procedure.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt and Secretary Hay were very much in favor of\r\nthese treaties, and sent to the Senate, for its ratification,\r\ntreaties in substantially the foregoing form, with France, Portugal,\r\nGreat Britain, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria, Sweden,\r\nNorway, and Mexico.  The treaties were considered with great care\r\nby the Committee on Foreign Relations.  We all favored arbitration\r\nin theory, and I do not think any one wanted to oppose the treaties;\r\nbut a number of questions confronted us.  I neither have the right\r\nnor do I expect to detail what has taken place in the Committee on\r\nForeign Relations; but I can say that the subject was discussed in\r\nthe press, whether such treaties would not compel us to consider\r\nas matters for arbitration claims against the States, growing out\r\nof the Civil War and Reconstruction.\r\n\r\nIn the judgment of some, such claims were proper subjects of\r\narbitration under this Mondel form of treaty.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt, who was following closely the treaties in the\r\nSenate, and with whom I had talked concerning these objections,\r\nwrote me a letter, which he marked personal, but which appeared in\r\nthe afternoon papers almost before the letter reached me, it having\r\nbeen given out at the White House, in which he said:\r\n\r\n  \"_January 10, 1905_.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Senator Cullom:\r\n\r\n\"I notice in connection with the general arbitration treaties now\r\nbefore the Senate, that suggestions have been made to the effect\r\nthat under them it might be possible to consider as matters for\r\narbitration claims against certain States of the Union in reference\r\nto certain State debts.  I write to say, what of course you personally\r\nknow, that under no conceivable circumstances could any such\r\nconstruction of the treaty be for a moment entertained by any\r\nPresident.  The holders of State debts take them with full knowledge\r\nof the Constitutional limitations upon their recovery through any\r\naction of the National Government, and must rely solely on State\r\ncredit.  Such a claim against a State could under no condition be\r\nsubmitted by the general Government as a matter for arbitration,\r\nany more than such a claim against a county or municipality could\r\nthus be submitted for arbitration.  The objection to the proposed\r\namendment on the subject is that it is a mere matter of surplusage,\r\nand that it is very undesirable, when the form of these treaties\r\nhas already been agreed to by the several Powers concerned, needlessly\r\nto add certain definitions which affect our own internal policy\r\nonly; which deal with the matter of the relation of the Federal\r\nGovernment to the States which it is of course out of the question\r\never to submit to the arbitration of any outside tribunal; and\r\nwhich it is certainly absurd and probably mischievous to treat as\r\npossible to be raised by the President or by any foreign power.\r\nNo one would even think of such a matter as being one for arbitration\r\nor for any diplomatic negotiation whatever.  Moreover, these treaties\r\nrun only for a term of five years; until the end of that period\r\nthey will certainly be interpreted in accordance with the view\r\nabove expressed.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"(Signed) Theodore Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n\"Hon S. M. Cullom, U. S. Senate.\"\r\n\r\nBut a more serious question was met when we came to consider the\r\nsecond article of the treaty, which provided that in each case a\r\nspecial agreement should be made defining clearly the matter in\r\ndispute, the scope and powers of the arbitrators, and the periods\r\nto be fixed for the formation of the arbitral tribunal.  The\r\ndifficulty confronting us was whether it was the intention to submit\r\nthe special agreements referred to in article two for the ratification\r\nof the Senate.  It was the unanimous opinion that these special\r\nagreements should be submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nI believe that as the treaties were drafted it would be the\r\nConstitutional duty of the President to have each special agreement\r\nsubmitted for ratification, because the article provided that \"the\r\nhigh contracting parties shall conclude such special agreement.\"\r\nThe Senate is a part of the treaty-making power, and would be\r\nincluded in the term \"high contracting parties.\"  But the wording\r\nof article two left some doubt as to the intention of those\r\nnegotiating the treaty; and then, again, it might have been claimed\r\nthat article one, agreeing to arbitrate the questions therein\r\nenumerated, might be construed as an agreement in advance on the\r\npart of the Senate, to give to the Executive the general power to\r\nmake arbitration agreements without reference to the Senate.  Of\r\ncourse, the Senate, even if it so desired, could not thus delegate\r\nthe treaty-making power to the Executive alone.\r\n\r\nThere was so much difference of opinion that I took occasion to\r\nsubmit the question to both President Roosevelt and Secretary Hay,\r\nwhether it was the intention on the part of the executive department\r\nto send these special agreements to the Senate for ratification.\r\nThey both replied that it was not; that one of the purposes of the\r\nExecutive in making the treaties was to enable the Administration\r\nto go ahead and make the special agreements without consulting the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it was almost the unanimous judgment of\r\nthe Senate that the treaties should be amended by striking out the\r\nwords \"special agreement\": and substituting the word \"treaty,\" a\r\nConstitutional term about which there could be no doubt.  I considered\r\nat the time that the declaration and agreement contained in these\r\ntreaties in favor of arbitration were just as strong, just as broad,\r\nand just as obligatory with the proposed amendment as without it.\r\nIt was an agreement on the part of the President and Senate that\r\nthe President and Senate, the treaty-making power, would submit\r\ndifferences to arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe Senate was severely criticised at the time for being too\r\ntechnical and standing in the way of arbitration; but in my judgment\r\nit was not a trifling question.  It could not be put aside.  Even\r\nif the amendment had not been adopted, the President, if he followed\r\nthe Constitution, should have submitted these special agreements\r\nto the Senate for ratification; but he took the positive stand that\r\nhe would not submit them, and nothing remained for the Senate to\r\ndo but to assert and uphold its rights as a part of the treaty-\r\nmaking power, and adopt the amendment to which I have referred.\r\n\r\nI do not think I violate any of the rules of etiquette by quoting\r\nhere President Roosevelt's letter written to me after he had learned,\r\nthrough the press, that the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations\r\nhad amended the treaties.\r\n\r\n  \"White House, Washington,\r\n  \"_February 10, 1905_.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Senator Cullom:\r\n\r\n\"I learn that the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has reported\r\nthe arbitration treaties to the Senate, amending them by substituting\r\nfor the word 'agreement' in the second article the word 'treaty.'\r\nThe effect of the amendment is to make it no longer possible, as\r\nbetween its contracting parties, to submit any matter whatever to\r\narbitration without first obtaining a special treaty to cover the\r\ncase.  This will represent not a step forward but a step backward.\r\nIf the word 'agreement' were retained it will be possible for the\r\nDepartment of State to do as, for instance, it has already done\r\nunder The Hague treaty in the Pious Fund arbitration case with\r\nMexico, and submit to arbitration such subordinate matters as by\r\ntreaty the Senate had decided could be left to the Executive to\r\nsubmit under a jurisdiction limited by the general treaty of\r\narbitration.  If the word 'treaty' be substituted the result is\r\nthat every such agreement must be submitted to the Senate; and\r\nthese general arbitration treaties would then cease to be such,\r\nand indeed in their amended form they amount to a specific\r\npronouncement against the whole principle of a general arbitration\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\n\"The Senate has, of course, the absolute right to reject or to\r\namend in any way it sees fit any treaty laid before it, and it is\r\nclearly the duty of the Senate to take any step which, in the\r\nexercise of its best judgment, it deems to be for the interest of\r\nthe Nation.  If, however, in the judgment of the President a given\r\namendment nullifies a proposed treaty it seems to me that it is no\r\nless clearly his duty to refrain from endeavoring to secure a\r\nratification by the other contracting power or powers, of the\r\namended treaty; and after much thought I have come to the conclusion\r\nthat I ought to write and tell you that such is my judgment in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\"As amended, we would have a treaty of arbitration which in effect\r\nwill do nothing but recite that this Government will when it deems\r\nit wise hereafter enter into treaties of arbitration.  Inasmuch as\r\nwe, of course, now have the power to enter into any treaties of\r\narbitration, and inasmuch as to pass these amended treaties does\r\nnot in the smallest degree facilitate settlements by arbitration,\r\nto make them would in no way further the cause of international\r\npeace.  It would not, in my judgment, be wise or expedient to try\r\nto secure the assent of the other contracting powers to the amended\r\ntreaties, for even if such consent were secured we would still\r\nremain precisely where we were before, save where the situation\r\nmay be changed a little for the worse.  There would not even be\r\nthe slight benefit that might obtain from the more general statement\r\nthat we intend hereafter, when we can come to an agreement with\r\nforeign powers as to what shall be submitted, to enter into\r\narbitration treaties; for we have already, when we ratified The\r\nHague treaty with the various signatory powers, solemnly declared\r\nsuch to be our intention; and nothing is gained by reiterating our\r\nadherence to the principle, while refusing to provide any means of\r\nmaking our intention effectual.  In the amended form the treaties\r\ncontain nothing except such expression of barren intention, and\r\nindeed, as compared with what has already been provided in The\r\nHague arbitration treaty, they probably represent not a step forward\r\nbut a slight step backward, as regards the question of international\r\narbitration.  As such I do not think they should receive the sanction\r\nof this Government.  Personally it is not my opinion that this\r\nGovernment lacks the power to enter into general treaties of\r\narbitration, but if I am in error, and if this Government has no\r\npower to enter into such general treaties, then it seems to me that\r\nit is better not to attempt to make them, rather than to make the\r\nattempt in such shape that they will accomplish literally nothing\r\nwhatever when made.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely yours,\r\n  \"(Signed) Theodore Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. S. M. Cullom, U. S. Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was read to the Senate, and notwithstanding the positive\r\ndeclaration by Mr. Roosevelt that he would not ask any of the\r\nforeign Governments to consent to the amendment made by the Senate,\r\nthe treaties were amended and ratified by the Senate.\r\n\r\nI told the President in advance of the action of the Senate what\r\nwould be done, and he rather curtly remarked that the matter was\r\nclosed, and that he would not ask the other Governments to agree\r\nto the treaties as amended.  And no further action was taken on\r\nthe treaties.\r\n\r\nWhen Secretary Root entered the State Department he took an entirely\r\ndifferent view of the subject.  I do not know whether Mr. Root was\r\nof the opinion that the Senate was right in insisting on what it\r\nconsidered to be its duty in amending the treaties, but I do know\r\nthat he negotiated arbitration treaties with Austria, China, Costa\r\nRica, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Haiti, Italy, Japan, Mexico,\r\nThe Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Salvador, Spain,\r\nSweden, and Switzerland, every one of which treaties contained the\r\nstipulation that the special agreements referred to in article two\r\nwere to be made by the President of the United States, by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate.  These treaties were promptly\r\nratified and are a part of the supreme law of the land to-day.\r\n\r\nSecretary Root was very wise in negotiating and sending to the\r\nSenate this series of Mondel or world treaties.  All the Nations\r\nof the world were agreeing to these treaties among themselves, and\r\nit would have been a rather remarkable condition if the United\r\nStates, of all the great Nations, should have remained aloof.  I\r\ndo not believe that Mr. Root had any difficulty in obtaining the\r\nconsent of the signatory powers to the treaties, with the stipulation\r\nthat the special agreement should come to the Senate for ratification;\r\nbut for some reason or other, at the time when the first treaties\r\nwere under consideration, President Roosevelt, as indicated in the\r\nletter which I have quoted, and probably more particularly Secretary\r\nHay, were both very much incensed at the action of the Senate, and\r\npermitted the first treaties to expire.\r\n\r\nThis general movement in the direction of arbitration was one of\r\nthe most important events of the beginning of the twentieth century.\r\nThe importance of the adoption of this principle by the Nations of\r\nthe world cannot be overestimated.  It has been well said that\r\ninternational arbitration is the application of law and of judicial\r\nmethods to the determination of disputes between Nations, and that\r\nthis juristic idea in the settlement of international disputes is\r\nlargely an outgrowth of the international relations, the new and\r\nadvanced civilization of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nI do not believe the time will ever come when wars will cease,--\r\nthe United States obtained its independence by means of a revolution\r\nand war; but peace and arbitration have been advocated by the great\r\nmajority of the enlightened statesmen of the world.  There were\r\nmany great wars during the nineteenth century, including our own\r\nCivil War, the greatest, the bloodiest, recorded in all history;\r\nbut during this century arbitration has made wonderful strides.\r\nIn the same period there were four hundred and seventy-one instances\r\nof international settlements involving the application of the\r\nprinciple of international arbitration.  Many of these arbitrations\r\nwere of the greatest importance; and I remark here that in the\r\nnumber of arbitrations and the importance of the questions involved,\r\nthe United States and Great Britain have unquestionably led the\r\nway.  In fact, since the War of 1812, every subject of dispute\r\nbetween the two Nations, which it was found impossible to settle\r\nby diplomacy, has been submitted to arbitration.  Only within a\r\nfew years the Alaskan boundary was settled by arbitration, and\r\nwithin the past year a fisheries dispute, a cause of embarrassment\r\nsince 1818, was submitted to The Hague tribunal and a decision\r\nrendered, which, though not entirely satisfactory to the United\r\nStates, we accepted as the final settlement.\r\n\r\nWe have uniformly adopted arbitration as a means of settlement for\r\ndisputes with the Central and South American Republics.  With Mexico\r\nthe treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, of 1848, stipulates that future\r\ndisputes between the two republics shall be submitted to arbitration.\r\nWe have a general arbitration treaty for the settlement of pecuniary\r\nclaims with all the Central and South American Republics.  At the\r\nfirst Hague Conference, which met in 1899, a general arbitration\r\ntreaty was agreed to.  It was a non-compulsory arbitration, and at\r\nthe time represented the farthest steps in advance in the direction\r\nof arbitration which all the Nations were willing to take together.\r\nThat treaty was perfected at the second Hague Conference of 1907;\r\nand, in addition, a series of treaties were agreed to concerning\r\nthe opening of hostilities, the laws and customs of war on land,\r\nthe rights and duties of neutrals, submarine contact mines,\r\nbombardment by naval forces, the right of capture in naval war,\r\nneutral powers in naval war, an international prize court, and the\r\ndischarge of projectiles from balloons, and the Geneva Convention\r\nwas revised.  Aside from the prize court treaty, concerning which\r\nthere were Constitutional objections, these treaties were ratified\r\nby the Senate, the United States being one of the first Nations of\r\nthe world to take this step.  Unlike the first Hague Conference,\r\nthe South American Republics participated in the Second Conference,\r\nand it was the first time in all the world's history that the\r\nrepresentatives of all the independent Nations in the world gathered\r\ntogether in the interest of peace and agreed on certain principles\r\nwhich should guide them in the conduct of war, if war must come.\r\n\r\nI take pride in the fact that the treaties agreed to at the first\r\nHague Conference, and the treaties agreed to at the second Hague\r\nConference, and the series of Mondel treaties, were reported from\r\nthe Committee on Foreign Relations, and ratified by the Senate\r\nduring my chairmanship of the Committee on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\nThe last step to date in the interest of the peaceful settlement\r\nof international disputes has been taken by President Taft in the\r\narbitration treaties between the United States and Great Britain\r\nand between the United States and France, both of which were signed\r\nby the representatives of this and the other two Governments in\r\nAugust, 1911.  The ban of secrecy has been removed from these\r\ndocuments, and I feel at liberty to make brief mention of them,\r\nalthough, as they still are pending in the Senate, I should not\r\nfeel disposed to discuss them at length.  The treaties mark an\r\nadvance over the arbitration treaties of 1908 in that they bring\r\ninto arbitration a much wider range of subjects than is covered by\r\nthe older conventions.  In the latter, questions of \"national\r\nhonor,\" \"vital interest,\" etc., were excluded from consideration,\r\nwhereas, under the pending agreements, \"all differences which are\r\njusticiable in their nature by reason of being susceptible of\r\ndecision by the application of the principles of law and equity,\"\r\nare made subject to arbitration under the rules laid down in the\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nThere also is a provision granting to the Commission created by\r\nthe treaties the right to determine whether any given question\r\npresented to it may be considered justiciable under the language\r\nof the treaties.  This latter provision is regarded by the President\r\nand Secretary Knox as highly desirable in the interest of the\r\nexpedition of business, but it met such opposition in the Committee\r\non Foreign Relations that its elimination from the treaties was\r\nrecommended to the Senate.  The objection to the provision is based\r\nupon the theory that it would deprive the Senate of its constitutional\r\nright to pass upon all treaties.  I have not accepted this view,\r\nbecause I do not believe in hampering working bodies when such a\r\ncourse can be avoided without doing violence to the fundamental\r\nlaw as I believe in this case it can be.\r\n\r\nWith this provision expunged, the Committee is largely favorable\r\nto the treaties, and they are now pending in the Senate.  It,\r\nhowever, has become evident that they cannot be speedily acted\r\nupon, and as I write, in the closing days of the special session,\r\ncalled at the beginning of the Sixty-second Congress, the indications\r\nare strong that they will be compelled to go over to the regular\r\nsession in December for final consideration.  What their fate then\r\nmay be no one can foretell.\r\n\r\nIt is well understood that if these treaties should be ratified\r\nthey will be followed by similar agreements with the other civilized\r\nnations of the world.  The spirit of arbitration has taken strong\r\nhold on our big-hearted and peace-loving President, and I am\r\nconfident that he will leave no stone unturned to promote good will\r\namong nations as he is wont to do among men.  Whatever differences\r\nof opinion there may be, regarding the details of any particular\r\nnegotiation, no person of whatever party or creed can doubt President\r\nTaft's splendid patriotism and devotion to the highest ideals of\r\ncitizenship.  I am sure that these treaties have been inspired by\r\nthese sentiments, and, being honest and benevolent in their purpose,\r\nthe principle they embody must prevail in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\nTITLES AND DECORATIONS FROM FOREIGN POWERS\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States provides:\r\n\r\n\"No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States, and\r\nno person holding any office of profit or trust under them shall,\r\nwithout the consent of Congress, accept of any present, emolument,\r\noffice, or title of any kind whatever from any king, prince, or\r\nforeign State.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I became chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, there\r\nwere numerous bills pending, and numerous requests submitted through\r\nthe State Department, for authority, on the part of officers of\r\nthe United States, to accept gifts and decorations from foreign\r\nGovernments.  At first I was disposed to consent to the report and\r\npassage of such bills, and during the first year or two they were\r\nreported from the committee from time to time and passed in the\r\nSenate.  The House did not act upon the individual bills, but a so-\r\ncalled \"omnibus bill\" was passed in the House containing all the\r\nbills that previously had been passed by the Senate, and in addition\r\nquite a number of House bills.  I had not realized until then how\r\nextensive the practice had become, and I thereupon determined to\r\nuse what influence I had to put a stop to it.  Since then but two\r\ndecorative bills of an exceptionally meritorious nature, one in\r\nfavor of Captain T. deWitt Wilcox, and one in favor of Admiral B.\r\nH. McCalla, have been enacted by Congress.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly disapprove of the practice, and wanted to put an\r\neffectual stop to it.  At the same time the requests came pouring\r\nin from session to session, and certain Senators, both on the\r\ncommittee and others who were not members of it, insisted and urged\r\nthat favorable action be taken in behalf of officers of the United\r\nStates in whom they were interested.  After more than two hundred\r\nrequests had accumulated, I determined to appoint a subcommittee\r\nto consider the whole matter and report to the committee such cases\r\nas were meritorious, or to adopt a general rule against the whole\r\npractice.  As chairman of that subcommittee, I appointed Mr. Root,\r\nand with him Mr. Lodge, Mr. Carter, Mr. Bacon, and Mr. Stone.  The\r\nsubcommittee, on March 10, 1910, submitted its report, which was\r\nadopted by the full committee and submitted to the Senate.  Besides\r\nreviewing at considerable length the reasons for legislation, the\r\nreport included the following salient features:\r\n\r\nFirst, the existence of the provision in the Constitution indicates\r\nthat the presumption is against the acceptance of the present,\r\nemolument, office, or title.  A habit of general and indiscriminate\r\nconsent by Congress upon such applications would tend practically\r\nto nullify the Constitutional provision, which is based upon an\r\napprehension, not without foundation, that our officers may be\r\naffected in the performance of their duties by the desire to receive\r\nsuch recognition from other Governments.  A strong support for the\r\nview that the practice should not be allowed to become general is\r\nto be found in the fact that the Government of the United States\r\ndoes not confer decorations or titles, or--unless in very exceptional\r\ncases--make presents to the officers of other Governments.  The\r\nreport then recommended that the following five rules be observed;\r\n\r\n\"1.  That no decoration should be received unless possibly when it\r\nis conferred for some exceptional, extraordinary, and highly\r\nmeritorious act, justifying beyond dispute a special mark of\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\n\"2.  That no presents should be received except such articles as\r\nare appropriate for souvenirs and marks of courtesy and appreciation,\r\nand having an intrinsic value not disproportionate to such a\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\"3.  That the acceptance of presents within the limitation above\r\nstated should be further limited to cases in which some exceptional\r\nservice or special relation justifying the mark of courtesy exists\r\nbetween the recipient and the Government offering the present.\r\n\r\n\"4.  That no offer of any other title or emolument or office should\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\n\"5.  We consider that membership in learned societies, even though\r\nthe appointment thereto may have a _quasi_ Governmental origin,\r\nshould not be considered as coming within the Constitutional\r\nprovision, and it may well be that as to certain trifling gifts,\r\nsuch as photographs, the rule of _de minimis lex non curat_ should\r\nbe deemed to apply.\"\r\n\r\nI agreed to the report of the subcommittee and agreed to the bill,\r\npermitting certain officers to accept the presents tendered to\r\nthem, where there were good reasons therefor; but I am free to say\r\nthat I was somewhat disappointed that the subcommittee had not\r\nreported in favor of abolishing the practice entirely, instead of\r\ndiscriminating between presents and decorations, as they did.\r\n\r\nThe bill passed the Senate without debate and without objection.\r\nIt went to the House, and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs,\r\nthrough Mr. Denby, of Michigan, submitted a most admirable report,\r\nwhich was far more in line with my own ideas than was the report\r\nof the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.  I agree with the\r\nconclusions arrived at by the Committee on Foreign Affairs so\r\nthoroughly that I am going to give most of that report here:\r\n\r\n\" . . . The subcommittee expresses the hope that this adverse\r\ndisposition of these bills, which contains items fairly representative\r\nof the great majority of the requests for Congressional sanction\r\nfor the acceptance of foreign orders, decorations, or presents, by\r\nofficials of the United States, will be regarded as notice to\r\nofficials of the United States that this committee at least, and\r\nit is hoped all future committees dealing with this subject-matter,\r\nwill refuse to consider such requests, except as hereinafter noted.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee of Foreign Affairs has been required to devote much\r\ntime to the consideration of bills to grant permission to accept\r\nsuch gifts.  The committee has in the past very generally declined\r\nto recommend favorably any such legislation, except in the case of\r\ndecorations offered to American citizens by official or quasi-\r\nofficial scientific associations for eminent scientific achievements.\"\r\n\r\nArticle 1, section 9, paragraph 8, of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates is quoted, and the report proceeds:\r\n\r\n\"The Congress has been frequently importuned since the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution to grant its consent for the acceptance of orders,\r\ndecorations, and presents offered to officials of our Government,\r\nfrequently upon pretexts the most trivial and for services the most\r\ncommonplace, when services of any kind were rendered at all.  A\r\nglance at the requests now on file, summarized in Calendar No. 378,\r\nwhich accompanies S. 7096, will show that the offers of foreign\r\ngifts, decorations, etc., have been made in the great majority of\r\ncases to officials for services in the direct line of their duty,\r\nand which in themselves, in the majority of cases, were not deserving\r\nof any special commendation.  Following a practice which, because\r\nof reciprocal considerations, probably operates satisfactorily\r\nbetween foreign powers, the Governments of the world frequently\r\ntender to our officers decorations or presents upon such occasions\r\nas the first visit of a fleet to a foreign power, or the presence\r\nof individual officers representing our Government at reviews and\r\npublic ceremonials, and to our diplomatic officials upon the\r\ntermination of their missions, or upon occasions of rejoicing,\r\njubilees of sovereigns, etc.  While the practice of exchanging such\r\ngraceful souvenirs is not unpleasing among the nations which\r\nrecognize and reciprocate the courtesy, it is entirely inappropriate\r\nthat officials of this Government should accept, or desire to\r\naccept, such presents.\r\n\r\n\"The prohibition of the Constitution appears to have been put there\r\nout of a well-founded desire to safeguard our officials from the\r\ninsidious influence of a natural but not desirable sense of obligation\r\ntoward the powers donor.  The history of nations abounds with\r\ninstances of the giving of rich presents to retiring ambassadors\r\nand ministers upon the conclusion of treaties or the satisfactory\r\ntermination of negotiations.  There can be no doubt of the danger\r\nof recognizing that the agent of our Government may properly be\r\ncompensated by another to which he is accredited.  Another and\r\nobvious objection to permitting our officials to receive gifts or\r\ndecorations from foreign powers is that, having no orders of nobility\r\nand no decorations in this country, and not recognizing the propriety\r\nof offering to officials of other powers, we can in no way reciprocate.\r\nIt is beneath the dignity of the American Government to receive,\r\nthrough its representatives, presents for which it can make no\r\nreturn.  The Constitutional prohibition is, in the opinion of the\r\nsubcommittee, a wise one, to which Congress should very seldom\r\npermit any exception.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore the subcommittee earnestly hopes that the Committee may\r\nput itself on record so unequivocally in this instance as to clearly\r\nindicate that it will not, except under circumstances the most\r\nunusual and extraordinary, grant permission to any official of the\r\nGovernment to receive such presents.\r\n\r\n\"To that end the subcommittee further recommends that this report\r\nmay, by resolution, be adopted as expressing the view of the members\r\nof the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives;\r\nthat this report may be printed, and that a copy may be communicated\r\nto the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n  \"(Signed) Edwin Denby,\r\n  \"H. W. Palmer,\r\n  \"H. D. Flood, Subcommittee,\r\n\r\n\"Adopted by the Committee of Foreign Affairs, April 7, 1910.\r\n  \"Frederic L. Davis, Clerk.\"\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that these two reports, first the report of the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and second, the report\r\nof the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House, taken together,\r\nwill effectually stop the application for permission to accept both\r\npresents and decorations from foreign Governments.  Indeed, I do\r\nnot think that the Secretary of State will again consent to apply\r\nto Congress in behalf of officers who have been tendered presents\r\nand decorations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\nISLE OF PINES, DANISH WEST INDIES, AND ALGECIRAS\r\n\r\nFor a number of years there was considerable controversy over the\r\nownership of the Isle of Pines, a small island separated from Cuba\r\nby about thirty miles of water, containing 1200 square miles.  This\r\ndot of land was not of the slightest account to the United States,\r\nso far as I could see; but after the treaty of peace with Spain,\r\na number of Americans purchased land there for the purpose of\r\nestablishing homes.  When the United States withdrew from Cuba and\r\nthe Cuban Republic was established, and the flag of Cuba was extended\r\nover the Island of Pines, those American residents protested and\r\ninsisted that the island belonged to the United States.  They had\r\nconsiderable ground for this contention, as Mr. Meikeljohn, when\r\nAssistant Secretary of War, had written a number of letters in\r\nwhich he stated that the Isle of Pines had been ceded to the United\r\nStates by Spain, and therefore was a part of our territory, although\r\nattached at the time to the division of Cuba for governmental\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace provided in article one that Spain relinquishes\r\nall claims of sovereignty over, and title to, Cuba; and in article\r\ntwo, that Spain cedes to the United States the Island of Porto\r\nRico, and other islands under Spanish sovereignty in the West\r\nIndies, and the Island of Guam in the Marianas or Ladrones.\r\n\r\nA strict construction of the treaty of peace with Spain would\r\nprobably give the island to the United States under article two.\r\n\r\nCuba, however, insisted that the island was a part of Cuban territory,\r\nbut it was provided in article six of the Platt amendments that\r\nthe title to the island should be left to future adjustment by\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nCuba granted to the United States two very valuable coaling stations,\r\nand the United States on its part agreed to enter into a treaty by\r\nwhich we should relinquish whatever title we might have to the\r\nIsland of Pines in favor of Cuba.\r\n\r\nA rather interesting incident occurred in connection with this\r\ntreaty which I believe I violate no confidence in now detailing,\r\nas both Presidents have retired from office.  President Roosevelt\r\nwas very anxious that the treaty be ratified; he was also most\r\nsolicitous that we should retain friendly relations with the Republic\r\nof Cuba, and felt that the island was not of the slightest importance\r\nto the United States from any standpoint, declaring that he would\r\nnot accept it.  I was at the White House one day when the treaty\r\nwas before the committee, and he showed me a letter written to him\r\nby President Palma, of Cuba, and my recollection is that he gave\r\nme a copy of it for such use as I might desire to make.  Mr. Palma\r\nurged in that letter that the Senate act favorably on the treaty,\r\nbecause if it did not his re-election as President of the Cuban\r\nRepublic would thereby be endangered.\r\n\r\nSo much opposition to the treaty developed in the Senate that I\r\ndeemed it useless to endeavor to bring it to a vote; and really,\r\nas I look at it now, there is very little use for the treaty at\r\nall, as Cuba is and has been exercising jurisdiction over the Isle\r\nof Pines.  Cuba must be giving the island a good government for\r\nthe American residents, as I have heard nothing from the island\r\nfor several years.\r\n\r\nIt was during the Fifty-seventh Congress that the treaty with\r\nDenmark, providing for the purchase by the United States of the\r\nDanish West Indies, consisting of the Islands of St. Thomas, St.\r\nJohn, and St. Croix, came before the committee.  I reported the\r\ntreaty to the Senate and urged, and finally secured, its\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nThe United States by this treaty agreed to pay five million dollars\r\nto Denmark for the islands.\r\n\r\nWe first attempted to purchase the islands in 1865, during the\r\nadministration of President Lincoln.  Secretary Seward was particularly\r\nanxious that the United States should acquire them, and a treaty\r\nwas negotiated and agreed to by Denmark.  The treaty was not acted\r\nupon during the administration of President Johnson, and because\r\nPresident Grant was particularly anxious for its ratification,\r\nCharles Sumner, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations (as\r\nin the case of the Santo Domingo treaty), opposed its ratification\r\nby the Senate, and it was defeated.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant showed a far-sighted policy in favoring the\r\nacquisition of every foot of territory which we could secure in\r\nthe West Indies.  The Danish islands are of great importance to\r\nthe United States in a strategic way, whether the strategy be\r\nmilitary or commercial.  St. Thomas is the natural point of call\r\nfor all European trade bound for the West Indies, Central America,\r\nor Northern South America.  These islands, together with Porto\r\nRico, occupy the north-eastern corner of the Caribbean Sea; and\r\nthey are of more importance now than ever, because of the fact that\r\nwe are constructing the Isthmian canal.  In view of that canal,\r\nand the European settlements in South America, every additional\r\nacquisition by the United States in the West Indies is invaluable.\r\nPorto Rico is difficult of defense.  The harbors are poor, while\r\nthe harbor in the Island of St. Thomas can be made one of the very\r\nbest in the West Indies.  Our own officers who investigated the\r\nsubject reported that the Island of St. Thomas possesses all the\r\nnatural advantages of a second Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe Danish Parliament, after a long debate, declined to ratify the\r\ntreaty of 1901 which had been ratified by the Senate, and for the\r\npresent at least the subject is in abeyance.\r\n\r\nI still hope, before I shall retire from the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations, that the United States may succeed in purchasing these\r\nvaluable islands.\r\n\r\nDuring the Winter of 1906 there occurred in the Senate a very\r\ninteresting debate over the appointment of representatives of the\r\nUnited States to participate in the so-called Algeciras Conference,\r\nheld in Algeciras in 1905 to consider conditions in Morocco.  No\r\naction was taken by the Senate, and in due course the act or treaty\r\nagreed to at that conference was submitted to the Senate for\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nI do not think there can be the slightest doubt that President\r\nRoosevelt had full authority to appoint the delegates on the part\r\nof the United States, and that he was thoroughly justified in\r\ncontending that it was not only the right but the duty of the United\r\nStates to participate in this conference.  The action of the\r\nPresident in accepting the invitation to the conference and appointing\r\nthe delegates, and the very important part therein which he took\r\npersonally, in addition to the interest manifested through his\r\nrepresentatives, very properly received the commendation of the\r\npeople of this country and of the whole European world.\r\n\r\nThe Moroccan Empire was one of the earliest and most interesting\r\nof the world's Governments.  During the latter part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury Morocco occupied the attention of the maritime nations of\r\nthe civilized world, as it was the home of the Barbary pirates who\r\npreyed upon the commerce of all the nations.  The United States\r\nitself paid tribute for the purchase of immunity from these pirates.\r\nOne of our earliest treaties, made before the adoption of the\r\nConstitution in 1787, was a treaty of peace and friendship with\r\nMorocco.  We entered into several treaties with Morocco later, and\r\njoined in treaties concerning that country in 1865 and 1880 with\r\nAustria, Belgium, Spain, France, Great Britain, Italy, Portugal,\r\nand other Nations.\r\n\r\nFor many years Great Britain and France have claimed to have superior\r\nrights in Morocco, and it has seemed to be the desire of France to\r\nannex it.  Germany has intervened, and the country has been a bone\r\nof contention among the European Nations.  In 1904 Great Britain\r\nand France, by a secret treaty, agreed that France should have the\r\ndominating control in Morocco, and that Great Britain should dominate\r\nin Egypt.  Germany opposed the French Protectorate and insisted\r\nthat an international conference of the powers should be called.\r\nAt one time it seemed that war was inevitable, and it probably was\r\naverted only by the Algeciras Conference.  The United States was\r\nasked to participate, as we had participated in the conference of\r\n1880.  If we had not accepted the invitation there would have been\r\nno conference, as two of the great powers had served notice that\r\nall nations represented at the 1880 conference must participate in\r\nthe Algeciras Conference, or they would withdraw.  Our participation\r\nwas in the interest of averting a European war.\r\n\r\nThe General Act or Treaty agreed to at that conference was a lengthy\r\nand important one.  Its details are not of much importance, as our\r\ndelegates signed it under a significant reservation that we would\r\nnot assume any obligation or responsibility for the enforcement of\r\nthe Act.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the Senate, there was quite a combat over its\r\nratification.  We could not secure its endorsement during the\r\nsession which closed the first of July, 1906, but we were able to\r\nreach an agreement that it should be voted on in committee and in\r\nthe Senate during the month of December following.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt was very much concerned about its ratification,\r\nand on June 26, 1906, when it seemed pretty certain that the Senate\r\nwould adjourn without acting on the general Act, he wrote me this\r\nquite characteristic letter:\r\n\r\n  \"White House, Washington, _June 26, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Senator Cullom:\r\n\r\n\"Having reference to the letter which Secretary Root wrote you\r\nyesterday about the Algeciras Convention, I can only add that I\r\nearnestly hope this matter will receive favorable report from the\r\ncommittee at this session.  I am literally unable to understand\r\nhow any human being can find anything whatever to object to in this\r\ntreaty; and to reject it would mean that for the first time since\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution this Government will be without\r\na treaty with Morocco.  It seems incredible that there should be\r\na serious purpose to put us in such a position.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely yours,\r\n  \"(Signed) Theodore Roosevelt.\"\r\n\r\nThe General Act would probably not have been ratified by the Senate\r\nhad we not agreed on the form of the resolution of ratification.\r\nThat resolution provided:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved further, that the Senate, as a part of this act of\r\nratification, understands that the participation of the United\r\nStates in the Algeciras Conference and in the formation and adoption\r\nof the general Act and Protocol which resulted therefrom, was with\r\nthe sole purpose of preserving and increasing its commerce in\r\nMorocco, the protection as to life, liberty, and property of its\r\ncitizens residing and travelling therein, and of aiding by its\r\nfriendly offices and efforts in removing friction and controversy\r\nwhich seemed to menace the peace between powers signatory with the\r\nUnited States to the treaty of 1880, all of which are on terms of\r\namity with this Government, and without purpose to depart from the\r\ntraditional American foreign policy which forbids participation by\r\nthe United States in the settlement of political questions which\r\nare entirely European in their scope.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this form of resolution had been agreed to by those favoring\r\nand those opposing the treaty, I showed it to President Roosevelt.\r\nHe expressed his satisfaction with it, and the Act was ratified by\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to cover only a very few of the more important\r\nmatters which have come before the Committee on Foreign Relations\r\nsince I have been its chairman.  The treaties before the committee\r\nhave embraced almost every subject of contact between two independent\r\nNations.  Numerous treaties involving extradition, boundaries,\r\nnaturalization, claims, sanitation, trade-marks, consular and\r\ndiplomatic friendship, and commerce, and many other subjects, have\r\nbeen before the committee and have been acted upon and ratified by\r\nthe Senate.  During the period of which I am now writing, I believe\r\nthat we have ratified treaties with almost every independent Nation\r\nof the world.  The many important matters now pending, or of more\r\nrecent date, I am not at liberty to refer to, the injunction of\r\nsecrecy not yet having been removed.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Relations Committee will continue in the future, as it\r\nhas in the past, one of the Senate's foremost committees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\nCONGRESS UNDER THE TAFT ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nIt had been my intention to close these recollections with the\r\nbeginning of the Taft Administration, but their publication has\r\nbeen deferred until the Administration extended so far that it\r\nseems proper to bring my observations up to date.  I am especially\r\nimpelled to this course by the fact that the present era has\r\ndeveloped a very marked change in the character of the Senate, and,\r\nto a limited extent at least, in the trend of political thought in\r\nthe country at large--a change which should be noted in any permanent\r\nwriting dealing with the period.  Still, I have no intention of\r\nentering upon a detailed consideration of men or of conditions.\r\nMy only purpose is to make brief mention of these conditions and\r\nto refer in very general terms to some who have given direction to\r\nrecent public affairs.\r\n\r\nObservers of public events and students of political questions\r\nprobably were given their first insight into the tendency of the\r\ntimes through the resignation from the Senate of Honorable John C.\r\nSpooner, of Wisconsin, which was tendered March 30, 1907.  I have\r\nmade frequent reference to Mr. Spooner's connection with the Senate,\r\nand I do not intend to say more of him here than that he stood for\r\nconservatism and the old traditions.  Sensitive to a degree to the\r\npromptings of his conscience, and still desirous of representing\r\nthe sentiment of his constituents, apparently he found himself\r\nembarrassed by the growth in his State of what, without intending\r\nany disrespect, I may designate as \"La Follette-ism.\"\r\n\r\nGradually Hon. Robert M. La Follette, who previously had served\r\nseveral terms in the House of Representatives, had been forging\r\nhis way to the front in Wisconsin politics until in 1905 he was\r\nelected to serve as Mr. Spooner's colleague in the Senate.  He\r\nstood for radicalism in the Republican party as against Mr. Spooner's\r\nconservatism; he was the advocate of many innovations and experiments,\r\nwhile Mr. Spooner held to the old and tried forms of procedure in\r\npublic affairs.  Whether Mr. La Follette was the leader of this\r\nnew propaganda or the follower of a growing sentiment in the State\r\ndoes not matter to this record.  It is sufficient to know that\r\napparently Wisconsin public opinion did not support Mr. Spooner to\r\na sufficient extent to justify a man of his conscientious disposition\r\nin retaining his place as the representative of the people of that\r\nState in the highest legislative body of the Nation.  Moreover,\r\nsplendid lawyer that he was, he knew that he could find much more\r\nlucrative employment outside the halls of legislation, and he felt\r\nthe need of making adequate provision for his family.  In consequence\r\nof these conditions, he left the Senate, and thus opened the way\r\nfor the more rapid promotion in that body of the new school of\r\npolitics for which his colleague stood, a school which, while it\r\nhas found some exponents in the House of Representatives, is not\r\ncomparatively so largely represented there as in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe La Follette group is designated by its own disciples as\r\n\"Progressivism,\" whereas by outsiders it is generally referred to\r\nas \"Insurgency.\"  Mr. La Follette came to the Senate with the Fifty-\r\nninth Congress, and no sooner had he entered that body then he\r\nbegan to propound his doctrines there.  At first, he stood alone,\r\nbut natural inclination soon drew to him such of the older Senators\r\nas the late Jonathan P. Dolliver, of Iowa, and Moses E. Clapp, of\r\nMinnesota, both of them men of splendid attainments and of high\r\nmoral character.  With the incoming of Mr. Taft as President came\r\nalso Albert B. Cummins, of Iowa, Joseph L. Bristow, of Kansas, and\r\nCoe I. Crawford, of South Dakota, all of whom joined heartily with\r\nMr. La Follette in his efforts to shape legislation.\r\n\r\nDuring the Sixty-first Congress, the tariff law was revised.  The\r\nDingley Act of 1897 had grown unpopular in some portions of the\r\ncountry, because it was believed that under it the duties were not\r\nequitably distributed, and the campaign of 1908 had been fought\r\nupon a platform declaring for a revision.  When, therefore, Congress\r\nmet in March, 1909, being called together in extraordinary session\r\nby President Taft, every one recognized the necessity for entering\r\nupon this work.  There had been no specific declaration in the\r\nplatform as to the character of the revision.  Some, commonly called\r\n\"stand-patters,\" contended for a readjustment without any general\r\nlowering of rates, while others held out stiffly for a reduction\r\nall along the line.  The result of the work of Congress was the\r\nenactment of what is known as the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Law of 1909,\r\nthe measure taking its name on account of the joint efforts in its\r\nbehalf of the Honorable Sereno Payne, of New York, Chairman of the\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means of the House, and Honorable Nelson W.\r\nAldrich, of Rhode Island, Chairman of the Committee on Finance of\r\nthe Senate.  The Payne-Aldrich law is a Protective measure, as it\r\nwas intended to be.  The Progressives, in both the Senate and House,\r\nsought at every step to reduce the schedules, but generally without\r\nsuccess.  In this effort, they were supported by Democratic Senators\r\nand Representatives, but the \"Old Guard\" controlled such a pronounced\r\nmajority in both Houses as to render the opposing efforts futile,\r\nfierce though they were.  So general was this conflict that in many\r\nmatters the Progressives soon established a faction of their own.\r\nThere were many skirmishes all along the line.  Their divergence\r\nfrom the views of Regular Republicanism was indicated not on the\r\ntariff alone, but on many other questions of public policy which\r\nI may say I regard as extremely visionary and impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe controversy also covered the methods of procedure of both the\r\nSenate and the House, and the fight on \"Uncle\" Joe Cannon as Speaker,\r\nor on \"Cannonism,\" which characterized the last session of the\r\nSixty-first Congress, was one of the instances of this difference\r\nof opinion in the party.  In a less pronounced manner the Progressives\r\nalso have shown an inclination to antagonize and overturn the\r\ncustoms of the Senate.  They feel the restraint of some of the\r\nSenate's established rules, and, together with the radical element\r\nwhich has been introduced on the Democratic side of the Senate\r\nChamber, they manifest evident impatience with these regulations.\r\nThat fine old term \"senatorial courtesy\" has lost much of its\r\nmeaning as a result of the brusque and breezy manner of the time.\r\nNo longer is it said that the young Senator must be seen rather\r\nthan heard.  Indeed, while formerly the spectacle of a Senator\r\nrising to make a speech before the close of his second year in the\r\nSenate was regarded as unusual, it recently has come to be remarked\r\nupon if a new man remains in his seat for two months before\r\nundertaking to enlighten the Senate as to its duties towards itself\r\nand the world.\r\n\r\nI am not undertaking here to pronounce against these innovations,\r\nbut merely to record facts.  I have shown my advocacy of proper\r\nrailroad legislation and of other progressive legislation which\r\ncommended itself to my judgment.  However, I am classed as a Regular\r\nand desire to be.  My votes have been with the party organization.\r\nI have made it a rule throughout my political career to stand for\r\nthe general principles of the party as enunciated by its authorized\r\nbodies; but while that is my course, I do not pretend to say that\r\nthat organization always represents all that is good and best for\r\nthe country or that in many cases the Progressives and Insurgents\r\nmay not be nearer right than the Regulars.  In the main, however,\r\nI have found that the best results are obtained through following\r\nthe course indicated by the united wisdom of the party.  My plan\r\nhas been to exert my influence in the direction of careful and\r\nconservative progression within established party lines, and in\r\nsuch a course do I believe that the Republican party can best insure\r\nits perpetuity.\r\n\r\nSenator Spooner's resignation from the Senate was followed by the\r\nrefusal of Senators Hale and Aldrich to stand for re-election in\r\n1911.  The retirement of those three distinguished leaders constitutes\r\nthe best index of the tendency of the times.  Men of experience,\r\ndignity, and conservatism, they voluntarily gave way before the\r\npress of public exigency.  True, they consulted their own inclinations,\r\nbut I always have thought that if the old conditions had continued\r\nin the Senate they would have elected to remain there.  Their seats\r\nare filled by good and true men, but by men of very different\r\ncharacteristics, unless an exception may be made in Senator Aldrich's\r\ncase, whose successor, Henry F. Lippitt, appears to be a man much\r\nlike his predecessor.  Whether the change will be beneficial or\r\notherwise remains to be seen, but my optimism is so great I do not\r\nbelieve that anything but good can come permanently to this great\r\ncountry of ours.  I confess to a liking for the old methods.\r\n\r\nThis general change of public sentiment has brought into the Senate\r\nnot only Mr. La Follette, Mr. Bristow, Mr. Clapp, Mr. Cummins, and\r\nMr. Crawford, but also a number of other men of similar views, so\r\nthat within six or seven years the progressive group has increased\r\nto thirteen members, more than one-fourth of the membership of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nI shall not undertake to mention all of those contained in this\r\nlittle body, but I have been so impressed with the bearing of\r\nSenator William E. Borah, of Idaho, and Senator Joseph M. Dixon,\r\nof Montana, that I do not feel justified in passing them by unnoticed.\r\nThey are both very able men and men of high purpose.  They do not\r\nstand with this group all the time; neither goes where his convictions\r\ndo not lead.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these Republicans of supposedly advanced thought have\r\nfound their counterpart in a number of new Senators who have taken\r\ntheir seats on the Democratic side.  The Democrats, as well as the\r\nRepublicans, have their Progressive, or Radical, element, and while\r\nthe Democratic representatives of this thought differ from those\r\non the Republican side on the subject of Protection, they have co-\r\noperated in the interest of what they consider a closer approach\r\nto the demands of the people on other subjects of legislation.  On\r\nthe tariff schedules, which have been presented during the special\r\nsession of the Sixty-second Congress now coming to a close, they\r\nalso have stood together, forming what some have been pleased to\r\nchristen the \"Unholy Alliance.\"  Both Republicans and Democrats of\r\nthe radical type are contending for a lower tariff, but this one\r\nimportant difference is noticeable:  while there is a tendency on\r\nthe Democratic side toward free trade, the Republican members of\r\nthe alliance hold out for the protective principle.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to me to be able to record that while a sufficient\r\nnumber of new men have come into the Senate to cause a modification\r\nof its general appearance and apparent purposes, there still are\r\nenough representatives of the old element to cause it to retain\r\nits distinctive character as the most conservative deliberative\r\nbody in this country.  In addition to the new men, such capable\r\nlegislators remain as Lodge and Crane, of Massachusetts, Brandegee,\r\nof Connecticut, Burton, of Ohio, Jones, of Washington, Root, of\r\nNew York, Gallinger and Burnham, of New Hampshire, Heyburn, of\r\nIdaho, Penrose and Oliver, of Pennsylvania, Perkins, of California,\r\nSmoot and Sutherland, of Utah, Clark and Warren, of Wyoming,\r\nDillingham and Page, of Vermont, Wetmore, of Rhode Island, Curtis,\r\nof Kansas, McCumber, of North Dakota, Gamble, of South Dakota,\r\nWilliam Alden Smith and Charles E. Townsend, of Michigan, Bradley,\r\nof Kentucky, and others, all Republicans, while among the old-time\r\nDemocrats should be mentioned such stanch and true men as Martin,\r\nof Virginia, Bacon, of Georgia, Bailey and Culberson, of Texas,\r\nTaylor, of Tennessee, Shively, of Indiana, Tillman, of South\r\nCarolina, Fletcher, of Florida, Foster, of Louisiana, Johnston and\r\nBankhead, of Alabama, Stone, of Missouri, Clarke, of Arkansas,\r\nNewlands, of Nevada, and still others who, though their names may\r\nnot be mentioned, all command the high regard of their colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked, \"Who has succeeded Aldrich as leader\r\nof the Senate?\"  No one.  Practically, there are three parties in\r\nthe Senate, consisting of thirty-seven Regular Republicans, forty-\r\none Democrats, and thirteen Insurgent Republicans.  In caucus, the\r\nInsurgents act with the Regulars, but in legislation, they more\r\nfrequently line up with the Democrats.  The consequence is that no\r\nparty is in control, and therefore that no party can dictate the\r\ncourse of leadership.  Under such circumstances, real leadership\r\nis out of the question.  Senator Penrose succeeds Senator Aldrich\r\nas Chairman of the Committee on Finance, and is proving thoroughly\r\ncompetent for his work in that capacity.  If emergency should arise\r\nthrowing the direction of affairs into the hands of the Republican\r\nparty, he might also succeed the Rhode Island Senator to the\r\nleadership of the Republican forces, but until such emergency\r\npresents itself, no one can see whether that position would fall\r\nto him or to some other Republican.  Leaders are born, not made.\r\nLeadership is not a matter of selection, but of fitness.\r\n\r\nUp to the present writing (August, 1911), President Taft has been\r\nin office almost two and a half years, and while, like all Presidents,\r\nhe has been criticised, I am confident that in the end the first\r\nhalf of his administration will receive the approval of the historian.\r\nPersonally, no more popular man ever occupied the office of Chief\r\nExecutive, and his popularity is due to his honesty of purpose and\r\nhis love for his fellow man.  His administration has witnessed such\r\na prosecution of the unlawful trusts as never before has been known,\r\nand the President himself has been engaged in a constant endeavor\r\nfor legislation which would equalize the benefits of American\r\ncitizenship, relieve the distresses of the less fortunate, and put\r\na stop to graft, wherever found.  Under his direction, the Interstate\r\nCommerce Law has been vastly improved, postal savings banks have\r\nbeen established, and the conservation of our natural resources\r\nhas been placed upon a safe and sane basis.  He has pressed\r\nReciprocity and Arbitration with other Nations, and he has established\r\nsuch an era of good fellowship among public men of all parties and\r\nbeliefs as seldom has been known in our history.  If the remainder\r\nof his administration proves as successful as that which has passed,\r\nhe will deserve, as I believe he will receive, the endorsement of\r\nthe people through an election to a second term.\r\n\r\nThe present presiding officer of the Senate is  Hon. James Schoolcraft\r\nSherman, who was elected Vice-President on the national ticket of\r\n1908 with President Taft.  Mr. Sherman brings to this office an\r\nexperience of twenty years as a member of the House of Representatives\r\nfrom the Utica district, much of which time he was a member of the\r\nCommittee on Rules.  He is an accomplished parliamentarian, a fact\r\nwhich taken in connection with his genial disposition, his kindness\r\nof heart, and, above all, his love of justice, renders him one of\r\nthe most acceptable presiding officers that the Senate ever has\r\nhad.  He has held his office during all of the regular session of\r\nthe Sixty-first Congress and has been constantly in his seat during\r\nthe special session of the Sixty-second Congress, and it is safe\r\nto say that in so brief a time no man has more thoroughly endeared\r\nhimself to members of the Senate of whatever party or faction.\r\nOccasionally, of course, as is the case with all presiding officers,\r\nhis decisions are challenged; but I believe he has been uniformly\r\nsustained; and even such proceedings are stripped of all appearance\r\nof rancor through his kindness of manner and his evident conviction.\r\nHe is a fit successor of Hobart and Fairbanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\nLINCOLN CENTENNIAL: LINCOLN LIBRARY\r\n\r\nThe name of Springfield will forever be immortalized as the home\r\nand burial-place of Abraham Lincoln.  As the hundredth anniversary\r\nof his birth approached, it was determined to hold a great celebration,\r\nand it was generally agreed that Springfield was the fitting and\r\nproper place in which to hold it.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the Legislature of Illinois passed a joint resolution\r\nproviding:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Abraham\r\nLincoln will occur on the twelfth day of February, 1909; and,\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, it is fitting and proper that the State of Illinois should\r\ncelebrate the anniversary of the birth of this greatest of all\r\nAmerican statesmen; therefore, be it\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, by the Senate of the State of Illinois, the House of\r\nRepresentatives concurring therein, that the one hundredth anniversary\r\nof the birth of Abraham Lincoln be celebrated in the City of\r\nSpringfield, on the twelfth day of February, 1909, and, be it\r\nfurther\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, that the Governor is hereby authorized and empowered to\r\nappoint a commission of fifteen representative citizens of this\r\nState to have charge of all arrangements for such celebration.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor thereupon appointed fifteen of the most distinguished\r\ncitizens of Springfield as the State Centennial Commission to have\r\ncharge of the celebration.\r\n\r\nIt was determined that the celebration should not be a local one,\r\nbut should be more in the nature of a State celebration, and that\r\nit would be well to incorporate it under the name of \"The Lincoln\r\nCentennial Association.\"  The original incorporators were:\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States;\r\nthe Hon. Shelby M. Cullom, United States Senator; the Hon. Albert\r\nJ. Hopkins, United States Senator; the Hon. Joseph G. Cannon,\r\nSpeaker of the National House of Representatives; the Hon. Adlai\r\nE. Stevenson; the Hon. Charles S. Deneen, Governor of Illinois;\r\nthe Hon. John P. Hand, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the\r\nState of Illinois; the Hon. J. Otis Humphrey, Judge of the United\r\nStates District Court; the Hon. James A. Rose, Secretary of State\r\nof Illinois; the Hon. Ben. F. Caldwell, Member of Congress; the\r\nHon. Richard Yates; Melville E. Stone, Esq.; Horace White, Esq.;\r\nJohn W. Bunn, Esq.; and Dr. William Jayne.\r\n\r\nI was requested to secure speakers of national reputation, and it\r\nat once occurred to me that I would invite the Ambassadors of France\r\nand Great Britain, and Senator J. P. Dolliver, to visit Springfield,\r\non February 12, 1909, and deliver addresses.  These distinguished\r\ngentlemen at once accepted the invitation which I extended them on\r\nbehalf of the Governor and the committee.  Later, the Hon. William\r\nJennings Bryan was invited to be present also and deliver an address,\r\nwhich invitation he accepted.\r\n\r\nThe memorial exercises celebrating the hundredth anniversary of\r\nLincoln's birth were held under the direction of the State Centennial\r\nCommission, appointed by the Governor, working in conjunction with\r\nthe Lincoln Centennial Association.  There were a number of distinct\r\nevents, but the most important were the great memorial exercises\r\nheld in the State Armory, at which addresses were made by Ambassadors\r\nJusserand and Bryce, and by Senator Dolliver and Mr. Bryan, and a\r\nbanquet served to eight hundred guests.  The celebration was in\r\nevery way a great success, largely due to the efforts of Judge\r\nHumphrey.\r\n\r\nIt was quite an event in the history of Springfield, as it was the\r\nfirst time, so far as I know, that the Ambassadors of two great\r\nNations visited Springfield.\r\n\r\nI regretted very much that I was so engaged in matters pertaining\r\nto my official duties in Washington that it seemed impossible for\r\nme to be present.  I was requested to write something which could\r\nbe read at the banquet, and so I addressed to Judge Humphrey the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C.,\r\n  \"_February 6, 1909_.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. J. Otis Humphrey,\r\n  \"President Lincoln Centennial Association,\r\n  \"Springfield, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Judge:\r\n\r\n\"It is a matter of sincere regret to me that I am unable to be\r\npresent at your great anniversary celebration of the birth of the\r\nimmortal Lincoln, and to welcome to my home city the Ambassadors\r\nof Great Britain and France and the distinguished guests who are\r\nto be with you.\r\n\r\n\"Abraham Lincoln, greatest of Americans, greatest of men, emancipator,\r\nmartyr, his service to his country has not been equalled by any\r\nAmerican citizen, not even by Washington.  His name and life have\r\nbeen an inspiration to me from my earliest recollection.\r\n\r\n\"On this one hundredth anniversary of his birth, the people, without\r\nregard to creed, color, condition, or section, in all parts of this\r\nUnion which he saved, are striving to do honor to his memory.  No\r\nAmerican has ever before received such deserved universal praise.\r\nNot only in his own country, but throughout the civilized world,\r\nAbraham Lincoln is regarded as one of the few, the very few, truly\r\ngreat men in history.  His memory is as fresh to-day in the minds\r\nand hearts of the people as it was forty years ago, and the passing\r\nyears only add to his fame and serve to give us a truer conception\r\nof his noble character.  The events of his life, his words of\r\nwisdom, have been gathered together in countless volumes to be\r\ntreasured up and handed down to generations yet to come.\r\n\r\n\"I knew him intimately in Springfield; I heard him utter his simple\r\nfarewell to his friends and neighbors when he departed to assume\r\na task greater than any President had been called upon to assume\r\nin our history; it was my sad duty to accompany his mortal remains\r\nfrom the capital of the Nation to the capital of Illinois; and as\r\nI gazed upon his face the last time, I thanked God it had been my\r\nprivilege to know him as a friend; and I felt then, as I more fully\r\nrealize now, that the good he had done would live through all the\r\nages to bless the world.\r\n\r\n\"Springfield, his only real home, the scene of his great political\r\ntriumph, was his fitting resting-place.  In the midst of this great\r\ncontinent his dust shall rest a sacred treasure to myriads who\r\nshall pilgrim to his shrine to kindle anew their zeal and\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\n\"Again expressing regret that I can not be with you to take part\r\nin honoring the memory of our greatest President, on the one\r\nhundredth anniversary of his birth, and feeling sure that the\r\nSpringfield celebration will be the most notable of all, as it\r\nshould be, I remain\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely yours,\r\n  \"(Signed) S. M. Cullom.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the notable celebrations held on the one hundredth anniversary\r\nof the birth of Lincoln in every part of the United States, the\r\nSpringfield observance was the most dignified and impressive; and\r\nit was determined that on Lincoln's birthday each year, under the\r\nauspices of the Lincoln Centennial Association, fitting memorial\r\nexercises should take place in Springfield, to which guests and\r\nspeakers of national and international renown, from all parts of\r\nthe United States, should be invited.\r\n\r\nSpringfield has a great public library, called the \"Lincoln Library,\"\r\ntoward which Andrew Carnegie very generously contributed seventy-\r\nfive thousand dollars.  I took considerable interest in the\r\nSpringfield Library, and I did what I could to prevail upon Mr.\r\nCarnegie to make as generous a contribution as he would toward the\r\nproject.  I remember that I wrote him a letter on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt was at first proposed by the Springfield people to name the\r\nLibrary \"The Lincoln-Carnegie Memorial Library\"; but after Mr.\r\nCarnegie had made his contribution, through his secretary he informed\r\nthe Rev. E. S. Walker, of Springfield, who carried on the correspondence\r\nwith him, that he would consider it a desecration to have any name\r\nlisted with that of Lincoln.  \"He trusts that the library will be\r\nknown as the 'Lincoln Library,' not the 'Lincoln Memorial Library,'\r\nas Lincoln needs no memorial, being one of the dozen supremely\r\ngreat rulers of men the world has ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Library was completed in 1904, and I was invited to deliver\r\nthe dedicatory address, which invitation I was very glad to accept.\r\nIt was an interesting occasion, held in the main room of the library\r\nbuilding, which was crowded with the very best people of the city.\r\nI give a few extracts from the speech I delivered that evening:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman:  It was a great pleasure to me to be invited by your\r\nlibrary board to participate in these exercises attending the\r\nopening of this splendid library building.\r\n\r\n\"I can not resist on this occasion the inclination to say a few\r\nwords in reference to Springfield and my early relations to it.\r\n\r\n\"Old historic Springfield!  Here have taken place many of the most\r\nimportant events in the history of Illinois.  Springfield has been\r\nthe centre of the political struggles of both parties since it has\r\nbeen the capital of the State.  Many of the great statesmen of\r\nIllinois have occupied seats in the legislative hall in Springfield.\r\nHere were mobilized during the Civil War the thousands of troops\r\nwho went forth to do and die for the Union.  Here the greatest\r\nGeneral of the age received his first command.  Here Lincoln and\r\nDouglas met, and from here Lincoln went forth to assume a task\r\ngreater than any President has been called upon to undertake in\r\nall our history.\r\n\r\n\"Springfield is endeared to me by all the sacred memories of\r\nfriendship, family, and home.\r\n\r\n\"I came here fifty years ago.  In Springfield I received my legal\r\neducation, was admitted to the Bar, and in your old courthouse here\r\nI practised my profession.  In Springfield I married and reared my\r\nfamily, and here my children are laid in their final resting-place.\r\n\r\n\"Those early days of my residence here are among the happiest of\r\nmy life.  Official duties have necessitated my absence a great part\r\nof the time for the past twenty years, but my heart lingers with\r\nit, and the ties which made those early days so happy will never\r\nbe broken so long as I shall live.\"\r\n\r\nAfter giving a history of the library and referring to the generosity\r\nof Mr. Carnegie, I continued:\r\n\r\n\"This is a material age.  Carnegie, the great captain of industry,\r\nis a typical representative of the leaders of this age.  It is well\r\nworth our while to stop to consider why he should devote a part of\r\nhis great wealth to the founding of public libraries.\r\n\r\n\"Andrew Carnegie was a poor boy, enjoying none of the advantages\r\nand opportunities which are afforded by a good library.  He missed\r\nin his early life the opportunity for culture which is now obtained\r\nthrough the facilities supplied by libraries in the towns and\r\ncities.  He knew that there was no other agency so valuable for\r\nthe purpose of spreading culture among the people as the public\r\nlibrary.  No word so precisely describes the influence of good\r\nreading as does the word 'culture'.  Emerson tells us that the word\r\nof ambition of the present day is 'culture.'\r\n\r\n\"Andrew Carnegie, the great leader of the industrial world, desiring\r\nto give to the young men and the young women of this day an\r\nopportunity for education, for culture, whose value to the young\r\nhe realizes so well, has devoted the enormous fortune of over one\r\nhundred million dollars for the founding of public libraries. . . .\r\n\r\n\"There should be no pleasure like the pleasure derived from reading\r\na good book.  Emerson, expressing our debt to a book says:  'Let\r\nus not forget the genial, miraculous, we have known to proceed from\r\na book.  We go musing into the vaults of day and night; no\r\nconstellation shines, no muse descends, the stars are white points,\r\nthe roses brick-colored leaves; and frogs pipe, mice cheep, and\r\nwagons creak along the road.  We return to the house and take up\r\nPlutarch or Augustine, and read a few sentences or pages, and lo,\r\nthe air swims with life, secrets of magnanimity and grandeur invite\r\nus on every hand, life is made of them.  Such is our debt to a\r\nbook.'\r\n\r\n\"The founding of public libraries is the surest mark of advanced\r\ncivilization.  The origin of libraries is lost in the dim twilight\r\nof the early ages.  When they commenced, how they commenced, we do\r\nnot know; but we have authentic records that centuries before the\r\nChristian era the temples of those countries of the East where\r\ncivilization had made the greatest advances, contained libraries\r\nof clay tablets, carefully shelved in regular order.  Among the\r\nGreeks, private libraries existed at least four hundred years before\r\nthe birth of Christ.  The Roman Caesars returning from conquest to\r\nthe development of the arts of peace, established libraries in the\r\nthen great Capital of the World.\r\n\r\n\"But the United States is pre-eminently the home of the free public\r\nlibraries, supported by taxation.  This country has more free public\r\nlibraries than any other country in the world.\r\n\r\n\"What a great thing it is for our people to have these advantages!\r\nThe foundations of our Republic are being well laid.  The family,\r\nthe church, the school--and the library!  A people who will adhere\r\nto the great principles of the sacredness of the family, the church,\r\nand the school, will not perish from the earth.  Virtue and\r\nintelligence are the necessary foundations on which a republic must\r\nrest.  Education is more necessary in a republic, where the people\r\nare the sovereigns, than it is in a monarchy, where the people are\r\nsubjects.  With education and the library comes culture.  The\r\nfamily, the church, the school, and the library are all necessary\r\nto qualify the citizen for the great duties of life. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Carnegie has given us this building and has requested that it\r\nbe named in honor of the great emancipator, Abraham Lincoln.  Like\r\na number of others who are in this room to-night, I knew Abraham\r\nLincoln intimately and well.  We are proud that this city was the\r\nhome of Abraham Lincoln while living, and now that he has passed\r\naway, it is the home of his sacred dust.  The words of Mr. Carnegie,\r\nthat no name should be coupled with the name of Mr. Lincoln manifested\r\nthe highest appreciation by him of the great name of Lincoln.  He\r\nwas a noble man.  Only forty-three years ago, he was going in and\r\nout among us, interested in the local affairs of our city, doing\r\nhis duty in the common affairs of our community, and at the same\r\ntime grappling with the great questions pressing upon the attention\r\nof the people and touching the life of the Nation.\r\n\r\n\"My friends, in the language of Mr. Carnegie, Lincoln has been 'one\r\nof a dozen supremely great rulers of men that the world has seen.'\r\nHe was one of a few men in the world's history whose great and\r\nnoble life and deeds will be remembered forever.  I rejoice that\r\nhe lived among us and that he was loved by our people while he\r\nlived, and that his memory is fresh and green in our hearts.\r\n\r\n\"My friends, as we reflect upon the progress of our Nation in wealth\r\nand power and influence among the Nations of the world in the\r\ncentury just closed, our hearts swell with pride and thankfulness\r\nthat we have been so favored.  As a Nation we are now in the first\r\nrank of the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Let us do our part in maintaining our national supremacy.  We can\r\nhold our place by standing by the right as a community, as a State,\r\nand as a Nation, adhering rigidly to the foundation principles of\r\nour Republican Government, cherishing liberty, and obeying law;\r\nupholding the sacredness of the family, the church, and the school;\r\nwith school, the library will follow, and in the time to come our\r\nNation will endure, and its people will cultivate from generation\r\nto generation, a better and higher civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\nCONSECUTIVE ELECTIONS TO UNITED STATES SENATE\r\n\r\nI was twice elected Governor of Illinois, and have been elected to\r\nthe United States Senate for five consecutive terms, and as I write\r\nthis narrative I have served in the Senate more than twenty-eight\r\nyears.  I consider this a greater honor than an election to the\r\nPresidency of the United States.  I owe the deepest debt of gratitude\r\nto the people of the State of Illinois, who have for so many years\r\ncontinued me in the public service.  To my many friends who have\r\nso loyally supported me during all these years, I am profoundly\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to my first election to the United States\r\nSenate.  At the conclusion of my first term, I was, on January 22,\r\n1889, re-elected without opposition.\r\n\r\nThe country had turned the Republican party out of power and elected\r\nMr. Cleveland in 1892; and for the first time since 1856, the State\r\nof Illinois went Democratic and elected Mr. Altgeld as Governor.\r\nI returned to Illinois, from Washington, to enter the campaign in\r\n1894, having little or no hope that I could be re-elected to the\r\nSenate, as I supposed, of course, that the State would continue in\r\nthe control of the Democratic party.  Having been twice elected to\r\nthe United States Senate, I deemed it my duty to make the best\r\nfight I could for Republican success, regardless of my own personal\r\ninterest in the matter.  The Democrats were confident they would\r\ncarry the Legislature, and Mr. Franklin MacVeagh, who is now\r\nSecretary of the Treasury under a Republican President, was the\r\ncandidate of the Democratic party for the Senate to succeed me.\r\nMr. MacVeagh made a canvass of the State as a candidate for United\r\nStates Senator against me.  Very much to his surprise, the State\r\nwent overwhelmingly Republican and elected a Republican Legislature,\r\ninsuring the election of a Republican to the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhile I had made the canvass of the State, it was not until after\r\nthe election, when it became known that we had elected a Republican\r\nLegislature, that opposition to my re-election developed in the\r\nRepublican party.\r\n\r\nMr. George E. Adams, and Mr. George R. Davis who had served in\r\nCongress and been Director General of the World's Columbian Exposition\r\nat Chicago, were candidates against me.  Mr. Joseph E. Medill, the\r\nowner of _The Chicago Tribune_, also considered the question whether\r\nhe would be a candidate.  He advised with the late Hon. John R.\r\nTanner, asking him if he thought that he (Medill) could be elected\r\nif he could secure the solid support of the Cook County delegation.\r\nMr. Tanner replied that he could not, that I had a sufficient number\r\nof votes in the country outside of Cook to defeat every candidate;\r\nwhereupon he declined to consider the possibility of election at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John R. Tanner managed my campaign.  He had served in the\r\nLegislature, where he had been a very influential member, and was\r\nthen chairman of the State Central Committee.  He was popular and\r\npossessed shrewd political sagacity.  Tanner was very loyal to me\r\nthen, and for many years I considered him my closest and most\r\ndevoted political friend.  I have always had the firm conviction\r\nthat if he had remained loyal and had supported me for re-election\r\nin 1900, he would have been re-elected Governor himself, and would\r\nhave succeeded the late John M. Palmer as my colleague in the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature met in January, 1895.  I secured the caucus nomination,\r\nand on January 22, in the joint session of the Thirty-ninth General\r\nAssembly, I was elected the third time to succeed myself in the\r\nUnited States Senate.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of very complimentary speeches made on that\r\noccasion.  My old friend, the Hon. David T. Littler, who then\r\nrepresented the Springfield District in the Senate, made the first\r\nspeech.  He began by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President:  Twelve years ago, from my seat as a member of the\r\nLower House of this General Assembly, I had the honor to place in\r\nnomination as the candidate of the Republican party for the great\r\noffice of United States Senator, the Hon. Shelby M. Cullom.  I took\r\noccasion at that time to predict that in the office to which he\r\nhad been elected he would show his usefulness and increase his\r\nreputation not only among the people of our own State, but the\r\nwhole people of this country.  After the lapse of twelve years and\r\nwith his record perfectly familiar to the people of the whole\r\ncountry, I ask you Senators whether my prediction has not been\r\nfulfilled.  His name has been connected with every important measure\r\nintroduced in the United States Senate; and his discussion of\r\nimportant questions there on many occasions testified as to his\r\npatriotism and as to his ability as a statesman.  I take great\r\npleasure on this occasion to place in nomination for that high\r\noffice the same Shelby M. Cullom who has served the people of this\r\nState so long and so creditably.  In doing so I believe I state\r\nbut the truth when I say he has the longest and most distinguished\r\nrecord in public life of any man who ever lived in the State of\r\nIllinois.\"\r\n\r\nSpeeches were made in the Senate by Senators Coon, Aspinwall, and\r\nMussett; and in the House of Representatives William J. Butler, of\r\nSpringfield, E. Callahan, George W. Miller, D. S. Berry, A. J.\r\nDougherty, J. E. Sharrock, and Charles E. Selby.\r\n\r\nI was present in Springfield, and was invited before the joint\r\nsession of the General Assembly, after they had elected me, to\r\ndeliver an address.  I appeared before the joint session and\r\nexpressed my obligations to the members of the Thirty-sixth General\r\nAssembly for the high honor conferred upon me.  I made a short\r\naddress, reviewing conditions in the State and the country generally,\r\nand concluded by saying:\r\n\r\n\"The prosperity and happiness of the people depend upon wise and\r\njust laws to be enacted both by the State and by the Nation.  In\r\nthe discharge of the high duty which you have just imposed upon\r\nme, it shall be my single aim to dy my part in so shaping the policy\r\nof the country, that we shall soon stand upon the high ground of\r\npermanent prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, it should be our ambition so to legislate that the\r\nfreedom and rights of every citizen shall be secured and respected;\r\nthat all interests shall be protected; that one portion of our\r\npeople shall not oppress another, and so that ample remedies shall\r\nbe found and applied for every existing wrong.  To this end an\r\nenlarged humanity bids us look forward with renewed hope and trust.\"\r\n\r\nMy reference to the Hon. Joseph E. Medill in connection with this\r\ncontest reminds me that I should say something of Mr. Medill.  I\r\nregarded him as one of the three really great editors of his day--\r\nHorace Greeley, Henry Watterson, and Joe Medill.\r\n\r\nHe made _The Chicago Tribune_ one of the most influential newspapers\r\nof the United States.  At time Medill and I were very friendly,\r\nand he gave me his hearty support.  At other times he was against\r\nme, but we always remained on speaking terms at least, and I admired\r\nand respected him very much.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the most indefatigable and inveterate letter-writers\r\nwithin my experience.  From the time I was Governor of Illinois,\r\nand even before that, and almost to the time of his death, he wrote\r\nme at great length upon every conceivable public question.  His\r\nletters were always interesting, but as he did not avail himself\r\nof a stenographer, and as he wrote a very difficult hand to read,\r\nthey became at times a trifle tiresome.  I have retained a large\r\nnumber of his letters, and as they are so characteristic of the\r\nman I venture to quote a few of them.\r\n\r\n  \"The Chicago Tribune, Editorial Rooms.\r\n  \"_Feb. 6, 1887_.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. S. M. Cullom,\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--\r\n\r\n\"Well, he signed the bill, and it out of the woods.  All right so\r\nfar.  His signing it shows that he is a candidate for a second\r\nterm.  That was the test.  The next thing is the composition of\r\nthe Board of Commissioners.  The successful working of the law\r\ndepends upon the action of the Board.  There is an impression that\r\nhe will probably let you name one of the commissioners and Reagan\r\nanother.  If that be so, let me suggest among other names Mr. C.\r\nM. Wicker, manager Chicago Freight Bureau, for the position.  You\r\nprobably know him.  He has had large experience in freighting, and\r\nis widely known to both shippers and railroad men, and is well\r\nliked.  He is a friend of the law, and supported it vigorously\r\nwhile before Congress, writing some good letters in its explanation\r\nand defence for _The Tribune_.  He is a sound Republican though\r\nnot much of a politician.  You may find other and better men to\r\nrecommend, but I don't think of any belonging to this State at this\r\nmoment.  I hear Judge Cooley's name mentioned.  He is of course a\r\nfirst-class A No. 1 man, but I write on the hypothesis that your\r\npreference will be for an Illinois man if you are allowed to have\r\na say in it.\r\n\r\n\"The passage of the bill is a great triumph for you, if the bill\r\nworks well.  People always judge of measures by their effect; hence\r\nthe act should have fair play.\r\n\r\n\"Now that it is safely in the shape of a law, I thought _The Tribune_\r\nmight indulge in a little horn-blowing as per enclosed article,\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n  \"(Signed) J. Medill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Hotel Ponce de Leon,\r\n  \"St. Augustine, Fla.,\r\n  \"_March 13, 1888_.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. S. M. Cullom,\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir:--\r\n\r\n\"I have just received your favor of 9 inst. and confess that I am\r\ntaken a little by surprise.  I had got the impression from various\r\nquarters that you did not desire to secure the Illinois delegation,\r\nand did not want to be considered a candidate.  Acting on this idea\r\n_The Tribune_ has been leaning towards Gresham as an available\r\ncandidate, as you have noticed.  However, you have lost no ground\r\nby standing in the shade.  If I was managing your boom I would keep\r\nyour name in the background and out of the newspapers as a candidate\r\nseeking the nomination until the last.  A few strong judicious\r\nfriends among the Illinois delegation is all you want to watch\r\nevents and move quickly at the opportune moment, if it arrives.\r\nI should say that on general principles you would be the second\r\nchoice of any set of Illinois delegates and the chances are all in\r\nthe direction of some second-choice candidate.  Harrison is likely\r\nto have a pledged delegation from Indiana, but what good will it\r\ndo him?  Logan had a pledged delegation from Illinois; Sherman,\r\nfrom Ohio; Windom, from Minn.; and Hawley, from Conn.  The convention\r\nwill be largely chiefly actuated and governed by the stability\r\nidea.  Personal friendship won't count for much in that search for\r\nthe most available candidate.  This you see as clearly as I do.\r\nWhatever Western man the New York delegates (or a majority of them)\r\nfavor will stand a good chance of getting it.  It is almost impossible\r\nto figure out a victory without the electoral vote of New York.\r\nIndiana and Connecticut would be absolutely indispensable in the\r\nabsence of New York.  But even then we have doubtful States that\r\nvoted for Blaine.  Michigan, for instance, and the three Pacific\r\nCoast States, in case any such man as Sherman, Harrison, or Hawley,\r\nwho voted against restricting Chinese immigration, should be\r\nnominated.  And then it remains to be seen what sort of action will\r\nbe had in Congress on tariff reduction.  If we are obliged to go\r\nbefore the people defending the present tariff, that is breeding\r\ntrust monopolies all over the country, a nomination will not be\r\nworth having.  High protection is a nice thing for those who pocket\r\nit, but not so fascinating to the unprotected classes who have to\r\npay the big bounties out of their pockets sold at free trade prices.\r\nAll those things must be taken into consideration.  I am about\r\nleaving Florida for home, either via Atlantic or Washington.  If\r\nthe latter, I shall see you when I get there, when we can talk over\r\nthe whole matter more fully than on paper.  All I can really say\r\nis, I am peering about in the dark for the strongest candidate,\r\nthe most available man on an available platform, and even then we\r\nshall have desperate hard work to win in the face of the immense\r\nlosses our party is suffering from the ravages in the rank and\r\nfile, committed by the prohibitionists.  We shall have to face a\r\nloss of fifty thousand in New York.  How is that to be made good?\r\nand twenty-five to thirty thousand in Illinois and five to seven\r\nthousand in Indiana, and thirty thousand in Michigan.  How can we\r\nstand this loss of blood and men?\r\n\r\n  \"(Signed) J. Medill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Niagara Falls, N. Y.,\r\n  \"_Aug. 5, 1888_.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir:--\r\n\r\n\"Searching for a cool place I found it here, where I shall remain\r\na few days and then proceed to Kaetershill Mountain top, which is\r\nthe best hot-weather place I found last year.\r\n\r\n\"I take it for granted that none of your friends keep you posted\r\nabout the secret negotiations going on between Palmer and the\r\nSocialistic Labor element for a fusion.  You have seen by _The\r\nTribune_ that all the labor element is not disposed to support\r\nPalmer, in consideration of his pardoning the imprisoned anarchists.\r\nYou may rely on _The Tribune_ ventilating this unholy alliance.\r\nAt the same time there are ten thousand to twelve thousand of these\r\nsocialists who will vote for Palmer and the Democratic ticket in\r\nCook County; and this fusion may with the aid of the prohibitionists\r\ncost the Republicans second seats in the Legislature, which is the\r\nphase of the matter in which you are specially interested.  There\r\nis considerable coldness among the Irish Catholics toward Cleveland,\r\nbut whether it will continue until election night remains to be\r\nseen.  They think he is too pro-English, but they dislike Harrison.\r\nBlaine was their ideal.\r\n\r\n\"I have spent a good deal of spare time to point out flaws and\r\ntricks in the sugar and whiskey sections of the Mills bill.  The\r\nlatter really opens and invites universal evasion of taxes and the\r\nmultiplication of small moonshine distilleries; and the former\r\nperpetuates the sugar trust profits and affords the public no\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\"The Republican members of the House did not expose these defects\r\nenough.  Cannon did well on sugar, but nobody dissected the whiskey\r\nsection which bored gimlet holes into the bottom of every barrel\r\nof high wine to let it out without paying a cent of tax.  The\r\nDemocrats are therefore the real free whiskeyites.  This ought to\r\nbe shown up thoroughly in the Senate.  Our miserable platform places\r\nus on the defensive.  The Mills bill places the Democrats on the\r\ndefensive if it is rightly handled.  I do not mean attacking the\r\nfree wool part of it, for that portion if enacted would do your\r\nconstituents certainly ten or twenty times more good than harm,\r\nnor the free lumber or free salt or free soap, etc., etc., which\r\nwould benefit all Illinois; but I mean fraud free sugar, and fraud\r\nfree whiskey, and a hundred per cent tax on rice--these are the\r\nthings to hit.  On these the Democrats are placed with their noses\r\non the grindstone.\r\n\r\n\"I have been reading the discussion in the Senate over your resolution\r\nin regard to the competition of the Canadian railways with our\r\ntranscontinental railway freight charges.  It is well enough perhaps\r\nto inquire into the matter, but I have a notion that the sharp\r\ncompetition is of great benefit to the masses.  I know that I am\r\na little heterodox in looking at the interest of the consumers\r\ninstead of railroad plutocrats, of the millions instead of the\r\nmillionaires, but I can't help it.  Senator Gorman had much to say\r\nin his speech about the undue advantage the Canadian roads had over\r\nours by reason of Government subsidies received in constructing\r\nthe Canadian railways, and to a line of steamers from Victoria to\r\nJapan and Hongkong.  But his memory failed in the most astonishing\r\nmanner to recall and perceive the fact that all the American roads\r\nwest of the Mississippi to the Pacific have been enormously subsidized\r\nby our Government.  In fact the subsidies amount to a good deal\r\nmore than the actual total cost of the construction of the whole\r\nof them.  For twenty years some of these roads have been plundering\r\nthe American people by the most outrageous charges, and Congress,\r\nthe people's representatives, have not lifted a finger to stop the\r\nrapacious robbery.  And now, when the Canadian road, built by\r\nGovernment subsidies, begins to compete with the American roads\r\nbuilt with Government subsidies, the latter who have pocketed\r\nhundreds of millions of subsidy spoils and overcharge plunder,\r\nappeal to the Senate to protect the scoundrels against a little\r\nhealthy competition, and Senator Gorman pleads for the robbers on\r\nthe floor of the Senate with tears in his eyes!  So whatever extent\r\nthe competing Canadian roads cause our contiguous roads to lower\r\ntheir freights so much the better for the public.  They act just\r\nthe same as competing waterways.  The Grand Trunk, beginning at\r\nChicago and running through Michigan to Sarma; crossing at Niagara\r\nFalls and feeding the Lackawanna and Erie to New York; running to\r\nBoston through Vermont, etc., and also to Montreal; and the Alden\r\nline of steamers carrying cattle to England, as a healthy competition\r\nwith our pooling trunk lines east from Chicago, is of enormous\r\nvalue to Chicago and all the shippers, cattle-dealers, grain-raises,\r\nfarmers, and merchants of half a dozen States in the Northwest.\r\nAny interference with its competitive activity will harm millions\r\nof Western people, tending as it will to increase cost of transportation\r\nand re-establish trunk line pooling monopoly.\r\n\r\n\"So the competition of the Canadian transcontinental at the Red\r\nRiver and at the '500' ensures cheaper freights for all Minnesota\r\nand Dakota, and the effect extends clear down into Nebraska and\r\nIowa.  So, too, the Canadian road's rates at its Pacific terminal\r\n--Victoria--are exercising a most beneficent and ameliorating\r\ninfluence on the charges of the enormously subsidized Northern\r\nPacific, forcing down to a reasonable rate Pacific Coast; and as\r\nit climbs down from its extortionate schedule of charges the Union\r\nand Central and Southern and Santa Fe Pacifics will be forced to\r\ndo likewise.  I'd give something handsome to have had the opportunity\r\nto reply for thirty minutes to Senator Gorman, to present the other\r\nside of the question from the American standpoint.  On one point\r\nI am in agreement with you, viz.:  that the British flag should be\r\nremoved from this continent.  This territory along our northern\r\nborder should be incorporated into the American Union.  It is\r\nridiculous that Uncle Sam should allow a foreign power to hold it.\r\nWe have as much need for it and right to it as England has for\r\nScotland.  If we had a respectable navy and a supply of fortification\r\nguns the problem would be easy of solution, and won't be until then.\r\n\r\n\"Each day convinces me more and stronger that if we lose this\r\nelection McKinley--will be the cause.  They make the party say in\r\nits platform 'Rather than surrender any part of our protective\r\nsystem, the whiskey, tobacco, and oleomargarine excises shall be\r\nrepealed.'  The Democrats are making much capital out of this.\r\nThe tax on lumber and on salt are parts of our 'protective system.'\r\nNow the Mc. plank discloses that rather than reduce the tax on\r\nlumber, the Rep. party will repeal the tax on oleo butter.  How\r\nmany farmers' votes will that give us?  Rather than allow any\r\nlowering of the high taxes on clothes, or salt, or lumber or\r\ncrockery, etc., the tax on whiskey must be repealed, and the old\r\nevil era of cheap rotgut and still-houses everywhere shall be\r\nrestored!  Do you really think that position will make votes for\r\nus this fall among the farmers?  The final outcome will probably\r\nturn on the character of the Senate bill, of which I am not sanguine.\r\nAbout two thousand millionaires run the policies of the Rep. party\r\nand make its tariffs.  What modifications will they permit the Rep.\r\nSenators to support?  We other thirty million of Republicans will\r\nhave precious little voice in the matter.  Turn this over in your\r\nmind, and you will see that I am right.  Whatever duties protect\r\nthe two thousand plutocrats is protection to American industries.\r\nWhatever don't is free trade.\r\n\r\n  \"(Signed) J. Medill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The Windsor, N.

I knew that a storm was coming, but did not\r\ndream that its severity would be so dreadful.\r\n\r\n\"The thing to do this Winter is to repeal the McKinley bill, and\r\nstrengthen the reciprocity scheme by giving Blaine the sugar duties\r\nto work on--freeing no sugar before reciprocal equivalents are\r\nsecured from respective cane-sugar tropical countries; or (2) fail\r\nto pass the chief appropriation bills, so that an extra session of\r\nthe Dem.

Times_ for\r\nRepublicans.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n  \"(Signed) J. Medill.\"\r\n\r\nI was elected to the Senate, the fourth time, in January, 1901.\r\nThis time I had a very serious contest.  More opposition had\r\ndeveloped, and there were more strong men against me, than at any\r\nprevious election.  This was largely the outgrowth of the opposition\r\nof the late Governor Tanner, who had just completed his term as\r\nGovernor of Illinois, and who had announced he would not be a\r\ncandidate for renomination, but would be a candidate to succeed\r\nme.  I believe it was mainly through the efforts of Governor Tanner\r\nand his friends that the Hon. Robert R. Hitt, the Hon. Joseph G.\r\nCannon, and the Hon. George W. Prince were induced to become\r\ncandidates, in the hope of weakening me in their respective districts.\r\nI do not believe that either Mr. Hitt or Mr. Cannon was a party to\r\nany particular scheme to defeat me.  They were candidates in good\r\nfaith, and aspired to the office of United States Senator, but\r\nneither of them had any desire to defeat me unless he could get\r\nthe office himself.\r\n\r\nThe campaign continued for a year or more.  My friends were active,\r\nas were the friends of Governor Tanner.  He had a horde of office-\r\nholders whom he had given places while Governor, who had been more\r\nor less actively working for him as my successor almost from the\r\nvery time that the Governor entered that office.  The bitter personal\r\nattacks made on me by the Governor and his friends did not help\r\nhim, but tended rather to help me.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary contest was in the State Convention held at Peoria\r\nin 1900.  There were a number of candidates for Governor before\r\nthat convention.  The Hon. Walter Reeves, the Hon. O. H. Carter,\r\nand Judge Elbridge Hanecy were the leading aspirants.  My friends\r\nhad insisted that I should be endorsed for re-election by the State\r\nConvention, and my friends controlled the organization of the\r\nconvention and elected the Hon. Charles G. Dawes temporary chairman\r\nand the Hon. Joseph W. Fifer permanent chairman.\r\n\r\nGovernor Fifer has always been my friend, as I have always been\r\nhis.  He was a brave, gallant soldier in the Civil War, in which\r\nhe served as a private until he was so badly wounded that his life\r\nwas despaired of.  He has been forced to go through life under\r\nexceptionally difficult circumstances, never fully recovering from\r\nhis wound.  He is entitled to far more than ordinary credit for\r\nthe success which he achieved in life.  He is an able lawyer, and\r\nas State's Attorney he was one of the most vigorous of prosecutors.\r\nHe was nominated and elected Governor, and gave the State an honest\r\nand capable administration.  He was renominated, but local questions\r\nin the State, combined with the Democratic landslide of 1892,\r\nresulted in his defeat.  President McKinley, on my recommendation,\r\nappointed Governor Fifer a member of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, in which position he served with credit for some years.\r\nHe resigned voluntarily and returned to his home in Bloomington to\r\nresume the practice of law.  I have always liked Governor Fifer,\r\nand consider him one of the foremost citizens of the State living\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Peoria Convention, over which Governor Fifer\r\npresided, I will only say that Mr. Reeves had the votes in that\r\nconvention to be nominated; but for reasons I do not have to discuss,\r\nhe did not secure the nomination, and the Hon. Richard Yates became\r\nthe nominee.  I was endorsed by the convention as the candidate of\r\nthe Republican party to succeed myself as United States Senator.\r\nThe opposition to me in the convention was by Governor Tanner and\r\nhis friends, he being the only avowed candidate against me.  I\r\nthought that the endorsement of that convention should have settled\r\nthe matter; but the contest went on, and Messrs. Hitt, Cannon, and\r\nPrince entered it actively.  Several others were standing around\r\nwaiting for a chance, and this continued to be the situation until\r\nthe Legislature met in January.  A sufficient number of the members\r\nof the Legislature to elect me had pledged themselves in writing\r\nto stand by me as long as I was a candidate.  The other candidates,\r\nprobably aside from Governor Tanner, did not believe I had these\r\nwritten pledges.  I told them so, but they did not believe me.\r\nGovernor Tanner and his friends realized that I would have a majority\r\nof the caucus, and they then began scheming for the purpose of\r\nhaving a secret ballot in the caucus, hoping that if certain members\r\nwho had been pledged to me would not have to vote openly, they\r\nwould go back on the pledges and vote secretly for one of the other\r\ncandidates, thus defeating me.  I had enough votes to defeat the\r\nsecret ballot proposition, as many of the supporters of Tanner were\r\nreally in favor of my re-election.  Hon. Fred A. Busse, one of the\r\nmost influential members of the State Senate at that time, and more\r\nrecently Mayor of Chicago--one of the best the city ever had--and\r\nwho has long been my personal friend, was pledged to vote for the\r\nGovernor, but at heart was strongly for me.  With many others,\r\nBusse would not consent to a secret caucus, and this really ended\r\nthe contest.  Tanner, after trying to induce the other candidates\r\nto unite on him, or on some one else to defeat me (which proposition\r\nMr. Cannon and Mr. Hitt rejected), announced that he would withdraw.\r\nFriends of the Governor in the Legislature came to me and announced\r\nthat Tanner had quit the race, and later Mr. Cannon and Mr. Hitt\r\ncame to my room and announced their withdrawal.\r\n\r\nThis ended the contest; my name was the only one presented to the\r\ncaucus, and I was the only Republican voted for in the joint session\r\nof the Legislature.  It was an interesting fight, and as it may\r\nwell be supposed, the result was very satisfactory to my friends\r\nand to me.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Washington after having been re-elected, I was\r\nwarmly greeted by my colleagues in the Senate who had been watching\r\nthe contest; and I recollect that Senator Hanna was particularly\r\nwarm in his congratulations, and remarked that it was the prettiest\r\npolitical fight he had witnessed in a long time.\r\n\r\nI want to say something in reference to the Hon. Joseph G. Cannon,\r\nwho was a candidate against me at this time, and who is now, as he\r\nhas been for years past, the leading member of the Illinois\r\ndelegation.\r\n\r\nI regard him as my personal friend, and was very glad indeed to\r\nsupport his candidacy for the Presidency in 1908, I being chairman\r\nof the Illinois delegation to the Chicago convention that year.\r\n\r\nAt the time he entered the contest against me, he had long been\r\none of the leaders of the House of Representatives in Congress.\r\nAfter refusing to enter the scheme of Governor Tanner to defeat\r\nme, as I have stated, he retired from the contest, was soon re-\r\nelected to Congress, and almost immediately elected as Speaker, in\r\nwhich position he continued for a larger number of consecutive\r\nterms than any statesman in our history.  He is a strong, courageous\r\nman, and a man of splendid ability.  He had rather a stormy career\r\nas Speaker, but he controlled the situation all the time.  During\r\nhis last term as Speaker he might have gotten along with the House\r\na little more smoothly, and at the same time just as satisfactorily\r\nto himself, if he had yielded a little to his colleagues in his\r\nparty who differed from him.  If he had been disposed to do so,\r\nmuch friction could have been avoided, and at the same time he\r\nwould have had his own way in caring for the interests of the\r\ncountry.  I have believed in him and have stood by him through\r\nthick and thin, and I know he has done nothing but what he himself\r\nbelieved right.\r\n\r\nJoseph G. Cannon has his own notions of what is right and what is\r\nwrong, and fearlessly follows what he thinks is right, without\r\nreference to what anybody else may think or say.  The apparently\r\ndetermined effort on the part of the masses of the people, and\r\nespecially the newspapers, to discredit the Payne-Aldrich Tariff\r\nBill resulted in the Democrats carrying the House in the campaign\r\nof 1910 with the result that in the Sixty-second Congress the\r\nDemocratic party has a substantial majority, causing the retirement\r\nof Mr. Cannon from the Speakership.\r\n\r\nFor a time Mr. Cannon was apparently very unpopular and the people\r\nseemed disposed to hold him responsible for much they did not\r\napprove of in legislation; but his feeling is passing away, and\r\nMr. Cannon will be regarded as an able legislator, an able Speaker,\r\na man who has during his service in Congress saved the Government\r\nuntold millions.  His honesty and devotion to duty cannot be doubted,\r\nand he will go down in history as one of the foremost leaders in\r\nCongress of his day, when those who are now criticising him are\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nOn January 16, 1907, I was by the Forty-fifth General Assembly\r\nelected for the fifth time as United States Senator from the State\r\nof Illinois.  This was an entirely different contest from any\r\nprevious one I had ever had, as the State had enacted a primary\r\nlaw which contained a proviso that the names of candidates for\r\nUnited States Senator could be placed on the ballot and voted for\r\nat the primaries, but that such vote was advisory merely.  This is\r\nas far as the primary law can go on the question of the election\r\nof United States Senators.  I had not the slightest objection to\r\nhaving my name go before the people, the individual voters, as a\r\ncandidate for the Senate.  The first primary law was declared\r\nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the State, and as soon as\r\nI heard the decision I promptly wired the Governor, commending him\r\nfor his announcement that he would call a special session of the\r\nLegislature to enact a new primary law, and I took occasion to add\r\nthat I hoped by friends would work with him in the passage of the\r\nlaw, and that it would provide for a vote on United States Senator.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature did enact a new law, providing that the primaries\r\nbe held in August, 1906.  Former Governor Richard Yates was the\r\nonly candidate against me.  He made a canvass of the State, and a\r\nvery thorough one.  He had a considerable advantage in that he had\r\nalmost all the politicians in the State who were holding State\r\noffices actively working for him.  I made no canvass and personally\r\ndid very little about it at all.  I was willing to leave the matter\r\nto the people, and determined, if it was a fair vote, to abide by\r\nthe result of the primaries, and if defeated at the primaries to\r\nsupport Governor Yates.  I believe that Governor Yates had the same\r\ndetermination,--at least his conduct after the primaries, in\r\nwithdrawing from the contest, would indicate that he had.  I am\r\nglad to be able to say that throughout the contest and at its close,\r\nhe acted very fairly.  He made a straight, fair fight, and lost,\r\nthen abided by the result, just as I would have done had I lost.\r\nMy friends in different parts of the State took an active interest\r\nin my behalf, for which I want to avail myself of this opportunity\r\nto express to them my appreciation.  I might add here that all\r\nduring my public career it has been my good fortune to have the\r\nsupport and friendship of a very high class of men, men whose honor\r\nand integrity were beyond question, and who were capable of filling\r\nany office.  I cannot undertake to name them, but I know that they\r\nwill understand the deep debt of gratitude that I owe to them.\r\n\r\nIt was very flattering to me that I carried the primaries by a\r\nsubstantial majority, having carried the popular vote, a majority\r\nof the Senatorial districts, and a majority of the Congressional\r\ndistricts.  It demonstrated to me that the people had confidence\r\nin me and were satisfied with my record as a Senator.  It was the\r\nfirst time that I had been voted for directly by the people for\r\nany office since my re-election as Governor in 1880.  The result\r\ncould not but be gratifying.\r\n\r\nEvery one in the State accepted the result of the primaries, and\r\nthe question was regarded as settled.  When the Legislature convened,\r\nI was the unanimous choice of the Republican caucus and was voted\r\nfor by every Republican in the Legislature on joint ballot.  There\r\nseemed to be no bitterness or hard feeling on the part of any one.\r\n\r\nAfter the general election in November, I returned to Washington\r\nto prepare for the session of Congress, and there was so much\r\nimportant work before my committee and in the Senate generally,\r\nthat it seemed impossible for me to leave there in order to thank\r\nthe members of the Legislature for the high honor they had conferred\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\nI addressed a letter to the members of the Forty-fifth General\r\nAssembly, which was read, and from which I will quote:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to express to the Republican members of the Forty-fifth\r\nGeneral Assembly my profound gratitude for your action in unanimously\r\ndeclaring in favor of my re-election to again represent Illinois\r\nin the United States Senate.\r\n\r\n\"In electing me to the United States Senate for five consecutive\r\nterms, a greater distinction will be conferred by the State than\r\nhas been conferred upon any other man in the history of Illinois.\r\n\r\n\"I shall appreciate this election the more, because for the first\r\ntime the question of the selection of a United States Senator was\r\nsubmitted to the people, and without any active campaign on my\r\npart, the great majority of the voters declared me to be their\r\npreference.\r\n\r\n\"Until the recent primaries, my name had not been submitted directly\r\nto the voters of the State since I was re-elected Governor in 1880,\r\nand it was no small gratification to me, after twenty-six years\r\nhad come and gone, to have this expression of continued confidence\r\nand approval of my record as a Senator.\r\n\r\n\"I wish now to return my most sincere thanks to the people of the\r\nState who have thus signally honored me.\r\n\r\n\"During the twenty-four years I have represented the State in the\r\nSenate, I have endeavored to the best of my ability to perform my\r\nwhole duty to the country and the State, and the only pledge I can\r\nmake is, that I shall continue in the performance of my duty in\r\nthe future as in the past.\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer to have the pleasure of being present when a\r\nSenatorial election takes place, in order to express personally to\r\nthe Legislature my appreciation; but there are so many important\r\nquestions to settle, and so much important legislation to enact\r\nduring the short session of Congress, ending as it does on March\r\n4, that it has seemed to me to be more in accord with my duty to\r\nremain in Washington in the performance of my official business.\r\n\r\n\"Your Legislature assembles this year in the midst of the greatest\r\nera of prosperity that has ever prevailed in this country.  There\r\nhas never been a time in our history that we have had so long an\r\nuninterrupted period of prosperity.  This prosperous and happy\r\ncondition has come as the result, in a large part, of Republican\r\nrule and Republican policy.\r\n\r\n\"For nearly forty-five years the history of the United States has\r\nbeen the history of the Republican party, because, with the exception\r\nof two short periods, Republican administration has guided the\r\ndestinies of the Nation; and the achievements of Republican\r\nadministrations during those forty-five years constitute the greatest\r\nrecord in our history, and that record is a complete defence of\r\nthe party against assaults from whatever quarter.\r\n\r\n\"We stand to-day at the head of all the Nations in the value of\r\nimports and exports, and these maintain the prosperity our country\r\nhas enjoyed since the American people declared in favor of a\r\nprotective tariff and a sound-money standard.\r\n\r\n\"The people do not prosper under vicious government.  Good government\r\nis essential to real prosperity, to properly develop and to advance\r\nit.  The Republican party has always secured for the Nation stability,\r\nconfidence and prosperity at home, and respect and prestige abroad.\r\n\r\n\"We are to-day at peace with all the Nations of the world.  Perhaps\r\nnever before in our history have we had such intimate and friendly\r\nrelations with all the great Nations as we have to-day.  Our country\r\nhas the respect of all the Governments of the world, great and\r\nsmall.  We are gradually assuming the first place among the naval\r\npowers; but, unlike the older Nations, we are acquiring a great\r\nnavy in the interest of peace.  Under the policy of this Government,\r\nsuch a navy is one of the surest assurances against war.  The\r\nNations know that the United States stands for peace, and under\r\nRoosevelt's Republican administration, greater progress has been\r\nmade in the direction of international arbitration as a means of\r\nsettling disputes among nations than under any other previous\r\nadministration in our history.\r\n\r\n\"While the nations know that we stand for peace, they also know\r\nthat we will not tamely submit to the imposition of wrong, or to\r\noffenses against our own honor and dignity, or to the oppression\r\nof our sister republics in this Western world.  We have no desire\r\nto rob these republics of their independence, or a single foot of\r\ntheir territory.  Our recent action in Cuba has been an object\r\nlesson to these republics, and to the world at large, of our\r\ndisinterested friendship.  As we have repeatedly assured them, our\r\nonly desire is that they shall follow us in peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"The construction of the great canal across the isthmus of Panama\r\nwill bind them closer to us, and at the same time will almost double\r\nour strength as a naval power.\r\n\r\n\"Too much credit cannot be given to President Roosevelt for the\r\ngreat and wonderful results which he has accomplished in the interest\r\nof the country, but the legislative branch of the Government has\r\ndone its full share.\r\n\r\n\"The record made during the last session of Congress in the enactment\r\nof wise laws for the direct benefit of the people has not been\r\nequalled since the Civil War--if at all, since the adoption of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\"I will not detain the caucus longer than to repeat my sincere\r\nobligations to you and to express through you my thanks to the\r\npeople of the State, whose representatives you are, for the signal\r\nhonor that has been conferred upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nGenerally I might say that I am quite content; but as I sit down\r\nnow in the evening time of my life, it is a source of sadness and\r\nwonder to me that I have survived both my wives and all of my\r\nchildren.  One by one I have laid them away in beautiful Oak Ridge\r\nCemetery, in Springfield, where I myself will one day be laid beside\r\nthem.  I have had a delightful home life; no man could have had a\r\nmore happy and peaceful one.  As I look back now, I cannot remember\r\nthat either wife or children ever caused me one moment's pain.  I\r\nwas twice married.  My first wife, Hannah M. Fisher, to whom I was\r\nmarried in 1855, and who died in 1861, was of a very amiable spirit,\r\na woman of more than ordinary culture, and was the mother of my\r\nfirst two children, Mrs. Ridgely and Mrs. Hardie, who lived to\r\nwomanhood, but both of whom have passed away.  My second wife,\r\nJulia Fisher, was the sister of my first wife.  No better or truer\r\nwoman ever lived.  She was a devoted helpmate to me during all the\r\nyears that I have occupied high public office and needed the support\r\nand help of a woman.  She did her full part and filled her place\r\non every occasion with dignity and propriety.  It seems that her\r\ndeath is the last great sorrow I shall have to bear.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the children whom I lost in their infancy is naturally\r\ndimmed by the passage of time, but it is hard for me to understand\r\nthe justice of things when I remember the death of my two daughters,\r\nElla, wife of William Barret Ridgely, and Carrie, wife of Robert\r\nGordon Hardie, who were taken just in the very prime of womanhood,\r\njust in the most beautiful period of a woman's life, and just at\r\na time when they had the most to live for.\r\n\r\nAs I think of it now, I do not know where I obtained the strength\r\nto survive all these sorrows.  I have no great fear of death, except\r\nthe natural dread of the physical pain which usually accompanies\r\nit.  I certainly wish beyond any words I have power to express that\r\nI could have greater assurance that there will be a reuniting with\r\nthose we love and those who have loved us in some future world;\r\nbut from my reading of Scripture, and even admitting that there is\r\na hereafter, I cannot find any satisfactory evidence to warrant\r\nsuch a belief.  Could I believe that I should meet the loved ones\r\nwho have gone before, I do not know but that I should look forward\r\nwith pleasure to the \"passing across.\"  Not having this belief, I\r\nam quite content to stay where I am as long as I can; and finally,\r\nwhen old Charon appears to row me over the river Styx, I shall be\r\nready to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX [omitted]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Fifty Years of Public Service, by Shelby M.
