It is, therefore, a fit time to present\r\nsome record of events in which His Royal Highness has taken part, and of\r\nservices rendered by him to the nation, during the past quarter of a\r\ncentury. The best and the least formal way of doing this seemed to be\r\nthe reproduction of his Speeches and Addresses, along with some account\r\nof the occasions when they were delivered.\r\n\r\nSome of these speeches, in more recent years, are known to all, and\r\ntheir importance is universally recognised; such as those relating to\r\nthe various International Exhibitions, the foundation of the Royal\r\nCollege of Music, and the establishment of the Imperial Institute. But\r\nthroughout the whole of the twenty-five years, there has been a\r\nsuccession of speeches, on all manner of occasions, of many of which\r\nthere is no adequate record or remembrance. It is only due to the Prince\r\nto recall the various services thus rendered by him, especially during\r\nthose earlier years when the loss of the Prince Consort was most deeply\r\nfelt, and when the Queen, whose Jubilee has been so splendidly\r\ncelebrated, was living in retirement. A new generation has come on the\r\nstage since those days, and there are comparatively few who remember the\r\nnumber and variety of occasions upon which Royalty was worthily\r\nrepresented by the Prince of Wales, and the important and arduous duties\r\nvoluntarily and cheerfully undertaken by him.\r\n\r\nBefore carrying out this design, it was advisable to ascertain if there\r\nmight be any objection on the part of the Prince of Wales. There might,\r\nfor instance, be a purpose of official publication of these speeches. On\r\nthe matter being referred to the Prince, he not only made no objection,\r\nbut, in most kind and gracious terms, gave his sanction to the work, and\r\nhoped it might be \"useful to the various objects which he had publicly\r\nadvocated and supported.\"\r\n\r\nThe number and diversity of occasions on which the Prince has made these\r\npublic appearances will surprise those who have not personal\r\nrecollection of them. The speeches themselves will surprise no one. The\r\nPrince has had education and culture such as few of any station obtain;\r\ndirected at first by such a father as the Prince Consort, and by tutors\r\nwho carried out the design of both his parents. Accomplished in Art, and\r\ninterested in Science, in Antiquities, and most branches of learning;\r\nwith some University training at Oxford, Cambridge, and Edinburgh, and\r\nwith his mind enlarged by foreign travel, we might expect the fruits of\r\nsuch training to appear in his public addresses. Add to this the\r\nkindliness which comes from a good natural disposition, the sympathetic\r\ninfluence of a genial manner, and the grace which is given by a training\r\nfrom childhood in the highest station, and we can understand how the\r\nspeeches even of the earliest years were heard with pleasure and\r\napproval. Some of the speeches are very brief, but are always to the\r\npoint, and present the gist of the subject in hand. It was Earl\r\nGranville who once said, in proposing his health, that, \"if the speeches\r\nof His Royal Highness were usually short, they were always, to use a\r\nhomely expression, as full of meat as an egg.\" Even where there has been\r\nno formal speech, we are interested in knowing what the Prince has done\r\nas well as what he has said; and therefore some important occasions are\r\nincluded when no speech was made.\r\n\r\nIt is the variety of subjects that will strike most readers. Let it be\r\nnoted, moreover, that the speeches now reproduced are only those\r\naddressed to meetings where reporters for the press were present. There\r\nhave been innumerable meetings besides,--meetings of Commissions, of\r\nBoards, of Councils, of Committees, at none of which has the Prince ever\r\nbeen an inactive or silent member, but rather the guiding and moving\r\nspirit. If the voluntary offices of His Royal Highness were printed at\r\nlength, they would far outnumber those mere honorary titles with which\r\nthe College of Arms concerns itself; and are such as imply thought and\r\nwork, in many useful and beneficent ways.\r\n\r\nLong may His Royal Highness have the health and the will for such\r\noffices and duties. If his future career is equal to the hopes and\r\npromise of his early life, and the performances of the last twenty-five\r\nyears, he will leave a name illustrious and memorable in the history of\r\nthe British Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[***symbol] _The frontispiece portrait, under which the Prince of\r\nWales has been pleased to put his autograph, is etched by W.

From\r\nWindsor, to which the Court removed on the 6th of December, the Queen\r\nwrote next day to King Leopold, \"We arrived here safe and sound, with\r\nour awfully large nursery establishment, yesterday morning.... I wonder\r\nvery much whom our little boy will be like. You will understand how\r\nfervent are my prayers, and I am sure everybody's must be, to see him\r\nresemble his father in every respect, both in body and mind.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, named Albert Edward, was baptized in St. George's Chapel,\r\nWindsor, on the 25th of January, 1842. King Frederick William of Prussia\r\nwas invited to be the boy's Godfather, and he came over personally to\r\nundertake the office. The other Sponsors, six in number, were members of\r\nthe Houses of Saxe-Coburg and Saxe-Gotha, and of the English Royal\r\nfamily. There was a full choral service at the christening. A special\r\nanthem had been composed by Sir George Elvey. On the Prince Consort\r\nbeing told of this, and asked when it should be sung, he answered, \"Not\r\nat all; no anthem. If the service ends by an anthem we shall all go out\r\ncriticising the music. We will have something we all know--something in\r\nwhich we can all join--something devotional. The Hallelujah Chorus; we\r\nshall all join in that, with our hearts.\" The Hallelujah Chorus ended\r\nthe service accordingly. The incident is noteworthy, as showing how the\r\ninfant Prince was committed, at his baptism, not in outward form only,\r\nbut in devout spirit, to the care of the Heavenly Father.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen told King Leopold of the removal of the Court to Windsor,\r\nshe had made special mention of \"the nursery establishment.\" No mother\r\nin any rank of life ever paid greater attention to this part of the\r\nhome, wherever the Court might be. In Memoirs and Recollections of the\r\nQueen, by those who have belonged to her household, many anecdotes are\r\nfound which show the watchful care and the personal superintendence of\r\nthe Royal Mother.\r\n\r\nIt is only this year, in the autumn of 1888, that Mrs. Hull, who entered\r\nHer Majesty's service as nurse to the Prince of Wales, died, in her\r\nseventy-ninth year. She was a kind and conscientious attendant to every\r\none of the Royal children, and the Queen ever retained great regard for\r\nthe faithful nurse--\"Dear old May,\" as she used to call her. When she\r\nretired from the Royal service, and lived in recent years in Windsor,\r\nshe was always welcome at the Castle. The Queen herself and the\r\nPrincesses often saw her, and the Prince of Wales frequently brought her\r\nhandsome presents. In reading the account of her funeral, it is pleasant\r\nto see that on the card attached to one of the many wreaths laid on her\r\ncoffin were the words: \"A mark of affection and gratitude from Victoria\r\nR. I.\" A beautiful wreath sent by the Prince and Princess of Wales bore\r\nthe inscription: \"In remembrance of dear old May.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Royal children came to be under governesses and teachers, they\r\nwere taught well the usual branches of early education, and were also\r\ntrained in practical ways, the boys in the use of tools, and the girls\r\nin household work, especially when the Swiss Cottage at Osborne was\r\noccupied by the young folk.\r\n\r\nIn the story of the 'Early Years of the Prince Consort' there is an\r\namusing reference to the interruptions of the schoolroom studies by the\r\nold Duke of Saxe-Coburg, who loved to carry off the two boys, and take\r\nthem on excursions. The Prince himself did this sometimes, as when the\r\ntwo elder children, in the autumn of 1846, were taken with their parents\r\nin the _Victoria and Albert_ to Portland, Weymouth, Guernsey, Dartmouth,\r\nand Plymouth, between August 8th and 25th; and to Jersey, Falmouth, St.\r\nMichael's Mount, and the Duchy of Cornwall, between September 2nd and\r\n9th. Of these excursions details are given in the Queen's 'Leaves from a\r\nJournal.' The Queen tells how, at several places off the Cornish coast,\r\n\"boats crowded round us in all directions, and when Bertie showed\r\nhimself the people shouted, 'Three cheers for the Duke of Cornwall!'\"\r\n... In the Journal, under date September 7th, Prince Albert having that\r\nday landed to visit some mines, the Queen has this entry, \"The\r\nCorporation of Penryn were on board, and very anxious to see the Duke of\r\nCornwall, so I stepped out of the pavilion with Bertie, and Lord\r\nPalmerston told them that that was the Duke of Cornwall; and the old\r\nMayor of Penryn said that 'he hoped he would grow up to be a blessing to\r\nhis parents, and to his country.'\"\r\n\r\nOn September the 2nd, on the evening of the day when the Royal yacht\r\nleft Osborne for the Channel Islands, \"Bertie put on his sailor's dress,\r\nwhich was beautifully made by the man on board who makes for our\r\nsailors. When he appeared, the officers and sailors, who were all\r\nassembled on deck to see him, cheered, and seemed delighted with him.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1847 there was another holiday journey, this time to Scotland, the\r\nQueen and the Prince taking with them, as before, the two eldest\r\nchildren, with Miss Hildyard, their governess. They embarked at Osborne,\r\nin the Royal yacht, on the 11th of August. On the 14th they were at\r\nPembroke, when the dockyard and the castle were inspected: thence along\r\nthe coast of Wales, landing at Bangor, from whence there was an\r\nexpedition to Penryn Castle, and thence past the Isle of Man to the\r\nScottish coast. Of this journey a detailed account is given in a letter\r\nto Baron Stockmar. At Rothesay in the Isle of Bute, the Prince Consort\r\nsays, \"The people were as much rejoiced to see the Duke of Rothesay as\r\nthe Welsh were to salute the Prince of Wales on their native ground.\" It\r\nwas this enthusiasm about local associations that led the Queen, after\r\nthe first visit to Ireland, to desire for the Prince the title of Earl\r\nof Dublin.\r\n\r\nDuring 1848 and the following year there was much in the state of public\r\naffairs, at home and abroad, to occupy the attention of the Queen and\r\nthe Prince Consort, but they were anxiously considering the plans for\r\nthe future education of the Prince of Wales. In May 1848 negociations\r\nhad been opened with Mr. Birch, who had been highly recommended as\r\ntutor. In the spring of 1849 the appointment was made, and Prince\r\nAlbert, in a letter to the Dowager Duchess of Gotha, dated Windsor\r\nCastle, 10th April, thus wrote, \"The children grow more than well.\r\nBertie will be given over in a few weeks into the hands of a tutor, whom\r\nwe have found in Mr. Birch, a young, good-looking, amiable man, who was\r\na tutor at Eton, and who not only himself took the highest honours at\r\nCambridge, but whose pupils have won especial distinction. It is an\r\nimportant step, and God's blessing be upon it, for upon the good\r\neducation of Princes, and especially of those who are destined to\r\ngovern, the welfare of the world in these days very greatly depends.\"\r\n\r\nOf the course and conduct of the studies of the Prince, under Mr. Birch,\r\nfrom 1849-1851, and under his successor, Mr. Gibbs, from 1851-1858, it\r\nis not necessary to speak. His other teachers were efficient in their\r\ndepartments, such as Mr. Corbould, who taught drawing to all the Royal\r\nchildren; and M. Brasseur, the French teacher, to whom the Prince paid a\r\nvisit when in Paris in 1888. As in the earlier years, so when he was\r\nunder tutors, the real education for public life was less in study than\r\nin the companionship and the example of his parents. A man of wide\r\nknowledge and of varied accomplishments like the Prince Consort had\r\nhigher views of education than mere scholastic routine. He took his son\r\nto all places where a love of arts and sciences might be encouraged and\r\nfostered, and hence the Prince obtained knowledge and acquired tastes\r\nnot universal among young Englishmen, in times before the subjects of\r\nacademic training and honours had been enlarged, mainly through the\r\ninfluence of the Prince Consort, as Chancellor of the University of\r\nCambridge. From his father also he inherited the taste for music which\r\nhas been since turned to national benefit. But above all, he was often\r\ntaken to meetings and festivals connected with charitable institutions,\r\na Princely duty in which the son has been proud to follow the example of\r\nhis lamented father.\r\n\r\nThe extra-scholastic education of the Prince was continued throughout\r\nthe time that Mr. Gibbs, his classical tutor, remained with him. He was\r\nalso gradually introduced to public life, and initiated in affairs of\r\nmodern as well as ancient history,--events reported in the newspapers of\r\nthe day, as well as those recorded by the historians of antiquity. As\r\nearly as the 3rd of April, 1854, when the Addresses from both Houses of\r\nParliament were presented to the Queen, in answer to Her Majesty's\r\nmessage announcing the opening of war with Russia, we are told that \"the\r\nPrince of Wales took his place, for the first time, beside the Queen and\r\nPrince Albert upon the throne.\" In the succeeding years these\r\nappearances in public were frequent, and in 1857 he accompanied the\r\nQueen and the Prince on their memorable visit to the Art Treasures\r\nExhibition at Manchester. The Princess Royal, the Princess Alice, Prince\r\nGeorge, and Prince Frederick William of Prussia, were also guests at\r\nWorsley Hall during this visit. In Manchester, as recorded by the Queen\r\nin her Diary, \"The crowd was enormous, greater than ever witnessed\r\nbefore, and enthusiastic beyond belief--nothing but kind and friendly\r\nfaces.\" Upwards of a million people were computed to have been in the\r\nstreets that day. Not only were the treasures of the Exhibition\r\ncarefully inspected, but visits were paid to some of the great\r\nmanufacturing works of the town. On the day that the Queen drove to see\r\nthe statue of herself recently erected in the Peel Park, the Prince\r\nConsort, with his two eldest sons, and Prince Frederick William, went to\r\nthe Manchester Town Hall, to receive the address which the Corporation\r\npresented to the Prussian Prince on his approaching marriage with the\r\nPrincess Royal.\r\n\r\nIn July of that year, 1857, the Prince of Wales went to Königswinter,\r\nfor the purposes of study. He was accompanied by General Grey, Sir Henry\r\nPonsonby, and several companions, among whom were Mr. C. Wood, son of\r\nLord Halifax, Lord Cadogan, and Mr. F. Stanley, son of Lord Derby. With\r\nMr. Gibbs was now associated the Rev. Canon Tarver, who, on the\r\nretirement of Mr. Gibbs in 1858, was appointed Director of Studies and\r\nChaplain. In this capacity he accompanied the Prince to Rome, Spain, and\r\nPortugal, and afterwards went with him to Edinburgh, remaining with the\r\nPrince till the autumn of 1859, when his education ceased to be\r\nconducted at home.\r\n\r\nOf the principal events of the year 1858 as regards the Prince, a most\r\ninteresting statement is given in a letter of his father to his old\r\nfriend Stockmar. It is dated Windsor Castle, April 2nd. \"Yesterday the\r\nConfirmation of the Prince of Wales went off with great solemnity, and I\r\nhope with lasting impression on his mind. The previous day his\r\nexamination took place before the Archbishop and ourselves. Wellesley\r\n(Dean of Windsor) prolonged it a full hour, and Bertie acquitted himself\r\n_extremely well_. To-day we take the sacrament with him.\" In a\r\nMemorandum by Her Majesty, it is said that the Prince Consort \"had a\r\nvery strong feeling about the solemnity of this act, and did not like to\r\nappear in company either the evening before or on the day on which he\r\ntook the sacrament; and he and the Queen almost always dined alone on\r\nthese occasions.\" With such habitual feelings about the solemnity of the\r\nservice, the \"First Communion\" of his eldest son must have deeply\r\ntouched his heart.\r\n\r\nIn the letter to Stockmar the Prince continues his statement about the\r\neducational plans for his son. \"Next week he is to make a run for\r\nfourteen days to the South of Ireland, with Mr. Gibbs, Captain de Ros,\r\nand Dr. Minter, for recreation. When he returns to London he is to take\r\nup his residence at the White Lodge, in Richmond Park, so as to be away\r\nfrom the world, and devote himself exclusively to study, and prepare for\r\na military examination. As companions for him we have appointed three\r\nvery distinguished young men, of from 23 to 26 years of age, who are to\r\noccupy in monthly rotation a kind of equerry's place about him, and from\r\nwhose more intimate intercourse I anticipate no small benefit to\r\nBertie.\" These companions were Lord Valletort, eldest son of Lord\r\nMount-Edgecombe, Major Teesdale, R.A., of Kars celebrity, and Major\r\nLoyd-Lindsay, V.C., of all of whom the Prince expresses to Stockmar his\r\nhigh opinion. \"Besides these three, only Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Tarver will\r\ngo with him to Richmond. As future Governor I have as yet been able to\r\nthink of no one as likely to suit, except Colonel Bruce, Lord Elgin's\r\nbrother, and his military secretary in Canada, who now commands one of\r\nthe battalions of Grenadier Guards. He has all the amiability of his\r\nsister (Lady Augusta Bruce, afterwards Lady Augusta Stanley), with great\r\nmildness of expression, and is full of ability.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Prince, the wish to obtain the services of Colonel\r\nBruce was successful. On the 9th of November, 1858, writing from Windsor\r\nCastle to the King of Prussia on political affairs, which in Prussia\r\nwere then in troubled condition, the Prince adds: \"I ought not to tease\r\nyou just now with family trifles, still I will let you know that Bertie,\r\nwho to-day solemnizes his eighteenth birthday, proposes to pay a\r\nfortnight's visit to his sister, and asks leave to present himself to\r\nyou. It will not be a State, but purely a family visit; and we,\r\ntherefore, beg you only to show him such slender courtesies as are\r\nsuitable to a member, and a very young one, of the family. To-day he\r\nbecomes a Colonel in the Army, unattached, and will receive the Garter.\r\nColonel Bruce, Lord Elgin's brother, has become his Governor.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince speaks of family events as trifles, compared with great\r\npolitical affairs, but he felt deeply every change in the home life. A\r\nfew weeks earlier, he had taken his son, Alfred, to his ship at\r\nSpithead, from which he went to sea at once. On the day before, the\r\nfather wrote, \"His departure will be another great trial to us: the\r\nsecond child lost to our family circle in one year.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of January, 1859, the Prince of Wales started on his Italian\r\ntour. He had previously been hard at study. He had opportunities of\r\nseeing much that was interesting in his continental journey, but the\r\nstay at Rome, which was greatly enjoyed, had to be abruptly ended. The\r\nrestless ambition of the Emperor of the French had brought about war\r\nwith Austria, and a French descent on Sardinia. Orders were sent to the\r\nPrince of Wales to leave Rome and repair to Gibraltar, which he reached\r\non the 7th of May. The plan now arranged was that he was to visit the\r\nsouth of Spain and Lisbon, to return to England in the middle of June,\r\nand in July and August to take up his head-quarters in Edinburgh for\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nAll this was well carried out, and on the 11th of September the Prince\r\njoined his parents at Balmoral. The Court had left Osborne on the 29th\r\nof August for the Highlands, and reached Balmoral on the 31st, after\r\nspending a day and a night in Edinburgh. Writing to Stockmar a few days\r\nafter, the Prince Consort says they had \"travelled for the first time by\r\nnight, straight through from London to Edinburgh, in order to gain a day\r\nfor that place. The experiment proved a complete success, and the Queen\r\nwas not at all tired. When in Edinburgh I had an educational conference\r\nwith all the persons who are taking part in the education of the Prince\r\nof Wales. They all speak highly of him, and he seems to have shown zeal\r\nand good will. Dr. Lyon Playfair is giving him lectures on Chemistry in\r\nrelation to Manufactures, and at the close of each special course he\r\nvisits the appropriate manufactory with him, so as to explain its\r\npractical application. Dr. Schmitz, the Rector of the High School of\r\nEdinburgh, a German, gives him lectures on Roman History. Italian,\r\nGerman, and French are advanced at the same time; and three times a week\r\nthe Prince exercises with the 16th Hussars, who are stationed near the\r\ncity. Mr. Fisher, who is to be tutor at Oxford, was also in Holyrood.\r\nLaw and History are to be the subjects on which he is to prepare the\r\nPrince.\"\r\n\r\nAll this shows the care taken in regard to the education of the Prince.\r\nThe Royal pupil had rather a stiff course of study in these days, but he\r\nstuck manfully to all his work, which had been carefully planned by his\r\ngood father, who held that little relaxation should be allowed even\r\nduring holiday time. In a letter of 17th September, 1859, to Mr. Tarver,\r\nwho was still Director of Studies, he wrote, \"I should be very sorry\r\nthat he\" (the Prince of Wales) \"should look upon the reading of a novel,\r\neven by Sir Walter Scott, _as a day's work_.\" Fond as he was himself of\r\nhigh-class works of fiction, the Prince held they should be sparingly\r\nlaid open to young people during years which should be devoted to\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nIn December 1859 the Prince Consort wrote to the old Duchess of Coburg,\r\nwho ever retained lively interest in all the family affairs, \"The visit\r\nof Prince Frederick William of Prussia and his Princess came to a close\r\non the 3rd. He has delighted us much. Vicky has developed greatly of\r\nlate, and yet remained quite a child,--of such is the Kingdom of\r\nHeaven.\" With sad interest we recall this, after recent events. Also it\r\nis written about the same time, \"The Prince of Wales is working hard at\r\nOxford.\"\r\n\r\nThe year closed, and the new year dawned very peaceably and happily, the\r\nQueen saying in her Diary, \"I never remember spending a pleasanter New\r\nYear's Day, surrounded by our children and dear Mama. It is really\r\nextraordinary how much our good children did for the day, in reading,\r\nreciting, and music.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early spring arrangements were being made for the proposed visit\r\nof the Prince of Wales to America. A promise of this visit had been\r\ngiven to the Canadians during the Crimean War for which Her Majesty's\r\nloyal subjects in the Dominion had levied and equipped a regiment. A\r\nrequest was then made that Her Majesty would visit her American\r\npossessions. On this being pronounced inexpedient, the Canadians asked\r\nthat one of the Queen's sons might be Governor-General. Their youth made\r\nthis impossible, and then the promise was made that the Prince of Wales,\r\nas soon as he was old enough, should visit Canada. It was now announced\r\nthat this visit should be early in the autumn of 1860, and that it\r\nshould be signalised by laying the foundation stone of the new Canadian\r\nParliament House at Ottawa. It was also arranged that the Prince should\r\nbe accompanied by the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary Of State for the\r\nColonies.\r\n\r\nThis no sooner became known on the other side of the water than the\r\nPresident of the United States, James Buchanan, addressed a letter to\r\nthe Queen, dated on June 4th (Independence Day), offering a cordial\r\nwelcome to the States, and assuring Her Majesty that the Prince would be\r\neverywhere greeted in a manner that could not fail to be gratifying to\r\nthe Queen. A reply was sent, in the same friendly spirit, informing the\r\nPresident that the Prince would return from Canada through the United\r\nStates, and that it would give him pleasure to have an opportunity of\r\ntestifying in person to the President that the feelings which prompted\r\nhis invitation were fully reciprocated on this side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAfter a short visit to Coburg in the early summer, the Prince started\r\nfor the New World on the 10th of July, and on the 25th landed at St.\r\nJohn's, Newfoundland. His arrival caused a fever of excitement. \"If all\r\nthe Colonies feel towards the Prince as Newfoundland does,\" wrote one\r\nwho witnessed the scenes, \"it was a most politic step to have sent him\r\non this tour.\" The rough fishermen and their wives were delighted, and\r\nwere full of admiration. \"God bless his pretty face, and send him a good\r\nwife!\" was their most frequent exclamation. The manner of the Prince to\r\nthe venerable Bishop of Newfoundland was \"very beautiful, so gentle, and\r\nquite reverential,\" that all were touched, and the old man said, \"God\r\nbless my dear young Prince! I hope he will carry away a favourable\r\nimpression of this almost unknown rugged island.\"\r\n\r\nThe same enthusiasm was shown everywhere in Canada, and the Duke of\r\nNewcastle writing to the Queen on the 23rd of September, from Dwight in\r\nIllinois, after he had crossed into the United States, thus summed up\r\nthe results of the visit: \"Now that the Canadian visit is concluded, the\r\nDuke of Newcastle may pronounce it eminently successful, and may venture\r\nto offer Her Majesty his humble but very hearty congratulations. He does\r\nnot doubt that future years will clearly demonstrate the good that has\r\nbeen done. The attachment to the Crown has been greatly cemented.... The\r\nDuke of Newcastle is rejoiced to think that this is not the only good\r\nthat has sprung out of this visit. It has done much good to the Prince\r\nof Wales himself, and the development of his mind and habit of thought\r\nis very perceptible. The Duke of Newcastle will be much disappointed if\r\nyour Majesty and the Prince Consort are not pleased with the change that\r\nhas been brought about by this practical school, in which so many of the\r\nfuture duties of life have been forced upon the Prince's daily\r\nattention. He has certainly left a very favourable impression behind\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nBesides laying the foundation stone of the buildings for the Parliament\r\nHouse at Ottawa, the Prince performed another memorable action in\r\ndriving home the last rivet of the magnificent Victoria Bridge at\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm caused by the visit to the States was immense. Chicago\r\nwas the first great town reached after leaving Niagara, and here the\r\nreception was remarkable. It was the same at Cincinnati, and at St.\r\nLouis. In fact everywhere the friendly spirit of the people was the\r\nsame, and the courtesy of the civic authorities, and of the educated\r\nclasses, most marked. A pleasant record of the prevailing feeling is\r\ngiven in a letter from a well-known American author. \"The Prince is\r\ndecidedly a popular character with us, and he may consider himself a\r\nlucky lad if he escapes nomination for President before he reaches his\r\nhome-bound fleet. The funny part of the whole affair is to note the\r\nunwillingness of people to be _shabbed_ off with a sham title (Baron\r\nRenfrew, under which name he travelled in the States), instead of His\r\nRoyal Highness the Prince of Wales, a real up and down and out and out\r\nPrince, and of the right stuff too; coupled with a hope he may long\r\nremain so; for there is not a living being more sincerely beloved by our\r\npeople than his Royal mother.\"\r\n\r\nWashington was reached on the 3rd of October. The most memorable\r\nincident of his stay at the capital was an excursion, on the 5th, in\r\ncompany with the President to Mount Vernon, the home and the\r\nburial-place of George Washington. The reporter of the Times thus speaks\r\nof the event, \"Before this humble tomb the Prince, the President, and\r\nall the party stood uncovered. It is easy moralizing on this visit, for\r\nthere is something grandly suggestive of historical retribution in the\r\nreverential awe of the Prince of Wales, the great-grandson of George\r\nIII., standing bare-headed at the foot of the coffin of Washington. For\r\na few moments the party stood mute and motionless, and the Prince then\r\nproceeded to plant a chestnut by the side of the tomb. It seemed when\r\nthe Royal youth closed in the earth around the little germ, that he was\r\nburying the last faint trace of discord between us and our great\r\nbrethren in the West.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince left Washington for Richmond on the following day, and closed\r\nhis American tour at Boston, after having had a magnificent welcome at\r\nNew York from the vast population of that city. In an American paper of\r\nthe day it was said, \"All our reminiscences, the history, the poetry,\r\nthe romance of England for ten centuries, are concentrated in the\r\nhuzzahs with which we greet the Prince of Wales.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince landed at Plymouth on the 13th of November and the same\r\nevening arrived at Windsor. On the 18th of January he went to Cambridge\r\nfor his first term, and resumed his studies, under his preceptors, at\r\nMadingley Hall. At the end of his second term he went to the camp of the\r\nCurragh of Kildare during the summer vacation.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1861 he went to Germany, with the intention of meeting\r\nthe Princess Alexandra of Denmark, with the view to marriage, if the\r\nmeeting should result in mutual attachment. The meeting, which took\r\nplace at Speier and at Heidelberg, led to their engagement. The Prince\r\nreturned to Madingley Hall, from whence he was summoned to Windsor on\r\nthe day before his beloved father's death, on the 14th of December,\r\n1861.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to encroach further on the office of the future\r\nbiographer of the Prince of Wales. In the 'Life of the Prince Consort'\r\nthe sad incidents of that December are described with touching pathos.\r\nNeither do we propose to narrate the events that occurred between the\r\ndeath of the Prince Consort and the marriage of the Prince of Wales, to\r\nthe Princess Alexandra, on the 10th of March, 1863. These events are\r\nfresh in the recollection of many to whom the incidents of the earlier\r\nlife of the Prince are less known. It is enough to say as to these\r\nyears, that he continued to be diligent in the acquirement of varied\r\nknowledge; that he carefully attended to his military duties; that he\r\ntook active part in the volunteer movement; and in town and country was\r\nalike popular, from his love of manly sport as well as of the pursuits\r\nof art.\r\n\r\nThe coming of age of the Prince was not celebrated with great ceremony,\r\nfor he was abroad at the time, and the shadow of sorrow was still over\r\nthe Royal household. But when the Prince brought his bride to England\r\nthe joy of the nation was unbounded. The passage of the Prince and\r\nPrincess through the streets of London was a scene of popular\r\nenthusiasm such as has seldom been witnessed, so tumultuous was the\r\noutburst of joy. The magnificent splendour of the marriage itself was as\r\nnothing compared with that national demonstration. In the following\r\npages it will be seen how the Prince and Princess were one in public\r\nlife, as they were in heart and home.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince and Princess were returning from Osborne, where they\r\nspent the honeymoon, on arriving at Portsmouth, _en route_ to Windsor,\r\nthe Mayor and Corporation presented an address, upon the deck of the\r\nRoyal yacht _Fairy_. This was the first of a succession of \"addresses,\"\r\nwhich were merely marriage congratulations, couched in complimentary\r\nstrains, and responded to in a few grateful and gracious words. These\r\naddresses were so numerous that they came to be merely mentioned in\r\nlist, and in that early time might have been troublesome, but for the\r\ncourtesy and good nature of the Prince. These demonstrations continued\r\nthroughout the summer, the last being at Edinburgh, where their Royal\r\nHighnesses remained for a night on the way to Abergeldie, their Highland\r\nhome near Balmoral. They did not go to Holyrood Palace, but to Douglas'\r\nprivate hotel, in St. Andrew's Square. Here a vast crowd assembled, and\r\nthe Prince and Princess had to appear and bow their acknowledgments from\r\nthe open window, till the multitude dispersed. But before going to the\r\nNorth, the Prince had already made public appearances, and his voice had\r\nbeen heard, in the City of London. The words were few, but the occasions\r\nwere so important that with them may be commenced the record of the\r\nSpeeches of His Royal Highness. The earliest appearance in a public\r\nassembly was at the banquet of the Royal Academy of Arts, on the 2nd of\r\nMay, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECHES OF H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE ROYAL ACADEMY BANQUET.\r\n\r\n_May 2nd, 1863._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual banquet given by the President and Council of the\r\nRoyal Academy of Arts, at Burlington House, is one of the chief\r\nevents of the London season, or rather, it marks the opening of the\r\nseason. It always takes place on the Saturday preceding the\r\nfirst Monday in May, when the Exhibition of Pictures is opened\r\nto the public. Seldom can a more distinguished company of men,\r\neminent in art, science, and literature, as well as in social position\r\nand public life, be seen together than on these occasions. The\r\nPrince of Wales has been a very frequent guest, and his speeches\r\nhave been so numerous, that it seems best to group them together,\r\nat a later part of this volume. But the first speech at the Academy\r\nbanquet was so interesting an occasion that it is given under the\r\ndate of its delivery.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the young Prince, and so soon after his\r\nmarriage, gave unusual _éclat_ to the banquet of 1863. At that\r\ntime Sir Charles Eastlake was President, and the rooms of the\r\nAcademy were at Trafalgar Square. After the toast of \"The Queen,\"\r\nthe President made touching reference to the loss which the\r\nnation as well as the Royal Family had recently sustained. He\r\ngave \"The memory of the great and good Prince Consort,\" which\r\nwas drunk in deep silence. Then followed the toast of \"The Prince\r\nof Wales, and the rest of the Royal Family.\" \"The Council of the\r\nRoyal Academy,\" said the President, \"had that day the honour of\r\noffering their respectful and heartfelt congratulations to His Royal\r\nHighness on his marriage to a Princess, whose personal attractions\r\nand gracious manners enhance the impression of Her Royal\r\nHighness's amiable character.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in replying, spoke (as was said at the time)\r\n\"evidently under deep emotion, but in a peculiarly clear and\r\npleasing tone of voice, and with great impressiveness of\r\nmanner\":--\r\n\r\n   \"Sir Charles Eastlake, your Royal Highnesses, my Lords, and\r\n   Gentlemen,--It is with the most contending feelings of pleasure,\r\n   pride, and sorrow that I rise to return you thanks in the name of\r\n   myself and the Royal family for the kind terms in which you, Sir\r\n   Charles, have proposed our health, and for the very cordial way\r\n   in which this distinguished assembly has received it. I cannot on\r\n   this occasion divest my mind of the associations connected with\r\n   my beloved and lamented father. His bright example cannot fail to\r\n   stimulate my efforts to tread in his footsteps: and, whatever my\r\n   shortcomings may be, I may at least presume to participate in the\r\n   interest which he took in every institution which tended to\r\n   encourage art and science in this country, but more especially in\r\n   the prosperity of the Royal Academy. Adverting to my marriage, I\r\n   beg you to believe how grateful I feel for, and I may be\r\n   permitted to add how sincerely I appreciate, the sentiments you\r\n   have expressed with reference to the Princess. I know that I am\r\n   only speaking her mind in joining her thoughts to mine on this\r\n   occasion. We neither of us can ever forget the manner in which\r\n   our union has been celebrated throughout the nation; and I should\r\n   be more than ungrateful if I did not retain the most lasting as\r\n   well as most pleasing recollection of the kind expressions and\r\n   reception which my attendance at your anniversary meeting has\r\n   evoked this evening.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the speakers at this banquet of 1863 were Lord Palmerston,\r\nMr. Thackeray, and Sir Roderick Murchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF THE CITY OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n_June 8th, 1863._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first event of importance in the public life of the Prince of Wales,\r\nafter his marriage, was the taking up the freedom of the City of London,\r\non the 8th of June, 1863. As far back as the 12th of March the following\r\nresolution had been passed by the Court of Common Council:--\r\n\r\n\"That His Royal Highness Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, be very\r\nrespectfully requested to take upon himself the freedom of the City, to\r\nwhich he is entitled by patrimony; and that upon his acceding to this\r\nrequest His Royal Highness be presented with the copy of the freedom,\r\nenclosed in a casket, in testimony of the affection and profound respect\r\nentertained by the Court for his person and character.\"\r\n\r\nHaving signified his assent to the request, the 8th of June was fixed as\r\nthe day when the Prince would come to Guildhall to take up the freedom.\r\nThe Lord Mayor and the civic authorities thought that this would be the\r\nfittest time for the official reception of the Prince and Princess, and\r\nfor an entertainment, worthy of the occasion of the marriage, and of the\r\nancient hospitality of the City of London. Invitations were accordingly\r\nissued to about two thousand guests to meet the Royal visitors, and the\r\nlist included all the most eminent persons in public life or in society,\r\nand the ambassadors and representatives of foreign countries. Immense\r\nand costly preparations were made, both in the decoration of the Hall,\r\nand for the reception of the guests. Shortly after 9 p.m. the sound of\r\ntrumpets announced that the Royal party had arrived. The Prince wore his\r\nmilitary uniform, and the Riband and Star of the Garter. The Princess\r\nwore a rich but simple white dress, with coronet and brooch of diamonds,\r\nthe wedding present of her husband, and the splendid necklace of\r\nbrilliants which the City of London had presented. With them came Prince\r\nAlfred, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke and Princess Mary of\r\nCambridge, and other Royal personages, followed by a numerous retinue.\r\nThe Royal party were conducted to the daïs, in front of which was a\r\ntable at which the Lord Mayor (Alderman Rose, M.P.), and the City\r\nofficials took their places, and there resolved themselves into a Court\r\nof Common Council. All wore their robes and insignia of office, the\r\nsword and mace laid on the table before the Lord Mayor. The resolution\r\npassed on the 12th of March having been read, and also the official\r\nrecord of His Royal Highness's title to the freedom, the Prince then\r\nread aloud and afterwards subscribed the following declaration:--\r\n\r\n\"I, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, do solemnly declare that I will be\r\ngood and true to our Sovereign Lady Queen Victoria; that I will be\r\nobedient to the Mayor of this City; that I will maintain the franchises\r\nand customs thereof, and will keep this City harmless, in that which in\r\nme is; that I will also keep the Queen's peace in my own person; that I\r\nwill know no gatherings nor conspiracies made against the Queen's peace,\r\nbut I will warn the Mayor thereof, or hinder it to my power; and that\r\nall these points and articles I will well and truly keep, according to\r\nthe laws and customs of this City, to my power.\r\n\r\n\"ALBERT EDWARD.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin Scott, the Chamberlain, then read an address, at the close\r\nof which he offered the right hand of fellowship as a citizen of London,\r\nand presented the gold casket containing the record of the freedom. The\r\nPrince, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Mayor, Mr. Chamberlain, and Gentlemen,--It is, I assure\r\n    you, a source of sincere gratification to me to attend here for\r\n    the purpose of being invested with a privilege which for the\r\n    reasons you have stated you are unable to confer upon me, and\r\n    which descends to me by inheritance. It is a patrimony that I am\r\n    proud to claim--this freedom of the greatest city of the\r\n    commercial world, which holds its charter from such an ancient\r\n    date. My pride is increased when I call to memory the long list\r\n    of illustrious men who have been enrolled among the citizens of\r\n    London, more especially when I connect with that list the\r\n    beloved father to whom you have adverted in such warm terms of\r\n    eulogy and respect, and through whom I am here to claim my\r\n    freedom of the City of London. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, the\r\n    Princess and myself heartily thank you for the past--for your\r\n    loyalty and expressions of attachment towards the Queen, for the\r\n    manifestations of this evening towards ourselves, and for all\r\n    your prayers for our future happiness.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremony was ended, the Prince and the Royal visitors withdrew\r\nfrom the Hall, but soon returned to join in the festivities, which began\r\nwith a ball. \"The Lord Mayor led off in a spirited quadrille with Her\r\nRoyal Highness the Princess, and the Prince with the Lady Mayoress.\" So\r\nruns the record, with details of the dances, and the names of the\r\ndancers in the area kept clear, in front of the daïs, for the special\r\nguests. Attempts were occasionally made to keep up dancing in the body\r\nof the Hall, but the crowd was so great that, till after supper, and the\r\nretirement of the Royal party, the fête was more of a grand assembly\r\nthan a ball. Under whatever name, it was a magnificent entertainment,\r\nand aged citizens tell us that Guildhall had never witnessed a scene so\r\nsplendid and joyous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH ORPHAN ASYLUM.\r\n\r\n_June 24th, 1863._\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest appearances of the Prince and Princess of Wales in\r\nsupport of a charitable institution was when they opened the new\r\nbuildings erected at Slough for the British Orphan Asylum, on the 24th\r\nof June, 1863. The scholars belonging to the Asylum had so largely\r\nincreased in number that the Board of Directors resolved in 1862 to move\r\nthe whole establishment from Clapham Rise, its former locality, to more\r\nspacious premises at Slough. They bought the freehold of the well-known\r\nand large Royal Hotel, which had been closed since the old coaches had\r\nbeen driven off the road by the railway. The situation was admirable,\r\nand the grounds spacious, and by adding an additional story the building\r\nwas readily adapted to its new purpose.\r\n\r\nThe fine weather and the presence of the Prince and Princess attracted a\r\nlarge assemblage. On the arrival of their Royal Highnesses the pupils\r\nsang the old Hundredth Psalm, the National Anthem having been previously\r\nplayed by military bands as the procession moved towards a daïs, beneath\r\na marquee on the lawn. An Address was read, concluding with the\r\nexpression of a hope that the Prince and Princess would allow their\r\nnames to be enrolled as Vice-Patron and Vice-Patroness of the Asylum, of\r\nwhich the Queen is Patron. The Prince made the following  reply:--\r\n\r\n\"It has given the Princess and myself great pleasure to be present at\r\nthe opening of your most excellent Asylum, and to have been invited to\r\ntake part in so good a work. The benevolent purposes of this\r\nwidely-extended institution speak for themselves. It is one in which the\r\nQueen and my lamented father, the promoter of every scheme for the\r\nrelief of the miserable, evinced a warm interest, and the details which\r\nyou have given of its formation and progress furnish another appeal for\r\naid from those whose highest enjoyment it is to give a home and\r\neducation to the fatherless and destitute. It is a privilege, I assure\r\nyou, that the Princess and myself value greatly to have our names\r\nassociated with the British orphan Asylum.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince then formally declared the building to be for ever dedicated\r\nto the purposes of the British orphan Asylum, and also announced the\r\nmunificent gift of £12,000 from Mr. Edward Mackenzie to the building\r\nfund. The Bishop of Bath and Wells offered prayer; a choral was sung,\r\nand many purses were presented in the offertory. Trees were also planted\r\nin commemoration of the day.\r\n\r\nEleven years later, the Prince presided at the anniversary festival of\r\nthe Asylum. He then said that he felt a special interest in the\r\ninstitution, which he had visited along with the Princess of Wales so\r\nmany years before. In his speech at that festival he spoke more fully of\r\nthe objects and merits of the Asylum, as will be seen in the report\r\nunder the date of the festival in May 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT MERCERS' HALL.\r\n\r\n_July 8th, 1863._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the visit to Guildhall, the common hall of all the City Guilds or\r\nCompanies, the civic event of most importance was when, on the 8th of\r\nJuly, 1863, the Prince went to the City to take up his freedom in the\r\nMercers' Company, and to enroll his name on their records.\r\n\r\nIt was a fitting thing thus early to show his attachment to ancient\r\nGuilds and Corporate Constitutions. The Mercers' Company is the first in\r\nrank, and the most ancient of all the great City Guilds, and its roll of\r\nmembers is one of the most illustrious. Its existence as a Metropolitan\r\nGuild can be traced as far back as the year 1172, and the Company\r\nreceived its incorporation in 1392 from Richard II., who conferred upon\r\nit the honour of becoming one of its brethren. Besides the Royal names\r\nof King Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth, the Company can boast those of\r\nSir Richard Whittington, William Caxton the Printer, Sir Thomas Gresham,\r\nand Dean Colet, the founder of St. Paul's School. The address to the\r\nPrince was read by the Master Warden, the Rev. Markland Barnard, who had\r\nthe distinction of representing the fourteenth generation of his family,\r\nwho had been freemen or wardens of the Company ever since the third year\r\nof Henry IV.\r\n\r\nTo this address the Prince listened with marked attention, and then\r\nreplied, in a clear and pleasing tone, which those who heard it said he\r\ninherited from his Royal mother:--\r\n\r\n    \"Master and Court of Assistants,--I am glad to avail myself of\r\n    the last opportunity which my stay in London affords me of\r\n    attending here this day to receive the freedom of your ancient\r\n    and honourable company. The oldest of the city companies, the\r\n    Mercers', is hardly exceeded by any in the amount of its\r\n    charities, or in its capabilities of doing good. How these\r\n    powers have been exercised, the list of the foundations of the\r\n    company and of the distinguished persons whom you have\r\n    enumerated as benefactors and freemen tells us. Among the\r\n    latter, the great Sovereign, who was herself a sister of the\r\n    company, stands conspicuous; and commerce and science appear\r\n    equally to have lent their representatives to ennoble the\r\n    Mercers' Company. To be associated with such names in the\r\n    freedom and history of your company is an honour and privilege I\r\n    am proud to have conferred upon me. I thank you sincerely for\r\n    the terms in which you have mentioned the names of my beloved\r\n    mother and the Princess, and for the happiness you desire for us\r\n    both.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince then subscribed the Oath of the Company, with its quaint old\r\nphraseology, affixing his usual signature, ALBERT EDWARD, P.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk then presented His Royal Highness with the formal document\r\nwhich enrolled him as a Freeman, enclosed in a massive gold casket of\r\nexquisite design and workmanship. The numerous visitors who had\r\nwitnessed the ceremony afterwards had a _déjeuner_ in the Banqueting\r\nHall, the Prince with a small number of select guests being at the same\r\ntime entertained in the Council Room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL LITERARY FUND.\r\n\r\n_May 18th, 1864._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last annual Report of the Royal Literary Fund, for 1888, it is\r\nsaid: \"The anniversary of 1864 was memorable as the first public dinner\r\npresided over by the Prince of Wales, to whose presence in the chair the\r\nInstitution is indebted for a success altogether unprecedented in the\r\nhistory of its anniversaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe annual Report for 1864 contains a detailed account of the\r\nproceedings at that meeting, the seventy-fifth anniversary of the\r\nInstitution. It was natural that a large number of eminent men should\r\nassemble to support the youthful Chairman, whose illustrious father had\r\npresided at the fifty-third anniversary, in 1842. In the long list of\r\nStewards, in 1864, appear the names of almost all those most\r\ndistinguished at that time, not only in Literature, but in Art and\r\nScience, and in every department of the public service. Upwards of four\r\nhundred attended, and the special donations to the fund at the dinner\r\namounted to £2328 17_s._, a sum then far in advance of any profit of\r\nformer anniversaries. This amount has only once since been exceeded,\r\nwhen the King of the Belgians presided, in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn commemoration of Prince Albert's presidency, Her Majesty was\r\ngraciously pleased to grant to this Institution the privilege of bearing\r\nthe Crown as an addition to its Armorial bearings, and the style of the\r\nInstitution was thenceforth that of \"The Royal Literary Fund.\" Her\r\nMajesty confers upon it the sanction of her name as its Patron, and has\r\nshown her interest by an annual benefaction of One Hundred Guineas, ever\r\nsince the year of her Accession.\r\n\r\nBy the donations and subscriptions of members of the Corporation, with\r\nthe addition of legacies, and the profits obtained at the anniversary\r\nfestivals, the Royal Literary Fund has been enabled, since its\r\nfoundation in the latter part of the eighteenth century, to dispense\r\nupwards of £105,000 to needy persons of the literary class.\r\n\r\nThe importance and the benefits of the Institution will more clearly\r\nappear from a brief statement of the proceedings at the Festival over\r\nwhich H.R.H. the Prince of Wales presided. The dinner was served in St.\r\nJames's Hall on Wednesday, May 18th. Grace was said by the Lord Primate\r\nof Ireland. After the removal of the cloth, and the singing of the \"Deum\r\nLaudate,\" the Prince rose to propose the first toast:--\r\n\r\n    \"The first toast I have the honour to propose is 'The health of\r\n    Her Majesty the Queen, our munificent Patron;' a toast which I\r\n    feel sure will be drunk with the enthusiasm which it elicits on\r\n    all public occasions. Although the Queen is now compelled, to a\r\n    certain extent, to withdraw from public life, still her interest\r\n    in every institution of this country, and particularly in\r\n    charitable institutions, remains undiminished. Gentlemen, I give\r\n    you 'The Queen.'\"\r\n\r\nThe next toast was proposed by the Marquis of Salisbury, \"The health of\r\nHer Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, and the rest of the Royal\r\nFamily.\" The toast was drunk with all the honours and responded to by\r\nHis Royal Highness the Chairman. \"The Church\" having been proposed by\r\nthe Rt. Hon. Edward Cardwell, and responded to by the Archbishop of\r\nArmagh, H.R.H. the Chairman proposed the toast of \"The Army, Navy, and\r\nVolunteers,\" saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"This is a toast which it gives me especial pleasure to propose\r\n    from the circumstance of my having served for a time with both\r\n    infantry and cavalry. Short as my service was, it has been long\r\n    enough to impress me with the conviction of the efficiency of\r\n    all ranks composing the British army. I have also had an\r\n    opportunity during my voyage to America in 1860, and on many\r\n    other occasions, of witnessing the able manner in which the\r\n    duties of the navy are performed. The volunteers demand our\r\n    warmest thanks and approbation for the zeal with which they came\r\n    forward when they thought their services were required, a zeal\r\n    which they still evince on every occasion afforded to them. I\r\n    beg to couple with 'the Army and Volunteers,' the name of my\r\n    illustrious relative the Duke of Cambridge, who so ably fills\r\n    the arduous post of Commander-in-Chief entrusted to him by the\r\n    Queen, and to whose practical and liberal administration the\r\n    army owes its present high state of efficiency. With 'the Navy,'\r\n    I will couple the name of Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Milne, who\r\n    has only lately returned from the successful discharge of the\r\n    difficult duties attaching to the command of the North American\r\n    Station. Gentlemen, let us drink to the 'Army, Navy, and\r\n    Volunteers.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge and Admiral Sir Alexander Milne having responded,\r\nHis Royal Highness the Chairman then gave the toast of \"The Royal\r\nLiterary Fund,\" saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highness, my Lords, and Gentlemen, I have now the\r\n    honour to propose the most important toast of the evening, it is\r\n    'Prosperity to the Royal Literary Fund.' Although the most\r\n    important, it is nevertheless the toast upon which, perhaps, I\r\n    can say least, certainly I can give you no new information, as\r\n    every one here present knows better than I do the character of\r\n    this institution. Still it is right that I should offer a few\r\n    remarks on the working of this Society. You are all aware,\r\n    gentlemen, of the immense advantages which have been derived\r\n    from it in support of literature and science. One of its\r\n    principal features is that it is not limited to our own\r\n    countrymen, but is often extended to literary men of all\r\n    nations; so that we may feel proud to think that by our timely\r\n    assistance, we not only advance the literature of our own\r\n    country, but that of other nations. In this way, many eminent\r\n    men who would otherwise be incapacitated from carrying on their\r\n    labours, and from making their talents known to the world, are\r\n    enabled to do so. The second important feature is the secrecy\r\n    with which this timely aid is given,--a secrecy so sacredly\r\n    observed that in the whole number of cases, which amount to\r\n    1,645 since the foundation of this Corporation in the year 1790,\r\n    there is not a single case of any indiscretion having been\r\n    committed; and if cases have been brought to light at all, it\r\n    has only been through the acknowledgment of the literary men\r\n    thus assisted, who have been anxious to express their gratitude.\r\n    I ought here to mention the name of an eminent man of letters,\r\n    whose loss must be deeply deplored in all literary circles. I\r\n    allude to Mr. Thackeray. I allude to him, not so much on account\r\n    of his works, for they are standard works, but because he was\r\n    an active member of your committee, and always ready to open\r\n    his purse for the relief of literary men struggling with\r\n    difficulties.\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen, some of those here present do not perhaps know that\r\n    in France, since 1857, an Institution similar to ours, and\r\n    founded by M. Thenard, has been in existence for the benefit of\r\n    scientific men only, and that a few days ago M. Champfleury, a\r\n    distinguished writer, proposed to form a Literary Society\r\n    adopting some of our principles. It is to be hoped that some day\r\n    these two societies may form sister Literary Funds; and if\r\n    administered on our model, I think we may augur for the new\r\n    institution a large measure of success. We shall at all times be\r\n    most happy to enter into communication with it, and show it the\r\n    result of our long experience and of the unwearied zeal and\r\n    exertion of the Officers of this Corporation.\r\n\r\n    \"I will not detain you much longer, gentlemen, but I cannot sit\r\n    down without bringing back to your recollection the deep\r\n    interest which my dear and lamented father took in everything\r\n    connected with literature and science, and particularly in the\r\n    labours of this Society. Nobody has forgotten that the second\r\n    time he spoke in public in this country, was as chairman of the\r\n    Literary Fund dinner. And we all, I am convinced, deeply regret\r\n    that the speeches made on that occasion were not reported at\r\n    full length, as every word falling from those lips could not\r\n    fail to command universal admiration. Gentlemen, let us drink\r\n    'Prosperity to the Royal Literary Fund.'\"\r\n\r\nThe list of subscriptions and donations having been read, including a\r\ndonation of £110 from the Prince of Wales, Earl Stanhope, as President\r\nof the Institution, responded. Speeches being delivered by Earl Russell,\r\nMr. Anthony Trollope, Lord Houghton, and H. E. M. Van de Weyer, Earl\r\nStanhope proposed the health of the Chairman, which was received with\r\nmuch enthusiasm, and the Prince thus replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highness, my Lords and Gentlemen, I thank you most\r\n    sincerely for the kind and cordial manner in which you have\r\n    drunk my health, and I feel proud to have occupied the chair for\r\n    the first time, on so interesting and important an occasion. I\r\n    must now take the opportunity to congratulate this Corporation\r\n    on the great advantage which it enjoys, in the services of the\r\n    distinguished nobleman who now fills the high office of your\r\n    President, and who has contributed so much to historical\r\n    literature. I can give him no higher praise, than by saying that\r\n    he is a worthy successor of a nobleman who was for more than\r\n    twenty years your president; who throughout a long political\r\n    career never made an enemy, and who always found time to assist\r\n    in the advancement of literature and art. I allude to the late\r\n    Marquess of Lansdowne. Gentlemen, allow me to propose one more\r\n    toast. In the presence of a Society, accustomed to cultivate\r\n    with such signal success the flowers of literature, it would be\r\n    unpardonable to forget the flowers of society. I propose the\r\n    health of 'The Ladies,' who, by their numerous attendance here\r\n    this evening, evince the interest they take in the Literary\r\n    Fund.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was received with the usual honours. It should have been\r\nmentioned that nearly 400 ladies were present, but in the galleries, not\r\nat the tables as guests, as is the better custom at some anniversaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION OF 1865.\r\n\r\n_May 9th, 1865._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Dublin has seldom presented a scene of more general joy than\r\nwhen the Prince of Wales opened the International Exhibition, on the 9th\r\nof May, 1865. The weather was superb, the loyal demonstrations in the\r\nstreets were enthusiastic, and the great Hall where the opening ceremony\r\ntook place, decorated with the flag of all nations, was densely crowded\r\nwith the most distinguished assembly that Ireland could bring to welcome\r\nthe heir of the throne, and the representative of the Queen. There were\r\nno disloyal feelings nor discordant sounds in the Palace that day. The\r\nDuke of Leinster, the Earl of Rosse, and the highest and most\r\ndistinguished of the nobles of Ireland were there. The Lord Mayor and\r\nCorporation of the City appeared in their civic robes. The Mayors of\r\nCork and Waterford and Londonderry walked together; and the Lord Mayors\r\nof London and York, and the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, with many\r\nofficial personages, joined in the procession. When His Royal Highness\r\ntook his place in the chair of State, the orchestra, 1000 strong,\r\nperformed the National Anthem, and 10,000 voices sent up their loyal\r\ncheers at its conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Leinster read the address of the Committee, to which the\r\nPrince replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--I thank you for your address. It is a\r\n    source of sincere pleasure to me to discharge the duties\r\n    confided to me by Her Majesty the Queen in thus inaugurating\r\n    your Exhibition. It is not less in accordance with my own\r\n    feelings than with those of Her Majesty to assist in every\r\n    measure calculated for the happiness and welfare of the Irish\r\n    people. The example of my lamented and beloved parent will, I\r\n    trust, ever be present to my mind as a stimulus in the\r\n    encouragement of every work tending to advance international\r\n    prosperity, and to develope the powers and resources of our own\r\n    country. The cultivation of the fine arts, in itself so powerful\r\n    an auxiliary in the civilization and refinement of the human\r\n    race, has been an important object in these Exhibitions, and\r\n    seems already to have produced most satisfactory results.\r\n    Believe me very sensible of your kind wishes on behalf of the\r\n    Princess of Wales. Her regret at being unable to accompany me\r\n    equals my own, and you may rely upon her anxiety to come among\r\n    you, assured of the welcome she will receive.\"\r\n\r\nThen from the grand organ and choir rose the ever impressive music of\r\nthe Hundredth Psalm, the most Catholic of all strains of praise and\r\nthanksgiving. At its close there was another address, giving an account\r\nof the origin and history of the Exhibition. A copy of the Catalogue,\r\nand the key of the building, having been presented to the Prince, the\r\norgan and orchestra pealed forth Handel's Coronation Anthem. Then came\r\nanother address, presented by the Lord Mayor and the Corporation of\r\nDublin, in their civic robes. This was read and handed to His Royal\r\nHighness, who thus replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the City of\r\n    Dublin,--I return you my hearty thanks for the kind welcome you\r\n    have given me, and for your loyal expressions towards Her\r\n    Majesty the Queen. I regret that circumstances should prevent\r\n    the extension of my visit to a longer period. It would have been\r\n    very gratifying to the Princess had she been able to accompany\r\n    me, and I request that you be assured that we look forward to\r\n    another occasion when she will have the opportunity of\r\n    appreciating the hearty welcome which my own experience leads me\r\n    to anticipate for her. You justly ascribe to me a peculiar\r\n    interest in this day's ceremony. As the son of that revered and\r\n    lamented parent to whose wisdom, energy, and influence you truly\r\n    state exhibitions such as these owe their origin, I may well\r\n    feel proud in being able to assist in the inauguration of the\r\n    one we are about to open. May your prayers be granted that it\r\n    will be the means of producing the usual result attending\r\n    well-directed labour, and conduce to the prosperity of Ireland\r\n    and to the happiness of her people.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed more music, from Haydn's Creation, and the State\r\nprocession moved from the centre of the nave, and made a tour of the\r\nExhibition. The Committee had arranged that music should form a notable\r\nfeature of the ceremonies, for when the Prince returned to the daïs, the\r\norchestra gave with grand effect Mendelssohn's 'Hymn of Praise.' At its\r\nconclusion the Prince rose and commanded Sir Bernard Burke, Ulster\r\nKing-at-Arms, to declare the Exhibition open. This was done amidst a\r\nflourish of trumpets, and on a rocket being sent up as a signal, salvos\r\nof artillery were fired from the forts and batteries, and from the ships\r\nof war off Kingstown.\r\n\r\nSuch was the opening ceremony. In the evening the Lord Mayor gave a ball\r\nat the Mansion House. The city was brilliantly illuminated. Next day\r\nthere was a review in the Phoenix Park, the number of spectators on\r\nthe ground being greater than on any occasion since the visit of the\r\nQueen in 1849. The Prince of Wales, who wore the uniform of the 10th\r\nHussars, of which regiment he is Colonel, was received with the utmost\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThis was the first State visit of the Prince of Wales to Ireland. His\r\nsecond visit, along with the Princess of Wales, was a time of even\r\ngreater brilliancy, and evoked equal enthusiasm of loyalty. If later\r\nvisits were marked with less unanimity of rejoicing, the causes of the\r\napparent disloyalty are well understood, and the disaffection is known\r\nto be partial and temporary. Nothing has ever occurred to lessen the\r\npersonal popularity of the Prince of Wales, nor to give reasonable cause\r\nfor the reception of any of the Royal Family being less cordial and\r\nenthusiastic than that of the Prince in 1865. The Exhibition of that\r\nyear was held under the patronage of the Queen, who wished every success\r\nto the \"patriotic undertaking,\" as she called it. They can be no true\r\npatriots who seek to lessen the Queen's interest in the welfare of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL REFORMATORY EXHIBITION, HELD IN THE AGRICULTURAL HALL,\r\nISLINGTON.\r\n\r\n_May 19th, 1865._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the great national and international Exhibitions, in which were\r\nseen the most advanced displays of art, fostered by wealth, skill, and\r\ntraining, it is pleasant to look back upon other exhibitions, of a\r\nhumbler but not less useful kind, which were encouraged and patronized\r\nby the Prince of Wales. One of the most memorable of these, the pattern\r\nand parent of many local exhibitions of similar kind, was the\r\nReformatory Exhibition held in the Agricultural Hall, Islington, in\r\n1865. It was to exhibit the productions of various schools connected\r\nwith the Reformatory and Refuge Union. The articles were the veritable\r\nmanufacture of poor boys and girls of the lowest classes, many of them\r\nutterly destitute and hopeless as to any usefulness in life, until\r\nrescued and taught various industries, by the efforts of Christian and\r\nphilanthropic men.\r\n\r\nThe good and venerated Lord Shaftesbury was the President of the Union,\r\nof which the Prince of Wales had gladly allowed himself to be named\r\nPatron. In an address read by Lord Shaftesbury, it was stated that the\r\nobjects exhibited were contributed by workers in above two hundred\r\nseparate institutions in London and other great towns. An invitation had\r\nbeen sent out for contributions from foreign schools of the same class,\r\nand this was responded to by articles being sent from almost every part\r\nof Europe, and some from Africa and America. Hence the title of\r\ninternational could be fairly given to the show. The representatives of\r\nseveral foreign governments were present on the occasion. The opening of\r\nthe meeting by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the sacred choral music\r\nperformed by about one thousand children from the Reformatory and Refuge\r\nSchools, showed that moral and religious training was associated with\r\nthe industrial work of the Union.\r\n\r\nTo the address of Lord Shaftesbury, the Prince replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Grace, your Excellencies, my Lords, Ladies and\r\n    Gentlemen,--I have gladly taken a part in the proceedings of\r\n    this day, and complied with your request that I should attend,\r\n    as patron of this society, with the greatest satisfaction. The\r\n    benevolent purpose of this Exhibition cannot fail to be followed\r\n    by deserved success, and claims the co-operation of every one\r\n    who has the interests of the industrious poor at heart, and who\r\n    desires to forward the object which the Reformatory and Refuge\r\n    Union has in view--namely, industrial and moral training. The\r\n    Committee do me justice in believing that I cordially sympathize\r\n    in the welcome this society offers to those representatives of\r\n    foreign countries who have responded to the invitation they have\r\n    received by their presence and contributions. In doing so they\r\n    have borne testimony, in common with ourselves, to the value of\r\n    these international exhibitions in promoting the growth of those\r\n    Christian and kind feelings towards each other which we ought to\r\n    pray should animate the whole of the nations of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply, read in a clear, sonorous voice, was heard in every part of\r\nthe building, and at its conclusion the cheers were loud and prolonged.\r\nPrayers were then offered up by the Archbishop of Canterbury, after\r\nwhich, and the singing of a hymn composed by the late Prince Consort,\r\nHis Royal Highness declared the Exhibition opened.\r\n\r\nThe Prince then spent considerable time in examining various parts of\r\nthe Exhibition, and delighted many youthful manufacturers by the very\r\nnumerous purchases of every description, from the girls' as well as the\r\nboys' stalls, such as lace and crochet work to take to the Princess of\r\nWales. The heartiness with which the Prince entered into the spirit of\r\nthe occasion charmed all who were present.\r\n\r\nOn an earlier day of the same year, on the 1st of March, the Prince had\r\nvisited an Exhibition got up by the South London Working Classes. No\r\nformal address or speech marked this visit, but the interest taken by\r\nthe Prince, and his liberal purchases, of which all the neighbourhood\r\nsoon heard and spoke, secured the success of the Exhibition. One\r\nexhibitor wished the Prince to accept a toy cart, which had attracted\r\nhis notice, but the Prince good-humouredly declined such irregularity,\r\nhowever kindly intended, and insisted on paying for this as for all the\r\npurchases during the visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAILORS' HOME, LONDON DOCKS.\r\n\r\n_May 22nd, 1865._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objects and the advantages of Sailors' Homes are now so universally\r\nknown, that few words are needed for introducing a brief report of the\r\nvisit of the Prince of Wales to the Home at the London Docks, on May\r\n22nd, 1865. This institution has now for above fifty years afforded\r\nprotection, comfort, and instruction to all classes of the mercantile\r\nmarine service. With increase of the trade and shipping of London, new\r\naccommodation was required; and in 1863 the foundation stone of a new\r\nwing to the Sailors' Home was laid by Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nIt was to open this completed building that the Prince of Wales made his\r\nvisit to the east of London. The event was regarded as a great honour by\r\nthe crowded and busy population of that quarter, and a general holiday\r\nwas held on the occasion. Many distinguished persons, including some of\r\nthe Foreign Ministers, were present. Foreign seamen in the British\r\nmercantile service are admitted to benefits of the Home. An address\r\nhaving been read by Admiral Sir William Bowles, President of the\r\nInstitution, the Prince replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir William Bowles, your Excellencies, my Lords, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--It is very gratifying to me to comply with the\r\n    invitation I have received to take a part in this day's\r\n    proceedings and to preside at the opening of the new wing of\r\n    this institution. The beneficial results attending the\r\n    establishment of a Sailors' Home for our immense mercantile navy\r\n    are shown by the statements and figures which you have now\r\n    given, and which establish in the most satisfactory manner the\r\n    necessity of adding to the original building. The interest taken\r\n    by my lamented father in the religious welfare of this\r\n    institution, evinced by his laying the foundation stone of the\r\n    Seamen's Church adjoining, will not, I trust, be less in his\r\n    son, who is well aware of the sentiments of loyalty and devotion\r\n    to the Throne which distinguish the mercantile navy of Great\r\n    Britain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL DRAMATIC COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n_June 5th, 1865._\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much the Prince of Wales has, from early life, favoured dramatic\r\nart, and encouraged its professors, is universally known. While enjoying\r\nthe drama for his own recreation, amidst more arduous labours, he has\r\nbeen always ready to support any well-devised and well-directed scheme\r\nfor the benefit of the dramatic profession. It was with this feeling\r\nthat he accepted the invitation to inaugurate and formally open the\r\nRoyal Dramatic College at Woking.\r\n\r\nThere was a great gathering on the occasion, and the hall was well\r\nfilled, principally by ladies, before the proceedings commenced. Mr.\r\nWebster, the Master of the College, having presented the Prince with a\r\nmassive gold key, symbolical of the ceremony, and having read an address\r\ndescribing the objects of the Institution, His Royal Highness replied as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen,--It is truly gratifying to my feelings to find\r\n    myself this day called on to take a part in the final completion\r\n    of a building the foundation of which was the work of my\r\n    lamented father, as it was also an object which he had much at\r\n    heart. My satisfaction is increased by finding his beneficent\r\n    plan carried out in a manner worthy of the cause and of the\r\n    profession for the benefit of which the Dramatic College has\r\n    been instituted, and that, as the inevitable hour approaches, he\r\n    who has so often administered to your amusement, blended with\r\n    instruction, will here find a retreat open for age and its\r\n    infirmities, in grateful recognition of a debt due by the world\r\n    at large. I am happy to learn that the funds are progressively\r\n    increasing towards conferring the inestimable boon of education\r\n    on the children of men who, whether by their performances or by\r\n    their writings, have themselves laboured so well in the cause of\r\n    literature, and so justly earned this provision for their\r\n    offspring. The inauguration of the building we are now in\r\n    completes the three purposes which you have enumerated as\r\n    forming the original design of this institution. After having\r\n    provided for the material wants and comforts of those who are\r\n    entitled to seek a shelter in this asylum, the last object is to\r\n    cheer their evening of life, and to embellish its closing scenes\r\n    with the books, memorials, and records of their art, that they\r\n    may again live in the past, and make their final exit in a\r\n    spirit of thankfulness to God and their fellow-creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHMONGERS' HALL DINNER.\r\n\r\n_June 11th, 1865._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of June, 1865, a banquet was given to the Prince of Wales by\r\nthe Fishmongers' Company in their hall at London Bridge. Two years\r\nbefore, in 1863, the name of the Prince was added to the roll of the\r\nCompany, so that on this occasion he appeared as a member as well as a\r\nguest. Allusion was made to this by the Prime Warden, James Spicer,\r\nwho, as Chairman, proposed the health of the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales, and the rest of the Royal Family. Reference was also made to the\r\nrecent birth of another infant Prince, so that there was prospect of two\r\nRoyal members, who would in due time have the right of inscribing their\r\nnames on their freemen's roll. Some of the Prime Warden's words are\r\nworth reproducing, as showing at how early an age the Prince had\r\nexhibited the traits of character, and the line of action, by which he\r\nhas now so long been distinguished. The Prime Warden said that \"he was\r\nnot using the language of flattery, but simply recording a fact with\r\nwhich the people of these realms, from one end of the kingdom to the\r\nother, were conversant, when he said that the esteem and the affection\r\nwith which His Royal Highness was regarded by Her Majesty's subjects\r\nwere owing no less to his amiable manners, his kindly disposition, and\r\nthe condescension which he invariably displayed in his intercourse with\r\nall the classes of the community, than to the exalted position which he\r\noccupied, and the relation in which he stood as heir apparent to the\r\nBritish Throne. There was another circumstance which had endeared him to\r\nthe people of England, and that was that he had followed so closely in\r\nthe footsteps of his ever-to-be-lamented and illustrious father, by\r\nlending his high sanction to the promotion of those industrial\r\nexhibitions that tended so much to elevate and improve the tastes and\r\nhabits of the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, in acknowledging the toast, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Prime Warden, your Royal Highness, my Lords, Ladies, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--I thank you very much for the kind manner in which\r\n    my name and that of the Princess of Wales, and the other members\r\n    of the Royal family, have been proposed and received. I need\r\n    hardly tell you that it is a source of sincere gratification to\r\n    me to be present here this evening; not only as a guest, but as\r\n    a member--a freeman of this corporation. I have not forgotten\r\n    that soon after I came of age the first freedom of any of the\r\n    ancient guilds of this city with which I was presented was that\r\n    of the Fishmongers' Company in 1863. I am proud also to think\r\n    that I have been thus enrolled as a member of a company into\r\n    which so many of my relations have been admitted, whose\r\n    portraits adorn these walls. Although this is a joyous occasion,\r\n    I cannot forbear alluding to the loss of one whose name is\r\n    intimately connected with the city of London, Mr. Cubitt, who\r\n    was twice elected Lord Mayor of London, and who was your Prime\r\n    Warden three years ago when I took up my freedom in this\r\n    company. I need not recall to your memory how anxious he was to\r\n    promote every kind of charity, and I feel sure you will not\r\n    think it unbecoming in me or inopportune to mention his name on\r\n    this occasion. In conclusion, I beg again to thank you for the\r\n    kind manner in which you have alluded to a recent event, and the\r\n    cordial wishes you have expressed for the speedy recovery of the\r\n    Princess. I can assure you my heartfelt wish is that my two sons\r\n    may learn to emulate and follow the bright example of their\r\n    revered grandfather.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH DAY AT WELLINGTON COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n_July 3rd, 1865._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of July 1865, the ceremony of distributing prizes at\r\nWellington College was performed by the Prince of Wales, in presence of\r\na distinguished company. The Governors of the College were in\r\nattendance, the Bishop of Oxford, the Earl of Derby, Earl Stanhope, Lord\r\nEversley, Lord Chelmsford, Mr. Walter, M.P., and Mr. Cox. At the\r\nluncheon, which followed the proceedings in the large hall of the\r\nCollege, the head master, Mr. Benson (now Archbishop of Canterbury),\r\nhaving proposed the toast of the Prince of Wales, thanking him for his\r\npresence that day, and for the kind favour and interest with which he\r\nhad uniformly regarded the institution, the Prince replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--I am deeply sensible of the manner in\r\n    which Mr. Benson has proposed my health, and in which it has\r\n    been received by the company assembled here to-day. I need\r\n    hardly assure you that it is a source of sincere gratification\r\n    to me to find myself once more within the walls of Wellington\r\n    College, taking part in the proceedings of 'Speech Day,' and\r\n    distributing prizes to the successful competitors. Allow me, Mr.\r\n    Benson, to congratulate you, and through you the whole college,\r\n    on the highly efficient state in which I find it. I feel\r\n    convinced that my young friends have not forgotten that it bears\r\n    the name of one of the greatest soldiers England ever knew. In\r\n    the success of this institution Mr. Benson has already\r\n    mentioned, and I need hardly remind you, that the Queen takes a\r\n    strong interest; a still greater interest was taken by my\r\n    father, to whose exertions the college really owes its origin. I\r\n    have now, my lords and gentlemen, a very pleasing task to\r\n    perform, and that is to make an announcement which I hope will\r\n    not be considered indiscreet on my part. At the last meeting of\r\n    the Governors of Wellington College, Lord Derby intimated that\r\n    it was his intention to devote the profits of his justly\r\n    celebrated translation of 'Homer' to the production of a prize\r\n    to be given annually as a reward to the foundationer who within\r\n    the year of his leaving the college should conduct himself to\r\n    the entire approbation of the Head Master--be considered, in\r\n    fact, the most industrious and well-conducted boy or young man\r\n    in the school. I feel certain that this announcement will be\r\n    received with great pleasure. It will show you the interest\r\n    which the noble lord takes in this institution, and will be a\r\n    stimulus to increased exertion on the part of those within its\r\n    walls. I thank you, Mr. Benson, for proposing, and you, my lords\r\n    and gentlemen, for drinking, my health so cordially; and I\r\n    assure you it affords me great gratification whenever I can do\r\n    anything to promote the welfare of Wellington College.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the proceedings states that this speech was \"delivered\r\nwith a heartiness which elicited corresponding enthusiasm in the\r\naudience.\" The other speakers were Sir John Pakington, who said he had\r\nthe most gratifying proof of the efficiency of the College in the\r\nprogress made by his son as one of the pupils; and Lord Derby, who said\r\nthat no worthier and suitable memorial of \"the Great Duke\" could have\r\nbeen erected in his honour than this institution, which was not merely a\r\nmilitary school, but a college for training young Englishmen for the\r\nUniversities, and for every department of public life, although all the\r\nfoundationers are sons of deceased officers. Lord Derby also referred to\r\nthe prize instituted by him, such rewards being usually given only to\r\nability and successful study, while his object was to hold forth a\r\nstimulus to general study, and persevering good conduct. He would not\r\nhave referred to the gift which it was his happiness to make, had not\r\nthe matter been mentioned by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Prince was again at Wellington College on the 17th of June, 1867,\r\nand he has ever since taken personal interest in the institution, as one\r\nof its Governors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS.\r\n\r\n_May 9th, 1866._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President and Council of the Institution of Civil Engineers had the\r\nhonour of entertaining the Prince of Wales, Prince Alfred, as he was\r\nthen styled, and a very distinguished company, at dinner, in Willis's\r\nRooms, on the 9th of May, 1866. Among the guests were the veteran Sir\r\nJohn Burgoyne, the Dukes of Sutherland and Buccleuch, Earl Grey, Lord\r\nSalisbury, Sir John Pakington, Sir Edwin Landseer, Professor (Sir\r\nRichard) Owen, Baron Marochetti, the Presidents of the Royal Society and\r\nof the Royal Institute of British Architects, and representatives of\r\nvarious departments in the public service. The members and associates of\r\nthe Institution, numbering nearly two hundred, included all the civil\r\nengineers most eminent at that time, or who have since risen to\r\ndistinction. Some of the names recall notable events and achievements in\r\nour time, sometimes called \"the age of the engineers.\" Rennie,\r\nArmstrong, Bidder, Hawkshaw, Scott Russell, Hawksley, Cubitt, Penn,\r\nFairbairn, Brunlees, Brassey, Samuda, Bramwell, Bessemer, Maudsley,\r\nRawlinson, Vignoles, are on the list of those present on this memorable\r\noccasion. Mr. Fowler, President of the Institution, presided at the\r\ndinner, and in proposing the loyal toasts which are given at all such\r\nmeetings, said of the Prince of Wales, that, \"notwithstanding the\r\nnumerous duties of his exalted station, His Royal Highness has always\r\ntaken the greatest interest in those works which occupy the thoughts and\r\nlives of engineers, and therefore it is a source of peculiar\r\ngratification to the profession that His Royal Highness has been pleased\r\nto join the Institution of Civil Engineers, which had the honour to rank\r\nas its most distinguished honorary member His Royal Highness the Prince\r\nConsort.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales in returning thanks, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President, your Royal Highness, my Lords and Gentlemen, I\r\n    have indeed every reason to feel deeply flattered and gratified\r\n    at the very kind manner in which you, Mr. President, have\r\n    proposed this toast, and for the way in which it has been\r\n    received by the company present. Under any circumstances, it\r\n    would have afforded me sincere pleasure to have been present\r\n    this evening--present at a meeting of so distinguished a body as\r\n    the Civil Engineers of Great Britain; but it is still more\r\n    agreeable to me to find myself here in the position of one of\r\n    your honorary members. I thank you for the manner in which you\r\n    have mentioned my name regarding me as one of yourselves. I feel\r\n    proud to think that my lamented father was also an honorary\r\n    member of this distinguished Institution. Mr. President and\r\n    Gentlemen, perhaps it is a difficult task for me to address so\r\n    eminently scientific a body, more especially to eulogize them;\r\n    but I cannot forbear adverting to the names of two most\r\n    distinguished members of it--I allude to Mr. Brunel and Mr.\r\n    Stephenson, whose names will never be obliterated from our\r\n    memory. The important services they have rendered to this\r\n    country can never be forgotten. Let us look round at the vast\r\n    works which have been completed, or which are in the course of\r\n    completion in this country. Though it may, perhaps, seem\r\n    unnecessary, I think it is right I should on this occasion ask\r\n    you to look for a moment at the vast extension of our docks all\r\n    over this country--at the great improvements in the electric\r\n    telegraph, and also in our steamships, and, in fact, in the\r\n    general steam navigation on our waters. Let us look at what has\r\n    been done at home--and when I say at home, I mean in this\r\n    Metropolis. No one can walk over Westminster-bridge without\r\n    being struck by those magnificent quays which are being built on\r\n    either side of the river, and are commonly called the Thames\r\n    Embankment. These constitute the most important works of the\r\n    day. I must also refer to the Metropolitan Underground Railway,\r\n    which is owing to the continued exertions of your distinguished\r\n    President, and which, although not entirely completed, has been\r\n    in use for nearly three years, and has, I believe, to a\r\n    considerable extent diminished the traffic in our streets. Let\r\n    us look also at our colonies, and see the many important works\r\n    which our engineers have contrived there. I would allude more\r\n    especially to one--the celebrated bridge built over the St.\r\n    Lawrence, called the Victoria-bridge, which is close to\r\n    Montreal, and which was constructed by one of your most renowned\r\n    engineers, Mr. Stephenson. I had the honour of inaugurating that\r\n    bridge in the name of Her Majesty the Queen. I have to be\r\n    thankful to you all in many ways; but I have to be particularly\r\n    thankful to Mr. Stephenson for having built such a bridge,\r\n    because, perhaps, I should never have had an opportunity of\r\n    visiting our North American colonies and a portion of the United\r\n    States if I had not received an invitation to inaugurate that\r\n    great work. Let me thank you once more, Mr. President, for the\r\n    honour done me, and for the kind way in which the name of the\r\n    Princess of Wales has been received. And let me assure you that\r\n    it affords me the deepest gratification to have the honour of\r\n    being present this evening as one of your members.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chairman then gave the toast of \"the Army, Navy, and Volunteers,\"\r\ncoupling with it the names of Prince Alfred, Sir John Burgoyne, and\r\nColonel Erskine. The speech of Prince Alfred, in reply, is worth\r\nrecalling, as one of the earliest occasions on which he represented the\r\nprofession in which he now holds so high a position:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, your Royal Highness, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I need\r\nscarcely tell you with what pleasure I rise to respond to this toast,\r\nnor how proud I feel to hear my name associated with the Royal navy.\r\nWithin the last few years the navy has become more connected with the\r\ncivil engineers than ever it was before. Many improvements we owe--in\r\nfact, I may say all the later improvements we owe--to the civil\r\nengineers. There is only one thing they have not succeeded in doing, and\r\nthat is making us look more beautiful than we did before. Indeed, I am\r\nafraid they have rather caused us to deteriorate in appearance. I need\r\nnot add that I take, and shall continue to take, the greatest interest\r\nin this body; the more so from the fact of my father having been an\r\nhonorary member of the institution, and from my brother having now for\r\nthe first time taken his place in the same character.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH AND FOREIGN BIBLE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n_June 11th, 1866._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundation-stone of the stately edifice in Queen Victoria Street,\r\nthe head-quarters of the British and Foreign Bible Society, was laid by\r\nthe Prince of Wales, on the 11th of June, 1866. On the ground near St.\r\nAndrew's Hill, Doctors' Commons, a spacious awning stretched over an\r\narea with ranges of seats for above 2000 persons. On the platform were\r\nmany good and eminent men, most of whom--Lord Shaftesbury, Lord\r\nTeignmouth, the Archbishop of York, the Bishops of Winchester and\r\nCarlisle, the Dean of Westminster, Dr. Binney--are with us no more.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings commenced with prayer, praise, and reading some portions\r\nof Scripture appropriate to the occasion. An address was then read by\r\nthe Rev. S. B. Bergne, one of the Secretaries, giving a summary of the\r\nhistory of the Society, and stating its objects and operations.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Shaftesbury then formally requested His Royal Highness \"to\r\nundertake the solemn duty of laying the foundation stone of an edifice\r\nwhich shall be raised for the glory of God, and for the promotion of the\r\nbest interests of the human race.\" The Prince duly and formally laid the\r\nstone, and then replied to the address that had been read:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Archbishop, my Lords and Gentlemen,--I have to thank\r\n    you for the very interesting address in which you so ably set\r\n    forth the objects of this noble Institution.\r\n\r\n    \"It is now sixty-three years ago since Mr. Wilberforce, the\r\n    father of the eminent prelate who now occupies so prominent a\r\n    place in the Church of England, met, with a few friends, by\r\n    candlelight, in a small room in a dingy counting-house, and\r\n    resolved upon the establishment of the Bible Society.\r\n\r\n    \"Contrast with this obscure beginning the scene of this day,\r\n    which, not only in England and in our colonies, but in the\r\n    United States of America, and in every nation in Europe, will\r\n    awaken the keenest interest.\r\n\r\n    \"Such a reward of perseverance is always a gratifying spectacle;\r\n    much more so when the work which it commemorates is one in which\r\n    all Christians can take part, and when the object is that of\r\n    enabling every man in his own tongue to read the wonderful works\r\n    of God.\r\n\r\n    \"I have an hereditary claim to be here upon this occasion. My\r\n    grandfather, the Duke of Kent, as you have reminded me, warmly\r\n    advocated the claims of this Society; and it is gratifying to me\r\n    to reflect that the two modern versions of the Scriptures most\r\n    widely circulated--the German and English--were both, in their\r\n    origin, connected with my family. The translation of Martin\r\n    Luther was executed under the protection of the Elector of\r\n    Saxony, the collateral ancestor of my lamented father; whilst\r\n    that of William Tyndale, the foundation of the present\r\n    authorized English version, was introduced with the sanction of\r\n    the Royal predecessor of my mother the Queen, who first desired\r\n    that the Bible 'should have free course through all Christendom,\r\n    but especially in his own realm.'\r\n\r\n    \"It is my hope and trust, that, under the Divine guidance, the\r\n    wider diffusion and the deeper study of the Scriptures will, in\r\n    this as in every age, be at once the surest guarantee of the\r\n    progress and liberty of mankind, and the means of multiplying in\r\n    the purest form the consolations of our holy religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of York then invoked the Divine Blessing on the work. The\r\nBishop of Winchester, as one of the oldest living members of the\r\nSociety, expressed the grateful acknowledgments of the Committee to the\r\nPrince, for his presence among them, and for the act performed at their\r\nrequest. Two verses of the National Anthem having been sung, and the\r\nbenediction pronounced, the meeting dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor, with true civic hospitality, invited the Prince of\r\nWales, the officers of the Society, and all who had taken any part in\r\nthe ceremony to luncheon at the Mansion House. On the health of the\r\nPrince and the Princess of Wales being proposed, the Prince acknowledged\r\nthe compliment in the following words:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am, indeed, deeply touched and gratified by the toast which\r\n    has just been proposed by the Lord Mayor, and by the very kind\r\n    and feeling manner in which you have drunk to the health of the\r\n    Princess and myself. It is to me a source of sincere\r\n    gratification to receive again the hospitality of the Chief\r\n    Magistrate of the City. I can never forget, nor can the Princess\r\n    ever forget, the manner in which she was received on her first\r\n    entry into London; and although she is not here to-day--a fact\r\n    which I most deeply regret--I can bear testimony that she has\r\n    never forgotten, and never will forget, the reception given to\r\n    her three years ago. The occasion which has brought me here\r\n    to-day has given me sincere gratification. I shall be happy on\r\n    all occasions to do any thing that may tend, as the Lord Bishop\r\n    of Winchester said this morning, 'to alleviate the sufferings of\r\n    man.' But I feel sure that the work I have been enabled to\r\n    perform, small as it may be, will bear testimony to the great\r\n    good done to the poorer classes by a Society which has existed\r\n    for so many years. Sincerely I thank you for the opportunity you\r\n    have given me in coming forward on this interesting occasion,\r\n    and I shall always be happy to render every assistance in my\r\n    power to an institution which is calculated to render such\r\n    important benefits to the world. I return my best thanks for the\r\n    greeting I received this morning at the ceremony, and also for\r\n    the kind manner in which I have been received on this occasion.\"\r\n\r\nHer Majesty the Queen signified her interest in the proceedings of the\r\nday by sending £100 to the Building Fund, and £100 was also contributed\r\nby the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Bible Society has, since its establishment in 1804, issued about 113\r\nmillions of Bibles, Testaments, or portions thereof. Its issues yearly\r\nare now about four million copies. The full income in 1887 amounted to\r\n£116,761; and the sum received for Scriptures sold was £104,880. The\r\nSociety has aided the translation of the Bible into 280 languages or\r\ndialects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEND OF THE CLERGY CORPORATION.\r\n\r\n_June 13th, 1866._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth anniversary festival of this institution was celebrated at\r\nWillis's Rooms on the 13th of June, 1866. Among the guests were the\r\nArchbishops of Canterbury, York, and Armagh, and numerous dignitaries in\r\nChurch and State, the Marquis of Salisbury presiding. The Prince of\r\nWales honoured the company with his presence, and on his health being\r\nproposed by the chairman, he said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Chairman, my Lords and Gentlemen,--I feel, indeed,\r\n    deeply flattered and gratified by the kind terms in which you\r\n    have spoken of me, and by the kind manner in which my health has\r\n    been received by the company, and I have earnestly to thank you\r\n    in my own name and in the name of the Princess of Wales and of\r\n    the other members of the Royal family. Among the many charities\r\n    in this country, I believe there are few which demand our\r\n    sympathy and support more than the Friend of the Clergy\r\n    Corporation. Its object is to assist the orphans and unmarried\r\n    daughters of clergymen of the Church of England, and to afford\r\n    temporary aid to their necessitous parents. We have met here\r\n    this evening to advocate the cause of the institution, and I\r\n    believe that at the present moment the pensions which it\r\n    distributes amount to the large sum of £4000 per annum, and that\r\n    it helps to maintain 106 pensioners, while there are 60 more\r\n    persons applying for its bounty. One remarkable characteristic\r\n    of the institution is that its pensions, which never exceed £40\r\n    a year, are granted for life, and another is that these pensions\r\n    are bestowed on members of the Church not only in England, but\r\n    also in Ireland and the colonies. Young though I am, I think I\r\n    may state that I am aware from my own personal knowledge how low\r\n    are the stipends received by many of our clergymen, and I can,\r\n    therefore, support most cordially this institution. I feel,\r\n    however, some diffidence in alluding to that subject, because I\r\n    know I shall thereby be trenching on the special province of our\r\n    noble chairman. But I believe he will forgive me for saying that\r\n    I think we ought upon this occasion to show the greatest\r\n    possible liberality, and, if I may use the expression, that we\r\n    ought freely to open our purses. I can again assure you that the\r\n    Princess of Wales and the other members of the Royal family are\r\n    most ready to participate with me in the feeling of sincere\r\n    gratitude with which I now acknowledge the compliment you have\r\n    just paid us. I now thank you, too, for the kind manner in which\r\n    you have just listened to me, however imperfectly I have\r\n    expressed myself.\"\r\n\r\nIn giving the toast of \"Prosperity to the Institution,\" the noble\r\nchairman said, that after the speech which they had just heard in its\r\nfavour from His Royal Highness it was scarcely necessary for him to say\r\nanother word. He could fully confirm everything which had been said by\r\nHis Royal Highness as to its value, and the urgent need of such an\r\ninstitution was proved by the fact that there were in this kingdom no\r\nless than 10,000 clergymen who occupied benefices of less value than\r\n£150 a year. How was it possible for men with such incomes, who had to\r\nmove in a respectable sphere of life, to lay by anything for a period of\r\ndistress or to make a provision for their widows and orphans? He\r\ntherefore cordially concurred in the eloquent appeal made to them by His\r\nRoyal Highness.\r\n\r\nThe result of the appeal was a subscription list amounting to £1200,\r\nincluding 100 guineas from the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that now (1888) there are about 100 pensioners, besides\r\nspecial grants for urgent cases. Last year's receipts were £6,000, and\r\nthe invested funds are about £18,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAREHOUSEMEN AND CLERKS' SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n_June 18th, 1866._\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest public functions undertaken by the Prince (July,\r\n1863) was laying the foundation stone of the School, near Croydon, for\r\nchildren of warehousemen, clerks, and agents of wholesale houses and\r\nmanufactories, so employed in any part of the United Kingdom. The\r\nbuilding was not completed till the spring of 1866, and on the 18th of\r\nJune of that year, the Prince, on being applied to, at once and\r\ncordially agreed to preside at the inauguration or formal opening of the\r\nAsylum.\r\n\r\nThe Prince was received by Earl Russell, President of the Charity, the\r\nBishop of Winchester, the Lord Mayor of London, the High Sheriff of\r\nSurrey, and other official and distinguished persons interested in the\r\nInstitution. Having thoroughly inspected the building, the arrangements\r\nof which are admirable, and having heard an address explaining the\r\norigin and purposes of the Institution, briefly replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--It is a sincere pleasure to me to see\r\n    the work which we commenced in July, 1863, brought to a happy\r\n    conclusion. Such a consummation, when we reflect on the numerous\r\n    classes of the great commercial community of our country whose\r\n    interests it promotes, cannot but be gratifying to every one\r\n    present, and will induce us all gratefully to invoke the Divine\r\n    blessing on the ultimate success of this undertaking. The\r\n    attention that has been paid to the details of the building and\r\n    to the comforts and wellbeing of the children it is destined to\r\n    shelter, I may say, without presumption, merits this success.\r\n    And if, as you have stated, 'that which is worth doing at all is\r\n    worth doing well,' be a truth requiring any corroboration, I\r\n    have only to point to this structure for the most unanswerable\r\n    argument in its support. It only remains for me to thank you, my\r\n    lords and gentlemen, for the kind expressions you have used with\r\n    reference to the part I have taken in this day's proceedings.\"\r\n\r\nPrayer was then offered by the Bishop of Winchester, and a thanksgiving\r\nhymn sung. The ladies present then came forward with their collection\r\npurses, and amusement was caused by the hugeness of the heap of\r\nofferings that rose before the Prince, exceeding even the large sum\r\npresented when the foundation stone was laid. On this occasion upwards\r\nof one thousand ladies presented the charitable gifts, and above £5000\r\nin money or subscriptions proved to be the gratifying result. Prayer and\r\nthanksgiving were again offered, and the Prince, amid much enthusiasm,\r\ndeclared the Asylum open.\r\n\r\nThe schools, first established in 1853, had been formerly conducted in\r\nthree separate houses at New Cross, under many disadvantages. The\r\nbuilding inaugurated by the Prince of Wales is one of the most\r\ncommodious and beautiful structures possessed by any charity. Its\r\nimposing appearance and picturesque site must have been admired by many\r\ntravellers on the Brighton and South Coast Railway, near Caterham\r\nJunction. The prosperity of the Institution has been in keeping with its\r\nauspicious beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCHANT SEAMEN'S ORPHAN ASYLUM.\r\n\r\n_June 28th, 1866._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the Merchant Seamen's Orphan Asylum is sufficiently\r\nindicated by its name. Founded in 1817, the institution had for nearly\r\nfifty years been carried on with success. Upwards of 800 children had\r\nfound shelter and training, but this number represents a very small\r\nproportion of the orphans left destitute through the calamities of which\r\nmerchant seamen are constantly in peril. This asylum was at first\r\nlocated in the parish of St. George's-in-the-East, and subsequently\r\nremoved to the Borough Road, where the first stone of a new building\r\nwas, in 1861, laid by the Prince Consort. The building was opened by\r\nEarl Russell in 1862. The support given to the charity encouraged the\r\nbuilding of the present asylum, near Snaresbrook, in a healthy and\r\nbeautiful part of the country.\r\n\r\nIt was for the opening ceremony of the erection of a new dining-hall\r\nthat the Prince and Princess of Wales visited the Asylum, on the 28th of\r\nJune, 1866. Received by a guard of honour of the Hon. Artillery Company,\r\ntheir Royal Highnesses were conducted to a tent where luncheon was\r\nserved. In proposing the health of the Royal visitors, Lord Alfred\r\nPaget, who presided, said that \"he had known His Royal Highness almost,\r\nhe might say, before he knew himself, and that he could bear testimony\r\nto the interest he took, not only in every manly English sport, but in\r\neverything which tended to contribute to the advancement of such\r\ninstitutions as that whose success he testified by his presence on that\r\noccasion his desire to promote.\"\r\n\r\nIn returning thanks the Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am, indeed, deeply sensible of and deeply grateful for the\r\n    excessively kind manner in which the noble lord has proposed my\r\n    health and that of the Princess of Wales, as well as for the\r\n    very kind manner in which you all have been good enough to\r\n    receive the toast. My presence here to-day affords me the\r\n    greatest satisfaction, because we have come to honour a work\r\n    which to me is particularly interesting, inasmuch as the\r\n    foundation stone of this asylum was laid by my lamented father\r\n    in 1861. But, under any circumstances, it would be a pleasing\r\n    and a proud moment for me to be here on such an occasion as\r\n    this. We must all know how important a part our mercantile navy\r\n    plays at the present moment, and how important it is that we\r\n    should provide for the orphans of those brave men who are\r\n    exposed to so many dangers. As you are well aware, this\r\n    institution has furnished an asylum since its opening in 1862\r\n    for upwards of 180 boys and girls at a time, and it must, I am\r\n    sure, be greatly gratifying to us that I should to-day be called\r\n    upon to lay the foundation stone of an additional room, which I\r\n    understand will embrace part of the plan of the original\r\n    building. I beg again to thank you, on my own behalf and on that\r\n    of the Princess, than whom, I assure you, nobody takes greater\r\n    interest in the work which we are assembled to promote.\"\r\n\r\nLord A. Paget next proposed the toast of \"Prosperity to the Merchant\r\nSeamen's Orphan Asylum,\" which was responded to by Mr. Green, one of the\r\ndirectors.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales then rose and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have to give you the health of our noble chairman, to whom, I\r\n    think, we ought all to be very grateful for the kind manner in\r\n    which he has undertaken to perform the duties of his position on\r\n    this occasion, as well as for the interest which he manifests,\r\n    not only in this great and important charity, but in the welfare\r\n    of the sailor all over the world. I felt almost inclined to\r\n    blush at the terms in which he alluded to his friendship for\r\n    myself, and I can never forget the kindness which he has shown\r\n    towards me since my early boyhood.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was very cordially drunk, and shortly after Lord A. Paget had\r\nbriefly responded to it their Royal Highnesses paid a brief visit to the\r\nbeautiful chapel, which has been endowed for the use of the asylum at\r\nthe sole cost of Lady Morrison. An address was afterwards read,\r\nexpressing the gratification which the friends of the institution\r\nderived from the presence of their Royal Highnesses, and their\r\nthankfulness for the interest thus manifested in its prosperity. In\r\nreply the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My part in the proceedings of the day is attended with peculiar\r\n    pleasure from the circumstance of its being the anniversary of\r\n    the inauguration of this building by my lamented father. The\r\n    call for its extension by the increased numbers applying for\r\n    admission tells its own story. The steady support which the\r\n    institution has continued to receive from its commencement\r\n    encourages us to persevere in the good work so auspiciously\r\n    begun. The interest of the Queen in its welfare is, I can assure\r\n    you, fully participated in by me, and it only remains for me now\r\n    to invoke the Divine blessing on the benevolent objects which\r\n    have led to this undertaking.\"\r\n\r\nThe foundation stone was then laid with the usual formalities, and after\r\na religious service, conducted by the Archbishop of Armagh, the Royal\r\nvisitors left, amidst the cheers of the assemblage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL VISIT TO NORWICH IN 1866.\r\n\r\n_August, 1866._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time of making his home at Sandringham, the Prince of Wales,\r\nlike all English country gentlemen, has felt that his county had special\r\nclaims on his public spirit and personal exertions. Norfolk has not been\r\nslow to understand these claims, and the Prince has more than met the\r\nexpectations formed of him in regard to his county life. In the record\r\nof future years it will be seen how heartily he has associated himself,\r\nnot with the agriculture only, but with the various occupations and\r\nindustries, the works and the sports, the schools and the charities of\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest public appearances of the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales in the county chosen as their home, was at Norwich in the autumn\r\nof 1866. The time chosen by the Mayor and Corporation for the invitation\r\nto visit their city was that of the Norwich musical festival of that\r\nyear. Her Majesty the Queen of Denmark, and the Duke of Edinburgh,\r\naccompanied the Prince and Princess on this visit, which was in every\r\nway a most enjoyable and successful one. Among the attractions of the\r\nmusical festival was the performance for the first time of Sir Michael\r\nCosta's oratorio _Naaman_. The Norwich concerts of 1866 were remarkable\r\nboth in the richness of the programmes, and the rare excellence of the\r\nperformances. Seldom has opportunity been afforded of hearing such\r\nvariety of classic music, performed by the greatest vocal and\r\ninstrumental artists of the time.\r\n\r\nThe musical festival was not, however, the sole attraction. The capital\r\nof the Eastern Counties was in high festival, and other entertainments\r\nwere provided. Advantage was also taken of the Prince's presence for the\r\nceremony of opening the Drill-shed recently erected for the Norwich\r\nVolunteers. Colonel Black, the commander, in addressing the Prince,\r\nreferred to the great interest always taken by him in the organization\r\nand efficiency of the volunteer force of the country, and they had\r\ntherefore sought the honour of his inaugurating the building erected for\r\nmilitary purposes, by the volunteers of the ancient and loyal city of\r\nNorwich. The Prince replied that he had the greatest pleasure in\r\ncomplying with the request; and, having complimented the commander on\r\nthe efficiency of his corps, and the suitability of the building for its\r\npurposes, he declared the hall open. The chaplain of the battalion then\r\noffered a brief prayer. The planting of memorial trees, and other\r\nincidents associated with the Royal visit, will long be remembered by\r\nthe people of Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL NATIONAL LIFE-BOAT INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n_March 1st, 1867._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a maritime country like this, with seas crowded with shipping, and\r\nwith coasts dangerous from rocks or shoals, a lifeboat service for\r\npreservation of life from shipwreck is a necessity. The Royal National\r\nLife-boat Institution meets the want. It has now, in 1888, nearly 300\r\nstations, all round the coast. The wreck chart, which is published\r\nannually with the Society's Report, shows at a glance where wrecks are\r\nmost numerous, and there the boats of rescue are most required. It is\r\nnot only British coasting vessels that are thus provided for, but the\r\nships coming from foreign seas, and of all nations, as they crowd\r\ntowards our estuaries and ports, benefit by the lifeboat service.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March, 1867, the Prince of Wales took the chair at the\r\nannual meeting of the Institution held, through the courtesy of the Lord\r\nMayor, in the Egyptian Hall of the Mansion House. Received in the State\r\nDrawing-Room, by the chief magistrate of London, attended by the sword\r\nand mace bearers of the Corporation, the Prince was thence conducted to\r\nthe Hall, where a numerous and distinguished company had assembled. On\r\ntaking the chair, the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Mayor, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--It affords me\r\n    very great pleasure to occupy the chair to-day, upon so\r\n    interesting an occasion as the present. Among the many\r\n    benevolent and charitable institutions of this country there\r\n    are, I think, few which demand our sympathy and support more,\r\n    and in which we can feel more interest, than the National\r\n    Life-boat Institution. An institution of this kind is an\r\n    absolute necessity in a great maritime country like ours. It is\r\n    wholly different in one respect from other institutions, because\r\n    although lives are to be saved, they can in those cases in which\r\n    this society operates only be saved at the risk of the loss of\r\n    other lives. I am happy to be able to congratulate the\r\n    Institution upon its high state of efficiency at the present\r\n    moment, and upon the fact that by its means very nearly one\r\n    thousand lives have been saved in the course of the past year.\r\n\r\n    \"Lifeboats have been given by many benevolent individuals--some\r\n    as thank-offerings from the friends of those whose lives have\r\n    been saved, and others in memory of those who are unhappily no\r\n    more. I am happy also to be able to say that lifeboats do not\r\n    only exist upon our coast, but that our great example in this\r\n    matter has been imitated by many foreign maritime countries, and\r\n    they have chosen our institution as the model for their own. I\r\n    beg upon this occasion to tender, in the name of the\r\n    Institution, our warmest thanks for the kindness and courtesy of\r\n    the Lord Mayor in allowing us to hold our meeting in this hall.\r\n    It is indeed a peculiarly fitting place in which to hold such a\r\n    meeting, closely connected as the Institution is with the City\r\n    of London. Very nearly half a century ago the Institution\r\n    originated in this city. In 1850 the late Duke of Northumberland\r\n    became its president. My lamented father was also a vice-patron,\r\n    and took the warmest interest in its prosperity. I am happy to\r\n    say the respected secretary, Mr. Lewis, occupied that position\r\n    at that time, as, indeed, he had long before that time. He has\r\n    held it ever since, and much of the success of the Institution\r\n    is owing to his long experience, and the energetic manner in\r\n    which he has directed its working has raised the Institution to\r\n    its present high state of efficiency.\r\n\r\n    \"I may say that there are 174 lifeboats afloat, and that in the\r\n    course of the past year 33 have been called into existence, at a\r\n    cost of no less than £17,000, the whole of which has been\r\n    defrayed by benevolent individuals. Before concluding the brief\r\n    remarks which I have addressed to you, however imperfectly, upon\r\n    this occasion, I call upon you once more to offer your support\r\n    to so excellent an Institution. I am certain you must be\r\n    convinced that it is one which is really a necessity for a great\r\n    maritime nation like this. I congratulate you that it has\r\n    arrived at so efficient a state, and I feel quite sure that you\r\n    would be the last to wish it to decay from want of funds.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary having read the Report, and various speeches having been\r\ndelivered, donations were announced to the amount of £1200. At the\r\nluncheon, which was afterwards given in the Long Parlour, the Prince\r\nhoped that the proceedings of that day would advance the prosperity of\r\nthe Institution, the benefits of which had only to be more widely known,\r\nto be more largely supported.\r\n\r\nWe may add that the receipts, as stated in last year's report (1887),\r\nwere £56,970, and the expenditure £74,162. During the year 368 lives had\r\nbeen saved by the Society's boats, and ten vessels saved from\r\ndestruction. Besides medals and other testimonials, £3345 had been\r\ngranted in rewards. Since the formation of the Society it has voted as\r\nrewards 97 gold and 996 silver medals or clasps, 139 binocular glasses,\r\n15 telescopes, and money to the amount of £96,700. These statistics are\r\nfurnished by the present secretary, Mr. Charles Dibdin, a descendant of\r\nthe Dibdin whose naval songs are known to all sailors. British seamen\r\nare always ready to risk their lives to save their fellow men, and there\r\nis never any difficulty found in manning the lifeboats, but it is\r\nnecessary to have a permanent staff, and to keep up the stations, while\r\nthose who volunteer to imperil their own lives ought to have reward, in\r\norder to help to provide for others dependent on them. The Prince again\r\npresided at the Annual Meeting in 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY OF ANCIENT BRITONS.\r\n\r\n_March 1st, 1867._\r\n\r\n\r\nA Welsh charitable institution might claim the patronage of the Prince\r\nof Wales, from his title, apart from the sympathy shown by him towards\r\nbenevolent works amidst all classes of the people. On St. David's Day,\r\nMarch 1st, 1867, the Prince presided at the 152nd anniversary festival\r\nof this ancient and useful charity, the origin of which dates back from\r\nthe year 1715, shortly after the accession of George I.\r\n\r\nCaroline, the Princess of Wales, was born on the 1st of March of that\r\nyear; and as there were divisions and intrigues at the period, many\r\ninfluential Welshmen combined to show their loyal attachment to the\r\nHouse of Hanover.\r\n\r\nAt first the combination was probably prompted by political motives, but\r\nthe Society soon took up practical work, and founded a school for the\r\neducation of poor children of Welsh parents in London. The Scotch had\r\nalready formed similar patriotic institutions, and at a later period the\r\nIrish followed the example. On the present anniversary the Prince was\r\nsupported by a distinguished company, including several of the most\r\neminent and influential natives of the Principality.\r\n\r\nThe Health of the Queen having been drunk with enthusiasm, that of the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales was proposed by the Duke of Cambridge, who\r\nsaid that every one would agree with him in expressing the high sense\r\nwhich every body entertained of the admirable way in which His Royal\r\nHighness had supported not only the general interests of the country,\r\nbut also those of individual societies. The Prince responded in a few\r\nhearty words, saying he would always be found ready to assist charitable\r\nobjects, whether as an onlooker, or as a participator in the\r\nproceedings, as he was that night. Having returned warm thanks for the\r\nreception given to the toast, and the good wishes expressed towards\r\nhimself and the Princess of Wales, he then proposed the toast of the\r\nevening: \"Prosperity to the Welsh Charity School, and Perpetuity to the\r\nHonourable and Loyal Society of Ancient Britons.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I feel sure, Gentlemen, I shall not have to call upon you twice\r\n    to respond most heartily to this toast. You all of you must\r\n    know, perhaps far better than I can tell you, the history of\r\n    this society; but at the same time it may be well that I should\r\n    go back and give you a brief sketch of the society from its\r\n    commencement. In 1715 it was founded on St. David's Day, which\r\n    was the birthday of Caroline, Princess of Wales. My ancestor,\r\n    George II., then Prince of Wales, became the first patron of the\r\n    society. The Princess took great interest in the well-being of\r\n    the society, independent of the fact of its having been founded\r\n    in commemoration of her natal day. The school in those times was\r\n    nothing more than a day school. It was found to be too small,\r\n    and was removed to Clerkenwell, and there it flourished for some\r\n    time. In 1771 it was removed to Gray's-inn Lane, and in 1818, at\r\n    the death of the much lamented Princess Charlotte of Wales,\r\n    whose loss the whole country most deeply felt, 50 additional\r\n    children were, by means of a public subscription, sent to the\r\n    school in remembrance of her name. The school continued to\r\n    flourish, but it was thought advisable, if it could be effected,\r\n    that the institution should be removed into the country, in\r\n    order, among other advantages, that the children might derive\r\n    the benefit of the fresh air. Accordingly in 1854 the school was\r\n    removed to Ashford, and on the 13th of July, 1857, my lamented\r\n    father inaugurated and opened the school on its present site. I\r\n    am happy to say that I accompanied him on that occasion, and\r\n    from that time to this you will believe me when I assure you\r\n    that I have felt the deepest interest in the prosperity of the\r\n    school. It has frequently occurred on my journey from Windsor to\r\n    London by the South-Western line for me to notice the school as\r\n    I have passed by it, but that circumstance alone would not be\r\n    required to remind me of its claims. When the school was removed\r\n    from London to the country considerable expense was incurred; so\r\n    much so that it was rendered necessary to reduce the number of\r\n    children from 200 to 150, but I am happy to be able to inform\r\n    you that in the course of the last century and a half as many as\r\n    3000 Welsh children have been by means of this institution\r\n    clothed, fed, and educated, and afterwards sent forth into the\r\n    world provided, to a certain extent, for their future career.\r\n    This must be a gratifying announcement, and brief and imperfect\r\n    as the sketch may have been which I have now given you, still I\r\n    trust I have said enough to call upon you most heartily to\r\n    continue that support which in past years you have given on the\r\n    occasion of these annual festivals. Gentlemen, I thank you for\r\n    the kind manner in which you have been pleased to receive these\r\n    remarks, and I beg to propose to you, in a bumper, the toast of\r\n    the evening.\"\r\n\r\nOther toasts and speeches followed, and a most liberal collection was\r\nmade for the Charity, which is now generally known under the name of\r\n\"High School for Welsh Girls.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n_July 10th, 1867._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of July, 1867, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales\r\ninaugurated this institution, established under the auspices of the\r\nInternational Education Society. Some years previously a Committee, of\r\nwhich Mr. Cobden and M. Michael Chevalier were members, proposed the\r\nformation of an International College, having four principal\r\nestablishments, in England, France, Germany, and Italy. The pupils were\r\nto pursue their studies at each branch in succession. It was to\r\ninaugurate the English branch of this institution, at Spring Grove,\r\nunder the direction of Dr. Leonard Schmitz, formerly Rector of the High\r\nSchool of Edinburgh, that they assembled this day.\r\n\r\nAfter inspecting the building and grounds, the visitors assembled at\r\nluncheon, the chair being occupied by Mr. Paulton, the treasurer of the\r\nCollege, having on his right the Prince of Wales, and on his left the\r\nDuc d'Aumale. The Prince de Joinville and the Comte de Paris were also\r\namong the guests. On the health of the Prince of Wales being proposed,\r\nhe replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--I beg to thank you for\r\n    the kind manner in which you have drunk my health, and for the\r\n    feeling and touching sympathy you have evinced for the Princess\r\n    of Wales. I can assure you it gives me the greatest\r\n    gratification to be present to-day to inaugurate this College\r\n    under the auspices of the International Education Society. I\r\n    sincerely trust that this propitious weather and the goodly\r\n    company I see around me may be omens of the future of this\r\n    institution. The site of this College is all that can be\r\n    desired, and I know that its management will be so administered\r\n    as to fulfil to the utmost the anticipations of its promoters.\r\n    There is now room for 80 pupils within its walls, and when the\r\n    new wings are completed it will be capable of accommodating\r\n    twice, probably treble, that number. There are, I understand,\r\n    two sister institutions abroad--one in Germany, and the other in\r\n    France; and after the pupils have completed their studies here\r\n    they can avail themselves of the advantages of these\r\n    institutions to perfect themselves in modern Continental\r\n    languages.\r\n\r\n    \"I am not going to discuss the relative claims on our attention\r\n    of the living and dead languages; but I believe it to be most\r\n    important that modern languages should form one of the principal\r\n    subjects of study on grounds of practical utility. No persons\r\n    were ever more deeply impressed with this fact than my late\r\n    lamented father, and another man whose name is now celebrated\r\n    through England, Richard Cobden. I have travelled a great deal\r\n    on the Continent, and I am confident that I should have found my\r\n    sojourn in these countries far less pleasant than it was if I\r\n    had not possessed a considerable knowledge of the vernacular of\r\n    the people.\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you again sincerely for the manner in which you have\r\n    drunk my health, and I shall convey to the Princess the deep\r\n    sympathy you have evinced for her in her illness, the\r\n    enthusiastic affection with which you have received her name,\r\n    and your warm good wishes for her speedy restoration to health.\r\n    Before sitting down I beg to propose a toast, which I am sure\r\n    you will receive with every demonstration of approbation. It is\r\n    \"Success to the London College of the International Education\r\n    Society.\" With that toast I beg to couple the name of Dr.\r\n    Schmitz, whose pupil, I am proud to say, I once was while\r\n    studying in the city of Edinburgh.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast having been received with great enthusiasm, Dr. Schmitz, in\r\nreply, said he had to thank His Royal Highness for the kindness of heart\r\nwith which he had spoken of his humble name, and hoped that the College\r\nso happily inaugurated would have a prosperous issue. The distinctive\r\nfeature of the institution was that in it the study of modern languages\r\nand natural sciences were to be largely pursued. The dead languages,\r\nhowever, were not to be ignored. They protested only against the\r\nexclusive study of classical literature. He had himself devoted his life\r\nto letters, but at the same time he fully recognized the claims of the\r\nmodern continental tongues and the natural sciences, by which the\r\ncivilization and progress of the world were unquestionably advanced.\r\nProfessor Huxley then proposed the \"Health of the Committee of\r\nManagement,\" coupling with it the name of the chairman. The Chairman\r\nhaving briefly replied, the meeting broke up, and the visitors dispersed\r\nthroughout the grounds for promenade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VICEROY OF EGYPT, ISMAIL PASHA, AT THE MANSION HOUSE.\r\n\r\n_July 11th, 1867._\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many illustrious rulers of foreign nations who have been\r\nentertained by the Lord Mayor of London, have been three Viceroys of\r\nEgypt. On the 11th of July, 1867, at a banquet at the Mansion House, a\r\ndistinguished company assembled to meet his Highness the Viceroy, Ismail\r\nPasha. Twenty-one years previously, the father, and on a subsequent\r\noccasion the brother of the Viceroy had been similarly honoured in the\r\ncapital of the British Empire. The Prince of Wales, the Duke of\r\nCambridge, Prince Teck, Prince Edward of Saxe Weimar, many of the\r\nambassadors of foreign powers, and the most eminent men of all shades of\r\npolitical opinion were among the company.\r\n\r\nThe reply of the Viceroy, to the toast, given by the Lord Mayor, was\r\nresponded to in his native tongue, and interpreted by Nubar Pasha in\r\nFrench: \"If Egypt had rendered services to England, chiefly in\r\nfacilitating communication with India, his country was only\r\nacknowledging the debt due to this country for the benefits received in\r\npromoting the material and the moral progress of his people.\"\r\n\r\nThe next toast was the health of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and\r\nthe other members of the Royal Family, to which the Prince thus\r\nresponded:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Mayor, your Royal Highnesses, my Lords, Ladies, and\r\n    Gentlemen, I beg to thank you most warmly and sincerely for the\r\n    kind manner in which you, my Lord Mayor, have proposed my health\r\n    and that of the Princess of Wales, and the other members of the\r\n    Royal Family; and to thank the company here present for the way\r\n    in which it has been received. I need not assure you, my Lord\r\n    Mayor, that to have been invited here this evening has been a\r\n    source of great pleasure to me. Under any circumstances I always\r\n    feel it a great compliment to be invited to the hospitable board\r\n    of the Lord Mayor and the Corporation of the city of London.\r\n\r\n    \"But this evening we have been invited here to do honour to a\r\n    guest, and that guest the Viceroy of Egypt. As the Lord Mayor\r\n    has very truly remarked, England and Egypt, though far distant\r\n    from one another, though very different from one another in\r\n    religion and in habits, are countries which have been, and will\r\n    continue to be, closely allied to one another. We have every\r\n    reason to be grateful to the Viceroy and to his Government for\r\n    the means he has afforded us of visiting that country, and for\r\n    the great hospitality that he has shown to us on all occasions.\r\n    I myself received distinguished marks of kindness under the rule\r\n    of his brother, the late Viceroy, in 1862. Nothing could exceed\r\n    the kindness and courtesy with which I was treated, and the\r\n    facilities with which I was enabled to visit that most\r\n    interesting country. We are also indebted to the Viceroy and the\r\n    Egyptian Government for the great facilities he has afforded our\r\n    troops in their transit to India.\r\n\r\n    \"Egypt, as has been remarked, is a country that is fast\r\n    improving in every way. Manufactures are rising on all\r\n    sides--especially the manufacture of cotton. I myself visited a\r\n    very important sugar manufactory, and it was interesting to find\r\n    that there were English, French, and German workmen employed in\r\n    that manufactory.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not wish, my Lord Mayor, to take up more of your time this\r\n    evening, knowing that there are other toasts to be proposed. I\r\n    will, therefore, conclude by again thanking you once more for\r\n    the honour you have done me in drinking my health, and for the\r\n    very kind expressions you have used towards the Princess of\r\n    Wales. I know I only express her feelings when I say that she\r\n    has been deeply touched by that universal good feeling and\r\n    sympathy which has been shown to her during her long and painful\r\n    illness. Thank God she has now nearly recovered, and I trust\r\n    that in a month's time she will be able to leave London and\r\n    enjoy the benefits of fresh air.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFESTIVAL OF ST. PATRICK.\r\n\r\n_March 17th, 1868._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn various occasions, the Prince of Wales has shown on Irish soil, his\r\nsympathy with the people of the Sister Isle, and has been always\r\nwelcomed with warm and loyal feeling by the mass of the population. He\r\nhas given practical proof of his good feeling for the Irish nation by\r\nbeing a patron and supporter of the Benevolent Society of St. Patrick,\r\nin the schools of which the children of poor Irish parents residing in\r\nthe Metropolis receive education and other benefits.\r\n\r\nThe annual festival has long been well attended and supported, but never\r\nbefore was there so great and brilliant a gathering as when the Prince\r\nof Wales, on the 17th of March, 1868, presided at the dinner, at\r\nWillis's Rooms. Among the company were the Archbishop of Armagh, the\r\nBishop of Derry, and many members of the House of Lords, and of the\r\nHouse of Commons, connected with Ireland, with other distinguished\r\npersons of all classes interested in the charity. The London Irish\r\nVolunteers formed a guard of honour in front of the building, and the\r\nPrince on entering, and taking his place as president, was greeted with\r\nenthusiastic cheers.\r\n\r\nThe usual loyal toasts having been given, and responded to by the\r\nPrince, with warm appreciation of the good-will, especially directed\r\ntowards the Princess of Wales, on her health being proposed by the\r\nArchbishop of Armagh, the Prince proposed \"The Army and Navy, the\r\nMilitia and the Volunteers,\" saying some suitable words as to each\r\nbranch of the united services.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Longford briefly replied for the Army. Mr. Corry, in\r\nresponding for the Navy, said he believed that St. Patrick had never\r\nbeen so far south as that fine harbour which was \"_statio bene fida\r\ncarinis_.\" Complaints had been made from time to time that the\r\nGovernment had not availed themselves of the facilities which Cork\r\nharbour afforded for dockyard accommodation, but after the works at\r\nHaulbowline were completed, he hoped that the people of Cork would see\r\nthat the Admiralty had no desire to do any injustice to Ireland in\r\nrespect of the navy. He was glad to announce to the company that on the\r\noccasion of the forthcoming visit of the Prince of Wales to Dublin a\r\ndivision of the armour-clad vessels of the Channel fleet would be sent\r\nto the Bay of Dublin, where, weather permitting, the ships of the\r\ndivision would anchor and remain during the time His Royal Highness was\r\nto stay in Ireland.\r\n\r\nCaptain M. J. O'Connell, in returning thanks for the Volunteers,\r\nremarked that in the London Irish there never had been any political or\r\npolemical disputes.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the proceedings there occurred a scene thoroughly \"racy\r\nof the soil\" of which most of the noblemen and gentlemen present were\r\nnatives. The children of the schools were brought into the room, and\r\n\"St. Patrick's Day\" having been struck up by the band, the boys and\r\ngirls proceeded to make the circuit of the tables. The national air of\r\nIreland told alike on the benefactors and the recipients of the charity.\r\nThe children looked with glistening eyes on the company, and the latter,\r\nas the young ones passed by, loaded them with fruit and cakes to such an\r\nextent that before the juvenile procession had made its exit from the\r\napartment the tables had been cleared of the entire dessert, which was a\r\nvery liberal one. The boys and girls raised a loud cheer as they left\r\nthe room, and the entire company, including the illustrious President,\r\nappeared all the happier for having made the festival the means of so\r\nunusual a treat for the little sons and daughters of poor Irish parents\r\nstruggling for their living in London.\r\n\r\nAfter the performance of a selection of Irish airs, the Prince of Wales\r\nagain rose and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen.--The next toast which I shall have the\r\n    honour of proposing to you is the toast of the evening. We are\r\n    here to-night for a very excellent and charitable purpose. The\r\n    objects of the Benevolent Society of St. Patrick have been so\r\n    often stated--so many able speeches have been made at so many\r\n    successive anniversaries of this festival, that there is very\r\n    little left for me to say; but having accepted, which I did with\r\n    pleasure, the post of chairman this evening, I feel it is due to\r\n    the institution and to this company that I should make a few\r\n    observations. I may as well at once say that I am about to call\r\n    upon you to drink prosperity to the Benevolent Society of St.\r\n    Patrick. This Society was instituted in 1784, with the object of\r\n    relieving the necessitous children of Irish parents resident in\r\n    London. One of its first patrons was my grandfather, the Duke of\r\n    Kent. I have always understood that he took a very great\r\n    interest in the Society, and I may further observe that several\r\n    of my grand-uncles acted as presidents at your annual dinners.\r\n    At the present moment I believe the schools are in what may be\r\n    called a flourishing condition, They afford education to as many\r\n    as 400 children. That the boys and girls are in good health and\r\n    thriving is, I think, pretty evident, from the appearance they\r\n    presented as they passed through the room just now. A special\r\n    feature in the conduct of the schools is that no doctrinal\r\n    teaching is permitted. They are entirely national and\r\n    non-sectarian schools. At the same time the children are\r\n    strongly advised to attend the instructions given by the\r\n    ministers of the religion in which their parents wish them to be\r\n    brought up, and they are afforded an opportunity of doing so\r\n    every week. If it is thought desirable, the children are\r\n    apprenticed on leaving school. This system has been found to\r\n    work remarkably well. Inducements are held out for proficiency\r\n    and good conduct by rewards given after examination. A\r\n    comparatively new feature in the management of the institution\r\n    is this--that at times when the parents are enduring hardships\r\n    and perhaps privations owing to the want of work--when they may\r\n    not have a sufficiency of daily bread for the maintenance of\r\n    their families, as, for instance, during severe winter weather,\r\n    when many poor people find it difficult to obtain employment--a\r\n    daily meal is given to children who are in want of it. This has\r\n    been found to afford much assistance to the parents as well as\r\n    the children, and may therefore be regarded as a satisfactory\r\n    addition to the arrangements of the managers. I am informed that\r\n    of late years the institution has lost many valuable patrons and\r\n    supporters, but I should hope that any void in this way may\r\n    speedily be filled up. My Lords and Gentlemen,--though this may\r\n    be called an annual festival in aid of a charity, and in this\r\n    respect it is exceedingly useful, it has also another advantage.\r\n    It has long been regarded as an occasion when Irishmen living in\r\n    London may meet together without sectarian feelings or political\r\n    allusions. Such meetings are beneficial, and they must be all\r\n    the more so when their main object is the furtherance of a most\r\n    excellent institution like the Benevolent Society of St.\r\n    Patrick, prosperity to which I now ask you to drink.\"\r\n\r\n    The illustrious President next gave \"The Lord-Lieutenant of\r\n    Ireland,\" and in doing so said, \"he was sure every one would\r\n    agree with him in thinking that Lord Abercorn had filled his\r\n    high office with credit to himself and benefit to the country.\r\n    His Excellency had had a very arduous task to perform. During\r\n    Lord Abercorn's administration there had been great troubles in\r\n    Ireland, but it was to be hoped that these were almost at an\r\n    end.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Mayo, in returning thanks for the Lord-Lieutenant, expressed\r\nhis opinion that the Prince of Wales on his forthcoming visit to Ireland\r\nwould experience such a reception as would induce His Royal Highness to\r\ngo there again.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Kimberley, in proposing the health of the illustrious\r\nPresident, said he thought the friends of Ireland ought to feel much\r\nobliged to His Royal Highness for his presence there that evening. He\r\nwas convinced that good would result from it. Having on one occasion,\r\nwhile filling the office of Lord-Lieutenant, had the honour to receive\r\nthe Prince of Wales at Dublin, he could state from his own knowledge\r\nthat His Royal Highness took the deepest interest in all that concerned\r\nthe welfare of Ireland, and showed the greatest anxiety to make himself\r\nacquainted with her affairs. The Prince had made himself acquainted with\r\nher affairs, and was in a position to give an intelligent and a just\r\nopinion on the matter. This was of great importance for Ireland. He\r\nthought he might venture to say that the Prince of Wales felt an\r\naffection for Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with all the honours, and with unusual enthusiasm.\r\nThe Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am exceedingly gratified by the very kind terms in which my\r\n    noble friend has proposed my health, and the more than cordial\r\n    manner in which you, my lords and gentlemen, have received it. I\r\n    hope I need not assure you that it has been a source of great\r\n    pleasure to me to take the chair at a dinner in aid of a society\r\n    which does so much for the benefit of so many children of the\r\n    poorer Irish in London. My noble friend has alluded to my\r\n    approaching visit to Ireland. I shall only say that I am glad to\r\n    visit a portion of the United Kingdom in which I have\r\n    experienced such extensive kindness from all parties. I agree\r\n    with the noble Lord the Chief Secretary for Ireland. If this\r\n    visit should tend to give pleasure to the people of Ireland I\r\n    hope there may be a longer visit hereafter. During the course of\r\n    the last two years there has been much that has been\r\n    disagreeable to loyal Irishmen; but I am convinced that the\r\n    people of Ireland generally are thoroughly true and loyal, and\r\n    that the disaffection which has existed will only be of short\r\n    duration. It has not been engrafted on the minds of any portion\r\n    of the Irish people by the Irish people themselves. But as we\r\n    are assembled here for a purely charitable object this is not\r\n    the place for political allusions. I shall, therefore, conclude\r\n    by once more thanking you for the kind way in which you have\r\n    drunk my health, and for the manner in which you have supported\r\n    me this evening.\"\r\n\r\nThe amount contributed to the funds of the charity was about £1200,\r\nwhich included 100 guineas from the Queen, and a similar sum from the\r\nPrince of Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN AND CARNARVON.\r\n\r\n_April 15-25th, 1868._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe projected visit to Ireland, referred to in a previous article on St.\r\nPatrick's festival, took place in April, 1868. It was a successful and\r\nmemorable visit in every way. On the 15th of April the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales, who had started from Holyhead at 4 A.M., arrived in\r\nKingstown Harbour at 9.30, and landed amidst salutes from the fleet\r\nattending the Royal yacht. On the way to Dublin Castle they were\r\nreceived with enthusiasm by the crowds. The streets and houses were\r\nprofusely decorated with banners and evergreens. \"Welcome to Erin\" was\r\nthe burden of the mottoes. No troops lined the way, but reliance was put\r\non the loyal and hospitable spirit of the people, who kept the track\r\nclear for the cortège, and when the escort had passed the crowd closed\r\nin behind, like the waters in the wake of a ship which has passed\r\nthrough. At night the city was brilliantly illuminated. Next day the\r\nroyal party went to Punchestown races in open carriages, and were\r\ngreeted with enthusiasm as great as on the first entrance to Dublin. On\r\nSaturday the Prince was installed, with great ceremony, a Knight of St.\r\nPatrick, in St. Patrick's Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe Prince was belted with the same sword worn by George IV. In the\r\nevening his Excellency the Lord-Lieutenant entertained the Knight, the\r\nRoyal visitors, and a distinguished company, at dinner in St. Patrick's\r\nHall. In proposing the health of the Prince and the Princess of Wales,\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant said that \"the shouts of acclamation that for four\r\nsuccessive days have rung in our ears, will have shown to the\r\nillustrious Heir of these Kingdoms, better than any words of mine, the\r\nkindly nature of the Irish people, and the attachment that may be\r\nawakened in their generous and warm hearts.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness, in returning thanks, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Excellency's, your Royal Highnesses, my Lords, Ladies, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--In the name of the Princess of Wales and myself, I\r\n    beg to tender you my warmest thanks for the very kind and\r\n    flattering manner in which this toast has been proposed, and for\r\n    the cordial way in which it has been received by the company\r\n    present here this evening. Under any circumstances I should feel\r\n    it a great honour to have my health proposed by his Excellency\r\n    the Lord-Lieutenant, but to-night the circumstances under which\r\n    it has been proposed are peculiar, for I appear here as a Knight\r\n    of the Illustrious Order of St. Patrick. I can assure you that\r\n    I feel very proud to wear this evening for the first time the\r\n    star and riband of this illustrious Order; and I am very\r\n    grateful to Her Majesty the Queen for having given it to me. On\r\n    former occasions I have received the Orders of Great Britain\r\n    from Her Majesty's own hands; and, although I cannot but regret\r\n    that on this occasion she has not been able to give this Order\r\n    to me herself, still it was the Queen's wish that I should\r\n    receive it on Irish soil, from the hands of her representative,\r\n    the Lord-Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n    \"This Order was first founded, now more than 80 years ago, by my\r\n    great-grandfather, King George III., and was instituted by him\r\n    as a mark of his goodwill and friendship towards this country,\r\n    and it is my hope that, as his great-grandson, having to-day\r\n    received it on Irish soil, I may also be instrumental in\r\n    evincing in this country, in the name of my Sovereign and my\r\n    mother, her goodwill and friendship towards Ireland. I feel also\r\n    proud that I have been not only invested with the insignia of\r\n    this Order, but installed in the magnificent Cathedral of St.\r\n    Patrick, for the restoration of which we are indebted to the\r\n    great munificence of a private gentleman of Ireland, whose name\r\n    is so well known that I need not mention it to you, more\r\n    particularly as I have the pleasure of seeing him at this table.\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen, I am very glad to have this opportunity\r\n    of stating to you, on behalf of the Princess and myself, how\r\n    deeply gratified we are by the reception which has been accorded\r\n    to us in this country, not only, as the Lord-Lieutenant has\r\n    observed, by the higher classes, but by the sons of the soil as\r\n    well. After the sad times of the past year it might, perhaps,\r\n    have been thought by some that our reception would not have been\r\n    all that could have been wished. I myself felt confident that it\r\n    would, and my hopes have been indeed realised. I beg, therefore,\r\n    to offer, not only to those present who participated more\r\n    immediately in our reception, but to the whole Irish people, our\r\n    thanks for the cordial, hearty, and friendly welcome which we\r\n    have received. I will not weary you with more words, but thank\r\n    you once more for the honour you have done us in so heartily\r\n    drinking our healths.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, we are told, spoke with an unaffected earnestness which\r\ndeepened the impression left by his words. The reference to \"the sad\r\ntimes of the past year\" included the wretched Clerkenwell explosion\r\naffair, the perpetrators of which outrage were on their trial in London,\r\nat the very time when the people of Dublin were showing their loyal\r\nattachment to the throne, and observing the most remarkable order and\r\ndecorum, even in the most crowded and poverty-stricken districts.\r\n\r\nBesides an incessant round of banquets, receptions, concerts, balls, and\r\nwhat are humorously called \"entertainments,\" the Royal visitors devoted\r\nmuch time to inspecting museums, libraries, hospitals, colleges,\r\nschools, including some sights not usually attractive to strangers, such\r\nas the collections of preparations and curiosities in the College of\r\nSurgeons, and the College of Physicians. The antiquities in the Royal\r\nHibernian Academy's rooms were duly inspected; a conversazione at the\r\nRoyal Dublin Society attended; a flower-show at the Rotunda; The\r\nCatholic University in Stephen's Green visited; and above all there were\r\nsplendid doings at Trinity College, where the Prince (and at the same\r\ntime, the Duke of Cambridge, and Lord Abercorn) received the investiture\r\nof honorary Doctor of Laws. After this the Royal LL.D. went out,\r\nunrobed, to unveil the statue of Edmund Burke.\r\n\r\nThen there was the Cattle Show, for it happened that the usual spring\r\nmeeting of the Royal Dublin Society fell at the very time of the\r\nPrince's visit. Of course there was also a review in Phoenix Park, and\r\non this occasion the military spectacle was of unusual brilliancy.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 19th, His Royal Highness attended the service in Christ\r\nChurch, a cathedral exceeded by few in historic interest.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the many engagements in Dublin, visits were paid to Lord\r\nPowerscourt's beautiful domain, with the romantic and classical scenes\r\nof county Wicklow; and to the Duke of Leinster at Carton, and to\r\nMaynooth College, fifteen miles off. The President, Dr. Russell, with\r\nthe officials, formally received the Prince, while the hundreds of\r\nstudents gave him a cheerful welcome in the great quadrangle.\r\n\r\nIt would occupy too much space to mention all the incidents crowded into\r\nthe days of the Irish sojourn. They are all recorded in full detail, in\r\nthe newspapers of the period, and especially in the columns of the\r\n_Times_, who sent a special correspondent to chronicle the events, day\r\nby day. In a leading article of the _Times_, the writer gives a summary\r\nof the proceedings, and makes comments on what might be the result of\r\nthe Royal visit. Some sentences of this article we quote as showing what\r\nwas the impression made at the time by the Prince himself:--\r\n\r\n\"Any reader of our daily correspondence could easily make out a hundred\r\ndistinct occasions during these ten days on which the Prince, most\r\nfrequently with the Princess, had to be face to face with some portion\r\nof the people, in some ceremony or other, and had to perform a part\r\nrequiring all the graces and gifts of Royalty. There were presentations\r\nand receptions; receiving and answering addresses; processions, walking,\r\nriding, and driving, in morning, evening, military, academic, and\r\nmediæval attire. The Prince was invested as a Knight, robed as an LL.D.,\r\nand made a Lord of the Irish Privy Council; he had to breakfast, lunch,\r\ndine, and sup with more or less publicity every twenty-four hours. He\r\nhad to go twice to races with fifty or a hundred thousand people about\r\nhim; to review a small army and make a tour in the Wicklow mountains, of\r\ncourse everywhere receiving addresses under canopies, and dining in\r\nstate under galleries full of spectators. He visited and inspected\r\ninstitutions, colleges, universities, academies, libraries, and cattle\r\nshows. He had to take a very active part in assemblies of from several\r\nhundred to several thousand dancers, and always to select for his\r\npartners the most important personages. He had to introduce the statue\r\nof Burke to the wind and rain of his country. He had to listen to many\r\nspeeches sufficiently to know when and what to answer. He had to examine\r\nwith respectful interest pictures, books, antiquities, relics,\r\nmanuscripts, specimens, bones, fossils, prize beasts, and works of Irish\r\nart. He had never to be unequal to the occasion, however different from\r\nthe last or however like the last, and whatever his disadvantage as to\r\nthe novelty or the dullness of the matter and the scene. He was always\r\nbefore persons who were there at home, on their own ground, and amid\r\npersons and objects familiar to them, and sometimes in a manner made by\r\nthem. Be it Cardinal, Chancellor, Rector, Mayor, Commanding Officer,\r\nPresident, Chairman, or local deputation, he had to hold his own,\r\nwithout even seeming to do so--that is, without effort or self\r\nassertion. All this he had to do continually for ten days. Now, men of\r\ncommon would know what an anxious thing it is to have to do this even\r\nonce, and how utterly they may be upset by the concurrence of two or\r\nthree such occasions.\"\r\n\r\nAll this and more the Prince had to do and to suffer during his visit.\r\nThe speeches if not long, were numerous and appropriate. Altogether the\r\nIrish campaign of 1868 was not an easy one. Let it be remembered with\r\nthe more honour.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of April, the Royal visitors returned to Holyhead, and\r\nstopping at Carnarvon, the birthplace of the first Prince of Wales,\r\nreceived a public greeting, and an address. At a banquet subsequently\r\ngiven, the Prince thus responded to the toast given by the High Sheriff\r\nof the County:--\r\n\r\n    \"On behalf of the Princess and myself I return our warmest\r\n    thanks for the kind way in which our health has been proposed,\r\n    and for the manner in which it has been received. It has\r\n    afforded the Princess and myself the very greatest pleasure to\r\n    come to North Wales and visit the ancient castle of Carnarvon.\r\n    It is particularly interesting to us to come upon this day, the\r\n    anniversary of the birthday of the first Prince of Wales. For a\r\n    long time it had been our intention to pay a visit to Wales, and\r\n    I regret that that intention has been so long in the fulfilment;\r\n    but the cordial reception which we have received to-day will, I\r\n    am sure, lead us to look forward with great pleasure to another\r\n    visit on some future day. We deeply regret that our stay should\r\n    be so short, and that, it being necessary for us to go\r\n    homewards, we cannot remain longer with you. I thank you once\r\n    more for the kind way in which you have received the few words I\r\n    have addressed to you, and for the welcome we have received from\r\n    the people of Carnarvon.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness concluded by proposing the health of the\r\nLords-Lieutenant, the High Sheriffs, and the Mayors of the towns and\r\ncounties of North Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY OF FRIENDS OF FOREIGNERS IN DISTRESS.\r\n\r\n_May 5th, 1868._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no form of charity more obviously suitable and good, than\r\nhelping distressed strangers in a strange land, and especially\r\nforeigners in London. The sixty-second anniversary of the \"Society of\r\nFriends of Foreigners in Distress\" was celebrated on May 5th, 1868, at\r\nWillis's Rooms, under the presidency of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales. The\r\nguests included many representatives of various nations, the charity\r\nitself being cosmopolitan, and helping the distressed of all races and\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n    In proposing the health of \"The Queen, the Protectress of the\r\n    Society,\" the Prince observed that \"Her Majesty had shown a deep\r\n    interest in the charity, ever since 1837, the year of her\r\n    accession to the throne, when she became an annual subscriber;\r\n    and his lamented father became its protector at his marriage,\r\n    and continued to subscribe to its funds.\"\r\n\r\nIn proposing the health of the Prince and Princess of Wales, Sir Travers\r\nTwiss, her Majesty's Advocate-General, said that he was not merely\r\nfollowing the high example of his august mother and lamented father, but\r\nwas moved by his own kind disposition. As it was not generally known,\r\nhe took the liberty of mentioning, even in his presence, that the\r\nPrince, in the course of his Eastern travels, passed through no great\r\ncity without having visited its institutions in aid of suffering\r\nhumanity; and it was still fresh in the memory of those who were around\r\nhim how much his heart was touched at the sight of the shelter afforded\r\nby British and American philanthropy to the unfortunate Syrian\r\nChristians, who had been driven from their homes at Damascus, and found\r\na temporary asylum among the European residents at Beyrout.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness, in returning thanks, expressed the high pleasure it\r\nwas to be present in support of the institution, and proposed the health\r\nof the \"Foreign Sovereigns and Governments--protectors and patrons of\r\nthe Institution,\" coupling with the toast the name of his Excellency the\r\nPrussian Ambassador; to which Count Bernstorff responded.\r\n\r\nIn proposing the principal toast of the evening, His Royal Highness said\r\nthat he was sure it would be received with enthusiasm:--\r\n\r\n    \"The 'Society of Friends of Foreigners in Distress' was the\r\n    first of the kind established in London, and its object was to\r\n    afford assistance to deserving and necessitous foreigners in\r\n    this country, without distinction of nationality, religion, age,\r\n    or sex. This institution, which had now existed for more than\r\n    sixty years, was even at the time of its initiation thought to\r\n    be a work of necessity; how much more so had it become such\r\n    since the means of communication between country and country had\r\n    been so vastly increased, and trade, manufactures, and commerce\r\n    had so largely attracted the people of other nations to our\r\n    shores!\r\n\r\n    \"The charitable objects of the society were first to grant\r\n    allowances to deserving foreigners in their old age. Pensioners\r\n    were elected by the governors, and the Board of Directors paid\r\n    the pensions annually. The second object was to grant temporary\r\n    relief in time of sickness. These cases were inquired into with\r\n    the greatest care, and sums from a few shillings up to £5 or £10\r\n    were sometimes given where the cases required it. A third object\r\n    was to afford temporary assistance to the younger members of\r\n    families when the heads of the families were by infirmity or ill\r\n    health unable to support them; but when such relief had been\r\n    once afforded to any extent a period of eight weeks was required\r\n    to elapse before any further help was rendered, unless in cases\r\n    of great emergency. The fourth and last object of the society\r\n    was to afford means by which foreigners might be able to return\r\n    to their native country. As many as 243 families had been\r\n    enabled to return to their native country by the assistance\r\n    rendered to them by this society. Several of the families so\r\n    assisted had been induced to quit their native land in that\r\n    unfortunate expedition to Mexico. They had engaged in what they\r\n    thought was a good cause, but when that fell to the ground,\r\n    owing to events that occurred last year, those poor creatures\r\n    were totally unprovided for, and then it was that the society\r\n    granted them the means of returning to their native country.\r\n\r\n    \"There were some almshouses at Lower Norwood belonging to the\r\n    society, in which several families were comfortably lodged and\r\n    maintained. Since the origin of the society as many as 116,000\r\n    cases had received its attention and aid. Last year 3000 persons\r\n    were assisted, not including the 243 families that were enabled\r\n    to return to their native home. Similar societies had recently\r\n    sprung up, but they all differed from the one they were then\r\n    celebrating in this respect, that they confined their assistance\r\n    to the natives of certain countries, while this society had for\r\n    its object the giving relief to foreigners of all nations. He\r\n    had one more statement to make which had only been mentioned to\r\n    him a few minutes ago. There was a gentleman present who was\r\n    well known to them, but did not wish his name to be announced,\r\n    who had already given £1000 to the society, and who had\r\n    expressed himself ready to give an additional £100 if he could\r\n    find nine other gentlemen who would each give a like sum. He\r\n    hoped the society would be able to find those nine gentlemen to\r\n    assist them. Having made this brief statement, he begged to\r\n    propose that the toast be drunk up-standing with three times\r\n    three.\"\r\n\r\nThe call was heartily responded to, and, after some further\r\ncomplimentary and formal toasts, His Royal Highness and the principal\r\nguests retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n_May 13th, 1868._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs President of the Governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, the Prince\r\nof Wales has always taken a warm and active interest in the affairs of\r\nthat great charitable institution. On the 13th of May, 1868, he took the\r\nchair at what is called the annual \"View\" dinner. It is the custom on\r\nthat day for some of the Governors to make a visitation of the wards and\r\nother departments of the Hospital. On this occasion the Royal President\r\nvisited six of the wards. At the dinner he was supported by Prince\r\nChristian, the Bishop of Oxford, and other distinguished guests, as well\r\nas the officials of the Hospital. After dinner the Royal President rose\r\nand said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--The first toast which I have the\r\n    honour to submit to you I propose in the form in which it has\r\n    always been given at this anniversary festival; it is 'The\r\n    Church and the Queen.' I need hardly remind you that the Queen\r\n    takes the liveliest interest in the hospitals of the country,\r\n    and she has to-day evinced that interest by laying the\r\n    foundation-stone of the sister hospital of St. Thomas. Although\r\n    the Queen, as I understand, has never visited this hospital, I\r\n    trust that before long I may induce her to do so, and that I may\r\n    have the honour of showing her over it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Oxford responded, and in proposing the health of \"The\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales, and the rest of the Royal Family,\" said\r\nthat the presence of the Royal President that day was not only a tribute\r\nto humanity, most graceful in the heir of a hundred kings, but it was\r\nalso a tribute to the highest of human science, a tribute as much to the\r\nnoble profession of medicine, to those who ministered to the relief of\r\nhuman sufferings, as to the sufferers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Royal President said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--I thank you for the toast that has\r\n    just been given by the right rev. prelate, and has been so\r\n    kindly received. In responding to the very kind words in which\r\n    my health has been proposed, I can assure you it has given me\r\n    more than ordinary pleasure to be President of this hospital and\r\n    to take the chair, for the first time, at its anniversary\r\n    festival. My only regret has been and is, that the many duties\r\n    devolving upon me do not allow me to come here oftener than I\r\n    have done; but you may be sure I take the greatest interest in\r\n    the hospital, and the more the Treasurer tells me of what is\r\n    going on in the hospital the better I shall be pleased. Whenever\r\n    I have availed myself of an opportunity of visiting the hospital\r\n    I have found it in a condition which left nothing to be desired.\r\n    The Princess of Wales has also taken as great an interest in it\r\n    as I have done, and as soon as she could move about after her\r\n    return from abroad she accompanied me on a visit to this\r\n    hospital. In the name of the Princess of Wales and the other\r\n    members of the Royal Family I return thanks for the manner in\r\n    which this toast has been drunk.\"\r\n\r\nIn proposing the next toast, \"The Army, Navy, Militia, and Volunteers,\"\r\nthe Royal President said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I always think that this is a puzzling toast for a chairman to\r\n    give, although at the same time it is an easy one, because so\r\n    many have given it, and will continue to give it, that there is,\r\n    unfortunately, little scope for originality and variety in\r\n    proposing it. On such an occasion as this, however, and in a\r\n    hospital, too, it is a most appropriate toast, because medical\r\n    departments are essential in our army and navy, and medical\r\n    science is specially invoked by their active services. Alas that\r\n    it should be so! But, fortunately, in our last campaign, in\r\n    Abyssinia, there was less call than ever for medical science on\r\n    our own side, as only one person was wounded in action.\"\r\n\r\nOther customary toasts having been given, the Royal President again\r\nrose, and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"The toast I have now the honour to propose you will receive\r\n    with enthusiasm: it is, 'Prosperity to St. Bartholomew's\r\n    Hospital, and Health and Ease to the Patients.' It gives me the\r\n    greatest pleasure to propose this toast. This hospital, the\r\n    largest and most ancient of the metropolitan hospitals, was\r\n    founded in 1123 by Rahere, and was then attached to the Priory;\r\n    and on the suppression of the monasteries, in 1544, it had a\r\n    charter granted to it by Henry VIII., whose portrait occupies\r\n    the wall on my right. At that time the hospital had only 100\r\n    beds, one physician, and three surgeons; it has now 650 beds, 12\r\n    physicians, and 12 surgeons, besides an array of lecturers,\r\n    dispensers, and other officers. We may regard this as a grand\r\n    day, and those who have gone through the wards of the hospital\r\n    will have found everything in good order; but I once took the\r\n    officers by surprise, and I came here in the winter, practically\r\n    without giving notice. I can assure you I found everything on\r\n    that occasion in the same condition as to-day--nurses and\r\n    attendants in their places, and surgeons and physicians\r\n    punctiliously discharging their duties.\r\n\r\n    \"I may here advert to the terrible event which occurred in the\r\n    winter--the Clerkenwell explosion. That showed how well\r\n    organized the hospital is, and how admirable its arrangements\r\n    are adapted to such an emergency. Almost immediately after the\r\n    explosion as many as 40 patients were safely housed in the\r\n    hospital, while many had their wounds dressed and were sent\r\n    away. I came here, and found that the sufferers were receiving\r\n    every possible attention. Much is, no doubt, due to the\r\n    unremitting care and supervision of the Treasurer; and if one of\r\n    the surgeons--Mr. Holden--were not present, I would express my\r\n    appreciation of his valuable services in terms which, I am sure,\r\n    many in this room would be ready to endorse. Every one is\r\n    satisfied of the thorough efficiency of the hospital; but there\r\n    is still wanting a convalescent hospital. True, there is the\r\n    Samaritan Fund, out of which you aid patients when they are\r\n    dismissed; but still, when they are nearly well, you wish to\r\n    send them into the country to recruit their health, so that they\r\n    may return to their homes thoroughly convalescent. When this\r\n    question is mooted I shall take the greatest interest, and do\r\n    all I can to promote the establishment of the additional\r\n    hospital. I have the greatest pleasure in coupling with this\r\n    toast the name of the Treasurer, and no one will more heartily\r\n    drink his health than I shall. He has been called upon to act as\r\n    Treasurer to Christ's Hospital too, and, although he will\r\n    conscientiously serve it, he will not forget his first love--St.\r\n    Bartholomew's.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Foster White, the Treasurer, in responding, said that such had been\r\nthe demand upon the resources of the hospital during the past year that\r\nits income had been exceeded by £4,000, which was owing, however,\r\nchiefly to the high price of provisions. At the time of the Clerkenwell\r\nexplosion he was prepared, if it had been necessary, to make a ward of\r\nthe dining-room, feeling sure the Governors would have supported him.\r\nThe Governors of this hospital and the Merchant Taylors' Company were in\r\ncommunication, with the object of erecting conjointly a convalescent\r\nhospital, at an expenditure of £45,000 each corporation. In conclusion,\r\nthe Treasurer denounced with some warmth the taxation of charities.\r\n\r\nThe Royal President proposed \"The Medical Staff,\" coupling the toast\r\nwith the names of Dr. Frederic Farre and Mr. Paget. To the latter he\r\ntendered his heartfelt recognition of the services he had rendered\r\nduring the severe illness of the Princess of Wales.\r\n\r\nDr. Farre and Mr. Paget having responded, the \"Corporation of London\"\r\nwas proposed from the Chair, and responded to by Mr. Alderman Finnis,\r\nand this terminated the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis 13th of May was a day of special interest in connection with\r\nMetropolitan Hospitals, the Queen having in the morning, with great\r\nstate ceremony, laid the foundation stone of the new St. Thomas's\r\nHospital, when the Prince and Princess of Wales were also present.\r\n\r\nThe informal visit paid to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, referred to by\r\nthe Prince in his speech, was on the 17th of February of that year, when\r\nhe was accompanied by the Princess of Wales. The Princess had long\r\nwished to see the Hospital, and attention was then recalled to it by the\r\nannouncement of the reception there of the sufferers from the Fenian\r\noutrage at Clerkenwell. They were conducted over the whole establishment\r\nby the Treasurer and principal surgeons. The Royal visitors had the\r\nopportunity of seeing all the Clerkenwell sufferers and of expressing\r\ntheir sympathy with them. Before leaving, they inspected the beautiful\r\nlittle church of St. Bartholomew the Less, which stands within the walls\r\nof the Hospital, and is, in fact, the Hospital chapel. The informal\r\nvisit of their Royal Highnesses, which afforded great gratification to\r\nthe authorities of the institution, lasted about an hour and a half.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe visits of the Prince to St. Bartholomew's have been frequent in\r\nsubsequent years, one interesting occasion being on the presentation of\r\na testimonial to Sir James Paget in 1871, on retiring from the post he\r\nhad long held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYING FOUNDATION STONE OF NEW BUILDINGS, GLASGOW UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n_October 8th, 1868._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever else Scotland may have to boast of, she may point with pride to\r\nher parish schools and her universities. These have contributed largely\r\nto raise her among the nations, and laid the foundation of much of the\r\nenterprise, energy, and success in life, which have long characterized\r\nthe Scots at home and abroad, and given them an honourable place in\r\nletters, science, and commerce.\r\n\r\nNext to St. Andrews, and later only by a few years, Glasgow is the\r\noldest of the Scottish Universities. It owes its origin to the Church in\r\npre-Reformation times, being founded A.D. 1450, and was at first\r\nconnected with the Cathedral. The buildings did not assume their\r\ncollegiate form till after the Reformation. The front and gateway facing\r\nthe High Street were not erected till 1660. Many still remember the\r\ndingy-looking old building, with its quaint barred windows, and\r\nprojecting balconies over the gateway, surmounted by the Royal Scottish\r\nArms, in the style and period of the last of the Stuarts. The visitor\r\npassed through the four open courts, on to the handsome modern building,\r\nthe Hunterian Museum, containing the valuable collection of Dr. William\r\nHunter, bequeathed by him in grateful remembrance of his connection with\r\nthis University.\r\n\r\nThe venerable old College, having served its purpose through successive\r\ngenerations, for more than three centuries, the Senate of the University\r\nand the citizens of Glasgow determined to provide new buildings, upon a\r\nsite and on a scale more suited to the requirements of the time.\r\nSubscriptions, in response to the appeal of the Senate, were obtained,\r\nto the amount of over £160,000; and this being supplemented by the money\r\nfor the sale of the old building and the old site, with a parliamentary\r\nvote of £120,000, gave a total of £440,000.\r\n\r\nThe site chosen for the new buildings was the rising ground called\r\nGilmore Hill, on the west of Kelvin Grove. The plans were prepared by\r\nGilbert Scott, and all the world knows how the magnificent structure in\r\ndue time rose, to be the pride and ornament of the western capital of\r\nScotland--in wealth and population the second city in the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nIt was an imposing spectacle when the Prince of Wales, accompanied by\r\nthe Princess of Wales, laid the foundation stone of the new building, on\r\nthe 8th of October, 1868. A vast concourse of people witnessed the\r\nceremony. An address was presented by the Lord Provost and Corporation,\r\nthe Prince having previously received the freedom of the city.\r\n\r\nAnother address was then presented by the Principal and Senate of the\r\nUniversity, in replying to which the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"It affords me the highest satisfaction to become a member and\r\n    graduate of your University, and at the same time to visit a\r\n    city the close connection of which with you has been so\r\n    beneficial to both, as well as to the interests of learning and\r\n    knowledge. The presence of so many of all classes of the\r\n    citizens of Glasgow around me, and their liberal subscriptions\r\n    for the prosecution of the work, the value they attach to its\r\n    completion, and their sense of the advantages they and the\r\n    people of Scotland derive from our institutions, the interest\r\n    which my lamented father took in the advancement of every branch\r\n    of science and education, would stimulate me to follow his\r\n    example, and promote by every means in my power the success of\r\n    your University and the objects for which it has been founded.\r\n    We may confidently expect that the eminent men educated here in\r\n    times past are only the precursors of a long train equally to be\r\n    distinguished by every scientific acquirement. The Princess of\r\n    Wales rejoices in the opportunity afforded her of taking part in\r\n    this day's ceremony and cordially thanks you for your kind\r\n    wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN TOUR, 1868-1869.\r\n\r\n_November 17th, 1868-May 13th, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a long break in the record of proceedings or speeches on\r\naccount of the Foreign Tour on which the Prince started in November\r\n1868, returning in May 1869. Of this time of travel it is not necessary\r\nto say much here, as the chief events and incidents are before the\r\npublic in various works. Full reports appeared in the _Times_, and other\r\njournals, during the movements of the Royal party on the Continent, in\r\nEgypt, and Palestine. Reference is made to this interesting and\r\nmemorable tour in several of the speeches made by the Prince after his\r\nreturn; and at a later time, as when he spoke at the meeting about the\r\nneglect of the Crimean graves, and at that for the memorial to Dean\r\nStanley.\r\n\r\nOnly one incident of the tour, and the one of greatest historical\r\ninterest, may be mentioned, the visit to the Cave of Machpelah and the\r\nSepulchres of the Patriarchs. In this event, not only the personal\r\ninterest, but the national importance of the Prince's Eastern Tour, may\r\nbe said to culminate. Never before had Christian pilgrims, since the\r\ndays of the Mohammedan conquest, or of the Crusades, been allowed to see\r\nso much of the holy tombs of the Patriarchs. The sanctity with which the\r\nMussulmans have invested the place is a living witness of the unbroken\r\nveneration with which men of Jewish, Christian, and Mohammedan creeds\r\nhave honoured the memory of Abraham, the father of all the faithful.\r\nHebron is known among the native population by no other name than\r\nEl-Khalil, the Friend of God.\r\n\r\nIt was the high position of the Prince of Wales, as son of Queen\r\nVictoria, that obtained for him the rare privilege of access to this\r\nsacred spot. Nor was it obtained for him without some difficulty. Mr.\r\nFinn, the English Consul at Jerusalem, prepared the way by requesting an\r\norder from the Porte; and the reply of the Grand Vizier left the matter\r\nvery much to the discretion of the Governor, the Pasha of Jerusalem. He\r\ngave his consent on the condition that only a small number should\r\naccompany the Prince; and precautions were taken that the experiment\r\nshould be made with as little risk as possible. The approach to Hebron\r\nwas lined with troops, and guards were posted on the house-tops, in case\r\nof any outbreak of fanatical opposition to entering the holy places. A\r\nguard attended the Prince up to the entrance of the sacred enclosure.\r\nEven then two of the Arab Sheiks were inclined to give annoyance, but\r\nthese the Governor of Hebron ordered out, or rather escorted them out\r\nhimself, and the remainder were very courteous and complimentary to the\r\nPrince, saying that they were glad to have the opportunity of showing\r\nany civility in their power to one of the Princes of England, to whom\r\ntheir Government and people were so much indebted for kind offices.\r\n\r\nDr. Rosen, well known to travellers in Palestine for his knowledge of\r\nsacred geography, was fortunately one of the party admitted, and he was\r\nable to make a ground plan of the platform. This, with the observations\r\nrecorded by another of the Prince's party, has given clearer knowledge\r\nof this world-renowned spot. The existence and exact situation of the\r\ncave, the views of the enclosure within and without, the relation of the\r\ndifferent tombs to each other, and the general conformity of the\r\ntraditions of the mosque to the accounts of the Bible, and of the early\r\ntravellers, were now, for the first time, clearly ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe Prince's visit was on the 7th of April, 1869. The story of the visit\r\nspread throughout the lands of Islam; and therefore this one incident of\r\nthe Prince's Eastern Tour is here referred to as showing its national\r\nimportance, and that the prestige of England is still great in these\r\nlands. But we must resume the record of speeches in England, where it so\r\nhappens that the first of consequence was made at a meeting of the Royal\r\nGeographical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n_May 24th, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the \"learned societies\" in London, the Royal Geographical is the\r\nmost popular. Perhaps it is because there is less \"book learning\"\r\nrequired for its membership, than that love of travel, enterprise, and\r\nadventure, which characterizes all true Englishmen. Professor Owen once\r\nsaid that in the new Hall of the Geographical Society a statue of\r\n'Robinson Crusoe' should be the central figure. It was a wise and\r\nsuggestive, though humorous proposal, for few geographers have not\r\nreceived early impressions from Defoe's immortal book. The whole globe\r\nis embraced in the objects of the Society, whether in the Old World or\r\nthe New, whether the explorations are in the frozen regions of the Pole,\r\nor in the deserts and forests of tropical Africa.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary meeting of the Society was held on the 24th of May,\r\n1869, in the Royal Institution, under the Presidency of Sir Roderick\r\nMurchison, to whose energy and enthusiasm geographical discoveries, and\r\nthe prosperity of the Society, have been so largely due.\r\n\r\nWhen the health of the Prince of Wales, as their Royal vice-patron was\r\ngiven, the President referred to the appointment of Sir Samuel Baker,\r\nthe Society's medallist of the year, to the government of Equatorial\r\nAfrica. The good-will and patronage of the Viceroy in this instance was\r\nessentially obtained through the personal influence of the Prince of\r\nWales. Among the guests at their table was the young Egyptian Prince\r\nHassan.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Roderick Murchison, your Highness, my Lords, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--Under any ordinary circumstances it would have given\r\n    me great pleasure to be present at this interesting meeting--the\r\n    anniversary dinner of the Royal Geographical Society; but I feel\r\n    doubly proud to be here this evening as a vice-patron of so\r\n    useful and celebrated an institution. Sir Roderick Murchison has\r\n    had the kindness to allude to me as a traveller; I can only say\r\n    that I feel ashamed almost to stand here with the name of a\r\n    traveller, when I see around me so many distinguished persons\r\n    who have travelled, I may almost say from one end of the world\r\n    to the other. But I cannot be too grateful that my lamented\r\n    father at an early period gave me an opportunity of travelling\r\n    and seeing foreign countries; and the same permission being\r\n    granted to my brother, I feel certain that we have both derived\r\n    great benefit from seeing those interesting countries which it\r\n    has been our happiness to visit. No doubt much knowledge and\r\n    learning may be obtained by reading books of foreign travel, but\r\n    I feel convinced that all those gentlemen who are members of\r\n    this society will coincide with me when I say that you cannot\r\n    form so full or favourable an idea of the countries described by\r\n    reading of them in books as you can by visiting them yourselves.\r\n\r\n    \"I am greatly flattered and deeply sensible of the kind manner\r\n    in which Sir Roderick Murchison has mentioned me in connexion\r\n    with the name of one whose presence we must all very much miss\r\n    this evening--I mean my late travelling companion, Sir Samuel\r\n    Baker. I cannot but regret that he was forced to leave this\r\n    country rather suddenly in order to make arrangements for his\r\n    great and important undertaking, and could not, indeed, take\r\n    farewell of all his friends. Sir Roderick has stated that I was\r\n    in some way instrumental in helping Sir Samuel Baker to carry\r\n    out the enterprise in which he is engaged. His Highness the\r\n    Viceroy of Egypt, I know, has deeply at heart the great\r\n    importance of that noble enterprise--to put down slavery on the\r\n    White Nile, and I need hardly tell you that anything I could do\r\n    in the matter was done with the utmost pleasure and\r\n    satisfaction. Such an enterprise must meet the approval not only\r\n    of every Englishman, but of every philanthropist. There are\r\n    great difficulties connected with it. These difficulties must be\r\n    great to any one, and they must still be more trying to a\r\n    European; but I know Sir Samuel Baker to be a man of energy and\r\n    perseverance, and whatever the difficulties he may have to\r\n    encounter he is certain, if it lies in his power, to attain the\r\n    end of his mission.\"\r\n\r\nWe may here say that when Sir Samuel Baker gave a detailed account of\r\nhis experiences, in the Hall of the London University, the Prince moved\r\nthe vote of thanks, in a speech equally eulogistic.\r\n\r\nThe Prince again rose after the toast of \"The Army and Navy, and\r\nAuxiliary Forces,\" had been given. He apologised for responding for the\r\nArmy, in presence of so many distinguished officers: but he spoke by\r\ncommand of the President, and a soldier's first duty is obedience.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Sir George Back, the veteran Arctic explorer, and a leading\r\nofficer in the Society, returned thanks for \"The Navy.\"\r\n\r\nThe President next proposed the health of Professor Nordenskiold, of\r\nStockholm, and of Mrs. Mary Somerville. The former received \"the\r\nFounder's\" Medal, for his Arctic discoveries; and to Mrs. Somerville,\r\nthen in her eighty-ninth year, had been awarded the Patron or Victoria\r\nMedal, for her scientific and astronomical researches, and her works on\r\nphysical geography.\r\n\r\nSir Roderick then proposed the health of Professor Owen, and the Duke of\r\nSutherland, and Dr. Russell, who had been companions of the Prince in\r\nhis Egyptian journey. Dr. Russell had, through the _Times_, been the\r\nreporter and historian of the expedition. The speech of Professor Owen\r\nwas in happiest vein. Indeed, the whole of the speeches of the meeting,\r\nincluding those of Sir Francis Grant, the Duke of Sutherland, Dr.\r\nRussell, and Sir Henry Rawlinson, who proposed the health of the\r\nPresident, made this a memorable anniversary of the Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLSWOOD ASYLUM.\r\n\r\n_June 28th, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nAll travellers on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, have\r\nadmired the palatial and splendidly situated building near Red Hill,\r\nSurrey, known as the Earlswood Asylum. It is an institution for the care\r\nand education of the idiot and imbecile. Everything that can be done by\r\nkindness and skill to ameliorate the lot of these classes, is here in\r\nexercise. By far the larger number show some capability of improvement,\r\nand not a few have learned some trade or industry, sufficient for their\r\nown support. There are now nearly 600 inmates, from all parts of the\r\nkingdom. At each half yearly election, there are about 150 applicants of\r\nwhom the Board usually can elect 30 to 35. The receipts of last year\r\nwere nearly £25,000, and the charity has £20,000 invested funds.\r\n\r\nThe first stone of the Asylum was laid by the Prince Consort in 1853,\r\nand the building was opened by him in 1855. To lay the first stone of\r\nadditional buildings, on part of the 80 acres belonging to the Asylum,\r\nthe presence of the Prince of Wales was asked, and was very cordially\r\ngiven. Accompanied by the Princess of Wales, he went to Earlswood for\r\nthis purpose on the 28th of June, 1869. The Mayor and the magistrates of\r\nReigate came to the Earlswood railway station with an address of\r\nwelcome, to which the Prince made reply.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Reed, son of the Rev. Dr. Andrew Reed, founder of the\r\nInstitution (as he was of other important charities), conducted the\r\nRoyal visitors to the gate of the Asylum, to which they had driven from\r\nthe station. From the Board Room a procession was formed, to the place\r\nof laying the stone. Here another address was read, in reply to which\r\nthe Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--I thank you for the kind expressions\r\n    contained in your address. I cannot but rejoice that my presence\r\n    should be considered an encouragement, and conducive to the\r\n    prosperity of an institution that lays claim to our warmest\r\n    support. Apart from all other considerations, the fact of my\r\n    lamented father having taken so active a part in the early\r\n    formation of the society would, in itself, be sufficient to\r\n    enlist my sympathy and interest in its welfare. The necessity\r\n    for affording more extended accommodation, in consequence of the\r\n    increased number of applicants, is the best proof of the success\r\n    which has followed your first efforts. We must all appreciate\r\n    the comprehensive principle which regulates, without regard to\r\n    social or religious distinction, the admission of all classes of\r\n    our fellow-creatures suffering under an affliction which reduces\r\n    them to one common level. Finally, I have to assure you,\r\n    gentlemen, how sincerely I feel your expressions of devotion and\r\n    attachment towards the Queen, the Princess of Wales, and the\r\n    Royal family. I am persuaded they, equally with myself, will\r\n    watch with increasing interest the success of an institution\r\n    this day enlarged under such hopeful circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nThe Treasurer then handed to the Prince a silver trowel, and Sir Charles\r\nReed, M.P., presented the mallet, which had been used by the Prince\r\nConsort on laying the first stone of the \"Infant Orphan Asylum\" at\r\nWanstead, and which His Royal Highness had afterwards given to Dr.\r\nAndrew Reed. A good supply of mortar having been brought to the Prince\r\nof Wales in a mahogany hod, His Royal Highness spread a sufficient\r\nquantity to make a setting for the stone. Then, amid cheering, the stone\r\nwas slowly lowered, and the Prince tapped it with the mallet, tested it\r\nby rule and plumb, and amid a flourish of trumpets, followed by the\r\nNational Anthem, pronounced it to be well and truly fixed. The\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury then offered an appropriate prayer, which was\r\nfollowed by a hymn, of which there was an instrumental performance by\r\nthe hand of the Grenadier Guards, while the words were sung by the\r\nentire company.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess then took their seats, and, to the March of King\r\nChristian IX., of Denmark, there was an interesting and, for the\r\ncharity, a most gratifying procession. It was one of ladies, who to the\r\nnumber of 380 in single file ascended the daïs where the Prince sat, and\r\ndeposited in all 400 purses. The Prince had previously, immediately\r\nafter fixing the stone, handed to the Treasurer, a check for a hundred\r\nguineas. A _déjeuner_ followed, and planting of memorial trees and other\r\nfestivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALEXANDRA DOCK AT LYNN.\r\n\r\n_July 7th, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nSix centuries ago Lynn was, next to London, the chief port on the east\r\ncoast. It is nearer than any other port to Holland and North Germany. In\r\ncourse of time the foreign trade of the place had fallen into decay, and\r\nthe town itself was outstripped in business by Hull, Grimsby, Yarmouth,\r\nand other eastern seaports. A time of revival having come, it was\r\nconsidered that the prosperity of the ancient borough would be secured\r\nby the formation of docks and accommodation for foreign trade, as the\r\nmanufacturing districts of the Midland Counties might be brought into\r\nconnection with Lynn as the shortest route to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the\r\nTexel, and Hamburg. In hope of benefiting the trade and industry of the\r\ntown, the Lynn Dock Company was formed, and obtained from Mr. Brunlees,\r\nC.E., the plans for a great dock, which in due time was completed, and\r\nwas inaugurated by the Prince and Princess of Wales, on the 7th of July,\r\n1869.\r\n\r\nArriving from London, by special train of the Great Eastern Railway, the\r\nRoyal visitors were received, with great ceremony, in the Council Room\r\nof the Town Hall of Lynn. An address was presented by the Recorder, in\r\nwhich gratification was expressed at their Royal Highnesses having\r\nselected an abode in the neighbourhood of the borough, and in showing\r\ntheir interest in its welfare by having graciously undertaken to\r\ninaugurate their new dock.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness made the following reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--I thank you for this address, for the\r\n    loyalty and attachment you express towards the Queen, and for\r\n    the kind welcome you offer the Princess and myself. It is\r\n    peculiarly gratifying to us to visit you on an occasion like the\r\n    present. The revolutions of time and science would have had the\r\n    same effects upon King's Lynn as upon other commercial ports but\r\n    for the energies of the inhabitants. Without them its ancient\r\n    name would have become interesting only for its antiquity. But\r\n    in the century in which we live it is permitted neither to town\r\n    nor to community to rest quiet or to stand still. The energies I\r\n    have referred to, I have learned to appreciate from living in\r\n    your neighbourhood, and, indeed, I have been called on to\r\n    participate in them as regards the navigation of your waters. I\r\n    fervently pray that the Dock we are about to open this day, may,\r\n    under the fostering auspices of a beneficent Providence, open\r\n    out new sources of wealth and commerce, shedding the blessings\r\n    which are derived from them on your town, and contributing to\r\n    the prosperity of our beloved country.\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal party then visited the Grammar School, where the Prince\r\nreceived and responded to an address from the Masters and Scholars, and\r\npresented to the successful competitor the gold medal, given annually,\r\nthrough the munificence of the Prince, as a prize for classical and\r\nmodern languages in alternate years. The Prince presented the prize,\r\nsaying:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have great pleasure in presenting you with this medal. On a\r\n    former occasion I presented it at Sandringham, but it is more\r\n    pleasure to you to receive it among your schoolfellows. I hope\r\n    this medal will contribute to your success in future life, and\r\n    that it may be a stimulus to you for further exertion.\"\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the Dock, the circumference of which was densely crowded,\r\nthe Royal visitors were greeted with cheering, bell-ringing, and every\r\ndemonstration of welcome. When it came to the ceremony of declaring the\r\ndock open, an agreeable surprise was added by the terms in which the\r\nannouncement was made:--\r\n\r\n    I DECLARE THIS DOCK NOW OPEN, AND THAT HENCEFORTH IT IS TO BE\r\n    CALLED THE ALEXANDRA DOCK.\r\n\r\nThe announcement was received with vociferous acclamation. The Prince's\r\nintention had been signified to the Chairman of the Dock Company only a\r\nfew minutes before, and was quite unknown to the mass of the spectators,\r\nwho expressed their delight by repeated salvos of cheering.\r\n\r\nAt a banquet afterwards given, when the toast of the Royal visitors was\r\ngiven, by Mr. Jarvis the President, the Prince said that he regarded\r\nKing's Lynn as his country town, and should always feel the deepest\r\ninterest in its welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO MANCHESTER.\r\n\r\n_July, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual show of the Royal Agricultural Society was held in 1869 at\r\nManchester, which the Prince of Wales visited on the 29th of July,\r\naccompanied by the Princess of Wales.\r\n\r\nThere are some who remember the first visit of the Queen and Prince\r\nConsort to Manchester in 1851. The Royal party then proceeded along the\r\ncanal to Worsley from Patricroft, where the wonderful engineering works\r\nof James Nasmyth were inspected. In 1869, the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales were conducted along the same canal, but in reverse direction, the\r\nbarge going from Worsley, through Patricroft, to Old Trafford. The\r\nPrince and Princess, with their host and hostess, the Earl and Countess\r\nof Ellesmere, drove from the Hall to the stage where the royal barge was\r\nwaiting. A large flotilla of boats followed as a guard of honour,\r\nincluding some of the Manchester Rowing Clubs. It was a strange and\r\npicturesque canal scene, the barges being towed by horses ridden by\r\npostillions, and the towing path all along the route, for five or six\r\nmiles, being kept clear by mounted patrols in livery. It was a great\r\ngala day in those densely peopled regions.\r\n\r\nIn passing through Salford an address was presented by the Mayor,\r\nAldermen, and burgesses of that borough, in the Reading Room of the\r\nRoyal Museum. The address expressed the great pleasure experienced by\r\nthis, the second visit of the Prince to their town, enhanced by the\r\npresence there, for the first time, of the Princess of Wales: \"We\r\ncherish a lively and affectionate remembrance of the visit of Her Most\r\nGracious Majesty the Queen to Peel-park in the year 1851, when she\r\nwitnessed the assemblage of 80,000 Sunday-school scholars, and listened,\r\nnot unmoved, while they sang the National Anthem. This event was\r\ncommemorated by the erection of a marble statue to Her Majesty in the\r\npark, which was publicly inaugurated by the late and much revered Prince\r\nConsort, who on that occasion inspected and manifested a deep interest\r\nin the free museum and library in the park. We deeply deplored the loss\r\nof the late Prince Consort, and erected a marble statue to his memory,\r\nin close proximity to that of the Queen, and near the spot where he\r\nstood when inaugurating the statue of Her Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince made the following reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--The Princess of Wales and myself\r\n    thank you very cordially for your address, and for the\r\n    sentiments you are good enough to express towards us. It is very\r\n    gratifying to us to have the opportunity of paying you a visit,\r\n    and to observe the evidences of the growing wealth and\r\n    population which have raised Salford to the position she now\r\n    occupies in the Empire. It will be highly satisfactory to the\r\n    Queen to learn how deeply engraven on your hearts is the\r\n    recollection of the visit she paid you in 1851, and how\r\n    cherished and beloved is the memory of my lamented father. On my\r\n    own part, I can but acknowledge the kindness of the terms in\r\n    which you have alluded to my past years. For those which are to\r\n    come I can only say that it will be the one effort of my life\r\n    to merit the good opinion of the people I am so proud to call my\r\n    fellow-countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nIn driving through the park the Royal visitors had been conducted past\r\nthe white marble statues of the Queen and the Prince Consort, and those\r\nof Richard Cobden and Joseph Brotherton. Leaving the park, the streets\r\nand ways being everywhere densely thronged, they reached the Manchester\r\nTown Hall, where another address was delivered, expressing joyous\r\nwelcome from the loyal citizens, and especially the feelings of\r\nsatisfaction at the presence of the Prince, as President of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society, \"believing the same to be an evidence of the deep\r\ninterest manifested by your Royal Highness in the success of all\r\nmovements which have for their object the advancement of art and science\r\nand the progress and welfare of the people of this great empire. It has\r\nbeen the special privilege of your Royal Highness to an unusual extent\r\nto visit and personally to become acquainted with other Courts and\r\ncountries, and with distant portions of Her Majesty's dominions, and we\r\nrejoice to believe that the valuable experience thereby acquired gives\r\nto all classes of Her Majesty's subjects an assurance that your Royal\r\nHighness will ever be foremost in all efforts to extend true liberty and\r\ncivilization, and to develope those free institutions which are the\r\npride and glory of our country.\"\r\n\r\nTo which address the Prince replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--I thank you for the kind expressions\r\n    of loyalty and devotion towards the Queen, the Princess of\r\n    Wales, and myself contained in your address. I have gladly\r\n    availed myself of the opportunity afforded me, in the fulfilment\r\n    of my duties as President of the Royal Agricultural Society, to\r\n    visit a city second to none in the Empire in commercial\r\n    importance, to become better acquainted with its history, its\r\n    locality, and the sources of its prosperity. The wise provision\r\n    of my lamented father and of the Queen, my dear mother, has\r\n    secured for me at an early age the advantages of visiting the\r\n    centres of the world, the most remarkable and the most deserving\r\n    of study for their interest and for their development of the\r\n    elements of wealth. In admiring, and, I trust, appreciating, the\r\n    successful result that has distinguished foreign exertions, I\r\n    have also learnt to look with increased admiration on those\r\n    wonderful works of human ingenuity, perseverance, and industry,\r\n    the products of the heads and hands of my own countrymen, and\r\n    especially of those who now surround me. May we all be grateful,\r\n    gentlemen, to a superintending Providence, which has blessed\r\n    the efforts of our commercial enterprise and the free\r\n    institutions of our country,--themselves a pledge of our future\r\n    prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince presided at a general meeting of the Council of the Society,\r\nand opened the proceedings by a brief speech which was loudly applauded.\r\nHe also received in his own marquee a numerous deputation from the\r\nAgricultural Society of France. At the close of the meeting the Royal\r\nvisitors drove to a station on the Manchester South Junction line, where\r\na train was waiting to take them to Brough, near Hull, viâ Normanton;\r\nthe Prince having engaged to be at Hull in the afternoon in order to\r\ninaugurate the new Western Dock at that town.\r\n\r\nThe principal object of the Prince's visit was to see the Royal\r\nAgricultural Show, the members mustering in great force for the occasion\r\nfrom all parts of England. At the midday luncheon the Chairman, the Earl\r\nof Sefton, gave the toast of \"The Queen,\" who was deeply interested in\r\nthe agricultural affairs of the Kingdom, and set the practical example\r\nof being an exhibitor at the present Show. The Chairman next proposed\r\n\"The Health of their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales.\"\r\nHe said the present toast should be the last. He had to ask them to\r\ndrink to the health of the President of the Royal Agricultural Society\r\nof England, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, coupled with the\r\ntoast of Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales. He had looked forward\r\nto this meeting for a long time, and it was with the greatest pride they\r\nlearnt that it was to be held under the presidency of His Royal\r\nHighness. The reception their Royal Highnesses met with the day previous\r\nand that day sufficiently testified to the loyalty and attachment of the\r\npeople of this country to the Crown. It was difficult to allude to the\r\ngood qualities of His Royal Highness, but he was ever foremost in the\r\nfurtherance of works of charity and usefulness. They also experienced\r\nthe warmest attachment and the truest loyalty towards the Princess.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, in replying, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the kind way in\r\n    which you have received this toast. My health has been proposed\r\n    twofold--first for myself, and also in my position as President\r\n    of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. I can assure you\r\n    it was great honour that was conferred upon me when I was asked\r\n    to assume this presidency, and my only regret is that this\r\n    office has been a mere nominal one, and that I have not been\r\n    able to be of so much use as I should have liked. At the same\r\n    time I feel a pride in being President of a Society which has\r\n    existed for so long, and which is one of the greatest\r\n    agricultural societies anywhere, always helping forward\r\n    improvements in agriculture. It was a great satisfaction to this\r\n    Society to hold one of its annual meetings at Manchester, one of\r\n    the greatest manufacturing towns of England. It is my duty as\r\n    President of the Society to return, in the name of the Society,\r\n    our most cordial and our warmest thanks for the extensive and\r\n    liberal way in which the local committee have made their\r\n    arrangements. It is to them we owe this magnificent\r\n    entertainment in this fine tent, and also the excellent\r\n    arrangements which we see before us. Lord Sefton told us not to\r\n    make many speeches or long ones. I will, therefore, not make any\r\n    further remarks, but, before sitting down, allow me to thank you\r\n    in the name of the Princess for the kind way in which you have\r\n    received her. I can assure you it has given her great pleasure\r\n    to be present at this second visit to the Royal Agricultural\r\n    Society, and this her first visit to Manchester. We both feel\r\n    deeply grateful for the kind and hearty welcome which we have\r\n    received, not only from Manchester, but from the inhabitants of\r\n    Lancashire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEABODY MEMORIAL. UNVEILING OF THE STATUE IN THE CITY OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n_July 23rd, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best memorials of George Peabody, American citizen and\r\nphilanthropist, are the piles of buildings which stand as monuments of\r\nhis generous liberality, and of his desire to advance the physical and\r\nmoral welfare of the poor of London. He received from the Queen of\r\nEngland, and from many public and official bodies, warm recognition of\r\nhis beneficence. But it was also fitting and right that in some public\r\nplace a Statue should be erected, to perpetuate his name and his\r\nlikeness, as well as to commemorate his good deeds. The citizens of\r\nLondon, headed by all the leading men of the Metropolis, subscribed for\r\nthe Statue, which now adorns the site on the east of the Royal Exchange.\r\nThe Prince of Wales, having consented to perform the ceremony of\r\nunveiling the Statue, was received at the Mansion House by the Lord\r\nMayor, where a distinguished company had assembled. In response to the\r\ntoast of his health, the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you for the compliment you have paid me in drinking my\r\n    health. I assure you it is always a pleasure to me to be present\r\n    here at the Mansion-house. It is not, indeed, the first time I\r\n    have received the hospitality of the Lord Mayor and of the City\r\n    of London. We are assembled to take part in a great ceremony,\r\n    and I accepted with much pleasure the invitation and the\r\n    privilege of unveiling the statue of Mr. George Peabody. After\r\n    the appropriate remarks the Lord Mayor has made concerning him I\r\n    have little to say except to indorse what has been so well\r\n    expressed by his Lordship. He is a man whose name will go down\r\n    to posterity as a great philanthropist, and you, my Lord Mayor,\r\n    and the citizens of London in particular, can never be\r\n    sufficiently grateful to him for what he has done.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the luncheon His Royal Highness was escorted to the site of the\r\nmemorial. Here Sir Benjamin Phillips, Chairman of the Committee,\r\naddressed the Prince, concluding with these words:--\"Let us hope that\r\nthis statue, erected by the sons of free England to the honour of one of\r\nColumbia's truest and noblest citizens, may be symbolical of the peace\r\nand goodwill that exist between the two countries, and that a people\r\nspringing from the same stock, speaking the same language, and inspired\r\nand animated by the same love of freedom and progress may live in\r\nuninterrupted friendship and happiness. Your Royal Highness may remember\r\nthe language so beautifully expressed by George Peabody, in the letter\r\nthat accompanied his last noble gift, when, speaking of America he said,\r\n'I will pray that Almighty God will give to it a future as happy and\r\nnoble in the intelligence and virtue of its citizens as it will be\r\nglorious in unexampled power and prosperity.' Your Royal Highness, these\r\nare the sentiments uttered by a man of ripe age, and alike applicable to\r\nthe land of his birth and to the country of his adoption. May they\r\ninspire us, may they animate us, and may they find an echo throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of our own free and happy homes.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales than presented himself to speak,\r\nand was hailed with enthusiastic cheers. He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Benjamin Phillips, my Lord Mayor, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--I\r\n    feel sure that all those who have heard the words which have\r\n    just been uttered cannot but be gratified with what has been\r\n    said. Allow me to say to you that among the many duties which I\r\n    have to perform, and which I have the privilege of performing,\r\n    none could have given me greater pleasure than to assist and\r\n    take part in the unveiling of this statue on this occasion. The\r\n    name of George Peabody is so well known to all of you that\r\n    really I feel some difficulty in saying anything new of that\r\n    remarkable man; but, at the same time, it affords me the deepest\r\n    gratification to join in paying a mark of tribute and respect to\r\n    the name of that great American citizen and philanthropist--I\r\n    may say, that citizen of the world. England can never adequately\r\n    pay the debt of gratitude which she owes to him--London\r\n    especially, where his wonderful charity has been so liberally\r\n    distributed. For a man not born in this country to give a sum, I\r\n    believe, more than a quarter of a million of pounds sterling for\r\n    purposes of benevolence is a fact unexampled. His name will go\r\n    down to posterity as one who, as Sir Benjamin Phillips so justly\r\n    remarked, has tried to ameliorate the condition of his poorer\r\n    fellow-citizens, and especially to benefit their moral and\r\n    social character. I have not yet had the opportunity of seeing\r\n    the statue which is about to be unveiled, but having had the\r\n    privilege of knowing the sculptor, Mr. Story, for a space of now\r\n    about ten years, I feel sure it will be one worthy of his\r\n    reputation, and worthy also of the man to whom it is dedicated.\r\n    Before concluding the few imperfect remarks which I have\r\n    ventured to address to you, let me thank Mr. Motley, the\r\n    American Minister, for his presence on this occasion, and assure\r\n    him what pleasure it gives me to take part in this great and I\r\n    might almost say, national ceremonial of paying a tribute to the\r\n    name of his great and distinguished countryman. Be assured that\r\n    the feelings which I personally entertain towards America are\r\n    the same as they ever were. I can never forget the reception\r\n    which I had there nine years ago, and my earnest wish and hope\r\n    is that England and America may go hand in hand in peace and\r\n    prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of His Royal Highness's address the Statue was\r\nuncovered, and at a signal from the Lord Mayor a loud and prolonged\r\ncheer was raised on its being exposed to view.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, the American Minister, then addressed the vast audience.\r\nHe said, towards the close of his speech, \"It is a delightful thought\r\nthat the tens of thousands who daily throng this crowded mart will see\r\nhim almost as accurately as if in the flesh, and that generations after\r\ngenerations--that long, yet unborn, but I fear, never ending procession\r\nof London's poor--will be almost as familiar in the future with the form\r\nand features of their great benefactor as are those of us who have\r\nenjoyed his acquaintance and friendship in life.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Story, the sculptor, having been called on, said he had no speech to\r\nmake. He added, significantly pointing to the Statue, \"That is my\r\nspeech,\"--a remark which occasioned much merriment and cheering.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was then brought to a close, and the Prince took his leave.\r\nHis Royal Highness, as he did so, was repeatedly cheered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTTISH HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n_November 30th, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Corporation is commonly called the Scottish Hospital, but\r\nthis is rather misleading as to the uses of the charity. Its objects are\r\nto assist, by pensions, poor aged natives of Scotland living in London,\r\nto afford temporary relief to Scotchmen in distress, or to aid them to\r\nreturn to their own country; and also to educate poor Scottish children.\r\nThe last-named object is also carried out by a kindred institution, the\r\nRoyal Caledonian Asylum, which receives some children of indigent\r\nScotchmen in London, although its main purpose is the maintenance and\r\neducation of children of soldiers, sailors, and marines, natives of\r\nCaledonia. The Scottish Hospital possesses funded property to the amount\r\nof £40,000, and the annual receipts are about £5000. In trust to the\r\nScottish Hospital there is also attached the \"Kinloch Bequest,\" for\r\ngranting pensions to Scottish soldiers and sailors, resident in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, who have been wounded or have lost their sight in the\r\nservice of the country, and whose incomes do not exceed £20 from other\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary festival of the Scottish Corporation is always held on\r\nthe 30th of November, St. Andrew's day. In 1869 His Royal Highness the\r\nPrince of Wales presided at the dinner. The guests at this festival are\r\nmostly Scottish, and a large muster of Highland Chiefs and Lowland\r\nLairds, as well as prosperous Scotchmen of London, supported the Royal\r\nchairman upon this occasion. Prince Christian and other distinguished\r\nvisitors were also present. Many of the stewards wore the garb of old\r\nGaul, and the tartans, scarves, flags, and decorations made the Hall of\r\nthe Freemasons' Tavern assume a national appearance. The \"bagpipes\" were\r\nalso in honourable use, the Prince being conducted to the chair to the\r\ntune of the Highland laddie, played by the Queen's piper, the Prince's\r\nfirst piper, and the piper of the Royal Caledonian Asylum. The Prince\r\nhad previously been received by a guard of honour of the London\r\nArtillery, whose band played the National Anthem, while the band of the\r\nLondon Scottish Volunteers performed a selection of Scotch music during\r\nthe dinner. The three pipers also, at intervals, paraded the hall, and\r\nregaled the guests with their stirring strains.\r\n\r\nThe health of the Queen was drunk with enthusiasm, specially as the\r\npatroness of the Scottish Hospital. To the toast of \"the Princess of\r\nWales and the rest of the Royal Family,\" proposed by the Duke of\r\nRoxburghe, the Prince responded, and then gave: \"The Army, Navy,\r\nMilitia, and Volunteers,\" referring in his speech to the Kinloch\r\nBequest, which provides pensions for about 400 disabled soldiers and\r\nsailors. A Scotch vocalist, Mr. Maclagan, sang \"Scots wha hae wi'\r\nWallace bled.\" Then the Prince rose to give the toast of \"Prosperity to\r\nthe Scottish Hospital\":--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highness, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I have now to\r\n    give you the toast of the evening: 'Prosperity to the Scottish\r\n    Hospital.' I feel assured that it is a toast which the numerous\r\n    assembly I see before me will drink in bumpers. As you know, the\r\n    Queen is patroness of this hospital; she has been so for\r\n    thirty-seven years, and she has contributed to its funds between\r\n    £3000 and £4000. At twenty different anniversaries the late King\r\n    William, as Duke of Clarence, presided. The Duke of Kent, the\r\n    Duke of Sussex, and the Duke of Cambridge also presided at\r\n    various anniversaries, and contributed largely to the funds of\r\n    the hospital.\r\n\r\n    \"The hospital, as no doubt most of you know, was originally\r\n    founded in the reign of James I. Its first charter was given to\r\n    it by Charles II., in 1665, and a second charter of\r\n    incorporation was granted by the same Monarch, in 1676,\r\n    containing more extended privileges. It became necessary,\r\n    however, to enable the corporation to extend its relief, to\r\n    obtain a new charter, which was granted by King George I., in\r\n    1715.\r\n\r\n    \"By the paper which has been placed in my hands I observe the\r\n    pensions which are contributed by this ancient corporation are\r\n    very numerous. I see that a sum is set apart for the support of\r\n    five persons exceeding 65 years of age who have occupied a\r\n    respectable social position, and who have a permanent income of\r\n    not less than £15, but not more than £30 per annum; for 20 poor\r\n    and infirm persons exceeding 72 years of age, to whom a pension\r\n    of £15 each per annum is allowed; for 110 above 68, to whom a\r\n    pension of £12 each is allowed. Pensions of £6 are granted to 50\r\n    persons selected from the casual list. Monthly casual relief to\r\n    upwards of 200 is awarded by the committee, and free passages to\r\n    Scotland are given to such as require them.\r\n\r\n    \"The charity of the Scottish Hospital is applicable to the poor\r\n    natives of Scotland and their children resident in the\r\n    Metropolis and its immediate neighbourhood, who, not being in\r\n    receipt of parochial relief in this country, would in age and\r\n    poverty, in sickness or distress, or when in want of employment,\r\n    be exposed to the utmost wretchedness, or to discreditable\r\n    beggary, but for the fostering relief afforded them by this\r\n    institution. Those natives of Scotland resident in London who\r\n    may desire to spend the remainder of their days in Scotland have\r\n    free passages granted to them by the corporation. From the\r\n    accumulation of a subscription which was raised in India thirty\r\n    years ago the corporation is also enabled to allot £120 a year\r\n    to the ministers and Kirk Sessions of the several congregations\r\n    of the Scottish churches in London and Westminster, for the\r\n    purpose of affording education to the children of Scottish\r\n    parents at the schools attached to these churches.\r\n\r\n    \"I am happy to say that the Scottish Hospital is in a more\r\n    prosperous state this year than at any former period. But at the\r\n    same time further demands have been made upon its funds. The\r\n    claims during the past year have been in excess of any previous\r\n    year, and several of the cases relieved have been of a very\r\n    pressing and urgent nature. Pensions of £6, £12, £15, and £25\r\n    per annum have been granted to nearly 200 respectable men and\r\n    women, whose means of support have been greatly increased by the\r\n    timely aid afforded. Nearly 300 monthly applicants have had sums\r\n    given to them by the directors, in several instances amounting\r\n    to £5 at one time. In addition to these, more than 1300 persons\r\n    have had casual assistance at the office of the corporation.\r\n    Passages to Scotland have been granted to about 200 deserving\r\n    persons. But for the intervention of this corporation many would\r\n    have been compelled to apply to an English parish for relief,\r\n    and by doing so would have lost that feeling of independence\r\n    which every Scotsman cherishes and desires to maintain. Upwards\r\n    of 208 children of Scottish parents resident in the Metropolis\r\n    have during the year been educated at the expense of the\r\n    corporation. Soldiers and sailors, natives of Scotland, to the\r\n    number of nearly 400, have been in receipt of pensions from the\r\n    Kinloch Bequest.\r\n\r\n    \"Although the facts must be known to most of you, I have\r\n    nevertheless thought it necessary to mention a few of them in\r\n    order to stimulate your generosity this evening, and induce you\r\n    to contribute as largely as you can for the benefit of this\r\n    excellent charity. I hope you will drink the toast of\r\n    'Prosperity to the Scottish Hospital' in full bumpers. I have\r\n    great pleasure in coupling with the toast the name of the noble\r\n    Duke on my left, who has been president for four successive\r\n    years.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Roxburghe, in responding to the toast, announced that His\r\nRoyal Highness had kindly consented to allow his name to appear as that\r\nof President of the Corporation for the ensuing year. As Duke of\r\nRothesay he had a warm welcome that evening, and in the name of his\r\nbrother Scotchmen he gave his heartfelt thanks for appearing among them.\r\n\"Nay more, I thank him in the name of the aged recipients of this great\r\ncharity, many of whom have seen better days, but who now, bowed down by\r\npoverty, look to you for assistance in the hour of need. I also thank\r\nHis Royal Highness in the name of all whose sorrows have been lessened,\r\nand whose homes have been brightened, by the ministrations of this\r\nSociety.\" He proposed the health of the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with \"Highland honours.\" His Royal Highness, who was\r\nloudly cheered, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highness, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--Allow me to\r\n    return you my most hearty thanks for the excessively kind way in\r\n    which my health leas been proposed and received by you. On any\r\n    ordinary occasion I should have been deeply gratified by the\r\n    kind feeling displayed towards me, but I am deeply touched by\r\n    the enthusiasm you have manifested just now in drinking my\r\n    health with Highland honours. I can only say it has afforded me\r\n    great pleasure to preside here this evening. Although for some\r\n    years past the Duke of Roxburghe asked me to take the chair,\r\n    different circumstances unfortunately prevented me--being absent\r\n    from the country two years ago--- and again last year being on\r\n    the Continent. I feel, therefore, exceedingly happy that I have\r\n    been enabled to be present this evening, and to discharge what I\r\n    have found to be the very easy duties of chairman. My lords and\r\n    gentlemen, let me thank you once more for the honour you have\r\n    done me in drinking my health, and for the support you have\r\n    given me this evening.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness then announced that telegrams had been received\r\nduring the evening from meetings with similar objects held in New York,\r\nGlasgow, Belfast, Ipswich, and Aberdeen, and answers had been returned\r\nexpressive of kindly feeling to the different associations. The\r\nsecretary then read a list of contributions received, among which were\r\n100 guineas from Her Majesty the Queen, 100 guineas from His Royal\r\nHighness the Prince of Wales, 100 guineas from the Highland Society of\r\nLondon, 300 guineas from the Caledonian Society of London--in all about\r\n£2500, being by far the largest subscription received at any anniversary\r\nof the Scottish Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL MASONIC INSTITUTION FOR BOYS.\r\n\r\n_March 30th, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventy-second anniversary festival of this institution was held at\r\nFreemason's Hall on the 30th of March, 1870. The Prince of Wales\r\npresided, and was supported by Earl de Grey and Ripon, G. M. elect, the\r\nDuke of Manchester, the Earl of Jersey, Earl Percy, the Marquis of\r\nHartington, and a numerous company of above six hundred brethren, all of\r\nwhom wore dress of the craft. The galleries were crowded with ladies.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner His Royal Highness, in giving the toast of \"The Queen,\"\r\nsaid that Her Majesty had been patroness of the institution since 1852,\r\nand on this occasion sent a donation of a hundred guineas, in addition\r\nto the annual subscription.\r\n\r\nThe next toast was \"The health of the Earl of Zetland,\" the retiring\r\nGrand Master, who had held the honourable and useful post for more than\r\na quarter of a century. The Grand Master elect, the Earl of Ripon, in\r\ngiving the toast of the Prince and the Princess of Wales, said that the\r\nPrince had entered the craft determined to discharge his duties to the\r\nfullest extent, and he had taken the earliest opportunity of presiding\r\nat one of the festivals of the craft. The Prince of Wales, in\r\nresponding, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Brethren, I feel deeply touched by the excessively kind manner\r\n    in which this toast has been received by you. I wish to take\r\n    this opportunity of thanking you for the kind reception you have\r\n    given me this evening, and I desire especially to express to you\r\n    the pride I feel at being so heartily received among you as a\r\n    brother Mason. I feel deeply grateful for the kind words which\r\n    have fallen from the Deputy Grand Master, and I can assure him\r\n    and you of my desire to follow the footsteps of my grand\r\n    uncles, who were so long connected with the craft. Brethren,\r\n    much has been said against Freemasonry by those who do not know\r\n    what it is. People naturally say they do not approve secret\r\n    societies; but I maintain that the craft is free from the\r\n    reproach of being either disloyal or irreligious; and I am sure\r\n    you will all support me in that assertion, for I am convinced\r\n    that Her Majesty has no more loyal subjects than are the\r\n    Freemasons of England. Brethren, I desire to remind you that\r\n    when, about 70 years ago, it became necessary for the Government\r\n    of that day to put down secret societies, my relative the late\r\n    Duke of Sussex urged in his place in Parliament that Freemasons'\r\n    lodges ought to be exempt from such a law, and the force of his\r\n    appeal was acknowledged. From that time Freemasonry has been\r\n    devoid of politics, its only object being the pure and Christian\r\n    one of charity. Brethren, I once more thank you heartily for the\r\n    welcome you have given me this evening, and let me assure you\r\n    that the interests of Freemasonry shall be always upheld and\r\n    respected by me.\"\r\n\r\nOther toasts, usual at Masonic festivals, having been given, the Prince\r\nof Wales proposed success to the institution, and made a statement\r\nrespecting its position and progress:--\r\n\r\n    \"Freemasons had fully recognized the importance of education--a\r\n    subject which had of late so much occupied the public mind--and\r\n    had founded many schools. The Royal Masonic Institution for Boys\r\n    was founded in 1798, when six boys were admitted. In 1810, when\r\n    the jubilee of the reign of George III. was celebrated, the\r\n    number was increased to 50, and now there were 110 in the\r\n    school. The total cost of the new building had been £47,000 of\r\n    which £5000 was still owing, while there were other matters\r\n    which raised the total liability to £10,200. There were now 155\r\n    candidates for admission, but there were only nine vacancies,\r\n    although 20 more boys could be admitted if the institution was\r\n    free from debt. He was sure he had only to mention these facts\r\n    to so distinguished an assemblage of Masons to insure a response\r\n    which would greatly forward the prosperity of the institution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n_April 4th, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn everything pertaining to Exhibitions, national or international, the\r\nPrince of Wales has never grown weary, even when the public interest has\r\nseemed to flag. On the 4th of April, 1870, His Royal Highness presided\r\nat the rooms of the Society of Arts, in connection with the \"Educational\r\nSection\" of a series of proposed International Exhibitions. On rising to\r\nopen the proceedings, the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"We are assembled here for the purpose of organizing the\r\n    educational section of the Exhibition to be held in 1871. I\r\n    appear before you on this occasion in a double capacity, for I\r\n    hold the position of President of your Society, and I am\r\n    President of the Royal Commission of 1851, having succeeded in\r\n    this post the late lamented Lord Derby, whose name will always\r\n    be remembered among the names of our great statesmen, and who\r\n    will be greatly missed from that Commission, the interest of\r\n    which he had so much at heart.\r\n\r\n    \"The long-standing connection of the Society of Arts with\r\n    Exhibitions is well known, and in these very rooms the\r\n    Exhibitions of 1851 and 1862 were first planned. This Society\r\n    is, I consider, well qualified to deal with the subject before\r\n    it, and I assure you that it is a great gratification to me to\r\n    preside here and show that I am entirely alive to the great\r\n    question of the day--that of education.\r\n\r\n    \"I have now to state that the meeting to-day is of members of a\r\n    large Committee, of persons eminent in their various stations\r\n    for the interest they have displayed in education, and that it\r\n    has been appointed without reference to politics, party,\r\n    denomination, or social position, for the purpose of obtaining\r\n    the best possible representation in 1871 of the various\r\n    materials and apparatus used in teaching, and exhibiting, as far\r\n    as practicable, the results of the many systems of instruction\r\n    which are in operation in this country and in other nations of\r\n    the world. Under the first class we find such objects as affect\r\n    the sanitary condition of schools--the desks and stools used,\r\n    maps and globes, books, pictures, scientific diagrams, objects\r\n    of natural history, and the like. Under the second class will be\r\n    shown illustrations of modes of teaching, drawing, reading,\r\n    writing, music, and gymnastics, and the interesting work of\r\n    educating those whom nature has deprived of sight, speech, and\r\n    hearing, with examples of the successful results.\r\n\r\n    \"In this Exhibition of Education, foreigners as well as British\r\n    subjects will take their share, and I am happy to say that\r\n    Sweden has already applied for permission to exhibit a\r\n    full-sized model of one of its parish schools. The duty of this\r\n    Committee is to see that such work as I have sketched out shall\r\n    be completely accomplished, that exhibitors shall come forward\r\n    and offer their productions, that the best only shall be\r\n    selected for exhibition, and that discussions on systems of\r\n    instruction shall be organized. I indulge a sanguine hope that\r\n    the labours of this Committee may teach lessons which will lead\r\n    to the improvement of the quality of primary education, and to\r\n    the extension of that secondary instruction in science and art\r\n    so much needed for the industrial progress of this country, a\r\n    necessity proved at the Exhibition of 1851, originated and\r\n    conducted by my illustrious father, and confirmed again in 1862,\r\n    and at Paris in 1867, where our own artisans showed by their\r\n    remarkable reports how strong were their convictions on this\r\n    point. Difficulties there are, as there must ever be, in the\r\n    completion of a great work, and here I am reminded how fully the\r\n    difficulties connected with this work of education were\r\n    appreciated by my father as long ago as 1851. But my visit with\r\n    the Princess of Wales to the Middle Class Schools in the City of\r\n    London on Wednesday last, and the reports on Faversham School\r\n    and the District Union Schools of the Metropolis, which have\r\n    been published by our Society, lead me on to hope that even\r\n    these difficulties may admit of solution.\r\n\r\n    \"By improved organization of schools and teaching power, I think\r\n    that it is shown that instruction may be so given as to enable\r\n    earning and learning to go hand-in-hand together. I close these\r\n    few remarks by bidding 'God speed' to this Committee in the\r\n    great work that is before them. Two resolutions will be offered\r\n    for your acceptance, and any explanation which may seem\r\n    necessary will be afforded.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolutions, moved by Sir John Pakington, and by the Hon. W. Cowper\r\nTemple, were to the effect that the meeting warmly approved of the\r\nproposed International Educational Exhibition, which would not only\r\nreceive His Royal Highness's sanction, but his personal assistance and\r\nco-operation. It was explained that the feature of these Exhibitions\r\nwould be the arrangement of objects illustrating the progress of art and\r\nindustry, not according to countries, but according to classes. On the\r\nproposal of a vote of thanks to the chairman of the meeting, the Prince\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"I require and desire no thanks at all. It has given me great\r\n    pleasure to be here to open the proceedings, and I cordially\r\n    thank all the gentlemen who have so kindly supported me on this\r\n    occasion. I beg again to assure you that I take a very deep\r\n    interest in this question--that of education, and that I shall\r\n    be always ready to give my hearty co-operation on a subject of\r\n    this important bearing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL GENERAL THEATRICAL FUND.\r\n\r\n_May 16th, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Fund grants relief in annuities to members of the dramatic\r\nprofession, to singers and dancers, and also to the widows and orphans\r\nof members. At present, upwards of £2000 annually is paid to fifty\r\nannuitants. The invested capital is about £12,000. The institution has\r\nthe merit of not being a mere charity, but is largely supported by the\r\nactors themselves. In this respect it holds a more honourable position\r\nthan even the Royal Literary Fund; no attempt to establish a guild for\r\nmutual help among men of letters having, as yet, been successful.\r\n\r\nThe Theatrical Fund was established as long ago as 1839 by a few actors,\r\nand was incorporated by Royal charter in 1853. Part of the income comes\r\nfrom subscribers to the fund; but it is necessary also to appeal to the\r\npublic, in the method common to all charities; the resources of the\r\nprofession not being sufficient to maintain a mutual insurance society\r\non financial unaided by benevolent principles.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales presided at the 25th anniversary\r\nfestival of the Fund at St. James's Hall on the 16th of May, 1870. There\r\nwas a large attendance, including the leading members of the profession,\r\nand some zealous supporters of the drama, among whom were the Nawab\r\nNazim of Bengal, with his two sons, the Princes Ali and Suleiman. Grace\r\nhaving been sung after dinner the Prince gave \"The Health of Her Majesty\r\nthe Queen,\" the patroness of this institution, and an annual subscriber\r\nto its funds. The Duke of Sutherland, in proposing the health of \"The\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales, and other members of the Royal Family,\"\r\nadverted to the constant support given by their Royal Highnesses to the\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\n    The Prince of Wales, in returning thanks, said \"he rejoiced that\r\n    ever since his childhood he had had opportunities of going to\r\n    the theatre and witnessing some of the most excellent plays, and\r\n    appreciating the performances of some of the best actors of the\r\n    present day, many of whom he saw on either side and before him\r\n    on this occasion. The few remarks he had to make regarding this\r\n    most excellent fund must be reserved till a later period of the\r\n    evening, and therefore he would not then detain the company; but\r\n    he must observe that not only had the Princess and himself\r\n    derived considerable amusement from what they had witnessed at\r\n    the theatres, but they had given their patronage to the drama\r\n    because it was their wish to encourage a noble profession.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual toast of the Army, Navy, and Volunteers having been given and\r\nresponded to, the Prince rose, and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"The toast which he had now to propose was the so-called toast\r\n    of the evening, which was 'Prosperity to the Royal General\r\n    Theatrical Fund.' It afforded him great pleasure to propose this\r\n    toast, and when he saw the numerous assembly before him he felt\r\n    no doubt of the great interest taken by all present in this\r\n    excellent charity. What charity, he asked, could be more\r\n    deserving of support? When they considered how much amusement\r\n    and pleasure they all derived by going to the theatre, did it\r\n    ever occur to them that it was to the actors and actresses a\r\n    life of drudgery and hardship? Those same actors and actresses\r\n    who appeared in some comic character might have near and dear\r\n    relations lying sick at home. Then, also, when a time of life\r\n    arrived in the course of nature in which they were unable longer\r\n    to appear upon the stage ought they to be left to starve?\r\n    Certainly not, and it was to prevent aged actors who were\r\n    incapable of work from starving, that this fund had been\r\n    instituted.\r\n\r\n    \"This charity was still more meritorious, because it was\r\n    supported by the actors themselves. The charity was established\r\n    in 1839 by a few London actors, and in 1853 it was incorporated\r\n    by Royal charter. The fund was raised to provide annuities for\r\n    aged and decayed members of the charity, and in special cases\r\n    for granting temporary assistance to the families of deceased\r\n    members. Any member of the profession, on the payment of a small\r\n    annual subscription, ranging from 21_s._ 4_d._ to £28 9_s._ a\r\n    year, according to a special scale, provided he had been\r\n    performing three years in a theatre licensed by the Lord\r\n    Chamberlain or by the local magistrates, was eligible to receive\r\n    the benefits of the fund, but no member had a claim unless he\r\n    had been a subscriber for seven years. Should he then be\r\n    incapacitated from further work, he had the option of either\r\n    receiving a life annuity or one-half the payments made by him\r\n    while a subscriber. On his death an allowance of £10 was granted\r\n    towards defraying funeral expenses. At 60 years of age any\r\n    member was at liberty to claim an annuity if he had subscribed\r\n    to the fund for 12 years, and female members were allowed to\r\n    cease their subscriptions when 55 years old. Since the opening\r\n    of the charity 322 members of the profession had been admitted\r\n    associates. To 61 of these life pensions had been granted,\r\n    varying from £30 to £90 a year. In 1846, the first year in which\r\n    pensions were granted, the receipts amounted to £565, and the\r\n    annuities to £98. Last year the total income was £1370, and the\r\n    amount expended in pensions was £1614. The receipts of 1869\r\n    therefore exceeded those of 1846 by £805, and the pensions, &c.,\r\n    by £1516. Again, while in 1846 only seven members received\r\n    annuities, the number of annuitants had increased to 33 in 1869.\r\n    The total disbursements, however, of last year exceeded the\r\n    income by £368, and it had been found necessary therefore to\r\n    draw that sum from the reserve fund.\r\n\r\n    \"These few remarks would perhaps induce those who heard him to\r\n    come forward liberally to the assistance of the charity, and to\r\n    make up the £300 which it had been necessary to draw from the\r\n    reserve fund. His Royal Highness concluded by calling upon the\r\n    company to drink 'Prosperity to the General Theatrical Fund,'\r\n    coupled with the name of one who, he was sure, they would\r\n    receive with the greatest enthusiasm, as he was one of their\r\n    oldest and ablest actors. He had known Mr. Buckstone personally\r\n    ever since his childhood, and had repeatedly laughed and roared\r\n    at his drollery and humour.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buckstone made a very amusing and characteristic speech, but with\r\ngood sense underlying the drollery. With regard to the presence of the\r\nPrince in the chair, he said: \"That His Royal Highness is a constant and\r\nwarm supporter of the drama is evident from his frequent visits with the\r\nPrincess to all the London theatres, and his ready appreciation of every\r\nworthy novelty. This taste for the drama may in some measure be\r\nattributed to his early introduction to dramatic art at Windsor Castle,\r\nwhere, on having the honour of appearing there by invitation of Her\r\nMajesty and the lamented Prince Consort, I have frequently seen His\r\nRoyal Highness with his brothers and sisters, seated at the feet of\r\ntheir father and mother, witnessing with delight the various\r\nrepresentations.\r\n\r\n\"The members of our fund cannot be too grateful for the kindness and\r\ngoodness of heart which have induced His Royal Highness to come here\r\nto-night, as the calls upon his time have now become so many, and the\r\nduties he has to perform so numerous and fatiguing, that we can only\r\nwonder how he gets through them all. Even within these few days he has\r\nheld a levée; on Saturday last he patronized a performance at Drury-lane\r\nin aid of the Dramatic College; then had to run away to Freemasons'-hall\r\nto be present at the installation of the Grand Master; and now we find\r\nhim in the chair this evening; so what with _conversaziones_, laying\r\nfoundation stones, opening schools, and other calls upon his little\r\nleisure, I think he may be looked upon as one of the hardest working men\r\nin Her Majesty's dominions. Still, it is this ready kindness that\r\nendears him to the nation, as the Princess, by her charming qualities,\r\nis so firmly fixed in the heart of every Englishman and Englishwoman.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen, I must inform you that Her\r\nGracious Majesty has again sent us her handsome donation of £100; and\r\nalthough, unfortunately, she does not now visit our theatres, yet she\r\ndoes not forget us; and so, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen, with such a\r\ntruly Royal example before you, I can only conclude by hoping that,\r\naccording to your generous feelings and your worldly means, you will\r\ncome and do likewise.\"\r\n\r\nLord W. Lennox proposed \"The Visitors,\" coupling with it the health of\r\nthe Nawab Nazim of Bengal, who during his residence in England had\r\nidentified himself with the charities of this country. The Nawab had\r\nbeen a liberal patron of theatrical performances, and had, he\r\nunderstood, only one subject of regret in connection with our London\r\ntheatres--that the plays of Shakespeare were not more frequently\r\nperformed in them. The subscriptions of the evening amounted to £700,\r\nincluding £100 from the Prince of Wales, and £50 from the Nawab Nazim of\r\nBengal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GEORGE'S HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n_May 26th, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of May, 1870, a public meeting was held at the Queen's\r\nConcert Rooms, Hanover Square, in aid of the funds of St. George's\r\nHospital, especially with the view of enabling the Governors to open the\r\nwards of the new wing. The meeting was one of unusual interest, not only\r\nfrom the wide publicity given to the claims of the institution, but also\r\nfrom the announcement that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales would\r\npreside, and from the high distinction of the speakers who were to take\r\npart in the proceedings. The Princess of Wales manifested her interest\r\nin the charity by accompanying the Prince to the meeting. The room was\r\ndensely crowded, and a number of distinguished persons were in the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness, on taking the chair, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--Before opening the\r\n    proceedings of this meeting, allow me to express to you the\r\n    satisfaction I have in being able to accept the invitation to\r\n    preside at a meeting to-day which has for its aim such excellent\r\n    and important objects. We are met here to-day to discuss whether\r\n    it is expedient to open the new wing that has been added to St.\r\n    George's Hospital. Last year a meeting was held for the same\r\n    purpose for which we are met to-day, and it was then thought\r\n    that the subscriptions, although they were to a great extent\r\n    liberal subscriptions, were not sufficient in amount to\r\n    authorize the Governors of the Hospital to open the new wing. It\r\n    has also been much discussed whether it was not an extravagance\r\n    on the part of the authorities to build this new wing. I must\r\n    say--and I think I speak for those on my right and left--that\r\n    the authorities did perfectly right in building that wing, as a\r\n    piece of ground had been presented to them at a nominal rent by\r\n    the late lamented Marquis of Westminster, who always came\r\n    forward voluntarily to assist any great and important work.\r\n    Besides that, a further sum of £5000 was given by Miss Williams\r\n    to the building fund.\r\n\r\n    \"As regards this wing, we all know that St. George's Hospital\r\n    lies near the South-Western and Great Western districts. We also\r\n    know that it lies within the precincts of Kensington, Mayfair,\r\n    and Belgravia. One would have thought that there would have\r\n    been no difficulty, and that the large number of inhabitants in\r\n    those parts, who are increasing monthly, and even weekly, would\r\n    have been able to come forward and contribute sufficiently to\r\n    this excellent institution.\r\n\r\n    \"It has been said that the Hospital of St. George is a rich one,\r\n    but that is a great mistake. One would indeed think that it\r\n    would be rich from its important position, and when one\r\n    remembers how full its wards invariably are. To go back to the\r\n    new wing. After all, it is not a very large sum that is required\r\n    to maintain these wards. The sum only amounts to £2500 a year.\r\n    Is it not, therefore, a scandal, ladies and gentlemen, that for\r\n    the sake of this small sum we cannot use forty-eight beds in\r\n    that wing? The Hospital itself is in want of money, as I will\r\n    prove by stating that last year the expenditure amounted to as\r\n    much as £20,000, while the income was only £15,000. In order,\r\n    therefore, to make up the deficiency, £5000 had to be sold out\r\n    of capital. That will be the case this year, and it may be the\r\n    same in future years. The capital thus diminishing, the income\r\n    will naturally be smaller, and in that way this excellent\r\n    Hospital, which is most admirably cared for, which has the very\r\n    best surgeons and physicians--one of whom, Mr. Prescott Hewett,\r\n    I know personally--will sustain a yearly diminution of its\r\n    usefulness. In this way, if the public do not come forward\r\n    liberally we shall see one of the most excellent and important\r\n    hospitals in London becoming, year by year, in a more difficult\r\n    position with regard to funds.\r\n\r\n    \"I am here to state what I am not sure is known to all of you,\r\n    that, with the exception of one hospital, the average cost of\r\n    beds at the St. George's Hospital is less than in any other\r\n    hospital in London. The authorities of the Hospital are not even\r\n    satisfied with that, and, I believe, intend to appoint a\r\n    committee to inquire still more closely and rigidly into the\r\n    expenditure, in order to do their utmost to lessen that\r\n    expenditure.\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--The address I have to make to\r\n    you is brief. I feel convinced that the gentlemen on this\r\n    platform will advocate the claims of the Hospital in longer,\r\n    more detailed, and more able statements than I have made; but I\r\n    am sure that none can feel more strongly than I do the\r\n    importance of this meeting. I feel certain also that the public\r\n    at large, if they will only take the trouble to reflect, will\r\n    come to our aid. Only to-day I read an excellent leading article\r\n    in the _Times_ in support of the objects of this meeting. I\r\n    thank you once more for the kind way in which you have received\r\n    me, but let me say before I sit down that a most excellent\r\n    example has been set us by a lady who has consented to give the\r\n    sum of £1000 for the maintenance of a ward for the space of two\r\n    years. Let this example not be lost upon us. Let us all try to\r\n    follow it, and liberally open our purses for the sake of an\r\n    institution of such value and importance to all of us who live\r\n    in this part of London.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Cadogan, one of the Treasurers, announced that the Prince of\r\nWales had just handed to him a cheque for two hundred guineas. The\r\nPrincess of Wales had also given a donation of fifty guineas. Miss Read\r\nhad given £500, and the Marquis of Westminster a subscription of £200 a\r\nyear. Mr. Prescott Hewett, the surgeon, gave a hundred guineas, and\r\nother liberal donations and subscriptions were announced, amounting to\r\nupwards of £2000.\r\n\r\nThe principal speakers at the meeting were Earl Granville, the Earl of\r\nDerby, the Earl of Carnarvon, Mr. W. H. Smith, the Marquis of\r\nWestminster, and the Rev. H. Howarth, Rector of St. George's, Hanover\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Westminster, in his admirable speech moving the thanks of\r\nthe meeting to the Chairman, said that he happened to be in Milan a\r\nshort time ago, and, going over a great hospital there, containing\r\nsomething like 3000 beds, he saw in different rooms portraits of the\r\nbenefactors of the institution--some full length, others three-quarters,\r\nsome half-length, and others only heads. On inquiring the reason of this\r\ndistinction, he was informed that the size of the picture depended upon\r\nthe amount of the sum given by the donor. One who gave, say £4000, had\r\nhis portrait painted full length, while the others were represented\r\nhalf-length, or even by a head.... It might be thought a light and easy\r\nthing to come forward and make so excellent a speech as His Royal\r\nHighness had done; but he was quite sure that if any who thought thus\r\nwould come forward to try, they would find themselves mistaken. In\r\ncoming forward in this work of benevolence, His Royal Highness was\r\nfairly entitled to the warm and cordial thanks, not only of the\r\ngovernors of the hospital, but of the whole nation. He begged to include\r\nin this vote the Princess of Wales.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--Allow me to return you all my\r\n    most cordial thanks for the kind way in which you have supported\r\n    me by your presence, and to my noble friend for the way in\r\n    which he proposed the resolution. Not wishing to keep you here\r\n    any longer, let me only urge you to be as liberal as you can,\r\n    and I hope that the excellent speeches we have heard to-day may\r\n    impress you with the importance of this meeting, and with the\r\n    feeling that those speeches have been made not as a mere form,\r\n    but as real and earnest appeals to you to open your purses most\r\n    liberally. Lord Westminster has just alluded to the hospital at\r\n    Milan and to the portraits of different sizes, according to the\r\n    amount of money subscribed by the originals. I have but one\r\n    suggestion to make to you in that respect, and one to which I am\r\n    sure you will respond--that you should all contribute very\r\n    largely that circular golden portrait representative of the\r\n    Queen which this Hospital so much needs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDULWICH COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n_June 21st, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old corporation of \"The College of God's gift\" in Dulwich, in the\r\ncounty of Surrey, was founded in 1619, under letters patent of King\r\nJames I., by Edward Alleyne, player, a contemporary and friend of\r\nShakespeare. Those who knew Dulwich College, before its reconstitution\r\nin recent times, must remember its being spoken of as a notable instance\r\nof \"the abuse of an ancient charity.\" In 1857 the old corporation was\r\ndissolved by Act of Parliament, and a new Governing Body was\r\nestablished, consisting of 19 Governors, of whom 11 were to be appointed\r\nby the Court of Chancery, and the remainder by the parishes of\r\nCamberwell, Bishopsgate, St. Luke, Finsbury, and St. Saviour's,\r\nSouthwark, each appointing two Governors. A further scheme for the\r\nmanagement of the charity was approved by Her Majesty in Council in\r\n1882, greatly modifying the arrangement of 1857. By the latter scheme\r\nthe management of the estate in its eleemosynary branch was wholly\r\nseparated from the educational branch, with separate governing bodies.\r\n\r\nThe great increase in the value of the estates had allowed the\r\nestablishment, in 1857, of Alleyn's School, and a large sum was then\r\nprovided for the erection of school buildings, a splendid edifice being\r\nconstructed by Mr. Charles Barry.\r\n\r\nIt was to open this new school that the visit of the Prince and Princess\r\nof Wales was made on the 21st of June, 1870. By a singular coincidence\r\nthis day was the anniversary of that on which the charter of the College\r\nhad been first signed, on the 21st of June, 1607. The Prince of Wales\r\ndistributed the prizes, after the pupils had delivered speeches, and\r\ngone through the exercises usual in public school examinations and\r\nanniversaries. The recitations were brought to a close with singing the\r\nNational Anthem.\r\n\r\nAt the luncheon which followed, the Rev. W. Rogers presided, and\r\nproposed the health of the Royal visitors.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness, who was loudly cheered on rising to reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--I feel deeply the kind way in\r\n    which you have received this toast, and I can assure you that it\r\n    is with great pleasure we have to-day made so interesting a\r\n    visit to a place which, for all of us, possesses an historical\r\n    interest. It is hardly necessary for me to refer to the early\r\n    history of the College. You all know that it was founded in the\r\n    time of Queen Elizabeth, although the charter was actually\r\n    signed by James I., and that Edward Alleyne was an eminent\r\n    actor, and that he also held, I believe, the post of\r\n    bear-keeper--I hope not bear-leader--to Queen Elizabeth. What we\r\n    witness to-day is a gratifying result of that foundation.\r\n    Everybody who has had the opportunity of seeing this splendid\r\n    building must have derived gratification from the spectacle, and\r\n    also from the proofs which have been furnished that education is\r\n    by no means neglected. These proofs we have listened to in the\r\n    English and French languages, and also in the ancient Greek, and\r\n    we have done so with very great pleasure, in spite of the great\r\n    heat which it was necessary for that purpose to encounter.\r\n\r\n    \"I will not detain you with further remarks. But before I sit\r\n    down let me wish thorough success and happiness to this College,\r\n    and let us hope that the success which has attended the last ten\r\n    years especially of its existence will continue and increase,\r\n    and that year by year it will advance in standing and position\r\n    and in the number of the scholars within its walls. I have now\r\n    the pleasure of proposing a toast which I am sure you will all\r\n    drink with enthusiasm--'The Health of the Master of Dulwich\r\n    College, Dr. Carver.' From the cordial way in which his name is\r\n    cheered by the boys there can be no doubt of his popularity; and\r\n    to his efforts, I believe, much of the success which the school\r\n    has attained is owing.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Carver \"returned his very sincere thanks for this\r\ncompliment, which he took to be meant really for the institution of\r\nwhich he was at the head. The inheritance of the last five\r\nhalf-centuries was a noble one, but with it they inherited many\r\nresponsibilities, resulting from the faults and failings of their\r\npredecessors, and there was much not only to do but to redeem. He\r\nbelieved that a new era for Dulwich College had been inaugurated, and he\r\ntrusted it would hereafter win and occupy a place among the most\r\nimportant and valuable institutions of the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nTheir Royal Highnesses then proceeded to the Library. Before the\r\nceremonies at the School, they had visited the magnificent collection of\r\npaintings, known as the Dulwich Gallery. These pictures were collected\r\nby Sir F. Bourgeois, R.A., bequeathed by him to the College, owing to\r\nhis friendship for Mr. Allen, the Master of the College, at the time of\r\nhis death, in 1810. Some of the best pictures in this gallery were\r\nobtained in Poland, at the time of the partition of that ancient kingdom\r\nby the three Great Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS FOR THE CHILDREN OF SEAMEN.\r\n\r\n_June 30th, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales, on the 30th of\r\nJune, 1870, performed the ceremony of opening the new schools for the\r\nchildren of seamen. There was a large assembly present, including the\r\nLord and Lady Mayoress, the Bishop of London and Mrs. Jackson, the\r\nSheriffs of Middlesex, several Aldermen and public officials. The\r\nschools are situated near the London Docks, in Wellclose Square, where\r\nfor two hundred years stood the church for Danish seamen. The site of\r\nthe buildings was the property of the Crown of Denmark, and, with the\r\nchurch, was purchased from the trustees with money granted from the\r\nBishop of London's Fund. The newly-erected schools afford accommodation\r\nfor 600 children, and the cost was about £5500.\r\n\r\nAn address, giving the history and purpose of the institution, was read\r\nby the vicar of St. Paul's Church for seamen of the port of London, to\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n    The Prince of Wales responded, saying \"it was a source of\r\n    infinite gratification to him to be present at the completion of\r\n    a work originated by his lamented father, and to fulfil his\r\n    benevolent design of providing for the education and religious\r\n    welfare of the children, after having secured a place of Divine\r\n    Worship for the parents. He trusted that the association of the\r\n    site with its former uses would bear its fruit in the success\r\n    of this sacred work of education and religion.\"\r\n\r\nAfter prayers were read by the Bishop of London, the ceremony of\r\ndeclaring the schools open was performed, and purses were presented,\r\nwith donations to the amount of £1500, including a hundred guineas from\r\nthe Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nA luncheon followed, at which the Bishop of London, in proposing the\r\nhealth of the Queen, recalled a saying of George III., who once\r\nexpressed the hope that the time would come when every man in England\r\nwould possess a Bible, and be able to read it. This sentiment was also\r\nfelt by the old King's grand-daughter who now filled the throne, and\r\nnothing was dearer to Her Majesty's heart than the religious education\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nIn next proposing the health of the Prince and Princess of Wales, the\r\nBishop said that the Royal visit of this day would give a prestige to\r\nthe schools which would ensure their popularity in the neighbourhood.\r\nThere was a special interest for the Princess of Wales in the fact that\r\nthey were on the site of the old Danish Chapel, long the only place of\r\nworship for Danish seamen in London.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, in response, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Bishop, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--Allow me in the name of\r\n    the Princess of Wales and myself to tender you my warmest thanks\r\n    for the kind way in which this toast has been proposed and\r\n    responded to. I need not tell you that the proceedings of to-day\r\n    have given us great pleasure, or that we feel a deep interest in\r\n    the success of the schools which we have now opened. When we\r\n    were asked to open these schools and play-grounds for the\r\n    children of seamen and other persons living in this\r\n    neighbourhood, we at once felt that the object was excellent,\r\n    and we were anxious in coming here to-day to evince the interest\r\n    we take in the schools. They have, as has already been\r\n    mentioned, an especial interest for myself, because just\r\n    twenty-four years ago the foundation stone of the neighbouring\r\n    church for seamen was laid by my lamented father. That church,\r\n    during the twenty-four years it has been in existence, has\r\n    answered the purpose for which it was built, and I believe as\r\n    many as 240,000 seamen, together with their wives and families,\r\n    have attended divine service within its walls. Let us, then,\r\n    hope that the children also may receive the benefits of a good\r\n    education and religious training, and that these schools may\r\n    fulfil the object for which they were built.\r\n\r\n    \"In this part of London there are so many poor that good schools\r\n    are especially needed, and as these schools are not intended\r\n    exclusively for the children of seamen, they will probably be\r\n    most beneficial to the neighbourhood at large. Allow me to thank\r\n    you for the way in which you have listened to the few remarks I\r\n    have made, and to assure you that I feel deep gratification in\r\n    being present to-day at the opening of these schools. I have,\r\n    before sitting down, to propose 'The Health of the Lord Bishop\r\n    of London,' to whom we owe our warmest thanks for the kind way\r\n    in which he has come here to take part in the proceedings of\r\n    this day, when he has so many other and important duties to\r\n    perform. As I know that he has another pressing engagement in a\r\n    short time, the fewer words said the better. I therefore call\r\n    upon you to drink the health of the Lord Bishop of London.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW GRAMMAR SCHOOL AT READING.\r\n\r\n_July 1st, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good people of Reading are said sometimes to have grumbled at being\r\nneglected by Royalty, their town being overshadowed by its proximity to\r\nthe Royal borough of Windsor. This notion was effaced by the splendid\r\nevents of the 1st of July, 1870. On that day the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales, with imposing state and ceremony, visited the ancient town, in\r\norder to lay the foundation-stone of a new school, which was to be the\r\nsuccessor of the historical Grammar School, at which Archbishop Laud was\r\neducated, one of the masters of which, Julius Palmer, was martyred\r\nduring the Marian persecution, and which in recent times had attained\r\nhigh celebrity under the scholastic reign of Dr. Valpy.\r\n\r\nThe town was in high festival for the occasion, and distinguished\r\ncompany assembled to meet the Royal visitors. When the Address had been\r\npresented by the Mayor and Town Clerk, giving a summary of the history\r\nof the school, and the purposes of the new undertaking, the Prince\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--I desire to return my cordial thanks\r\n    for your address, and to assure you, on the part of the Princess\r\n    and myself, of the pleasure it affords us to visit a town so\r\n    conspicuous in the pages of English history. It is most\r\n    gratifying to me to co-operate with you, gentlemen, in securing\r\n    for your town the benefits contemplated by the Royal founders of\r\n    this ancient school. In extending to Reading and its county the\r\n    advantages of a middle-class education, you are providing an\r\n    education which, if conducted on sound principles, must conduce\r\n    to the welfare and happiness of all who desire to profit by it;\r\n    and that this result is anticipated is satisfactorily indicated\r\n    by the amount of contributions already subscribed. For myself, I\r\n    sincerely trust that the good work of which we are now assembled\r\n    to lay the first stone may, under God's blessing, prosper and\r\n    accomplish its purpose. It will at least prove to a succeeding\r\n    generation that we, on our part, have striven with all our\r\n    hearts and all our means to ripen the good seed sown by our\r\n    fathers upwards of 300 years ago.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of setting the stone then began, for the ceremony was to be\r\ndone with masonic honours, one side of the tent having been entirely\r\noccupied by the Masons in costume. The Mayor, having received from the\r\nProvincial Grand Master the handsome silver trowel prepared for the\r\noccasion, now asked the Prince, in the name of the School Trustees, to\r\nproceed with the ceremony. The Grand Chaplain offered a prayer, the\r\nArchitect presented his plans, the Grand Secretary read the inscription\r\non the stone, and the Grand Treasurer deposited gold, silver, and copper\r\ncoins of the present reign in the cavity prepared for them.\r\n\r\nThe Prince then proved and set the stone, saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"May the Great Architect of the Universe enable us successfully\r\n    to carry on and finish the work of which we have now laid the\r\n    principal stone, and every other undertaking which may tend to\r\n    the advantage of the borough of Reading and this neighbourhood,\r\n    and may this school be long preserved from peril and decay,\r\n    diffusing its light and influence to generations yet unborn.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the Masons present answered with one accord, \"So mote it be.\"\r\nThe Prince next spread corn on the stone, and from the ewers handed to\r\nhim poured out wine and oil, saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"May the bountiful hand of Heaven ever supply this country with\r\n    abundance of corn, wine, and oil, and all the necessaries and\r\n    comforts of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Brethren again responded in the Masonic formula, \"So mote it be.\"\r\nThen the Treasurer to the school presented to the Senior Master Builder\r\n(Mr. Parnell) a purse of gold, saying: \"It is the pleasure of the Prince\r\nthat those who have hewed the stones, and those who have laid them, and\r\nall who have assisted, should 'rejoice in the light.'\"\r\n\r\nPrayers by the Bishop of Oxford, and the Hallelujah Chorus, performed by\r\nthe band and choir, closed the ceremonial, which was very quaint and\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\nAt the luncheon afterwards given in the Town Hall, the Prince, after\r\nacknowledging the usual loyal toasts, that of the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales having been proposed by the Mayor, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--It gives me great pleasure to\r\n    have an opportunity of expressing to all those present the\r\n    gratification it has given both to the Princess and myself to be\r\n    here this day. I am glad also to have the opportunity of\r\n    congratulating the Mayor and Corporation and the inhabitants of\r\n    Reading on the great success of all the proceedings of the day.\r\n    In passing through the town we could not fail to admire the\r\n    tasteful way in which all the houses and streets were decorated;\r\n    nor was it possible that the arrangements for laying the\r\n    foundation stone of the new schools, and the magnificent\r\n    ceremony attending it, could have gone off better. I trust we\r\n    shall all take a deep interest in the school which is to be,\r\n    succeeding as it does to one which has already existed for a\r\n    great number of years, having been founded by my ancestor Henry\r\n    VII., and receiving a Royal charter from Queen Elizabeth. I\r\n    trust that the wishes expressed by the Mayor concerning the\r\n    school may be realized, and that the children not only of the\r\n    inhabitants of Reading but of the whole county of Berkshire will\r\n    have an opportunity of receiving a thoroughly good education in\r\n    it. I will not occupy your time any longer, but before sitting\r\n    down it affords me great pleasure to propose a toast which I\r\n    feel sure you will all receive with enthusiasm. It is 'The\r\n    Health of the Mayor of Reading.' I am glad to have the\r\n    opportunity of thanking him, as the representative of this\r\n    ancient and loyal borough, for the kind and hearty reception it\r\n    has given to us on this occasion.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Prince, the Mayor announced that His Royal\r\nHighness had generously handed him a cheque for a hundred guineas\r\ntowards the building fund. At night the town was illuminated, and the\r\npeople of Reading had good reason to be pleased with the proceedings of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALBERT GOLD MEDAL TO M. DE LESSEPS.\r\n\r\n_July 7th, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Council of the Society of Arts, on the 7th of July,\r\n1870, the Prince of Wales, as President of the Society, presented the\r\nAlbert Gold Medal to M. de Lesseps. This medal is awarded for services\r\nrendered to arts, manufactures, and commerce; and no services, to\r\ncommerce at least, could have been better rendered than by the\r\nrealization of the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nThe Prince addressed M. de Lesseps in a French speech, of which the\r\nfollowing is a translation:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is with sincere gratification that, as President of the\r\n    Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and\r\n    Commerce, I have the honour of presenting to you to-day the gold\r\n    medal which was founded after the death of my beloved father,\r\n    and which bears his name. This medal is presented every year to\r\n    the person who has distinguished himself most remarkably in\r\n    advancing the interests of the objects for which the Society was\r\n    founded, and I am fully convinced that no recipient has ever\r\n    been more worthy than yourself of this honourable distinction.\r\n    In presenting it, I need scarcely say that the award was\r\n    unanimous, and I may perhaps be permitted to add that I\r\n    stipulated for the pleasure of placing the medal myself in your\r\n    hands. England will never forget that it was to you the success\r\n    of that great enterprise which is so much calculated to develope\r\n    the commercial interests subsisting between herself and her\r\n    Eastern Empire was due; and I trust that since your sojourn\r\n    among us the English people have evinced to you their\r\n    appreciation of the benefits which your great work has conferred\r\n    upon this country. Allow me once more to congratulate you upon\r\n    your grand achievement, and to express my sincere hope, as it is\r\n    my belief, that it will fully realise the brilliant\r\n    anticipations which you have from the first entertained\r\n    respecting it. In conclusion, I must assure you of the pleasure\r\n    I feel in presenting this medal to you, not only as President of\r\n    this Society, but as a personal friend, who has, moreover,\r\n    enjoyed the inestimable advantage of an inspection of the Canal\r\n    under your guidance.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Lesseps replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Monséigneur,--I am happy in receiving from the hands of your Royal\r\nHighness the medal which has been awarded to me by the Society of Arts\r\nand Manufactures. This medal, recalling the respected memory of your\r\naugust father, has a double value in my eyes, for His Royal Highness\r\nPrince Albert, from the commencement of the enterprise of the Suez\r\nCanal, received me with that kindly feeling which was to him habitual,\r\nand which led him always to encourage everything which might be useful\r\nto social progress, to the discoveries of science, and to the\r\ndevelopment of commerce. He received me for the first time in 1858, in\r\nhis private study, where he invited me to explain to him all the details\r\nrelating to the construction of the Canal, and he followed with close\r\nattention upon the map and on the working plan the course of the\r\nprojected scheme as worked out by the engineers. Since that time he\r\ncontinued on several occasions to testify the interest which he felt in\r\nthe enterprise for which the period of commencing the works had arrived.\r\nI thank your Royal Highness and the Society of Arts for having added\r\nthis important manifestation to all the evidences which I have had the\r\ngood fortune to receive from the Government of the Queen and from the\r\npeople of Great Britain. The words of your Royal Highness will remain\r\nengraven in my heart. I have already had the good fortune of finding\r\nmyself with you, Monséigneur, when travelling in the desert, and there,\r\nwhere a man, however highly he may be placed, shows himself as he is, I\r\nhave been able to appreciate the noble character, the lofty mind, and\r\nthe elevated sentiments of your Royal Highness, and I am happy to bear\r\nthis testimony in the presence of the distinguished men who surround us.\r\nI shall ever be, as they are, the devoted partisan of your Royal\r\nHighness. I pray you to present to Her Majesty the homage of my respect\r\nand of my gratitude, and to assure her that the Company which I have the\r\nhonour to direct will be able to maintain the Suez Canal in a condition\r\nwhich will satisfy all the requirements of the great commerce and of the\r\nnavigation of Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nIt is always a pleasure to the Prince of Wales to give the Albert Medal\r\nwith his own hands, sometimes at Marlborough House, as to Sir Henry\r\nBessemer, and to M. Chevalier, the distinguished French Economist. When\r\nthe award was made to Mr. Doulton, the Prince went to Lambeth to make\r\nthe presentation, and said that he would have been glad to have received\r\nMr. Doulton at Marlborough House, but thought it would be more\r\ngratifying to him to have the medal presented in his own place and among\r\nhis own workpeople--an act of gracious considerateness which was well\r\nappreciated by the vast assembly who witnessed the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE THAMES EMBANKMENT.\r\n\r\n_July 13th, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis great work, which, for solidity of construction, durability of\r\nmaterial, and beauty of design, is worthy of the Metropolis of the\r\nEmpire, was commenced early in 1852, but was not completed till the\r\nsummer of 1870. Viewed in connection with the benefits to public health\r\nand convenience, by the improvement of the course of the Thames, and the\r\nremoval of the mud banks formerly disfiguring the shores, the Embankment\r\nmay be truly said to be the greatest public work undertaken in London in\r\nmodern times. Portions of the footway had been previously open for\r\npassengers, and improvements have been since made in the approaches and\r\nin laying out ornamental grounds, but the completion of the roadway,\r\nfrom Westminster to Blackfriars, sufficiently justified the grand State\r\nceremony with which the Embankment was opened, on the 13th of July,\r\n1870, by the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nOn that day, the Prince, accompanied by the Princess Louise, and\r\nattended by the Great Officers of the Household, opened the Embankment\r\non behalf of Her Majesty the Queen. Five Royal carriages, with an escort\r\nof the Royal Horse Guards, proceeded from Marlborough House, by the\r\nMall, Whitehall, and Parliament Street to Westminster Bridge, where they\r\nentered the embankment. Here the procession was joined by the carriages\r\ncontaining the Chairman and members of the Metropolitan Board of Works.\r\nAt Hungerford Bridge an address was presented by the Chairman, Sir John\r\nThwaites. The Royal procession went as far as Blackfriars Bridge, and\r\nthen returned to Westminster Bridge, when the Prince, amidst the cheers\r\nof the multitude, and the salutes of artillery, declared the Embankment\r\nto be open.\r\n\r\nThe reply to the address read by the Prince, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen,--It is a source of great regret to me, as I am sure\r\n    it cannot fail to be to you, that the Queen is unable to be\r\n    present, according to her original intention, at this\r\n    interesting ceremony. In her name I thank you for your loyal\r\n    address, and express to you the satisfaction with which she\r\n    regards the completion of this great work. We must all rejoice\r\n    that while the Embankment and the noble roadway, which I am\r\n    happy this day to open in the name of Her Majesty, add largely\r\n    to the beauty and convenience of the Metropolis, the works\r\n    connected with them may be expected materially to diminish the\r\n    sources of disease and suffering to the inhabitants of this bank\r\n    of the Thames. In no public work of this vast capital has the\r\n    liberal and enterprising spirit of its citizens and the genius\r\n    and resources of our civil engineers been more signally\r\n    displayed. I am commanded by the Queen to congratulate you\r\n    cordially on the issue of your labours in undertakings which\r\n    promise to be so enduring and so beneficent.\"\r\n\r\nFive years before this, on the 4th of April, 1865, the Prince had\r\nvisited the great works erected at Barking, in Essex, and thence to the\r\nErith Marshes to perform the ceremony of starting the great engines\r\nwhich lift the waters of the Southern Outfall Sewer. In a brief speech\r\non that occasion the Prince congratulated Mr. Thwaites, then chairman of\r\nthe Metropolitan Board of Works, and Mr. Bazalgette, the engineer, on\r\nthe completion of an important portion of the great scheme for disposing\r\nof the sewage of London, and purifying the water of the Thames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKMEN'S INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n_July 16th, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1870, while the news of impending war on the continent\r\nstirred public feeling, preparations were being quietly made in many a\r\nhome and workshop for an international exhibition of art and industry.\r\nThe special feature of the display was to be the encouragement of\r\nindividual intelligence and skill, every object exhibited having\r\nattached to it the name of the workman, as well as the firm in whose\r\nemployment he was, if not exercising his art on his own account at home.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales kindly consented to open the exhibition, in the name\r\nof the Queen. This was done on the 16th of July, 1870. Having received\r\nan address, giving an account of the purpose of the collection, the\r\nPrince thus replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen,--I thank you for your address, and assure you that\r\n    it is with very great pleasure I undertake the duty imposed upon\r\n    me by the Queen in opening this Exhibition. The objects proposed\r\n    in it are such as cannot fail to meet with the cordial\r\n    approbation of all who are interested in the growth of our arts\r\n    and manufactures, and who wish to connect that growth with a\r\n    corresponding increase of sympathy and friendly relations\r\n    between employers and their workmen. In imparting to this\r\n    Exhibition an international character, you have sought to extend\r\n    the range of good which may result from it, and by inviting\r\n    competition between our workmen and those of foreign nations,\r\n    not only to afford a wholesome stimulus to both in the exercise\r\n    of their various callings, but to contribute, as far as you can,\r\n    to that kindly intercourse between countries which must in the\r\n    end prove the principal security for the peace of the world. The\r\n    allusion which you have made to my beloved father, who would\r\n    doubtless have regarded this Exhibition with the liveliest\r\n    interest, as the natural supplement of that first one with which\r\n    his name is especially connected, will be as affecting as it\r\n    must be gratifying to the Queen. It will be my agreeable duty to\r\n    report to her the proceedings of to-day, and I have only now, in\r\n    her name, to wish success to the undertaking.\"\r\n\r\nA catalogue of the collection, and a newspaper printed in the building,\r\nwere then presented to the Prince. The catalogue showed that\r\ncontributions had been sent from all the chief industrial centres in\r\nEngland,--Sheffield, Birmingham, Coventry, Worcester,--and from Ireland,\r\nin bog-oak carvings, and articles of the linen and flax industry. The\r\nforeign contributions were from France, Austria, Italy, Holland, and\r\nother parts of the continent. A musical piece composed for the occasion\r\nwas given, and the Old Hundredth psalm sung by the choir, after which\r\nthe Prince declared the Exhibition open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL ALBERT HALL.\r\n\r\n_March 29th, 1871._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences\" was opened by Her Majesty\r\nthe Queen with imposing ceremony on the 29th of March, 1871. The\r\nprocession from Buckingham Palace consisted of nine State carriages, in\r\nthe last of which were the Queen, the Princess of Wales, and the Duke of\r\nSaxe-Coburg and Gotha. In the other carriages were the Royal Family,\r\nwith the great officers of State and the Household in waiting. The Hall\r\nwas filled with nearly 8000 spectators, and the orchestra consisted of\r\nnearly 1200 musicians and singers, Sir Michael Costa being leader.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen had taken her place on the daïs, the Prince of Wales, who\r\nwore the uniform of Colonel of the 10th Hussars, advanced to Her\r\nMajesty, and, as President of the Provisional Committee, read the\r\nfollowing address:--\r\n\r\n    \"May it please your Majesty,--As President of the Provisional\r\n    Committee of the Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences, it is\r\n    my high privilege and gratification to report to your Majesty\r\n    the successful completion of this Hall, an important feature of\r\n    a long-cherished design of my beloved father, for the general\r\n    culture of your people, in whose improvement he was always\r\n    deeply interested. Encouraged by your Majesty's sympathies, and\r\n    liberally supported by your subjects, we have been enabled to\r\n    carry out the work without any aid from funds derived from\r\n    public taxation. I am warranted in expressing our confidence\r\n    that this building will justify the conviction we expressed in\r\n    the report submitted on the occasion of your Majesty's laying\r\n    its first stone, that by its erection we should be meeting a\r\n    great public want. Your Majesty's Commissioners for the\r\n    Exhibition of 1851 in further prosecution of my father's design\r\n    for the encouragement of the Arts and Sciences, an object which\r\n    he always had warmly at heart, are about to commence a series of\r\n    Annual International Exhibitions, to the success of which this\r\n    Hall will greatly contribute by the facilities which it will\r\n    afford for the display of objects and for the meeting of bodies\r\n    interested in the industries which will form the subjects of\r\n    successive Exhibitions. The interest shown in the Hall by the\r\n    most eminent musicians and composers of Europe strengthens our\r\n    belief that it will largely conduce to the revival among all\r\n    classes of the nation of a taste for the cultivation of music.\r\n    Your Majesty will hear with satisfaction that results have\r\n    justified the original estimate of the cost of the building, and\r\n    that, aided by the liberal assistance of your Exhibition\r\n    Commissioners, the corporation will commence its management\r\n    unfettered by pecuniary liabilities, and under conditions\r\n    eminently calculated to insure success. It is my grateful duty\r\n    to return to your Majesty our humble thanks for the additional\r\n    mark of your Royal favour which is conferred upon us by your\r\n    auspicious presence on the present occasion when our labours as\r\n    a Provisional Committee are drawing to a close. We venture to\r\n    hope that when we shall have resigned our functions into the\r\n    hands of the governing body, which will be elected under the\r\n    provisions of the Royal Charter granted to us, your Majesty will\r\n    continue to the Corporation that measure of support which has\r\n    been always graciously given to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen, who had listened to the address with the utmost interest and\r\nattention, said, in a voice clearly heard in every part of the vast\r\nbuilding: \"In handing you this answer, I wish to express my great\r\nadmiration of this beautiful Hall, and my earnest wishes for its\r\ncomplete success.\"\r\n\r\nThe written answer to the address was not read, but it is here given to\r\ncomplete the record of the day's ceremony:--\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you for the loyal address which, as President of the\r\n    Provisional Committee of the Hall of Arts and Sciences, you have\r\n    presented to me. In opening this spacious and noble Hall, it\r\n    gives me pleasure to acknowledge the generous spirit which has\r\n    been manifested in the completion, by voluntary effort, of a\r\n    work promising so much public usefulness. I cordially concur in\r\n    the hope you have expressed, that this Hall, forming as it does\r\n    part of a plan in which I must ever take a deep and personal\r\n    interest, may largely and permanently contribute to the\r\n    promotion among my people of the love of art, as well as to the\r\n    success of the annual exhibitions, which will bring successively\r\n    into instructive competition the choicest products of the\r\n    industries of all nations. These objects could not fail to\r\n    commend themselves at all times and all places to my sympathy\r\n    and interest, fraught as they are with recollections of him to\r\n    whose memory this Hall is dedicated, and whose dearest aim was\r\n    to inspire my people with a love of all that is good and noble,\r\n    and, by closer knowledge and juster appreciation of each other,\r\n    to cultivate a spirit of goodwill and concord among the\r\n    inhabitants of all regions. I gladly give the assurance of my\r\n    support to the corporation to which the Hall is about to be\r\n    entrusted, and I earnestly hope that their efforts to promote\r\n    the objects for which it has been constructed may be rewarded by\r\n    a career of abiding success.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of London, representing the Archbishop of Canterbury, offered\r\na dedication prayer.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, after a minute's conference with Her Majesty, then\r\nsaid, \"THE QUEEN DECLARES THIS HALL TO BE NOW OPENED.\"\r\n\r\nThe announcement was followed by immense cheering and the sound of\r\ntrumpets; and while the choir sang the National Anthem, the Park guns\r\nboomed forth a loud accompaniment.\r\n\r\nThe opening ceremony being thus accomplished, the Queen and the Royal\r\nvisitors proceeded to the Royal box, where they remained during the\r\nperformance of a selection of music. The programme included a cantata,\r\nwritten for the occasion by Sir Michael Costa, and the Prince Consort's\r\n_Invocazione all'Armonia_, which was first performed when Her Majesty,\r\nin 1867, laid the foundation-stone of the Hall this day opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION OF 1871.\r\n\r\n_May 1st, 1871._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty years that had passed since the ever-memorable\r\nExhibition of 1851, there had been many Exhibitions, one of which, that\r\nof 1862, might aspire to the title of Great, and proved fairly\r\nsuccessful. But so numerous were the imitations of the first great\r\nexample, to which, at home or abroad, none approached in romantic\r\ninterest and universal popularity, that at length the idea which in 1851\r\ncharmed all the world, had come to be somewhat tiresome to the public.\r\nInventors and manufacturers found it troublesome and expensive to\r\nexhibit, not without doubt whether there were not more disadvantages\r\nthan advantages in such international displays. Some of the later\r\nExhibitions were little better than huge bazaars or trade shows.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to these conditions, the Royal Commissioners of 1851, with\r\nthe Prince of Wales as President, allowed matters to rest awhile,\r\nalthough still feeling under obligation to carry out the grand purposes\r\nwhich gave rise to the first and grandest display in Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved to open at South Kensington, in 1871, an \"International\r\nExhibition of the Fine Arts and of Industry;\" to be the first of a\r\nseries, each with some definite aim, and mainly confined to certain arts\r\nor industries, instead of forming a miscellaneous museum of all sorts of\r\nobjects. As the Queen approved of this proposal, the opening of the\r\nExhibition of 1871 was undertaken by the Prince of Wales on Her\r\nMajesty's behalf, and was made the occasion of an imposing State\r\npageant. In the Court Circular of May 2nd, and in the journals of the\r\nsame date, a full account is given of the ceremonies of the preceding\r\nday, with lists of the illustrious and notable persons present, and\r\nother details. The Prince made formal proclamation of the opening.\r\n\r\nIn all his labours in connection with various exhibitions, at home or\r\nabroad, the Prince has had most able lieutenants, such as Sir Philip\r\nCunliffe Owen, K.C.B., but every detail of plan and of administration\r\nhas been brought before his attention, and has received the sanction of\r\nhis judgment and experience. It is no exaggeration to say that to his\r\npresidency was mainly due the success of the British Department of the\r\ngreat Paris Exhibition of 1878. This was testified in the address\r\npresented to the Prince by Earl Granville, signed by a thousand\r\nEnglishmen who had witnessed the events of that memorable season in the\r\nPlace de Trocadero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTISTS' ORPHAN FUND.\r\n\r\n_May 7th, 1871._\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the relief of distressed artists, their widows and orphans,\r\nprovision is made, as far as funds allow, by the Artists' Benevolent\r\nInstitution, which was established in 1814. In course of time it was\r\nfound that the amount available for the support and education of the\r\norphans of artists was very insufficient, and a separate fund was\r\nestablished in 1866, under the auspices of the Council of the Artists'\r\nBenevolent Institution. From time to time donations were received, and\r\nin 1871 it was resolved to make a more public appeal. The Prince of\r\nWales cheerfully agreed to preside at a dinner in aid of the fund, which\r\ntook place on the 7th of May, 1871, in the Freemasons' Hall.\r\n\r\nThe Prince was supported by a large number of artists, and of patrons\r\nand lovers of art. The usual loyal toasts were given, and the presence\r\nof members of the well-known \"artist corps\" led the Prince to make\r\nspecial reference to the Volunteers.\r\n\r\nIn giving \"The Army, Navy, Militia, and Volunteers,\" His Royal Highness\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"This is a toast which is never left out at all great public\r\n    dinners. By some it has been called a formal toast, but in my\r\n    opinion it should never be so styled. It is a toast which we\r\n    ought to drink warmly and heartily. Of that which we owe to our\r\n    army and navy I shall not speak to you at length, for this is\r\n    not a fitting occasion; but I may say that we are bound to those\r\n    services by a deep debt of gratitude, and let us hope that we\r\n    shall always have reason to be as proud of them as we are at the\r\n    present moment. We must, at the same time, never forget that\r\n    there is something wanting. Our army is small; smaller than\r\n    those of other countries; it ought, therefore to be better in\r\n    comparison. As to the navy, though a great many changes have\r\n    been made in our ships, though they have been converted from\r\n    wooden walls into iron batteries, I think we may confidently\r\n    anticipate that the fame which attaches to our old wooden walls\r\n    will be transferred to our iron fleet whenever it is called upon\r\n    to meet an enemy. The Militia, too, ought never to be omitted\r\n    from this toast, for I look upon it as our great army of\r\n    reserve, and desire to see it honoured; while as to the\r\n    Volunteers, I would remark that I think we may congratulate\r\n    ourselves on the circumstance that the movement, which has now\r\n    existed for eleven or twelve years, shows no sign that it is\r\n    slackening. I have the more confidence in asking you to respond\r\n    to this portion of the toast, because I see around me many\r\n    members of the Artists' Corps, which has always maintained a\r\n    high position in the Volunteer force.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in proposing the next toast, \"The Artists' Orphan Fund,\"\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have no doubt you will drink this toast in bumpers,\r\n    particularly as this is the first dinner which has been given in\r\n    aid of the Fund. I can assure you it has given me much pleasure\r\n    to come here and explain to you some of the chief points\r\n    connected with this excellent charity. Being a charity in aid of\r\n    orphans it is, you will agree with me, worthy of peculiar\r\n    sympathy. It recommends itself still more to our notice when we\r\n    reflect that it proposes to help the children of those who have\r\n    done so much to elevate and refine art among us, and whose\r\n    beautiful pictures have so often delighted us. Many persons may\r\n    imagine that it is not difficult to be a painter, but the\r\n    distinguished artists whom I see around me will, I am sure,\r\n    agree with me that that it is a great mistake. To be a good\r\n    painter genius is by no means all that is required. Industry and\r\n    perseverance must also be exercised just as much as in the case\r\n    of eminent clergymen, lawyers, scientific men, philosophers, or\r\n    the members of any other branch of human exertion which we can\r\n    name. Again, we must remember that, although a man may have been\r\n    a successful painter, although his genius may have been\r\n    recognized in other countries besides his own, and although he\r\n    may have accumulated money in the course of long, laborious\r\n    years, yet, being laid on a bed of sickness, that money may have\r\n    dwindled away, and his children may be left entirely destitute.\r\n    This fund, then, is destined for the support of the orphans of\r\n    such artists and for their education. No one particular school\r\n    is to be set apart for education. The guardians of the children\r\n    will be allowed to select the schools to which they shall go and\r\n    no restrictions of any kind will be imposed upon them with\r\n    respect to religion. I may add that the first idea of this fund\r\n    came from a gentleman who offered to place a certain number of\r\n    candidates in two schools which he himself established, and that\r\n    he has since given to the charity the munificent donation of\r\n    £900. My only regret is that, while we must all applaud the\r\n    munificence of this gentleman, I am forbidden to mention his\r\n    name. There is, however, another name with respect to which I\r\n    need not be reticent, and which is well known to you all--I mean\r\n    that of Sir W. Tite, who has given the large sum of £1000 to the\r\n    fund. Now, I feel sure you will follow this good example, that\r\n    you will support to the best of your ability this excellent\r\n    charity, and that I need not urge upon you to sign freely the\r\n    papers which have been placed before you. I may add that I am\r\n    authorized by the Council to mention that a sum of £7000 has\r\n    already been collected out of the £10,000 which are required, a\r\n    result for which they beg to return their grateful thanks. But\r\n    though the sum I have just named will enable them to carry out\r\n    the immediate object of the fund, neither they nor any one else\r\n    will have any objection to your adding considerably to that\r\n    amount. I will not detain you longer, but while thanking you for\r\n    your attention will again ask you to drink 'Prosperity and\r\n    success to this most worthy charity.'\"\r\n\r\n    The Prince of Wales then gave \"Prosperity to the Royal Academy,\"\r\n    stating that \"the community at large took the greatest interest\r\n    in that body of gentlemen, for to them we owe the elevated and\r\n    cultivated taste with regard to painting and sculpture which now\r\n    so widely prevailed in this country. The interests of the Royal\r\n    Academy and of Art would, he felt sure, not suffer as long as\r\n    they were confided to the care of Sir F. Grant, the\r\n    distinguished President of that institution.\"\r\n\r\nSir F. Grant, in returning thanks, said the members of the Royal Academy\r\nwere very glad to have it in their power to aid so excellent a charity,\r\nand that, in addition to the £500 which they had given last year to the\r\norphanage in connection with it, they were ready to give on the present\r\noccasion a further donation of £1000. He begged, in conclusion, to\r\npropose \"Prosperity to the other Art Societies.\" The toast was responded\r\nto by Mr. Clint, President of the Society of British Artists.\r\n\r\nThe Treasurer read a long list of subscriptions, amounting in all to\r\n£12,308, including a hundred guineas from the Royal Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL MASONIC INSTITUTION FOR GIRLS.\r\n\r\n_May 8th, 1871._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual festival of the Royal Masonic Institution for Girls was held\r\nat Freemasons' Hall, Great Queen Street, on the 8th of May, 1871, His\r\nRoyal Highness the Prince of Wales presiding. The whole assembly in the\r\nhall was Masonic, the ladies being limited to the gallery of the Temple.\r\nThe Prince wore, besides his Royal and military Orders, the insignia of\r\na Past Grand Master of the English craft, and around him, in full\r\nMasonic \"clothing,\" according to their rank in the craft, were many\r\ndistinguished members.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, in proposing \"The Queen,\"\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"The first toast which I have to give is the health of the\r\n    patroness of our craft--Her Majesty the Queen, who has always\r\n    identified herself so far with our Freemasonry as to extend her\r\n    hand to all charities.\"\r\n\r\nSir Patrick Colquhoun, with the Grand Master's gavel, proposed the toast\r\nof \"The Prince of Wales, the Princess of Wales, and the rest of the\r\nRoyal Family.\" He referred in feeling and touching terms to the loss\r\nlately sustained by the Prince and Princess, the death of an infant son\r\non Good Friday, April 7, and he expressed the deep thankfulness of the\r\nbrotherhood that the Princess was recovering her health.\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, in responding for the\r\n    toast, which had been received with loud applause, thanked the\r\n    brethren, and said \"it gave him the greatest pleasure to be\r\n    there, surrounded by the brethren of the craft to which he was\r\n    proud to belong. He assured them that it was a proud day indeed\r\n    to him when he became a Mason, and he should always do his\r\n    utmost to be a worthy brother among them. He expressed, too, on\r\n    the part of the Princess, his personal thanks to Sir Patrick for\r\n    his touching remarks, and his thanks to the brethren for their\r\n    sympathy. He was glad to announce that the Princess was restored\r\n    to her accustomed health, and in a short time would be among\r\n    them. It might be fitting then to announce that the Princess had\r\n    consented to be the patroness of the institution.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast of \"Earl de Grey, the Grand Master,\" was then proposed by the\r\nRoyal President, and Lord Clonmell proposed \"The Past Grand Master, the\r\nEarl of Zetland.\" \"The Deputy-Grand Master's Health\" was proposed by\r\nMr. C. Sykes, M.P., who dwelt upon the great zeal and ability the Earl\r\nof Carnarvon had shown in following Masonry.\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, in proposing the toast\r\n    of the evening, said, \"in general he felt diffidence in asking\r\n    for subscriptions for charities over which he sometimes\r\n    presided, but he had not such a feeling on that occasion, when\r\n    he looked round and saw on all sides the brethren of the craft,\r\n    for he knew that one of the main principles inculcated in the\r\n    minds of Freemasons was charity. He knew that the brethren\r\n    composing the vast assemblage before him had come with one\r\n    object, to support this excellent institution. A very full and\r\n    able report had been drawn up, and therefore it was not\r\n    necessary for him to address them at any length. He might say,\r\n    however, that the institution was founded for the clothing,\r\n    maintenance, and education of the daughters of decayed\r\n    Freemasons, and it provided that the daughters of trustworthy\r\n    Freemasons should not be left to the pangs of misery and\r\n    ignorance. One important point was that it was supported\r\n    entirely by voluntary contributions, and since its foundation in\r\n    1788 it had educated, clothed, and maintained nearly 1000 girls.\r\n\r\n    \"It was specially interesting for him to be connected with that\r\n    institution, as his grand-uncle, George IV., when Prince of\r\n    Wales, was an earnest supporter of it, and was present at its\r\n    foundation.\r\n\r\n    \"It had been the great object of the committee to give the girls\r\n    a good, sound, simple, and useful education--not what it had\r\n    become the fashion to consider education, but an education\r\n    without any 'padding.' In these days education was more thought\r\n    of than it was fifty years ago, and, indeed, it was the great\r\n    topic of the day. But before this time the Freemasons were among\r\n    the first to set a good example, and having set this good\r\n    example early, it was their duty to keep it up. The committee,\r\n    in order to test the standard of education given in those\r\n    schools, entered some of the names of pupils for the Cambridge\r\n    Local Examinations, and, with very few exceptions, these girls\r\n    so entered had passed the examinations with credit to themselves\r\n    and to the institution. The institution was flourishing in every\r\n    respect. During the past year 100 girls had been received into\r\n    the institution, and as many had gone forth ready to take their\r\n    place in the every-day life of men and women, well instructed in\r\n    all the duties of the positions they would be called upon to\r\n    fill. He urged that it had become necessary to build afresh, and\r\n    as he had himself found that building could not be carried out\r\n    for nothing, the subscriptions of the brethren were looked for\r\n    to assist the committee.\"\r\n\r\nThe secretary read the list of subscriptions, which included 100 guineas\r\nfrom His Royal Highness the Prince, and 25 guineas from the Princess,\r\nand though forty lists were not given in the subscriptions already\r\nreceived amounted to £5000. On a later page will be found the record of\r\nanother anniversary, when the Prince presided, and when the\r\nsubscriptions were about £50,000.\r\n\r\nThe year 1888 is the centenary of the Institution, which flourishes, at\r\nSt. John's Hill, Battersea Rise. The girls are admitted at eight years\r\nof age, and maintained until sixteen. There are nearly 250 in the\r\nschool. The annual revenue, from all sources, is about £15,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLSWOOD ASYLUM FESTIVAL.\r\n\r\n_May 17th, 1871._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1870 the foundation-stone of a new wing to the splendid\r\nedifice of the Earlswood Asylum for Idiots, had been laid by the Prince\r\nand Princess of Wales. The Prince further showed his interest in the\r\ninstitution by presiding at the anniversary festival, held at the London\r\nTavern on the 17th of May, 1871. The Asylum, originally established at\r\nHighgate in 1847, was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1862. Her Majesty\r\nis patroness of the charity.\r\n\r\nOn the removal of the cloth the Prince gave the toast of \"Her Majesty\r\nthe Queen, as the Patroness of the Institution,\" which was received with\r\nevery mark of respect, as was also that of \"The Prince and Princess of\r\nWales, and the rest of the Royal Family,\" proposed by the Duke of\r\nWellington.\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness, in proposing the toast of \"The Army, Navy,\r\n    Militia, and Volunteers,\" expressed a hope that \"the great name\r\n    which the Army and Navy bore in English history would always\r\n    remain unsullied in days to come. We were now at peace, thank\r\n    God, but we might never know from one day to another what might\r\n    occur, and, therefore, we ought always to be prepared.\"\r\n\r\n    Later in the evening, His Royal Highness, in proposing the toast\r\n    of the evening: \"Prosperity to the Earlswood Idiot Asylum,\"\r\n    said, \"he felt convinced there was no charity which had a\r\n    greater demand on the public sympathy and support than it,\r\n    appealing as it did on behalf of the idiot classes, afflicted by\r\n    the will of Providence, and unable for the most part to help\r\n    themselves. The institution was happily in a highly flourishing\r\n    condition, to the great praise of those who had all along\r\n    interested themselves in its prosperity. In 1853 his lamented\r\n    father, who was always ready to assist the afflicted and needy,\r\n    laid the foundation-stone of the present institution; in 1866\r\n    the Princess of Wales and himself interested themselves in a\r\n    bazaar for raising funds for the erection of a new wing to the\r\n    building, and in 1869 Her Royal Highness and himself inaugurated\r\n    that new wing.\r\n\r\n    \"It was a matter of satisfaction to his family and himself that\r\n    they had connected themselves with an institution which aimed at\r\n    so much practical good, and which was now in so flourishing a\r\n    state. It was in 1847 that the late Dr. Reed brought the state\r\n    of the idiot portion of the community under public notice; and\r\n    from that time to this much had been done to ameliorate the\r\n    condition of that most unfortunate class of our fellow\r\n    creatures. Although the cases were comparatively rare in which\r\n    cures had been made, still cures had been effected, and\r\n    practical experience had shown that the mental state of those\r\n    unfortunate beings was susceptible of manifest improvement by\r\n    the exercise of care and attention well directed by intelligent\r\n    and experienced persons. Many of them were taught music, and\r\n    others some trade or handicraft, and in that way their hands and\r\n    minds were occupied. There were cases in which patients so\r\n    engaged had improved so much as to be able to return to their\r\n    families, and afterwards to follow a trade which they had learnt\r\n    in the institution. The Institution had been very highly praised\r\n    by the Lunacy Commissioners, and he might remind the company\r\n    that it was supported by voluntary contributions. This year, he\r\n    believed, the contributions had exceeded those of any previous\r\n    one, but an infirmary had become necessary, although no\r\n    epidemic had hitherto occurred in the asylum; and as that would\r\n    go far to exhaust the funds, he called upon the company to do\r\n    their utmost to replenish them. His Royal Highness made a\r\n    passing allusion, by way of example, to the fact that an\r\n    anonymous benefactor had thrice contributed the sum of £1000 to\r\n    the treasury of the institution, and in conclusion he earnestly\r\n    appealed to the audience to do what in them lay towards the\r\n    relief of that grievously afflicted class of their fellow\r\n    creatures.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the festival Mr. William Nicholas, the secretary,\r\nannounced that the subscriptions in the course of the evening amounted\r\nin all to £4197 odd, including a sum of 100 guineas, under initials,\r\nwhich left no doubt that it was a donation by His Royal Highness the\r\nChairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMES FOR LITTLE BOYS.\r\n\r\n_June 2nd, 1871._\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many institutions for homeless and orphan boys, the Cottage\r\nHomes at Farningham are less heard of than some others which make more\r\nclamorous appeals to the public. But they have for many years been the\r\nscene of useful and beneficent work, and deserve larger support. At\r\nFarningham there are 300 little boys, homeless, and in danger of falling\r\ninto evil ways, who are clothed, fed, educated, and taught some trade by\r\nwhich they can earn their own living. They are then provided with\r\noutfit, and placed in situations, where they are looked after as Old\r\nBoys. This is a charity which was certain to awaken the sympathy and\r\nreceive the support of the Prince of Wales, when brought under his\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of June, 1871, His Royal Highness presided at a festival at\r\nthe Freemasons' Hall for the benefit of the charity. He had already with\r\nthe Princess of Wales visited the Homes at Farningham, and then laid the\r\nfoundation-stone of the new buildings there. At the festival dinner, in\r\ngiving the toast, \"Prosperity to the Home for Little Boys,\" the\r\nfollowing is the substance of what the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"The object of the promoters of this excellent charity had been\r\n    to take from the highways of this vast Metropolis those\r\n    unfortunate little beings who had been deprived of their\r\n    parents, or who had no homes, and to clothe, feed, educate, and\r\n    train them so that they might be enabled to go forth into the\r\n    world with a knowledge of some trade, and qualified, when they\r\n    left this admirable home, to earn their living, by being removed\r\n    from the temptations to crime, incident to the state of\r\n    destitution in which they were found. What could be more\r\n    dreadful than to see from day to day those wretched miserable\r\n    little children, who swarmed in our streets, who knew as little\r\n    as we did how or where they could live, or who were their\r\n    parents and natural protectors?\r\n\r\n    \"It must be felt, then, to be the duty of every good Christian\r\n    to endeavour to ameliorate the condition of that class of our\r\n    fellow-creatures. He could speak from experience of the good\r\n    that had been done by this charity, because he had, with the\r\n    Princess, visited the institution. The asylum was erected about\r\n    seven years ago near Tottenham, but as it was thought desirable\r\n    to move further into the country, about 90 acres of ground were\r\n    purchased near Farningham, in Kent, and the homes were\r\n    established there. He then described the education received by\r\n    the boys, their excellent schooling in such subjects as\r\n    arithmetic and geography, besides the industrial training, which\r\n    was a special feature of the institution. He found that they\r\n    were taught to make clothes, boots, mats, &c.; there was a\r\n    carpenters' shop and a painters' shop, and a paper-bag shop;\r\n    they had a printing establishment, a laundry, a bakehouse, a\r\n    garden, a farm, and there were means for teaching the pupils a\r\n    great variety of other useful occupations, so that they might go\r\n    forth good and honest young men, capable of gaining their own\r\n    livelihood, instead of returning to those haunts of vice from\r\n    which they had been snatched. The cost of the homes was about\r\n    £9000 a year, but he was sorry to say the institution was still\r\n    about £5000 in debt. Mentioning the munificent donation of\r\n    £1000, which had recently been received from some anonymous\r\n    benefactor, His Royal Highness concluded, amid prolonged cheers,\r\n    by urging those present to contribute liberally, and to try to\r\n    persuade others to support this excellent institution, and so to\r\n    rescue as many as possible of the poor little suffering children\r\n    of the country, who had neither father nor mother living, from\r\n    wretchedness and crime.\"\r\n\r\nA list of subscriptions and donations during the dinner was read,\r\namounting to the sum of £3464, including £1000 obtained from friends by\r\nMr. Robert Hanbury, then the President of the institution, and £150 from\r\nthe Royal Chairman.\r\n\r\nBesides the Cottage Homes at Farningham, there are Orphan Homes at\r\nSwanley, where 200 orphan or fatherless boys are maintained, and receive\r\ntechnical education in various arts and industries, to fit them for a\r\nworking life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL CALEDONIAN ASYLUM.\r\n\r\n_June 28th, 1871._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 56th anniversary festival of this institution was held on the 28th\r\nof June, 1871, at the Freemasons' Tavern, under the presidency of the\r\nPrince of Wales, who wore the Highland costume, supported by Prince\r\nArthur and the Duke of Cambridge. About 350 sat down to dinner, a large\r\nproportion being dressed in full Highland costume, among whom were the\r\nDuke of Buccleuch, K.G., President; the Duke of Richmond, K.G.; the\r\nMarquis of Lorne, M.P.; the Marquis of Huntly, the Earl of Fife, the\r\nEarl of Mar, and the Earl of March.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Chairman, in proposing the toast of \"Her Majesty\r\nthe Queen,\" alluded to the fact that Her Majesty was the patroness of\r\nthis institution, in which she had always taken the warmest interest.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buccleuch proposed \"The health of His Royal Highness the\r\nChairman, the Princess of Wales, and the rest of the Royal Family.\"\r\nSince the foundation of this institution in 1815 the Royal Family had\r\nalways responded most generously to every appeal that had been made to\r\nthem on its behalf, and he trusted that in consequence of the presence\r\nof His Royal Highness on that occasion the funds of the charity would be\r\nconsiderably increased. He reminded his audience that among his other\r\ntitles His Royal Highness possessed that of the Duke of Rothesay.\r\n\r\nThe toast was received with Highland honours, followed by the breaking\r\nof the glasses from which it had been drunk. The Gaelic verses timing\r\nthe cheers were recited by Mr. Donald Mackenzie.\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness the Chairman \"expressed his sincere thanks at\r\n    the enthusiastic reception which had been given to the toast,\r\n    and his gratification that it had been drunk with Highland\r\n    honours. He was very sensible of the kindness of the feeling\r\n    that had prompted the latter act, and he begged to be regarded\r\n    on that occasion rather as the Duke of Rothesay than as the\r\n    Prince of Wales. This excellent institution had been associated\r\n    for so many years past with various members of his family that\r\n    he was rejoiced to be able to be there that night to plead in\r\n    its favour.\"\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness in proposing \"The Army, the Navy, and the\r\n    Reserve Forces,\" took occasion to refer to the changes that were\r\n    about to be effected in the organization of the army, and\r\n    \"expressed a hope that those changes, whatever they might be,\r\n    would place the safety or the country upon a secure foundation,\r\n    and would enable us to prove that the author of the well-known\r\n    _Battle of Dorking_ was a false prophet. The writer of that\r\n    interesting production, however, deserved our thanks, inasmuch\r\n    as he had pointed out to us the danger of being 'caught\r\n    napping.' He begged to couple with the toast the name of his\r\n    Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, who had already acted as\r\n    chairman of the festivals of the charity, of Sir A. Milne, and\r\n    of Colonel Loyd Lindsay, who had given such an impetus to the\r\n    Volunteer movement, and who had taken such an active part in\r\n    promoting the fund for the relief of the sick and wounded during\r\n    the late war.\"\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness in proposing the toast of the evening,\r\n    \"Prosperity to the Royal Caledonian Asylum,\" referred to \"the\r\n    objects of the institution which is for supporting and educating\r\n    the children of soldiers, sailors, and marines, natives of\r\n    Scotland, who have died or been disabled in the service of their\r\n    country, and of indigent Scotch parents resident in London. The\r\n    charity had been founded in 1815, a memorable year for this\r\n    country, and from that time until his death his lamented\r\n    grandfather had presided over its interests. For his own part he\r\n    could only express the satisfaction he felt at being connected\r\n    with an institution which had received the patronage of Royalty\r\n    for so long a period. On the occasion when his grandfather had\r\n    presided at one of the festivals of the institution a large sum\r\n    of money was subscribed for its support, and he trusted on that\r\n    occasion its funds would be considerably increased, so as to\r\n    enable the thirty vacancies to be filled up, in addition to\r\n    providing board, lodging, clothing, and education for the 110\r\n    boys and girls now received within the building. The children\r\n    were given a thoroughly sound education, and many of those who\r\n    had been brought up in the establishment had subsequently\r\n    distinguished themselves in the Army, the Navy, and the Law.\r\n    This charity, which was entirely supported by voluntary\r\n    contributions, was the only one in London intended solely for\r\n    the children of Scotch parents, and, therefore, he called upon\r\n    all Scotchmen to contribute liberally in aid of its funds. It\r\n    conferred much happiness upon our soldiers and sailors that they\r\n    were able to feel assured that in the event of their death in\r\n    action their children would be brought up in decency and\r\n    comfort, and that they would not be allowed to fall victims to\r\n    want and sin.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with three times three. His Royal Highness the\r\nChairman then briefly proposed \"The Health of his Grace the Duke of\r\nBuccleuch, the President of the Institution,\" to which his Grace\r\nresponded.\r\n\r\nThe donations announced amounted to about £2000.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the evening, the children, headed by their pipers,\r\nmarched round the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN AGRICULTURAL SHOW.\r\n\r\n_August 1st, 1871._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Agricultural Society, of which the Prince of Wales is\r\nPresident, held its annual meeting at Dublin in 1871. The occasion was\r\ntaken for a royal visit to Ireland. The Prince of Wales was accompanied\r\nby the Princess Louise, the Marquis of Lorne, and his young brother,\r\nPrince Arthur, better known in after years as the Duke of Connaught. Of\r\nall the Royal family, this son of the Queen has special relation to\r\nIreland. One of his names he bears after the great Duke of Wellington,\r\nArthur Wellesley, an Irishman; another of his names is after an Irish\r\nsaint, and he sits in the House of Lords by an Irish title. Born in May\r\n1850, Arthur Patrick was only a little past coming of age at this time.\r\n\r\nThe warm-hearted Irish people gave the royal Princes a truly cordial\r\nwelcome. On arriving at Dublin, there was not merely official display,\r\nbut the popular reception was not only friendly but enthusiastic. Flags\r\nwaved everywhere, and as it was late in the evening, the city was\r\nilluminated, and _Cead mille failthe_ shone out in conspicuous\r\nbrilliancy. From a few knots of Fenians there were heard slight sounds\r\nof hissing, but any hostile feeling was overborne by the general\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\nWhen the train from Kingstown arrived at Westland Row Terminus, the Lord\r\nMayor and Corporation met the Royal visitors, and the Town Clerk read\r\nan address to which the Prince made an appropriate reply.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, August 1st, the royal visitors, having witnessed a\r\ncricket match in College Park, and had luncheon with the officers of the\r\nGrenadier Guards, went to the Show-yard in the afternoon. The Prince of\r\nWales proceeded to the Council-room, and signed the minutes of the last\r\nmeeting, in the capacity of President of the Council. The inspection of\r\nthe horses, cattle, and sheep was then made. Among the awards, made by\r\nthe judges of the Show in the forenoon, was a prize for the best pen of\r\nshearling ewes, exhibited by His Royal Highness.\r\n\r\nThe annual banquet was given in the evening at the Exhibition Palace. It\r\nwas a brilliant and successful affair. About 450 guests were present,\r\nand the galleries were thronged with ladies. When the Prince entered and\r\ntook his place at the head of the table there was tumultuous applause.\r\nAfter dinner the Prince rose and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--The first toast which I have the\r\n    honour of proposing to you this evening is one which I am sure\r\n    will be heartily received by you. It is 'The Health of Her\r\n    Majesty the Queen.' In proposing this toast I am convinced that\r\n    the Queen has a part in the best wishes of the Irish people.\r\n    Although, unfortunately, some time has elapsed since she has\r\n    been over in Ireland, still I hope the day will yet come when\r\n    she may again come over. I am also convinced that the reception\r\n    she has met on former occasions she will meet with again. I will\r\n    not add more, but ask you to drink the health of Her Majesty the\r\n    Queen.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with loyal fervour. After a short interval the\r\nPrince of Wales again rose and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--I have some slight difficulty in\r\n    proposing the next toast, because it relates to members of my\r\n    own family; still, as it is on the list before me, I propose\r\n    'The Health of the rest of the Royal Family.' I am sure that it\r\n    has been the wish of my brothers not to be useless appendages of\r\n    the State, but to do all they can to serve their country. My\r\n    brother, the Duke of Edinburgh, as you are aware, has for some\r\n    time past been in the Royal Navy, and has had the advantage of\r\n    seeing many countries, and I may say of twice sailing round the\r\n    world. On my left is my brother who is serving in the Army, and\r\n    who responds to this toast. I trust that he has also a bright\r\n    career before him. He has some slight claim upon you,\r\n    gentlemen, as he bears the name of Patrick. Without saying more,\r\n    I beg you to drink the health of the rest of the Royal Family,\r\n    coupled with the name of Prince Arthur.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal highness Prince Arthur, on rising to respond to the toast, was\r\nreceived with loud cheers, renewed during the short but effective and\r\nwell delivered speech, in which he referred to a former visit to\r\nIreland, when he was received with much kindness and cordiality. \"That\r\nvisit was certainly but a short one, but it was long enough to enable me\r\nto see a good deal of the country, and to inspire in me a lasting\r\ninterest in all that concerns the welfare of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, in proposing the next toast, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ladies and Gentlemen,--It is now my pleasing duty to propose\r\n    'The Health of His Excellency the Lord-Lieutenant, and\r\n    Prosperity to Ireland.' Nothing could give me greater pleasure\r\n    than having the honour of proposing this toast. I am convinced\r\n    that all the Lords-Lieutenant that come over to Ireland do their\r\n    utmost to fulfil their duties, and sometimes they are very\r\n    arduous ones, and I feel convinced that his Excellency on my\r\n    right has the goodwill of the country. The theme before\r\n    me--Prosperity to Ireland--is one that might be enlarged upon\r\n    greatly. Nobody wishes more sincerely than I do prosperity to\r\n    this country. No one in the large assemblage which crowds this\r\n    hall, and no one outside this hall, could more largely wish for\r\n    the prosperity of Ireland which was so dear to them. I think I\r\n    may say without fear of contradiction, that at the present\r\n    moment Ireland is rich and prosperous. There has been a great\r\n    decrease of pauperism and of crime, and I may say that what will\r\n    do more than anything else towards making a country prosperous\r\n    is the extension of its agriculture. It was with great pleasure\r\n    that I accepted the position of President of the Royal\r\n    Agricultural Society, and it afforded me great pleasure to be\r\n    present for a short time at the Show to-day. My brother has\r\n    already alluded in his speech to the fine animals we saw, and I\r\n    may add that I feel sure that in no other part of the United\r\n    Kingdom could a more creditable Show be held than that which was\r\n    opened near Dublin this morning. During the last four years\r\n    there has been a great improvement in every respect in the shows\r\n    of the Royal Agricultural Societies. I believe I am not wrong in\r\n    stating that in 1867 the entries in the department of horses\r\n    numbered 257, and now, on this occasion, they are but one short\r\n    of 600. That alone shows the interest which all classes of the\r\n    community take in these Shows, and how anxious each one is to do\r\n    all in his power to promote the object it has in view.\"\r\n\r\nAlluding to the interest which the Earl of Pembroke had shown in the\r\nwelfare of the country, and his liberality in granting a site for the\r\nShowyard, His Royal Highness said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am assured that if the many gentlemen and landlords who very\r\n    often find some difficulty in leaving England, but who have\r\n    large interests and large estates in this country, could\r\n    contrive to come over here more frequently, it would do more\r\n    good than anything else I could imagine. I am certain that they\r\n    are anxious to come over, and that their relations with their\r\n    tenantry and those around them should be in every respect good.\r\n    I may also here refer to the great improvement made in the\r\n    erection of farm buildings and cottages. Beyond doubt there has\r\n    been progress in the direction of improvement there; but still I\r\n    believe much yet remains to be done. Everything depends upon the\r\n    well-being of the people, and if they are properly lodged it\r\n    tends to cleanliness, and very possibly to moral advantage.\r\n    Perhaps I may be allowed to speak of a slight personal\r\n    experience in that matter. I have a small estate in Norfolk, and\r\n    observed myself the greatest importance of providing suitable\r\n    small cottages for those resident there, and, having done so,\r\n    now reap immense advantage. I am sure that this is a question\r\n    which belongs in itself to the well-being of Irish agriculture,\r\n    and which will accordingly receive the best consideration of\r\n    this society. There are many other topics upon which I might\r\n    enlarge, but as there are still many toasts to be proposed and\r\n    responded to, time will not permit. Besides, as you are aware,\r\n    the excellent society under whose auspices we are assembled,\r\n    while endeavouring to do as much good as possible, has no\r\n    political connection whatever. You will, therefore, I am sure,\r\n    forgive me if I do not enlarge more fully on other topics which\r\n    might have some political bearing. I give you 'The Health of his\r\n    Excellency the Lord-Lieutenant, and Prosperity to Ireland.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Lord-Lieutenant, Earl Spencer, in responding, said that since they\r\nlast met there had been much prosperity in the country. It was a happy\r\nthing that they were able to mark this. The calling out of the Irish\r\nMilitia had tended to encourage the confidence and loyalty of the\r\npeople. His Excellency hoped that the improved relations established by\r\nrecent legislation between landlord and tenant would have beneficial\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency then proposed \"The Health of the Prince of Wales,\" who\r\nresponded, and after several other toasts the party separated.\r\n\r\nThe Royal visitors, accompanied by the Countess Spencer and the Princess\r\nLouise, afterwards proceeded to the Lady Mayoress's ball at the Mansion\r\nHouse. The city was brilliantly illuminated at night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe enthusiastic reception of the Royal Princes, and the success of this\r\nvisit to Ireland gave much public satisfaction at the time, and is\r\nregarded with interest now, in the light of subsequent events. There had\r\nbeen some misgivings, lest the Prince might meet with an uncourteous or\r\nat least a cold and uncordial reception. But this had never been the way\r\nof Irishmen, even under what might seem unpropitious conditions. The\r\nmost loyal and enthusiastic greeting ever given to a Sovereign, was that\r\nwhich welcomed the Queen in 1849, just after the treason of Mr. Smith\r\nO'Brien, and at the close of a long period of agitation. Still more\r\nremarkable was the welcome given to George IV. in 1821. There were\r\nneither personal nor political reasons for expecting much enthusiasm on\r\nthat occasion. It was well known that the new king, like his father\r\nbefore him, and the brother who then stood next to the throne, were\r\ndetermined opponents of Catholic Emancipation. But no sooner had this\r\nking set foot on Irish soil, and left the name of Kingstown to the place\r\nwhere he landed, than every political grievance, penal laws and\r\nProtestant ascendency, were all for the time forgotten. The truth is\r\nthat whatever agitation may be at the surface, the masses of the Irish\r\nnation, like the deep waters of the ocean, are not so disturbed as to\r\nmove them to disaffection or disloyalty. There was no Irishman more\r\nloyal than Daniel O'Connell, and many of the Home Rulers of our own day\r\nare not less loyal to the British Crown. There is no fear of the Queen\r\nor any of her children being received by the mass of the Irish people\r\nwithout demonstrations of joy. Rather the complaint is that Ireland has\r\nso much less of the Royal sunshine than Scotland enjoys, and it might be\r\nwell if the sister island became the permanent residence of a member of\r\nthe reigning House.\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts have no bearing on party politics, but are naturally\r\nsuggested in remembering the reception given in 1871 to the heir to the\r\nBritish Crown.\r\n\r\nA succession of engagements and of entertainments took place, as on the\r\nvisit of the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1868. The military display\r\nin the Phoenix Park was even more brilliant than on that occasion. One\r\nnotable incident in 1871 was the installation, with great ceremony, of\r\nHis Royal Highness as Grand Patron of the Masonic Institution in\r\nIreland. A formal address of welcome having been read, His Royal\r\nHighness made the following reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"Most Worshipful Sir and Brethren,--I thank you very much for\r\n    your cordial and grateful address, and for the kind sentiments\r\n    expressed in it towards myself. It was a source of considerable\r\n    satisfaction to me when I was elected a member of the craft, and\r\n    I think I may without presumption point to the different Masonic\r\n    meetings which, since my initiation, I have fraternally\r\n    attended. As a proof of the interest I take in all that relates\r\n    to Freemasonry, I can assure you that it has afforded me great\r\n    gratification to become the Patron of the Most Ancient and\r\n    Honourable Society of Free and Accepted Masons in Ireland, and\r\n    that an opportunity has been given to me by my visit to Ireland\r\n    of being installed here to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master then clothed His Royal Highness with the collar, apron,\r\nand jewel, as Patron. The Brethren then, according to ancient custom,\r\nsaluted the Prince as Patron of the Order in Ireland, the Grand Master\r\nhimself giving the word. His Royal Highness then said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Most Worshipful Sir and Brethren,--I have now to thank you\r\n    heartily and cordially for your fraternal reception, and for the\r\n    honour you have done me, and I beg to assure you of the pleasure\r\n    I feel on having been invited to become the Patron of the Order\r\n    of Freemasons in Ireland. It is a source of considerable\r\n    satisfaction to me to know that my visit to this country has\r\n    afforded this opportunity of meeting you, Brethren, in Lodge,\r\n    and so interchanging these frank and hearty greetings. It is\r\n    true I have not been a Mason very long. I was initiated, as you\r\n    perhaps know, in London, a few years ago, after which I visited\r\n    the Grand Original Lodge of Denmark, and a short time afterwards\r\n    I had the signal satisfaction of being elected a Past Grand\r\n    Master of the United Grand Lodge of England. Last year I had the\r\n    honour of being elected Patron of the Order in Scotland; and,\r\n    Brethren, though last, not least, comes the special honour you\r\n    have conferred on me. I thank you for it from the bottom of my\r\n    heart. I may, I think, refer with some pride to the number of\r\n    Masonic meetings I have attended in England since my initiation\r\n    as a proof of my deep attachment to your Order. I know, we all\r\n    know, how good and holy a thing Freemasonry is, how excellent\r\n    are its principles, and how perfect the doctrine it sets forth;\r\n    but forgive me if I remind you that some of our friends outside\r\n    are not as well acquainted with its merits as we are ourselves,\r\n    and that a most mistaken idea prevails in some minds that,\r\n    because we are a secret society, we meet for political purposes,\r\n    or have a political bias in what we do. I am delighted,\r\n    Brethren, to have this opportunity of proclaiming what I am\r\n    satisfied you will agree with me in--that we have as Masons no\r\n    politics; that the great object of our Order is to strengthen\r\n    the bonds of fraternal affection, and to make us live in pure\r\n    and Christian love with all men; that though a secret we are not\r\n    a political body; and that our Masonic principles and hopes are\r\n    essential parts of our attachment to the Constitution and\r\n    loyalty to the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness's address was received with great applause. The Lodge\r\nwas then closed in due form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ILLNESS OF DECEMBER, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much the Prince of Wales had endeared himself to all classes\r\nin the nation was attested by the deep anxiety and the universal\r\nsorrow when he was struck down with illness in December, 1871.\r\nThose who remember that time, can tell how, for some weeks, all\r\nthoughts were turned to the chamber of sickness at Sandringham;\r\nwith what earnest anxiety the daily bulletins were looked for; and\r\nwith what fervent devotion the prayers of millions ascended to the\r\nthrone of grace. The \"dark December\" of 1861, when the good\r\nPrince Consort lay on his deathbed, increased the ominous foreboding.\r\nTouching incidents of that critical period are still told. The\r\nwatchful attendance of the Princess of Wales was illustrated in no\r\nway more strikingly than in the anecdote of her request to the clergyman\r\nat Sandringham to alter the order of the morning service so as\r\nto let her, after joining in the public prayer for recovery, hasten\r\nback to her husband's side. We remember, too, the affectionate\r\nanxiety of the royal mother, and brothers and sisters; and how the\r\nPrince himself, when he recovered consciousness, asked thoughtfully\r\nabout the condition of the servant, who died of the same fever\r\nwhich nearly proved fatal to his master.\r\n\r\nHad the Prince been \"taken\" at this period of his life, history would\r\nhave recorded the loss in terms of tender regret, such as had been, more\r\nthan once, felt towards Princes of Wales who died before coming to the\r\nthrone. The eldest son of James I., for instance, was long remembered\r\nwith deepest sorrow, so much was he loved, and so large the hopes of the\r\nnation which had been centered in him. Had our Prince been lost in that\r\nillness, there would have been another instance of what inspired one of\r\nthe noblest of all passages in classic literature, the \"_Tu Marcellus\r\neris_\" of Virgil. Happily it was otherwise ordained, and the enthusiasm\r\nof joyful thankfulness at the recovery of the Prince was as truly\r\nnational as had been the anxiety and grief at his illness. The special\r\nThanksgiving Collect, written by the Archbishop of Canterbury, expressed\r\nwell the universal feeling of the nation:--\r\n\r\n\"O Father of mercies and God of all comfort, we thank Thee that Thou\r\nhast heard the prayers of this nation in the day of our trial. We praise\r\nand magnify Thy glorious name for that Thou hast raised Thy servant\r\nAlbert Edward Prince of Wales from the bed of sickness. Thou castest\r\ndown and Thou liftest up, and health and strength are Thy gifts. We pray\r\nThee to perfect the recovery of Thy servant, and to crown him day by day\r\nwith more abundant blessings both for body and soul; through Jesus\r\nChrist our Lord. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Thanksgiving day was proclaimed, it was still doubtful whether\r\nthe Prince himself would be allowed by his medical attendants to risk\r\nthe winter journey for Osborne, along with the Queen. But his own desire\r\nto be present nerved him for the effort, and he obtained the assent of\r\nSir James Paget, who had gone specially to give his opinion.\r\n\r\nThe danger had increased in the end of November and the first weeks of\r\nDecember. The first hopeful announcement was made on December 17th, and\r\non January 3rd convalescence had decidedly begun. A public thanksgiving\r\nservice was proclaimed for the 21st of January. On February 22nd the\r\nLetter of the Queen to the nation was published, and then followed the\r\nNational Thanksgiving Service in St. Paul's on the 27th.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Royal procession, and the display inside the\r\nCathedral, the scene was far less imposing than on that famous day, the\r\n23rd of April, 1789, when King George III. and Queen Charlotte went to\r\nSt. Paul's to return public thanks for His Majesty's restoration to\r\nhealth. On that occasion there was more of heraldic pageantry, and more\r\nof official display, than accords with modern usage. But everything was\r\ndone to make this assemblage as far as possible representative of all\r\nclasses in social and public life. Not fewer than 13,000 persons had\r\nplaces allocated to them in the Cathedral. In the _Times_ of Wednesday,\r\nFebruary 28th, a full classified list of the ticket-holders will be\r\nfound. About 300 Mayors and Provosts from all parts of the kingdom had\r\nplaces. There were 560 places for representatives of the Army and Navy.\r\nThe Peers and Commons had 885 tickets for each house. The Dean of St.\r\nPaul's had nearly 1300 tickets at his disposal. The Corps Diplomatique,\r\n\"distinguished foreigners,\" London School Board, the Board of Works,\r\nLearned Societies, Nonconformists, and numerous other bodies figure in\r\nthe catalogue. The wearers of uniform and official dress, besides the\r\ngaudy civic corporations, gave variety to the scene. The Judges,\r\nEnglish, Scotch, and Irish, with robes and wigs, gave warm tone to the\r\nLaw corner. Special state chairs were occupied by the Lord Chancellor\r\nand the Speaker, representing Parliament. The Press had 80 places, and\r\nthe \"General Public\" made up the number 12,480 tickets--those who took\r\npart in the procession--the stewards, police, firemen, and the officials\r\nbringing up the total to about 13,000.\r\n\r\nThe crowds lining the streets, for about seven miles along which the\r\nprocession passed, were innumerable; and every window and coign of\r\nvantage, with numerous scaffoldings along the line, appeared filled with\r\nspectators. Not even when the Princess of Wales entered London was there\r\nsuch a dense multitude seen, and it is only on rare occasions that one\r\ncan see \"all London in the streets.\" In our time we can remember some\r\nsuch occasions--the funeral of the Duke of Wellington, the reception of\r\nthe Princess of Wales, and the entrance of Garibaldi, being among them.\r\n\r\nIt was not in the Metropolis alone, that the rejoicing was universal.\r\nEvery city and town had its festivities, and its services of\r\nthanksgiving in Church and Chapel. Addresses came, by hundreds, from all\r\nquarters, and the announcement was made of holiday gatherings, of\r\ncrowded meetings, of illuminations, and every form of public rejoicing.\r\nThe telegraph flashed news of similar excitement throughout the whole of\r\nthe Empire; and religious services were held wherever Englishmen are\r\nfound on the Continent, in the Colonies, and in India. If ever a\r\nrejoicing could be called national and imperial, it was this, on the\r\nThanksgiving Day for the recovery of the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe service commenced with the _Te Deum_, composed expressly for the\r\noccasion by Dr. Goss. The music of the anthem, from the words of Psalm\r\n118th, verses 14-21, and 28, was by the same composer. Among other\r\nmusical pieces was the choral hymn, \"Gotha,\" by the Prince Consort. The\r\nwhole of the service, devotional and musical, was most impressive, and\r\nthe special prayers and thanksgivings were joined in by the vast\r\ncongregation with devoutest feeling. It was noted by one who was\r\npresent, with regard to the familiar \"General Thanksgiving,\" that \"the\r\nsublimity of the service culminated, and reached its highest and\r\nintensest expression, during the silent pause which followed the\r\ninserted words: \"Particularly to Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, who\r\ndesires now to offer up his praises and thanksgiving for Thy late\r\nmercies vouchsafed to him.\"\" The famous words which close the poem of\r\nthe Seasons: \"Come then expressive silence muse His praise,\" could be\r\nwell understood in that perfect pause of a few moments, almost awful in\r\nits intensity, in the service at St. Paul's Cathedral. When the anthem\r\nhad been sung, the Archbishop of Canterbury gave a short sermon or\r\naddress, from Romans xii. 5: \"Every one members one of another.\" This\r\nwas followed by the special Thanksgiving Hymn, written by the Rev. J. S.\r\nStone, author of \"The Church's one foundation,\" and \"Sonnets of the\r\nSacred year.\" It was sung to the good and familiar tune _Aurelia_, by\r\nDr. S. Wesley. Then the Archbishop pronounced the benediction. When the\r\norgan sounded the grand notes of the National Anthem, Her Majesty came\r\nforward and bowed twice, and the Prince bowed also. The organ continued\r\nto play variations of the anthem as the Royal procession moved down the\r\nnave. Thus ended this grand and joyful service, which will be remembered\r\nin English history.\r\n\r\nAltogether it is with the utmost gratification we can look back upon\r\nthat memorable 27th of February. A demonstration more general and\r\nspontaneous has not been recorded even in the annals of this loyal\r\nnation. Among high and low, rich and poor, there was one harmonious\r\nspirit of thankful joy, in regard to the recovery of the Prince. But\r\napart from the special and personal aspect of the occasion, there was\r\nmuch to cause national gratulation. The combined feeling of religion and\r\nof loyalty showed that in this England of ours, the divine precepts:\r\n\"Fear God, Honour the King,\" are as inseparable as they are powerful,\r\nand that their influence pervades the nation, when circumstances call\r\nthem into exercise.\r\n\r\nThe words of the \"Thanksgiving Hymn\" well express the sentiment of the\r\nwhole service of the day:--\r\n\r\n    \"O Thou our soul's salvation!\r\n      Our Hope for earthly weal!\r\n    We, who in tribulation\r\n      Did for Thy mercy kneel,\r\n    Lift up glad hearts before Thee,\r\n      And eyes no longer dim,\r\n    And for Thy grace adore Thee\r\n      In eucharistic hymn.\r\n\r\n    \"Forth went the nation weeping\r\n      With precious seed of prayer,\r\n    Hope's awful vigil keeping\r\n      'Mid rumours of despair;\r\n    Then did Thy love deliver!\r\n      And from Thy gracious hand,\r\n    Joy, like the southern river,\r\n      O'erflowed the weary land.\r\n\r\n    \"Bless Thou our adoration!\r\n      Our gladness sanctify!\r\n    Make this rejoicing nation\r\n      To Thee by joy more nigh;\r\n    O be this great Thanksgiving\r\n      Throughout the land we raise,\r\n    Wrought into holier living\r\n      In all our after days!\r\n\r\n    \"Bless, Father, him Thou gavest\r\n      Back to the loyal land,\r\n    O Saviour, him Thou savest,\r\n      Still cover with Thine Hand:\r\n    O Spirit, the Defender,\r\n      Be his to guard and guide,\r\n    Now in life's midday splendour\r\n      On to the eventide!\"\r\n\r\nWhat may be the depth of the duration of the feelings thus alluded to,\r\nit is not for man to judge; but it is not as mere forms, that in tens of\r\nthousands of churches there are still uttered, week by week and day by\r\nday, prayers for the Queen, and for the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales,--expressing the faith, and the goodwill, and the loyalty, of the\r\npeople of this empire, as truly and heartily as on that special\r\nthanksgiving day in St. Paul's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORFOLK AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n_June 19th, 1872._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loyal people of King's Lynn and its neighbourhood retained pleasant\r\nremembrance of the festival time when, in 1869, the Prince and Princess\r\nof Wales came to open the new Alexandra Dock. In 1872 they were\r\ngladdened by the announcement that the Royal visitors were again coming\r\nfrom Sandringham, on the 19th June, to visit their ancient town, at the\r\nannual exhibition of the Norfolk Agricultural Society. At the east gate\r\nof Lynn the Royal carriage was met by the Mayor, who, with the Town\r\nClerk, and two leading citizens, asked permission to conduct the Prince\r\nand Princess through the town. The Earl of Leicester and Lord Sondes\r\nwere in the Royal carriage, a third carriage containing Lord Sheffield\r\nand Lady Anne Coke. At the entrance of the Show, an address was read,\r\nfrom the Norfolk Agricultural Association, to which the Prince made the\r\nfollowing reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen,--I thank you sincerely for this address. It has been\r\n    a source of the greatest gratification to have had it in my\r\n    power to contribute in any degree to the success of your\r\n    association and to promote the interests of agriculture in\r\n    Norfolk. It is with these feelings that I have endeavoured to\r\n    make myself acquainted with some of the operations of farming,\r\n    and to acquire some knowledge of stock, and if I have not always\r\n    been successful in the path of competition, I have at least\r\n    obtained prizes sufficient to encourage me to persevere, and to\r\n    indulge in the hope that I shall obtain more. The Princess is\r\n    always willing to come among you,--and to be present on\r\n    occasions like the present. We both desire to take this\r\n    opportunity of expressing the deep sense we entertain of the\r\n    sympathy and interest which were manifested towards us in our\r\n    late trials by yourselves and by every class in the county of\r\n    Norfolk.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed the inspection of the Show, and the parade of the prize\r\nanimals before the Grand Stand. The Prince was a successful exhibitor,\r\nhaving taken a second prize in Shorthorn heifers, a second prize in the\r\nclass of ponies not above thirteen hands high, a first prize for the\r\nbest Southdown ram, the second prize in Southdown ewe lambs, a second\r\nprize for ten wether lambs, two prizes (second and third) in the class\r\nof Norfolk and Suffolk red-polled cattle.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon at a banquet attended by a large number of guests, the\r\nPrince took the chair, with the Princess of Wales on his right. Grace\r\nhaving been said by the Bishop of Norwich, the toast of \"The Queen\" was\r\nreceived with enthusiasm, and the Earl of Leicester then gave \"The\r\nHealth of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the rest of the Royal\r\nFamily.\" He tendered the thanks of the society to the Prince of Wales\r\nfor the aid which he had extended to agriculture, for his liberal\r\nassistance to the local charities, for the interest which he had\r\ndisplayed in county affairs, and, last but not least, for his support to\r\nthe fox-hounds. The society was also still more indebted to Her Royal\r\nHighness the Princess of Wales for her gracious presence that evening.\r\nLadies ought always to interest themselves in their husbands' pursuits,\r\nand he believed that agriculture came quite within their province. The\r\nEarl next alluded to the illness of the Prince of Wales in December\r\nlast, and expressed his hope that His Royal Highness's life might long\r\nbe spared, as it would be devoted to the welfare of the people of\r\nEngland, and the promotion of all that was good and noble. The toast was\r\ndrunk with rounds of cheering, renewed when the Prince rose to reply.\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness said that \"he and the Princess were deeply\r\n    thankful for the reception which they had experienced during the\r\n    day. He was very glad that it had been in his power to fulfil\r\n    the promise which he gave some time since that he would preside\r\n    over the meeting. It had been a success, and he should ever\r\n    esteem it a high compliment to have been associated with it.\r\n    During the ten years in which he had lived in Norfolk, he had\r\n    endeavoured not to lag behind those other county landlords who\r\n    so ably fulfilled their duties. It would always be his earnest\r\n    endeavour to promote the welfare of the county, in which he was\r\n    much interested. He had to thank the meeting for the kind\r\n    reception which the Princess of Wales always experienced\r\n    whenever she appeared in public. It was most desirable that\r\n    ladies should associate themselves in their husbands' pursuits,\r\n    and when the Princess did not accompany him he always felt that\r\n    there was something wanting. With regard to his illness, he\r\n    should never forget the sympathy which had been extended towards\r\n    him. He accepted that sympathy as a token of the feeling of this\r\n    great and enlightened country towards himself and the Princess,\r\n    the Queen, his mother, and the Monarchical system which we had\r\n    adopted.\"\r\n\r\nAfter acknowledgment had been made by Lord Leicester, for the toast of\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant of the county, and the Bishop had responded for the\r\nClergy, the Prince rose to give what he called the toast of the evening:\r\n\"Prosperity to the Norfolk Agricultural Association.\"\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness traced \"the progress of the society and\r\n    especially the rapid advance which it had made since it adopted\r\n    the principle of holding its Shows periodically in all the towns\r\n    of the county, instead of limiting its meetings to Norwich and\r\n    Swaffham only. At the present Show there were sixty more stock\r\n    entries and one hundred more implements. Norfolk had always been\r\n    held up as a great agricultural county, and was the home of the\r\n    great nobleman, better known as 'Coke of Norfolk.' The fame of\r\n    Coke of Norfolk had not been forgotten by his son, the present\r\n    Earl of Leicester. The county was a great cattle-breeding\r\n    county, the home of such men as Lord Sondes, Mr. Brown, Mr.\r\n    Aylmer, and Mr. Overman. One other great Norfolk breeder, the\r\n    late Lord Walsingham, had passed away, but he trusted that the\r\n    present Lord Walsingham would continue to maintain the\r\n    reputation of the Merton flock.\r\n\r\n    \"His Royal Highness expressed his own great personal interest in\r\n    the Society and in the cause of agriculture generally. His late\r\n    father, the Prince Consort, always felt the greatest interest\r\n    in agriculture, and used to take his children to inspect his\r\n    prize animals. It might be desirable to increase the area of the\r\n    Society on the model of the Bath and West of England Society, by\r\n    bringing in Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, and Essex. For his own\r\n    part, he supported such an extension of the Society. A landlord\r\n    ought to feel a pride in having the working classes properly\r\n    housed on his estate. Those who worked from morning to night\r\n    should find a comfortable house, which would promote their moral\r\n    and social wellbeing. He had endeavoured to improve the cottages\r\n    on his own estate, and he felt pride and satisfaction in having\r\n    his workmen properly housed. In conclusion, His Royal Highness\r\n    strongly supported the idea of having a great county school for\r\n    Norfolk, and said it would give him the greatest pleasure to\r\n    support the enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nAfter various other toasts, the last being \"The Ladies,\" proposed by the\r\nRoyal chairman, the Prince and Princess returned to Sandringham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT GREAT YARMOUTH.\r\n\r\n_July 5th, 1872._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales visited Yarmouth on Thursday, the 5th of July, 1872,\r\nand remained till Saturday as the guest of Mr. Cuddon at\r\nShadingfield-lodge. The object of the visit was to open the New Grammar\r\nSchool, and more especially the official inspection of the Norfolk\r\nArtillery Militia, of which the Prince is Honorary Colonel. The good\r\npeople of Yarmouth, however, were resolved to make the visit a general\r\nholiday, and great preparations were made for giving a loyal and\r\nenthusiastic reception. The town was gay with decorations, and the\r\npassage through the streets was like a triumphal procession. In replying\r\nto the Address of the Mayor and Corporation, the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"It was most gratifying to me to receive in February last the\r\n    congratulations you offered me on my recovery from illness, and\r\n    my gratification is increased at having it now in my power to\r\n    thank you personally for your kindness and sympathy.\"\r\n\r\nReference was made to the same subject, in a feeling speech, in which\r\nthe Prince responded to the toast of his health, at a banquet given by\r\nthe Mayor:--\r\n\r\n    \"Allow me to thank you, Mr. Mayor, for the very kind and\r\n    touching manner in which you have proposed my health, and to\r\n    return you all my sincere thanks for the cordial manner in which\r\n    you have drunk it. I assure you it gives me more than ordinary\r\n    pleasure to be here to-day. This is the first occasion since my\r\n    return from abroad that I have met with an official reception,\r\n    and my pleasure is increased from the fact that I regard myself\r\n    as a Norfolk man. I have also to acknowledge the very high\r\n    honour conferred upon me last year in my having been appointed\r\n    Honorary Colonel of the Norfolk Militia Artillery, and to say\r\n    how glad I am to find on coming to inspect them that they have\r\n    their head-quarters at Yarmouth, for although my residence is\r\n    not very near you, still you will believe me when I assure you\r\n    that I entertain the same sentiments with regard to your borough\r\n    of Great Yarmouth as I do towards Lynn, and all the other towns\r\n    of Norfolk. I have also again to thank you for your sympathy\r\n    during my illness. It is difficult for me now to speak upon that\r\n    subject, but as it has pleased Almighty God to preserve me to my\r\n    country I hope I may not be ungrateful for the feeling which has\r\n    been shown towards me, and that I may do all that I can to be of\r\n    use to my countrymen. I will not detain you much longer, but\r\n    before sitting down it affords me great pleasure to propose to\r\n    you a toast which I am sure you will all drink most heartily,\r\n    and that is the health of the Mayor. I regard him as the\r\n    representative of the people of Yarmouth, and tender to him my\r\n    warmest thanks for the cordial and impressive welcome I have\r\n    received. I feel convinced that, although my stay among you will\r\n    unfortunately be short, it will be agreeable; and I trust that\r\n    the sun which shines so brilliantly at present will continue to\r\n    favour us during the next two days.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness was loudly cheered throughout his speech, especially\r\nupon his declaration that he was a Norfolk man, and still more so upon\r\nreferring to his recovery.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor having responded, the Prince rose and proceeded to his\r\ncarriage, and drove at a slow pace by a circuitous route through the\r\ntown and along the Marine Parade to the Grammar School. Here he was\r\nreceived by the Head Master, and an Address was presented by Sir Edmund\r\nLacon, Chairman of the Trustees of the School, to which the Prince\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you sincerely for the expressions of your kind feeling\r\n    at my recovery. It is a source of the greatest satisfaction to\r\n    me to have an opportunity of assisting, in whatever form it may\r\n    be, in the great work of education. It is gratifying to see the\r\n    schools of Edward VI. revived and devoted to the purpose for\r\n    which they were founded, and those who are actively engaged in\r\n    the work deserve the hearty thanks of the people to whom they\r\n    extend the benefit which a practical religious education always\r\n    confers. Success tells its own tale, and the numbers of the boys\r\n    present in the school, together with those whom you expect to be\r\n    added to it, enable me to congratulate the people of Yarmouth on\r\n    your having revived an institution so calculated to promote\r\n    their best interests.\"\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness then declared the school open, and, with the\r\n    permission of the authorities, prayed that the boys be granted\r\n    an extra week's holiday at Midsummer in remembrance of his\r\n    visit.\r\n\r\nOn the next day the Prince made the official inspection of the\r\nArtillery; afterwards dining with the officers of his regiment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales being Colonel of the Norfolk Artillery Militia, has\r\noccasion to visit Great Yarmouth more frequently than he might otherwise\r\ndo. At the time of the inspection in 1887, advantage was taken of his\r\npresence for laying the foundation of the new hospital, the old one\r\nhaving been in use since 1838, and being too small, and unsuitable for\r\nthe increased requirements of the borough. The foundation stone of the\r\nnew edifice was laid with masonic ceremony on the 18th of May, 1887. The\r\nPrince was accompanied by Lord Charles Beresford, and a large muster of\r\nthe brethren of the Craft assembled to meet the Grand Master. An\r\nimposing procession proceeded from the Town Hall to the site of the\r\nHospital. The crowds in the streets were great, and the ceremony excited\r\nmuch interest in the town. To an address from the Corporation, the\r\nPrince replied in gracious terms; expressing his gratification at being\r\nable again to visit the ancient borough, and to assist in so good a\r\nwork; adding, that though it was his sixth visit, he hoped it would not\r\nbe the last, as he always looked forward with the greatest pleasure to\r\ncoming to Great Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL DRILL REVIEW.\r\n\r\n_July 25th, 1872._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Horticultural Gardens at South Kensington had seen many\r\nvicissitudes, and been turned to many uses, before it ceased to be the\r\nhead-quarters of the science and art of gardening. But the ground was\r\nnever turned to better use than when it was lent for the Annual Review\r\nof the thousands of boys belonging to the Training Ships and the Pauper\r\nSchools of the Metropolitan District Unions. Two of these annual reviews\r\nhad been held, under the auspices of the Society of Arts, when in 1872,\r\non the 25th of July, the Prince of Wales was asked, as President of that\r\nSociety, to take the leading part in the proceedings of the day.\r\n\r\nAbout 4000 boys in all mustered, each little regiment marching on the\r\nground with its own band playing and banner flying. The Greenwich Royal\r\nNaval School, of 700 boys, were conspicuous in their nest sailor\r\nuniforms. The lads of the _Warspite_, _Goliath_, and _Chichester_\r\ntraining ships also made a good appearance. The Greenwich boys, having\r\nthe advantage of more thorough training and instruction, were excluded\r\nfrom the competition in the drill exercises for which other schools\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nPrince Edward of Saxe-Weimar watched each school at drill under its own\r\ninspector, and adjudged the prizes to be afterwards distributed by the\r\nPrince of Wales. A Serjeant-major of the Guards was in charge of the\r\nparade, and of the march past the saluting point. The arrangements of\r\nthe day had been chiefly organized by Major Donelly, R.E., to whom great\r\npraise was due.\r\n\r\nThe boys had been at work for some hours, when at 4 P.M., the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales arrived on the ground, accompanied by their two eldest\r\nboys in sailors' costume. The prizes were distributed in the Royal\r\nAlbert Hall. The Princess went to the Royal box, but the Royal princes\r\nwent with their father to the daïs, where they were welcomed with great\r\nclapping of hands, by the thousands of boys, and the thousand adult\r\nspectators of the scene. Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar had adjudged the\r\nfirst prize to the boys of the _Goliath_; the second to the boys of the\r\nShoreditch School at Brentford; and the third to the Lambeth School at\r\nLower Norwood.\r\n\r\nAfter a short address by General Sir Eardley Wilmot, speaking in the\r\nname of the Council of the Society of Arts,--\r\n\r\n    The Prince of Wales rose, and in an excellent impromptu speech\r\n    \"assured the members of the Council and the boys (addressing the\r\n    latter in kindly way as 'you, my young friends'), of the\r\n    pleasure it gave the Princess, his two sons, and himself to be\r\n    present. Congratulating the schools on their excellent marching,\r\n    and on the favourable report just read, His Royal Highness added\r\n    that he hoped the boys had been up to the mark in their studies\r\n    as well as their drill.\"\r\n\r\nTwo boys of each prize school came in succession to the daïs, and\r\nreceived the prize banners from the Prince's hand. The Prince and his\r\nsons then joined the Princess in her box, and it was a striking scene\r\nwhen, after some bars of prelude, the words of 'God Bless the Prince of\r\nWales' were taken up by a thousand young and clear voices, the Prince\r\nand Princess and the two lads standing in the front of the box while it\r\nwas sung. The last of the programme was then fulfilled by the bands\r\nplaying a selection of music.\r\n\r\nThe sight altogether was most gratifying. Here were 4000 boys, most of\r\nthem paupers, many of them orphans, receiving an excellent education, a\r\ntraining in physical aptitudes and habits of obedience as well as in\r\nmental studies. The Greenwich School is composed of the children of\r\nseamen being educated for the sea, but the three thousand and more boys\r\nof the other schools must in large part be looked upon as so much\r\nmaterial reclaimed to humanity. In fact, these three thousand and more\r\nboys may, in the words of a paper put forth by the Society of Arts, \"be\r\nbeheld with confident satisfaction as victims rescued from 'the bad,'\r\nand preserved for the good as honest, self-supporting producers, and\r\nworthy members of the community.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEYMOUTH AND THE PORTLAND BREAKWATER.\r\n\r\n_August 11th, 1872._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of August, 1872, the Prince of Wales went from Osborne in\r\nthe Royal yacht _Victoria and Albert_, to inaugurate the completed\r\nBreakwater and Harbour of Refuge at Portland, and to pay a visit to\r\nWeymouth, the favourite resort of the Prince's great-grandfather, George\r\nIII. A magnificent fleet of ironclads, headed by the _Minotaur_, bearing\r\nthe flag of Admiral Hornby, and many other vessels, were in attendance\r\nfor the ceremony, of which fifteen were first-rate ironclad ships of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe weather was stormy, and the sea had been too disturbed for the\r\ncomfort of the Civil Lords of the Admiralty; but the Prince showed no\r\nsigns of suffering from the rough voyage, and manfully went through the\r\nproceedings of the day. The stone being laid, prayers were said by a\r\nclergyman, plaster was spread on the surface on which the last of seven\r\nmillion tons of Portland stone was to find a firm resting-place, the\r\nusual glass bottle containing newspapers, coins, and a chart of the\r\nisland and the breakwater was laid in the groove prepared, and, when the\r\nPrince himself had spread some mortar, the great block was lowered into\r\nits place. His Royal Highness then struck three blows upon it with an\r\nivory mallet, tested it with a silver level, and completed a very short\r\nbut sufficient ceremony, by saying, \"I now declare this stone to be well\r\nand truly laid and this great work to be complete.\" At the concerted\r\nsignal of a lowered colour, the guns of the fort began to fire a salute,\r\nand the spectators raised a cheer. The inscription on the stone read as\r\nfollows, the concluding quotation having been added, it is stated, by\r\nthe Prince himself:--\r\n\r\n    \"From this spot, on the 25th of July, 1849, His Royal Highness\r\n    Prince Albert, Consort of Queen Victoria, deposited the first\r\n    stone of this breakwater. Upon the same spot, on the 10th of\r\n    August, 1872, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, laid this last\r\n    stone, and declared the work complete.\"\r\n\r\n        \"'These are imperial works, and worthy Kings.'\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the ceremony the Royal yacht steamed towards\r\nWeymouth, and after a rather uncomfortable passage, through a\r\nchoppy sea and over the bar, in the Royal barge, the Prince landed\r\nat the end of the pier. Here the Mayor and Corporation presented\r\nan address, which declared that \"His Royal Highness had added\r\none more link to the golden chain of favours already conferred by\r\nRoyalty on this ancient borough.\" A luncheon was given by\r\nMr. Hambro, the senior member for Weymouth. The streets were\r\ngaily decorated, and the people were loud in their loyal and joyful\r\ndemonstrations. The Royal yacht returned to Osborne late in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO DERBY.\r\n\r\n_December 17th, 1872._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tidings that the Prince and Princess of Wales were coming to Derby\r\nfrom Chatsworth, where they were on a visit to the Duke of Devonshire,\r\ncaused great excitement in the district. Trains brought crowds from\r\nBirmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Nottingham, and Chesterfield, to\r\nswell the populace of Derby.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 17th of December, 1872, not far from the anniversary of\r\nthe gloomiest time of the illness of the previous year, that the visit\r\nto Derby was made. There were several loyal addresses--from civic,\r\nmunicipal, and other bodies, including one from the Freemasons of\r\nDerbyshire. The object of the Royal visit was mainly to present the\r\nprizes at the Derby Grammar School, one of the most flourishing of\r\nprovincial middle-class schools. The procession of carriages passed\r\nthrough streets crowded with people, with brilliant escort of troops,\r\nand decorations everywhere on the route. On arriving at the school Lord\r\nBelper delivered an address referring to the foundation and history of\r\nthe institution, and the high scholastic standard aimed at. The Head\r\nMaster, the Rev. W. Clark, having thanked the Prince and the Princess\r\nfor coming, added that His Royal Highness had kindly said he would write\r\nhis name in each of the prize-books in remembrance of the occasion:--\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness, on rising, said,--\"Mr. Clark, Ladies, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--I beg you to accept from the Princess, as well as\r\n    myself, our cordial thanks for the very kind words that have\r\n    been addressed to us. I can assure you that I have come here\r\n    with feelings of the greatest pleasure, and we are glad we\r\n    accepted the kind invitation of the noble duke to visit\r\n    Chatsworth, and that we have had the pleasure and advantage of\r\n    visiting the ancient town of Derby. I have had great pleasure in\r\n    presiding to-day and distributing the prizes to the successful\r\n    competitors of the Derby school. This school, as you know, is\r\n    one of the oldest in the kingdom, though I am afraid one of the\r\n    poorest endowed. Still it has always borne the highest\r\n    reputation, which I feel convinced it will continue to maintain.\r\n    To the young men to whom I have had the pleasure of distributing\r\n    prizes allow me to offer my most hearty congratulations, and I\r\n    trust they may continue to go on as they are doing now. If they\r\n    do so they will be successful in whatever profession they enter.\r\n    I will not detain you longer, but thank you once more for the\r\n    kind reception you have given us this day, and also tender to\r\n    the Mayor our cordial thanks for the hearty reception we have\r\n    received in our progress through Derby.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the invitation to Derby was first suggested by the\r\nTrustees of the Grammar School, who in their petition, sent to\r\nChatsworth, represented that this school, reputed to be one of the\r\noldest in the kingdom, was also one of the most poorly endowed. This was\r\nan appeal which at once secured the goodwill of the Prince. Nor has he\r\nforgotten the school. On the 14th of November, 1888, he went to see \"the\r\nPrince of Wales's Class Rooms,\" erected as a memorial of his visit in\r\n1872. In response to a petition presented by the captain of the school,\r\nthe Prince obtained from the Head Master a promise of making November 14\r\na perpetual holiday in remembrance of this visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY BENEVOLENT INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n_March 27th, 1873._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of March 27, 1873, His Royal Highness the Prince of\r\nWales, who had in the morning visited several artists' studios, and in\r\nthe afternoon went to the House of Lords, presided at the annual dinner\r\nin aid of the Railway Benevolent Institution, at Willis's Rooms. After\r\ndinner and grace the Royal Chairman gave the usual first toast, the\r\nhealth of Her Majesty the Queen, Patroness of the Railway Benevolent\r\nInstitution. The Duke of Buckingham then proposed the health of the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales; and in so doing took occasion to say that\r\nit was not the first time His Royal Highness had taken interest in the\r\nInstitution, and now he had done it the honour to preside at its annual\r\nfestival. The toast being duly welcomed, the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--Although it is very unusual on a\r\n    public occasion of this kind for the health of the Chairman to\r\n    be given so early in the evening, yet mine has been proposed so\r\n    kindly by the noble Duke and so well received, and has,\r\n    moreover, been so kindly coupled with that of the Princess and\r\n    the rest of my family, that I think it my duty to rise at once\r\n    and respond to the toast. The noble Duke has been kind enough to\r\n    say that my family and myself do what we can for the support of\r\n    the great charitable Institutions of the country. I am very much\r\n    flattered by those remarks. I can only assure you--and I think I\r\n    may speak for the other members of my family--that it is one of\r\n    our chief objects to come forward as often as we possibly can in\r\n    support of Institutions which are so beneficial and so necessary\r\n    to the well-being of the country, and which are always so\r\n    munificently supported by all classes of the community. I thank\r\n    you once more for the honour you have done me, and assure you\r\n    that it is a great pleasure and gratification to me to take the\r\n    chair here this evening.\"\r\n\r\nOther toasts being proposed and acknowledged, the Prince rose and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--The toast I have now the honour to\r\n    propose is a bumper toast, and I know it will be received as\r\n    such. It is that of 'Prosperity to the Railway Benevolent\r\n    Institution and Board of Management.' When I look around me\r\n    this evening and see how numerous is the assemblage before me, I\r\n    feel convinced that you have come here intending to do honour to\r\n    that toast, and to do your utmost in every way to support the\r\n    Institution which to-day has reached its fifteenth anniversary.\r\n    It is difficult for me, especially before you, who are so well\r\n    acquainted with the merits of the Institution, to say anything\r\n    new concerning it. Still I think it my duty, as your chairman,\r\n    to mention a few facts by way of an appeal to your\r\n    consideration.\r\n\r\n    \"The objects of the Railway Benevolent Institution may be\r\n    briefly mentioned under six heads. First, it has for its object\r\n    the granting of annuities of from £10 to £25 to the distressed\r\n    railway officers and servants incapacitated through age,\r\n    sickness, or accident; second, to grant small pensions to\r\n    distressed widows; third, to educate and maintain orphan\r\n    children; fourth, to grant temporary relief until permanent\r\n    relief can be afforded; fifth, to induce railway officers and\r\n    servants to insure their lives by dividing the payment of the\r\n    premium into small periodical sums, and by granting a\r\n    reversionary bonus of 10 per cent. out of the funds of the\r\n    institution; sixth and lastly, to grant small sums not exceeding\r\n    £10 to the families of those who are injured or killed in the\r\n    performance of their duties.\r\n\r\n    \"When I look at the list before me I must say it is indeed a sad\r\n    one; but at the same time it must be a gratification to us, who\r\n    wish well to the Institution, to see that from the 16th of\r\n    November, 1871, to the 16th of November last as many as 1067\r\n    cases were relieved out of the casualty fund. I may also mention\r\n    that the officers of the railway companies subscribe half a\r\n    guinea and the servants 8_s._ a year. In fact, I may say that\r\n    the railway companies give this Institution in every way their\r\n    official support, and they may indeed well do so, because there\r\n    is no institution which more heartily deserves our support than\r\n    this.\r\n\r\n    \"There is, however, one curious fact which I should like to\r\n    mention. I believe I am correct in saying that the number of\r\n    officers and servants employed on railways in the United Kingdom\r\n    amounts to something like 300,000, but only 35,000 of them are\r\n    subscribers; and in Ireland there is not a single subscriber. I\r\n    am sorry to have to make this fact known; but all the more\r\n    reason is there that we this evening should be liberal with our\r\n    purses, as I am sure we shall all be when we consider how often\r\n    we travel by railway. Not a day goes by but most of you travel\r\n    once--probably twice. In stepping into a railway carriage, do\r\n    you not think of the risks you may run? An accident may happen\r\n    to anybody, though every possible security and guarantee may be\r\n    given that no accident shall occur.\r\n\r\n    \"Well, if we as passengers run risks, how much more so the\r\n    officers and servants of the companies; and that not every day,\r\n    but every hour and minute of their lives? We may be sure it is\r\n    the earnest desire of the managers and directors--many of whom\r\n    are here this evening--to do all in their power to guarantee the\r\n    safety of the passengers and of those to whom are entrusted the\r\n    care and management of the trains. I feel sure I cannot impress\r\n    on them too strongly the necessity for their still using every\r\n    effort in their power to prevent accidents, which are,\r\n    unfortunately, too frequent. It is not for me in the presence of\r\n    so many great railway authorities to say what plan may be best\r\n    devised to lessen accidents--whether it may be that there are\r\n    too many railways, whether the immense network which exists in\r\n    this country comes too closely together at different stations,\r\n    or the trains follow each other at intervals too short. These\r\n    are questions with which I do not feel myself competent to deal;\r\n    but at the same time I feel that the question of railways, and\r\n    especially the frequency of accidents, are brought more\r\n    distinctly under our notice when we consider the claims of the\r\n    Institution we are brought together this evening to promote.\r\n    This is a theme about which one might talk for a long time; and\r\n    I know, on occasions of this kind, it would be out of place on\r\n    my part to give you a long oration; yet, though I but feebly\r\n    express what others would much better have laid before you, I\r\n    hope you will believe that nobody feels more deeply for this\r\n    Institution than I do, that nobody advocates its claims more\r\n    ardently than I, and nobody will continue to take a greater\r\n    interest in everything connected with our great railways.\r\n\r\n    \"To show you that I am not using mere stereotyped phrases, I may\r\n    tell you that no week elapses without my travelling once or\r\n    twice at least by train. I have therefore the opportunity of\r\n    seeing, as well as anybody can see, how admirably our railway\r\n    system is worked; not only the managers and directors, but the\r\n    officers and servants have my warmest admiration for doing their\r\n    utmost in the execution of their duty, and also for their\r\n    unvarying courtesy and attention. I will now ask you once more,\r\n    in conclusion, to open your purses as freely as you can in\r\n    support of the Railway Benevolent Institution.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary afterwards announced subscriptions to the handsome amount\r\nof £5000, which included a second donation by His Royal Highness of 100\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNVEILING THE ALBERT STATUE ON HOLBORN\r\nVIADUCT.\r\n\r\n_January 9th, 1874._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of January, 1874, the Prince of Wales visited the City for\r\nunveiling the equestrian statue erected at the western entrance of the\r\nHolborn Viaduct, in memory of the late Prince Consort. At the site an\r\naddress was read, containing a description of the memorial, and an\r\naccount of its origin. The ceremony of unveiling over, the Prince was\r\ndriven in the state carriage of the Lord Mayor to the Guildhall, where\r\nbetween 700 and 800 guests, including many distinguished persons, were\r\ninvited to luncheon. After the first loyal toast, \"The Queen,\" had been\r\nreceived with all honours, the Lord Mayor said: \"I now raise my glass to\r\nthe memory of the late Prince Consort. 'He being dead yet speaketh.'\"\r\nThe words were spoken with emotion, and the company rising in a body,\r\ndrank the toast in silence and with every mark of respect.\r\n\r\nThe health of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the other members of\r\nthe Royal Family--including the Duke of Cambridge, who was\r\npresent--having been given, the Prince responded.\r\n\r\nHe expressed his grateful sense of the cordiality of his reception, and\r\nthe satisfaction he had in coming for such a purpose as the inauguration\r\nand unveiling of a statue to his lamented father. He also acknowledged\r\nthe debt of thanks to the donor of the statue, whose name he knew, but\r\nwho wished it not to be made public. \"To the Corporation of London I\r\nhave to express my thanks for having contributed a part of the\r\nstatue--namely, the pedestal; and I am sure that the work which we have\r\ninaugurated to-day will long be an ornament to the City of London.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH ORPHAN ASYLUM FESTIVAL.\r\n\r\n_March 25th, 1874._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of institutions for helping fatherless and orphan children is\r\nconsiderable, but the purpose of the British Orphan Asylum, at Slough,\r\nis distinct from most charities of the class. The orphan children here\r\nadmitted are the sons and daughters of persons once in prosperous\r\ncircumstances, but who have been unable to make provision for their\r\nfamilies. Clergymen, naval and military officers, members of the legal\r\nand medical profession, are often in this position. Commercial men are\r\nalso liable to sudden misfortune, and children are afterwards left in\r\npoverty, who were once accustomed to ease and prosperity. The frequency\r\nof such cases led to the establishment, in 1827, of a special Asylum for\r\nthe orphans of such persons. The honorary secretary at present is the\r\nRev. Canon James Fleming, whose name is alone sufficient guarantee for\r\nthe excellent object and good management of the Asylum.\r\n\r\nAt the anniversary festival, in 1874, held at Willis's Rooms, on March\r\n25th, the Prince of Wales presided. After the toast of \"The Queen,\"\r\nproposed by the Chairman, the Marquis of Hertford gave the health of\r\n\"The Prince of Wales, the Princess of Wales, and the rest of the Royal\r\nFamily,\" among whom was now included the Duchess of Edinburgh. The\r\nMarquis said: \"It gives us all the greatest pleasure to see His Royal\r\nHighness again among us as one of the Royal Family taking part in the\r\nsacred cause of charity. We who belong to the British Orphan Asylum have\r\nthe greatest reason to be pleased and thankful to His Royal Highness for\r\nhaving come among us this evening.\"\r\n\r\nOther toasts having been disposed of, the Prince rose and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is now my duty, as your Chairman, to call upon you to drink\r\n    the toast of 'Prosperity to the British Orphan Asylum.' I am\r\n    satisfied you will do so most heartily, when I see around me so\r\n    numerous an assembly prepared to do honour to the occasion, and\r\n    to assist us in our work. I feel some diffidence in proposing\r\n    this toast in the presence of so many who know far better than I\r\n    do the excellence of this institution, and understand its\r\n    working. At the same time it gives me the greatest pleasure to\r\n    propose the toast, and to be here this evening advocating so\r\n    excellent a cause. It is always a pleasure to advocate the cause\r\n    of charity, and there is no other appeal that comes so home to\r\n    the hearts of all classes of the community.\r\n\r\n    \"I have a special interest in this Asylum. It is now nearly\r\n    eleven years since the Princess and myself visited and\r\n    inaugurated the present building near Slough; and when I pass by\r\n    Slough, as I frequently have to do in the course of the year, it\r\n    always gives me pleasure to look at that building, and to think\r\n    how many children are here provided for and educated. It is now\r\n    very nearly half a century since this institution was founded,\r\n    and it is different from all others in this respect, that\r\n    children of parents who were once in prosperous circumstances\r\n    are there educated. In it there are children of officers of the\r\n    Army, of the legal, medical, and naval professions, and the\r\n    proof of its usefulness is that after they have grown up they\r\n    frequently write letters to the managers of the Asylum\r\n    expressing their gratitude for the excellence of the practical\r\n    education they have received, and which has been so profitable\r\n    to them in their different avocations.\r\n\r\n    \"To show how prosperous this Asylum is, I may state that in\r\n    January last it contained within four of 200 children. You will\r\n    perhaps ask, if this institution is in so prosperous a\r\n    condition, why have this dinner? Why call so many people\r\n    together? And why am I to ask you, in as civil a manner as I\r\n    possibly can, to subscribe towards its support? My answer is,\r\n    that the net income of the Asylum is £3000 a year, but that the\r\n    increase in prices of all the necessaries of life is so\r\n    enormous, that to meet the deficiency that exists as much as\r\n    £1500 has been sold out of their funds; and I feel that in order\r\n    to make that deficiency good, I shall not call upon you this\r\n    evening in vain. There are points which I might bring before\r\n    your notice, but I think that on this occasion brevity is best,\r\n    for you all know what a good institution it is, and I am sure\r\n    you will drink with me 'Prosperity to the Institution,' and try\r\n    to make it still more prosperous for the future. I beg to couple\r\n    with the toast the health of the treasurer, the directors, the\r\n    hon. secretaries, and medical officers of the institution.\"\r\n\r\nThe subscriptions announced during the evening amounted to upwards of\r\n£2400.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANQUET TO SIR GARNET WOLSELEY.\r\n\r\n_March 31st, 1874._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor of London, as chief magistrate of the City, has always\r\nbeen ready to honour men distinguished for naval and military service\r\nrendered to the country. A grand State Banquet was given on the 31st of\r\nMarch, 1874, to Lord Wolseley, then Major-General Sir Garnet Wolseley,\r\non his return to England after the triumphant Ashantee Expedition. The\r\ndinner was served in the Egyptian Hall at the Mansion House. Covers were\r\nlaid for 260 guests, among whom were His Royal Highness the Prince of\r\nWales, Prince Arthur, and the Duke of Cambridge. All the officers of the\r\nStaff, and others who had taken part in the Expedition, with many\r\neminent persons in civic or official life, were present.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor, having given the usual loyal toasts, the Prince of Wales\r\nrose to respond to that of the Royal Family, saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Mayor, your Royal Highness, my Lords, Ladies, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--I beg to tender you my very warmest thanks for the\r\n    kind way in which the Lord Mayor proposed this toast, and for\r\n    the cordial manner in which the company now assembled have\r\n    received it. This is not the first time I have had the honour of\r\n    an invitation to be present at the Mansion House and receive the\r\n    hospitality of the Lord Mayor of the City of London. But I can\r\n    assure him that however much pleased I may have been to be\r\n    present on former occasions, on no occasion did it afford me\r\n    greater pleasure to be here than on this evening, when he has\r\n    given a banquet to welcome back those gallant officers who have\r\n    so lately returned from the Gold Coast to England. The gallant\r\n    officers and men of that Expedition had the opportunity\r\n    yesterday of seeing the Queen, and the Queen had the opportunity\r\n    of seeing them, and of expressing her approval of everything\r\n    that has occurred. Yesterday afternoon, also, both Houses of\r\n    Parliament unanimously accorded a vote of thanks for the manner\r\n    in which that difficult though short campaign was conducted.\r\n    This evening, again, the Lord Mayor takes the opportunity of\r\n    welcoming those gentlemen who are here as the representatives of\r\n    the troops that formed that Expedition, in the hospitable manner\r\n    which is so well known in this Hall. On a question of this kind\r\n    it would be unbecoming in me and out of place to make any\r\n    remarks with regard to that Expedition which has been so\r\n    successfully closed. But I cannot sit down without taking the\r\n    opportunity of saying how much I rejoice--if I may say so as a\r\n    soldier and a comrade of those I see around me--that this\r\n    Expedition has ended in so successful a manner. English officers\r\n    and English troops have kept up their reputation. They have not\r\n    only displayed great courage--that they have done on all\r\n    occasions--but they displayed extraordinary endurance, owing to\r\n    the fearful climate and country they had to contend with. I am\r\n    glad to have the opportunity of welcoming home the gallant\r\n    General on my right, and congratulating him on the great success\r\n    of his expedition. Once more I thank you for the honour you have\r\n    done me in drinking my health, and on the part of the members of\r\n    my family, for the kind way in which you have spoken of them.\"\r\n\r\nIn responding to the toast of \"The Army and Navy,\" the Duke of Cambridge\r\nreferred to the review of the troops of the Expedition on the previous\r\nday, at Windsor, before the Queen. \"The distinguished officer who\r\nconducted this war knew the task he undertook, and how to undertake it;\r\nand he was well backed by the officers and men placed at his disposal.\"\r\nThe speech of Sir Garnet Wolseley was admirable in tone and feeling, and\r\nwith clear soldier-like statement of the chief events and results of the\r\nExpedition. He thus concluded: \"The military world has learnt many\r\nmilitary lessons in recent years, but the most valuable to us as a\r\nnation that has been taught us by the Abyssinian and Ashantee Wars is\r\nthat when you have to appoint an English General to command any military\r\nundertaking it is necessary to trust him; to supply him with all he asks\r\nfor; and, above all things, to avoid the error of severing the military\r\ncommand from the diplomacy necessarily connected with the operations. I\r\nhave no hesitation in saying that had my operations been encumbered by\r\nthe presence with me of a Civil Governor, or of an Ambassador authorised\r\nto give me orders, I do not think I should ever have reached Coomassie.\r\nUpon my arrival at Cape Coast Castle, at the beginning of last October,\r\nI found it in a state of siege. A large Ashantee army threatened both it\r\nand Elmina; a panic and demoralisation had seized upon all classes; the\r\npeople from the surrounding districts had flooded into the towns on the\r\nCoast, where they soon suffered from disease, owing to their crowded\r\ncondition; trade had almost ceased altogether, and a large proportion of\r\nthe people depended upon the Government for their support. When I left\r\nCape Coast Castle, at the beginning of this month, I left there a\r\nprosperous population, enjoying the blessings of peace and the\r\nmercantile advantages attendant thereon. I found upon my arrival on the\r\nCoast the _prestige_ of England at its lowest ebb, but before I\r\ndeparted, I left our military fame firmly established on a secure base,\r\nconsequent on the victories so gallantly won by the troops under my\r\ncommand. My Lord Mayor, I have to thank you most sincerely for the\r\nmanner in which you have alluded to me personally and to my military\r\nservices, and I have to thank you, in the name of all ranks composing\r\nthe expeditionary force, for the warm reception and the noble\r\nhospitality you have accorded to us this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL MEDICAL BENEVOLENT COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n_April 22nd, 1874._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Medical Benevolent College, at Epsom, was founded in 1851, for\r\nthe education of sons of medical men. There are at present about two\r\nhundred boys, fifty of whom, on the foundation, are educated, boarded,\r\nand entirely maintained at the expense of the institution. The education\r\nis of the highest class, and the charge, to those not on the foundation,\r\nis fifty guineas, if the pupils are above fourteen, with slight\r\nreduction for those under that age. There is accommodation in the\r\nCollege for twenty-four pensioners, who have comfortable quarters, and a\r\npension of twenty guineas a year. There are also twenty-six non-resident\r\npensioners, with the same annuity of twenty guineas.\r\n\r\nIn support of the funds of the College, the eighteenth festival, at\r\nWillis's Rooms, was presided over by the Prince of Wales, supported by\r\nthe Duke of Teck, Earl Granville, as President of the College, and a\r\nlarge number of the leading men of the profession. The usual loyal and\r\npatriotic toasts having been given, the Royal Chairman gave the toast of\r\nthe evening, saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--I feel both some difficulty and some\r\n    diffidence in proposing the toast of 'Success to the Royal\r\n    Medical College,' because, in the first place, I wish the task\r\n    had fallen into abler hands than mine, and, in the second place,\r\n    many of you must in any event know more upon the subject than I\r\n    do. It may not be out of place, however, on this occasion for me\r\n    to give you a few statistics connected with the Royal Medical\r\n    College. No doubt many of you will be well up in the subject,\r\n    but others will be reminded or informed. This College was\r\n    founded by Mr. Propert, a medical gentleman of high eminence;\r\n    and its object is, in the first place, to assist aged medical\r\n    men and the widows of qualified practitioners, and, in the next\r\n    place, to educate the children of such persons. In 1853 the\r\n    first stone was laid at Epsom; in 1855 the institution was\r\n    opened by my lamented father, who took the deepest interest in\r\n    its welfare; and I had the opportunity, as a boy, of\r\n    accompanying him on that occasion. I have therefore been\r\n    acquainted with the institution, which we have come here to do\r\n    honour to, for nineteen years. There were then five pensioners'\r\n    houses and a school for 150 boys. There are now, including the\r\n    three about to be elected, fifty pensioners, each of whom\r\n    receives £21 a year, and twenty-four of whom are also resident\r\n    in the College. The school contains 200 resident pupils, the\r\n    sons of medical men, fifty of whom, being foundation scholars,\r\n    are educated, boarded, clothed, and maintained at the expense of\r\n    the institution, while the remainder are charged from £48 to £51\r\n    a year.\r\n\r\n    \"A gentleman who is present (Sir Erasmus Wilson) has just built\r\n    a house to hold forty more boys. I offer him our sincere thanks\r\n    for the great benefit he has conferred upon the institution. The\r\n    school has always been full, but we are anxious to increase its\r\n    funds, and, as each foundationer costs £60 a year, you will see\r\n    that we want money.\r\n\r\n    \"It will not be out of place for me to remind you what a\r\n    difficult profession is that of medicine--what uphill work it is\r\n    to some, unlike those whom I see around. Some who would have\r\n    attained high positions may be struck down by illness or by some\r\n    great sorrow, and for them provision should be made. There is\r\n    also the case of the eminent man making a large income, but cut\r\n    off suddenly, before he has made provision for a wife and family\r\n    now left destitute, though the husband and father may have led a\r\n    life of usefulness in his profession. Our object is not to make\r\n    long speeches, nor, I hope, to bore any of those who are\r\n    assembled here, but you may be assured that, however imperfectly\r\n    I may have spoken, what I have said I mean most heartily, and\r\n    when I call upon you this evening to give your support--your\r\n    liberal support--to this charity I feel sure I shall not call in\r\n    vain. I now propose 'Success to the Royal Medical Benevolent\r\n    College.'\"\r\n\r\nThe subscriptions and donations announced by the secretary amounted to\r\n£1780, the list being headed by the Prince of Wales with 100 guineas.\r\n\r\nSir James Paget, in proposing the health of the president, officers, and\r\nmembers of the Council of the College, said that they were to be\r\ncongratulated on the prospects of the institution, and on their having\r\n\"induced His Royal Highness to leave Sandringham at this season, to add\r\ngrace and dignity to the celebration of the twenty-first year of the\r\nCollege.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, it may be added, besides his kindly interest in all\r\ncharitable institutions, has uniformly shown courtesy and respect to the\r\nmedical profession, members of which he has from early life honoured\r\nwith his personal friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE MIDDLE AND THE INNER TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n_June 11th, 1874._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the opening of the new Library in 1862, His Royal Highness the Prince\r\nof Wales was made a Bencher of the Middle Temple. On the 11th of June,\r\n1874, the Treasurer and Benchers of the Middle Temple entertained the\r\nmembers of the Inn, and a large number of distinguished guests, at\r\ndinner, according to ancient custom, on \"the great grand day\" of Trinity\r\nTerm. The Prince of Wales, being a Bencher, was present not as a guest,\r\nbut as one of the hosts, in the grand old historical Hall. This Hall,\r\nthe erection of which commenced in 1562, was completed in 1572, and is\r\none of the most famous relics of old London. This was the second time of\r\nthe Prince of Wales visiting it. On three prior occasions, at least, it\r\nhas been visited by Royalty--namely, by Queen Henrietta, the consort of\r\nCharles I., Peter the Great of Russia, and William III. There is also a\r\ntradition of the Inn that Queen Elizabeth was present at a rehearsal\r\nthere of the _Midsummer Night's Dream_, in which Shakespeare himself\r\ntook part, and that in the course of the revel Her Majesty danced with\r\nher Chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton. The splendid oak screen and\r\nmusic gallery at the eastern end were erected in 1572. The Hall is\r\ngraced by one of the three genuine paintings by Vandyck of Charles\r\nI.--the other two being at Windsor and Warwick Castles--and by portraits\r\nof Charles II., James II., William III., Queen Anne, and George III. A\r\nbust of the Prince of Wales is also conspicuous, and a portrait of His\r\nRoyal Highness, by Mr. Watts R.A., has since been added.\r\n\r\nThe Treasurer, Mr. Runyon, Q.C., presided at the dinner, when no less\r\nthan 430 members of the Inn, Benchers, Barristers, or Students were\r\npresent, and many illustrious guests. On the right of the chair was the\r\nMaster of the Temple (the Rev. Dr. Vaughan), and next to him the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury; on the left the Prince of Wales, and next to\r\nhim the Lord Chief Justice. The Prince wore the silk gown of a Queen's\r\nCounsel, and the riband of the Garter. On his health being proposed,\r\nafter that of the Queen, it was to give \"respectful and hearty welcome\r\nto Master His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince on rising to respond was loudly cheered, and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Master Treasurer, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I beg to tender to\r\n    you and to my brother Benchers my sincere thanks for the kind,\r\n    hearty, and cordial manner in which you have received this\r\n    toast. I cannot feel that I am quite a stranger among you,\r\n    although it is now nearly thirteen years since I had the honour\r\n    of being enrolled as a member of this Inn. My relations with you\r\n    are, unfortunately, of an almost entirely honorary character,\r\n    but I can assure you that I consider it a very high honour to be\r\n    connected with this Inn. It is, I am sure, a good thing for the\r\n    profession at large and for the public in general that I have\r\n    never been called to the Bar, for I must say that I could never\r\n    have been a brilliant ornament of it. I can assure you that I\r\n    esteem most highly the honour of dining with you and my brother\r\n    Benchers this evening, and with those distinguished men whom I\r\n    see around me right and left. I entirely agree with every word\r\n    that has fallen from the lips of our Master Treasurer, and I\r\n    sincerely hope that this gathering may tend to much good and to\r\n    bring forward those important results in legal education which\r\n    you, Sir, have advocated so admirably. I thank you for the kind\r\n    way in which you have received me, and I can only assure you\r\n    that it has afforded me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction\r\n    to meet you here this evening in this ancient Hall, where, I am\r\n    told, Queen Elizabeth once danced with Chancellor Hatton. I am\r\n    afraid that now-a-days the duties of the Chancellor are more\r\n    arduous than they were then, and that they do not allow him much\r\n    time to acquire the art of dancing. I cannot help thus reminding\r\n    you of one of the great historical events which this Hall has\r\n    witnessed, and I thank you once more for the great honour you\r\n    have done me in proposing my health and for the cordial\r\n    reception you have given me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Queen\" and \"The Prince of Wales\" were the only two toasts given at\r\nthe banquet.\r\n\r\nThe Treasurer and Benchers of the Inner Temple, on the 18th of May,\r\n1870, had entertained with much splendour His Royal Highness the Prince\r\nof Wales, His Royal Highness the Prince Christian, the Lord Chancellor,\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Chief Justice of England,\r\nthe Judges in Equity and at Common Law, the Queen's Counsel, the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, and a very distinguished company, to\r\ncelebrate the inauguration of the new Hall, which had been formally\r\nopened by Her Royal Highness the Princess Louise a few days before.\r\n\r\nThe two Royal visitors sat at the right and left hand of the Treasurer,\r\nMr. Percival Pickering. Grace was said by the Master of the Temple, Dr.\r\nVaughan. After due justice had been done to the dinner, the Treasurer\r\nhumorously described some of the strange scenes which had been enacted\r\nin the old Hall, which had been removed to make room for the present\r\nmagnificent structure. He then proposed \"The Health of the Queen,\" which\r\nwas received with loyal enthusiasm. That of \"The Prince of Wales and the\r\nother members of the Royal Family\" was felicitously acknowledged by the\r\nPrince of Wales. The Archbishop of York returned thanks for the Church,\r\nSir William Codrington for the Army, and the Colonel of the \"Devil's\r\nOwn\" for the Volunteers. Mr. Gladstone proposed \"The Health of the\r\nTreasurer,\" whose speeches throughout the evening had been seasoned with\r\nan amount of humour which rescued even those proposing the conventional\r\ntoasts from the imputation of being commonplace. \"The Health of the\r\nArchitect,\" Mr. Smirke, concluded the proceedings; and the principal\r\nportion of the company then adjourned to the drawing-room, where not\r\nonly was coffee served, but--strange novelty in such an\r\nassemblage--cigars were introduced--an innovation which did not seem\r\nunwelcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW GUILDHALL AND LAW COURTS, PLYMOUTH.\r\n\r\n_August 13th, 1874._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new Guildhall, Municipal Offices, and Law Courts at Plymouth were\r\nopened by the Prince of Wales, on the 13th of August, 1874. On landing\r\nat the Royal Victualling Yard, the Prince proceeded in a State carriage\r\nfor Plymouth. At the entrance to the borough he was received by the\r\nMayor and Corporation; the procession proceeding through dense crowds to\r\nthe Guildhall square, where the Prince was formally received as Lord\r\nHigh Steward of the Borough, and presented with his rod of office. An\r\naddress having been read by the Recorder, the Prince made the following\r\nreply:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--I rejoice at again being able to\r\n    renew my acquaintance with your ancient borough, and I return\r\n    you my grateful thanks for the expressions of goodwill which you\r\n    have paid me. The sentiments of loyalty conveyed in your\r\n    address are most gratifying proofs of the feelings which animate\r\n    the inhabitants of Plymouth towards Her Majesty the Queen and\r\n    the members of the Royal family. I have frequently visited your\r\n    borough, but never on so important an occasion as the present,\r\n    when a work of no ordinary magnitude has been completed. As High\r\n    Steward of the Borough, I cannot but take an especial interest\r\n    in all that relates to its welfare or adds to its embellishment,\r\n    and it gave me peculiar pleasure to accede to the request that\r\n    was made to me that I should open this magnificent building. In\r\n    conclusion, let me congratulate most heartily all those who have\r\n    been concerned in the undertaking on the success which has\r\n    attended their labours, and, connected as I am with your town, I\r\n    feel proud to think it has been the result of local genius,\r\n    perseverance, and energy.\"\r\n\r\nAn elegant silver key was then presented by the Mayor with which the\r\nPrince opened the new Guildhall. A banquet followed, at which, in\r\nresponse to the toast of the Prince and Princess of Wales, His Royal\r\nHighness spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Mayor, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--I beg to return\r\n    you, Mr. Mayor, my most cordial thanks for the manner in which\r\n    you have been kind enough to propose my health, and to you,\r\n    ladies and gentlemen, for the kind way in which you have been\r\n    pleased to receive it. This is by no means my first visit to\r\n    your ancient town. I have on frequent occasions spent some very\r\n    agreeable days here; but among all the different visits that I\r\n    have paid none will have been more interesting to me than the\r\n    present one, nor more vividly impressed on my memory. I assure\r\n    the Mayor and citizens of this town that great pleasure and\r\n    gratification was afforded me in opening this magnificent hall,\r\n    all the more so as my name is connected with your town as your\r\n    High Steward. I esteem it a great honour to have that title,\r\n    though the duties are certainly very slight; and if those duties\r\n    consist only in coming here and being so kindly and cordially\r\n    received by you all, I think I have every reason to congratulate\r\n    myself. I congratulate those gentlemen who have built this hall,\r\n    and who, I think, have every reason to feel satisfaction with\r\n    its appearance and its prospects of future success. To you, Mr.\r\n    Mayor, who have taken such pains during the last five years, as\r\n    Chairman of the Guildhall Committee, it must be very\r\n    gratifying; and allow me also to have the pleasure of offering\r\n    my sincere congratulations to the Mayor of Devonport, as one of\r\n    the architects of this Guildhall. I again beg to thank you for\r\n    the kind reception which you have given me to-day, and, in\r\n    conclusion, I beg also to thank you, Mr. Mayor, for the kind way\r\n    in which you have proposed the Princess of Wales's health, and\r\n    to assure you how deeply she regrets that she was unable to\r\n    accompany me on the present occasion. She is now on her way to\r\n    Scotland to meet her father, the King of Denmark, who is\r\n    returning that way from his visit to Iceland.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards the Prince proposed the health of the Mayor, thanking him for\r\nhis reception, congratulating him upon the good order maintained in the\r\nstreets, and requesting him to convey to the citizens his sense of the\r\npleasure and gratification afforded him by the artistic decorations of\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO BIRMINGHAM IN 1874.\r\n\r\n_November 3rd, 1874._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales paid their first visit to Birmingham on\r\nthe 3rd of November, 1874. When the Mayor and Corporation of the midland\r\ncapital heard of the intended visit, they resolved to give their Royal\r\nHighnesses a right loyal and hearty reception. Those who remember, or\r\nhave read of the early visits of the Queen and of the Prince Consort to\r\nthe town, will not be surprised at the enthusiasm with which the Prince\r\nand Princess of Wales were welcomed on this occasion. Prince Albert came\r\nto Birmingham for the first time in 1844. He was a guest of Sir Robert\r\nPeel at Tamworth, and expressed a wish, as he was so near, to see the\r\nplace so famous in various arts and industries. But the town was at that\r\ntime as famous for its political independence, to use the mildest term.\r\nIn fact it was regarded as the centre and seat of democratic radicalism,\r\nand the turbulence of Chartist times was yet fresh in remembrance. Fears\r\nwere entertained that Prince Albert might have a cool if not hostile\r\nreception. The result proved how groundless were these suspicions. The\r\nyoung Prince was welcomed with the utmost enthusiasm, not only as the\r\nhusband of the Queen, but on account of his own moral and intellectual\r\nexcellence. He was there again in 1849, to inspect the exhibition of\r\narts and manufactures held in Bingley Hall; and a third time in 1855 to\r\nlay the foundation stone of the Midland Institute. In 1858 the Queen\r\nherself came to open the public Park and Hall at Aston. Nor was this the\r\nonly visit. Few places in her dominions have been more favoured, and\r\nnowhere has there been shown more devoted loyalty.\r\n\r\nThe advanced radicalism of Birmingham was not less marked at the time of\r\nthe Prince of Wales's visit, and the Mayor of that year, Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain, had the reputation of holding not merely democratic but\r\nrepublican views. All this made the more marked the cordial reception of\r\nthe Royal visitors, both by the authorities of the town, and by the\r\nmasses of the people. The words of the _Times_ of November 4th, in its\r\nrecord of the visit are worthy of being recalled, especially in what it\r\nsaid of the Mayor: \"Whatever Mr. Chamberlain's views may be, his\r\nspeeches of yesterday appear to us to have been admirably worthy of the\r\noccasion, and to have done the highest credit to himself. We have heard\r\nand chronicled a great many Mayors' speeches, but we do not know that we\r\never heard or chronicled speeches made before Royal personages by\r\nMayors, whether they were Tories, or Whigs, or Liberals, or Radicals,\r\nwhich were couched in such a tone at once of courteous homage, manly\r\nindependence, and gentlemanly feeling, which were so perfectly becoming\r\nand so much the right thing in every way as those of Mr. Chamberlain.\"\r\n\r\nTo the address of the Corporation, read in the Town Hall, by the\r\nRecorder, the Prince made the following reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--In the name of the Princess of Wales\r\n    and in my own, I thank you for your address and for the kind\r\n    terms in which you refer to our visit to your town. It has long\r\n    been our wish to come to Birmingham, a city so celebrated not\r\n    only in England, but throughout the world, as one of the chief\r\n    centres of our manufacturing energy. It will be, I am persuaded,\r\n    a source of satisfaction to the Queen to hear that the loyal\r\n    inhabitants of this borough still retain so lively a\r\n    recollection of the visits which with my lamented father she\r\n    paid to Birmingham. Since that time the progress which has been\r\n    made in the varied industries of this town has been most\r\n    remarkable, and I trust that the condition of its working\r\n    population, on whose exertions its prosperity so much depends,\r\n    has improved in a still greater degree. In conclusion,\r\n    gentlemen, I have only to express our earnest wish that\r\n    Birmingham may long continue to enjoy that pre-eminence which it\r\n    has so justly earned.\"\r\n\r\nAt the luncheon subsequently given, the Mayor proposed the health of the\r\nQueen, as \"having established claims to the admiration of Her people by\r\nthe loyal fulfilment of the responsible duties of her high station, and\r\nat the same time the nobility of her domestic life has endeared her to\r\nthe nation. The care and solicitude she has manifested in the happiness\r\nof her subjects causes her name to be honoured at all times, and among\r\nall classes and ranks of society.\"\r\n\r\nIn proposing the health of the Royal guest, the Mayor said, \"This town\r\nhas been long distinguished, not without cause, for the independence of\r\nits citizens and the freedom and outspokenness in which all opinions are\r\ndiscussed, and this fact gives value to the welcome which has been\r\noffered, and stamps the sincerity of the wishes which are everywhere\r\nexpressed for the continued health of their Royal Highnesses.\"\r\n\r\nThe replies of the Prince were confined to a few brief but appropriate\r\nsentences, and after proposing the health of the Mayor, the Royal party\r\nproceeded to visit some of the most famous manufactories of the\r\ndistrict. The following letter was received next day by the Mayor, from\r\nthe Secretary of the Prince of Wales, Sir Francis Knollys, K.C.M.G.:--\r\n\r\n\"Packington Hall, Coventry, November 4, 1874.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,--I have received the commands of the Prince and Princess of Wales\r\nto make known through you to the inhabitants of the borough of\r\nBirmingham the satisfaction they derived from their visit to that town\r\nyesterday. They can never forget the reception they met with nor the\r\nwelcome given to them by all classes of the community. Their Royal\r\nHighnesses have also to thank not only the authorities who made such\r\nexcellent arrangements, but likewise the people themselves, without\r\nwhose cordial co-operation the good order which was preserved throughout\r\nthe day in so wonderful a manner could hardly have been maintained. The\r\nopportunity which was afforded them of visiting some of the manufactures\r\nof your great town gave their Royal Highnesses sincere pleasure, and it\r\nwas matter of regret to them that the time at their disposal did not\r\nallow them to make a closer inspection of works of so much interest. I\r\nmay further congratulate you and the other members of the reception\r\ncommittee on the happy result of your labours. Nothing could have been\r\nmore successful, and their Royal Highnesses will ever entertain most\r\nagreeable recollections of their visit to Birmingham. I am desired, in\r\nconclusion, to state that the Prince of Wales, being anxious to\r\ncontribute £100 in aid of the funds of one of the charitable\r\ninstitutions of your town, requests that you will have the goodness to\r\nacquaint him with the name of the institution which you may consider to\r\nbe the most deserving, and to be at the same time the most in want of\r\nsupport.--I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"FRANCIS KNOLLYS.\r\n\r\n\"To the Mayor of Birmingham.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL CAMBRIDGE ASYLUM.\r\n\r\n_March 13th, 1875._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the seventh triennial festival of this Institution the Prince of\r\nWales presided. The Duke of Cambridge, Prince Christian, Prince Edward\r\nof Saxe-Weimar, and the Duke of Teck were also present. The company\r\nincluded the Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, and a\r\nlarge number of distinguished officers of nearly all ranks in the Army.\r\n\r\nAfter the toast of \"The Queen,\" proposed by the Royal chairman, the Lord\r\nMayor, in giving the next toast, spoke of \"the pride with which the\r\nnation at large regarded the Royal Family, not only on account of the\r\nadmirable way in which they performed the important duties connected\r\nwith their high position, but also because of their readiness on all\r\noccasions to promote and aid the various charitable institutions of the\r\ncountry, and to extend their sympathy to all who were in distress, not\r\nsimply in this great metropolis, but in all parts of the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am sure I have every reason to be grateful to the Lord Mayor\r\n    for the very kind manner in which he has proposed my health and\r\n    that of the Princess of Wales and the other members of the Royal\r\n    Family, and to the company here assembled for the very kind\r\n    manner in which they have received the toast. Nothing is more\r\n    disagreeable, I think, than to have at an early stage of the\r\n    evening to rise to return thanks for one's own health; but, at\r\n    the same time, I should be very ungrateful to you if I were not\r\n    to thank you for the cordial manner in which you acceded to the\r\n    request of the Lord Mayor. I can assure him--and I believe I can\r\n    speak also for the rest of the Royal Family--that it is always\r\n    our earnest endeavour to do our duty, and to assist in all good\r\n    and charitable objects, which in this country are so numerous\r\n    and so necessary. It will be my duty to address you again, so I\r\n    will now only thank you once more for the kind manner in which\r\n    you have received this toast.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, after a brief interval, again rose and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"The toast I have now to offer to you is also one of those which\r\n    are always given, and which are always heartily received at\r\n    gatherings like the present. It is that of 'The Army and the\r\n    Navy.' I find some difficulty on this occasion in proposing that\r\n    toast, because when I look around me and see the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief, the greater portion of the Head Quarters'\r\n    Staff, and so many distinguished generals and officers, I feel\r\n    it would be very presumptuous on my part were I to dilate on the\r\n    subject. I think Englishmen have every reason to be proud of\r\n    possessing such an Army and Navy as ours. Of course we don't\r\n    pretend that they are perfection, but I am sure that every\r\n    endeavour is used year after year to make our land and sea\r\n    forces as efficient as possible for our defence and for the\r\n    maintenance of peace both in this country and in our vast\r\n    possessions abroad. In connection with the Army, it gives me the\r\n    greatest pleasure to propose the health of my illustrious\r\n    relative, the Commander-in-Chief. It would ill become me to make\r\n    those remarks in his presence which it would afford me sincere\r\n    satisfaction to offer were he absent; but I am sure that you, as\r\n    brother officers, know the great interest the Commander-in-Chief\r\n    takes in the Army, and I know you will drink his health most\r\n    cordially on this occasion. I am not able to couple any name\r\n    with the Navy, for the very sufficient reason that there is no\r\n    naval officer present to respond to it. I regret that our\r\n    gallant sea forces are not represented, but the toast will not\r\n    on that account, I am sure, be less cordially received.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge, who was loudly cheered, said: \"I personally am\r\nmuch gratified by the kind reception which has been given to my name in\r\nconjunction with this toast. His Royal Highness, with a modesty which is\r\ndelightful in one in his position, has expressed diffidence in proposing\r\nit; but there is no ground for such diffidence on his part, for there is\r\nno officer in the Army that I know of who takes a more lively interest\r\nin the efficiency of the service, even in its every detail, or who,\r\nwhenever the opportunity offers, shows a greater aptitude than does His\r\nRoyal Highness. He has proved a most worthy spokesman for the Army on\r\nthis and on many other occasions, and I am sure officers of the Army are\r\nalways flattered and gratified when His Royal Highness has the\r\nopportunity of speaking of them as he has done this evening. I feel\r\nparticular interest in being present here, and I beg to express to His\r\nRoyal Highness, who has many and constant duties to attend to, my thanks\r\nand those of my mother, who is, unfortunately, in a very suffering\r\nstate, for having, on the mere expression of a wish on her part, at once\r\nconsented to preside on this occasion. I beg also to thank you for the\r\ncompliment which you have paid me and my family by your attendance, for\r\nI cannot forget that this institution was originally founded in memory\r\nof my father, who had many opportunities of showing the deep interest he\r\ntook in the charitable institutions of the country. On that account many\r\nof his friends were anxious that some testimonial should be established\r\nto his memory, and instead of a statue I am happy to think, as I am sure\r\nhe would have been glad to know, that it took the form of the useful and\r\nnecessary institution we have met here to assist. But for its aid the\r\nrecipients of its benefits would have to drag out a miserable existence\r\neither in the workhouse or under even still worse circumstances. We must\r\nall feel gratified that these old women are, thanks to the benevolence\r\nof yourselves and the public, enabled to pass their last days in the\r\ncomparative comfort that they find in the Asylum at Kingston. As head of\r\nthe Army, I may say that a higher compliment could not possibly have\r\nbeen paid to it than to establish an institution such as this, and I am\r\ngratified to think that the support it has received leads us to the hope\r\nthat it is now established on a solid and valuable foundation. I beg\r\nagain to thank you, in the name of the Army, and to say that the service\r\nfeels the deepest interest in the prosperity of the Asylum.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales next rose and said;--\r\n\r\n    \"It is now my pleasing duty to bring before you the toast of the\r\n    evening, 'Prosperity to the Royal Cambridge Asylum for Soldiers'\r\n    Widows.' When I see how I am surrounded and how large a\r\n    gathering is present, I feel sure I shall not call on you in\r\n    vain in the interest of those whom we are concerned in\r\n    benefiting on this occasion. As my illustrious relative has\r\n    mentioned to you, this institution was established as a memorial\r\n    to his illustrious father, the late Duke of Cambridge. The\r\n    object was to provide a home for the widows of privates and\r\n    non-commissioned officers of the Army. No such institution\r\n    previously existed, and it is still the only one of its kind in\r\n    the country. In it the widows are provided with a furnished room\r\n    and an allowance of 6_s._ a week, besides a grant of 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n    per month for coals. While the expenditure is great, exceeding\r\n    £2000, the funded income, including £50 a year, called the\r\n    Princess Mary Fund for Nurses, amounts to little over £500 a\r\n    year. It was originally intended to have, if possible, 130\r\n    inmates, but at the present moment there are only 57, for there\r\n    is no room for more, and our great object is to make the\r\n    institution a success by increasing the numbers. On\r\n    philanthropic grounds alone it is almost unnecessary to say a\r\n    word as to its excellence. But when one thinks of the soldier,\r\n    who has not only to expose his life in battle, but to run the\r\n    risk of sickness and disease in a variety of different climates,\r\n    away from home, often leaving his wife for many years behind\r\n    him, it is impossible not to see that it must be a comfort to\r\n    him, especially if ill or dying, to think there is an\r\n    institution where his wife, if he succumbs, has a chance of\r\n    being provided for. Among soldiers there can be but one feeling\r\n    on this subject, and I am sure that on this occasion I shall not\r\n    appeal to those who are present in vain.\r\n\r\n    \"I regret very much that one who has taken a deep interest in\r\n    this institution--its chairman, Sir Edward Cust--is not here on\r\n    this occasion, and I fear on account of illness. But it is some\r\n    gratification to be able to read to you an extract from a letter\r\n    of his, dated the 1st of March, to Colonel Stewart, the\r\n    secretary, in which he says--\"I think I intimated to you last\r\n    year that I should make a disposition by my will of all my\r\n    copyright and interest in my military histories for the benefit\r\n    of the Asylum. As I am unable to support the Prince of Wales in\r\n    the chair, may I beg the favour of His Royal Highness making\r\n    this donation in my name as evidence of my sympathy for the\r\n    institution?\" Those who are present know so thoroughly well all\r\n    the merits of the institution that it would be unnecessary for\r\n    me to make a lengthened speech. I will therefore wind up by once\r\n    more asking you to do all in your power to assist in\r\n    accomplishing the great object we have in view of extending the\r\n    building so as to accommodate more widows. With the toast which\r\n    I have given you, I beg, in the absence of Sir E. Cust, to\r\n    couple the name of Colonel Liddell.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Liddell, who responded, said it was the desire to provide\r\naccommodation for one widow from each regiment in the service, which, of\r\ncourse, as there were only fifty-seven inmates, left a great deal still\r\nto be done.\r\n\r\n    The Prince of Wales: \"I have now to propose a toast which, I am\r\n    sure, of all those I have given none will have been received\r\n    with greater cordiality, for it is that of the 'Lady Patron.'\r\n    You all, I know, wish as sincerely as I do that her\r\n    health--which is not good just at present--may be restored, and\r\n    that she may be among us for some years yet to come. One of the\r\n    reasons why this institution has prospered so much, and why so\r\n    many are here to-night, is the regard which is felt for the kind\r\n    and good lady who is its president. It is not surprising that\r\n    she should take a deep interest in an asylum intended indirectly\r\n    for the benefit of soldiers, seeing that her husband was a\r\n    soldier and that her son is a soldier.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast having been cordially drunk, was responded to by the Duke of\r\nCambridge, who then proposed \"The Health of the Lord Mayor and the\r\nSheriffs,\" thanking them for the liberality with which they had\r\nsubscribed to the funds of the Asylum. The total amount of the\r\nsubscriptions received was announced by the Prince of Wales to be £1635\r\n17_s._ 10_d._\r\n\r\nThe present number of inmates (1888) is sixty-nine. The receipts of the\r\nprevious year were £2700; the invested funds nearly £23,000. The\r\nfestival dinner is triennial, but additional sums have been obtained by\r\nmilitary _fêtes_ and other ways. In 1872 the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales were present at a grand military concert in the Royal Albert Hall,\r\nwhen Madame Titiens and other artists volunteered their assistance, and\r\nmany of the proprietors placed their boxes and stalls at the disposal of\r\nthe Duke of Edinburgh, who was Chairman of the Committee for carrying\r\nout the arrangements. We trust that the Duke of Cambridge may be\r\ngratified by witnessing a large increase of the numbers benefited by an\r\ninstitution in which he takes so zealous and kindly interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT MERCHANT TAYLORS' SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n_April 6th, 1875._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Charterhouse School was removed from its ancient historic site\r\nto the more remote and rural site at Godalming, arrangements were made\r\nfor installing Merchant Taylors' School in the Charterhouse. There was\r\nample accommodation for the 400 or 500 boys. Portions of the old\r\nstructure remain, and these with the new buildings give room for the\r\nnumerous classes, with large halls, library, lecture rooms, and a\r\nmagnificent assembly room, for morning and evening prayers, and on grand\r\ndays for speeches and prize festivals. The poor Brethren, pensioners on\r\nthe foundation, remain in their old quarters, and their chapel, with its\r\nservices, continues as before.\r\n\r\nThe installation of the Merchant Taylors' School in the Charterhouse was\r\nan event of sufficient importance to justify the request for the\r\nceremony being honoured by the presence of the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales, who came on 6th of April, 1875, accompanied by the Princess Mary\r\nand Duke of Teck, and other illustrious visitors. Service having been\r\nperformed in the old Carthusian chapel; and an address having been read\r\nby the clerk, and presented by the Master of the Company; the Prince\r\ndeclared the Merchant Taylors' School open. An ode in Latin Alcaics was\r\nthen declaimed by the head monitor of the School, the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury offered a prayer for the Divine blessing, and the service\r\nclosed with the Lord's Prayer and the Benediction.\r\n\r\nLuncheon was afterwards served in the assembly hall. The Master of the\r\nCompany gave a brief account of the origin and history of the School,\r\nintroducing references to former Princes of Wales, who had been\r\nbenefactors of the Company, from the time of Edward I., the first Prince\r\nof Wales, to that of King James I., who with his son, the Prince of\r\nWales, dined in this hall. It was for that occasion, in 1607, that Dr.\r\nJohn Bull composed the music of \"God Save the Queen.\" The Queen of James\r\nI. was Anne of Denmark. \"History repeats itself,\" continued the Master,\r\n\"for you, Sire, have entwined the flower of Denmark in the wreath of\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, responding to the toast then given, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"For the excessively kind and flattering manner in which this\r\n    toast has been proposed from the chair, and received by you all,\r\n    I beg to return my warmest and most sincere thanks. I need\r\n    hardly assure the Master and all those assembled here to-day\r\n    what pleasure it has given to the Princess and myself to be\r\n    present on this occasion. The numerous guilds of the City of\r\n    London are well known for their hospitality, and especially\r\n    distinguished is the Merchant Taylors' Company. At the same\r\n    time, although they kindly and cordially receive their guests,\r\n    they do all they can to make themselves useful in this great\r\n    city. I will not recapitulate what we have heard in another\r\n    room, and also from the lips of the Master, of the prosperity of\r\n    this School. I hope it will continue to flourish; and that the\r\n    sun which is now shining will bring prosperity to a School which\r\n    has so long flourished and which is now moved to other\r\n    buildings. I must say we cannot but congratulate the Master and\r\n    the Guild on the beautiful building in which we are assembled at\r\n    the present moment. In conclusion let me propose a toast I am\r\n    sure you will all drink with enthusiasm--'Success to the\r\n    Merchant Taylors' School.' It affords me great pleasure to\r\n    couple with it the name of the head master, the Rev. Dr.\r\n    Baker.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the luncheon the Royal visitors inspected the buildings, and\r\nwalked through the playground, which is of considerable size for a city\r\nschool. The cheers of the boys on the departure of the Prince and\r\nPrincess were the more vehement, as they had asked and obtained from the\r\nMaster an extra week's holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n_April 16th, 1875._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German Hospital, at Dalston, is one of the most useful and\r\nwell-managed charities in the Metropolis. It is for the reception of\r\nnatives of Germany, and others speaking the German language; also for\r\nEnglish in case of accident. There are now 125 beds for in-patients,\r\nwith a sanatarium for the benefit of those who can pay a moderate sum\r\nweekly for their maintenance during illness. There is also a\r\nConvalescent Home, with about twenty beds. During the past year there\r\nwere 1663 in-patients, 23,210 out-patients, and 1163 dental cases. The\r\nHamburg Church is connected with the Hospital by a corridor. The yearly\r\nreceipts average now about £10,000, and there is funded property\r\namounting to £55,000.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales presided at the thirtieth anniversary festival, at\r\nWillis's Rooms, on the 16th of April, 1875. About three hundred were\r\npresent, including some Ambassadors and Consuls of Continental States,\r\nand other distinguished foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in proposing the health of \"The Queen,\" said that Her\r\nMajesty took the greatest interest in the welfare of the Hospital, of\r\nwhich she was a protector, and a donor to its funds.\r\n\r\nCount Beust, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, gave the toast of \"The\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales and the Royal Family.\" He said that he\r\nspoke the sentiments of the representatives of all German-speaking\r\ncountries, when he said that the \"Royal Chairman had always shown for\r\nthe German Hospital a feeling German heart and an open English hand.\r\nWhen he brought under the notice of his Sovereign, the Emperor of\r\nAustria, that the Prince was to preside at the festival, he was\r\nimmediately instructed by His Majesty to announce the donation from him\r\nof £100 to the funds. Let us, one and all, drink to our illustrious\r\nChairman, whom the people of England know not only as a gracious and\r\npopular Prince, but also as a high-minded, generous gentleman, who takes\r\na deep and active interest in all that contributes to the greatness and\r\nthe welfare of the country, and to the relief of the sufferers among the\r\nless fortunate of the community, in the fulfilment of which noble task\r\nhe is well supported by his gracious Princess.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I can hardly find words adequate enough to express my deep\r\n    thanks to his Excellency the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador for the\r\n    exceedingly kind and flattering manner in which he has proposed\r\n    this toast, and to you all for the hearty way in which it was\r\n    received. I can assure you that it affords me the greatest\r\n    pleasure and gratification to be your chairman on the present\r\n    occasion. The members of my family have now for some years taken\r\n    a deep interest in this charity, and I take the same interest.\r\n    This is not at all to be wondered at, considering that we have\r\n    German blood running in our veins. We have the greatest sympathy\r\n    with the foreigners who live in our country, and we gladly join\r\n    in an attempt like this to alleviate their sufferings in every\r\n    possible way. The President of the German Hospital, the Duke of\r\n    Cambridge, as did his father before him, takes a warm interest\r\n    in this institution, and I sincerely hope that our family will\r\n    always remain connected with so excellent and admirable a\r\n    charity. I thank you once more for the hearty reception you have\r\n    accorded to the toast.\"\r\n\r\n    The Prince, again rising, proposed in cordial terms: \"The\r\n    Foreign Sovereigns and Princes, Protectors and Patrons of the\r\n    Institution, and their Representatives who had honoured them\r\n    with their presence.\" He stated that \"the Emperor of Germany\r\n    gave an annual donation of £200 to the charity, and that the\r\n    Emperors of Russia and Austria, and the Kings of Würtemberg,\r\n    Bavaria, Saxony, and the Netherlands, had also evinced a\r\n    practical interest in the institution.\"\r\n\r\nCount Münster, the German Ambassador, whose name was coupled with the\r\ntoast, said he agreed with his friend and colleague, Count Beust, that\r\nit was one of the most pleasant duties of diplomatists to be present on\r\noccasions of that kind, and he felt it, indeed, a great honour to return\r\nthanks for the kind and gracious manner in which His Royal Highness had\r\nproposed the health of the foreign Sovereigns and their representatives.\r\nHe was quite sure that the interest which their Majesties had taken in\r\nthat fine, benevolent institution would be much strengthened when they\r\nbecame aware that the first gentleman in England--the heir to the\r\nBritish Throne--had shown his practical sympathy with it by presiding\r\nthat evening. Benevolence and hospitality had always been the\r\ncharacteristics of the English people, but how could it be otherwise\r\nwhen the Royal Family invariably set them, on every possible occasion,\r\nthe noblest and best example? In the name of his fellow-countrymen he\r\ntendered to His Royal Highness their most hearty thanks for the\r\ngracious part he was taking at that gathering.\r\n\r\n    The Prince of Wales next gave \"The Army, Navy, and Reserve\r\n    Forces,\" saying, in doing so, that every Englishman was proud of\r\n    the land and sea forces of his country, and he always hoped they\r\n    were in a highly efficient state. At the same time the Prince\r\n    sincerely trusted that the occasion might never arise in which\r\n    the Army and Navy might be called forth to battle with those\r\n    countries so many of whose representatives were present that\r\n    evening.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir William Knollys made a brief reply. The Prince of Wales then\r\ngave as the toast of the evening: \"Prosperity to the German Hospital.\"\r\nHe said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I can only regret that a toast of so much importance as this is\r\n    has not fallen into better hands than mine, but, whatever my\r\n    shortcomings, I am sure you will take the will for the deed.\r\n    This toast has been given for a great many successive years, and\r\n    the few remarks that I have to make to you will not be new to\r\n    the great portion of the vast assembly who are gathered here\r\n    this evening. At the same time, as I am your chairman, I think\r\n    it my duty to make a few observations in connexion with the\r\n    German Hospital.\r\n\r\n    \"As most of you are doubtless aware, it has 103 beds generally\r\n    full, and last year the total in-and out-patients amounted to\r\n    about 18,000. Of these there were 1300 in-patients, of whom 240\r\n    were English. Besides the hospital there is a sanitarium, to\r\n    which 42 persons were admitted. The rooms there are\r\n    unfortunately limited in number, but the occupants are rather of\r\n    a well-to-do class, such as professors, governesses, clerks, and\r\n    others, who, in return for the services rendered to them, give a\r\n    small sum of money towards defraying the necessary costs. Last\r\n    year the expenses of the hospital were very heavy, amounting to\r\n    £6500, exclusive of £600 for improvements. This, I hear, is\r\n    likely to be increased considerably in the next accounts, owing\r\n    to the continuous rise of prices. Fortunately, I am able to\r\n    announce to you that the receipts nearly covered the\r\n    expenditure. The fixed income, however, can only be put down at\r\n    £1200 or £1300 a year, and the authorities of the hospital, to\r\n    carry it on successfully and to keep it out of debt, have to\r\n    collect annually between £4000 and £5000.\r\n\r\n    \"I think every Englishman and every foreigner will agree as to\r\n    the necessity for a hospital founded as this is. We who are\r\n    Englishmen must all feel what a terrible position we should be\r\n    in if we found ourselves weary and sick in a country where it\r\n    was impossible to make ourselves understood. When, therefore, we\r\n    are told that in this London of ours all who speak German are\r\n    instantly admitted to this institution, we can readily imagine\r\n    the enormous benefits which foreigners and Germans especially\r\n    derive from it. There are, I am told, as many as 50,000 Germans\r\n    living in London, many of whom have to work in unhealthy trades,\r\n    such as sugar-baking. They are mostly confined indoors all day\r\n    long, and, but for this hospital, they would not know where to\r\n    go to find comfort and succour.\r\n\r\n    \"A great merit, in my mind, of this institution is that it is a\r\n    free one. It is not at all necessary to obtain a letter of\r\n    recommendation before admission. Sick people have only to\r\n    present themselves there and speak German to insure that the\r\n    doors will be immediately thrown open to them, and that they\r\n    will be tended and cared for in the most admirable manner. The\r\n    nurses there are all trained in Elizabethan-stift at Darmstadt,\r\n    and they do their work admirably under the care of the excellent\r\n    chaplain (Dr. Walbaum), who has taken so deep an interest in the\r\n    welfare of the hospital. They are thus found most important to\r\n    the working of the hospital.\r\n\r\n    \"As so many Englishmen derive benefit from the institution, I am\r\n    sure I can appeal to my fellow-countrymen to do all in their\r\n    power, and I ask the company generally to see if they cannot\r\n    collect a sum larger than on any previous occasion. At the last\r\n    annual dinner, at which the Duke of Cambridge presided, a sum of\r\n    £500 in excess of any former collection was obtained, and I hope\r\n    to-night we may even exceed the sum subscribed then. I may tell\r\n    you that a distinguished guest among us to-night, Baron von\r\n    Diergadt, of Bonn, sent us a few years ago the magnificent\r\n    donation of £10,000. I do not ask you, gentlemen, to give quite\r\n    so large a sum as the Baron, but I am sure that all that is in\r\n    your power to give you will. I desire to tender our thanks to\r\n    the Emperor of Austria for his munificent donation, announced\r\n    by his Ambassador this evening, and I will now ask you all most\r\n    cordially to assist me in supporting this excellent charity. I\r\n    give you as the toast of the evening: 'Prosperity to the German\r\n    Hospital.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary (Mr. Feldmann) afterwards announced the receipt of\r\ndonations (including £105 from the Prince of Wales, £200 from the\r\nEmperor of Germany, and £100 from the Emperor of Austria) to the amount\r\nof over £5000, being £1200 in excess of any previous collection. Other\r\ntoasts, including \"The health of Baron von Diergadt, of Bonn,\" followed.\r\nDuring dinner, Mr. Marriott's band played a selection of operatic music,\r\nand afterward, at intervals, a choir, under the direction of Sir Julius\r\nBenedict and Herr Ganz (all of whom gave their services gratuitously),\r\nsang some German songs by Schubert, Schumann, Seidl, and other\r\ncomposers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION AS GRAND MASTER OF ENGLISH FREEMASONS.\r\n\r\n_April 28th, 1875._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the history of Freemasonry there has never occurred an event more\r\nmemorable, or a scene more imposing than the Installation of the Prince\r\nof Wales as Grand Master of English Freemasons, at the Royal Albert\r\nHall, on the 28th of April, 1875. The vast Hall was filled with nearly\r\nten thousand members of the craft, of all ranks and degrees, and in\r\ncostume proper to their masonic conditions. An open space, in front of\r\nthe organ, had been reserved for the Grand Officers, and for\r\ndistinguished visitors, including deputations from various foreign\r\nlodges.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Carnarvon, the Pro-Grand Master, having taken his seat on\r\nthe throne, performed the ceremonies necessary for to convert the\r\nassemblage into a meeting of the Grand Lodge, and the Minute of the\r\nPrince's election as Grand Master having been read and confirmed, Garter\r\nKing-at-Arms formed and headed a procession to meet His Royal Highness.\r\nThe Duke of Connaught had already seated himself near the Pro-Grand\r\nMaster, and had been warmly received; but when the Prince entered the\r\nHall, the vast assemblage rose as one man, and, regardless for the\r\nmoment alike of Masonic order and of the ceremonies of the craft,\r\ngreeted him with such applause as even his experience at public\r\nassemblages could seldom have heard equalled. The Prince was conducted\r\nup the arena to a chair on the left of the Pro-Grand Master, and before\r\nseating himself he bowed repeatedly in response to the plaudits of the\r\nbrethren. He then went through the forms prescribed by the Masonic\r\nritual, and was duly inducted into his throne, the enthusiasm of the\r\nassembled Freemasons once again outstripping the proper order of the\r\nceremonial, and finding vent in cheers with which the building rang\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nGarter King-at-Arms, who holds also the high Masonic office of Grand\r\nDirector of Ceremonies, then proclaimed His Royal Highness in due form,\r\nand called upon the brethren to salute him in Masonic fashion. This\r\nbeing done, the Earl of Carnarvon rose from the seat to which he had\r\nretired, and, according to ancient custom, addressed the new Grand\r\nMaster on the duties of his office. He thus concluded his address:--\r\n\r\n\"Your Royal Highness is not the first by many of your illustrious family\r\nwho have sat in that chair. It is, no doubt, by the lustre of your great\r\nname and position you will reflect honour on the craft to-day; but it is\r\nalso something to be at the head of such a body as is represented here.\r\nI may truly say that never in the whole history of Freemasonry has such\r\na Grand Lodge been convened as that on which my eye rests at this\r\nmoment, and there is further an inner view to be taken, that so far as\r\nmy eyes can carry me over these serried ranks of white and blue, the\r\ngold and purple, I recognise in them men who have solemnly taken\r\nobligations of worth and morality--men who have undertaken the duties of\r\ncitizens and the loyalty of subjects. I am expressing but very feebly\r\nthe feelings and aspirations of this great assemblage when I say that I\r\ntrust the connexion of your Royal Highness with the craft may be\r\nlasting, and that you may never have occasion for one moment's regret or\r\nanxiety when you look back upon the events of to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, who was again greeted with loud and prolonged cheering,\r\nreplied in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n    \"Brethren, I am deeply grateful to the Most Worshipful the\r\n    Pro-Grand Master for the excessively kind words he has just\r\n    spoken to you, and for the cordial reception which you have\r\n    given me. It has been your unanimous wish that I should occupy\r\n    this chair as your Grand Master, and you have this day installed\r\n    me. It is difficult for me to find words adequate to express my\r\n    deep thanks for the honour which has already been bestowed upon\r\n    me--an honour which has, as history bears testimony, been\r\n    bestowed upon several members of my family, my predecessors;\r\n    and, brethren, it will always be my most ardent and sincere wish\r\n    to walk in the footsteps of good men who have preceded me, and,\r\n    with God's help, to fulfil the duties which I have been called\r\n    upon to occupy to-day.\r\n\r\n    \"The Pro-Grand Master has told you, brethren, and I feel\r\n    convinced, that such an assemblage as this has never been\r\n    known; and when I look round me on this vast and spacious Hall,\r\n    and see those who have come from the north and south, from the\r\n    east and the west, it is, I trust, an omen which will prove on\r\n    this auspicious occasion an omen of good. The various duties\r\n    which I have to perform will frequently, I am afraid, not permit\r\n    me to attend so much to the duties of the craft as I should\r\n    desire; but you may be assured that when I have the time I shall\r\n    do the utmost to maintain this high position, and do my duty by\r\n    the craft, and by you on every possible occasion. Brethren, it\r\n    would be useless for me to recapitulate everything which has\r\n    been told you by the Pro-Grand Master relative to Freemasonry.\r\n    Every Englishman knows that the two great watchwords of the\r\n    craft are Loyalty and Charity. These are their watchwords, and\r\n    as long as Freemasons do not, as Freemasons, mix themselves up\r\n    in politics so long I am sure this high and noble order will\r\n    flourish, and will maintain the integrity of our great Empire.\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you once more, brethren, for your cordial reception of\r\n    me to-day, and I thank you for having come such immense\r\n    distances to welcome me on this occasion. I assure you I shall\r\n    never forget to-day--never!\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince resumed his seat amid loud cheers, which were long continued.\r\nHis Royal Highness spoke with a perfect elocution which rendered every\r\nsyllable audible to the whole of the vast assemblage; but when (adds the\r\nreporter of the scene) in conclusion, he uttered a manifest impromptu in\r\nsaying that the reception which had been accorded to him, and the\r\nspectacle which he witnessed, were things which to the last day of his\r\nlife he \"should never forget--never!\" there was just so much tremor of\r\nhis voice as seemed to show that even the trained self-possession of\r\nRoyalty was somewhat shaken, as indeed it well might be, by the\r\nmagnitude and the splendour of the spectacle.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the Prince's address the march from \"Eli\" was\r\nperformed upon the organ, and then, a telegraphic address of\r\ncongratulation from the Grand Lodge at Genoa having previously been\r\nread, deputations from the Grand Lodges of Scotland, Ireland, Sweden,\r\nand Denmark were successively introduced. The Grand Master next\r\nappointed the Earl of Carnarvon to be Pro-Grand Master, Lord\r\nSkelmersdale to be Deputy Grand Master, and the Marquis of Hamilton and\r\nthe Lord Mayor to fill two chief offices in Grand Lodge. The nomination\r\nof the Lord Mayor appeared to give especial pleasure to the brethren,\r\nand his Lordship, as he took his official seat, was greeted by loud and\r\nprolonged applause. The other grand officers were then appointed, and\r\nat five o'clock the Lodge was formally closed. The Prince was conducted\r\nto his retiring-room by a procession of the principal brethren, and the\r\nassembly dispersed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the evening there was a banquet in the Freemasons' Hall, in Great\r\nQueen Street, which was thronged as it was never thronged before. The\r\nPrince of Wales, Most Worshipful Grand Master, presided; on his right\r\nbeing the Duke of Connaught, and on his left Lord Skelmersdale, the\r\nDeputy Grand Master. Distinguished officers and members of lodges from\r\nall parts of the United Kingdom were present.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master proposed the health of \"The Queen,\" in these words:--\r\n\r\n    \"Brethren, the first toast I shall have the honour to propose to\r\n    you this evening is one which I know will require as few words\r\n    as possible, as it is always drunk with enthusiasm at all great\r\n    meetings of Englishmen, more especially at meetings of the\r\n    craft. I propose 'The Health of Her Majesty the Queen, the\r\n    Patroness of our Order.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Manchester, in proposing the health of \"The Princess of\r\nWales and the rest of the Royal Family,\" said: \"We have for the first\r\ntime among us as Most Worshipful Grand Master, the eldest son of Her\r\nMajesty, and his brother, the Duke of Connaught, whom we all highly\r\nesteem and love as the sons of a father whose memory we all so fondly\r\ncherish, and whom we so much regret.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught responded, and proposed \"The\r\nhealth of the Most Worshipful the Grand Master.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Brethren, I beg to return my most sincere and my most grateful\r\n    thanks to the Junior Master Mason of England for the kind way in\r\n    which he has proposed my health, and to you, brethren, for the\r\n    cordial manner in which you have received it. This is the first\r\n    time, brethren, that I have had the honour of presiding at the\r\n    grand festival. I can assure you I am very grateful for your\r\n    kind reception of me this evening, and I sincerely hope that we\r\n    may have the pleasure of meeting together on these festive\r\n    occasions many, many long years to come. I shall never forget,\r\n    brethren, the ceremony of to-day and the reception which you\r\n    gave me. I only hope that you may never regret the choice you\r\n    have made of your Grand Master. Brethren, I assure you on all\r\n    occasions I shall do my utmost to do my duty in the position in\r\n    which you have so kindly placed me.\r\n\r\n    \"Before sitting down, brethren, I have a toast to propose, which\r\n    I feel sure you will all drink with cordiality, and which to me\r\n    is a specially gratifying toast--that is, the health of our\r\n    illustrious brother the King of Sweden and Norway. It affords me\r\n    especial pleasure to propose this toast, as seven years ago I\r\n    became a member of this craft, initiated by the late King, the\r\n    brother of the present one. Thereby I consider I have a more\r\n    special interest in Sweden; and I hope that the Grand Lodges of\r\n    Sweden and of England may always be bound together in goodwill\r\n    and fraternal feeling. Our illustrious brother the King has been\r\n    especially pleased to send over five distinguished brethren to\r\n    take part in my installation. Therefore it affords me special\r\n    gratification to drink to the health of one who I know is such a\r\n    keen Freemason at heart, and so keen an Englishman, that he has\r\n    frequently visited our shores. Most cordially and heartily do I\r\n    call upon you, brethren, to drink to 'The health of our\r\n    illustrious brother the Most Worshipful Grand Master of Sweden,\r\n    His Majesty the King of Sweden and Norway.'\"\r\n\r\nCount Salcza responded, and, speaking in French, he passed a high\r\neulogium on Freemasonry, and expressed his great gratification at the\r\nmagnificent ceremony that had been witnessed in the afternoon, laying\r\nespecial stress upon the Masonic good feeling between Sweden and Great\r\nBritain. He spoke of himself as feeling that he stood among friends and\r\nbrothers, and he thanked them for their cordial reception.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Grand Master then said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Brethren, we are honoured here this evening by the\r\n    representatives of the Grand Lodges of Scotland, of Ireland, and\r\n    of Sweden, and I feel convinced that you will all drink with me\r\n    most cordially and most heartily to their health. The Grand\r\n    Lodge of England is always most desirous of being on the best\r\n    possible terms with the Grand Lodges of Scotland and Ireland.\r\n    Although separate through having other Grand Masters, still\r\n    those three Grand Lodges may consider one another more or less\r\n    as one. I have great pleasure in proposing the health of my\r\n    noble friend and brother, Lord Rosslyn, as representative of the\r\n    Grand Lodge of Scotland, and I cannot forget the kind reception\r\n    I met with at Edinburgh some years ago when he was Deputy Grand\r\n    Master, and I received the rank of Patron of Scotch Freemasons\r\n    at the hands of the late Earl Dalhousie. It also gives me great\r\n    pleasure to propose the health of the representative of the\r\n    Grand Lodge of Ireland, coupled with the name of Brother\r\n    Shekleton, Deputy Grand Master. I have also the great privilege\r\n    of being Patron of the Irish Grand Lodge, which honour I also\r\n    remember, a few years ago, receiving from the late Duke of\r\n    Leinster, who was the popular Grand Master of Ireland at that\r\n    time, and the reception I met with I shall not easily forget. As\r\n    the representative of the Grand Lodge of Sweden it affords the\r\n    great pleasure to couple with this toast the name of the Admiral\r\n    on my left. As my earliest associations in Freemasonry have been\r\n    with the Grand Lodge of Sweden, I know when I address those\r\n    gentlemen I see before me they will appreciate the pleasure it\r\n    affords me in proposing this toast. Brethren, I give you the\r\n    toast of 'The Grand Lodges of Scotland, Ireland, and Sweden,\r\n    coupled with the names of Lord Rosslyn, Brother Shekleton, and\r\n    Admiral Oscar Dickson.' I also include in this toast all the\r\n    other Grand Lodges.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast having been drunk, Lord Rosslyn said:--\r\n\r\n\"Most Worshipful Grand Master and brethren, the honour that your Royal\r\nHighness has done the deputation of the Grand Lodge of Scotland is\r\nwarmly appreciated by them. I am glad, indeed, to have the opportunity\r\nafter so many years' connexion with the Grand Lodge of Scotland--no less\r\nthan twenty-five years--of congratulating the craft of England and your\r\nRoyal Highness also, upon the most magnificent scene I have ever\r\nwitnessed in my life.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad also to think that the splendour, and, I must add, admirable\r\nmanagement of the display to-day, does not quite efface from your Royal\r\nHighness's recollection, the scene upon a similar scale which we\r\nendeavoured to offer you when we had the honour of having your name as\r\nPatron of the Scottish craft. Your Royal Highness has been good enough\r\nto say that you have not forgotten the occasion. I can assure your Royal\r\nHighness no Scotchman will ever forget it, and I can speak on behalf of\r\nthe Grand Lodge of Scotland, with which I have been so long connected,\r\nhaving served every office in it, from Junior Deacon up to Grand Master,\r\nhaving been not quite a holiday Freemason, but worked my way from the\r\nranks up to the position I have the honour to hold now.\r\n\r\n\"His Royal Highness has this day told us what the duties of Freemasonry\r\nare, and there is no doubt he has summed them up in two words--loyalty\r\nand charity--which includes mercy, a quality that has been described by\r\nthe greatest of poets as becoming 'the throned Monarch better than his\r\ncrown.' There can be no doubt that under the auspices of the Most\r\nWorshipful Grand Master the Grand Lodge of England will flourish, and\r\nwill continue to be a standard for Masonry all over the world.\"\r\n\r\nBrother R. W. Shekleton, Deputy Grand Master of Ireland, spoke of the\r\nloyalty of Irish Masons, who are, he said, \"remarkable for fear of God,\r\nfealty to the Sovereign, love to the brotherhood, and friendship to all\r\nclasses and creeds.\"\r\n\r\nBrother Admiral Oscar Dickson returned thanks in the name of the Swedish\r\nGrand Lodge for the honour conferred upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Most Worshipful Grand Master then proposed the toast of various\r\nGrand Officers and Brethren, according to custom. Sir Erasmus Wilson\r\nreplied for the Stewards, whose special duty it was, with the aid of\r\ntheir good Brother Francatelli (the Master Cook), to see to the humble\r\nbut necessary ceremonies consequent on our sublunary existence; or, in\r\nthe beautiful words of our Ritual: \"to lead them to unite in the grand\r\ndesign of being happy and communicating happiness.\"\r\n\r\nAs long before as the 1st of December, 1869, the Prince of Wales had\r\nbeen received, at Freemasons' Hall, as a Past Grand Master, at a meeting\r\nof the United Grand Lodge of England; and in a brief speech replied to\r\nthe address delivered by Lord Zetland, who was at that time Grand\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\nOne of the first appointments made by the Prince of Wales as Grand\r\nMaster was that of Colonel Shadwell Clerke, to the Secretaryship of the\r\nGrand Lodge of England, an office the duties of which he performs with\r\ngreat efficiency and courtesy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL AGRICULTURAL BENEVOLENT INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n_June 5th, 1875._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this Institution is to provide pensions for Farmers, their\r\nwives, widows, and unmarried orphan daughters. The Queen is patron, the\r\nDuke of Richmond is President, and the Earl of Northbrook, Chairman of\r\nthe Executive Council. At the present time (1888), 647 persons are\r\nmaintained at an annual cost of nearly £14,000. The Prince of Wales has\r\nalways been a generous friend and supporter of the charity. At the Royal\r\nAgricultural Show at Sandringham, in July, 1886, he called special\r\nattention to it, and pleaded for increased support, as is necessary from\r\nthe continued and increasing depression of agriculture. At the present\r\nmoment above 400 persons, who have cultivated holdings varying from 2000\r\nto 100 acres, are candidates for pensions, having been ruined through\r\nthe various causes of agricultural failure. During the past twenty-eight\r\nyears, about 1300 persons have been granted annuities, at a total\r\nexpenditure of £165,821.\r\n\r\nAt the fifteenth anniversary festival of the Institution, at Willis's\r\nRooms, on the 5th of June, 1875, the Prince of Wales presided. After\r\n\"The Queen,\" the patron of the charity, \"The health of the Prince with\r\nthat of the Princess of Wales and the Royal Family,\" was proposed by the\r\nEarl of Hardwicke, who said that the Prince of Wales had done them great\r\nhonour in presiding that evening. \"It was only another testimony of that\r\ninterest which he takes in the welfare of every portion of the\r\ncommunity. The position of the Prince of Wales was not one of the\r\neasiest. He has no definite duties, but the duty he has laid down for\r\nhimself is of a very definite nature. It is to benefit to the best of\r\nhis power all his fellow-creatures. He himself was not going to pass any\r\neulogiums on the Prince of Wales, although he had intimate knowledge of\r\nhis character and the privilege of his friendship. He would only say\r\nthat the Prince does credit to the very high position in which he is\r\nplaced, and that so long as he lays himself out to associate with\r\nEnglish people of all classes, and to faithfully discharge duties which,\r\nif not in themselves very agreeable, are beneficial to the English race,\r\nhe will be a popular and able Prince. A duty more wrapt up with sympathy\r\nthan that which the Prince that evening undertook could not be\r\nconceived. He tells the whole agricultural class of this country that he\r\nplaces himself at their disposal to further their interests and to help\r\nthem in their distress. So long as the Royal Family cling to the soil of\r\nthis country, and mix with its life and its sports and amusements, they\r\nwill never fail to receive the support of their countrymen in all times\r\nof trial.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was received with cheers, and the Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is difficult for me, gentlemen, to find words to express my\r\n    gratitude for the excessively kind manner in which my noble\r\n    friend has proposed this toast, and the cordial way in which you\r\n    have been kind enough to receive it. I need hardly tell you that\r\n    it affords me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction to occupy\r\n    the chair this evening. When I know those gentlemen who have\r\n    preceded me as your Chairmen, such as Mr. Disraeli, Lord Lytton,\r\n    the present Lord Derby, or the Duke of Richmond, I feel some\r\n    diffidence in addressing you this evening. At the same time I\r\n    think the proceedings of this evening will, as I hope, be short,\r\n    yet I trust they may be satisfactory to all here present.\r\n\r\n    \"I sincerely say that I do take a great interest in all that is\r\n    connected with agriculture. I may call myself a colleague of\r\n    many of you present as a farmer on a small scale, and I only\r\n    hope that I may never have occasion to be a pensioner of this\r\n    institution. It is impossible, I think, for any British\r\n    gentleman to live at his country place without taking an\r\n    interest in agriculture, and in all those things which concern\r\n    the farmers of this great country. I thank you also for the very\r\n    kind way in which you have mentioned the health of the Princess\r\n    of Wales and the rest of the Royal Family.\r\n\r\n    \"Before I sit down I beg to propose a toast--one which is never\r\n    left out at great gatherings of Englishmen, and which here ought\r\n    to be brought most prominently before your notice--'The Army,\r\n    Navy, Militia, and Reserve Forces.' The very backbone of the\r\n    country, the best recruits of the Army and Navy, come from the\r\n    agricultural districts. Since we know, also, that our commercial\r\n    and agricultural interests depend upon the valour and efficiency\r\n    of our land and sea forces, you will, I think, agree with me\r\n    that it is a toast especially for this meeting, one most\r\n    suitable for this agricultural feast. It is a toast which I feel\r\n    sure you all, gentlemen, will drink most heartily. With the Army\r\n    it gives me great pleasure to couple the name of General Sir W.\r\n    Knollys, and with the Navy that of Sir J. Heron Maxwell.\"\r\n\r\nSir W. Knollys, in responding for the profession to which he belongs,\r\nincluding the Militia, the Volunteers, and the Reserve Forces, dwelt\r\nupon the habits, the physical well-being, and powers of endurance which\r\nfit the agricultural population of this country for the profession of\r\narms. They bring with them also that contentment and discipline which\r\ntill recent events particularly distinguished the agricultural labourer,\r\nand are always ready to fight for country and Queen.\r\n\r\nSir J. Heron Maxwell having replied for the Navy, the toast-master, Mr.\r\nGoodchild, announced a bumper toast, and the Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"The toast which I now have the honour of proposing to you is\r\n    that of 'Success to the Royal Agricultural Benevolent\r\n    Institution.' Gentlemen, this excellent and charitable\r\n    institution has been only in existence for the space of fifteen\r\n    years, and its object is the relief of farmers who have been\r\n    reduced by failure of crops, loss of stock, bad seasons, and\r\n    other reasons. It has been founded, as I say, for that purpose,\r\n    but there is one thing which is absolutely necessary to entitle\r\n    to relief, and that is that the recipient of the pension must\r\n    have, as his exclusive means of support, cultivated at least\r\n    fifty acres, or rented land at £100 a year at least for twenty\r\n    years. And those farmers who receive pensions must prove to the\r\n    society that they do not possess an income from other sources of\r\n    more than £20 a year. Among those, also, who are benefited by\r\n    the society are the widows and children or orphans of farmers\r\n    and their unmarried daughters.\r\n\r\n    \"One main object of the managers of the institution is to\r\n    maintain in their own districts those who have not the means of\r\n    providing for themselves, so that, instead of their going to the\r\n    workhouse, or having to remove to distant parts of the kingdom,\r\n    they may be kept as much as possible in the counties where they\r\n    were born and bred. Pensions varying from £20 to £40 a year are\r\n    granted, and since the foundation of this society as many as 432\r\n    pensioners have been elected, and 53 children have been educated\r\n    and maintained at a cost of not far from £40,000. At present\r\n    there are 302 pensioners and 41 children on the books of the\r\n    charity, and these numbers will, I understand, be augmented\r\n    during the present month by the election of 51 pensioners. The\r\n    total cost of the year will be nearly £8500, and I am sorry to\r\n    say the donations and annual sums received amount to little over\r\n    £6800. Therefore, you see that although this institution is in a\r\n    highly prosperous state, at the same time the funds are not as\r\n    great as we could wish. It is for that reason that we assemble\r\n    here--to augment those funds.\r\n\r\n    \"When I look around and see so large a number of gentlemen, who\r\n    have come great distances to support me on this occasion, I feel\r\n    I shall not ask them in vain to extend their support to so\r\n    excellent an institution. You were kind enough just now to drink\r\n    in a cordial manner my health, but I think if I had put myself\r\n    before you as a surgeon whose health you were going to drink you\r\n    might not have received me so cordially. On this occasion I hope\r\n    you will look upon me as a surgeon. The few words I have to say\r\n    to you are my lancet, with which I have to bleed you--and you\r\n    will all feel much the better for it.\r\n\r\n    \"Many may think, 'Why should we give money to those who possibly\r\n    by their own fault may have got into distress?' But that is not\r\n    the object mentioned. All will agree that the cleverest\r\n    agriculturists who thoroughly understand their business may,\r\n    through bad seasons, failures of crops, and a variety of other\r\n    causes which you know, gentlemen, far better than I do, have\r\n    found themselves suddenly in the most abject want. It is a great\r\n    pity that the farmers' clubs and agricultural societies do not\r\n    do so much as they ought in support of so excellent an\r\n    institution.\r\n\r\n    \"I see by your applause it is only too true, and I must call\r\n    upon you this evening to show that you have supported this\r\n    charity in the most material manner. I thank you once more for\r\n    the kind and attentive manner in which you have listened to the\r\n    few words which I have uttered. I only regret that it has not\r\n    fallen to the lot of another than myself to bring the subject\r\n    before you, and I am sure that you will take the will for the\r\n    deed. 'Prosperity to the Royal Agricultural Benevolent\r\n    Institution!'\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with all the honours, and the Secretary, Mr. C.\r\nBousfield Shaw, read a list of subscriptions headed by the Queen with\r\n£25. The Prince of Wales gave, in addition to his annual subscription of\r\nten guineas, a donation of 100 guineas. The largest list of collections\r\nwas Mr. Naish's, of £465. The total amount was no less than £8000.\r\n\r\nMr. C. S. Read, M.P., then proposed the toast of \"The Executive Council,\r\nthe Secretary, and the Honorary Local Secretaries.\" In the course of his\r\nspeech, he remarked that it had been well said by His Royal Highness\r\nthat agriculture is exposed to more vicissitudes and difficulties than\r\nalmost any other industry, and it was surprising that it should have\r\nexisted so long without any benevolent institution. They must not forget\r\nin that room that they owed the fact that such an institution now exists\r\nto the kind and generous heart of their old friend, Mr. Mechi, the\r\nfounder of this society; and the tenant-farmers of England would never\r\nforget the day when the Heir Apparent to the Throne of England\r\ncondescended to preside at their annual banquet.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Huntly responded, and said as an example of the good done\r\nby active local energy, that in Cheshire they only had last year a\r\ndonation of ten guineas, and subscribers of thirty-one, while from\r\nNorfolk, the Prince's county, with a smaller agricultural population,\r\nthey had donations of £826.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales then said:--\r\n\r\n    \"The list of toasts which we all have before us has now come to\r\n    an end, but I shall take the liberty of proposing one more\r\n    toast, the last, but by no means the least. We have been\r\n    honoured on this occasion by fair ladies, and I think it would\r\n    be very wrong if we were to separate without cordially drinking\r\n    their health. We see especially how much the comfort, the\r\n    well-being, prosperity, and happiness of farmers and\r\n    agriculturists depend upon a kind wife to cheer them by the\r\n    fireside at the end of their day's work, and to lighten by\r\n    female influence the load of difficulties. It affords me the\r\n    most sincere pleasure to couple with this toast the name of one\r\n    to whom this institution is so much indebted--Mr. Mechi. Lord\r\n    Huntly has been mentioning to you the word 'energy'; and if it\r\n    had not been for the energy of Mr. Mechi this society would\r\n    never have existed. Let me also say, it would not be so\r\n    prosperous as it is now if it were not for those energies and\r\n    the assistance which he has given it. I hope the words and\r\n    expressions which the noble marquis has lately made use of will\r\n    not be lost by this company, and that all those who wish to\r\n    further the work so worthily begun by Mr. Mechi will continue\r\n    it, so that it may never decrease in funds for the excellent\r\n    object for which it is designed. I beg to propose the toast of\r\n    'The Ladies,' coupled with the name of Mr. Mechi.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mechi, in the course of his reply, said that the help of His Royal\r\nHighness would be of the greatest importance to the institution.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the Prince introduced the toast of the founder of the\r\nInstitution was in his happiest vein. Mr. Mechi's death was a great loss\r\nto the agricultural community, for no one more efficiently brought their\r\nclaims before the public. It may be added, that the tenant-farmers of\r\nthe kingdom have no truer friend than the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN EMBASSY.\r\n\r\n_November 1875-May 1876._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visit of the Prince of Wales to India, apart from what it brought of\r\npersonal information or amusement, must be regarded as one of the most\r\nimportant services he has yet rendered to the Empire. This is why we\r\ncall it an embassy rather than a tour or a journey. It appears that as\r\nfar back as the year 1858, the idea of a tour in the Eastern\r\npossessions of the Crown was suggested by Lord Canning to the Prince\r\nConsort, as part of the education of the Heir Apparent. But he was then\r\nonly seventeen, and the proposal was made merely as an incident of\r\nforeign travel. A succession of events, both at home and in the East,\r\ncaused the scheme to be postponed, nor was it seriously renewed till the\r\nPrince had attained an age, and acquired an experience in affairs, which\r\nwould secure for the expedition high consideration for political and\r\nimperial, as well as personal, purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1875 it was rumoured that the project was\r\nseriously entertained, and on the 16th of March the Marquis of Salisbury\r\nmade an official announcement to the Indian Council of the intended\r\nvisit. Many arrangements, however, had to be made, and many difficulties\r\nsurmounted, before actual preparations for the journey commenced. All\r\nthese are recounted in detail by Dr. W. H. Russell, in the introduction\r\nto his book on the 'Prince of Wales's Tour,' a reprint in expanded and\r\npermanent form of his letters as the special correspondent of the\r\n_Times_. Dr. Russell had the advantage of accompanying the Prince as one\r\nof his personal suite, under the title of Honorary Private Secretary. It\r\nis fortunate that the journey had such a historian. The work not only\r\ngives a Diary of the tour in India, with a full record of the\r\nproceedings of the Prince, but is in itself a most interesting and\r\ninstructive book of travel, full of information, conveyed in the graphic\r\nand bright style which has made the author famous as a man of letters.\r\nTo this book the reader of these pages is referred for the story of the\r\nRoyal expedition, both in India and in the countries through which he\r\npassed on the outward and homeward journey.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: 'The Prince of Wales's Tour: a Diary in India, with some\r\naccounts of the visits to the Courts of Greece, Egypt, Spain, and\r\nPortugal.' By William Howard Russell, LL.D. With illustrations by Sydney\r\nP. Hall. Sampson Low & Co.]\r\n\r\nThe Prince was fortunate in the companions of his journey, even to the\r\nhumbler and useful attendants. It is greatly to the credit of his\r\njudgment and his right feeling that the first to whom he expressed a\r\nwish to accompany him was Sir Bartle Frere, a wise and good man, and\r\nwhose Indian experience would be of immense value. In the suite there\r\nwere, of his own household, Lord Suffield, Sir Dighton Probyn, Colonel\r\nEllis, and Sir Francis Knollys. The Duke of Sutherland, Lord Alfred\r\nPaget, Lord Aylesford, Lord Carington, Colonel Owen Williams, Lord\r\nCharles Beresford, Captain Fitz George, were invited to join the\r\nexpedition. Canon Duckworth was selected as chaplain, and Sir Joseph\r\nPhayrer as physician; Mr. Albert Grey, secretary to Sir Bartle Frere,\r\nDr. Russell, and Mr. S. P. Hall as artist, completed the list of those\r\nwho formed the suite of His Royal Highness. Several of these--General\r\nProbyn, Colonel Ellis, and Dr. Phayrer--had long Indian experience; and\r\nLord Charles Beresford had accompanied the Duke of Edinburgh in his\r\nIndian tour the year before.\r\n\r\nThe route to be laid down required much consultation, partly from public\r\nconsiderations and partly from questions of climate and care for the\r\nPrince's health. The best time of starting had also to be considered. At\r\nlast all was arranged, and on the 11th of November the Prince started.\r\nThe route was to be viâ Brindisi, to Greece, Egypt, Bombay, Ceylon,\r\nMadras, Calcutta, Lucknow, Delhi, Lahore, Agra, Gwalior, Nepal,\r\nBareilly, Allahabad, Indore, Bombay, and home by Egypt, Malta,\r\nGibraltar, Spain, Portugal. The departure from Lisbon was on the 7th of\r\nMay, and on the 11th the _Serapis_ anchored off the Isle of Wight, where\r\nthe Princess of Wales and the children, in the _Enchantress_ yacht,\r\nawaited the arrival. \"The scene at the landing at Portsmouth,\" says Dr.\r\nRussell, \"was a becoming prelude to the greeting which the whole country\r\ngave the Prince of Wales on his return from the visit to India, which\r\nwill be for ever a great landmark in the history of the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe numerous and diverse events and incidents of the months in\r\nIndia--the sight-seeing, the adventures (some of them strange and\r\nperilous), the shooting parties and hunting expeditions, the manifold\r\namusements and excitements of travel--all these were enjoyed by the\r\nPrince as much as if he were only the most light-hearted tourist or\r\nkeenest sportsman. But at the same time, so far as official ceremony and\r\npublic affairs were concerned, he bore himself all through with a\r\nthoughtfulness and dignity worthy of his high position, and of the\r\nimportant mission with which he was entrusted as representing Royalty\r\nand the British nation.\r\n\r\nThere was ceremonial reception at Athens, and again in Egypt in the\r\ncourt of the Khedive, but the first official and formal event of the\r\nPrince's mission was the investiture of Prince Tewfik, the Viceroy's\r\neldest son, with the Order of the Star of India. This was done in the\r\npalace, with imposing ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe next official event was the reception of an address from the\r\ninhabitants of Aden, which was presented by a Parsee merchant, on behalf\r\nof the community. The address of the Parsee showed very clearly how well\r\nthe object of the Prince's visit was understood throughout the East. The\r\nPrince made an appropriate reply, which no doubt was speedily wired to\r\nBombay, and read in the native newspapers all over India.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Bombay it was again a Parsee who headed the first\r\ndeputation and read the first address to the Prince on landing in India.\r\nIt was from the Corporation of Bombay, the second city in the British\r\nEmpire, in population if not in wealth. The address set forth in glowing\r\nterms the historical and commercial claims of the city to distinction,\r\nand expressed the pleasure of seeing among them the heir to the Crown,\r\nwhom the Queen had sent to become personally acquainted with the people\r\nof India. The Prince replied in the following words:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is a great pleasure to me to begin my travels in India at a\r\n    place so long associated with the Royal Family of England, and\r\n    to find that during so many generations of British rule this\r\n    great port has steadily prospered. Your natural advantages would\r\n    have insured a large amount of commerce under any strong\r\n    Government, but in your various and industrious population I\r\n    gladly recognize the traces of a rule which gives shelter to all\r\n    who obey the laws; which recognizes no invidious distinctions of\r\n    race; which affords to all perfect liberty in matters of\r\n    religious opinion and belief; and freedom in the pursuit of\r\n    trade and of all lawful callings. I note with satisfaction the\r\n    assurance I derive from your address, that under British rule\r\n    men of varied creeds and nations live in harmony among\r\n    themselves, and develop to the utmost those energies which they\r\n    inherit from widely separate families of mankind, whilst all\r\n    join in loyal attachment to the British Crown, and take their\r\n    part, as in my native country, in the management of their own\r\n    local affairs.\r\n\r\n    \"I shall gladly communicate to Her Majesty what you so loyally\r\n    and kindly say regarding the pleasure which the people of India\r\n    derive from Her Majesty's gracious permission to me to visit\r\n    this part of Her Majesty's Empire. I assure you that the\r\n    Princess of Wales has never ceased to share my regret that she\r\n    was unable to accompany me. She has from her earliest years\r\n    taken the most lively interest in this great country, and the\r\n    cordiality of your greeting this day will make her yet more\r\n    regret the impossibility of her sharing in person the pleasure\r\n    your welcome afforded me.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply, so happily conceived, and delivered with quiet earnestness,\r\ndelighted all who heard it. But the echoes of it would soon reach every\r\npart of India, and the chiefs and rulers, and also the leaders of\r\nopinion in the native press, would from these words of the Prince\r\nreceive a lesson of true statesmanship and constitutional government.\r\n\r\nThe greatest event at Bombay was the reception of the Rulers and Chiefs\r\nof Western India, a scene of truly Oriental magnificence, the\r\ndescription of which forms one of the most brilliant chapters in Dr.\r\nRussell's book. All the established forms of Indian ceremony were\r\nobserved. The greatest rulers were saluted with the largest number of\r\nguns, the Maharajah of Mysore, for instance, having a salute of\r\ntwenty-one guns, while others were fifteen-gun chiefs or eleven-gun\r\nrajahs, as the case might be, according to the population and wealth of\r\nthe territories over which they ruled. Their dresses, and jewels, and\r\nretinues, and the modes of reception, as well as their personal\r\ncharacteristics, are all duly recorded. The Viceroy of India, Lord\r\nNorthbrook, was with the Prince of Wales at one grand Durbar, and his\r\nposition in regard to the Royal Envoy from the Queen, the arrangement of\r\nwhich had caused some difficulty in anticipation, was gracefully managed\r\nby the Viceroy and the Prince themselves. The Bombay Durbar passed off\r\nadmirably. It was the Prince's birthday, the 9th of November, and no\r\nsuch scene as on that day can he expect again to witness. The \"Carpet,\"\r\nwhich takes an important place in Oriental durbars, the nuzzars or gifts\r\nof homage, and other points of ceremonial, as well as the number of guns\r\nin the salute, had all been arranged by official notices to the\r\npolitical officers attached to the native courts. But the cordial\r\nbearing of the Prince, and his kindly words when he was told that any\r\nvisitors knew the English tongue, gave more satisfaction than the formal\r\nceremonials.\r\n\r\nA State banquet was given by the Governor in honour of the Prince's\r\nbirthday. In returning thanks for his health, proposed by the Governor,\r\nthe Prince made a short but telling speech. He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"It has long been my earnest wish--the dream of my life--to\r\n    visit India; and now that my desire has been gratified, I can\r\n    only say, Sir Philip Wodehouse, how much pleased I am to have\r\n    spent my thirty-fourth birthday under your roof in Bombay. I\r\n    shall remember with satisfaction the hospitable reception I have\r\n    had from the Governor, and all here, as long as I live, and I\r\n    believe that I may regard what I have experienced in Bombay as a\r\n    guarantee of the future of my progress through this great\r\n    Empire, which forms so important a part of the dominions of the\r\n    Queen.\"\r\n\r\nThese last words were a true forecast of the Royal progress throughout\r\nIndia. What has been said of Bombay, must serve to give an idea of what\r\neverywhere had to be recorded. But we must refrain from further details\r\nof what occurred at other Presidencies, and only add that the crowning\r\npublic event of the whole tour, the chief ceremony of the mission of the\r\nPrince, the holding the Chapter of the Order of the Star of India, came\r\noff, at Calcutta, on New Year's Day, 1876, with brilliant _éclat_.\r\n\r\nThis only may be said, that no more successful embassy than that\r\nundertaken by the Prince ever went forth from England. It may be added\r\nthat the great ends accomplished by it cost to the British Exchequer\r\nless than £60,000; and this, although no expense was spared in carrying\r\nout the mission with due display and munificence. Nor ought it to be\r\nomitted that the Prince was most generous, as he is at home, in his\r\ngifts to useful and charitable institutions, visited by him in the\r\ncourse of his journey. But we must leave the fascinating story of the\r\nIndian visit, to resume the record of the humbler, but not less\r\nhonourable duties, undertaken by the Prince after his return to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSED VICTUALLERS' ASYLUM.\r\n\r\n_May 7th, 1877._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Licensed Victuallers,\" as might be expected from so numerous,\r\nwealthy, and ancient a Corporation, possess several charitable\r\ninstitutions. They have a \"Permanent Fund,\" founded as far back as 1794,\r\nand incorporated in 1836, which grants weekly allowances to about two\r\nhundred and sixty persons, at an annual outlay of £4770; grants £300\r\nyearly for the maintenance of twelve children in the Society's School;\r\nand dispenses temporary relief amounting to £500. The School just named,\r\nfounded in 1803, situated in Kennington Lane, Lambeth, wholly maintains\r\nand educates 200 children of deceased or distressed members of the\r\nIncorporated Society of Licensed Victuallers. Its income from all\r\nsources averages £6000. Besides these charitable operations, there is\r\nthe Licensed Victuallers' Asylum, in the Old Kent Road, founded in 1827,\r\nand incorporated in 1836, for the reception and maintenance of decayed\r\naged licensed victuallers, their wives or widows, and for granting\r\nweekly allowances of money to fifty candidates, while waiting for the\r\nmore substantial benefits of the Society. The Asylum comprises 170\r\ndistinct houses, with a common library, a chapel and resident chaplain.\r\nThe property covers six acres of freehold land, and the annual expense\r\nis about £8500.\r\n\r\nIn support of this useful and well-managed Asylum, the Prince of Wales\r\npresided, at a special jubilee festival held on May the 7th, 1877. The\r\nDuke of Sussex was its first patron in 1827, and he was succeeded by the\r\nPrince Consort, on whose death the Prince of Wales assumed the office. A\r\nlarge number of influential persons accepted the invitation to be\r\npresent, including Earl Granville, several members of the House of\r\nPeers, many members of the House of Commons, and three Bishops, in all\r\nabout 300 supporters of the institution.\r\n\r\nAfter grace by the Bishop of Winchester, in whose diocese the Asylum is\r\nsituated, the Chairman rose to propose the usual opening toast of \"The\r\nQueen,\" saying that Her Majesty had always taken deep interest in this\r\nAsylum, and had sent £50 to its funds at one of its annual festivals.\r\nEarl Granville, in a genial and humorous speech, proposed the toast of\r\n\"The Prince and Princess of Wales and the rest of the Royal Family.\"\r\nThe noble Lord said he considered it a fortunate circumstance that he\r\nwas there that evening, because in the afternoon he met a friend, who\r\nsaid to him: \"You really don't mean to say you are going to dine with\r\nthose wicked people the licensed victuallers?\" Now, in arguing the case\r\nwith his friend, he did not go into the abstruse question whether all\r\npersons who dealt in articles of general demand and great consumption,\r\nuseful in themselves, and capable of being misapplied or abused, such as\r\nfood, or drink, or money, or physic, or a great many other things which,\r\nexcellent in themselves in a small quantity, might be most deleterious,\r\nwhen misapplied--were monsters. He satisfied himself with a much shorter\r\nanswer, which was that, as a study in human nature, it would be rather\r\ninteresting to see 300 monsters of iniquity assembled cordially to\r\npromote the work of genuine charity and benevolence. Having justified\r\nhis presence, he ventured to say that the toast he proposed would be\r\nreceived with the most unfeigned and genuine pleasure, since he had to\r\ngive \"The Health of the Prince, of the Princess of Wales, and the rest\r\nof the Royal Family.\" He might recommend it on the score of the high\r\nposition of the Chairman, which enabled him to influence so many for\r\ngood, or on the ground that the Prince and Princess are the most popular\r\ncouple in the country, and in all the vast dependencies of the British\r\nCrown. He might put it on the ground that the Prince shows that genial\r\nand cordial energy in anything which he undertakes, whether in\r\nprotecting the interests of British exhibitors on the Champs de Mars at\r\nParis, or in presiding in a work of charity and kindliness. He might\r\nalso recommend it in consequence of His Royal Highness being the very\r\nbest chairman of a public dinner. Instead of long speeches, His Royal\r\nHighness made addresses that were, to use a homely expression, as full\r\nof meat as an egg. But without using any arguments whatever, he would\r\ngive them \"The Health of the Prince and Princess, and the rest of the\r\nRoyal Family,\" and he was sure it would be received with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe band of the Grenadier Guards, under Mr. Dan Godfrey, played \"God\r\nBless the Prince of Wales,\" after which the Prince rose and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--I am excessively grateful to the noble\r\n    Earl for the most kind and flattering--I may say far too\r\n    flattering--terms in which he has been kind enough to propose my\r\n    health, that of the Princess, and the other members of my\r\n    family, and for the excessively cordial manner in which you have\r\n    been kind enough to receive it this evening. It is, no doubt,\r\n    somewhat unusual that the health of the Chairman should be given\r\n    at so early a period, but I am very grateful to the noble Earl\r\n    for the kind manner in which he has given it, and to you for\r\n    the way in which you have received it. Lord Granville has just\r\n    mentioned to you that this afternoon he was accosted by a\r\n    friend, who asked him why he was coming to-night, and expressed\r\n    some surprise at his doing so. Lord Granville was asked by one\r\n    friend. During the last three or four days I have received as\r\n    many as 200 petitions from bodies in all parts of the United\r\n    Kingdom begging me on no account to be present here this\r\n    evening. Of course, I do not wish in any way to disparage those\r\n    temperance societies, which have, no doubt, excellent objects in\r\n    view. But I think this time they have rather overshot the mark,\r\n    because the object of the meeting to-night is not to encourage\r\n    the love of drink, but to support a good and excellent charity.\r\n    I can only say, and I am sure all those here will agree with me,\r\n    that no one had the interest of all those in his adopted country\r\n    more at heart than my lamented father, and I feel perfectly\r\n    convinced that he would never have been the patron of the\r\n    society unless he was sure that it was one that was likely to do\r\n    good, and that it was deserving of his support. Lord Granville\r\n    has made far too flattering allusion to me as a Chairman, but as\r\n    he has been kind enough to say--giving me certainly a broad\r\n    hint--that speeches of this kind should be short, I am only too\r\n    happy to avail myself of it; and if brevity is the soul of wit,\r\n    I shall be the wittiest of chairmen.\r\n\r\n    \"Before sitting down I wish to bring to your notice a toast\r\n    which is always honoured with enthusiasm at every assemblage of\r\n    Englishmen. The toast is given, indeed, so often that it is\r\n    difficult to vary the manner of giving it, and especially at the\r\n    present moment I feel it would be unbecoming in me to dilate in\r\n    any way on the Army or the Navy. But at the present moment, when\r\n    the political horizon far away is so obscure, I feel sure that,\r\n    whatever may happen, it is the wish of all Englishmen that our\r\n    Army, though small, should be in the highest state of\r\n    efficiency, and that our Navy should be, as it ought to be, the\r\n    best in the world. I have lately returned from a short trip in\r\n    the Mediterranean, where I had the pleasure of spending ten days\r\n    in one of the finest men-of-war in Her Majesty's service; and\r\n    though the captain of that vessel is my own brother, I feel I\r\n    may say that there are few vessels which are in a better state\r\n    of order and discipline. And I think that if all the rest of\r\n    the Fleet are in the same state we shall have no cause to\r\n    complain of our Naval Service. With the Army and Reserve Forces\r\n    I beg to couple the name of General Sir W. Knollys, and with the\r\n    Navy that of Admiral Sir A. Milne, who for so long a time has\r\n    given his valuable services to the Admiralty.\"\r\n\r\nSir W. Knollys, in returning thanks, said that, in addition to\r\nintemperance in drink, there was such a thing as intemperance of the\r\nbrain and pen, and he had observed marks of that in some of the\r\ncommunications which, as a member of the Prince's household, he had had\r\nunder his notice during the last few days. Sir Alexander Milne also\r\nreturned thanks. The Prince of Wales then rose and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--The toast which I now give you is the\r\n    toast of the evening--'Renewed Prosperity to the Licensed\r\n    Victuallers' Asylum.' We are met here together to-night for the\r\n    purpose of doing honour to its 50th anniversary, and when I look\r\n    round me and see so numerous an assembly, I feel sure that we\r\n    shall have in every respect reason to be grateful for the bounty\r\n    of these gentlemen, who are prepared to do much towards\r\n    benefiting this excellent charitable institution. As everybody\r\n    is aware, it was founded as a refuge for the aged and decayed\r\n    members of the trade, so that they might be spared from dying of\r\n    hunger, or being thrown on the poor-rates as recipients of\r\n    parish relief.\r\n\r\n    \"The first stone of this Asylum was laid by my grand uncle, the\r\n    Duke of Sussex, and forty-three houses were then erected. Up to\r\n    the year 1835 lodging only was provided; but the Board of\r\n    Management then originated a fund which enabled them to maintain\r\n    the inmates as well. A weekly allowance in money and coals was\r\n    granted to these poor people.\r\n\r\n    \"In the year 1849 the applicants had become so numerous that it\r\n    was determined to erect an additional building. The first stone\r\n    of that building was laid by my lamented father, who again\r\n    performed a similar service when it was found necessary,\r\n    nineteen years ago, to enlarge still further this Asylum. In the\r\n    year 1866 my brother, the Duke of Edinburgh, laid the foundation\r\n    stone of another wing.\r\n\r\n    \"In the year 1863 I had the pleasure of becoming the Patron of\r\n    this Society, although in sad circumstances, in succession to\r\n    my father. I had great satisfaction also in assisting in the\r\n    ceremony of unveiling the statue which has been erected to the\r\n    memory of my father in the grounds of the Asylum. I believe I am\r\n    correct in stating that the institution now consists of about\r\n    170 separate habitations. The number of inmates is about 210,\r\n    who receive, the married couples, 10_s._, and the others, 8_s._\r\n    per week, besides coals, medical assistance, &c. The annual\r\n    expenses are very large, as they amount to upwards of £8000, and\r\n    as for the greater amount of that expenditure the Asylum is\r\n    dependent upon voluntary contributions, the Governors are most\r\n    anxious to collect now a sum which may be added to their capital\r\n    in order that they may feel that they have more certain sources\r\n    of income. I feel sure you will aid them, and I call upon you\r\n    once more to give most liberally all that is in your power to\r\n    give, and to show that you are anxious by pecuniary means as\r\n    well as by your presence here this evening to benefit the\r\n    institution. I will not weary you with any more words, because\r\n    no doubt at many other dinners the main facts of the case have\r\n    been brought before your notice. I will only say that it has\r\n    given me the greatest pleasure to take the chair this evening. I\r\n    thank you again for the cordial support which you have been kind\r\n    enough to give me, and I feel that now again I may call upon you\r\n    once more to do all in your power for the prosperity of the\r\n    Licensed Victuallers' Asylum.\"\r\n\r\nLord G. Hamilton, M.P., proposed the toast of \"The Stewards,\" Mr. E. N.\r\nBuxton, M.P., in acknowledging the toast, said they had no desire to\r\nclaim from His Royal Highness in any sense any appearance of taking\r\nsides on a question by his presence there that night. The kind words he\r\nhad spoken only showed his approval of the great principle that every\r\ntrade should provide for its poor and disabled members.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Institution read a list of subscriptions, headed\r\nwith an additional donation of 100 guineas from His Royal Highness,\r\nwhich was followed by large subscriptions from Messrs. Bass, Allsopp,\r\nHuggins, Mr. C. Sykes, M.P., and other gentlemen. The whole list\r\namounted to £5000.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the subject of intemperance has attracted more\r\nattention, and the crime and poverty resulting from drink has led to a\r\ngeneral consent of opinion that some greater regulation of the trade is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNVEILING ALBERT STATUE AT CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n_January 22nd, 1878._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election of His Royal Highness Prince Albert to the Chancellorship\r\nof the University of Cambridge, was one of the honours of which he was\r\nmost justly proud. He was only twenty-eight years of age, and had not\r\nyet been eight years in England. But during these years he had won the\r\nrespect and admiration of all that was highest and best in the nation.\r\nWhen the Chancellorship of Cambridge became vacant by the death of the\r\nDuke of Northumberland, on the 12th of February, 1847, application was\r\nmade to the Prince, on the next day, by Dr. Whewell, the Master of\r\nTrinity, to allow himself to be put in nomination for the office. The\r\nrequest was separately made by the Marquis of Lansdowne on the same day.\r\nA letter from the Bishop of London (Blomfield) conveyed the assurance\r\nthat the Prince's acceptance of the office would be regarded by many of\r\nthe leading members of the University, with whom he had conferred, as\r\n\"honourable and advantageous to the University.\" The Prince replied,\r\nthrough Mr. Anson, to whom the bishop's letter was addressed, that he\r\nwould be gratified by such a distinction, if it was the unanimous desire\r\nof the University.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there was another candidate proposed, and an election took\r\nplace, the Prince obtaining a large majority. Of 24 Professors who\r\nvoted, 16 gave their votes for the Prince; of 30 Senior Wranglers, 19\r\nwere on his side; while of the resident members 3 to 1 voted for him.\r\nNotwithstanding this strong expression of opinion, the Prince felt\r\ninclined to refuse the office, but was induced to accept it, on the\r\nreasons of the opposition being explained to him, and on the assurance\r\nthat the contest would be forgotten after a few months, and that he\r\nmight then count on the confidence and goodwill of the whole Academical\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nFortunately he accepted, and the assurances of his supporters were more\r\nthan verified. On the 24th of March the ceremony of inauguration was\r\ngone through at Buckingham Palace, when the Letters-Patent ware\r\npresented to the Prince by the Vice-Chancellor, accompanied by the most\r\ndistinguished officials, and about one hundred and thirty members of the\r\nUniversity. How soon and how powerfully his influence was felt in\r\nadvancing education at Cambridge, is matter of history. The following\r\nsimple entry in his Diary, on the 1st of November, 1848, shows the\r\nresult of his first efforts: \"My plan for a reform of the studies at\r\nCambridge is carried by a large majority.\" To the enlightened and\r\njudicious plans of the Prince the subsequent advances and extension of\r\neducation in England have been largely due. Nowhere was this more\r\ngratefully acknowledged than at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nDuring his life he was honoured, and after his death a statue was\r\nerected to his memory, chiefly by subscriptions from the University. The\r\nsite chosen was in the Fitzwilliam Museum, a memorial worthy of the\r\nnoble benefactor, who bequeathed to the University his valuable\r\ncollection of pictures and books, with a sum of £100,000 to be spent in\r\nproviding a building suitable for their reception. The statue of Prince\r\nAlbert was here fittingly placed. It was one of the best works of Mr.\r\nFoley, in his later years, and is universally admired as a striking and\r\nworthy representation of the illustrious Chancellor.\r\n\r\nIt was for the ceremony of unveiling this statue that the Prince of\r\nWales visited Cambridge on the 22nd of January, 1878. He was met at the\r\ngate of the Museum by the Chancellor, the Duke of Devonshire, the Lord\r\nHigh Steward, the Vice-Chancellor, and a distinguished company. On\r\nentering the vestibule an address was read by the Chancellor, setting\r\nforth the services to the University of the Prince Consort, during his\r\nfifteen years' tenure of office. The address thus concluded:--\r\n\r\n\"This memorial of the Prince Consort cannot but serve to remind us also\r\nas Englishmen of the signal benefits conferred by His Royal Highness\r\nupon our Queen and country by his wise and far-seeing counsels, his\r\nnever-wearying vigilance and attention to the public welfare, and his\r\nentire devotion to the duties of his exalted station at the sacrifice of\r\nall personal interests and objects.\r\n\r\n\"We thank your Royal Highness for the distinguished honour conferred\r\nupon the University by your presence among us this day. It remains only\r\nfor us to prefer our request that your Royal Highness will now be\r\ngraciously pleased to uncover the statue. To no one does this honourable\r\noffice more appropriately belong.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales returned the following reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Duke, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Members of the Senate, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--I thank you for your address. I feel that it is\r\n    hardly necessary for me to assure you what pleasure it affords\r\n    me to be present on this occasion for the purpose of unveiling\r\n    the statue of my illustrious father and your late Chancellor, in\r\n    compliance with the special desire and invitation of the\r\n    Chancellor and the Members of the Senate of the University. But,\r\n    apart from the performance of this duty, I must express my great\r\n    satisfaction at having an opportunity of revisiting Cambridge as\r\n    a member of your University, and recalling to my mind the\r\n    agreeable recollections which I have always retained of my\r\n    undergraduate's days. The interest which the Prince Consort took\r\n    in everything relating to the welfare of the University is well\r\n    known to us all, and it is a source of deep gratification to me\r\n    to witness the respect which the members of the University show\r\n    to his memory by the erection of this fine statue. I will now\r\n    proceed to execute the task imposed upon me of unveiling the\r\n    statue.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince then walked up to the Statue, and having pulled a string, it\r\nstood unveiled before the assembly, who contemplated it for a few\r\nmoments in silence.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor again addressing the Prince, thanked him for the honour\r\nwhich he had done the University in being present on so interesting an\r\noccasion. It was, however, a source of regret to him that so many had\r\npassed away who had the best means of becoming acquainted with the views\r\nand thoughts of the Prince Consort--such as Professor Sedgwick and Dr.\r\nWhewell--who, if they were alive, would gladly have borne testimony to\r\nhis great virtues that day. There were, however, many now in that hall\r\nwho, he had no doubt, entertained the liveliest recollections of the\r\ndeep interest which was taken by His Royal Highness in the work in which\r\nthe University was engaged.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Powis also bore testimony to the unwearied interest which\r\nwas taken by the Prince Consort in the development of new studies in the\r\nUniversity, even amid the weighty cares of State.\r\n\r\nDr. G. Paget, Regius Professor of Physic, spoke in highly eulogistic\r\nterms of the Prince Consort's love of science and art, observing that it\r\nwas under his auspices that the Moral and Natural Science Triposes had\r\nbeen established, to the great advantage of teaching in the University.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony in the entrance-hall was thus brought to a close, and the\r\nPrince of Wales, the Chancellor, and their respective suites proceeded\r\nto the picture gallery, where His Royal Highness held a _levée_, which\r\nwas very numerously attended. After the _levée_ he returned to Trinity\r\nCollege. It was several years since the Prince of Wales had paid a visit\r\nto Cambridge of any duration. He spent some time there as an\r\nunder-graduate, and made with the Princess of Wales a stay of three days\r\nin 1864, when he had the degree of LL.D. conferred upon him.\r\n\r\nAnother memorable visit was paid on the 9th of June, 1888, when the\r\nPrince of Wales, accompanied by the Princess and their three daughters,\r\nwitnessed the conferring of an honorary degree on Prince Albert Victor.\r\nOther notable graduates _honoris causâ_ were on the list that day,\r\nincluding the Marquis of Salisbury, the Earl of Rosebery, Lord Selborne,\r\nMr. Balfour, Mr. Goscheu, and Professor Stokes. At the luncheon\r\nafterwards given in the Fitzwilliam Museum, the Prince of Wales said it\r\nwas seven and twenty years since he was first connected with the\r\nUniversity. \"They were happy days,\" he added, \"and I always look back to\r\nthem with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINFANT ORPHAN ASYLUM, WANSTEAD.\r\n\r\n_June 28th, 1878._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis institution maintains and educates the orphans of persons once in\r\nprosperity, from earliest infancy till fourteen or fifteen years of age.\r\nAbout 60 children are now (1888) annually elected. Nearly the whole of\r\nthe income depends on voluntary contributions. Subscribers have votes,\r\naccording to the amount of their subscriptions. There are now nearly 600\r\nin the Asylum, which is open to children from all parts of the British\r\ndominions. The Asylum stands in beautifully wooded grounds, at Wanstead,\r\non the outskirts of Epping Forest.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, accompanied by the Princess of Wales, presided at the\r\nanniversary festival, on June 28th, 1878. They drove to Wanstead, and\r\nwere received at the Asylum by the Bishop of St. Albans, in whose\r\ndiocese it is, and by the officers of the institution. They were\r\nconducted to the Examination Room, where, Dagmar Mary Petersen, a little\r\norphan girl, eight years old, daughter of a Dane, who settled in London\r\nas a commercial clerk, herself admitted just eighteen months ago by the\r\nloyalty of a lady of the Society of Friends, who wished thus to honour\r\nthe Princess, commenced the proceedings with a pretty speech which she\r\nhad got perfectly by heart and recited very clearly. In her childish\r\nvoice she gave those assembled a distinct account of the asylum. \"She\r\nhad been told that it was the largest of the kind in England. When the\r\nboys, girls, officers, and servants are all there, 700 persons sleep in\r\nthe building. The schools are in three divisions, senior, infants, and\r\nnursery children. In the two large senior schools there are about 400\r\nboys and girls. They learn grammar, history, geography, arithmetic,\r\nFrench, music, and drawing, and the girls learn needlework besides. In\r\nthe two infant schools they do not learn quite so much. In the nursery\r\nthey learn just a very little and play a good deal. And being little\r\nchildren they learn about the Bible.\" The little girl who spoke this\r\nsimple address presented a bouquet to the gracious Princess after the\r\nceremony, and was kissed, praised, and otherwise gratified.\r\n\r\n\"God bless the Prince of Wales\" was excellently sung at the conclusion\r\nof the speech; the children came up to the Princess and took their\r\nprizes from her hands; and marched out of the room, keeping time to\r\nlively music. The Royal party inspected the school-rooms, play-rooms,\r\nand dormitories, cheerful and well-ventilated halls; and the Princess\r\ncarried toys to the children in the nursery.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales took the chair at luncheon, supported by the\r\nPrincess of Wales, and their suite, the Duke and Duchess of Manchester,\r\nthe Bishop of St. Albans and Hon. Mrs. Claughton, and a large assembly.\r\nAfter grace the Prince of Wales rose and proposed \"The Health of Her\r\nMajesty the Queen.\" The toast-master next announced a bumper toast, and\r\nthe Duke of Manchester gave \"The Health of His Royal Highness the Prince\r\nof Wales, and the Princess of Wales,\" \"a toast which is never more\r\nheartily honoured than on these fortunately frequent occasions, when\r\ntheir Royal Highnesses patronize and encourage well-organized charitable\r\ninstitutions, among which this was perhaps one of the best he knew.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales said, in reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ladies and Gentlemen,--On the part of the Princess and myself,\r\n    we beg to return our warmest thanks to the noble duke for the\r\n    kind way in which he has proposed this toast, and to you, ladies\r\n    and gentlemen, for the cordial manner in which you have received\r\n    it. It has afforded both the Princess and myself the greatest\r\n    possible pleasure and the greatest possible gratification to\r\n    come here to-day and to inaugurate the fifty-first anniversary\r\n    of this excellent and commendable institution. What we have seen\r\n    ourselves, and what the most part of the company have witnessed\r\n    on their own part, I think will do more than anything I can say\r\n    to show you what an excellent institution this is, and how\r\n    worthy it is of support in every way. The manner in which the\r\n    children sang, the discipline under which they are evidently\r\n    kept, the clean and healthy appearance of all of them, is a\r\n    matter of sincere congratulation to all those who take interest\r\n    in this institution or have the trouble of its management. I may\r\n    say that there is one little girl who perfectly astonished us by\r\n    the elocution which she possessed--well worthy of many a\r\n    distinguished member of Parliament.\r\n\r\n    \"It was highly interesting to the Princess, as well as to\r\n    myself, to have been here to-day, the fortieth anniversary of\r\n    the Queen's Coronation. The first stone of the building in which\r\n    we are now was laid by my lamented father a few months before I\r\n    was born; and I hold in my hand the mallet which was used by him\r\n    on that occasion, and which has been sent to me by Sir Charles\r\n    Reed, the chairman of the London School Board, whose father, Dr.\r\n    Andrew Reed, was, I understand, one of the promoters of this\r\n    institution, and always took the warmest interest in its\r\n    welfare. This day seventeen years ago the Prince Consort visited\r\n    this institution, and this day exactly twelve years ago was the\r\n    last time the Princess and I were here.\r\n\r\n    \"I am sure there is but little more for me to say in commending\r\n    so admirable an institution to you, which has now existed for\r\n    half a century, which maintains 600 children during the course\r\n    of the year, and has educated and sent forth into the world as\r\n    many as 3000 up to the present time. But a well-managed\r\n    institution like this, with the spacious rooms which we have\r\n    seen, will naturally convince you that it must cost a\r\n    considerable sum, and I believe I am not incorrect in stating\r\n    that it requires at least £18,000 a year to maintain this\r\n    asylum. And as it is almost entirely supported by voluntary\r\n    contributions I feel sure that all those present will do all\r\n    they can to support this institution, and to tell their friends\r\n    when they go home how worthy it is of support. I have now, in\r\n    conclusion, only to propose--a toast which I give most\r\n    heartily--'Prosperity to the Infant Orphan Asylum.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales then left the chair, resigning it to the Bishop of\r\nSt. Albans, who gave the other usual toasts.\r\n\r\nThe secretary read a list of subscriptions. The Queen had sent her\r\nannual donation of 10 guineas; the Prince of Wales before leaving placed\r\nin the hands of the secretary a cheque for 100 guineas; the Duke of\r\nEdinburgh gave 10 guineas; H. S. C. (who had long been an anonymous\r\nbenefactress), 100 guineas; country friends, £462. In all, about £1600.\r\n\r\nThis concluded the formal proceedings, but the summer weather tempted\r\nmany of the visitors to prolong their stay in the pleasant gardens of\r\nthe asylum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING SHIP 'BRITANNIA.'\r\n\r\n_July 24th, 1878._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1877, the Prince of Wales went to Dartmouth, to place\r\nhis sons, Prince Edward (as he was then usually called) and Prince\r\nGeorge, on the training ship _Britannia_, under the care of Captain\r\nFairfax, R.N. At the end of the summer term, in the following year, the\r\nPrince consented to preside at the distribution of prizes on the\r\n_Britannia_, and graciously announced that the successful pupils should\r\nreceive their medals and books from the hands of the Princess of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor and Corporation of the ancient borough of Dartmouth took\r\nadvantage of the occasion to give official welcome to the Royal\r\nvisitors, and to present an address, which the Prince signified his\r\nreadiness to receive on board the Royal yacht, _Osborne_. Thither the\r\nmagistrates repaired in the forenoon. The picturesque estuary of the\r\nriver Dart never had displayed so festive an appearance. The\r\n_Britannia_, and her attendant yacht the _Sirius_, the Royal yacht, the\r\nAdmiralty yacht, which had brought the Lords of the Admiralty, several\r\nships of the Plymouth fleet, under Admiral Sir Thomas Symonds, besides a\r\nlarge flotilla of yachts, steam launches, and all sorts of boats, were\r\ncovered with gay bunting, while flags floated from every point of the\r\nshore and the town.\r\n\r\nThe Town Clerk having read the Address from the ancient borough, which\r\nwas first incorporated by a charter of Edward III., in 1342, and had\r\nfigured in subsequent history, especially at the time of the Spanish\r\nArmada, the Prince, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"On behalf of the Princess of Wales, as well as on my own\r\n    behalf, I offer my sincere thanks to you for your address and\r\n    for your cordial welcome to us on our visit to this ancient and\r\n    beautiful town. The salubrity of the climate of Dartmouth and\r\n    the excellence of your sanitary arrangements have long been\r\n    known to me, and I can appeal to no better proof of my entire\r\n    confidence in them than that afforded by the step I have taken\r\n    in sending our two sons to be educated on board the _Britannia_.\r\n    I beg to assure you that with that step both the Princess and\r\n    myself are perfectly satisfied. I trust you will continue to\r\n    devote your attention as you have done in the past to the\r\n    improvement of the sanitary arrangements of the town. I thank\r\n    you again for the kind wishes you have expressed towards the\r\n    Princess, myself, and our family.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince also congratulated the Mayor, Sir Henry Seale, on the\r\nsplendid effect of the illuminations of the previous evening.\r\nAccompanied by the Municipal authorities, and by the Duke of Connaught,\r\nPrince Louis of Battenberg, and a numerous retinue, the Prince and\r\nPrincess then proceeded to the _Britannia_ for the distribution of the\r\nprizes. They were received by Mr. W. H. Smith, then First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, and the other Lords; by the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nPlymouth division of the Channel Fleet; and Captain Fairfax of the\r\n_Britannia_. Between 500 and 600 of the friends or relatives of the\r\ncadets, and other invited guests, among whom were Lord and Lady Charles\r\nBeresford, Sir Samuel and Lady Baker, were assembled on the\r\nquarter-deck, sheltered from the sun by a canopy of flags, surmounted by\r\nthe flag of Denmark, and the white ensign of England.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the prizes took place, a report on the state of the\r\ntraining having been previously read by Dr. Hirst, director of studies\r\nat the Greenwich Naval College, who had superintended the examination of\r\nthe cadets.\r\n\r\nAfter the distribution, the Prince of Wales, standing on the deck in the\r\nuniform of a captain of the Royal Naval Reserve, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--Permit me to express to you\r\n    the great pleasure it has given the Princess to present the\r\n    cadets who are about to leave the _Britannia_ the prizes which\r\n    they have so successfully won, and to express to you on my own\r\n    part as well as on that of the Princess the very great pleasure\r\n    it has given us to be here to witness and take part in these\r\n    interesting proceedings. From Dr. Hirst we heard a most\r\n    interesting and exhaustive speech regarding the studies of the\r\n    cadets and their merits. I can only wish those who are about to\r\n    leave the _Britannia_, and who have now fairly entered that\r\n    noble service for which they have been trained, all possible\r\n    success. Let me hope that the tuition they have received here\r\n    will not be thrown away upon them, and that they may all emulate\r\n    those bright examples to be found in English history and of\r\n    which every naval officer must be proud. To those cadets who\r\n    still remain on board this ship I can only recommend strict\r\n    assiduity to their studies and strict obedience to discipline,\r\n    and all of them to try to pass out of the _Britannia_ as highly\r\n    as they can, remembering, above all, that saying which one of\r\n    our greatest admirals has handed down to posterity--'England\r\n    expects every man will do his duty.' A personal interest which\r\n    the Princess and myself take in this ship and the confidence we\r\n    have of its being an excellent practical school for boys have\r\n    been testified by the fact that we have sent our two sons among\r\n    you to be educated. For myself, my only hope and trust is that\r\n    they may do credit to the ship and to their country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. W. H. Smith, M.P., First Lord of the Admiralty, thanked their Royal\r\nHighnesses for their welcome presence, and called upon the cadets to\r\ngive three cheers for the Prince and Princess of Wales. The cheers were\r\nprolonged to three times three, caught up in row-boats around, and\r\nechoed by the high banks of the Dart. The chief captains of the cadets,\r\nwho are mainly responsible for discipline and occupy a place of honour\r\nin the ship's mess-room on the main deck, were presented to the Prince\r\nand Princess, and the proceedings came to an end. Captain and Mrs.\r\nFairfax had the honour of entertaining the Royal personages and a select\r\nparty at luncheon. Later in the day the Prince of Wales paid a visit to\r\nCaptain Zirzow, on the German Imperial frigate _Niobe_, and drank a\r\nglass of wine to the health of the Emperor of Germany. Captain Zirzow\r\ntelegraphed at once to the Emperor that the Prince of Wales had called a\r\nhealth to him.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince and Princess arrived at Dartmouth on Tuesday they were\r\nrowed to the _Britannia_, one of their sons steering and the other\r\npulling the second bow oar. They left the ship in a boat rowed by\r\nfull-grown sailors, and with their two sons, who were going home for\r\ntheir holidays, sitting in the stern sheets. From the _Britannia_ to the\r\nlanding-place, which was brightly draped with crimson cloth, hawsers\r\nwere stretched and thus a clear lane was kept among the crowd of craft\r\nfor the passage of the Royal boat. Tho cadets of the _Britannia_ sat in\r\ntheir blue coats with tossed oars, and cheers were raised by those on\r\nthe boats, yachts, the many little steam launches, and the shore. Little\r\ngirls threw flowers before the Princess as she stepped upon the landing\r\nstage. A special train was waiting to meet the ordinary mail from\r\nPenzance and Plymouth.\r\n\r\nSo ended a visit which formed an interesting incident in the family life\r\nof the Prince, and the events of which will long be remembered in South\r\nDevon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCABDRIVERS' BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n_May 5th, 1879._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objects of the Cabdrivers Benevolent Association are: 1, to give\r\nannuities of £20 a year; 2, to grant small loans; 3, to give temporary\r\nassistance in cases of urgent distress; 4, to assist the widows and\r\norphans of cabmen. This is an institution the benefits of which are so\r\nobvious, and for the help of a class of men so hard-worked, so\r\nuncertainly paid, and so useful to the public, that we are not surprised\r\nat the readiness with which the Prince of Wales assented to preside at\r\none of its annual festivals, and at the hearty earnestness in which he\r\nmade an appeal on its behalf. It was at the festival dinner on the 5th\r\nof May, 1879. On coming to the toast of the evening His Royal Highness\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"There is, I think, no class of our fellow-countrymen that\r\n    deserve more of our consideration than the cabdrivers of this\r\n    great city, and it has already been truly expressed to you that\r\n    one cannot think without pity of those poor men sitting on their\r\n    cabs in the cold east winds with which we are, alas! so well\r\n    acquainted, and in the rain and snow which have been our lot now\r\n    for so many months.\r\n\r\n    \"They are as a rule, I believe, a class honest, persevering, and\r\n    industrious. For them I have to plead to-night, and for this\r\n    excellent institution, which has for the last nine years\r\n    rendered to them such great benefits.\r\n\r\n    \"The objects of this Cabdrivers' Benevolent Association are, as\r\n    you are aware, threefold--first, to give annuities at the rate\r\n    of £12 each to aged cabdrivers or to those who from infirmity\r\n    are unable to earn their living; secondly, to grant loans\r\n    without interest to members requiring such aid, and to give\r\n    temporary assistance to those who may be in distress through\r\n    unavoidable causes; and, thirdly, to give legal assistance to\r\n    members who may be unjustly summoned to the police courts. It is\r\n    hardly possible to conceive that any benevolent institution of\r\n    this kind is more deserving of support, not only by the large\r\n    assembly who are gathered here, but by the inhabitants generally\r\n    of our great Metropolis. There are a thousand cabmen who are\r\n    members of this Association, and they pay 5_s._ a year. Pensions\r\n    of £12 are granted now to old and indigent cabdrivers, but it is\r\n    our great wish to augment that sum to £16\" (now £20). \"The\r\n    system of loans seems to have answered admirably in every\r\n    respect; £600 has been granted to the members without interest,\r\n    and these loans have, I understand, been always most regularly\r\n    and most punctually repaid. Two hundred and thirty-three cabmen\r\n    or their families have been assisted by this society in various\r\n    years since its formation, and its existing capital is more than\r\n    £3000; but this we hope to augment still further.\r\n\r\n    \"One statement I may make which may be of interest to those\r\n    present here this evening. I mentioned that as a class the\r\n    cabmen are thoroughly honest. As a proof of that I have\r\n    statistics here before me which state that last year there were\r\n    between 16,000 and 17,000 articles left in cabs, amounting in\r\n    value to about £20,000, which have been punctually returned. I\r\n    believe, at least it is the popular belief, that there is only\r\n    one article a cabman never returns, and this is an umbrella, and\r\n    I think that is, we may consider, quite fair. A gentleman having\r\n    an umbrella may not want a cab, but without an umbrella he will\r\n    be compelled to take a cab if the rain comes on!\r\n\r\n    \"There are now between 11,000 and 12,000 cabmen, and the amount\r\n    of the expense in cab fares comes to a most colossal sum,\r\n    something between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 sterling. With\r\n    regard to the remark I made as to the honesty of cabmen, it may\r\n    perhaps be not out of place if I mention an anecdote which was\r\n    told me to-day. A gentleman drove in a cab to a shop, left the\r\n    cab, and entered the shop. On coming out of the shop, he was not\r\n    in so quiet a frame of mind as when he entered it; it was\r\n    evident to the passers-by that he was dissatisfied with the\r\n    shopman; he left the shop and went away. The shopman threw a\r\n    case into the cab. The gentleman had forgotten it. But the\r\n    cabman immediately drove to Scotland Yard and delivered the\r\n    case, which was found to contain jewellery worth £2300. This\r\n    will give you some idea of the honesty of these men, for whom we\r\n    are endeavouring to do much. Some considerable good was done\r\n    only four years ago by a philanthropic and noble lord whose name\r\n    is known to you, who started cabmen's shelters. There are now\r\n    twenty of these, and they shelter 2000 cabmen, doing much to\r\n    alleviate the discomfort of the men, who sit so many hours of\r\n    the night suffering from the inclemency of the seasons.\r\n\r\n    \"When I see this large assemblage I feel I shall not call in\r\n    vain, and I call upon you to augment the capital which already\r\n    exists. With this toast I have great pleasure in associating one\r\n    who is treasurer of the Association, Lord Richard Grosvenor (now\r\n    Lord Stalbridge), member of a family well known in works of\r\n    charity and philanthropy. I thank you for the kind way in which\r\n    you have listened to my imperfect remarks, and now I must ask\r\n    you to drink with enthusiasm 'Success to the Cabdrivers'\r\n    Benevolent Association!'\"\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to find from the latest published report that the\r\nInstitution, which the Prince of Wales so warmly commended, is in a\r\nprosperous condition. The annuities have been raised to £20, and there\r\nare 40 annuitants now on the books. The receipts in 1887 were £2191, and\r\nthe funded property was £10,000. Temporary relief was given to upwards\r\nof 200 cabmen. Upwards of 1200 members contribute 5_s._ annually, but\r\nthis is a small proportion of the whole number of cabdrivers, more of\r\nwhom ought to be persuaded to join as members, as they alone receive the\r\nbenefits of the Association. The applicants for loans, on the prescribed\r\nterms, were 89. The cabmen have been fortunate in the chairmen at the\r\nfestivals and annual general meetings. The Prince of Wales is patron of\r\nthe Association. The honorary secretary is G. Stormont Murphy, Esq., and\r\nthe office is at 15, Soho Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCESS HELENA COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n_May 23rd, 1880._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales presided at Willis's Rooms at a dinner in aid of the\r\nfunds of the Princess Helena College, on the 23rd of May, 1880.\r\n\r\nAfter the customary proceedings and toasts of the evening, and speeches\r\nby the Duke of Cambridge and Lord Sydney, the Prince rose and proposed\r\nthe toast of \"Prosperity to the Princess Helena College.\" He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"At many of the dinners at which I have the pleasure of taking\r\n    the chair, the charities in support of which they are given\r\n    require more words to bring them to the notice of those who\r\n    attend than the present one does. But though the specific nature\r\n    of this institution relieves me from the necessity of entering\r\n    upon any lengthened advocacy of its claims, it is not the less\r\n    deserving of your hearty support in every respect. As you are\r\n    aware, the Princess Helena College was formerly called the Adult\r\n    Orphan Institution, and it has for its object the bringing up of\r\n    daughters of officers of the Army and Navy and of clergymen. Its\r\n    first meeting took place as far back as 1818, and in 1820 the\r\n    institution was built. As Lord Sydney told you, it originated\r\n    with a relative of his own. It was founded by her, and by my\r\n    grand-aunt, Princess Augusta of Gloucester. King George IV. also\r\n    took great interest in its welfare, allotting the plot of ground\r\n    in the Regent's Park where the College now stands.\r\n\r\n    \"The object of the institution is not only to provide a\r\n    thoroughly good education for the daughters of officers and\r\n    clergymen, but to send them forth into the world in a useful\r\n    capacity; and I think you will agree with me that in the\r\n    capacity of well-qualified governesses they go forth in the most\r\n    useful manner. In the days when it was first instituted so much\r\n    attention was not given to education as in our time, and you\r\n    can therefore easily understand that as more highly efficient\r\n    education is needed now for these young ladies there is a\r\n    proportionate increase of expense. Like many other institutions,\r\n    its expenditure has been greater than its receipts, and, as a\r\n    consequence, it has been found necessary to somewhat alter its\r\n    rules by admitting a certain number of paying students as\r\n    boarders, and also by establishing day classes for the daughters\r\n    of gentlemen. In order to fit the institution for this new\r\n    sphere of operations it has been necessary to enlarge the\r\n    building, and though, no doubt, the effect of this arrangement\r\n    will be to increase receipts, the enlargement of the building\r\n    has naturally entailed great cost, and in order to meet that\r\n    charge I have to call upon you, gentlemen, to do all you can, by\r\n    a most liberal contribution to-night, to enable the committee to\r\n    meet their pecuniary difficulties. The best proof you can give\r\n    me of the real interest you take in the welfare of this\r\n    excellent institution will be to subscribe as handsomely as it\r\n    is in your power to do. I am informed that a distinguished naval\r\n    officer is acting as steward here to-night in gratitude for the\r\n    benefit his daughters have derived in their education from a\r\n    governess who was brought up at the Princess Helena College. I\r\n    have mentioned before that the Queen is its patron. Her Majesty\r\n    subscribes £50 a year to its funds, and on this special occasion\r\n    she presents 100 guineas. The interest taken by my sister, the\r\n    Princess, in its welfare is sufficiently proved by the fact that\r\n    she is President of the Council of the College, and I have great\r\n    pleasure in stating to you that it is by her express wish and\r\n    recommendation that I am here to-night. I will, in conclusion,\r\n    again ask you to let me feel by the liberality of your\r\n    contributions that I have not failed in my duty as your\r\n    Chairman.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary then read a list of donations and subscriptions, which,\r\nincluding those from the Queen and 100 guineas from the Prince of Wales,\r\namounted to over £2060.\r\n\r\nThe College still flourishes at Ealing, a populous district, where day\r\nboarders are also admitted to the classes of the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW HARBOUR AT HOLYHEAD.\r\n\r\n_June 17th, 1880._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo possess the best possible packet service between England and Ireland\r\nis a matter of national importance. In the old days of sailing ships the\r\nperils and uncertainties of the passage across the Channel were\r\nnotorious. When steamships carried mails and passengers, and when the\r\nbridging of the Menai Straits for railway traffic had been achieved, it\r\nwas necessary to provide improved harbour accommodation, and other\r\nworks, both for convenience and safety, at Holyhead. These works\r\nincluded a spacious harbour, and a breakwater securing the additional\r\nspace of a sheltered roadstead. The length of the North Breakwater is\r\nnearly 8000 feet. The harbour and deep-water sheltered roadstead are\r\ntogether between six and seven hundred acres in extent. It took\r\ntwenty-five years to carry out the design, at a cost of about\r\n£1,500,000. This outlay included the works and buildings for Government\r\nuse in the postal service. The engineer-in-chief was Mr. James Rennel,\r\nand on his death, in 1856, Mr. afterwards Sir John Hawkshaw.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the completion of the works, the Prince of Wales visited\r\nHolyhead on the 19th of August, 1873, when he declared the Breakwater\r\ncomplete and the Harbour of Refuge open. The Duke of Edinburgh, Master\r\nof the Trinity House, Sir Frederick Arrow, Deputy Master, and many\r\ndistinguished representatives of various departments of the public\r\nservice assisted at the ceremony. Near the Lighthouse a gun-metal plate\r\nrecords the fact that the Breakwater, \"commenced in 1845, was on August\r\n19th, 1873, declared complete, by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales,\" in\r\nwhose public life the proceedings of the day form a memorable event.\r\n\r\nBut there was yet much to be done for the Anglo-Irish route, viâ\r\nHolyhead. The communication had so increased that the North Western\r\nRailway Company found enlarged harbour accommodation a necessity for the\r\nbenefit of their own traffic.\r\n\r\nIt is not often that Royal sanction is given to the undertakings of\r\nshareholding companies; but the new harbour at Holyhead, while it was\r\nconstructed at the cost and for the benefit of the London and North\r\nWestern Railway Company, has so much importance for commerce and\r\ntraffic, as to make it a national object. The Prince of Wales was\r\naccordingly asked to inaugurate the new harbour, and a large number of\r\ndistinguished and official persons were invited by the Directors to be\r\npresent on the occasion. At the luncheon, the Chairman of the Company\r\nproposed the usual loyal toasts, and the Prince of Wales responded in\r\nthe following terms:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--I am deeply flattered by\r\n    the kind manner in which this toast has been proposed and\r\n    received in this large and distinguished assemblage. I feel it a\r\n    matter of the greatest pleasure, and at the same time the\r\n    greatest pride, to be among you here to-day. It is a matter of\r\n    pride, ladies and gentlemen, to be connected with this\r\n    Principality, and it has afforded me the greatest pleasure to\r\n    accept the invitation of the Chairman and Directors of the\r\n    London and North Western Company to inaugurate this new harbour.\r\n    It is not the first time, as you are aware, that I have had\r\n    occasion to come to Holyhead. Seven years ago I had the pleasure\r\n    of inaugurating your breakwater, which I am glad to see is now\r\n    successfully terminated and is of the greatest possible utility.\r\n    The sunshine we have enjoyed to-day may be taken as a good\r\n    augury for the success of the London and North Western Railway\r\n    Company in their new undertaking. This undertaking has cost them\r\n    a very large sum of money, but it will, I am sure, be of the\r\n    greatest benefit to commerce, and will tend to make the Holyhead\r\n    route still more than it is a connecting link between England\r\n    and Ireland. Before sitting down I have a toast to propose,\r\n    which I feel sure you will drink with the greatest pleasure; it\r\n    is 'The Health of the Chairman, Mr. Moon, and Success and\r\n    Prosperity to the London and North Western Railway Company.' I\r\n    also desire to declare the new harbour open.\"\r\n\r\nBoth on land and water there were many loyal demonstrations; and\r\ngentlemen representing all the leading railway companies, French and\r\nIrish, as well as English and Welsh, were entertained by the Directors\r\nof the London and North Western.\r\n\r\nThe opening sentences of a leading article in the _Times_ on the\r\nfollowing day, form a tribute due to the Prince for his part in the\r\nceremony:--\r\n\r\n\"The representative duties of Royalty in this country are heavier than\r\nthe private functions the hardest-worked Englishman has to perform. Only\r\nthe other day we were recording the part played by the Prince of Wales\r\nin an ecclesiastical pageant in Cornwall. On Wednesday he was\r\nintroducing a foreign Sovereign to the Corporation of London. Straight\r\nfrom that ceremonial he had to take flight across the island to open\r\nformally the new harbour at Holyhead. In these scenes and a hundred like\r\nthem a Prince's functions cannot be discharged satisfactorily unless he\r\nbe at once an impersonation of Royal State and, what is harder still,\r\nhis own individual self. He must act his public character as if he\r\nenjoyed the festival as much as any of the spectators. He must be able\r\nto stamp a national impress upon the solemnity, yet mark its local and\r\nparticular significance. In presenting a King of the Hellenes to the\r\ncitizens at the Guildhall the Prince of Wales had to remember that his\r\nguest and the guest of the City was both a near and dear relative and\r\nthe embodiment of an illustrious cause. In laying the first stone of a\r\ncathedral at Truro he had to be both Duke of Cornwall and the Heir of\r\nEngland. In presiding yesterday at Holyhead he had to recollect the\r\nprovincial associations connected with the title he bears, and not\r\nforget the imperial importance of a work which creates a new link\r\nbetween two great divisions of the United Kingdom. That he achieved his\r\ntask successfully was a matter of course. No apprehension ever touches\r\nthose who are present at a scene of which the Prince of Wales is the\r\ncentre, that he may chance to chill by lack of interest, to choose his\r\nwords of admiration inopportunely, or to praise without sympathy. The\r\nwork he came, as it were, to sanction by national approbation is a grand\r\nengineering undertaking, and is grander yet in its probable moral\r\nconsequences. The Prince of Wales understood and expressed its\r\nsignificance from both aspects.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW COLOURS TO THE ROYAL WELSH FUSILIERS.\r\n\r\n_August 16th, 1880._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Welsh Fusiliers (or Twenty-third Regiment of Foot in the old\r\nArmy Lists) received the more familiar name from having been first\r\nraised in Wales in 1714, and in honour of the Prince of Wales of that\r\nday. Their nationality is further betokened by the Prince of Wales's\r\nplume, with the motto \"Ich Dien,\" which, together with the Rising Sun,\r\nthe Red Dragon, the White Horse, and the Sphinx, they bear on their\r\ncolours. The regiment is one of the oldest and most famous in the Army,\r\nand the proud words, \"Nec aspera terrent,\" which are emblazoned on its\r\nregimental silk, it has amply justified by its gallant conduct from the\r\nBattle of the Boyne, in 1690, to the Indian Mutiny, in 1858, including\r\nEgypt, Corunna, Martinique, Albuera, Badajoz, Salamanca, the Pyrenees,\r\nNivelle, Orthes, Toulouse, Waterloo, Alma, Inkerman, Sebastopol, and\r\nnearly fifty other engagements which are not recorded on its colours.\r\n\r\nIt was peculiarly fitting that the duty of presenting new colours to\r\nthis brave and distinguished Welsh regiment should be undertaken by the\r\nPrince of Wales. This he did on the 16th of August, 1880, coming from\r\nOsborne for the purpose, when the 1st Battalion of the Welsh Fusiliers,\r\nabove nine hundred strong, including officers, was embarking for India\r\nfrom Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nThe colours, exchanged for new ones on that day, had been presented in\r\n1849 by the late Prince Consort, the battalion at the same time\r\nreceiving from the Queen the first of those Royal goats, which have\r\nalways since marched at the head of the regiment. When the gallant\r\n\"Nanny Goats,\" as the Twenty-third are nick-named, first had the\r\nregimental pet is not exactly known, but since 1849 a Royal goat has\r\nbeen received from Windsor whenever a vacancy occurs.\r\n\r\nThe colours replaced by the new ones in 1880 had a history of their own,\r\nand the regiment took pride in them, although in such a tattered\r\ncondition that they could not be unfurled. The Queen's colour was that\r\nwhich was carried by Lieutenant Anstruther, who was killed when planting\r\nit on the Great Redoubt at Sebastopol. Twelve officers and half the rank\r\nand file fell in that terrible rush, but the Royal Welsh had the honour\r\nof first entering the enemy's stronghold. No fewer than seventy-five\r\nbullets passed through the colours, and the pole of one of them was shot\r\nin two, and had to be tied up with a cord. Sergeant O'Connor, though\r\ndangerously wounded, carried the Queen's colours till the end of the\r\nbattle, and was rewarded by a commission in the regiment, receiving the\r\nVictoria Cross at the close of the war. He rose to be Colonel of the 2nd\r\nBattalion, and was present, with his breast covered with well-earned\r\ndecorations, when the Prince of Wales came to present the new colours at\r\nPortsmouth. The colours were afterwards carried through the Indian\r\nMutiny, where Colonel Elgee and several of the officers had the honour\r\nof serving under them. The ragged relics were relegated to the\r\nhonourable obscurity of Wrexham Church.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of removing the old colours and presenting the new was an\r\nimposing spectacle, witnessed by an immense assemblage, and amidst great\r\nenthusiasm. The old colours having been placed in front of the saluting\r\npost, were afterwards sent to the rear, the band playing \"Auld Lang\r\nSyne.\" Then the new colours were presented by the Prince, with whom was\r\nthe Princess of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Prince Edward of\r\nSaxe-Weimar. Having received the colours from the Majors, the Prince\r\npresented them separately to the Lieutenants, and then turning to the\r\nColonel, spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Colonel Elgee, officers, and non-commissioned officers and men\r\n    of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers,--I consider it a very great\r\n    privilege to have been asked to present your regiment with new\r\n    colours on the eve of its departure for India. It occurs to me\r\n    in presenting these colours that they are to replace those which\r\n    were given to you about thirty-one years ago by my lamented\r\n    father, and which through three campaigns your regiment has\r\n    carried with honour and success. You will in a few years\r\n    celebrate your 200th anniversary, and during that time your\r\n    regiment has served in nearly every quarter of the globe, and\r\n    seen as much or more service than any regiment in the Army. You\r\n    have served at Corunna, Salamanca, the Peninsula, Waterloo,\r\n    Alma, Inkerman, Sebastopol, Lucknow, and, coming down to more\r\n    recent times, Ashantee. I feel sure that there will always be\r\n    the same emulation among those who serve in your ranks as there\r\n    has been in the past, and that the good name of your regiment\r\n    will always be maintained as prominently as it is now. You are\r\n    now on the eve of departure for India, and nobody wishes you\r\n    'God-speed' more sincerely than I do. I feel sure that, whatever\r\n    your services may be, they will be such as will bring credit to\r\n    your regiment, and will add additional proofs of the valour for\r\n    which it is so justly celebrated.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Elgee made a suitable and soldierly reply, thus concluding: \"I\r\nam sure that wherever the colours are carried--whether before an enemy\r\nor in the performance of our duties at home in times of peace--the\r\nregiment will always maintain the high reputation it has won. On the eve\r\nof our departure for India, we beg to express our heartiest wishes for\r\nthe health and happiness of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, your\r\nRoyal Highness, the Princess of Wales, and the remainder of the Royal\r\nFamily.\"\r\n\r\nThe line having been reformed, His Royal Highness had the whole of the\r\nofficers drawn up on each side of the drums, and as they saluted and\r\npassed to their posts, each was individually presented to the Prince and\r\nPrincess by the Colonel. A few more movements, and the ranks were\r\nclosed, the line broke into columns to the right, and marched past to\r\nthe jetty, where they embarked on board the _Malabar_. After luncheon,\r\nthe whole party from the Royal yacht, including the Princess Beatrice,\r\nwho had arrived in the _Alberta_ to receive the Empress Eugénie and take\r\nher to Osborne on a visit to the Queen, proceeded on board the\r\n_Malabar_, where they stayed three-quarters of an hour and made a\r\nthorough inspection of the ship, where they were welcomed with much\r\nenthusiasm. When at length the ship drew away into the stream, followed\r\nby the Royal yacht _Osborne_, the band of the Royal Marines ashore\r\nplayed \"The March of the Men of Harlech,\" and \"Cheer, Boys, Cheer,\"\r\nwhile the troops responded by singing \"Auld Lang Syne.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n_May 24th, 1881._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Hospital, which is the oldest of its kind in London, is situated in\r\nWaterloo Bridge Road, in a populous and poor district. It contains now\r\nabout 50 beds. The number of out-patient attendances averages 3000 a\r\nmonth, and upwards of 250 visits each month are paid by the\r\nhouse-surgeon to sick children at their own homes. The ordinary receipts\r\nare about £3000, and the funded property £6500. It is a well-managed and\r\nuseful charity, and just such a one as would gain the good will of the\r\nPrince of Wales, who presided at the festival dinner, in Willis's Rooms,\r\non the Queen's Birthday, May 24th, 1881.\r\n\r\nAfter the customary loyal and patriotic toasts, the Royal Chairman\r\nbriefly but earnestly pleaded the cause of the charity. He said that--\r\n\r\n    The largeness of the gathering on that occasion was evidence of\r\n    the interest taken in this great and important charity. During\r\n    the last few years, he remarked, we had suffered from both\r\n    agricultural and commercial depression, and institutions of a\r\n    charitable kind, especially those which owed their existence and\r\n    maintenance to voluntary contributions, must naturally feel a\r\n    depression, which prevented many persons from coming forward to\r\n    their support; but still he did not despair of the results of\r\n    the appeal which he had to make that evening. This institution\r\n    had now been in existence for seventy-one years. It was situated\r\n    in a very populous and very poor district, its object being the\r\n    cure of sick children and women. He might remark that many of\r\n    his family had taken considerable interest in this hospital. His\r\n    grandfather, the Duke of Kent, presided at the first anniversary\r\n    dinner, and his great-uncle, the Duke of Sussex, took a deep\r\n    interest in it. Only four years ago his sister, the Princess\r\n    Louise, visited the institution, and, being much gratified with\r\n    what she saw, gave her name to one of the wards. Unfortunately,\r\n    the institution was not so flourishing financially as it ought\r\n    to be. The ordinary income was £2000 a year less than was\r\n    required to meet the expenditure. It was also most important\r\n    that the hospital should be enlarged. The freehold of the\r\n    surrounding property had been obtained from the Duchy of\r\n    Cornwall at an expense of £3000. Several years ago that great\r\n    philanthropist, Lord Shaftesbury, presided at a dinner in aid of\r\n    this charity, when a sum of nearly £3000 was raised. If the same\r\n    amount could be made up that evening all who were interested in\r\n    the institution would be deeply gratified. Mentioning that since\r\n    the foundation of the Hospital as many as 400,000 children had\r\n    been relieved, His Royal Highness said that patients were\r\n    received not only from all parts of this country, but also from\r\n    the Continent, and medical and surgical treatment was afforded\r\n    them gratuitously. The report of the Hospital Saturday Fund\r\n    stated that the institution stood among the first for efficiency\r\n    and economy.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding his speech the Prince of Wales proposed the health of\r\nthe Lord Mayor, who is by virtue of his office President of the\r\ninstitution. Mr. Kestin, the Secretary, read a list of donations and\r\nsubscriptions which, including 100 guineas from the chairman, exceeded\r\n£2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT KING'S COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n_July 2nd, 1881._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, accompanied by the Princess, distributed the\r\nprincipal prizes of the year at King's College, London, on the 2nd of\r\nJuly, 1881. The Rev. Canon Barry, D.D., the Principal, received the\r\nRoyal visitors, and at the opening of the proceedings, said: \"it will\r\nalways be a day in the annals of the College to be marked with a white\r\nstone, when the Prince and Princess of Wales had come for the first time\r\namong them, and on the jubilee day of the institution.\" After the\r\ndistribution of the prizes and decorations, the Prince acknowledging a\r\nvote of thanks for his presence, proposed by the Duke of Cambridge, and\r\nseconded by the Bishop of Gloucester, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Principal Barry, Ladies and Gentlemen,--For the very kind\r\n    words in which the illustrious Duke has proposed the vote of\r\n    thanks, the kind way in which it has been seconded by the Bishop\r\n    of Gloucester and Bristol, and the cordial manner in which you\r\n    have all been good enough to receive this vote, I ask you to\r\n    accept my most sincere thanks, and also the thanks of the\r\n    Princess of Wales for the kind way in which her name has been\r\n    alluded to to-day.\r\n\r\n    \"It would have been a gratification to me on any day to come to\r\n    this college and present the prizes to the successful\r\n    competitors, but as this day is your jubilee day, your fiftieth\r\n    anniversary, it makes it still more interesting to me to come\r\n    here to-day and give away the prizes. After all that has fallen\r\n    from the lips of your Principal, and after perusing, though I\r\n    admit somewhat cursorily, the annual report, but little is left\r\n    for me to say; but all those who take an interest in the success\r\n    of this college will have every reason to be satisfied with the\r\n    state of the college, and with the report which I hold in my\r\n    hands. Everything connected with this institution is on a most\r\n    satisfactory and excellent footing.\r\n\r\n    \"In these days, when education is so much thought of, and when\r\n    meetings in every part of the kingdom are continually taking\r\n    place for the purpose of getting still higher standards of\r\n    education, it is naturally difficult for institutions of old\r\n    date to keep up with the times; but I do not think or fear that\r\n    this college will have any reason to fear competition from\r\n    others, as it already stands as one of the second or third great\r\n    educational colleges in the kingdom. The prizes which have been\r\n    given to-day for the different subjects in this list embrace\r\n    nearly every possible subject of education which may be of use\r\n    to those young men who are going out into the world.\r\n\r\n    \"This college justly claims to be one which has done very much\r\n    for the higher education of men; and it affords me, and I know\r\n    it affords also the Princess of Wales, great gratification to\r\n    learn that it will be extended also towards the education of\r\n    women. This year, since the Principal and the Council received a\r\n    memorial signed by various distinguished persons, they have very\r\n    wisely adopted that memorial, by enabling women already to\r\n    receive education by way of listening to lectures from\r\n    distinguished teachers and professors in this college.\r\n\r\n    \"It has been already stated that some of our children have\r\n    received education from some of the professors of this college.\r\n    It is very gratifying to us that such has been the case, and we\r\n    have every hope that they will derive benefit from the\r\n    instruction they have received.\r\n\r\n    \"Before concluding I wish to congratulate those young gentlemen\r\n    to whom I have presented these prizes to-day on having received\r\n    these proofs that the education they have received here has not\r\n    been thrown away. As most of them are about to leave the\r\n    college, I sincerely hope they will allow me to offer them my\r\n    best wishes, and to trust that in their future career they will\r\n    continue to do credit to themselves and those by whom they have\r\n    been educated. I again express the pleasure which both the\r\n    Princess and myself have felt in coming here to-day, and say\r\n    that we most cordially wish continued and lasting prosperity to\r\n    King's College.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL BANQUET AT THE MANSION HOUSE.\r\n\r\n_July 16th, 1881._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor of London entertained the Prince of Wales, President of\r\nthe Colonial Institute, and a large company of representatives of the\r\nColonies, with other distinguished guests, at dinner, at the Mansion\r\nHouse, on July the 16th, 1881. Seldom has there been such an assemblage\r\nin the Capital of the British Empire. Governors, Premiers, and\r\nAdministrators of so many countries were present, that one might almost\r\nwonder how affairs went on in their absence. But rulers as well as\r\nsubjects must have holiday rest, and the facility and rapidity of travel\r\nallow easy access from all parts of the world to \"the mother country.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor (Sir William McArthur, M.P.), after the toast of \"The\r\nQueen,\" said that they were honoured with the presence of an unexpected\r\nbut very distinguished guest, the King of the Sandwich Islands. It was\r\nthe first time that His Majesty had visited Europe, and he naturally\r\nwished to visit the land which first made known to the world the islands\r\nof the Pacific. \"Having once visited the Sandwich Islands,\" said the\r\nLord Mayor, \"I was charmed not only with the beauty of the scenery and\r\nthe fertility of the soil, but with the good order which everywhere\r\nprevailed. His Majesty reigns over a very prosperous and a very happy\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast being duly honoured, the King of the Sandwich Islands\r\nexpressed his high sense of the graciousness of the Queen, the Prince of\r\nWales, and the other Royal and distinguished persons he had met, and\r\nwould carry back to his country the most grateful and pleasant\r\nrecollections of his visit.\r\n\r\nTho Lord Mayor next gave \"The health of the Prince of Wales, the\r\nPrincess of Wales, and the other members of the Royal Family.\" In\r\nresponse to the toast, the Prince arose amidst great cheering, and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Mayor, your Majesty, my Lords and Gentlemen,--For the\r\n    kind and remarkably flattering way in which you, my Lord Mayor,\r\n    have been good enough to propose this toast, and you, my lords\r\n    and gentlemen, for the kind and hearty way in which you have\r\n    received it, I beg to offer you my most sincere thanks. It is a\r\n    peculiar pleasure to me to come to the City, because I have the\r\n    honour of being one of its freemen. But this is, indeed, a very\r\n    special dinner, one of a kind that I do not suppose has ever\r\n    been given before; for we have here this evening representatives\r\n    of probably every Colony in the Empire. We have not only the\r\n    Secretary of the Colonies, but Governors past and present,\r\n    ministers, administrators, and agents are all, I think, to be\r\n    found here this evening. I regret that it has not been possible\r\n    for me to see half or one-third of the colonies which it has\r\n    been the good fortune of my brother the Duke of Edinburgh to\r\n    visit. In his voyages round the world he has had opportunities\r\n    more than once of seeing all our great colonies. Though I have\r\n    not been able personally to see them, or only a small portion of\r\n    them, you may rest assured it does not diminish in any way the\r\n    interest I take in them.\r\n\r\n    \"It is, I am sorry to say, now going on for twenty-one years\r\n    since I visited our large North American colonies. Still, though\r\n    I was very young at the time, the remembrance of that visit is\r\n    as deeply imprinted on my memory now as it was at that time. I\r\n    shall never forget the public receptions which were accorded to\r\n    me in Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward\r\n    Island, and if it were possible for me at any time to repeat\r\n    that visit, I need not tell you, gentlemen, who now represent\r\n    here those great North American colonies, of the great pleasure\r\n    it would give me to do so. It affords me great gratification to\r\n    see an old friend, Sir John Macdonald, the Premier of Canada,\r\n    here this evening.\r\n\r\n    \"It was a most pressing invitation, certainly, that I received\r\n    two years ago to visit the great Australasian Colonies, and\r\n    though at the time I was unable to give an answer, in the\r\n    affirmative or in the negative, still it soon became apparent\r\n    that my many duties here in England would prevent my\r\n    accomplishing what would have been a long, though a most\r\n    interesting voyage. I regret that such has been the case, and\r\n    that I was not able to accept the kind invitation I received to\r\n    visit the Exhibitions at Sydney and at Melbourne. I am glad,\r\n    however, to know that they have proved a great success, as has\r\n    been testified to me only this evening by the noble Duke\r\n    (Manchester) by my side, who has so lately returned. Though, my\r\n    lords and gentlemen, I have, as I have said before, not had the\r\n    opportunity of seeing these great Australasian Colonies, which\r\n    every day and every year are making such immense development,\r\n    still, at the International Exhibitions of London, Paris, and\r\n    Vienna, I had not only an opportunity of seeing their various\r\n    products there exhibited, but I had the pleasure of making the\r\n    personal acquaintance of many colonists--a fact which has been a\r\n    matter of great importance and great benefit to myself.\r\n\r\n    \"It is now thirty years since the first International Exhibition\r\n    took place in London, and then for the first time colonial\r\n    exhibits were shown to the world. Since that time, from the\r\n    Exhibitions which have followed our first great gathering in\r\n    1851, the improvements that have been made are manifest. That in\r\n    itself is a clear proof of the way in which the colonies have\r\n    been exerting themselves to make their vast territories of the\r\n    great importance that they are at the present moment. But\r\n    though, my Lord Mayor, I have not been to Australasia, as you\r\n    have mentioned, I have sent my two sons on a visit there; and it\r\n    has been a matter of great gratification, not only to myself and\r\n    to the Princess, but to the Queen, to hear of the kindly\r\n    reception they have met with everywhere. They are but young, but\r\n    I feel confident that their visit to the Antipodes will do them\r\n    an incalculable amount of good. On their way out they visited a\r\n    colony in which, unfortunately, the condition of affairs was not\r\n    quite as satisfactory as we could wish, and as a consequence\r\n    they did not extend their visits in that part of South Africa\r\n    quite so far inland as might otherwise have been the case. I\r\n    must thank you once more, my Lord Mayor, for the kind way in\r\n    which you have proposed this toast.\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you, in the name of the Princess and the other members\r\n    of the Royal Family, for the kind reception their names have met\r\n    with from all here to-night, and I beg again to assure you most\r\n    cordially and heartily of the great pleasure it has given me to\r\n    be present here among so many distinguished colonists and\r\n    gentlemen connected with the colonies, and to have had an\r\n    opportunity of meeting your distinguished guest, the King of the\r\n    Sandwich Islands. If your lordship's visit to his dominions\r\n    remains impressed on your mind, I think your lordship's kindly\r\n    reception of His Majesty here to-night is not likely soon to be\r\n    forgotten by him.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Manchester, in responding to the toast of \"The House of\r\nLords,\" said that he took much less part in the proceedings of that\r\naugust body than many of its members. He had, however, lately visited\r\nsome of our colonies--and that was, perhaps, the reason why he was\r\ncalled upon to respond to that toast. Having given some remarkable\r\nstatistics of progress in Australia, he said, \"It was calculated that\r\nAustralians and New Zealanders, per head, man, woman, and child,\r\nconsumed £8 10s.-worth of British goods, while France only rated at 7s.\r\n8d. per head, and the United States at 7s. per head. These were facts\r\nshowing that, if for no other reason, there were very forcible financial\r\nreasons why we should consolidate, encourage, and promote in every way\r\nthe prosperity of the British Colonies.\"\r\n\r\nThe Speaker, in returning thanks on behalf of the House of Commons, said\r\nhe was one of those who had a great faith in the future of the English\r\npeople throughout the world. Wherever Englishmen set their foot they\r\ngrew and prospered; they had learnt the habit of self-government, and\r\nwere well acquainted with the forms of government, and they carried with\r\nthem English customs, English habits, English institutions. Thus we had\r\na great Colonial Empire firmly compacted together of colonists from the\r\nold country, all loyal subjects of the Crown. He trusted and believed\r\nthat that state of things would long continue, and he hoped that the\r\nbonds between those colonies and the mother country would become closer\r\nand closer from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor then proposed the toast of the evening, \"The British\r\nColonies,\" to which the Earl of Kimberley replied, concluding with these\r\nwords: \"This is a representative assembly, and one of the most\r\nremarkable ever gathered together in this Metropolis. I congratulate\r\nyou, my Lord Mayor, on the happy notion of bringing together this\r\nassembly, which must have an equally happy effect in promoting good\r\nfeeling both here and in the Colonies, inasmuch as it is a type of the\r\nunion which ought to bind us together.\"\r\n\r\n    The Prince of Wales then proposed the Lord Mayor's health in a\r\n    brief speech, in the course of which he said that it must be\r\n    especially gratifying to his lordship to preside at such a\r\n    dinner, seeing that he was well acquainted with the colonies,\r\n    being a colonial merchant of high repute, and having visited, if\r\n    not all, at any rate most of our great colonies.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor briefly acknowledged the compliment, and said this\r\nmeeting was one of the most gratifying incidents of his year of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY AND GUILDS OF LONDON INSTITUTE.\r\n\r\n_July 18th, 1881._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf many movements originated by the late Prince Consort, and carried\r\nforward by the Prince of Wales, the advancement of technical education\r\nis one of the highest national importance. Without going into past\r\nhistory, it is sufficient to say that of late years some of the Guilds\r\nof the City of London have been awakened to a sense of their duties in\r\ntraining artisans, for which purpose they were at first mainly founded.\r\nThe Corporation of London has aided the movement, but in a more limited\r\nway. At first the efforts were directed to the encouragement of\r\ntechnical education in existing schools and colleges by pecuniary\r\ngrants. But subsequently the Institute has been enabled to establish\r\nschools of its own, and to assist in development of technical\r\ninstruction, not in London only, but in many large provincial towns.\r\n\r\nThe Institute had been incorporated in 1880, and in May of that year the\r\nlate Duke of Albany laid the foundation stone of the Finsbury Technical\r\nCollege, the first building in the Metropolis exclusively devoted to\r\nthis practical training. In Lambeth and other districts similar schools\r\nhave been instituted; but it was thought advisable to found a Central\r\nInstitute for systematic teaching the practical applications of science\r\nand art to the trades and industries of the country. Hitherto the\r\ntraining of artisans has been mainly dependent on the customs of\r\napprenticeship in the various handicrafts; upwards of twenty of the City\r\nCompanies, including nine out of the twelve greater Guilds, had\r\nsubscribed largely, and had entered the associated Institute, when the\r\nPrince of Wales was invited to become the President. By the influence of\r\nthe Prince, as President of the Royal Commissioners of 1851, a site for\r\nthe proposed central College was granted at a nominal rent, on the\r\nestate at South Kensington. To lay the foundation stone of this\r\nbuilding, the Prince, accompanied by the Princess of Wales, came on the\r\n18th of July, 1881.\r\n\r\nAn address having been delivered by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Selborne,\r\nChairman of the Committee of the Institute, the Prince of Wales\r\ndelivered the following speech, which more clearly presents the whole\r\nsubject, and brings out its national importance:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Chancellor, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--I thank\r\n    you for your address, and beg leave to assure you that it gives\r\n    me much satisfaction to attend here to-day to lay the foundation\r\n    stone of an institution which gives such forcible expression to\r\n    one of the most important needs in the education of persons who\r\n    are destined to take part in the productive history of this\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    \"Hitherto English teaching has chiefly relied on training the\r\n    intellectual faculties, so as to adapt men to apply their\r\n    intelligence in any occupation of life to which they may be\r\n    called; and this general discipline of the mind has on the whole\r\n    been found sufficient until recent times; but during the last\r\n    thirty years the competition of other nations, even in\r\n    manufactures which once were exclusively carried on in this\r\n    kingdom, has been very severe. The great progress that has been\r\n    made in the means of locomotion as well as in the application of\r\n    steam for the purposes of life has distributed the raw materials\r\n    of industry all over the world, and has economized time and\r\n    labour in their conversion to objects of utility. Other nations\r\n    which did not possess in such abundance as Great Britain coal,\r\n    the source of power, and iron, the essence of strength,\r\n    compensated for the want of raw material by the technical\r\n    education of their industrial classes, and this country has,\r\n    therefore, seen manufactures springing up everywhere, guided by\r\n    the trained intelligence thus created. Both in Europe and in\r\n    America technical colleges for teaching, not the practice, but\r\n    the principles of science and art involved in particular\r\n    industries, had been organized in all the leading centres of\r\n    industry.\r\n\r\n    \"England is now thoroughly aware of the necessity for\r\n    supplementing her educational institutions by colleges of a like\r\n    nature. Most of our great manufacturing towns have either\r\n    started or have already erected their colleges of science and\r\n    art. In only a few instances, however, have they become\r\n    developed into schools for systematic technical instruction.\r\n    This building, which is to be erected by the City and Guilds of\r\n    London, will be of considerable benefit to the whole kingdom,\r\n    not only as an example of the institute devoting itself to\r\n    technical training, but as a focus likewise for uniting the\r\n    different technical schools in the Metropolis already in\r\n    existence, and a central establishment also to which promising\r\n    students from the provinces may, by the aid of scholarships, he\r\n    brought to benefit by the superior instruction which London can\r\n    command. While studying at your institution, they will have the\r\n    further advantages that the treasures of the South Kensington\r\n    Museum and the numerous collections in the City may bring to\r\n    bear on the artistic and scientific education of future\r\n    manufacturers.\r\n\r\n    \"Let me remind you that the realization of this idea was one of\r\n    the most cherished objects which my lamented father had in view.\r\n    After the Exhibition of 1851, he recognized the need of\r\n    technical education in the future, and he foresaw how difficult\r\n    it would be in London to find space for such museums and\r\n    colleges as those which now surround the spot on which we stand.\r\n    It is, therefore, to me a peculiar pleasure that the\r\n    Commissioners of the Exhibition, of which I am the President,\r\n    have been able to contribute to your present important\r\n    undertaking, by giving to you the ground upon which the present\r\n    college is to be erected, with a sufficient reserve of land to\r\n    insure its future development.\r\n\r\n    \"Allow me, in conclusion, to express the great satisfaction\r\n    which I experience in seeing the ancient guilds of the City of\r\n    London so warmly co-operating in the advancement of technical\r\n    instruction. I am aware that several of them have for some time\r\n    past in various ways separately encouraged the study of science\r\n    and art in the Metropolis, as well as in the provinces; and it\r\n    is a noble effort on their part when they join together to\r\n    establish a united institute with the view of making still\r\n    greater and more systematic endeavours for the promotion of this\r\n    branch of special education. By consenting at your request to\r\n    become the President of this Institute I hope it may be in my\r\n    power to benefit the good work, and that our joint exertions,\r\n    aided, I trust, by the continued liberality of the City and\r\n    Guilds of London, may prove to be an example to the rest of the\r\n    country to train the intelligence of industrial communities, so\r\n    that, with the increasing competition of the world, England may\r\n    retain her proud pre-eminence as a manufacturing nation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this address, the ceremony of laying the foundation stone was\r\ncompleted. A medal to commemorate the event had previously been struck\r\nat the Royal Mint.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the Times of October 20th, 1888, that \"in the last ten\r\nyears several of the Companies, in conjunction with the City\r\nCorporation, have together given something like a quarter of a million\r\nto the City Guilds of London Institute--the amount including gifts of\r\n£46,000 from the Goldsmiths, of £43,000 from the Drapers, of £37,000\r\nfrom the Clothworkers, of £34,000 from the Fishmongers, of £22,000 from\r\nthe Mercers, of £10,000 from the Grocers, and of £11,000 from the City\r\nCorporation. Besides this, to mention the more salient examples, the\r\nDrapers have given some £60,000 to the People's Palace, the Goldsmiths\r\nhave promised an annuity of £2,500, equivalent to a capital sum of\r\n£85,000, to the New Cross Technical Institute, the Mercers propose to\r\ndevote £60,000 to the establishment of an agricultural college in\r\nWiltshire, and the Shipwrights' Company is taking the lead in a movement\r\nfor the formation of a college of shipbuilding in connection with a\r\nTechnical Institute at the East-end.\"\r\n\r\nBesides all this, the people of South London are preparing to establish\r\nthree Technical Institutes, with the help of the Charity Commissioners;\r\nand, if possible, to secure the Albert Palace for a Battersea Institute.\r\nA similar movement has begun in North London. These local Technical\r\nSchools are independent of the City Guilds of London Institute at\r\nKensington, but the impulse was given by its establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n_August 3rd, 1881._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventh meeting of the International Medical Congress was formally\r\nopened by the Prince of Wales, on the 3rd of August, 1881. It was the\r\nfirst time the Congress had been held in England. The great room of St.\r\nJames's Hall was nearly filled, 3000 members being present. No lady\r\npractitioners were admitted, although at least 25 women, practising\r\nmedicine, were then on the English Medical Register, and a protest\r\nagainst the decision of the Council had been signed by 43 duly qualified\r\nmedical women. At previous meetings of the Congress in foreign countries\r\nwomen were not excluded.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, on his arrival, was received by Sir W. Jenner, Sir\r\nWilliam Gull, Sir James Paget, Sir J. Risdon Bennett, and other members\r\nof the Committee. The Honorary Secretary having read the report of the\r\nExecutive Committee, the Prince of Wales, who was accompanied by the\r\nCrown Prince of Prussia, the late Emperor \"Frederick the Noble,\" rose\r\nand said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Imperial Highness and Gentlemen,--I gladly complied with\r\n    the request that I should be patron of the International Medical\r\n    Congress of 1881, and among many reasons for so doing was my\r\n    conviction that few things can tend more to the welfare of\r\n    mankind than that educated men of all nations should from time\r\n    to time meet together for the promotion of the branches of\r\n    knowledge to which they devote themselves. The intercourse and\r\n    the mutual esteem of nations have often been advanced by great\r\n    international exhibitions, and I look back with pleasure to\r\n    those with which I have been connected; but when conferences are\r\n    held among those who in all parts of the world apply themselves\r\n    to the study of science, even greater international benefits\r\n    may, I think, be confidently anticipated, more especially in the\r\n    study of medicine and surgery, for in these the effects of\r\n    climate and of national habits must give to the practitioners of\r\n    each nation opportunities, not only of acquiring knowledge, but\r\n    of imparting knowledge to those of their _confrères_ whom they\r\n    meet in Congress.\r\n\r\n    \"I venture to think, gentlemen, that the Executive Committee\r\n    have acted wisely in instituting sections for the discussion of\r\n    a very wide range of subjects, including not only the sciences\r\n    on which medical knowledge is founded, but many of its most\r\n    practical applications, and I am very happy to see that so great\r\n    scope will be granted for the discussion of important questions\r\n    relating to the public health, to the cure of the sick in\r\n    hospitals and in the houses of the poor, and to the welfare of\r\n    the Army and Navy. The devotion with which many members of the\r\n    medical profession readily share the dangers of climate and the\r\n    fatigues and dangers of war, and the many risks which must be\r\n    encountered in the study of means, not only for the remedy, but\r\n    for the prevention of disease, deserves the warmest\r\n    acknowledgment from the public.\r\n\r\n    \"I have great satisfaction in believing, in seeing this crowded\r\n    hall, that I may already regard the Congress as successful in\r\n    having attracted a number never hitherto equalled of medical men\r\n    from all parts of this kingdom, as well as from every country in\r\n    Europe, from the United States, and from other parts of the\r\n    world. The list of officers of the Congress, including as it\r\n    does the names of those distinguished in every branch of\r\n    medical science, shows how heartily the proposal to hold the\r\n    meeting in London has been received. I think it speaks well for\r\n    the good feeling of the profession that there should have been\r\n    so warm a response to the invitations. How cordially the\r\n    proposal has been received may be seen not only in the large\r\n    number of visitors, but in the fact that they include a large\r\n    proportion of those who enjoy a high reputation not only in\r\n    their own countries, but throughout the world. I sincerely\r\n    congratulate the reception committee on this good promise of\r\n    complete success, and I trust that at the close of the Congress\r\n    they will feel rewarded for the labour they have bestowed upon\r\n    it. The report which the secretary-general, Mr. MacCormack, has\r\n    read will have explained how great have been his labours. He\r\n    will hereafter he well repaid, and I am sure Mr. MacCormack is\r\n    sensible that he will be recompensed even for his great\r\n    exertions by the assurance that the progress of the important\r\n    science of medicine has been materially promoted, for any\r\n    addition to the knowledge of medicine must always be followed by\r\n    an increase in the happiness of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThere was general cheering at the close of the speech, and Sir James\r\nPaget, as President of the Congress, then read the inaugural address;\r\nafter which the meeting resolved itself into sections for special\r\nsubjects. Professor Virchow, of Berlin, delivered an address in German\r\nat one of the sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL TO DEAN STANLEY.\r\n\r\n_December 13th, 1881._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ancient Chapter-house, Westminster Abbey, a meeting was held on\r\nthe 13th of December, 1881, for promoting a scheme for raising a fitting\r\nmemorial to the lamented Dean Stanley. The Very Rev. Dr. Bradley, the\r\nnew Dean, presided, and was supported by the Prince of Wales, the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, the Marquis of Salisbury, Earl Granville, the\r\nDuke of Westminster, and many eminent persons in Church and State. There\r\nwere also some ladies, and the representatives of Working Men's Clubs\r\nand Institutes, the purpose being to honour the memory of Dean Stanley,\r\nnot merely as a high ecclesiastic, but as the helper of many good and\r\nbeneficent objects in social life. The proposed tribute was to take the\r\nform first of a monumental memorial in the Abbey to the Dean, and also\r\nto his wife, Lady Augusta Stanley, and to establish a Home for Training\r\nNurses at Westminster, an object in which Lady Augusta had taken deep\r\ninterest. The present meeting, however, was only to set on foot the\r\nmovement, and the first resolution was: \"That the genius, the character,\r\nand the public services of the late Dean of Westminster eminently\r\nentitle him to a national memorial.\" This was moved by the Prince of\r\nWales, who said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Dean, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--In proposing the first\r\n    resolution, which has been committed to my care, I desire to\r\n    express the very sincere pleasure, though I must call it the sad\r\n    pleasure, which I feel in being asked to move this resolution. I\r\n    do so with feelings of sorrow, owing to the long friendship and\r\n    acquaintance which I had with the late Dean of Westminster; and\r\n    yet with pleasure, as I have the satisfaction of proposing to\r\n    you a national memorial to which I am convinced the late Dean\r\n    was so thoroughly entitled. The loss which the death of that\r\n    eminent man has caused to this, and, I may say also, to other\r\n    countries, is indeed great. That loss was deeply felt by my\r\n    beloved mother the Queen, who bore for the late Dean the\r\n    greatest possible friendship and affection, and also by all the\r\n    members of her family.\r\n\r\n    \"If I may be allowed to speak about myself, I had the great\r\n    advantage of knowing most intimately Arthur Stanley for a period\r\n    of twenty-two years. Not only had I the advantage of being his\r\n    pupil during my residence at the University of Oxford, but I was\r\n    also his fellow-traveller in the East when we visited Egypt and\r\n    the Holy Land together; and I am not likely to forget the charm\r\n    of his companionship and all the knowledge that he imparted to\r\n    me during that tour. The many virtues and many great qualities\r\n    of the Dean are so well known to all of you, and are so well\r\n    appreciated throughout the length and breadth of the land, that\r\n    it is almost superfluous in me, and would be almost out of\r\n    taste, were I now to go through the long list of all that he has\r\n    done from the day in which his name came into prominence. Still,\r\n    as the churchman, as the scholar, as the man of letters, as the\r\n    philanthropist, and, above all, as the true friend, his name\r\n    must always go down to posterity as a great and good man, and as\r\n    one who will have made his mark on the chapter of his country's\r\n    history. To all classes he felt alike--to rich and poor, to\r\n    high and low--he was, I may say, the friend of all; and it is\r\n    most gratifying on this occasion to see here present the\r\n    representatives of all classes of the community, and especially\r\n    of the great labouring class to whom he was so devoted, and who,\r\n    I think, owe him so much.\r\n\r\n    \"It is also deeply gratifying, I am sure, to the Dean and those\r\n    who take a deep interest in this meeting that we have the\r\n    advantage of the presence to-day of the Minister of the United\r\n    States. As I was saying, not only was the late Dean appreciated\r\n    and looked up to in this country and in Europe, but also by that\r\n    kindred country across the Atlantic to which he so lately paid a\r\n    visit, and where we know that he received so much kindness and\r\n    hospitality. I heard from his own lips on his return from\r\n    America the expression of the great gratification he derived\r\n    from his visit, and of the hope--of what, alas! was not to\r\n    be--that he might on some future occasion be able to repeat it.\r\n\r\n    \"There is much more that I should wish to say in regard to one\r\n    whom I so deeply deplore, and to whom I bore so great an\r\n    affection. But I am sure it is not the object of this meeting to\r\n    make long speeches, and as many speakers have to follow me, I\r\n    will only again express the gratification I feel in being here\r\n    to propose the resolution which I now have the honour of\r\n    bringing before you.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution was seconded by Earl Granville. The Hon. J. Russell\r\nLowell bore testimony to the honour in which the memory of Dean Stanley\r\nwas held in America, and said he felt sure that many of his countrymen\r\nwould be delighted, as some already had done, to share the privilege of\r\nhelping this memorial.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Tait) moved the next resolution, as to\r\nthe placing of the recumbent statue in the Abbey, and also completing\r\nthe windows in the Chapter-house, in accordance with plans proposed and\r\npartly executed by the Dean. After speeches by the Marquis of Salisbury,\r\nMr. S. Morley. M.P., the Marquis of Lorne, and Lord Chief Justice\r\nColeridge, Mr. Gardiner, representing the Working Men's Club and\r\nInstitute Union, spoke of the constant efforts of the late Dean to help\r\nand elevate the classes who lived by manual labour. He was President of\r\ntheir Union, and he was honoured by the working men of Westminster and\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIFLE VOLUNTEERS.\r\n\r\n_March 1st, 1882._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 21st anniversary dinner of the Civil Service Volunteers, on the 1st\r\nof March, 1882, at Willis's Rooms, was presided over by the Prince of\r\nWales, honorary Colonel of the Corps. In replying to the toast of his\r\nhealth, proposed by the Duke of Manchester, the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen and Brother Volunteers,--For the kind\r\n    manner in which the Duke of Manchester has proposed this toast,\r\n    and for the cordial welcome given to it by you, gentlemen and\r\n    brother Volunteers, allow me to return you my most sincere\r\n    thanks. I can assure you that it affords me great satisfaction\r\n    to preside here to-night on what I may call the twenty-second\r\n    anniversary of the existence of this regiment. The twenty-first\r\n    anniversary of the Rifle Volunteers was celebrated last year,\r\n    and it will, I am sure, not be forgotten through the length and\r\n    breadth of the land that the Queen reviewed the English\r\n    Volunteers in Windsor Park in the summer, and the Scotch\r\n    Volunteers afterwards at Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n    \"I remember, gentlemen, as though it were only yesterday, when I\r\n    was an undergraduate at the University of Oxford in 1859, the\r\n    commencement of the Volunteer movement. I remember the interest\r\n    which all the townspeople of Oxford took in that movement, and\r\n    also the interest it excited among the undergraduates. I confess\r\n    I thought at that time, and many others shared my opinion, that\r\n    to a certain extent the commencement of that movement was an\r\n    inclination on the part of the citizens of our country to play\r\n    at soldiers. Many thought that the movement would not last.\r\n    However, I am glad to find, as you all will have been equally\r\n    glad to find, that we were entirely mistaken in that opinion.\r\n    Twenty-two years ago, when, I may say, the movement had begun to\r\n    ripen, I am not wrong, I think, in stating that the number of\r\n    Volunteers was very nearly 100,000 men. The force has since gone\r\n    through certain vicissitudes, but I think I may say that at the\r\n    present moment it never was in a more flourishing condition, and\r\n    it now numbers not far short of 200,000 men. Most sincerely do\r\n    I hope that the occasion may not arise when their services might\r\n    be required for the defence of their country, but I feel\r\n    convinced that, should that occasion ever arise, the Rifle\r\n    Volunteers of the United Kingdom will go to the front and stand\r\n    to their guns in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\n    \"One great inducement to join the force has been, I think, the\r\n    Wimbledon camp and rifle shooting, and I feel convinced that in\r\n    no country are there better rifle shots than in this, and few\r\n    better than in the Volunteer force. No doubt a great stimulus\r\n    has been given to that force by their being called on to take\r\n    part in manoeuvres, reviews, and sham fights, and of late\r\n    years from their being frequently brigaded with regular troops.\r\n    I am sure there is nothing they like better, and I am sure that\r\n    for the Regular Army, as well as for the Militia, it is most\r\n    desirable this should continue.\r\n\r\n    \"With regard to this regiment with which my name has been now\r\n    associated for twenty-two years, I can only say that from all\r\n    the accounts I have heard it is in a high state of efficiency.\r\n    Since the time of their formation in 1860, 2177 men have passed\r\n    through their ranks, and last year the regiment had a strength\r\n    of 518 men. Nearly all their officers, I believe, have passed\r\n    through the school, and attained the distinction of the letter P\r\n    in the Army List--a distinction of which I know they are justly\r\n    proud. I had an opportunity of reviewing them in 1863 in London,\r\n    and again at Wimbledon in 1870; I saw them at the Review at\r\n    Windsor last year, and I sincerely hope, if it may not be\r\n    inconvenient to those members of the corps who have so many\r\n    avocations, to see them before many weeks are over at the Review\r\n    at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen, let me thank you also for the kind way in which you\r\n    have received the name of the Princess of Wales and the names of\r\n    my brothers and my sons. I am happy to be able to announce to\r\n    you that I received a telegram just before dinner informing me\r\n    of the arrival of the _Bacchante_ at Suez. My sons are now,\r\n    therefore, rapidly approaching the termination of their cruise,\r\n    which has been round the world. I thank you once more for your\r\n    kind reception of me to-night, and it affords me the greatest\r\n    pleasure now to propose the toast of 'Prosperity to the Civil\r\n    Service Rifle Volunteers,' coupled with the name of your\r\n    Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Bury. I know that in his\r\n    presence it would be disagreeable to him if I were to mete out\r\n    any praise which I feel is his due, but I know how much he has\r\n    at heart the prosperity and the efficiency of his regiment, and,\r\n    being now the oldest serving Lieutenant-Colonel in the Volunteer\r\n    force, that you would all deeply regret the day when he should\r\n    leave you. I call upon you, and upon the distinguished guests\r\n    here to-night, to drink prosperity to the regiment, and couple\r\n    the toast with the name of Lord Bury.\"\r\n\r\nViscount Bury, in responding to the toast, said that in looking at the\r\nfirst list of the officers of the regiment, he found only three names of\r\nthose now in active service, those of His Royal Highness, of himself,\r\nand Major Mills. About 350 members of the corps sat down to dinner on\r\nthis, its 21st anniversary. The Duke of Portland, Lord Elcho, now the\r\nEarl of Wemyss, Colonel Loyd-Lindsay, Colonel Grenfell, Governor of the\r\nBank of England, Colonel Du Plat Taylor, and many veterans of the Force,\r\nwere present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH GRAVES IN THE CRIMEA.\r\n\r\n_March 10th, 1883._\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention had from time to time been directed, by reports of travellers\r\nand others, to the neglected state of the burial-places in the Crimea,\r\nand the ruinous condition of monumental memorials over the graves. An\r\nallowance of £90 a year had been made by the Government for maintaining\r\nthe different cemeteries, but this was utterly insufficient for the\r\npurpose. The Consul-General at Odessa had recently reported that there\r\nwere at least eleven graveyards or cemeteries scattered between\r\nBalaclava and Sebastopol, and there were many others in different places\r\nwhere the dead had been laid. The scandal of neglect was so great that\r\nthe Duke of Cambridge called a meeting at the United Service\r\nInstitution, Whitehall, to consider what ought to be done. A large\r\nnumber of distinguished men, including many of those who had passed\r\nthrough the Crimean War, responded to the invitation, and letters were\r\nreceived from others throughout the country who were unable to be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge made a clear statement of the condition of\r\naffairs, and mentioned various suggestions for putting a stop to the\r\ndesecration of the burial-places, and for preserving the memorials from\r\nfurther injury. The Prince of Wales had come to the meeting, and as he\r\nhad seen the places referred to, during his Eastern travels, he was\r\nasked by the Chairman to move the first resolution, which was to the\r\neffect that immediate steps should be taken to remedy the existing state\r\nof the Crimean graves.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, who was warmly received, rose, and said:\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highness, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I was not aware\r\n    until I arrived in this room that I should be called upon to\r\n    move the first resolution. But I need hardly tell you the great\r\n    interest the subject we are discussing here to-day has for me,\r\n    and the great pleasure it gives me to propose the following\r\n    resolution:--'That the present condition of the British\r\n    cemeteries in the Crimea is not creditable to this country, and\r\n    that endeavours should be made to raise the necessary funds to\r\n    have them restored, and to preserve them from further\r\n    desecration.' In 1869 I had occasion to visit the Crimea, and to\r\n    go over all those spots so familiar to most of the gentlemen I\r\n    see opposite me, who took a part in the campaign. And it was a\r\n    matter of particular interest to me to visit those different\r\n    spots where our brave soldiers were buried. I confess that it\r\n    was with deep regret that I saw the manner in which the tombs\r\n    were kept. The condition of the graves was not creditable to us,\r\n    and not creditable to a great country like ours, for I am sure\r\n    we are the very first to do honour to the dead who fought in the\r\n    name of their country.\r\n\r\n    \"It struck me at the time that one of the great faults lay in\r\n    there being so many different cemeteries. The French had a much\r\n    simpler and a better system--that which they call the\r\n    _ossuaire_. I was told at the time that to the feelings of\r\n    Englishmen--on religious, and possibly, I may also say, on\r\n    sentimental grounds--it was repugnant to disturb the remains of\r\n    those who were interred in the Crimea as was done by the French,\r\n    and that to collect them and put them into one large building\r\n    was not what was consonant with our feelings generally. But I\r\n    cannot help thinking, as considerable time has elapsed since our\r\n    comrades fell, and also as we are, in every sense of the word, a\r\n    thoroughly practical nation--I feel myself strongly, although I\r\n    cannot say how far that feeling may be shared by the meeting\r\n    to-day--that it would be far better, and in the long run far\r\n    cheaper, if we were to build a kind of mausoleum, collecting the\r\n    remains of our comrades who fell in the Crimean War, and\r\n    putting them into such a mausoleum. It was really sad to see the\r\n    neglected condition of the tombs. There was one especially with\r\n    which I was struck--that of Sir Robert Newman, who was in the\r\n    Grenadier Guards, and fell in the Battle of Inkerman. His tomb\r\n    was a most elaborate and expensive one, and was built with a\r\n    dark stone, a kind of porphyry. This was broken almost entirely\r\n    to pieces. Upon inquiry of some Russian authorities who\r\n    accompanied me on that occasion, I discovered a curious fact.\r\n    The idea was not merely that of disturbing and breaking open the\r\n    tombs; but, as most of you are aware, the Crim Tartars--who are\r\n    Mohammedans by religion--had an idea that treasures were to be\r\n    found in the tombs. Therefore, the disturbing of them was not\r\n    merely for the sake of disturbing the dead, but with the hope of\r\n    finding some treasures there. It is needless to say that their\r\n    investigations were not satisfied in that respect.\r\n\r\n    \"Of course, gentlemen, with regard to the pecuniary part of the\r\n    question, it is not for me to go into that; but I hope that, as\r\n    so many distinguished military and naval men are present, they\r\n    cannot but have a strong feeling with me that it will ever be a\r\n    living disgrace to us unless we adopt some means to-day by which\r\n    the tombs of our comrades who fell in the Crimea are kept in a\r\n    proper state of preservation. I have merely suggested the idea\r\n    of an _ossuaire_, because it seems to me the simplest form to\r\n    adopt. But it would involve, what many object to, disturbing the\r\n    remains of some who fell. I only hope that before the meeting\r\n    separates to-day we may have arrived at some satisfactory\r\n    conclusion that the graves of our comrades shall in some way be\r\n    respected and maintained in a manner creditable to ourselves and\r\n    to our country. Therefore, it is with the greatest pleasure that\r\n    I move the first resolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution was seconded by General Sir W. Codrington, who said that\r\nthe Russian Government had given additional land at Cathcart's Hill; and\r\nthat the grave-stones and other memorials should be removed there. He\r\ndid not think there should be any removal of the remains of the dead.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales again rose, and said--\r\n\r\n    \"I wish to add that when I went over the different places of\r\n    interest in the Crimea, and inspected all our burial-places, I\r\n    was accompanied by one of the most courteous gentlemen, General\r\n    Kotzebue, the Governor-General of Odessa; and I need only say\r\n    that, as far as the Russian Government represented by him was\r\n    concerned, everything was done to keep the graves from\r\n    desecration. But he told me that, unfortunately, they were\r\n    powerless to prevent it; and it was his opinion, and he strongly\r\n    advised me, that the only way in which to prevent a repetition\r\n    of a desecration of the tombs would be, as I mentioned before,\r\n    to collect the remains and place them in a mausoleum--in the\r\n    same way, in fact, as the French had done. I wish also to say\r\n    that, on my return in the summer from my visit to the Crimea, I\r\n    brought the whole matter most strongly before the late Lord\r\n    Clarendon, who was then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\"\r\n\r\nAfter conversation and remarks by Admiral Sir H. Keppel, General Sir L.\r\nA. Simmons, Lord Wolseley, and others, resolutions were carried for the\r\nconcentration of the memorials in one central place, without removing\r\nthe remains of the dead; and for applying to the Government and to the\r\nnation for larger funds to pay additional guardians of the cemeteries.\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge was warmly commended for having called the\r\nmeeting, which was justified by the large attendance, and the Prince of\r\nWales for his advocacy of the object in view. Tho interest of their\r\nRoyal Highnesses was practically attested by the gift of £50 from the\r\nPrince of Wales and £25 from the Duke of Cambridge toward the necessary\r\nfunds. It was stated in the course of the proceedings that the French\r\nGovernment granted yearly more than double what the British Government\r\ndid, for protecting the Crimean graves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FISHERIES EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n_1883._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the Official Catalogue of the International Fisheries\r\nExhibition, the compiler, Mr. Trendell, gives an interesting account of\r\nthe origin and gradual development of that successful undertaking. It\r\nwas not till some years after the great Exhibition of 1851 that\r\nattention was given to this special department of industry and commerce.\r\nAt Boulogne, Havre, and other maritime places, there were local\r\nexpositions; but the first international exhibition on a large scale was\r\nthat of Berlin in 1880. Norwich was the first town in England to follow\r\nthe Continental example. The local character of the undertaking soon\r\nexpanded into a national enterprise, the Corporation of London and the\r\nFishmongers' Company lending their influence. Chiefly through the agency\r\nof Mr. Birkbeck, one of the Norfolk County members, the official\r\nsanction of the Government was obtained, with permission to grant medals\r\nand diplomas of merit, as in other national exhibitions. The Prince of\r\nWales took a lively interest in the success of this Norwich project, and\r\nhe secured the co-operation of Mr. Birkbeck for holding an International\r\nExhibition in London.\r\n\r\nIn July 1881 a meeting was held at the Hall of the Fishmongers' Company,\r\nwhen a formal resolution was passed for carrying out the proposal, and a\r\nCommittee formed for arranging the general plan of the Exhibition. In\r\nFebruary 1882 a second meeting was held at Willis's Rooms, when the Duke\r\nof Richmond read the report of the proceedings of the Committee formed\r\nin the previous year. The sanction of the Queen was obtained as Patron,\r\nand the Prince of Wales as President, the Duke of Edinburgh and the\r\nother Royal Dukes being named Vice-Presidents, with the Duke of Richmond\r\nas Chairman of the General Committee. The sentiments and motives of the\r\npromoters of the undertaking were well expressed in words spoken by the\r\nPrince of Wales at the inaugural banquet at Norwich. He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is particularly gratifying to see that at last an interest\r\n    is being taken not only in our fisheries, but in our fishermen,\r\n    whose lives are so frequently exposed to risk through the\r\n    severity of weather and the dangerous character of the Eastern\r\n    coast. Among a very interesting display of specimens, I\r\n    especially observed the apparatus for saving life, and a variety\r\n    of models of lifeboats, which cannot fail to bring before the\r\n    public generally their duty in regard to the protection of the\r\n    fishing interests of our country. Whilst thinking over the\r\n    probable results that may attend this Exhibition, I could not\r\n    fail to reflect upon the labour it has cost more minds than one;\r\n    and I do trust, having regard to the importance of our national\r\n    fishing interest, and the value of our fishermen's lives, that a\r\n    sort of National Society may be instituted which will maintain\r\n    those who are unfortunately in want, and help to assuage the\r\n    grief and misery of the widows and orphans of those who perish\r\n    at sea. I believe it is only necessary to throw out the hint to\r\n    see established in this country a National Fishermen's Aid\r\n    Society, which shall command the support not only of those\r\n    living upon the line of our fishing coast here, but of all\r\n    concerned in fishery throughout our dominions.\"\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that at the time of the Norwich Exhibition, and much\r\nmore after the greater show at South Kensington, the Prince of Wales\r\nhad in view the welfare of the fishing folk as well as the benefit of\r\nthe fisheries. What is an exhibition--with its display of exhibits, its\r\nprizes, awards, conferences, and its whole visible organisation--compared\r\nwith the safety of our fishermen's lives, and the improvement of their\r\nhomes? For some departments of this beneficent work there are special\r\nagencies at work--such as the Lifeboat Association, the Deep-Sea\r\nMission, Sailors' Homes, and Seamen's Hospitals--but the idea of the\r\nPrince was that a great central society, analogous to the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society for the cultivation of the soil, might be\r\nestablished, attending to all matters bearing on the social and moral,\r\nas well as the material, benefits of the fishing population of these\r\nislands. It is said that the Government has resolved tardily to have a\r\nDepartment of Agriculture; it is equally needful to have a Department\r\nfor all matters connected with the \"harvests of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF FISHERIES EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n_May 12th, 1883._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe International Fisheries Exhibition was opened with great ceremony on\r\nthe 12th of May, 1883, by the Prince of Wales, \"by command of Her\r\nMajesty, and on Her Majesty's behalf.\" Most of the members of the Royal\r\nFamily were present, the Foreign Ambassadors and Ministers, Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers, and other distinguished persons. The Prince was\r\naccompanied by the Princess of Wales, Prince Albert Victor, and Prince\r\nGeorge of Wales. The Duke of Richmond, Chairman of the General\r\nCommittee, having read a statement of the object and the contents of the\r\nExhibition, the Prince replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Duke, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--It gives me great\r\n    pleasure to open this International Fisheries Exhibition on\r\n    behalf of the Queen, although I feel assured that it is a matter\r\n    of sincere regret to all present that Her Majesty finds herself\r\n    unable to undertake a duty which it would have afforded her much\r\n    gratification to have performed. In view of the rapid increase\r\n    of the population in all civilized countries, and especially in\r\n    these sea-girt kingdoms, a profound interest attaches to every\r\n    industry which affects the supply of food; and, in this respect,\r\n    the harvest of the sea is hardly less important than that of the\r\n    land. I share your hope that the Exhibition now about to open\r\n    may afford the means of enabling practical fishermen to\r\n    acquaint themselves with the latest improvements which have been\r\n    made in their craft in all parts of the world; so that without\r\n    needless destruction, or avoidable waste of any kind, mankind\r\n    may derive the fullest possible advantage from the bounty of the\r\n    waters. I am glad to hear that your attention has been directed\r\n    to the condition of the fishing population. It is a subject in\r\n    which my brother, the Duke of Edinburgh, was led to take a\r\n    particular interest during his tenure of office as Admiral\r\n    Superintendent of the Naval Reserve; and, as he is compelled to\r\n    be absent during the sittings of the Congress to which you\r\n    allude, I shall have the pleasure of reading a paper on this\r\n    topic which he has prepared at its first meeting. Lifeboats and\r\n    life-saving apparatus undoubtedly fall strictly within the\r\n    province of a fishery exhibition; but I may congratulate you on\r\n    the circumstance that, without overstepping your proper limits,\r\n    you have been able to confer a benefit, not only on all\r\n    fishermen and all sailors by profession, but also on all who\r\n    travel by sea; and in these days of rapid and extensive\r\n    locomotion this means a large proportion of civilized mankind.\r\n    On behalf of the Queen, I add my thanks to those which you\r\n    tender to the Governments of foreign nations and of our colonies\r\n    for their generous co-operation. And to their representatives\r\n    whose untiring exertions you so justly acknowledge, I offer not\r\n    only thanks, but an English welcome.\"\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury having offered a prayer, the Prince\r\ndeclared the Exhibition open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOSING OF FISHERIES EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n_October 31st, 1883._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there ever had been any doubt as to the success of the International\r\nFisheries Exhibition, it had been thoroughly removed long before the end\r\nof the season drew near. The popular interest had been shown from the\r\nbeginning, and the number of visitors exceeded all expectations. The\r\ntotal number of visitors was 2,703,051. The daily average of visitors,\r\nincluding Wednesday, when half-a-crown was the price of admission, was\r\n18,388. The financial result was sure to be satisfactory when such vast\r\nnumbers had been attracted.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of October, the day appointed for closing, Mr. Edward\r\nBirkbeck, M.P., Chairman of the Executive Committee, read to His Royal\r\nHighness the President an address, presenting the chief statistical and\r\nother official reports of the undertaking. One novel feature was the\r\nreport on \"the fish dinners\" supplied with the co-operation of the\r\nNational School of Cookery. No less than 209,673 dinners were supplied,\r\nat sixpence a head, and with satisfactory pecuniary results.\r\n\r\nA Report as to the work of the Juries having been presented by the Duke\r\nof Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales thus replied to the address of the\r\nExecutive Committee:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have listened with great pleasure to the Report of the\r\n    Executive Committee.\r\n\r\n    \"Her Majesty has followed with much interest the success which\r\n    has so signally attended this Exhibition, and I have had the\r\n    gratification of receiving, this morning, a telegram from the\r\n    Queen, begging me to inform you of these sentiments, and\r\n    likewise to express Her Majesty's fervent hope that lasting\r\n    benefit to the fishing population may be the reward of those who\r\n    have shown so much interest in the welfare of this Exhibition.\r\n    And it is as much a matter of satisfaction to my brothers as to\r\n    myself to have contributed towards the success of an enterprise,\r\n    respecting which, at the outset, nothing was certain but the\r\n    heavy responsibility of those who had engaged in it.\r\n\r\n    \"I am well aware that Her Majesty's Government, the Governments\r\n    of Foreign Countries, and of our Colonies, through their\r\n    respective Commissioners, and the various public bodies and\r\n    private persons to whom you have alluded, have afforded most\r\n    valuable and indeed indispensable aid to our undertaking; and I\r\n    desire to add my own thanks to yours for their very important\r\n    assistance.\r\n\r\n    \"But it is just that I should supply the only deficiency which I\r\n    observe in your Report, by pointing out that without the\r\n    administrative capacity and unremitting toil of the Members of\r\n    the Executive Committee, and especially of its Chairman, the\r\n    eminently satisfactory results which you have reported to me\r\n    could not have been attained.\r\n\r\n    \"I learn with much pleasure that, after all expenses are\r\n    defrayed, a substantial surplus will remain in your hands.\r\n\r\n    \"The best method of disposing of that surplus is a matter which\r\n    will need careful consideration. It would be premature to allude\r\n    to any of the various suggestions which have already been put\r\n    forward; but I am of opinion that no proposal will be\r\n    satisfactory to the public, unless it is immediately directed\r\n    towards the carrying out of the objects of the Exhibition from\r\n    which the fund is derived; namely, the promotion of the welfare\r\n    of Fishermen, Fisheries, and the Fishing Industry in general.\r\n\r\n    \"And I think our duty towards the supporters of the Exhibition\r\n    will not be discharged until we have done something towards the\r\n    alleviation of the calamities fatally incidental to the\r\n    Fisherman's calling; and until we have also done something\r\n    towards the promotion of that application of Science to practice\r\n    from which the Fishing Industry, like all other industries, can\r\n    alone look for improvement.\r\n\r\n    \"I believe, that apart from what may be effected by the\r\n    judicious use of the Surplus Fund, the latter end may best be\r\n    attained by the formation of a Society, having for its object\r\n    the collection of statistics and other information relative to\r\n    Fisheries; the diffusion among the fishing population of a\r\n    knowledge of all improvements in the methods and appliances of\r\n    their calling; the discussion of questions bearing upon Fishing\r\n    Interests; and the elucidation of those problems of Natural\r\n    History which bear upon the subject. Such a Society, as the\r\n    representative of the interests of the Fisheries, would\r\n    naturally take charge of the scientific investigations which\r\n    bear upon those interests, and would, no doubt, be brought into\r\n    relation with the Aquarium which you wisely propose to offer to\r\n    the Government, and with the already existing Fishery Museum of\r\n    the Department of Science and Art, which is founded on the\r\n    Collection bequeathed to the nation by the late Mr. Buckland,\r\n    but which has been immensely enlarged and enriched by the\r\n    liberality of many of our exhibitors.\r\n\r\n    \"You have rightly divined that it is a source of great\r\n    gratification to me to be able to continue the work commenced by\r\n    my father in 1851; and, by giving scope for the peaceful\r\n    emulation of the leaders of industry of all nationalities in\r\n    public Exhibitions, to divert the minds of men from those\r\n    international rivalries by which all suffer, to those by which\r\n    all gain.\r\n\r\n    \"The evidence of the public interest in such Exhibitions,\r\n    afforded by the vast concourse of visitors from all parts of the\r\n    realm to that which is now closed, has led me to hope that the\r\n    buildings which have been erected at so much cost, and which\r\n    have so admirably served their purpose, shall continue for the\r\n    next three years to be employed for Exhibitions of a similarly\r\n    comprehensive character.\r\n\r\n    \"In considering what shall be the subject-matter of these\r\n    Exhibitions, three topics of paramount interest to our community\r\n    have presented themselves to my mind. These are Health, both\r\n    bodily and mental; Industrial Inventions; and the\r\n    rapidly-growing resources of our Colonies and of our Indian\r\n    Empire.\r\n\r\n    \"I have expressed a desire that the Exhibition of 1884 will\r\n    embrace the conditions of health, in so far as, like food,\r\n    clothes, and dwellings, they fall under the head of Hygiene, or,\r\n    like appliances for general and technical teaching, gymnasia and\r\n    schools, under that of Education.\r\n\r\n    \"The question of the Patent Laws has for many years engaged the\r\n    attention of all those interested in the progress of invention\r\n    and the just reward of the inventor. I am advised that the\r\n    Patent Act of last Session will afford a satisfactory solution\r\n    of the difficulties which beset this subject, and will be\r\n    especially useful to the poor inventor by enabling him to obtain\r\n    protection for his invention at a considerably reduced rate, and\r\n    in a manner which will be more advantageous to him.\r\n\r\n    \"Under these circumstances, it has appeared to me that much good\r\n    may result from an Exhibition in the year 1885, showing the\r\n    Progress of Invention, especially in labour-saving machinery,\r\n    since 1862; that is to say, since the last great International\r\n    Exhibition held in this country.\r\n\r\n    \"At the close of the Paris Exhibition of 1868, I had the\r\n    satisfaction of receiving from the Colonial Commissioners an\r\n    address, in which great stress was laid on the desirability of\r\n    establishing a permanent Colonial Museum in London, as a\r\n    powerful means of diffusing throughout the Mother Country a\r\n    better knowledge of the nature and importance of the several\r\n    Dependencies of the Empire, of facilitating commercial\r\n    relations, marking progress, and aiding the researches of men of\r\n    science, and also of affording valuable information to\r\n    intending emigrants.\r\n\r\n    \"At that time I was able to do little more than to assure the\r\n    Commissioners of my readiness to promote such a scheme, and to\r\n    recommend the respective Governments to give it their full\r\n    consideration.\r\n\r\n    \"I trust that the British Colonial Exhibition which I propose to\r\n    hold in 1886, may result in the foundation of such a Museum--the\r\n    institution of which would secure for the people of this country\r\n    a permanent record of the resources and development of Her\r\n    Majesty's Colonies; and I hope that an important section of the\r\n    proposed Exhibition of that year may result from the\r\n    co-operation of our fellow-subjects, the people of India, in a\r\n    suitable representation of the industrial arts of that Empire.\r\n\r\n    \"In conclusion, I desire, as President of these Exhibitions, to\r\n    thank the Special Commissioners, the Members of the General\r\n    Committee, and the Jurors, for the time and labour they have\r\n    devoted to the business of the Exhibition; and to express my\r\n    high approbation of the cheerfulness and assiduity with which\r\n    the members of the Executive Staff have discharged their very\r\n    onerous duties.\r\n\r\n    \"And I must finally signalize, as especially deserving of our\r\n    gratitude, my brother, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the other\r\n    foreign and English gentlemen, to whom we are indebted for the\r\n    bestowal of much time and thought upon the papers which have\r\n    been brought before those Conferences, which have formed so\r\n    interesting and so useful a feature of the Exhibition. I am glad\r\n    to hear that the value of the contribution to Fishery\r\n    Literature, effected by the publication of these papers and the\r\n    discussions to which they gave rise, has received authoritative\r\n    recognition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL RESULTS OF FISHERIES EXHIBITION, AND DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all the affairs of the Exhibition of 1883 had been wound up,\r\nincluding the financial accounts, a meeting of the General Committee was\r\nheld on Saturday, March 22nd, 1884, to receive the Report of the\r\nExecutive Committee. Details of receipts and outlay were presented.\r\nReference was made to the wide interest awakened by the Exhibition, the\r\nattendance of fishermen from many lands, as well as from all parts of\r\nthe United Kingdom, and the success of the attempt to sell fish at\r\nprices hitherto unknown in our great towns. The Report and Balance Sheet\r\nhaving been presented, the Prince of Wales thus spoke:--\r\n\r\n    \"You have all listened, I am sure, with great interest to the\r\n    report that has been read to you by the Chairman of the\r\n    Executive Committee. From what we have heard, I think it is\r\n    patent to all that the late Fisheries Exhibition has in every\r\n    point of view been a success. It has been a financial success,\r\n    and it has also been a success as regards the enormous number of\r\n    people who have visited it, not only of our own countrymen and\r\n    those from our colonies, but from every part of the globe. It is\r\n    unnecessary for me on an occasion of this kind to enumerate the\r\n    objects of this Exhibition, but I maintain that its two salient\r\n    objects--viz., the scientific and practical ones--have fully\r\n    justified its existence: its scientific object by the display of\r\n    every possible kind of modern appliance, thus showing the great\r\n    improvements that have been made in the fishing industry of the\r\n    world; and its practical object because it not only showed to\r\n    our own countrymen, but to all the world, what a valuable means\r\n    of subsistence fish is. Many, I believe, had no idea of its\r\n    value; while the existence of varieties of fish was made known\r\n    which had not even been heard of by the great majority of\r\n    people. Well, gentlemen, you have all heard that there is a\r\n    surplus amounting to £15,243, and the question is naturally how\r\n    to employ that sum. In the address that I read to you at the\r\n    closing of the Exhibition I held out some hope that this might\r\n    be applied in a useful and practical manner, and I would\r\n    therefore now suggest to the General Committee that one of the\r\n    best objects by which to perpetuate the results of this\r\n    successful Exhibition would be to appropriate, say, about\r\n    £10,000 to alleviate the distress of widows and orphans of sea\r\n    fishermen. I use the words 'alleviate the distress' because I do\r\n    not wish to bind any of you to our erecting an orphanage. That\r\n    would cost a great deal of money, and, I think, would possibly\r\n    be a mistake. If we were to embark in any great building\r\n    enterprise of that kind, and in future find ourselves in debt,\r\n    we should have frustrated the very object we have in view, viz.,\r\n    supporting the widows and orphans of those brave men who peril\r\n    their lives at sea. I would also suggest that £3000 should be\r\n    given as an endowment to a society, which might be called the\r\n    Royal Fisheries Society. What shape that might take will be for\r\n    your future consideration; but possibly some society might be\r\n    founded under such a name or character, similar to the Royal\r\n    Agricultural Society. We shall then have a surplus of about\r\n    £2000 left, which, I think you will all agree, will be a good\r\n    thing to keep in reserve. It would be for the general public in\r\n    future to show their interest in this scheme by supporting it to\r\n    the best of their ability. I beg, therefore, to move the\r\n    following resolution:--'That a sum of £10,000 be invested, with\r\n    a view to applying the proceeds to the assistance of families\r\n    who have suffered the loss of a father or husband in the\r\n    prosecution of his calling as a sea fisherman; and that a\r\n    further sum of £3000 be applied to the formation of a Fisheries\r\n    Society, such as was suggested by His Royal Highness the\r\n    President in his reply to the report of the Executive Committee\r\n    on the 31st of October, 1883.'\"\r\n\r\nThat suggestion was that a society should be formed, having for its\r\nobject the collection of statistics and other information relative to\r\nFisheries; the diffusing among the fishing population of a knowledge of\r\nall improvements in the methods and appliances of their calling; the\r\ndiscussion of questions bearing upon fishing interests: we wish we could\r\nadd, \"the interests of the public,\" in obtaining more and cheaper fish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW CITY OF LONDON SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n_December 12th, 1882._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe large and commodious building on the Embankment, which is the new\r\nseat of the old \"City of London School,\" was formally opened by the\r\nPrince of Wales, accompanied by the Princess of Wales, on the 12th of\r\nDecember, 1882. The Lord Mayor, in state, the masters of the principal\r\nCity Companies, and a large assembly of civic and educational notables\r\nwere present. The Lord Mayor having given an address on the history of\r\nthe school, and the work done by the Corporation in connection with it,\r\nasked the Prince to declare the new building open.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, after expressing the gratification it gave to himself and\r\nthe Princess to take part in the proceedings of the day, and, having\r\nthanked the Lord Mayor for the historical address, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"After what you have all heard with regard to the existence of\r\n    this school, it will be hardly necessary for me to add more than\r\n    a very few words. I also express my fervent hope that a school\r\n    such as this one, which has flourished for a space of between\r\n    forty and fifty years, will continue ever to do so. It is a\r\n    palpable fact that many pupils have gone up to the Universities,\r\n    and taken high degrees, both in Classics at Oxford and in\r\n    Mathematics at Cambridge. The present Head Master is one of\r\n    those who took high honours at Cambridge. Last, but not least,\r\n    the Lord Mayor himself was educated in this school, and is the\r\n    first boy who has reached that high position.\r\n\r\n    \"I must congratulate the architect, and all those who have\r\n    designed and built this school. I feel convinced from what we\r\n    have seen that it is an admirably suited building for all\r\n    educational purposes. Its site, close to the Thames, where it\r\n    will get fresh air, and the admirable manner in which all the\r\n    rooms are constructed, promise well for the future. Let me once\r\n    again express a fervent hope that, under the blessing of God, it\r\n    will continue to flourish and prosper. I now declare the new\r\n    buildings open.\"\r\n\r\nThe announcement was received with great cheering, with a flourish of\r\ntrumpets. The present Head Master, Dr. Abbott, worthily sustains the\r\nreputation which the school held under Dr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHBROOK CLUB.\r\n\r\n_May 21st, 1883._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening of the club, in Whitehall Gardens, named after the Earl of\r\nNorthbrook, for the use of native gentlemen from the East Indies and\r\ntheir friends, attracted a large and influential assemblage. By the\r\nrequest of Lord Northbrook the Prince of Wales declared the club open.\r\nHe said that, after the clear and full statement by Lord Northbrook, he\r\nhad little to say about the objects and advantages of the club. After\r\nexpressing his gratification at being invited to be present, he said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have not forgotten--and I address this especially to those\r\n    gentlemen who come from India--nor am I likely ever to forget,\r\n    the magnificent reception I met with in India, not only from the\r\n    Native Princes, but from every class in India; and the interest\r\n    I take in all that concerns Her Majesty's Indian empire I assure\r\n    you will ever continue. I think it highly desirable that a club\r\n    of this nature should have been formed, so as to bring natives\r\n    of India into direct communication with our own countrymen, and\r\n    that facilities should be afforded them to find a comfortable\r\n    place where they can meet together for the interchange of ideas,\r\n    and where they can seek relaxation after their labours in the\r\n    professions which they have come here to study. That it will be\r\n    found in every respect desirable, I am sure, and I have not the\r\n    smallest doubt that it will be successful. I am glad to hear\r\n    from Lord Northbrook of the money which has come from India. It\r\n    is gratifying to know that the Indian Princes have been\r\n    magnanimous in their subscriptions, and have shown the great\r\n    interest they take in the success of the undertaking. I heartily\r\n    wish prosperity to the Northbrook Club.\"\r\n\r\nSome letters from India having been read, and several native gentlemen\r\nhaving been presented, the Prince made a tour of the club with the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY OF LONDON COLLEGE IN MOORFIELDS.\r\n\r\n_July 8th, 1883._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City of London College, which has spacious premises in White Street,\r\nMoorfields, is intended for giving educational advantages to young men,\r\nchiefly by means of evening classes for those engaged in business or\r\nwork during the day. It was originally established, in 1848, at Crosby\r\nHall, moving from there to Sussex Hall, Leadenhall Street, and finally\r\nsettled in the new building in Moorfields, the cost of which was\r\n£16,000. To inaugurate this new College, the Prince of Wales,\r\naccompanied by the Princess, went to the City. After being shown over\r\nthe building their Royal Highnesses were conducted by the Lord Mayor to\r\nthe great hall, which is capable of holding about 1000 persons, and\r\nwhich was densely filled.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Prebendary Whittington, Principal of the College, read an\r\naddress thanking the Prince for his presence, and stating the objects of\r\nthe College. He mentioned that in 1858 the Prince Consort paid a visit\r\nto Crosby Hall, and testified his approval of the work done for the\r\nintellectual, social, and moral improvement of the young men of London,\r\nby consenting to become the first patron, an office which had since his\r\ndeath been filled by the Queen. Her Majesty had testified her continued\r\napproval by a generous donation to the new building fund.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ladies and Gentlemen,--It is with sincere pleasure that I thank\r\n    you on behalf of the Princess of Wales, as well as on my own,\r\n    for the loyal address of welcome which has just been presented\r\n    to us, and for being given this opportunity of expressing to you\r\n    our approval of your efforts for the improvement of the\r\n    intellectual, social, moral, and spiritual condition of the\r\n    young men of this vast metropolis. Such occasions are always\r\n    fraught with the deepest interest to me, recalling as they do\r\n    the memory of my beloved father, the Prince Consort, who devoted\r\n    his time, his experience, and his great abilities to the\r\n    promotion of undertakings such as the one you now have in hand,\r\n    to which he lent his countenance by becoming its first patron,\r\n    and which the Queen still encourages by her patronage. We\r\n    sincerely trust our presence here to-day may encourage others to\r\n    take an interest in this great undertaking, and we rejoice to be\r\n    able to declare your new building open.\"\r\n\r\nA prayer for the continued success of the institution was then offered\r\nup by Bishop Claughton, and the Old Hundredth Psalm was sung.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary then read a list of subscriptions, including fifty guineas\r\nfrom the Prince of Wales. The Lord Mayor said that the Prince always\r\nshowed his interest in education, and he had lately been present at the\r\nopening of the City of London School. This College gave more advanced\r\nand practical teaching than was given at that School.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke, Q.C., M.P., said he had been a student of the College\r\ntwenty-six or twenty-seven years ago, and the education he there\r\nreceived had been most valuable to him. Mr. Prebendary Mackenzie having\r\nsupported the resolution of a vote of thanks to their Royal Highnesses,\r\nthe Prince returned his warm thanks and added:--\r\n\r\n    \"So much has been said with regard to this College that I should\r\n    only be taking up your time if I were to allude to it further\r\n    than to say that I feel convinced--and it is our earnest\r\n    hope--that this College, which has been so successful hitherto,\r\n    will continue to prosper in the new building. Most cordially do\r\n    we wish it all success. A greater proof cannot be given of the\r\n    excellent character of the education which the students here\r\n    receive than that given by the seconder of the resolution, Mr.\r\n    Clarke, who has not only attained a high position in the\r\n    profession he has adopted, but who has also become a member of\r\n    Parliament. I thank you again for your kind reception of us\r\n    to-day, and for the pleasure it has given us to inaugurate this\r\n    very handsome building.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSING OF THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASSES.\r\n\r\n_February 22nd, 1884._\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is not infrequent in his\r\nattendance in the House of Lords, but he has very rarely addressed the\r\nHouse. It is natural that he should avoid even the appearance of being\r\nmixed up with political controversies, or touching points that might\r\nbear a party construction. But on questions of a social or patriotic\r\nbearing to which he is known to have given personal attention, the voice\r\nof the Prince would be always heard with pleasure, and his opinions\r\ncarry due weight. It was so in the matter of the Housing of the Poor,\r\nwhich was brought before the House on the 22nd of February, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Salisbury moved an Address to Her Majesty for the\r\nappointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the housing of the\r\nworking classes. Lord Carington seconded the motion, after which the\r\nPrince of Wales rose, amidst cheers from both sides of the House. He\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords,--The speeches which have fallen from the lips of the\r\n    noble Marquis who introduced this subject, and from the noble\r\n    Lord who has just sat down, cannot fail to have been heard with\r\n    the deepest interest by your Lordships. I feel also convinced\r\n    that your Lordships, in common with all classes of Her Majesty's\r\n    subjects, will be gratified to learn that the noble Marquis has\r\n    asked for a searching inquiry to be made into that great and\r\n    momentous question with regard to the housing, and the\r\n    amelioration of the dwellings, of the poor and the working,\r\n    classes, and that Her Majesty's Government have already\r\n    appointed a Commission for that purpose.\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords, it is not my intention to trouble your Lordships with\r\n    many remarks, though I take the keenest and liveliest interest\r\n    in this great question. Still, I confess I have not gone\r\n    sufficiently into the matter for me to venture on giving an\r\n    opinion, especially after what has fallen from the noble Marquis\r\n    and the noble Lord. At the same time, I can assure you, my\r\n    Lords, that I am deeply flattered at having been appointed a\r\n    member of the Royal Commission. The subject of the housing of\r\n    the poor is not entirely unknown to me, as having acquired a\r\n    property in Norfolk now for twenty years, I have had something\r\n    to do in building fresh dwellings for the poor and working\r\n    classes. On arriving there I found the dwellings in the most\r\n    deplorable condition, but I hope now that there is hardly one on\r\n    the estate who can complain of not being adequately housed.\r\n\r\n    \"I quite endorse what has fallen from the noble Marquis and the\r\n    quotation which he made from the letter of Mr. Williams which\r\n    appeared in to-day's newspapers. A few days ago I visited two of\r\n    the poorest courts in the district of St. Pancras and Holborn,\r\n    where, I can assure you, my Lords, that the condition of the\r\n    people, or rather of their dwellings, was perfectly disgraceful.\r\n    This in itself proves to me how important it is that there\r\n    should be a thoroughly searching inquiry. As your Lordships are\r\n    aware, there have existed now for some short space of time\r\n    several private societies organised for the purpose of inquiring\r\n    into this very question. I am sure that we ought all to be\r\n    grateful to these gentlemen for giving up their time to so\r\n    important a subject, and I feel that the Royal Commission can in\r\n    nowise clash with the efforts of these private individuals.\r\n\r\n    \"In conclusion, my Lords, I wish to say that I cherish an\r\n    earnest hope, which I feel will be shared by your Lordships,\r\n    that the result of this Royal Commission will be a\r\n    recommendation to Parliament of measures of a drastic and\r\n    thorough kind, which may be the means of not only improving the\r\n    dwellings of the poor, but of ameliorating their condition\r\n    generally.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness was followed by Lord Shaftesbury, the Bishop of\r\nLondon, and others, but nothing was added in the debate of a practical\r\nnature, and the motion of Lord Salisbury was unanimously carried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUARDS' INDUSTRIAL HOME AT CHELSEA\r\nBARRACKS.\r\n\r\n_February 25th, 1884._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales, accompanied by the Princess Louise,\r\nMarchioness of Lorne, and the Princesses Louise, Victoria, and Maude of\r\nWales, visited Chelsea Barracks on Monday, the 25th of February, 1884,\r\nfor the distribution of prizes to the girls at the Guards' Industrial\r\nHome. It is very honourable to the officers of the Guards, that they\r\nprovide as far as they can for the welfare of the wives and families of\r\nthe soldiers, as well as of the men of their regiments. The boys\r\neducated in the regimental schools were easily provided for, but for the\r\ntraining of the girls for useful occupations it had been advisable to\r\nestablish this Industrial Home in the neighbourhood of the barracks.\r\nThis was explained by General Higginson, commanding the brigade of\r\nGuards in the Home district, and a report of the state of the\r\ninstitution during the past year was read by Colonel Cockran, the\r\nhonorary secretary.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales then distributed the prizes to the girls, in his\r\nusual kindly manner. General Higginson, in the name of the brigade,\r\nthanked their Royal Highnesses for the proof they had given of their\r\nfavour and good will. The Prince replied--\r\n\r\n    \"General Higginson, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--The Princess begs me\r\n    to return her warmest thanks for the very kind words in which\r\n    you have expressed your thanks to her on behalf of the brigade\r\n    for taking part in the ceremony which we have just witnessed. I\r\n    know I am only expressing her views when I state that it has\r\n    given her sincere pleasure to be here, and that she shares with\r\n    me an interest in everything which concerns the brigade of\r\n    Guards. After what has fallen from you, General Higginson, and\r\n    after the reading of the report, there is little left for me to\r\n    say beyond congratulating those who founded this institution and\r\n    those who so ably maintain it, upon the highly satisfactory way\r\n    in which it is managed and upon the creditable manner in which,\r\n    as we know, every detail connected with its working is\r\n    conducted. We sincerely hope that those young ladies who have\r\n    to-day received prizes will go forth to pursue their avocations\r\n    in life with credit both to themselves and to the instruction\r\n    they have received in this institution. We trust that having\r\n    reached its 21st anniversary--the coming of age of the Guards'\r\n    Industrial Home--the institution will ever continue to flourish.\r\n    For my own part, I may say, General Higginson, that I think all\r\n    the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the\r\n    Household Brigade are aware of the deep feeling which I\r\n    entertain towards them, and that I have not forgotten my\r\n    association with them three-and-twenty years ago. That feeling\r\n    of kindliness towards them, and of interest in all that concerns\r\n    them, will continue to the day of my death.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony was over, there was an amateur theatrical\r\nperformance, to the great amusement not only of the young folk, but of\r\nthe crowd of spectators who filled the hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL NATIONAL LIFEBOAT INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n_March 15th, 1884._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales presided, not for the first time, at the annual\r\nmeeting of the Lifeboat Institution, which was held at Willis's Rooms on\r\nthe 15th of March, 1884. The Secretary, Mr. C. Dibdin, having read the\r\nreport, the Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ladies and Gentlemen,--Before calling upon the noble duke (the\r\n    Duke of Argyll) to move the first resolution, I wish to say a\r\n    few words. You have all of you, I feel convinced, heard with the\r\n    greatest interest the report which has just been read by the\r\n    secretary, and I think we must all be unanimous in the opinion\r\n    that that report is highly satisfactory as regards everything\r\n    connected with this institution.\r\n\r\n    \"The National Lifeboat Institution, having been founded in 1824,\r\n    has now reached its sixtieth anniversary, and I think you will\r\n    all agree with me that there is no institution throughout our\r\n    country which is of greater importance or more demands our\r\n    sympathy and assistance. From our geographical position as a\r\n    sea-girt isle, and from the immense colonies which we have\r\n    acquired, the mass of ships that travel to and fro and reach our\r\n    islands is almost too vast to enable us even to realize what\r\n    their number can actually be. Those vessels naturally encounter\r\n    tempests, the results of which are shipwrecks and loss of life.\r\n    The risks especially which that valuable and important\r\n    community, the fishermen on our coasts, have to run from the\r\n    beginning to the end of the year must be well known to you all.\r\n    It is especially to save their lives, and not only theirs, but\r\n    the lives of all who travel on the sea, that this great national\r\n    institution has been founded. Strange to say that\r\n    notwithstanding the great improvements which have been effected\r\n    in navigation and in the different scientific inventions which\r\n    have been made, there is no doubt that an increase of shipwrecks\r\n    annually occurs.\r\n\r\n    \"I may mention that it must have been of interest to those of\r\n    you who visited the Fisheries Exhibition last year to notice all\r\n    the models of boats, contrivances for fishing, and apparatus for\r\n    saving life which were there shown to you. It must be patent to\r\n    everybody that a society of this kind is an absolute necessity.\r\n    Look at what it has done. Since its foundation nearly 31,000\r\n    lives have been saved by its instrumentality. Already this year\r\n    up to now--the middle of March--300 lives have been saved, and\r\n    last year the total number was nearly 1000. The institution has\r\n    now 274 lifeboats, and no doubt you are fully aware, through the\r\n    medium of the Press, of the gallantry which has been displayed\r\n    by the coxswains and crews of those boats. This is so well known\r\n    to you, I am sure, that I need not engross your attention by\r\n    dwelling upon the topic. Of one thing, however, I must remind\r\n    you. I must impress upon your minds the fact that, although we\r\n    admit this to be a national and most important institution, it\r\n    is at the same time entirely supported by voluntary\r\n    contributions. Therefore I most urgently ask you to ponder well\r\n    over this fact, and impress upon you the great necessity which\r\n    exists for keeping it up and maintaining it in a state of\r\n    efficiency with adequate funds. A large annual income is, of\r\n    course, required for this purpose. To maintain a lifeboat\r\n    station in a good state £70 per annum is needed.\r\n\r\n    \"Allusion has been made in the report to the fact that the\r\n    Princess of Wales has become a vice-patroness of this\r\n    institution, and I need hardly tell you that she shares with me\r\n    all the views that I hold in relation to it. It was a great\r\n    gratification to her quite recently to present medals to two of\r\n    the most deserving coxswains who had distinguished themselves\r\n    in saving lives. Upon the utility and merits of this\r\n    institution one might speak for hours, but our meeting to-day is\r\n    for business, and not merely for the purpose of delivering\r\n    addresses; so I will now call upon the Duke of Argyll to move\r\n    the first resolution.\"\r\n\r\nSpeeches having been made by the Duke of Argyll, Admiral Sir H. Keppell,\r\nLord Charles Beresford, and the Lord Mayor (Fowler), and resolutions\r\npassed, the Duke of Northumberland proposed a vote of thanks to the\r\nPrince of Wales for presiding, who in responding said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I assure you it has been a source of sincere gratification to\r\n    me to take the chair on this occasion. I assure you also that\r\n    nobody more cordially wishes this institution continued success\r\n    and prosperity than I do. It is a thoroughly national and useful\r\n    institution, and if it is only as ably managed and conducted in\r\n    the future as it has been in the past, I feel convinced it will\r\n    continue to flourish. I know how much we ought to feel grateful\r\n    to those who have undertaken the arduous duty of managing this\r\n    institution, for giving their valuable time and assistance, and\r\n    bow much our hearts ought always to go with those I brave and\r\n    gallant men who seek to rescue the lives of their\r\n    fellow-countrymen in all weathers, and in all times by day or\r\n    night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEALTH EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n_June 17th, 1884._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lamented death of the Duke of Albany on the 28th of March,\r\n1884, prevented the Prince of Wales from taking active part in the\r\npreparations for the Health Exhibition of that summer. He had\r\nbefore arranged, along with the Executive Council, of which the\r\nDuke of Buckingham was Chairman, the general plan of the\r\nExhibition, in the designs of which Prince Leopold had taken deep\r\ninterest. On the 17th of June the Prince formally inaugurated\r\nthe work of the international juries, a necessary and important\r\npart of the whole undertaking. It was the first occasion in\r\nwhich His Royal Highness had taken part in public affairs since\r\nthe death of his brother. The meeting took place in the Albert\r\nHall, and a great assembly had gathered, including many distinguished\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buckingham, on behalf of the Executive Council, expressed\r\nthe great gratification they felt at the appearance of His Royal\r\nHighness among them, as to him was due the inception of the undertaking.\r\nSir James Paget, the Vice-Chairman of the Council, delivered an\r\nelaborate and eloquent address on the purposes and the importance of the\r\nExhibition. He was followed by Sir Lyon Playfair. After these addresses\r\nLord Reay presented to His Royal Highness, the Foreign Commissioners,\r\nand the Chairmen and Jurors for the different sections. The Prince then\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Excellencies, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--Owing to a very sad\r\n    cause I was unable to open the Health Exhibition. But I am\r\n    particularly glad to have had this opportunity of being present\r\n    to preside here to-day on the occasion of the assembling of the\r\n    international juries. It has given me great pleasure to have\r\n    made the personal acquaintance of all those distinguished\r\n    gentlemen who have come from the Continent, and who, no doubt at\r\n    considerable inconvenience to themselves, have so kindly\r\n    consented to come over here to decide on matters appertaining to\r\n    the Health Exhibition. It is particularly gratifying to me to\r\n    have been here to receive them, and I sincerely hope that their\r\n    labours will be crowned with success. That the Exhibition has up\r\n    to the present time been successful so far as numbers are\r\n    concerned we have evidence to show, but I hope at the same time\r\n    that for scientific and educational purposes the public at large\r\n    may derive even greater benefit from it than they can get by\r\n    merely coming here to enjoy the Exhibition as a place of\r\n    recreation.\r\n\r\n    \"After the address from the Duke of Buckingham, and the long,\r\n    able, and most interesting one from Sir James Paget, which was\r\n    commented upon by Sir Lyon Playfair, it would be perfectly\r\n    superfluous for me to detain you but for a few moments on any\r\n    subject relating to health. These addresses, which you have all\r\n    listened to with such great interest, will, I trust, have proved\r\n    to you what an important consideration the matter of health is.\r\n    This Exhibition, under the able chairmanship of the Duke of\r\n    Buckingham and those gentlemen of the Executive Council who have\r\n    worked under him, has, I think, been brought to a remarkable\r\n    degree of perfection. They have done everything they can do to\r\n    make it pleasing to the eye; but still I hope that those who\r\n    visit the Exhibition will remember that there are greater and\r\n    more important objects at stake--that they will go home\r\n    impressed by the study of those objects as well as by the\r\n    pleasure they may have derived from the wonderful inventions and\r\n    methods of showing them. I wish to tender my thanks to the Lord\r\n    Mayor and the great City Companies for their kind co-operation\r\n    in this Exhibition, and I am sure we are all much gratified at\r\n    the success of what is called Old London. Before concluding I\r\n    would beg to ask the Chairmen and Jurors at the close of the\r\n    proceedings to constitute their juries and select their\r\n    secretaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe French Ambassador, in moving a vote of thanks to the Prince of Wales\r\nfor presiding, referred to His Royal Highness's readiness on all\r\noccasions to give his time and to devote his energies to any cause which\r\nmight advance the welfare of the people of this country. He called on\r\nthem to thank His Royal Highness, not only in the name of those present\r\nand of the foreigners who had contributed to the Exhibition, and more\r\nparticularly those of France, but in the name of thousands upon\r\nthousands of the poor and disinherited of the earth, of children and the\r\nhelpless, whose benefit would ultimately be promoted by this Exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor seconded the motion, which was agreed to with\r\nacclamation. The Prince, in closing the proceedings, tendered his\r\nwarmest thanks to the French Ambassador and his colleagues for their\r\npresence on that occasion and for their continued co-operation in the\r\nExhibitions with which he had been connected. His Royal Highness, in\r\nconcluding, thanked the Lord Mayor, as representative of the City of\r\nLondon, for all that the City and the Guilds of London had done to\r\npromote the success of the Exhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF GUILDS OF LONDON INSTITUTE.\r\n\r\n_June 25th, 1884._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe building, of which the foundation was laid nearly three years\r\nbefore, was completed within the time originally contracted for, and the\r\nPrince of Wales came to open it on the 25th of June, 1884. Again the\r\nLord Chancellor read the report, and on behalf of the Governors and\r\nCouncil of the City and Guilds of London Institute, thanked His Royal\r\nHighness for his continued interest, and his presence that day. Touching\r\nallusion was made to the death of the Duke of Albany, who had laid the\r\nfoundation stone of the Finsbury Technical College in May 1881. \"As\r\nyears roll by, and when the connection between the technical education\r\nof the people and the commercial prosperity of the country becomes as\r\nwell understood and appreciated here as it is abroad, the year 1880, in\r\nwhich the City and Guilds of London Institute was incorporated, and the\r\nyear 1884, in which this central institution was opened, will stand out\r\nas epochs in what we hope may be an unbroken record of industrial\r\nprogress; and we sincerely trust that the remembrance of this day's\r\nproceedings may ever furnish to your Royal Highness a pleasing and\r\nsatisfactory thought, enabling you to associate the endeavours of your\r\nillustrious father, dating back more than thirty years, to improve the\r\narts and manufactures of the country, with the work of this Technical\r\nInstitute, over which your Royal Highness so graciously presides.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Chancellor, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I have listened\r\n    with attention to your address, and I assure you it gives me\r\n    great pleasure to be able to preside at the opening of this\r\n    important institution, the first pillar of which, in company\r\n    with her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, I set nearly\r\n    three years since. I thank you for your very feeling reference\r\n    to the severe loss which the Queen, and each member of Her\r\n    Majesty's family, has sustained by the untimely death of my late\r\n    brother. His interest in every movement calculated to humanize\r\n    and to elevate the people of this country will, I am quite sure,\r\n    cause his loss to be felt far beyond the circle of his immediate\r\n    friends.\r\n\r\n    \"I have been gratified that the City and the Livery Companies of\r\n    London have so generously responded to the letter which, as\r\n    President of the Institute, I addressed some few months since to\r\n    the Lord Mayor and to the Worshipful Masters of the Livery\r\n    Companies of London. This Institute, which owes its origin to\r\n    the liberality of the City and of the Guilds of London, is an\r\n    illustration of the excellent work that may be done by united\r\n    action, which could not possibly be accomplished by individual\r\n    efforts. Conformably with the traditions of these ancient\r\n    Guilds, there is, perhaps, no purpose to which they could more\r\n    appropriately devote their surplus funds, and none which would\r\n    be of more practical advantage to the country at large than the\r\n    promotion of technical education. The altered conditions of\r\n    apprenticeship, and the almost general substitution of machine\r\n    for hand labour have made the teaching of science, in its\r\n    application to productive industry, a necessary part of the\r\n    training of all classes of persons engaged in manufacturing\r\n    pursuits.\r\n\r\n    \"There never was a time, perhaps, when the importance of\r\n    technical education was more generally recognized than now, and\r\n    I am gratified to learn from the report of the Royal\r\n    Commissioners appointed to inquire into the subject to which\r\n    your lordship has referred, that, although we are still behind\r\n    many of our foreign neighbours in the provision of technical\r\n    schools of different grades, the encouragement afforded by the\r\n    State to the teaching of science and of art, supplemented as it\r\n    now is by the Institute's assistance to the teaching of\r\n    technology, has placed within reach of our artizan population\r\n    facilities for technical instruction which have already\r\n    influenced, and which promise to influence still more in the\r\n    future, the progress of our manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\n    \"As president of this Institute, I have noted with much\r\n    satisfaction the rapid development of the work which the Council\r\n    have initiated, and which they so successfully control. I am\r\n    anxious to take this opportunity of expressing in public what is\r\n    already known to you, my Lord Chancellor, and to the members of\r\n    the Council, the obligations which we are all under to Mr.\r\n    Philip Magnus, our able director and secretary, for his\r\n    unwearied exertions in having so successfully accomplished the\r\n    organization of the practical work of the institution. I have no\r\n    doubt that the opportunities for advanced instruction, which\r\n    will be afforded in the well-arranged laboratories and workshops\r\n    of this building, will enable the managers and superintendents\r\n    of our manufacturing works to obtain more readily than hitherto\r\n    that higher technical instruction which is so essential to the\r\n    development of our trade and commerce.\r\n\r\n    \"But it is especially as a training college for teachers that\r\n    this institution will occupy an important place in the\r\n    educational establishments of this country. The demand for\r\n    technical instruction has increased so rapidly during the last\r\n    few years that the supply of teachers has not kept pace with it,\r\n    and I have noticed with satisfaction that in the scheme for the\r\n    organization of this school due prominence is given to the\r\n    provision of gratuitous courses of instruction for technical\r\n    teachers from all parts of the kingdom. I shall be glad to see\r\n    other corporations and individuals follow the example of the\r\n    Clothworkers' Company, by establishing scholarships which shall\r\n    serve to connect the elementary schools of this country with\r\n    this institution. Hitherto, all schools have led up to the\r\n    Universities, and literary training has been encouraged to the\r\n    disadvantage of scientific instruction. Manufacturing industry\r\n    has, consequently, not been able to attract to its pursuits its\r\n    fair proportion of the best intellect of the country. The\r\n    foundation of scholarships in connection with this institution\r\n    will enable selected pupils from elementary schools to enter\r\n    schools of a higher grade, and to complete their education\r\n    within these walls.\r\n\r\n    \"As president of the International Health Exhibition, I am glad\r\n    that the Council of this Institute have been able to place at\r\n    the disposal of the Council of the Health Exhibition a portion\r\n    of this building for the exhibition of apparatus and appliances\r\n    used in technical and other schools. I have no doubt that we\r\n    shall find in that exhibition, which I hope to be able presently\r\n    to visit, much that is generally instructive, and that the\r\n    foreign sections will contain exhibits which will prove of great\r\n    interest to the educational authorities of this country. To the\r\n    Corporation and to the Livery Companies of London, the Council\r\n    of the International Health Exhibition are indebted for much\r\n    valuable assistance, and I thank them for it.\r\n\r\n    \"It now only remains for me to declare the Central Institution\r\n    of the City and Guilds of London Institute to be open, and to\r\n    express the warmest hope that the important educational work to\r\n    be carried on in this great national school of technical science\r\n    and art will help to promote the development of our leading\r\n    industries, and that the City and Guilds of London, which have\r\n    so liberally subscribed funds for the erection and equipment of\r\n    this institution, will maintain it with efficiency, and will at\r\n    the same time continue their support to all other parts of the\r\n    Institute's operations.\"\r\n\r\nAfter short speeches by Lord Carlingford, Mr. Mundella, and the Lord\r\nMayor, the Prince inspected the various parts of the Institute,\r\nincluding the rooms where specimens of the work of students of the\r\nFinsbury College, and where exhibits from foreign technical schools were\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY MEETING IN GUILDHALL.\r\n\r\n_August 1st, 1884._\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most important meetings presided over by the Prince of Wales,\r\nand one of the most memorable gatherings for many a year past seen in\r\nthe City of London, was that held in the Guildhall, on the 1st of\r\nAugust, 1884. The object was to celebrate the Jubilee of the Abolition\r\nof Slavery in the British Colonies, to recall the work of the British\r\nand Foreign Anti-Slavery Society during the last half-century, and to\r\nconsider the position and prospects of the slavery question at the\r\npresent time throughout the world.\r\n\r\nIt was in every respect a most remarkable meeting. The great Hall was\r\ndensely crowded from end to end. On the platform were assembled large\r\nnumbers of distinguished persons, of different creeds, and opposite\r\npolitical parties, but all united in the cause which had brought them\r\ntogether that day. The names of a few of those present will show how\r\nvarious were the classes thus represented. The Lord Mayor (Alderman\r\nFowler, M.P.), and the Chief Magistrates of London, the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and Cardinal Manning, Earl Granville and the Earl of Derby,\r\nSir Stafford Northcote and Mr. W. E. Forster, Mr. Sergeant Simon. Sir\r\nWilfrid Lawson, Mr. T. R. Potter, Mr. Henry Richard, and many other\r\nleading members of Parliament, sat together on the same platform. There\r\nwere present a few of the veterans who had taken part in the\r\nanti-slavery struggles fifty years before, such as Joseph Sturge and Sir\r\nHarry Verney, M.P. Descendants of the early champions of the cause,\r\nbearing the honoured names of Wilberforce, Lushington, Buxton, Pease,\r\nForster, showed that the spirit of their fathers was maintained in a new\r\ngeneration. Among the ladies on the platform were the Baroness\r\nBurdett-Coutts, Miss Gordon, the sister of General Gordon, of Khartoum,\r\nand some members of the Society of Friends, always abounding in good\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Society read a list of names of those unable to be\r\npresent, but expressing warm sympathy with the purpose of the meeting.\r\nThere were letters from the Chief Rabbi, from Lord Salisbury, the Duke\r\nof Norfolk, the Duke of Sutherland, the Duke of Argyll, Lord Carnarvon,\r\nand other men of distinction. The most touching communication was from\r\nthe venerated Earl of Shaftesbury, who had promised to attend, but was\r\nobliged to dictate a letter from a sick-bed, in which he expressed the\r\nsatisfaction he felt in having lived to see such changes in regard to\r\nslavery during the past fifty years. On the daïs behind the platform\r\nwere busts of Granville Sharp, and of Clarkson, decorated with flowers,\r\nand in front were exhibited massive wooden yokes and iron chains, such\r\nas are used for the gangs of slaves in the journey to the coast of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nWell might Lord Granville express his delight on \"looking at this\r\nassembly of eminent men in all the walks of life in this country, of\r\ndifferent professions, of different pursuits, of different religious\r\ndenominations, of different political parties, all absorbed by one\r\nphilanthropic idea, and presided over by the illustrious Prince, the\r\nHeir-Apparent to the Throne.\" How the Prince came to occupy this\r\nposition, it may interest many readers to know. Mr. Allen, the Secretary\r\nof the Society, and Mr. W. E. Forster, went to ask him to preside at the\r\nmeeting. Mr. Forster, for whom the Prince had high personal esteem,\r\nreminded him that his father had made his first public appearance as\r\nchairman of a meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society. The Prince did not\r\nneed to be reminded of this, but at once most cordially assented to\r\npreside from his own interest in the subject, and if Mr. Allen would\r\ngive a few necessary dates and facts he would do the best he could. With\r\nthis assurance the success of the meeting was secured.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor, according to civic custom, having taken the chair for an\r\ninstant, then vacated it, and invited His Royal Highness to preside over\r\nthe meeting. The Prince then rose, amidst enthusiastic cheers, and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--At the express wish of the\r\n    Lord Mayor I am asked to preside on this auspicious occasion. I\r\n    need hardly tell you that in such a cause it gives me more than\r\n    ordinary pleasure to occupy the chair at so great and\r\n    influential a meeting as this. I confess I had some reluctance\r\n    in presiding to-day, feeling that others could accomplish the\r\n    task far better than I should. But I also felt that possibly I\r\n    might have some slight claim to occupy the chair on such an\r\n    occasion, as so many members of my family have presided over\r\n    former meetings in connection with Anti-Slavery movements. In\r\n    the years 1825 and 1828, my uncle the late Duke of Gloucester\r\n    presided at meetings of the Society, which were numerously\r\n    attended. The Duke of Sussex did so in 1840; and you are well\r\n    aware of the interest they took in promoting the objects of the\r\n    Society by bringing forward questions concerning it in\r\n    Parliament. In the same year my lamented father occupied the\r\n    chair at a very large and crowded meeting at Exeter Hall; and I\r\n    believe that occasion was the very first on which he occupied\r\n    the chair at any public meeting in this country. Let me say that\r\n    my excuse for standing before you to-day may be given in words\r\n    used by him forty-four years ago. They were these--'I have been\r\n    induced to preside at the meeting of this Society from the\r\n    conviction of its paramount importance to the greatest interests\r\n    of humanity and justice.'\r\n\r\n    \"This is a great and important anniversary. To-day we celebrate\r\n    the jubilee of the emancipation of Slavery throughout our\r\n    colonies; and it is also a day which has been looked forward to\r\n    with pleasure and satisfaction by this excellent Society, which\r\n    has worked so hard in this great cause of humanity.\r\n\r\n    \"We may be all proud, ladies and gentlemen, that England was the\r\n    first country which abolished negro Slavery. Parliament voted,\r\n    and the nation paid, twenty million pounds to facilitate this\r\n    object. Our example was followed by many other countries, though\r\n    I regret to say that in Brazil and Cuba slavery still exists, as\r\n    well as in Mohammedan and heathen countries. It is a very\r\n    natural temptation that, in newly-peopled countries, and\r\n    especially when the climate prevents Europeans from working,\r\n    forced labour should be introduced. The Duke of Gloucester very\r\n    properly said that 'The Slave-trade can only be thoroughly\r\n    abolished by the abolition of Slavery; that while there is a\r\n    demand, there will be a supply; this is the keynote of the\r\n    Society during its existence.'\r\n\r\n    \"Principally owing to the indefatigable exertions of the\r\n    undaunted Thomas Clarkson and his great Parliamentary coadjutor,\r\n    William Wilberforce, the Slave-trade and the untold horrors of\r\n    the Middle Passage were, as far as Great Britain was concerned,\r\n    put an end to in the year 1807. The majority, therefore, of the\r\n    Slaves in the West Indian Islands who received the benefit of\r\n    the Emancipation Act were descendants of those Africans who had\r\n    been originally torn from the forests of Africa. Speaking of the\r\n    proclamation of the emancipation of the Slaves in the colonies,\r\n    Mr. Buxton said:--'Throughout the colonies the churches and\r\n    chapels had been thrown open, and the Slaves had crowded into\r\n    them on the evening of the 31st of July, 1834. As the hour of\r\n    midnight approached they fell upon their knees, and awaited the\r\n    solemn moment, all hushed, silent, and prepared. When twelve\r\n    o'clock sounded from the chapel bells they sprang upon their\r\n    feet, and through every island rang glad sounds of thanksgiving\r\n    to the Father of all, for the chains were broken and the Slaves\r\n    were free.'\r\n\r\n    \"I may mention that I have within a short time ago received a\r\n    telegram from the President of the Wesleyan Methodist Conference\r\n    in session at Burslem, congratulating me and you on the meeting\r\n    of to-day, and stating that it was during the session of the\r\n    Conference in 1834 that the abolition of Slavery in the West\r\n    Indian Colonies became an accomplished fact--a consummation for\r\n    which, as Wesleyan Methodists, they had universally prayed and\r\n    laboured. They cannot therefore, but profoundly rejoice at the\r\n    jubilee of the great event, with its incalculable benefits, not\r\n    only to the West Indies, but to all other peoples throughout the\r\n    world.\r\n\r\n    \"It may not, perhaps, be generally known to you that Slavery was\r\n    abolished in India in 1843 by the simple passing of an Act\r\n    destroying its legal status, and putting the freeman and Slave\r\n    on the same footing before the law. The natural result took\r\n    place, and millions of Slaves gratuitously procured their own\r\n    freedom without any sudden dislocation of the rights claimed by\r\n    their masters. A plan similar to this would be found a most\r\n    effectual one in Egypt and other Mohammedan countries. This\r\n    example was followed by Lord Carnarvon in 1874 on the Gold Coast\r\n    of Western Africa, where he was able to abolish Slavery without\r\n    any serious interference with the habits and customs of the\r\n    people. Under the influence of England, the Bey of Tunis issued\r\n    a decree in 1846, abolishing Slavery and the Slave-trade\r\n    throughout his dominions, which concluded in the following\r\n    simple and forcible terms:--'Know that all Slaves that shall\r\n    touch our territory by sea or by land shall become free.'\r\n\r\n    \"In connection with this there are two names which I cannot do\r\n    otherwise than allude to to-day--that of Sir Samuel Baker, and\r\n    one which is on everybody's lips--that of General Gordon. You\r\n    are well aware that during the term of five or six years that\r\n    they were governors of the Soudan their great object was to put\r\n    down the Slave-trade on the White Nile. They were successful to\r\n    a great extent, but I fear they had great difficulties to\r\n    contend with, and when their backs were turned much of the evil\r\n    came out again which they had found on their arrival.\r\n\r\n    \"I will now turn to Europe. The great Republic of France in\r\n    1848, under the guidance of the veteran Abolitionist M. Victor\r\n    Schoelcher and his colleagues, passed a short Act abolishing\r\n    Slavery throughout the French dominions: 'La République n'admet\r\n    plus d'esclaves sur le territoire Français.' In Russia the\r\n    emancipation of twenty millions of serfs in 1861 by the late\r\n    Emperor of Russia must not pass unchronicled in a review of the\r\n    history of emancipation, although, strictly speaking, this form\r\n    of Slavery can scarcely be classed with that resulting from the\r\n    African Slave-trade. In the United States of America in 1865 the\r\n    fetters of six millions of Slaves in the Southern States were\r\n    melted in the hot fires of the most terrible civil war of modern\r\n    times. Passing on to South America, and looking to Brazil, it\r\n    may be noted with satisfaction that all of the small republics\r\n    formerly under the rule of Spain put an end to Slavery at the\r\n    time they threw off the yoke of the mother country. The great\r\n    Empire of Brazil has alone, I regret to say, retained the curse\r\n    which she inherited from her Portuguese rulers. At the present\r\n    moment she possesses nearly a million and a half of Slaves on\r\n    her vast plantations, but arrangements are made for their\r\n    gradual emancipation.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, having taken this glance at the condition of Slavery\r\n    to-day, I will add, in the words of the Society, that 'the chief\r\n    object of this jubilee meeting is to rekindle the enthusiasm of\r\n    England, and to assist her to carry on this civilising torch of\r\n    freedom until its beneficent light shall be shed over all the\r\n    earth.' The place in which this meeting is held, the character\r\n    of this great meeting, and the reception these words have\r\n    received, assure me that I have not done wrong in stating freely\r\n    these objects. One of the objects of the Society is to circulate\r\n    at home and abroad accurate information on the enormities of the\r\n    Slave-trade and of Slavery, to give evidence--if evidence,\r\n    indeed, be wanting--to the inhabitants of Slave-holding\r\n    countries of the pecuniary advantages of free labour, and to\r\n    diffuse authentic information respecting the beneficial result\r\n    to the countries of emancipation. The late Duke of Gloucester,\r\n    in the course of a speech made by him in 1825, said that 'his\r\n    family had been brought to this country for the protection of\r\n    the rights and liberties of its subjects, and as a member of\r\n    that family he should not be discharging his duty towards them\r\n    if he did not recommend the sacred principles of freedom by\r\n    every means in his power.' Most heartily and most cordially do I\r\n    endorse his words.\r\n\r\n    \"I rejoice that we have on the platform the eminent sons of two\r\n    eminent fathers in the work of abolishing the Slave-trade and\r\n    Slavery. Lord Derby and Mr. Forster, whom I rejoice to see here,\r\n    have a hereditary connection with emancipation. The late Lord\r\n    Derby, then Mr. Stanley, was Colonial Secretary to the Liberal\r\n    Government of that day, which had set before it the task of\r\n    carrying through Parliament a measure which was to put a term to\r\n    Slavery in all the dependencies of the United Kingdom. Mr.\r\n    Forster's father, having taken his full share of the agitation\r\n    which led to the abolition of colonial Slavery, went to\r\n    Tennessee on an Anti-Slavery errand and died in that State.\r\n    There are glimpses, ladies and gentlemen, in Mr. Trevelyan's\r\n    'Life of Macaulay,' of the devotion with which this great\r\n    movement was carried on. Zachary Macaulay, father of our great\r\n    historian, was one of the chief workers in the cause, and it is\r\n    said of him that for forty years he was ever burdened with the\r\n    thought that he was called upon to wage war with this gigantic\r\n    evil. In some of the West India islands the apprenticeship\r\n    system produced worse evils than the servitude of the Slave. The\r\n    negroes were theoretically free, but practically Slaves. The\r\n    masters had been paid for their emancipation, but still held\r\n    them to service. In a year or two the term of apprenticeship was\r\n    shortened, and soon afterwards public opinion at home demanded\r\n    and effected its complete abolition. There were four years of\r\n    disappointment, trouble, dispute, and suffering in all the West\r\n    Indies, except the island of Antigua, where the planters had\r\n    preferred to make the change from Slavery to freedom at a single\r\n    step. Full emancipation of the colonies had to be enforced in\r\n    1838 by another Act, which abolished the transition stage, and\r\n    proclaimed universal and complete emancipation. This Act Only\r\n    completed the work which 1833 began. The battle in which so many\r\n    noble spirits had been engaged was practically won when the name\r\n    of Slavery was abolished. The negroes of the West Indies look\r\n    back to the 1st August, 1834, as the birthday of their race. The\r\n    Emancipation Act, which on that day came into force, spoke the\r\n    doom of Slavery all round the world.\r\n\r\n    \"I have ventured on this occasion to touch on different topics\r\n    and dates which I thought would be of interest, but it is not my\r\n    wish to weary you with longer details. Allow me to thank you for\r\n    the kind way in which you have listened to the remarks I have\r\n    made, and to assure you how deeply I am with you on this\r\n    occasion, both heart and soul.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no formal compliment when Earl Granville, who followed the\r\nPresident, said, that \"the illustrious Prince, following the example of\r\nhis noble father, and of other members of the Royal Family, not only\r\npresided on this occasion with dignity and grace, but had spoken with\r\nearnestness and power on this great question.\" He also paid a generous\r\ntribute to the memory of Lord Palmerston, under whom he had begun his\r\nown official life, and who had laboured long and zealously in the\r\nanti-slavery cause.\r\n\r\nThe speakers who succeeded, without exception, rose to the height of the\r\ngreat argument. Sir Stafford Northcote, the Lord Iddesleigh of after\r\nyears, closed his speech with a noble peroration: \"They had deep reason\r\nto be thankful for the position which England had been allowed to take\r\nin this great controversy. They knew what that great position was; they\r\nknew how it astonished the world, and how it astonished ourselves, that\r\nthis island had spread itself in its intentions and designs over so\r\nlarge a portion of the world's surface, and what responsibility it had\r\ntaken upon itself in consequence. This position had brought us into\r\ncommunication with every portion of the globe where Slavery prevailed.\r\nIt gave us great opportunities, and we must see that they are not\r\nneglected. England's mission was not to magnify herself and speak of the\r\ngreatness she had achieved: it was rather to look to the happiness and\r\nthe advancement of the world. There were lines written by a great poet\r\nwhich were originally applied to the great Empire of Rome, but which\r\nwere applicable to England. They spoke of that which became an Imperial\r\nrace, and of the aptitude of other nations for other arts and pursuits.\r\nIt was the Imperial position and the boast of England to release the\r\ncaptive, and set free the Slave; and, in the words of the poet to whom\r\nhe had referred, he would say: 'These are Imperial arts, and worthy\r\nthee.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury spoke of the duty of the clergy to promote\r\nand direct public feeling on this question. Lord Derby, then Foreign\r\nSecretary, in referring to direct action by England, said that\r\ninternational diplomacy set limits to carrying out all that they might\r\nwish in regard to foreign slavery. \"The English Act of 1834 had\r\npractically given the death-blow to slavery throughout the world. I do\r\nnot think this is saying too much, for we know the force of public\r\nopinion.\" He concluded by saying that \"the slave trade, although\r\nsomewhat checked, will never be thoroughly got rid of till Slavery dies\r\nout in Asia, and in partially civilized countries. How this is to be\r\neffected, when it can be done, and through what agencies, are questions\r\nnot to be settled by an off-hand sentence at a public meeting. But that\r\nit ought to be done--that it can be done, and that in time it will be\r\ndone--are matters about which I entertain no doubt; and, that being so,\r\nI have much pleasure in proposing this resolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution ran as follows:--\"That this meeting, while fully\r\nrecognising the great steps made by nearly all civilised nations in the\r\npath of human freedom, has yet to contemplate with feelings of the\r\ndeepest sorrow the vast extent of Slavery still maintained among\r\nMohammedan and heathen nations, producing, as its consequence, the\r\nindescribable horrors of the Central and East African Slave-trade, as\r\nfatal to human life on shore as the dreadful Middle Passage formerly was\r\nat sea; in view of this appalling state of things, this meeting pledges\r\nitself to support the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in its\r\nefforts to urge the Governments of all Slave-holding countries to put an\r\nend to Slavery as the only certain method of stopping the Slave-trade.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Forster said that this resolution had been drawn with a temperance\r\nof language which he feared he would not have been able to command. He\r\nthought that the services which England had rendered to some nations\r\nstill encouraging Slavery and the Slave-trade, entitled her voice to be\r\nraised with great authority. But he recognised the difficulties, which\r\nshould nerve them to greater earnestness in strengthening public opinion\r\nin this country on the subject. \"I greatly rejoice,\" said Mr. Forster,\r\n\"to see this meeting, and I believe this means a new departure, and a\r\ndetermination to carry on the work, and to strengthen the hands of this\r\nSociety for what it has yet to do.\"\r\n\r\nCardinal Manning, in an earnest and eloquent appeal, also urged the\r\nclaims of the Society. \"The reports published by it, as to the actual\r\nstate of Slavery and the Slave-trade, are too sadly true. We are told\r\nthat Livingstone, whose name cannot be mentioned in this hall or\r\nanywhere without awaking the sympathy of all Christian men, has left it\r\non record as his belief that half-a-million of human lives are annually\r\nsacrificed by this African Slave-trade. This horrible traffic runs in\r\nthree tracks, marked by skeletons, from the centre of Africa towards\r\nMadagascar, towards Zanzibar, and towards the Red Sea. Also, we are\r\ntold, that of those who are carried away by force, some are so worn by\r\nfatigue as to die, others falling by the way are slaughtered by the\r\nsword, so that of this great multitude only one-third ever reaches the\r\nend of their horrible destination. It would seem to me that never in the\r\nMiddle Passage was murder and misery so great.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was thus said by Cardinal Manning has been since confirmed by his\r\nEminence Cardinal Lavigerie, Archbishop of Algiers and Carthage, when\r\nrecently in London, engaged in a righteous crusade to be preached by him\r\nin all the Capitals of Europe. This African prelate, from his own\r\nknowledge, during the last thirty years, as missionary and as prelate,\r\ngave terrible details of the slave trade, as the curse of that dark\r\ncontinent. The Cardinal says that the traffic can never be stopped,\r\nexcept by force, and if the Governments of Europe cannot effect this, he\r\nadvocates a voluntary crusade of men, ready to form armed colonies of\r\nblacks to protect the missionaries of religion and civilization, and to\r\ndefend the slave regions from the murderous raiders who invade them. The\r\nsuccess of Emin Pasha who has for ten years kept the whole of his great\r\nEquatorial province free from the ravages of the slave-hunters shows\r\nwhat can be done. But for the shameful abandonment of Gordon at\r\nKhartoum, the slave trade would at this time have been almost at an end,\r\nand the grand desires of Livingstone for the peace and welfare of Africa\r\nwould have been accomplished. Let us hope that Cardinal Lavigerie's\r\nvisit may not be in vain so far as England is concerned. He came quietly\r\nand went quietly, only paying two visits after his public appearance at\r\nPrince's Hall, one to the Marquis of Salisbury, and the other to the\r\nPrince of Wales.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Guildhall, the loyal and hearty thanks of the meeting\r\nwere offered to His Royal Highness, on the motion of the Lord Mayor,\r\nseconded by Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, and carried by acclamation. The\r\nPrince, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am not likely to forget this important day, and most\r\n    sincerely do I hope that important results may accrue from it.\r\n    We have to-day celebrated the past, but we have the future to\r\n    look to, as many speakers have said, and I cannot do better than\r\n    agree with my right hon. friend on my left (Mr. Forster) that we\r\n    must act with caution. But with due caution, and with the advice\r\n    and good example which have been set, I feel sure that in time\r\n    all countries will follow in the footsteps of England. The best\r\n    chance of a complete abolition of Slavery will lie in\r\n    civilisation, in opening up those great countries, Asia and\r\n    Africa, many parts of which are now known to but few Europeans,\r\n    and in disseminating education. In time people will see that\r\n    they have derived no benefit from having Slaves, that the\r\n    freeman will do his work far better than the one who is forced\r\n    to labour. I mentioned, in first speaking, the names of many men\r\n    connected with the subject on which we have met to-day. I will\r\n    now add the name of one who was taken from us a few months ago,\r\n    and who always had the deepest interest in this Society--I\r\n    allude to the eminent and much regretted statesman, Sir Bartle\r\n    Frere. And on this occasion his widow, Lady Frere, has sent to\r\n    us these slave irons [pointing to the chains in front], which\r\n    were brought some years ago from Zanzibar by Sir Bartle Frere,\r\n    and you will, by looking at these implements of the slavers, be\r\n    convinced more, perhaps, than by anything else, of the cruelty\r\n    and hardships which slaves in this part of Africa had to\r\n    undergo. I will not detain you longer, but I must thank you once\r\n    more for the kind support you have given me to-day, and also\r\n    those gentlemen, many of them old and valued friends of my own,\r\n    who have addressed you in such eloquent and exhaustive\r\n    speeches.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince vacated the chair, which was then taken by the Lord Mayor,\r\nand His Royal Highness left, amid loud cheers. His Royal Highness\r\nafterwards graciously consented to become Patron of the British and\r\nForeign Anti-Slavery Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO IRELAND IN 1885.\r\n\r\n_April 9th-17th._\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventeen years had passed since the Prince and Princess of Wales had\r\nbeen in Ireland, and had been received with generous and loyal\r\nenthusiasm. It was feared by many that the spirit of loyalty in the\r\nIrish people had died away and could never be revived. The selfish and\r\ntreasonable agitators who had long stirred up hostile and disloyal\r\nfeelings were vexed and angry when they heard of another Royal visit.\r\nThey used every means that a malign ingenuity could suggest to repress\r\nthe generous impulses of the Irish race, and did all in their power to\r\nprepare for the Prince and Princess of Wales a reception different from\r\nthat which had been given on their former visits. When they found that\r\nthe mass of the people looked forward with joyful anticipation to the\r\ncoming of the Prince and Princess among them, they recommended, on the\r\npart of what they called the national party, to maintain a \"dignified\r\nneutrality,\" and to abstain from joining in the loyal demonstration with\r\nwhich it was evident the Royal visitors would be welcomed. The design\r\nproved a failure. From the moment of landing at Kingstown to the day of\r\ntheir departure, not in Dublin only, but in the progress through the\r\nsouth of Ireland, the feeling of disaffection and disloyalty was\r\noverborne by the spontaneous and hearty enthusiasm of the people.\r\n\r\nThe first manifestation of loyal feeling was displayed at Kingstown,\r\nwhen an address was presented by the Commissioners of the township. The\r\nreply of the Prince shows how the spirit of the address was\r\nappreciated:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Chairman and Town Commissioners of Kingstown,--It has given\r\n    me great pleasure to receive the address with which you have\r\n    greeted me on my first landing in Ireland after some absence\r\n    from your shores, and I am grateful to you for the welcome which\r\n    you have accorded to the Princess of Wales and myself. I value,\r\n    I can assure you, very highly the expression of loyalty and\r\n    attachment to the Crown which your address contains, and I will\r\n    not fail to communicate to the Queen the sentiments of loyalty\r\n    and of devotion which you express towards Her Majesty. Most\r\n    certainly do I hope that this may not be the last visit which we\r\n    shall pay to a country where we have always been welcomed by\r\n    kindness, and where the hospitality which we have invariably\r\n    received on all former occasions has left so many pleasant\r\n    recollections impressed on our minds.\"\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Dublin the first address was presented by the City\r\nReception Committee, the citizens having, with the hearty co-operation\r\nof all classes, undertaken to pay the common courtesies of welcome,\r\nwhich rightly should have been done, and on former occasions were done,\r\nby the Lord Mayor and Corporation. An address was at the same time\r\npresented by the Chamber of Commerce. To both addresses the Prince thus\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Martin, Mr. Guinness, and Gentlemen,--On behalf of the\r\n    Princess of Wales and myself, I thank you heartily for the\r\n    address you have read to me, and I am very grateful to the\r\n    citizens of Dublin who through you have welcomed me to their\r\n    city. It gives the Princess and myself much gratification once\r\n    more to visit a country where we have received so much kindness,\r\n    and I regret the length of the interval which has elapsed since\r\n    we last were in Ireland, and fully appreciate your sentiments of\r\n    loyalty to the Throne and Constitution, and I will take care to\r\n    communicate to the Queen your expressions of devotion and\r\n    attachment to Her Majesty. It will give me much pleasure to\r\n    renew my acquaintance with Dublin and see the results of the\r\n    civic and private enterprise to which you refer. The furtherance\r\n    of the welfare of all classes of the realm is an object which is\r\n    dear to me, and I trust that the efforts of the Commission of\r\n    which I am a member will tend to the improvement of the\r\n    dwellings of those who contribute by their labour to the\r\n    prosperity of our great towns, and will thus add to their public\r\n    utility as citizens as well as to their private and domestic\r\n    happiness. I hope to visit many parts of Ireland and see much of\r\n    the work, as well as share some of the amusements, of the Irish\r\n    people. The kindness with which you have greeted me encourages\r\n    me to look forward with pleasure to my visit to a country where\r\n    courtesy and hospitality have ever been the characteristics of\r\n    the people.\"\r\n\r\nOne passage in the address of the Chamber of Commerce the Prince did not\r\nrefer to, but it is of great importance. After the warm expressions of\r\nloyalty to the Throne and the Constitution, and of devotion to the Queen\r\nand the Royal Family, the address continued, \"We earnestly desire that\r\nyour present visit may be productive of so much pleasure to your Royal\r\nHighnesses that you may feel encouraged to honour Ireland hereafter by\r\nvisits of more frequent occurrence and of longer duration. We venture to\r\nassure you that it would be a great gratification to Her Majesty's loyal\r\nsubjects in Ireland if a permanent Royal residence should be established\r\nin our country, and if some members of the Royal Family should see fit\r\nto make their home among us for some part of every year.\" About the\r\npermanent Royal residence in Ireland, the Prince kept a judicious\r\nsilence, for it is a point which involves financial as well as political\r\nquestions. But the opinion of the best Irish, of all classes, may well\r\nbe considered, if the proposal is brought before Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe address of the Royal Dublin Society when the Royal party visited the\r\nAgricultural Show elicited another appropriate speech from the Prince.\r\nAfter acknowledging the expressions of loyalty to the Throne, and of\r\npersonal kindness in the welcome given, the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"The proceedings of your society have ever been a matter of deep\r\n    interest to me, as they were to my lamented father; and, having\r\n    been fortunate enough on many occasions to be a successful\r\n    exhibitor at agricultural shows, I am able to appreciate the\r\n    service rendered to agriculture generally, and to the rearing of\r\n    cattle and horses especially, by your labours. In your attitude\r\n    towards the geographical survey I rejoice to see a determination\r\n    which proves to me that the promotion of those objects which you\r\n    consider to be for the best interests of your country is\r\n    paramount in your minds. I most sincerely trust that success may\r\n    attend each and all of your important undertakings, for they\r\n    are designed to promote the prosperity of a people who, quick to\r\n    grapple with the difficulties of science and always ready to\r\n    take advantage of the benefits of commerce, are necessarily\r\n    dependent to a large extent on highly taught and scientific\r\n    agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the day the Prince went to see for himself the condition of\r\nsome of the poorest parts of the city. His kindly sympathetic, manners\r\ntowards the poor, and the minute acquaintance which he showed with the\r\nwhole subject of the housing of the labouring classes, in all the\r\ndetails of construction and sanitation, were the theme of universal\r\nsurprise and admiration. Of this inspection of the \"slums\" a reporter at\r\nthe time said, \"The visit of the Prince to these parts of the city was\r\nnot publicly announced. But the people were not long in discovering who\r\ntheir visitor was. He had come among them with his eldest son,\r\nunattended by any guard, and the event showed that his confidence was\r\nnot misplaced. Cheers and welcomes and every outward demonstration of\r\nloyal good feeling attended him along his whole course. It was a\r\nreception which had been well earned, and it will certainly not be the\r\nleast pleasant recollection which the Prince will carry back when his\r\nIrish visit is at an end.\"\r\n\r\nThe proceedings on the 10th of April were as many and as laborious as\r\nthose of the preceding day. The first duty was the reception of\r\naddresses from various public bodies. There were no fewer than thirty\r\ndifferent addresses, presented by deputations of five persons for each.\r\nThey were received by the Prince, who wore the Order of St. Patrick. The\r\nPrincess of Wales was on his left, and Prince Albert Victor on her left.\r\nAll the addresses were handed in succession to the Prince, without being\r\nread, which would have occupied too much time, and then the deputations\r\nwere requested to approach the daïs, when the Prince, in dear expressive\r\ntones, read the following reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Graces, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I have thought it more\r\n    for your convenience, as well as more within the compass of my\r\n    ability, that I should, with your permission, make a general\r\n    reply to the many kind addresses with which you have honoured\r\n    me, and copies of which have already by your courtesy been\r\n    before me, than that I should attempt a separate reply to each.\r\n    I feel myself highly honoured by having been welcomed in this\r\n    historic hall by so many bodies representing so many and so\r\n    varied interests as you do. Leaders of local administrations,\r\n    heads of religious communities, representatives of learning and\r\n    art, philanthropy and education, you have one and all greeted me\r\n    with the kindness and good will which has made a deep\r\n    impression upon me, and which I never shall forget. You have\r\n    alluded in terms of loyalty, which have much gratified me, to\r\n    your attachment to the Constitution, and have expressed in a\r\n    manner which I will not fail to communicate to the Queen your\r\n    devotion to Her Majesty.\r\n\r\n    \"In varied capacities, and by widely different paths, you pursue\r\n    those great objects which, dear to you, are, believe me, dear\r\n    also to me--the prosperity and progress of Ireland, the welfare\r\n    and happiness of her people. That many difficulties from time to\r\n    time impede you I can well understand. Such is the natural\r\n    course of events. But I am glad to be able to gather from your\r\n    addresses that you are advancing steadily towards the goal which\r\n    you have in view. From my heart I wish you success, and I would\r\n    that time and my own powers would permit me to explain fully and\r\n    in detail the deep interest which I feel not only in the welfare\r\n    of this great Empire at large, but in the true happiness of\r\n    those several classes of the community on whose behalf you have\r\n    come here to-day. You have referred to the Princess of Wales,\r\n    who has accompanied me on this occasion, and for her I thank you\r\n    for your welcome to a country, of the past visits to which we\r\n    have pleasant recollections, and where we hope in future, as we\r\n    have in the past, to spend happy days.\"\r\n\r\nThe several deputations listened with great interest to the reply, and\r\nat the close gave expression to their pleasure in cordial acclamations.\r\n\r\nThe next event set down in the programme of the day was one to which\r\ngreat national importance is attached--namely, that of laying the\r\nfoundation stone of the new Museum of Science and Art in connection with\r\nSouth Kensington. Elaborate preparations had been made for it, and the\r\ngrounds at each side of Leinster House, which is to be the central\r\nbuilding, were adorned with gay flags and fitted up with stands, from\r\nwhich the entry of the Royal party and the ceremonial itself could be\r\nseen. A guard of honour, contributed by the Cornwall Regiment, with\r\ntheir band, was stationed on Leinster Lawn, opening upon Merrion Square,\r\nthrough which the Royal party entered. On the route from the Castle to\r\nLeinster House, the streets were everywhere densely crowded, and the\r\nhouses decorated. An open passage for the procession was kept by the\r\npolice without any difficulty, the populace behaving with exemplary\r\ndecorum. The Prince and Princess acknowledged most graciously the\r\nenthusiastic greetings of the crowds, which were largely composed of the\r\nworking classes. The first stone having been duly laid, and a statement\r\nhaving been made by Professor Ball of the objects of the new \"Museum of\r\nScience and Art, and of the National Library of Ireland,\" the Prince\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Ball, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I thank you heartily on\r\n    behalf of the Princess of Wales and myself for the very cordial\r\n    welcome which you leave given us to-day. It is peculiarly\r\n    satisfactory to me to have been able to take part in the\r\n    interesting ceremony of laying the foundation stone upon which\r\n    the superstructure of the new museum will, I hope, before long\r\n    be built. It gratified me to learn of the action which the\r\n    Science and Art Department had taken in reference to this museum\r\n    and to observe the support which that action received both from\r\n    the Royal Dublin Society and from the Royal Irish Academy. It is\r\n    by a united movement such as this that difficulties are overcome\r\n    and success made possible of attainment. I am glad to think that\r\n    the two great societies I have named have combined to smooth the\r\n    way for an institute which will, I trust, be useful to a large\r\n    number of the people of Ireland. I hope some day to see in full\r\n    working order the institution of which the first stone has been\r\n    laid this afternoon. When this is so, the magnificent\r\n    collections, which have obtained a wide reputation, will be open\r\n    to a public thoroughly capable of appreciating their merit and\r\n    deriving advantages from their amalgamation under one roof. The\r\n    Museum will worthily face the great library, where the efforts\r\n    of a State Department have been successfully combined with a\r\n    movement originated by the the citizens, and supported out of\r\n    the rates, the object of which is to give free facilities for\r\n    reading and study to the people of this metropolis. I am glad to\r\n    have been assisted to-day by the councils of the great societies\r\n    to which I have referred. To them, as well as to the visitors of\r\n    the Museum, and the trustees of the National Library, I offer my\r\n    warm thanks for the kindness of their reception, as well as for\r\n    the opportunity they have given me for sharing in a movement\r\n    calculated to make Leinster House even more worthy than\r\n    heretofore of the pride of the Irish nation, and the admiration\r\n    of literary and scientific bodies throughout the world.\"\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Leinster House the Royal and Viceregal parties drove\r\nto the Royal University, where another interesting ceremony was\r\nperformed. The hall of the University was crowded with a brilliant\r\nconcourse of graduates and spectators. Their Royal Highnesses and the\r\nLord Lieutenant and Countess Spencer were met by the Chancellor, the\r\nDuke of Abercorn, and the Vice-Chancellor, Lord Emly. After their Royal\r\nHighnesses had robed they were conducted to the hall. After all had\r\ntaken their seats in the hall, a formal announcement was made by Dr.\r\nMeredith that the Senate had resolved to confer the degree of Doctor of\r\nLaws _honoris causâ_ upon His Royal Highness Albert Edward Prince of\r\nWales, and also the degree of Doctor of Music _honoris causâ_ upon Her\r\nRoyal Highness Alexandra Princess of Wales, and that their Royal\r\nHighnesses had been graciously pleased to intimate that they would\r\naccept those degrees. The announcement was received with loud applause\r\nby the assembly. The Chancellor then read and presented an address to\r\nthe Prince, offering a respectful welcome and homage to His Royal\r\nHighness and his august consort. It also referred to the success of the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nThe degrees having been conferred, the Prince rose and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Duke, my Lords, and Gentlemen of the Senate of the\r\n    Royal University,--I am very grateful to you for the manner in\r\n    which you have received us in this hall, and on behalf of the\r\n    Princess of Wales and myself I thank you for the kind welcome\r\n    with which you have greeted us. The higher education of the\r\n    people is a subject in which I learnt from my lamented father to\r\n    take a great interest. It is a question to the solution of which\r\n    your labours, I am happy to think, have contributed much. Though\r\n    no considerable time has elapsed since the foundation of the\r\n    Royal University, it has already had a marked effect among those\r\n    people of this country who are especially open to the influence\r\n    of a University career. I shall value the degree which you have\r\n    conferred upon me, and I am proud to rank myself among the\r\n    graduates of a University, the advantages of which I am happy to\r\n    hear from you that all classes of the community avail themselves\r\n    of.\r\n\r\n    \"By the admission of women to your degrees you have supported\r\n    the view that the gentler sex are capable, not only of severe\r\n    competition in science, but of enjoying the benefits and using\r\n    the power which a well-considered scientific education bestows.\r\n    It gratified me to learn that you were willing to confer upon\r\n    the Princess of Wales the degree of Doctor of Music, which, Her\r\n    Royal Highness wishes me to state on her behalf, she has\r\n    received with pleasure not only because she felt that it was an\r\n    honour to herself, but because she wished to show her approval\r\n    of her action of the ladies of Ireland in accepting the\r\n    facilities and advantages which you have offered to them. In Her\r\n    Royal Highness's name and in my own, I thank you for the honour\r\n    you have done me, and for the kindness with which you have\r\n    received us to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince's speech was received with great cheering. The proceedings\r\nconcluded with the National Anthem. The Royal and Viceregal parties\r\nreturned to Dublin Castle amid renewed greetings from the citizens who\r\nstill waited in the streets to see them.\r\n\r\nSome of the incidents of the Royal visit must be passed over with simple\r\nmention, the Levée held by the Prince, the Drawing-room held by the\r\nPrincess, and the State Ball given by the Lord Lieutenant, of which it\r\nwas said at the time that \"no scene so animated and attractive has been\r\nwitnessed in Dublin Castle since the former visit of their Royal\r\nHighnesses to Ireland.\" The opening of the new dock at the extremity of\r\nthe North Wall attested the progress that has been made in the Port of\r\nDublin, accommodation being now provided for shipping of the largest\r\nclass. The Prince congratulated the \"Port and Docks Board\" on the\r\ncompletion of this work, and the Princess performed the ceremony of\r\nopening and christening the new basin, which is called the Alexandra\r\nBasin in commemoration of the event.\r\n\r\nThis took place on Saturday, the 11th of April. On the same day the\r\nRoyal visitors inspected the Artane Industrial School, with its\r\nworkshops and farms, and its probationary institution for the very\r\nyoung, a truly beneficent work carried on by the Christian Brothers. The\r\nArtane institution is one of the best of its class. The Government\r\ncontribute 5_s._ a week for each boy trained there, the rest of the cost\r\nbeing provided by charitable donations, and the profits of the\r\nworkshops.\r\n\r\nHaving described the visit to the Royal University, that to Trinity\r\nCollege must not be omitted. The reception was one of most enthusiastic\r\nloyalty. In the hall a vast assembly awaited the entrance of their Royal\r\nHighnesses, consisting of the members of the Senate, Fellows,\r\nProfessors, and invited visitors. An address was read by the\r\nVice-Chancellor, in which reference was made to the former visit of the\r\nPrince, when his name was enrolled among those of adopted sons of the\r\n_alma mater_. The Prince made appropriate reply for himself and for the\r\nPrincess, and at the close of his speech asked the Provost, Dr. Jellett,\r\nto grant the undergraduates a term. \"I cannot,\" added the Prince, \"ask\r\nfor the degree examination, but perhaps you will grant the college\r\nexamination.\" To the request so graciously made, the Provost said that\r\nthe Board of Trinity College acceded. The cheers from the undergraduates\r\nas the Royal visitors passed into the hall had been enthusiastic, and\r\nwere if possible more fervent as they left the College.\r\n\r\nThe last function performed by the Prince before leaving Dublin was\r\npresenting new colours to the Cornwall Regiment, then in garrison at\r\nDublin. The ceremony took place in the Castle Gardens. The corps\r\nmustered 800 strong, under Colonel Stabb, the commanding officer. The\r\nPrince wore his Field Marshal's uniform, and his son that of the Norfolk\r\nArtillery Volunteers. The usual routine on such occasions was followed,\r\nafter which the Prince addressed the regiment which had formed up close\r\naround the group of officers among whom he stood.\r\n\r\n    \"Colonel Stabb, Officers, Non-commissioned Officers, and Men of\r\n    the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry,--I consider it a high\r\n    honour to be permitted to present new colours to such a\r\n    distinguished regiment as that under your command--one which\r\n    ever since it was raised in 1704 has had as brilliant a record\r\n    of services in the field as any regiment in Her Majesty's\r\n    service. You first served with the great Duke of Marlborough in\r\n    Flanders, and then in America. Dettingen is the first name\r\n    inscribed on your colours. In the great Peninsular War you\r\n    especially distinguished yourselves, and suffered heavy losses\r\n    at Corunna and Salamanca. At Quatre Bras and Waterloo you lost\r\n    more than any other corps engaged, and the gallant Sir Thomas\r\n    Picton was killed at the head of your regiment. Your next\r\n    service was in India, where you took part in the Punjab\r\n    campaign. Later, in 1857, you gallantly distinguished yourselves\r\n    in the suppression of the Indian Mutiny, and gallantly held the\r\n    Residency of Lucknow during its defence from June till November.\r\n    You were on that occasion commanded by Brigadier-General Inglis,\r\n    who for those services was created a Major-General and a Knight\r\n    Commander of the Bath, while you received the honour of being\r\n    made Light Infantry. You, Colonel Stabb, are, I believe, the\r\n    only officer of the regiment present who served during the\r\n    Mutiny. When some years ago I visited the remains of the\r\n    Residency of Lucknow, my attention was especially called to the\r\n    services of this regiment. On your return the Queen and my\r\n    father inspected the regiment and personally thanked the\r\n    officers, non-commissioned officers and men for their gallant\r\n    conduct at Lucknow, and I feel doubly proud as their son to\r\n    have the honour of presenting these new colours to you to-day.\r\n    The latest records on your colours are Egypt and Tel-el-Kebir. A\r\n    second battalion, at this moment serving in the Soudan, has\r\n    recently been added to you, which, with the Royal Cornwall\r\n    Rangers Militia, of which I am the honorary Colonel, and the two\r\n    Volunteer battalions, make up the Duke of Cornwall's Light\r\n    Infantry. From the title I bear I am simply proud to be thus\r\n    connected with this fine regiment. In confiding these colours to\r\n    your care I feel that the honour of your Sovereign and your\r\n    country will ever be before you as on former occasions, and that\r\n    in the future, as in the past, the roll of honourable\r\n    distinction of your colours will ever increase.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Stabb, in the name of all the officers and men of the regiment,\r\nthanked His Royal Highness for the great honour he had done them in\r\npresenting the colours, and said he could not do better than express a\r\nfervent hope, which he did with a great deal of confidence, that the\r\nregiment would as faithfully defend the new colours as they did their\r\ncolours at Waterloo and Lucknow. He was sure the honour would be\r\nappreciated by the battalions of the regiment, and he tendered to His\r\nRoyal Highness their grateful thanks.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 13th the Prince and Princess started from the\r\nKingsbridge Station for Cork. At Mallow there were signs that the visit\r\nto the South might not be without unpleasant incidents. A loyal address\r\nwas presented at the station, but Mr. O'Brien and other Home Rule\r\nleaders had brought a number of Nationalists with bands, to disturb the\r\nunanimity of welcome. The rioters had to be ejected by the Constabulary.\r\nAt Cork there were similar attempts at hostile demonstration, but it was\r\nshown only by the lowest rabble, and at the instigation of the political\r\nagitators. The patriots of the present time are of immeasurably lower\r\ntype than Daniel O'Connell, even when he was most zealous for Repeal of\r\nthe Union. He was always loyal as well as patriotic, and however bitter\r\nin words, he was always a gentleman in his actions. Whatever may be the\r\nviews as to politics, the men who could incite their followers to insult\r\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales, whose hearts are full of sympathy and\r\nlove for Ireland, are unworthy the name of Irishmen. At Cork, several of\r\nthe Home Rule members urged the people to resent the visit of the Royal\r\nparty as a degradation to their city. At Dundalk on the same day, Mr.\r\nRedmond, M.P., addressing a meeting of the National League, \"expressed\r\nhis joy at the difficulty of England with the Soudan and Afghanistan. He\r\nhoped that the Russian bear would soon stick his claw into the British\r\nlion. He was sorry that this Prince of Wales was not there to see what\r\nthe real feeling of the Irish people was, instead of scampering about\r\nthe country attended by military and police and bloody Earl Spencer.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of a few jarring notes of this kind, the reception of the\r\nPrince and Princess in Ireland was worthy of the warm and hospitable\r\ncharacter of the Irish Nation. Another proof was given that the\r\ndisaffection is only temporary and partial, and due to the malignant\r\ninfluence of those who delude the ignorant with false representations.\r\nNo one understands this better than the Prince of Wales, than whom the\r\npeople of Ireland have no truer friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DARWIN MEMORIAL.\r\n\r\n_June 9th, 1885._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs one of the Trustees of the British Museum, the Prince of Wales was\r\nrequested to represent them on the occasion of the unveiling of the\r\nstatue of Charles Darwin, in the entrance-hall of the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, now at South Kensington. The ceremony of unveiling was\r\nperformed by Professor Huxley, whose address, after brief reference to\r\nthe high claims of the author of 'The Origin of Species,' and other\r\nworks of enduring fame, gave a statement as to the history of the\r\nmemorial statue. Then addressing the Prince as representing the\r\nTrustees, he was requested to accept the statue from the Darwin Memorial\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I consider it to be a high privilege to have been deputed by\r\n    the unanimous wish of my colleagues, the Trustees of the British\r\n    Museum, to accept, in their names, the gift which you have\r\n    offered us on behalf of the Committee of the Darwin Memorial.\r\n    The Committee and subscribers may rest assured that we have most\r\n    willingly assigned this honourable place to the statue of the\r\n    great Englishman who has exerted so vast an influence upon the\r\n    progress of those branches of natural knowledge, the advancement\r\n    of which is the object of the vast collection gathered here. It\r\n    has given me much pleasure to learn that the memorial has\r\n    received so much support in foreign countries, and it may be\r\n    regarded as cosmopolitan rather than merely national; while the\r\n    fact that persons of every condition of life have contributed to\r\n    it affords remarkable evidence of the popular interest in the\r\n    discussion of scientific problems. A memorial to which all\r\n    nations and all classes of society have contributed cannot be\r\n    more fitly lodged than in our Museum, which though national is\r\n    open to all the world, and the resources of which are at the\r\n    disposal of every student of Nature, whatever his condition or\r\n    his country, who enters our doors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIRKBECK INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n_July 4th, 1885._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis institution was founded in 1825, by Dr. Birkbeck, a zealous\r\neducationist of that time, for promoting learning, chiefly among the\r\nmiddle and working classes, by opening evening classes, and establishing\r\nlectures and other means of instruction. The old building having become\r\ninsufficient in its accommodation, a new edifice was erected near\r\nChancery Lane, of which the foundation stone was laid, in 1883, by the\r\nlate Duke of Albany. To open this new building the Prince and Princess\r\nof Wales came, on the 4th of July, 1885.\r\n\r\nA loyal address having been presented by Mr. Birkbeck, M.P., one of the\r\ntrustees, the Prince thus replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you for the loyal address which you have presented to\r\n    me, and would express the heartfelt satisfaction which I\r\n    experience in visiting an institution with which my lamented\r\n    brother's name will ever be associated. You have referred to his\r\n    touching words when laying the foundation stone of this\r\n    building, and I am reminded that on that memorable occasion he\r\n    stated that he had lent his aid to an enterprise on the\r\n    accomplishment of which he would be able to look back with\r\n    feelings of satisfaction and pride! It was not permitted to him\r\n    to see this noble structure in its finished state, but I rejoice\r\n    to know that prior to the great calamity which befell us he had\r\n    received an intimation that the building was approaching\r\n    completion.\r\n\r\n    \"I observe with pleasure the names of the distinguished\r\n    contributors to the building fund, and I rejoice that the Queen\r\n    has shown her interest in an institution which met with the warm\r\n    support of my revered father. Sixty years ago the Duke of Sussex\r\n    performed the inaugural ceremony of your old building; and it\r\n    speaks much for the vitality of your institution that after so\r\n    lengthened a period a member of my family should be again\r\n    invited to declare a building open so extensive as this one, the\r\n    erection of which has been absolutely demanded by the expansion\r\n    of your work. An institution in which provision is made for 6000\r\n    students, and to which both sexes are invited, must exert a very\r\n    beneficial influence on the young men and women of the\r\n    Metropolis, for whose mental advancement it has been erected.\r\n    Many of the students in the old building have worthily\r\n    distinguished themselves, and it behoves those who partake of\r\n    the greater advantages of the new institution to emulate the\r\n    noble examples which have been set by their predecessors.\r\n\r\n    \"The movement initiated by Dr. George Birkbeck was a very\r\n    remarkable one, and the foundation of the old institution was an\r\n    event of historic importance. We are informed that this movement\r\n    has spread not only throughout the Kingdom, but that its\r\n    ramifications have extended to different parts of the world, and\r\n    the presence to-day of representatives of our Colonies is to me\r\n    one of the most interesting features of the proceedings. The\r\n    success of Dr. Birkbeck's work is to be traced in the fact that,\r\n    in the words of Professor Tyndall, 'it responded at the proper\r\n    time to a national need, and to a need of human nature.'\r\n\r\n    \"This institution has anticipated some of the beneficent\r\n    movements of the age, and by its technical instruction, and the\r\n    admission of both sexes to its advantages, has exerted a very\r\n    powerful influence for good. With a vitality so potent we may\r\n    look forward to the time when even this extensive building will\r\n    be insufficient for your needs. It is a subject for\r\n    congratulation that the institutions which by the establishment\r\n    of the Birkbeck Institution have been called into existence are\r\n    being so wisely adapted to the requirements of the age, and are\r\n    exerting by their development such a beneficent influence among\r\n    the people at large. I desire to thank you most heartily for the\r\n    kind welcome you have given us here this afternoon, and I\r\n    earnestly hope that this great institution will continue to\r\n    flourish, and that we may hear from time to time of its\r\n    increasing prosperity.\r\n\r\n    \"This building, which will be regarded as a memorial of my dear\r\n    brother's devotion to the great cause of education, I have now\r\n    the gratification to declare open, and, in his words, 'to\r\n    dedicate it to those noble uses which it is intended to serve.'\"\r\n\r\nThe thanks of the audience to the Prince were proposed by the Lord\r\nMayor, and seconded by Sir Charles Tupper, High Commissioner for Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY GUARDS' FRIENDLY SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n_July 5th, 1884._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the ninth triennial festival of the Railway Guards' Universal\r\nFriendly Society, held at Willis's Rooms, July 5th, 1884, the Prince of\r\nWales presided. A large number of directors and leading men connected\r\nwith the railway companies were among the company. In giving or\r\nresponding to the usual loyal toasts, His Royal Highness, in a very\r\ngrateful and gracious way, took the opportunity of expressing his warm\r\nsense of the uniform attention shown to the Queen, and also to himself\r\nand the Princess of Wales, during their very frequent journeys, by the\r\ndirectors and all the officials and servants of the various railway\r\ncompanies. Everything was done for their safety and comfort, and he\r\nwished thus publicly to acknowledge his appreciation of what was done.\r\n\r\nIn giving the toast of the evening, \"Prosperity to the Railway Guards'\r\nUniversal Friendly Society,\" the Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"We are to-day celebrating the ninth triennial festival of this\r\n    Society, in aid of the 'Permanent Sick and Injured, and Widows\r\n    and Orphans' Fund,' and I think all will agree with me that\r\n    there is no charity which better deserves the attention and\r\n    support of the public than this one. That it has already\r\n    received such support is apparent to us from the length of time\r\n    it has existed, but like all other great institutions of the\r\n    kind in our country, the money which is required is, also,\r\n    greatly in excess of that which is at their disposal to meet the\r\n    actual necessities which arise.\r\n\r\n    \"No public servants, I think, more deserve our sincere sympathy\r\n    and support than the guards of our railway trains. It is obvious\r\n    to all of us who have to travel constantly on railways how much\r\n    our safety depends on their industry, their vigilance, their\r\n    sobriety, and their discipline; and it is very gratifying to\r\n    know that we may confidently rely on finding these qualities in\r\n    them. Knowing what they have to go through, their exposure to\r\n    all weathers and to risks of all kinds; remembering how much\r\n    they have to be away from their homes and their families, it\r\n    seems to me that we have hardly the right to expect to obtain\r\n    from them their valuable services unless we in some measure\r\n    mitigate their sufferings in sickness and from accident, and\r\n    unless in case of death we do something for the maintenance of\r\n    their widows and orphans. The Society was founded in June, 1849,\r\n    and is one of the oldest societies in existence designed for the\r\n    benefit of railway _employés_, and may be said to represent\r\n    every line in the United Kingdom. It consists of forty-eight\r\n    districts at the present time, situated at the principal railway\r\n    stations throughout the country, from London to Inverness. In\r\n    addition to the usual advantages offered by friendly\r\n    societies--the ordinary sick and death benefits--this society\r\n    possesses two special features adapted to the requirements of\r\n    railway guards, who are exposed to very great risks from\r\n    accidents. These objects are: 1st, a liberal provision for life\r\n    for all those members who may become permanently disabled,\r\n    either from injuries or constitutional causes; 2nd, annuities\r\n    for the widows and orphans of deceased members. Other\r\n    institutions, if they attempt to provide these exceptional\r\n    benefits, only do so to a limited extent, and the members to\r\n    whom they are granted are elected as vacancies occur; but the\r\n    policy of this society has always been to provide these great\r\n    blessings for all who are so unfortunate as to require them;\r\n    and, notwithstanding that statistics show that guards run\r\n    greater risks than other classes of railway servants, the\r\n    contributions of the members themselves have been so largely\r\n    supplemented by the generous support accorded by the public\r\n    generally, that the society up to the present time has been able\r\n    to carry out this fundamental principle.\"\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the speech of His Royal Highness consisted of\r\nstatistics of a most interesting kind, both as to the vast extent of\r\nrailway travelling, the number of trains, of passengers, of railway\r\n_employés_, at that time numbering 357,650. All these statistics, as\r\nobtained from the returns of the Board of Trade, and also the number of\r\npersons killed or injured, especially those employed on the lines, were\r\npresented with admirable clearness to the audience, and were heard with\r\ngreat interest; but the statistics are not the same now, and are\r\ntherefore not here given. The Prince concluded with an earnest appeal\r\nfor help to the institution for which he pleaded. The appeal was\r\nliberally responded to, the subscriptions amounting to £3383, including\r\na hundred guineas from the Royal Chairman, which has been his generous\r\ncustom at the close of most of the charitable meetings for objects which\r\nhave had the advantage of his support and advocacy.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be added that the Prince had already presided at a festival\r\nof the \"Railway Benevolent Association,\" where he spoke with equal\r\nwarmth and sympathy for all classes of railway servants. There are now\r\nother institutions with similar objects, partly provident and partly\r\nbenevolent, and it is an excellent kind of charity. The directors of\r\ncompanies do their part, and, where there is any just cause, can be made\r\nto do more, under the Employers' Liability Act. For unavoidable\r\naccidents the men themselves contribute their money, on the principle of\r\nmutual insurance, but there is need also for more of the benevolent\r\ngifts of those who travel by rail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVALESCENT HOME AT SWANLEY.\r\n\r\n_July 13th, 1885._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of July, 1872, the Prince of Wales, as President of St.\r\nBartholomew's Hospital, formally opened a new Convalescent Home, in\r\nconnection with that Hospital. This was an institution much needed at\r\nthe time, and its advantages had long been urged on the Governors by Mr.\r\nFoster White, the Treasurer. At several existing Homes, such as at\r\nWalton-on-Thames, and Bognor, patients from St. Bartholomew's had been\r\nreceived, but it was desirable to have an establishment of its own, and\r\nconducted by its own officers. The carrying out of this scheme would\r\nrequire large expenditure, and a suitable building could not be provided\r\nfor a considerable time. A temporary home was obtained at Highgate,\r\nthrough the generous munificence of Sir Sydney Waterlow, one of the\r\nGovernors of the Hospital. He presented as a free gift the lease, for\r\nseveral years, of Lauderdale House, a mansion with many historical\r\nassociations, somewhat old, but with every convenience for use as a\r\ntemporary home for convalescent patients, and so it continued for\r\nthirteen years. On the 13th of July, 1885, the Prince, accompanied by\r\nthe Princess of Wales, and the Princesses Louise, Victoria, and Maude,\r\nvisited Swanley, in Kent, to open the permanent Home, erected through\r\nthe generosity of Mr. Charles T. Kettlewell, one of the Governors of the\r\nHospital. It is a spacious building, with accommodation for forty-five\r\nmale and twenty-five female patients, standing in the middle of\r\nbeautiful grounds, comprising an area of fifteen acres.\r\n\r\nTheir Royal Highnesses having taken their places on the daïs at the end\r\nof a tent, Sir Sydney Waterlow, who had for several years given the use\r\nof Lauderdale House at Highgate, read an address, which gave a summary\r\nof the facts relating to the new institution. Besides the gift of\r\n£15,000 by Mr. Kettlewell for the building, an anonymous donor, a\r\ngovernor of the Hospital, contributed £500 for the site; Mr. Homan,\r\nanother governor, and Mrs. Homan had built a chapel and provided its\r\nfurniture and communion plate; and Sir James Tyler had given an organ to\r\nthe chapel, and built the lodge at the entrance of the grounds.\r\n\r\nSir Sydney having finished his address, the Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Sydney Waterlow, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--You have given us\r\n    a most interesting account of the history of the institution you\r\n    wish me to open. I can only say on behalf of the Princess of\r\n    Wales and myself that we are extremely happy to have an\r\n    opportunity of assisting at the inauguration of an institution\r\n    such as this, where the patients ought to feel very grateful for\r\n    the manner in which every plan for their comfort has been\r\n    carried out through the munificence of Mr. Kettlewell. Nothing\r\n    can be of greater importance than that convalescent homes such\r\n    as this should exist, especially in connection with large\r\n    hospitals such as St. Bartholomew's. The spot now chosen, with\r\n    its healthy aspect and beautiful scenery, will, I am sure, meet\r\n    all requirements. It affords me great pleasure to be here\r\n    to-day, and I feel proud to be the president of such an\r\n    institution as St. Bartholomew's, and to be able to assist Sir\r\n    Sydney Waterlow, who takes such interest in, and devotes so much\r\n    of his time and energies to, the prosperity of the hospital. I\r\n    have great satisfaction in declaring the home to be now open.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremony over, the Rev. S. Kettlewell, who had offered the\r\ndedicatory prayer, and his son, Mr. C. T. Kettlewell, donor of the\r\nbuilding, were presented to the Prince of Wales by Sir Sydney Waterlow.\r\nBefore leaving, the Royal party visited the home, and also inspected the\r\nadjacent laundry buildings which have been erected for use as a washing\r\nestablishment for St. Bartholomew's Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YORKSHIRE COLLEGE AT LEEDS.\r\n\r\n_July 15th, 1885._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yorkshire College at Leeds is one of the most important and useful\r\nof the educational institutions that have in recent times been\r\nestablished. Commencing in 1874 on a comparatively small scale, it has\r\ngradually grown to be a great school, not for technical and scientific\r\ntraining only, but for all departments of study. The staff of the\r\nCollege includes professors of mathematics, physics, chemistry,\r\nengineering, and various branches of industrial teaching; and also of\r\nclassics, history, and modern literature, and languages. The celebrated\r\nLeeds School of Medicine has been affiliated to the College. For special\r\ndepartments of practical instruction provision has been made, the\r\nClothworkers' Company of London undertaking to support that which\r\npertains to textile industries, and the Drapers' Company that of\r\ncolliery management and mining engineering. Workshops, laboratories,\r\nlecture rooms, and other premises, are connected with the College, the\r\nbuildings of which were designed by Sir Alfred Waterhouse, and commenced\r\nin 1877, when the foundation stone was laid by the Archbishop of York.\r\nThe friends of the College have contributed not less than £200,000 to\r\nbring it to its present condition. To inaugurate this great institution\r\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales visited Leeds on the 15th of July,\r\n1885.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Leeds from Studley, the seat of Lord Ripon, their Royal\r\nHighnesses were received by the Mayor and Corporation, and conducted to\r\nthe Town Hall, which was opened by the Queen and the Prince Consort in\r\n1858. An address being read by the Town Clerk, the Prince replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--I receive with the greatest pleasure\r\n    the address which you have just presented to me, and the\r\n    Princess of Wales joins me in thanking you most sincerely for\r\n    your kind words of welcome. Coming from the civic authorities of\r\n    one of our greatest industrial centres these expressions are a\r\n    proof, if any were required, that the population of this country\r\n    remains true in its appreciation of the value of our\r\n    time-honoured institutions, in devotion to the Queen, and in\r\n    attachment to the Royal Family. I rejoice to learn from your\r\n    address that the visits of the members of my family at various\r\n    times to this great city have been attended with beneficial\r\n    results, and have contributed in some degree to its welfare and\r\n    prosperity, and to the development of the many useful\r\n    institutions for which Leeds is so justly famous. Although it\r\n    has pleased the Almighty to remove some of my dearest and most\r\n    gifted relations from the scene of their labours, I can assure\r\n    you that their survivors will always be ready to encourage by\r\n    their presence and assistance the foundation and advancement of\r\n    such institutions as the one which we are brought together\r\n    to-day to inaugurate. It will be a source of sincere\r\n    gratification to me to convey to the Queen your expressions of\r\n    loyal devotion, and I can assure you that they will be highly\r\n    appreciated by Her Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nAn address from the Leeds Masonic lodges was also received and responded\r\nto, after which their Royal Highnesses proceeded to the Yorkshire\r\nCollege. Here they were received, in the Clothworkers' Court, by the\r\nMarquis of Ripon, President of the College and Chairman of the Council,\r\nSir Edward Baines, Sir Andrew Fairbairn, Mr. Beckett Denison, and other\r\ndistinguished persons. Deputations of the London Companies, the Mayors\r\nof several Yorkshire boroughs, and Yorkshire Members of Parliament; the\r\nPrincipal and Professors of the College; and a numerous company had\r\nassembled. Prayer was offered by the Archbishop of York; an address was\r\nread by Professor Bodington, the Principal. Sir Edward Baines made a\r\nstatement as to the origin and growth of the College, in which he said\r\nthat he must mention a feature of the College which, so far as he knew,\r\nwas original and highly useful. Their professors had always been ready\r\nto deliver popular scientific lectures on extremely moderate terms, and\r\nthose lectures had proved very attractive, but recently they had\r\nundertaken, in addition, to give scientific instruction to the numerous\r\nteachers of elementary schools on Saturdays and several evenings of the\r\nweek, and thus they not only conferred a boon on the teachers, but\r\nqualified them to impart the elements of science to their scholars. A\r\ndouble advantage was realized to several hundreds of teachers and to\r\nthousands of scholars of elementary schools. The scholars were by these\r\nmeans introduced to such a knowledge of the elements of science as would\r\nqualify them to become useful members of mechanics' institutes, and\r\nmight in many cases implant a taste for higher attainments than had been\r\nlooked for either in the school or the institute.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales replied as follows to the address read by the\r\nPrincipal:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--We have received your addresses with\r\n    feelings of extreme gratification, and it affords us sincere\r\n    pleasure to be present here to-day, and to be able to take a\r\n    part in the inaugural ceremony in connection with this\r\n    important and useful institution. I have for a long time been\r\n    deeply impressed with the advisability of establishing in our\r\n    great centres of population colleges and schools, not only for\r\n    promoting the intellectual advancement of the people, but also,\r\n    as you have very justly observed, for increasing their\r\n    prosperity by furthering the application of scientific knowledge\r\n    to the industrial arts. I rejoice to hear that your laudable\r\n    endeavours have been duly appreciated, and have received liberal\r\n    support from various quarters, and I beg to offer my most hearty\r\n    congratulations to the great company of the Clothworkers of the\r\n    City of London for their judicious and liberal encouragement of\r\n    your College--an example which, I trust, will ere long find many\r\n    ready followers. We have inspected with considerable interest\r\n    the various lecture-rooms and laboratories over which you have\r\n    conducted us, and we have had much satisfaction in acceding to\r\n    your request to declare this valuable addition to the science\r\n    and art of the country open. I thank you, in conclusion, for\r\n    your expressions of loyalty and devotion to the Queen, which I\r\n    will not fail to communicate to Her Majesty. I declare the\r\n    Yorkshire College now open.\"\r\n\r\nThis concluded the proceedings in this part of the day's programme, and\r\nthe company then dispersed. The Royal visitors accepted an invitation\r\nfrom the authorities of the College to luncheon in the Coliseum, which\r\nis a newly-erected edifice affording much larger and better\r\naccommodation than any other building in the town for great public\r\ngatherings. Besides the invited guests, the two tiers of galleries were\r\novercrowded with spectators. The Marquis of Ripon, who presided, having\r\nproposed the usual loyal toasts, the Prince replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the name of the Princess and in my own, I beg to tender to\r\n    you, Lord Ripon, our warmest thanks and acknowledgments for the\r\n    very kind terms in which you have proposed this toast, and to\r\n    you, ladies and gentlemen, for the way in which you have\r\n    received it. I am anxious to tender to the mayor, as the\r\n    representative of the citizens of this large and important town,\r\n    our thanks also for the magnificent and cordial reception we\r\n    have met with to-day, one which we are not likely to forget.\r\n    This is certainly not the first visit I have paid to Leeds, as I\r\n    did so some seventeen years ago, but the pleasure on this\r\n    occasion is enhanced in my eyes as the Princess has been able\r\n    to accompany me. The mayor also alluded to the fact that the\r\n    visit of the Queen and of my lamented father had not been\r\n    forgotten, and we were glad to visit that very Town Hall which\r\n    they opened some twenty-six or twenty-seven years ago. I\r\n    consider that the object of our visit here is connected in some\r\n    respects with the visit of the Queen and my lamented father, as\r\n    he alluded at that time to the great importance of scientific\r\n    and technical education, and of a great town like this if\r\n    possible taking up the matter. In opening to-day that important\r\n    and useful building, the Yorkshire College, I feel I may in some\r\n    way have followed in his footsteps, by having been the means of\r\n    promoting what is of the greatest importance to our country, and\r\n    what is also of the greatest importance to the success of our\r\n    great commercial enterprises--viz., technical and scientific\r\n    education.\r\n\r\n    \"The building which we have visited to-day will always be in our\r\n    recollection one of great interest, and we feel sure that it is\r\n    likely to flourish and be of the greatest importance, and to set\r\n    an example to all the other great towns of the kingdom. The\r\n    rooms we visited, and all the arrangements for learning in a\r\n    scientific and technical manner not only the industries\r\n    themselves, but their scientific principles, cannot but be\r\n    productive of the greatest good not only now, but in years to\r\n    come. The College has received many great and munificent\r\n    donations, which will be read out later on, but I may mention\r\n    the names of Sir Andrew Fairbairn, the Duke of Devonshire, and\r\n    Lord Ripon, your President, as having contributed largely to the\r\n    funds of the institution. I must say also that those who are\r\n    interested in the College owe a deep debt of gratitude to the\r\n    Clothworkers' Company of the City of London, for the magnificent\r\n    donations which they have given are a proof of the importance of\r\n    this institution. They have also shown their interest in it, and\r\n    their belief that it is certain to be successful.\"\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness then referred to the importance attached to\r\n    music in Yorkshire, and to the great interest he had taken in\r\n    the Royal College of Music. He remarked that he thought the\r\n    promotion of that art would materially benefit all classes in\r\n    this country. Towards that College he knew nearly £1000 was\r\n    collected in Leeds, but that unfortunately was insufficient to\r\n    endow a scholarship, but if the president and directors of the\r\n    Yorkshire College could see their way at some future time to add\r\n    music to the list of subjects taught he felt sure they would not\r\n    in years to come regret it, and that it would be of great\r\n    benefit to the people of Leeds.\r\n\r\n    Before proceeding with the toast he had the privilege to\r\n    propose, \"Prosperity to the Yorkshire College,\" with which he\r\n    could not help feeling that he must associate the health of Lord\r\n    Ripon. He felt that they would wish him to say a word with\r\n    regard to its former president, one who was distinguished and\r\n    lovable in every sense of the word, and who was carried off by\r\n    the hand of the assassin in the midst of health and life. That\r\n    was indeed matter for thought and reflection, and he felt sure\r\n    that every Yorkshireman deeply regretted the death of Lord\r\n    Frederick Cavendish. In his successor, however, they had found\r\n    one who had occupied some of the most important offices which\r\n    could be held under the Crown, and who, having himself been\r\n    President of the Council on Education, was well fitted to hold\r\n    the high office which he now did. He therefore called on them to\r\n    drink with him, \"Prosperity to the Yorkshire College,\" with\r\n    which he had the greatest pleasure in coupling the name of their\r\n    president, Lord Ripon.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman, in acknowledging the warmth with which the toast was\r\nhonoured, alluded with pride to the position the College had in ten\r\nyears won. He hoped they would place the crown upon their work by coming\r\ninto union with the Victoria University at Manchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GORDON BOYS' HOME.\r\n\r\n_January 12th, 1886._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the sad tidings of the death of General Gordon at Khartoum had\r\nbeen confirmed, there was a universal desire to connect his name with\r\nsome national memorial. Tributes of honour were paid to him by the\r\nleaders of both parties in Parliament, and a grant was voted for a\r\npublic monument, in the form of a statue, which is now seen in Trafalgar\r\nSquare. But a desire was felt for some other memorial, and after much\r\nconsideration the most suitable was thought to be an institution for\r\ntraining boys of the class in whose welfare he took deep personal\r\ninterest. This was the origin of the Gordon Boys' Home, first located at\r\nFort Wallington, Fareham, and now having its permanent site at West End,\r\nChobham.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the first suggestion of a memorial the Prince of Wales\r\ntook the most active interest in the matter. He attended the early\r\nmeetings of the committee formed to carry out the proposal, and moved\r\nthe first resolution for a memorial at the Mansion House on May 30th,\r\n1885. At that time the idea was to found a hospital at Port Said, but\r\nthis scheme was not carried out. There seemed to be difficulty in\r\nagreeing about some fitter memorial, but the committee finally resolved\r\non the establishment of the Boys' Home, and the War Office granted the\r\nuse of Fort Wallington to commence the undertaking, for which the funds\r\nhad to be provided by public subscription. In support of this fund the\r\nPrince of Wales summoned a meeting at Marlborough House on the 12th of\r\nJanuary, 1886. At this meeting he said that \"having had the honour of\r\npresiding at the meeting of the Gordon Memorial Committee in the summer\r\nof 1885, he thought it desirable, at the beginning of another year, to\r\nsummon a meeting to hear what progress had been made.\" He told of the\r\nappointment of Major-General Tyndall, C.B., as commandant, and of his\r\ncommencing the work with a few boys at Fort Wallington, the number\r\ngradually rising to fifty. The Prince called on Lord Napier of Magdala\r\nto say a few words in addition to the formal report which was read.\r\n\r\nLord Napier of Magdala, as Chairman of the Executive Committee, then\r\npresented the report of the progress made in the establishment of the\r\nGordon Memorial Home. He said that on visiting the institution a few\r\ndays ago he found the boys on parade in a neat and appropriate uniform.\r\nThey looked clean, smart, and steady. The dormitories were like\r\nsoldiers' barrack-rooms, in perfect order. The lavatories gave every\r\nfacility for cleanliness. In the kitchen the boys all took a turn in\r\ncooking. In the workshops the pupil teachers were undergoing instruction\r\nin carpentry work. The school was well arranged and the teaching\r\neffective. In short, the progress of the institution was remarkable,\r\nconsidering the short time it had been established, and this was due to\r\nthe organization of General Higginson and the administration of General\r\nTyndall and his staff. Nor had the necessity for amusement been left\r\nunprovided for. The work was done in the spirit of the great soldier and\r\nChristian whom the institution commemorated, and the results were most\r\ngratifying.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I feel sure it must be gratifying to all of us to hear the\r\n    statements made by Lord Napier of Magdala of the satisfactory\r\n    manner in which the Gordon Boys' Home is progressing. I may\r\n    also say that all of us are indebted to the great energy which\r\n    Generals Higginson and Tyndall have displayed.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness then called on General Higginson, who pointed out the\r\nspecial advantages to be obtained by the institution, where the training\r\nwould fit the boys for any calling which they might choose, if they do\r\nnot go into the army. He said that \"this was a national memorial to a\r\ngreat man. It would be more than pitiful if an institution like this\r\nwere allowed to languish or to be cramped in its development. That would\r\nlead the world to believe that Gordon's memory was forgotten. The one\r\ngreat object Gordon had was to help the distressed, and he could not\r\nimagine that when it was known what work was being done the institution\r\nwould fail for want of funds.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge made a very earnest and generous appeal, and ended\r\nby telling the meeting that it was to the Prince of Wales that the\r\nsuccess of the movement would be mainly due. \"Gentlemen,\" said the Duke,\r\n\"we have had great praise bestowed, and justly bestowed, upon my gallant\r\nfriend Field-Marshal Lord Napier of Magdala and upon General Higginson,\r\nwho have taken up this interesting charge; but allow me to remark that\r\nthere is nobody to whom we owe so much as His Royal Highness the Prince\r\nof Wales. I do not wish to flatter him, but I must say that when the\r\nPrince takes up a subject he always does so thoroughly and well. I do\r\nnot think there has ever been a subject which he has taken up more\r\nfeelingly and thoroughly than he has taken up this Gordon Memorial, and\r\nhaving done honour to those who have assisted in the way they have, I\r\nthink we should do equal honour to His Royal Highness, and I therefore\r\nbeg to move a vote of thanks to him for the kind and gracious manner in\r\nwhich he has taken up this subject and has presided at this and other\r\nmeetings.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"After the kind and flattering remarks which have fallen from my\r\n    illustrious relative I regret to be under the painful necessity\r\n    of calling him to order, but there is a motion which has not yet\r\n    been put to the meeting. At the same time I thank him beforehand\r\n    most sincerely for what he has been good enough to say. You all\r\n    know the very great interest I take in this important matter,\r\n    and I feel sure it is right we should bring before the public as\r\n    much as possible the name of that great and distinguished\r\n    officer and Englishman who is now no more. He is not forgotten,\r\n    but as months and years go by so many important events come\r\n    before the public that sometimes other matters naturally are\r\n    considered more prominent, and even a name like General Gordon's\r\n    might be forgotten for a time. I am inclined to think there is\r\n    nothing that could perpetuate his memory in a more satisfactory\r\n    form in regard to his own relations, and what they think he\r\n    would have wished, than this boys' home. I cannot help thinking\r\n    'The Gordon Boys' Home' will be ever associated with the name of\r\n    General Charles Gordon.\r\n\r\n    \"To obtain money is always a difficulty. I do not doubt the\r\n    willingness of the public to give money, but their ability is\r\n    not always so great, and I have a suggestion to make to you\r\n    which may find favour in your eyes. If it is thought desirable\r\n    that we should have a public dinner, I should be happy to take\r\n    the chair. We could invite many to attend and give as much as\r\n    they were able, and I have great hopes that in that way, and\r\n    from speeches that may be made, the subject will be brought\r\n    still more prominently before the public, and that we may do\r\n    more good than by advertising.\" The resolution \"That the\r\n    Institution cannot be developed without larger funds, and it is\r\n    resolved that further effort be made to obtain them,\" was then\r\n    put to the meeting by His Royal Highness and carried.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge said: \"Having made my speech, I will not repeat\r\nit. I admit I was out of order, but I now beg to move a vote of thanks\r\nto His Royal Highness for his kindness in presiding on this occasion.\"\r\nThe motion was seconded by the Duke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThe leading article in the _Times_ on the following day thus closed:\r\n\"There are few benevolent institutions which offer fairer promise of\r\ngood results than the Gordon Boys' Home. But the care with which it has\r\nbeen organized and the special sphere which it seeks to fill enable us\r\nto press with greater confidence its peculiar claim to the support of\r\nthe English public, founded upon the fact that it forms a national\r\nmonument to the memory of a great Englishman. The heroism of General\r\nGordon, his betrayal by those who utilized his rare personal qualities\r\nin the hour of their need, and the tragic end of a life of simple\r\ndevotion to duty have been somewhat obscured by the ephemeral contests\r\nof the passing hour. Looking back over the records of the last few\r\nmonths, we are almost reduced to the sad and savage mood of\r\nHamlet--'then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life\r\nhalf a year.' But the memory of Gordon's life and death will be a point\r\nof light in the history of the Victorian age long after the strenuous\r\ntrifling of our politicians has sunk into forgetfulness. In honouring\r\nthis man of antique mould, this Englishman who in a somewhat tricky and\r\nsmall-minded age 'could do and dared not lie,' we shall far more honour\r\nourselves; and in munificently endowing a work such as he loved to carry\r\nout the nation will find itself twice blessed.\"\r\n\r\nThe London office of the Gordon Boys' Home is at 20, Cockspur Street,\r\nwithin sight of the statue in Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE MERSEY TUNNEL.\r\n\r\n_January 20th, 1886._\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more than half a century, in fact ever since the opening of the\r\nfirst English railway, it has been the dream of engineers to obtain\r\ndirect communication between Liverpool and Birkenhead, and the Welsh\r\nlines. The ferry-boat traffic had been enormous and ever increasing, but\r\nit little helped the transit of minerals and heavy goods. Even since the\r\nconstruction of the great Runcorn bridge the land route had been found\r\nlong and troublesome. It was not till 1870 that parliamentary sanction\r\ncould be obtained to make a direct route by tunnelling under the Mersey,\r\nbut attempts to carry out the scheme were not then successful. At\r\nlength, towards the close of 1879, an arrangement was made with Major\r\nIsaac, and from that time the work was unceasing, above 3000 men having\r\nbeen constantly employed. In 1886 the work was completed. The importance\r\nof the undertaking was recognized, and the Prince of Wales was invited\r\nto open \"The Mersey Tunnel.\" The Princess of Wales was unable to be\r\npresent, but on the 20th of January, 1886, the Prince, with his sons\r\nPrince Albert Victor and Prince George, came from Eaton Hall, where they\r\nwere the guests of the Duke of Westminster.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Birkenhead the Prince was escorted to a daïs, and an\r\naddress was read by Mr. Knight, the secretary, on behalf of the\r\nchairman. Mr. Cecil Raikes, M.P., and the directors, engineers,\r\ncontractors, and officers of \"The Mersey Railway Company.\" In reply His\r\nRoyal Highness said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Raikes and Gentlemen,--I thank you for your address and for\r\n    the cordial and loyal terms in which you have welcomed me here\r\n    to-day. I experience at all times sincere pleasure when\r\n    circumstances permit me to associate my name with any\r\n    undertaking tending to advance the welfare and convenience of\r\n    the community, and I accepted, therefore, with much satisfaction\r\n    your invitation to be present on this interesting occasion to\r\n    assist in the inauguration of a national work of such vast\r\n    importance. An enterprise of this nature is always deserving of\r\n    the warmest support and encouragement, as it not only completes\r\n    the railway system of the district, and thus provides constant\r\n    and easy means of communication between towns of such prominence\r\n    as Liverpool and Birkenhead, but it cannot fail also before long\r\n    to afford material benefit to the millions of hands in the\r\n    neighbouring industrial centres by aiding the more rapid\r\n    development of commercial intercourse. The heartiest\r\n    commendation should, therefore, be bestowed on all engaged in\r\n    the promotion of so great and worthy an object. I fervently\r\n    trust that well-merited success may be the result of your\r\n    labours, and that an ever-increasing prosperity may be your\r\n    reward for the difficulties which you have encountered, and\r\n    which have been mainly overcome by the admirable skill, the\r\n    indomitable patience, and the unceasing and unwearied energy\r\n    which have been displayed by all those who have contributed to\r\n    bring this work to a happy and a triumphant termination. Let me\r\n    convey to you, in conclusion, gentlemen, at the special request\r\n    of the Princess of Wales, the expression of her deep and\r\n    unfeigned regret at having been unavoidably prevented from\r\n    accompanying me here to-day. She begs me to assure you that\r\n    nothing but the imperative orders of the physicians would have\r\n    precluded her from sharing the gratification which I experience\r\n    at taking part in the proceedings which celebrate the\r\n    consummation of your most arduous task.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the cheers which greeted the Prince's speech had subsided, the\r\nMayor of Birkenhead, Mr. John Laird, was introduced to His Royal\r\nHighness, whom he asked to receive an address from the Corporation of\r\nthat town. The Recorder then read the address, which remarked--\"The\r\ncommunication between Birkenhead and Liverpool has hitherto been by a\r\nferry, one of the most ancient and important in the kingdom, first\r\nestablished at a very early period, and conferred by King Edward III.,\r\nin the year 1332, on the Prior and Convent of Birkenhead. It is a happy\r\ncoincidence that your Royal Highness should be present to open this new\r\nconnecting link between the county from which your Royal Highness\r\nderives the title of Earl of Chester and the Royal Duchy of Lancaster.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness made an appropriate reply, in which he said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--It has given me, I assure you,\r\n    unfeigned pleasure to have been able to comply with your\r\n    request to receive an address from the Mayor, Aldermen, and\r\n    Burgesses of the borough of Birkenhead, and I am confident that\r\n    though you may be one of the youngest of the corporate bodies,\r\n    you equal the oldest in loyalty and in devotion to the Queen and\r\n    the Royal Family. The completion of the work which I am about to\r\n    declare open will mark an important era in the history of this\r\n    district, for it will not only afford an improved line of\r\n    communication between two towns of so much consequence and\r\n    increasing prosperity as Birkenhead and Liverpool, but it will\r\n    likewise supply the means of easy and ready access to the\r\n    principality of Wales, with its places of picturesque beauty and\r\n    interest, and its numerous health resorts. The utility of the\r\n    undertaking cannot therefore be over-estimated.\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal party then re-entered the train, and after inspecting the\r\nworks at the station the train entered the tunnel, and in four minutes\r\nreached the James Street Station on the Liverpool side. They were raised\r\nto the street level by a hydraulic lift, and the Prince being conducted\r\nto a daïs in the waiting hall, said, \"I declare this station opened.\"\r\nProlonged cheering greeted the announcement, which was continued\r\nthroughout the route as the Princes drove to the Town Hall. In the\r\nCouncil-chamber an address was read by the Town Clerk from the\r\nCorporation, to which the Prince replied, acknowledging cordially the\r\nwelcome given to him, and the kind references to his family, adding:--\r\n\r\n    \"You rightly observe that I am deeply interested in every\r\n    movement that is calculated to tend to the advantage and\r\n    well-being of the people of this country, and it is a great\r\n    satisfaction to me to think that my name will be associated with\r\n    the memorable enterprise which by completing a connecting link\r\n    in our railway system supplies a want that has been long felt in\r\n    this part of the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nAt the luncheon afterwards given in the ball-room, where about 250\r\nguests had been invited, responding to the toast of his health, the\r\nPrince said that he had received, since his arrival in Liverpool, a\r\ntelegram from the Princess, regretting her absence, and saying how\r\ndeeply she was interested in the purpose of his visit. He also expressed\r\nhis thanks for the reference to his sons, who were much gratified by the\r\nopportunity of visiting this great town.\r\n\r\n    \"I have been engaged to-day, Mr. Mayor, on an interesting and\r\n    important work, which I feel convinced will be a very great\r\n    benefit, not only to the town of Liverpool, but to the vast\r\n    commercial resources of this and surrounding towns. The\r\n    difficulties in making a subterranean or subaqueous railway are\r\n    only too clear. You have hitherto had means of taking passengers\r\n    and goods over the river by steam ferries. I am aware that this\r\n    right has existed a long time--I believe as far back as the 11th\r\n    century. But it is a remarkable fact that in the last year you\r\n    conveyed across the Mersey, from Birkenhead to Liverpool, on the\r\n    steam ferries 26,000,000 passengers, and 750,000 tons of goods.\r\n    You may say, such being the case, why do you require to have\r\n    this tunnel, and to have your railway to connect Liverpool and\r\n    Birkenhead? The answer is that you have to encounter storms, you\r\n    have to encounter fogs, and you have to encounter ice. Both your\r\n    passengers and your goods are very frequently imperilled.\r\n    Therefore, a great engineering scheme of this kind, which will\r\n    be a very great boon, is one deserving of encouragement. Not\r\n    only will it benefit the commerce of the north-west of England,\r\n    but it will also open up a railway system to Wales and that\r\n    beautiful picturesque country with all its health-giving\r\n    resorts. Great praise is due to Major Isaac for the\r\n    indefatigable manner in which he has carried out this work and\r\n    has found the capital, and we have also to recognize the\r\n    indomitable energies of Mr. Brunlees and Mr. Fox, the engineers,\r\n    and I must not forget to mention the name of Mr. Waddell, the\r\n    contractor. At the head of this company we find my right hon.\r\n    friend, Mr. Cecil Raikes, who has had a long experience in\r\n    railways. Before sitting down, as I know there is no time for\r\n    long speeches, I wish most cordially to drink 'Prosperity to the\r\n    Mersey Railway,' which I am sure you will drink most heartily,\r\n    and to connect with the toast the name of its chairman, Mr.\r\n    Cecil Raikes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raikes, in responding, said he held it as a most happy omen for that\r\ngreat undertaking whose completion they celebrated, that the heir to the\r\nthrone should have come there to take part in completing an enterprise\r\nwhich would, he believed, be reckoned as one of the most important and\r\ninteresting of Her Majesty's reign. His Royal Highness had been good\r\nenough to refer especially to the connection which was now to be\r\nestablished between Liverpool and his principality of Wales. As a\r\nresident in that principality he could assure His Royal Highness that\r\nthe expression of interest would be cordially appreciated and treasured\r\nby the people of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ladies and Gentlemen,--Although the toast list is closed, I\r\n    have the permission of the Mayor to propose one more toast, and\r\n    I feel sure it is one which will recommend itself to you all, as\r\n    it is the health of the chairman of this entertainment, the\r\n    Mayor. You are aware of the Mayor's great popularity, and his\r\n    deserved popularity; for have you not re-elected him for a\r\n    second term of office as your Mayor? I feel that it is difficult\r\n    to praise him in his presence, but at the same time he will\r\n    forgive me if I say that I know how the inhabitants of Liverpool\r\n    have been grateful to him for the great kindness, generosity,\r\n    and philanthropy he lately evinced at Christmas, when he gave\r\n    that well-known and popular Lancashire dish, the hotchpotch, to\r\n    the poor inhabitants of your town. That kindness will not be\r\n    forgotten by them, and it will be gratifying to him to know the\r\n    good he did and the pleasure he gave on that occasion. As for\r\n    myself, this is not my first visit to Liverpool, and I hope by\r\n    no means it may be my last. I have always been received here\r\n    with the greatest kindness, and I have always looked back to my\r\n    different visits with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction.\r\n    The fact that 100 years ago this town numbered only 40,000\r\n    people, and now, with its suburbs, numbers close upon 700,000,\r\n    speaks for its prosperity. Most cordially do I propose this\r\n    toast, Mr. Mayor, and most sincerely do I wish long life to you,\r\n    and prosperity to your town.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mayor briefly replied, and the proceedings terminated; the Prince\r\nand his sons drove in an open carriage to the station, great crowds in\r\nthe streets cheering them, and returned to London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS.\r\n\r\n_March 27th, 1886._\r\n\r\n\r\nNot for the first, nor the second time, the Prince of Wales was\r\nentertained at the Annual Dinner of the Institution of Civil Engineers,\r\non the 27th of March, 1886. The banquet was held on this occasion in the\r\nhall of Lincoln's Inn, the use of which was kindly granted by the\r\nBenchers. The Prince was accompanied by Prince Albert Victor and the\r\nDuke of Cambridge. A very large company of distinguished men in various\r\nwalks of life, as well as the leading engineers of the day, were\r\npresent, about two hundred in all.\r\n\r\nThe President, Sir Frederick Bramwell (the President of the British\r\nAssociation at Bath in 1888), in giving the usual loyal toasts, took\r\noccasion to mention that of the Royal guests, two, the Prince of Wales\r\nand the Duke of Cambridge, were honorary members of the Institution of\r\nCivil Engineers, and he hoped that the third would before long be added\r\nto the list.\r\n\r\nIn responding to the toast of \"The Prince and Princess of Wales and the\r\nrest of the Royal Family,\" after expressing his grateful thanks, the\r\nPrince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"In coming here this evening among you I feel that I am not a\r\n    stranger, as you have paid me the high compliment of enrolling\r\n    me as an honorary member of your Institution. At the same time I\r\n    consider it a high privilege, and I may say a high honour, to\r\n    dine here at this your annual banquet, as I am sure no one will\r\n    gainsay me when I assert that an Institution like this is one of\r\n    the most important in this country, and one for which we have\r\n    the highest respect. I do not know what we should do without the\r\n    civil engineers. How could we cross rivers? How could we go\r\n    under them? Where would be the roads? Where would be the\r\n    railways? And, perhaps, most important of all, where would be\r\n    those great works of sanitation, which are of such vital concern\r\n    to all countries and to all towns? For all these things are left\r\n    in your hands.\r\n\r\n    \"Some years have elapsed since I last had the pleasure of dining\r\n    here, and in the interval I well know that civil engineers have\r\n    not been idle. I may just mention a few works which have come\r\n    under my own observation, not only in this country but in India,\r\n    works which have been carried out by civil engineers, though all\r\n    may not, perhaps, be members of this Institution. The first that\r\n    occurs to me is the new Eddystone Lighthouse, of which I myself\r\n    had the pleasure to assist in placing the first stone. Then\r\n    there are those great works which will be handed down to\r\n    posterity and of which civil engineers will ever be proud--I\r\n    refer to the Mersey and Severn Tunnels. The former work I had\r\n    the great pleasure of opening two months ago. Then comes the\r\n    Forth Bridge, not yet completed; I visited the works two years\r\n    ago, and I hope in two, or at most three years we may see the\r\n    great bridge in working order. While referring to these great\r\n    works, which will always remain mementoes of the ability of the\r\n    civil engineers of our time, I must not forget to allude to a\r\n    more distant evidence of engineering skill--viz., the Alexandra\r\n    Bridge in India, which was built over the River Chenab, and\r\n    which I had the good fortune to open now ten years ago.\r\n\r\n    \"I might speak for a long time if I detailed all the important\r\n    works constructed by civil engineers that I have seen, and\r\n    especially if I were to mention also a string of illustrious\r\n    names familiar to every one. But I shall abstain from doing so\r\n    now, first because, as you hear, my voice is not very good, and\r\n    in the second place because it has been agreed upon that there\r\n    are not to be any very long speeches. It is my satisfaction now\r\n    before sitting down to propose a toast which I am sure will be\r\n    most gratefully and sympathetically received by the company, and\r\n    that is 'The Health of your President, Sir Frederick Bramwell.'\r\n    I cannot allude to him in the manner I should like, or enumerate\r\n    all the distinguished services which he has rendered to his\r\n    country; but one thing I will venture to say, and that is that\r\n    his name will always be honourably connected with the\r\n    advancement of technical education. The interest he has taken in\r\n    that great subject, and the labour he has bestowed on it, have\r\n    gained for him the high honour, conferred by his Sovereign, of\r\n    the order of knighthood, and I am sure he will still continue to\r\n    devote his time and energies to a measure which is of the\r\n    greatest importance to this country. For myself I may say that I\r\n    also owe him a deep debt of gratitude for the services he has\r\n    rendered as chairman of the executive committee of the recent\r\n    Inventions Exhibition. I have now the great pleasure of\r\n    proposing the toast of 'Prosperity to the Institution of Civil\r\n    Engineers,' coupled with the name of your President Sir\r\n    Frederick Bramwell.\"\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Bramwell made an amusing speech, in which he highly\r\nmagnified the office of the Civil Engineer as contrasted with every\r\nother profession. The Duke of Cambridge spoke well, as usual, for the\r\nArmy, and Lord Charles Beresford gave a supplementary speech, in\r\nresponse to loud calls, after Admiral Le Hunte Ward had responded for\r\nthe Navy. The improvements in both military and naval armaments due to\r\ncivil engineers were duly recognized by all the speakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE COLONIAL OFFICE.\r\n\r\n_April 29th, 1886._\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Henry Holland (now Lord Knutsford), as Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies, entertained the representatives at the Colonial Conference,\r\nand various gentlemen connected with the Crown Colonies, at a dinner at\r\nthe Colonial Office, on the 29th of April, 1886. The Prince of Wales,\r\nthe Duke of Abercorn, the Marquis of Lorne, the Earl of Carnarvon, and\r\nthe Earl of Rosebery were among those present. The loyal toasts being\r\ngiven, Sir Henry Holland said that to the hard work and warm sympathy of\r\nthe Prince of Wales the success of the Colonial Exhibition was largely\r\ndue. The Prince, in acknowledging the toast, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Henry Holland, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--When Sir Henry\r\n    Holland was kind enough to invite me here this evening to meet\r\n    the colonial delegates I was under the impression that it was a\r\n    private dinner, in so far that I should not be called upon to\r\n    make a speech. In this respect he has sprung a mine upon me.\r\n    But, notwithstanding, I beg to thank him for the very kind way\r\n    in which he has proposed this toast, and to thank you for the\r\n    cordial manner in which you have received it. I can only assure\r\n    him and you of the very great pleasure it gives me to meet you\r\n    here this evening.\r\n\r\n    \"In this large gathering there are many gentlemen connected with\r\n    the colonies whom I have had the pleasure of knowing personally,\r\n    and it affords me especial pleasure to make the acquaintance of\r\n    others who have come over in connection with this occasion. I am\r\n    aware that the proceedings of the conferences which have taken\r\n    place have been kept secret from the public in a most marvellous\r\n    way, which is not an easy matter in these days. But from the\r\n    words which have fallen from Sir Henry Holland I am glad to hear\r\n    that everything has been so prosperous, and I hope that the\r\n    important and difficult questions which have been discussed\r\n    during the last few weeks will bear fruit. Nobody wishes more\r\n    sincerely than I do that the good feeling, or, as the French\r\n    say, the _entente cordiale_, between the mother country and our\r\n    great colonies may be established on a still firmer basis. Far\r\n    be it from us, and far distant may the day be, when we shall see\r\n    the colonies separated from us in any way.\r\n\r\n    \"You have been kind enough to allude to the Colonial Exhibition,\r\n    which is now a matter of the past. I feel sure that in that\r\n    Exhibition, during the few months that it lasted, our own\r\n    countrymen learnt perhaps more of the colonies than they could\r\n    in any other way except by visiting them. No better means could\r\n    have been adopted for bringing the colonies more prominently\r\n    before us. Most sincerely do I hope that that Exhibition may\r\n    bear fruit. I most sincerely trust that the end of the\r\n    Conference may also be successful, and that it may realise all\r\n    that we could wish. It is true, as you have observed, that I\r\n    have not yet had an opportunity of visiting the distant\r\n    colonies, especially the Australian colonies and those of the\r\n    Cape. Much as I may desire to go out to those distant colonies,\r\n    I fear that my duties at home may prevent my doing so. However,\r\n    I assure you that it is my wish to do so, and though I am\r\n    unable, it is through circumstances over which I have no\r\n    control.\"\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery, in giving the toast of their Colonial guests, said, that\r\nwhatever questions of home policy divided Englishmen, party feeling\r\nnever interfered in those greater Imperial questions. It was a happy\r\ninnovation to invite representatives of the colonies to meet in\r\nconference, and he trusted that the result of that meeting would hasten\r\nthe welding and uniting of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION AS GRAND MASTER OF MARK MASONS.\r\n\r\n_July 1st, 1886._\r\n\r\n\r\nA large and most imposing gathering, held in connexion with the Grand\r\nLodge of Mark Master Masons, took place at the Freemasons' Hall on the\r\n1st of July, 1886. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, whose\r\ninstallation as Grand Master of English Freemasons, at the Albert Hall,\r\nin April 1875, has been already narrated, was now installed as Grand\r\nMark Master. There were upwards of 1000 Grand, Past, and Provincial\r\nGrand Officers present, including many distinguished representatives\r\nfrom India and the Colonies, as well as from all parts of the United\r\nKingdom. The Earl of Kintore, Grand Master, presided at the ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince entered the Grand Lodge, which had been opened by Lord\r\nKintore, he was accompanied by a large and representative body of Mark\r\nMasons deputed to conduct His Royal Highness to the throne. He then\r\ntook the customary obligation, having been proclaimed and saluted on the\r\nthrone, to which he was conducted by Lord Kintore. Addressing the\r\nPrince, Lord Kintore expressed the feelings of loyal devotion felt by\r\nevery Mark Mason in Great Britain, and in the Greater Britain beyond the\r\nseas, at the step which the Prince was pleased to take that day. He then\r\ngave a few statistics to show the progress of Mark Masonry. In 1876\r\nthere were but 5 time-immemorial lodges, and 18 Provincial Grand Lodges.\r\nIn 1886 there were 13 time-immemorial lodges, and 375 warranted lodges,\r\ndivided into 44 Provincial Grand Lodges, including those in New Zealand,\r\nSouth Africa, Australia, India, and other parts of the globe. The\r\nconsent of the Prince of Wales to be Grand Mark Master was proof of his\r\nzealous personal efforts to unite the Colonies and Dependencies of the\r\nempire with the mother country. The Prince, in his reply, said that--\r\n\r\n    He thanked the Past Grand Master most heartily and sincerely for\r\n    the address he had just delivered. He feared that Lord Kintore\r\n    had referred to him in terms far too kind and flattering. He\r\n    assured the brethren he considered it a high honour and\r\n    compliment which had been paid him that day, and he accepted the\r\n    distinguished position of Grand Master of Mark Master Masons\r\n    with a deep feeling of gratitude, and as a high honour to\r\n    himself. He assured the brethren that anything he could do to\r\n    further the interest and welfare of the Mark Degree would be\r\n    done with sincere pleasure. He was most thankful and grateful\r\n    for the kind feeling the brethren had manifested towards him,\r\n    and he appreciated very highly the compliment which had been\r\n    paid by the Mark Masons who had attended from distant parts of\r\n    the kingdom. Lord Kintore had spoken in kind and feeling terms\r\n    of his beloved mother the Queen. It would afford Her Majesty\r\n    sincere gratification to know the kind terms in which her name\r\n    had been mentioned, and the hearty manner in which it was\r\n    invariably received, especially in a meeting of this\r\n    description. Personally he thanked them from his heart, and he\r\n    desired to assure them that all he could do for the welfare of\r\n    Mark Masonry would always be done with very great pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master then appointed the Grand Officers for the ensuing year,\r\nbeginning with Lord Kintore as Pro-Grand Master, Lord Egerton of Tatton\r\nDeputy Grand Master, the Duke of Connaught Senior Grand Warden, and\r\nnumerous others to the usual offices. The Pro-Grand Master presented the\r\nPrince with a jewel, which he accepted with pleasure, and said it would\r\nbe a gratifying memento of the pleasant proceedings of the day.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the Grand Lodge proceedings, there was a\r\nluncheon at the Holborn Restaurant, at which the Prince presided. After\r\nthe customary loyal toasts had been proposed, the Prince regretted that\r\nhe had to leave, having to fulfil an engagement at the East-end of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDATION STONE OF THE PEOPLE'S PALACE.\r\n\r\n_June 28th, 1886._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few who do not know the history, and have not rejoiced in the\r\nsuccess of the People's Palace for East London. The magnificent\r\nspectacle when the Queen went in state, on the 14th of May, 1887, to\r\nopen \"The Queen's Hall\" at the Palace, will long be remembered by the\r\nmultitudes who witnessed the ceremony, or who saw the Royal progress\r\nthrough the crowded streets.\r\n\r\nThe foundation stone had been laid, with almost equal pomp, and amidst\r\nas great popular enthusiasm, by the Prince and Princess of Wales on the\r\n28th of June in the previous year. On that occasion nearly 10,000 people\r\nwere assembled within the space set apart for the ceremony, including\r\n1000 delegates from the various trade, friendly, and temperance\r\nsocieties in East London, with 2000 or 3000 school-children.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor in his robes of office, and attended by the officers and\r\nmany members of the Corporation, and a vast number of distinguished\r\npersons--among whom were the Chief Rabbi, Dr. Adler, the Bishop of\r\nBedford, and many of the Clergy of the neighbouring districts, Cardinal\r\nManning, and Mr. Walter Besant--awaited the arrival of the Royal\r\nvisitors. This was announced by a salute by the guard of honour of the\r\nTower Hamlets Engineers and the 24th Middlesex Volunteers. They were\r\nreceived by Sir Edmund Hay Currie and the Beaumont Trustees, the Master\r\nand Wardens of the Drapers' Company, and delegates from various\r\nCommittees. From the old and well-known \"Beaumont Trust,\" and the\r\nmunificent donations of the Drapers' Company, supplemented by public\r\ncontributions, the large funds necessary for the People's Palace had\r\nbeen derived.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony began by the Archbishop of Canterbury offering a special\r\nprayer, followed by the Lord's Prayer, and the singing of the Old\r\nHundredth Psalm. Sir E. H. Currie, Chairman of the Committee, then read\r\nand presented an address, to which the Prince replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Edmund Hay Currie and Gentlemen,--I thank you, on behalf of\r\n    the Princess of Wales and myself, for your address, and I can\r\n    assure you that we heartily rejoice that an opportunity has been\r\n    afforded us of again visiting this important district of the\r\n    Metropolis. We thoroughly appreciate the endeavour of the\r\n    trustees to promote a scheme which, from the comprehensiveness\r\n    and liberality of its scope, should not fail to prove\r\n    advantageous to the population of the near neighbourhood in\r\n    which the Palace is to be erected, and to the inhabitants of the\r\n    Metropolis at large. We do not doubt that the opportunities for\r\n    healthy recreation so essential in a population that is\r\n    comprised mainly of artisans and mechanics and their families\r\n    will be promptly and properly appreciated by those for whom the\r\n    People's Palace had been provided. The facilities which will be\r\n    afforded for continuous education of all kinds will, we are\r\n    convinced, materially tend to still further develop and perfect\r\n    the various handicrafts of this neighbourhood, and should\r\n    therefore prove of the greatest importance, not only to the\r\n    inhabitants of East London, but to the nation at large, and\r\n    should enable Englishmen to continue to maintain in the future,\r\n    as they have in the past, that supremacy in the arts of peace at\r\n    home which, among civilized nations, must be the invariable and\r\n    necessary accompaniment of power and prosperity abroad. We\r\n    congratulate the trustees upon the success which has already\r\n    attended their efforts in having secured £75,000 of the £100,000\r\n    required, and we sincerely trust that the munificent donations\r\n    of the Drapers' Company, Mr. Dyer Edwardes, Lord Rosebery, and\r\n    the Duke of Westminster will influence others to follow so\r\n    excellent an example. The 'Queen's Hall,' of which I am about to\r\n    lay the first stone, will, I understand from the architect, Mr.\r\n    Robson, be capable of accommodating more than 3000 persons, and\r\n    will be so constructed as to serve the purpose of a winter\r\n    garden, affording a resort for social intercourse and\r\n    entertainment at a period of the year when the summer garden\r\n    will not be available. We humbly join in the prayer of the\r\n    Archbishop of Canterbury that God's blessing may rest upon this\r\n    great work, and that, in the years to come, benefits both\r\n    material and moral will result to the thousands who, we trust,\r\n    will not fail to avail themselves of the facilities which the\r\n    scheme will afford.\"\r\n\r\nThe stone was then laid with the usual ceremonies, the Prince's\r\ndeclaration that it was \"well and truly\" laid being received with\r\ngeneral cheers. The proceedings were concluded with the benediction,\r\npronounced by the Archbishop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLong before the time of the People's Palace, visits to the East of\r\nLondon had not unfrequently been made by members of the Royal Family. On\r\nthe 24th of June, 1880, the Prince and Princess of Wales, accompanied by\r\ntheir sons, Prince Albert Victor and Prince George, went to open a\r\nRecreation Ground in Whitechapel, for the benefit of the people of that\r\nparish, and of Bethnal Green, Spitalfields, and other adjacent\r\ndistricts. The ground, above an acre in extent, had formerly been a\r\nburial-ground of the Society of Friends, some of the members of which\r\nhad contributed towards its being laid out as a pleasure-garden. The\r\nRev. J. F. Kitto and the Rev. S. A. Barnett, whose names have long been\r\nassociated with good deeds in East London, hoped that the presence of\r\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales that day would give new impetus to the\r\nmovement for obtaining open spaces in crowded parts of the Metropolis.\r\nThe Prince expressed his gratification at being present, and said he was\r\ndesired by the Princess to say that she declared the Recreation Ground\r\nnow open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALE OF SHORTHORNS AND SOUTHDOWNS AT SANDRINGHAM.\r\n\r\n_July 15th, 1886._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be \"President of the Royal Agricultural Society of England\" is an\r\nhonour which the Prince of Wales gained not merely from his high\r\nposition, but from his genuine love and practical knowledge of\r\nagriculture. Old King George III. was proud to be known as \"Farmer\r\nGeorge,\" but his great-grandson, the \"Norfolk farmer,\" knows vastly more\r\nabout the subject, and turns his knowledge to more profitable account.\r\nThis was shown at the great sale of Shorthorn cattle and Southdown sheep\r\nwhich the Prince held at Sandringham, at the time of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Show at Norwich, in July 1886.\r\n\r\nThe idea of holding the sale at that time was a fortunate one, for the\r\nShow had brought to Norwich breeders of stock from every part of the\r\nkingdom, and some from foreign countries. Many of the leading members of\r\nthe Royal Agricultural Society were the guests of the Prince at\r\nSandringham during the week of the Show. Special trains were run to\r\nWolferton Station from Norwich, so that there had never been seen such\r\ncrowds at Sandringham, as on Thursday, the 15th of July, the day of the\r\nsale. Ample provision had been made for their reception, a large marquee\r\ncapable of seating 1500 persons being erected in a field adjacent to\r\nthe homestead. Among those who sat down to the luncheon were almost all\r\nthe agricultural celebrities of England, and some of the most noted\r\nbreeders of cattle and sheep in France. The entrance of the Prince and\r\nhis family to the tent was received with immense enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon the Prince proposed the health of the Queen, which was\r\nduly honoured, and then the Duke of Richmond and Gordon gave the toast\r\nof \"The Prince and Princess of Wales.\" He said that two days before it\r\nhad fallen to his lot to move a vote of thanks to the Prince in his\r\ncapacity as President of the Royal Agricultural Society of England,\r\nwhich might be deemed the Royal Academy of farming. Now he had to speak\r\nof him in his capacity of a Norfolk farmer. Amid much cheering, the Duke\r\nwent on to say that it would be well for Norfolk farmers if all of them\r\nhad such a wife as it was the good fortune of the Prince to possess, and\r\nthat the high qualities of the Princess had endeared her not less to the\r\npeople of Norfolk than to the other inhabitants of her future realm. In\r\nspeaking of the sale itself, the Duke said that the quality of the\r\nstock, all of which he had personally examined, was remarkably level and\r\ngood, and that the Prince was conferring a distinct benefit upon the\r\nagricultural community in the eastern counties by giving them an\r\nopportunity of obtaining such grand strains of blood as were to be found\r\nin the Sandringham Shorthorns and Southdowns. It is needless to add that\r\nthis toast was received with the most enthusiastic cheering, and the\r\nplaudits were so sustained that the Prince had to wait some time before\r\nbeginning his reply. He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Grace, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--The kind way in\r\n    which this toast has been proposed by the Duke of Richmond and\r\n    Gordon and received by you all cannot but give the greatest\r\n    possible pleasure both to the Princess and myself. We derive the\r\n    most genuine satisfaction at seeing so many of the inhabitants\r\n    of Norfolk here in our country home, for I can assure you that\r\n    we take the deepest interest in all that concerns the welfare of\r\n    this county. This has been a week of great agricultural interest\r\n    for the county of Norfolk, and we have among us many men eminent\r\n    as breeders and farmers from other parts of the kingdom, and to\r\n    them also I extend a cordial welcome. As we have a busy\r\n    afternoon before us, I will not detain you long, but before\r\n    sitting down I should like to say a few words with respect to\r\n    the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution, which has urgent\r\n    need of support, as, owing to the recent depression in\r\n    agriculture, the demands upon it have been so heavy that it is\r\n    unable to do as much as it could a few years ago. In conclusion,\r\n    let me bid you heartily welcome to Sandringham, and ask you to\r\n    bid well at the sale.\"\r\n\r\nThis genial speech was received with applause, and its closing words\r\nwith cheerful laughter. The Duke of Manchester next proposed the health\r\nof Mr. John Thornton, the auctioneer, who may be regarded as the\r\nTattersall of the Shorthorn world, and who, in responding, said that he\r\nwas more anxious to hear others than others would be to hear him. The\r\ncompany then broke up, the Prince and Princess of Wales leading the way\r\nto the sale-ring, which had been pitched close to the homestead, with\r\nthree covered stands for the Royal party, the auctioneer and his chief\r\ncustomers, and for the county people, who mustered in great force.\r\n\r\nThe auctioneer gave much interesting information as to the establishment\r\nof the herd of Shorthorns and the flock of Southdowns at Sandringham.\r\nSince the herd of Shorthorns was formed the Prince of Wales has been in\r\nthe habit of exhibiting at the Royal and other shows held within easy\r\nreach of home, and the animals selected for exhibition, but not forced\r\ninto extreme condition, as is so often done, have been very successful,\r\nfor they have taken sixteen first prizes, twelve seconds, four thirds,\r\nand four special prizes, while it is interesting to note that at the\r\nRoyal Agricultural Show at York three years ago the Prince obtained what\r\nis generally regarded as the highest honour of the showyard--viz., the\r\nprize for a family group consisting of mother and several daughters.\r\n\r\nThe Prince has been not less conspicuously successful with his Southdown\r\nsheep, as this flock, first formed in 1886 by the selection of sheep\r\nfrom the flocks of the Duke of Richmond at Goodwood, Lord Walsingham at\r\nMerton, Mr. Webb at Babraham, and Mr. Gorringe at Kingston, has won\r\nsixty-eight first and sixty-two second prizes, to say nothing of minor\r\ndistinctions, bringing the total of prizes up to 183, while at the\r\nSmithfield Show last winter three Southdowns from Sandringham won the\r\n£50 champion cup and the gold medal as the best pen of sheep in the\r\nhall. These facts being well known to all those who attended the sale,\r\nwhile they had the further assurance that all the lots offered would be\r\nsold without any of those reservations which mar so many auctions, the\r\nbidding was very brisk; but in spite of this the number of lots was so\r\ngreat that the sale, commencing at two o'clock, lasted until nearly six.\r\n\r\nThe detail of the sale only concern those who have to do with buying or\r\nbreeding: and the records of the pedigree stock, and the prices\r\nobtained, and other particulars, will be found in the reports of the\r\nmeeting. To the general reader of this book the whole proceedings are\r\nfull of interest, as being a scene of genuine English country life, and\r\nthe Prince of Wales was thoroughly in his element as the centre of the\r\ngrand agricultural assemblage. How Washington Irving would have rejoiced\r\nto be there, and what a description he would have given of the scene!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSION COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n_December 15th, 1886._\r\n\r\n\r\nSion College was founded by the Rev. Dr. White, Vicar of St. Dunstan's\r\nin the West, in the time of Charles I. He held several other\r\npreferments, but we forgive him for being a notable pluralist because he\r\nmade such good use of his money. By his will he left £3000 for the\r\npurchase of a site in the City of London, for erecting a hospital,\r\nconsisting of twenty almshouses, and a college, which he endowed, with\r\nan annual revenue, not large, but sufficient in those times. Dr. White's\r\nintention was to enable the clergy of the City of London, and the\r\nincumbents of outlying parishes, to obtain corporate existence, like\r\nother crafts and professions, and so be legally qualified to hold and to\r\nadminister property. This was well carried out by the Rev. Dr. Simpson,\r\nRector of St. Olave's, Hart Street, one of the executors, who gave\r\nspecial attention to the library, now so important a feature of the\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nThe College was established by Charter in 1630, and confirmed in 1664 by\r\nCharles II. The site selected was that of the Priory of Elsing Spital,\r\nLondon Wall, where a spacious building was afterwards erected, and\r\ncontinued in use till our own day. The library gradually became an\r\nimportant one, especially after 1710, when the Government conferred upon\r\nit the privilege of being one of the libraries entitled to receive\r\ncopies of all books entered at Stationers' Hall. In 1843 this privilege\r\nwas commuted for an annual grant, which barely sufficed for the\r\nmaintenance of the library and other expenses. At length it was\r\ndetermined to sell the site in London Wall, the value of which was great\r\nfor business purposes, and to remove to a better site, on which more\r\ncommodious buildings might be erected. By Acts of Parliament authority\r\nwas obtained to sell the old site, which realized thirty-three times the\r\namount given for it in 1627. Another Act of Parliament authorized the\r\npurchase of a site on the Thames Embankment, the freehold of which cost\r\n£31,625, and on this, at a cost of £25,000, the present magnificent\r\nbuilding, designed by Mr. A. W. Blomfield, was erected. To open this new\r\nSion College, the Prince of Wales, accompanied by the Princess of Wales,\r\nwent to the City on the 15th of December, 1886.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, and several Bishops, the Lord Mayor and\r\nSheriffs of London, the Lord Chancellor, and many distinguished persons\r\nwere present, and a numerous body of the Clergy. The President of the\r\nCollege (who is elected annually by the Fellows), the Rev. Richard\r\nWhittington, a name of good omen, read an address, the Archbishop having\r\npreviously conducted a short religious service. To the address the\r\nPrince replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President and Gentlemen,--I thank you for your address, and\r\n    for the kind terms in which you allude to the Princess of Wales\r\n    and my children. I experience the greatest satisfaction at being\r\n    present on this interesting occasion, when your ancient\r\n    corporation may be said to take a new departure. I are gratified\r\n    to learn that the words of advice which I uttered two or three\r\n    years ago have borne good fruit and have helped on the removal\r\n    of your College from the comparative obscurity of London Wall to\r\n    this central and eligible spot. I congratulate you on the\r\n    completion without any serious drawback of a work which from its\r\n    nature could not but be surrounded by many administrative and\r\n    financial difficulties, only to be overcome by much tenacity of\r\n    purpose, energy, and hard work. Many of you will probably look\r\n    back with some feeling of lingering regret upon a spot hallowed\r\n    by the memories of two centuries and a half, and by the\r\n    recollection that in the same place, for many years before Sion\r\n    College existed, the Augustinian canons devoted themselves to\r\n    the alleviation of suffering, and providing a refuge for the\r\n    homeless and the outcast. Yet, if Sion College was to continue\r\n    its work in the future as it has carried it on in the past, such\r\n    a change as I inaugurate to-day was essential. On this site and\r\n    with this building, upon the beauty and convenience of which\r\n    your architect may well come in for his share of congratulation\r\n    and praise, Sion College may become more than ever a centre\r\n    where the London clergy may meet together to exchange\r\n    experiences and learn by personal intercourse how substantial is\r\n    the tie which results from devotion to one high purpose. Of your\r\n    library I need say little. The high place which it occupies\r\n    among similar institutions is well known, and the extent and\r\n    excellence of its contents are universally acknowledged. I have\r\n    to congratulate the clergy of London upon having at their\r\n    command such a varied collection of the best literature of all\r\n    ages to stimulate their studies and enrich their minds. I will\r\n    only add an expression of my satisfaction at learning that\r\n    those poor persons for whose temporal wants your benevolent\r\n    founder, Dr. Thomas White, made provision have reason to claim a\r\n    full share in the gratification which attends the proceedings\r\n    to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor said it was a great privilege for him to be called on, as\r\nLord Mayor, to say a few words on that most interesting occasion. He\r\ncongratulated the President and Fellows that Sion College was rebuilt\r\nunder such favourable auspices and so happily placed between those\r\nseminaries of the law, the ancient and honourable societies of the\r\nTemple, of which His Royal Highness was so distinguished a member, and\r\nthe more modern institution, on which he thought the Corporation might\r\njustly pride itself, the City of London School for the classical and\r\ncommercial training of our younger citizens, which His Royal Highness\r\ngraciously inaugurated just four years ago.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor said there were no words of his which would\r\nadequately express the gratitude and affection which all those present\r\nfelt towards His Royal Highness and the Princess. This was only one of a\r\nseries of acts by which their Royal Highnesses had exhibited their\r\nsympathy with the people, and there was nothing good, high, and noble\r\nthat was not from time to time graced by their presence.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales then, amid loud cheers, declared the library to be\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThe procession, having been re-formed, left the library and descended to\r\nthe hall, which was also filled with spectators. Here the President\r\npointed out the ancient panels, the pictures, including portrait of the\r\nfounder, and other treasures removed from the old building. The Prince\r\ndeclared the Hall open, and their Royal Highnesses signed their names in\r\nthe Register of Benefactors.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that it was a hint from the Prince of Wales that\r\nhastened the decision to remove from London Wall. He was viewing from\r\nthe roof of the old library the fire in Wood Street, Cheapside, when he\r\nsaid to the Rev. W. H. Milman (the librarian, son of Dean Milman) that\r\nhe thought it was the duty of the Governors to remove their valuable\r\nlibrary to a safer locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL AND INDIAN EXHIBITION OF 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, 1884, the Queen issued a Royal Commission to\r\narrange for holding an Exhibition of the products, manufactures, and\r\narts of Her Majesty's Colonial and Indian Dominions, in the year 1886.\r\nOf this Commission the Prince of Wales was President, and Sir Philip\r\nCunliffe-Owen Secretary. The first meeting took place at Marlborough\r\nHouse on the 30th of March, 1885. In opening the proceedings His Royal\r\nHighness said:--\r\n\r\n    \"In addressing you for the first time, I would remind you that\r\n    the objects for which Her Majesty has been pleased to appoint\r\n    this Commission are, briefly, to organise and carry out an\r\n    Exhibition by which the reproductive resources of our Colonies\r\n    and of the Indian Empire may be brought before the people of\r\n    Great Britain, and by which also the distant portions of Her\r\n    Majesty's Dominions may be enabled to compare the advance made\r\n    by each other in trade, manufactures, and general material\r\n    progress.\r\n\r\n    \"This project, to the realisation of which I have looked forward\r\n    for some years, is essentially one of a National and Imperial\r\n    character, differing in this respect front former Exhibitions,\r\n    in which the elements of trade rivalry and profit largely\r\n    existed.\r\n\r\n    \"No such opportunity of becoming practically acquainted with the\r\n    economic condition of our Colonies and the Indian Empire has\r\n    ever been afforded in this country. The attractive display in\r\n    the Indian and Colonial Courts at the Paris Exhibition of 1878\r\n    could only be witnessed by a comparatively small number of the\r\n    population of these Islands, millions of whom may be expected to\r\n    view and profit by the evidence which the Exhibition of 1886\r\n    will afford of the marvellous progress made by their\r\n    fellow-countrymen beyond the seas.\r\n\r\n    \"I also trust that this gathering may serve even a higher\r\n    purpose, and be the means not only of giving a stimulus to\r\n    commercial interests and intercourse, but of strengthening that\r\n    Bond of Union between Her Majesty's subjects in all parts of the\r\n    Empire, the growth and manifestation of which are most sincerely\r\n    appreciated by us all.\r\n\r\n    \"Whilst Her Majesty's Government have given their hearty\r\n    approval to the objects for which the Commission has been\r\n    appointed, they have not so far found it desirable to make any\r\n    definite grant towards it. The Commission have, therefore, to\r\n    rely entirely upon the public support of the great purposes\r\n    which the Exhibition is intended to promote; and on the\r\n    attractive form which it will be the endeavour of all concerned\r\n    to give to it.\r\n\r\n    \"I cannot doubt but that, under such conditions, should no\r\n    untoward events occur, the project will be more than\r\n    self-sustaining.\r\n\r\n    \"At the same time, it has been thought prudent not to dispense\r\n    with the usual provision of a Guarantee Fund, though I trust no\r\n    circumstances may arise rendering it necessary to make any call\r\n    on the guarantors. To this Fund the Indian and Colonial\r\n    Governments have made liberal contributions, amounting to\r\n    £51,000.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince then gave detailed announcements of the responses made to\r\nappeals addressed to corporations, firms, and individuals in Great\r\nBritain, and in the Colonies and India. He also explained the\r\narrangements for administrative and financial affairs, and for the\r\nreception of foreign representatives.\r\n\r\n    \"In conclusion, let me express the hope that this great\r\n    undertaking, and the many occasions for friendly intercourse\r\n    with our fellow-subjects from India and the Colonies which it\r\n    will afford, may convey to them the assurance that, while we are\r\n    deeply moved by the spirit of patriotism they have lately shown\r\n    in desiring to bear their share in the graver trials of the\r\n    country, we on our part wish to participate in every effort to\r\n    further and develop their material interests--interests which we\r\n    feel to be inseparably bound up with the prosperity of the\r\n    Empire. We must remember that, as regards the Colonies, they are\r\n    the legitimate and natural homes, in future, of the more\r\n    adventurous and energetic portion of the population of these\r\n    Islands. Their progress, and their power of providing all that\r\n    makes life comfortable and attractive, cannot, therefore, but be\r\n    a matter of serious concern to us all. And, as regards India,\r\n    the increasing knowledge of that vast Empire and the rapid and\r\n    easy means of communication to all parts of it which now exist,\r\n    render its remarkable and varied products and its social and\r\n    political condition a source of yearly increasing interest and\r\n    importance to us.\r\n\r\n    \"For the attainment of the purposes I have indicated, I am sure\r\n    I may rely on your friendly co-operation and assistance, in your\r\n    several localities, and within the sphere of your individual\r\n    influence. Although it has been impossible from the pressure of\r\n    their duties elsewhere for some members of the Commission to be\r\n    present at this meeting, I am gratified by the assurance from\r\n    them that we may none the less rely on their practical and\r\n    earnest assistance on every occasion in furthering the work\r\n    which has been entrusted to us, and achieving the important ends\r\n    which I trust may flow from its successful accomplishment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 3rd, 1886._\r\n\r\nA meeting of the Royal Commission was again held on the 3rd of May, in\r\nthe Durbar Hall of the Indian Palace, when the Prince of Wales, as the\r\nExecutive President, addressed the audience. He gave an interesting\r\nreport on all the chief matters that had engaged the attention of the\r\nRoyal Commissioners; and referred to the co-operation received from the\r\nColonies and India. He stated that the guarantee fund had reached the\r\namount of £218,430, of which the City of London had voted £10,000. A\r\nvote of thanks was proposed by the Duke of Cambridge, seconded by Lord\r\nGranville, to the Prince of Wales for the able and energetic manner in\r\nwhich he acted on behalf of the Commission as their President. \"It is\r\nnot the first time that His Royal Highness has acted as President in\r\nundertakings of this nature, and it is very difficult for any individual\r\nto praise him in his presence without appearing fulsome, but it is not\r\nfulsome to say that he has always devoted his whole energies to bringing\r\neverything to a successful issue with which he is connected.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in his reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    He hoped that the Exhibition would be not only entertaining to\r\n    the eye, and that it will prove of material benefit to our own\r\n    countrymen, but that it will also tend to strengthen the bond of\r\n    brotherly love between ourselves and the rest of Her Majesty's\r\n    subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 30th, 1887._\r\n\r\nAt the final meeting of the Royal Commission, held at Marlborough House\r\non the 30th of April, 1887, the minutes of the previous meeting, held on\r\nthe 3rd of May, 1886, having been read, the Prince of Wales addressed\r\nthe meeting:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highness, my Lords and Gentlemen,--I have asked you\r\n    to meet me to-day, in order that I might submit for your\r\n    approval a Report which I have drawn up upon the work of the\r\n    Royal Commission for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, a\r\n    draft of which has already been forwarded to each of you for\r\n    consideration.\r\n\r\n    \"The contents of this Report are so exhaustive, and the\r\n    information afforded so full and complete, that it seems\r\n    scarcely necessary that I should detain you with many\r\n    explanatory remarks.\r\n\r\n    \"You will remember that the last occasion on which I had the\r\n    pleasure of meeting you was on the eve of the opening of the\r\n    Exhibition by Her Majesty the Queen. You are all aware of the\r\n    success of that opening, and you, I am sure, appreciated the\r\n    keen interest which the Queen took in the Exhibition, both by\r\n    performing that imposing ceremony, and by the frequent visits\r\n    which Her Majesty afterwards paid to the various Sections.\r\n\r\n    \"The great importance attached to the objects of this Exhibition\r\n    was evidenced by the striking manner in which it was visited by\r\n    the public. You will have seen by the Report that it was\r\n    attended by no fewer than 5,550,745 persons. Of this number, a\r\n    large proportion were admitted under schemes in which I took a\r\n    deep personal interest, by means of which admission was granted\r\n    to provincial and metropolitan artisans, with their wives and\r\n    families, at greatly reduced rates.\r\n\r\n    \"It may safely be asserted that a vast amount of public good has\r\n    arisen from the holding of this Exhibition. No one can have\r\n    failed to notice the earnest attention paid by all classes of\r\n    the visitors to the contents of the Exhibition; and the\r\n    instruction which was derived from an examination of the varied\r\n    objects displayed therein cannot but tend to a better knowledge\r\n    of the outlying portions of the Empire, among the inhabitants of\r\n    the mother country.\r\n\r\n    \"At a previous Meeting I referred to the appointment of the\r\n    Finance Committee, to its enlargement, and to the manner in\r\n    which its labours were being conducted, and I would now\r\n    specially draw your attention to the Report they have presented\r\n    to me. The accounts now before you, which have been circulated\r\n    for your information, have been subject to a continuous and\r\n    careful audit. They have been made up at the earliest possible\r\n    day consistent with the proper realization of the assets\r\n    belonging to the Royal Commission, and with the settlement of\r\n    the many and varied claims presented after the close of the\r\n    Exhibition, and which the Finance Committee had necessarily to\r\n    adjust. You will see that the fullest information in ample\r\n    detail is given under appropriate heads of the entire receipts\r\n    and expenditure of the Royal Commission up to the 23rd April,\r\n    and I am sure that you will share my satisfaction at the\r\n    gratifying result of a substantial surplus of £35,235 7_s._\r\n    8_d._ remaining in the hands of the Royal Commission.\r\n\r\n    \"I am anxious that the appropriation of this surplus, and the\r\n    objects to which it should be devoted, should be in harmony with\r\n    the wishes of the entire body of the Royal Commission. I desire,\r\n    therefore, to draw your attention to a paragraph in the Report\r\n    of the Finance Committee, to the effect that in view of the fact\r\n    that this Exhibition, and those which preceded it, have to a\r\n    certain extent been considered as one series, consideration\r\n    might be given to the requirements of any former Exhibition, the\r\n    financial results of which have been less satisfactory than\r\n    those of the present undertaking. In this recommendation I\r\n    entirely concur, and a Resolution in that sense will be\r\n    submitted for your approval.\r\n\r\n    \"I would also suggest to you the advisability of retaining for\r\n    the present a certain sum for the purpose of meeting any\r\n    unforeseen contingencies; which sum should for the next few\r\n    years remain vested in the names of trustees, but should\r\n    ultimately be applied to the same purpose as that to which the\r\n    residue is devoted.\r\n\r\n    \"As regards the balance of the surplus, I would commend to your\r\n    consideration the propriety of transferring it to the funds of\r\n    the Imperial Institute of the United Kingdom, the Colonies, and\r\n    India (in the promotion of which the Queen and I both take so\r\n    warm an interest), the more especially as we may regard the\r\n    Institute, to a certain extent, as the outcome of the Exhibition\r\n    which was closed in November last.\r\n\r\n    \"Before moving resolutions to this effect, I would wish to\r\n    express to you my deep gratitude for the support which you have\r\n    at all times given to me in the duties which I, as your\r\n    Executive President, have had so much pleasure in performing;\r\n    and I am sure you will join with me at this our last Meeting in\r\n    expressing most heartily our appreciation of the co-operation\r\n    which the Royal Commission received from the Colonies and India,\r\n    and of the exertions of the gentlemen representing these\r\n    Governments, which tended in so marked a degree to the success\r\n    of the past Exhibition.\r\n\r\n    \"The enthusiastic manner in which the proposal for holding this\r\n    Exhibition was received in all portions of Her Majesty's Empire,\r\n    the energy displayed in realising the views of the Royal\r\n    Commission, and the continued support rendered to us by the\r\n    Colonial and Indian Governments and their representatives in\r\n    London, resulted in the achievement of a work of which all those\r\n    who participated in it may be justly proud, and which formed a\r\n    fitting prelude to an undertaking intended to commemorate the\r\n    Jubilee of Her Majesty's reign, by permanently gathering\r\n    together in one building the varied productions of the whole of\r\n    the British Empire, in the interchange of which its past\r\n    prosperity is so much due, and by which its future development\r\n    may be promoted.\r\n\r\n    \"In closing these observations, I would desire to convey to the\r\n    gentlemen composing the Finance Committee, my warm personal\r\n    acknowledgments for their unremitting attention, and the great\r\n    services they have rendered, at so much sacrifice to their time\r\n    and convenience. I equally desire to acknowledge the admirable\r\n    and efficient arrangements made throughout by the Executive\r\n    Secretary, and to return my thanks to the whole staff employed\r\n    on the Exhibition. Their zeal and readiness at all times to\r\n    promote its success demand special recognition at our hands. In\r\n    all this, I feel assured I give expression to the sentiments of\r\n    every member of the Royal Commission.\"\r\n\r\nIn the speeches of those who moved and seconded the resolutions\r\nsubmitted to the meeting, reference was repeatedly made to the permanent\r\nImperial Institute, of which the Indo-Colonial Exhibition seemed the\r\nprecursor. The Prince, in acknowledging the vote of thanks at the\r\nconclusion of the meeting, said:--\"I most truly hope that the words\r\nwhich fell from Lord Derby and Lord Kimberley with respect to the\r\nImperial Institute may come true. If I may use the allegory, now that we\r\nhave, as it were, burnt the late Exhibition to-day, I hope the Imperial\r\nInstitute may be a Phoenix arising out of its ashes. I trust that it\r\nmay be a lasting memorial, not only of that but of the Jubilee of Her\r\nMajesty the Queen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition was opened by Her Majesty on the 4th of May, and those\r\nwho were present will not readily forget the impressive nature of the\r\nproceedings on that memorable day. The Official Report of the Royal\r\nCommission (printed and published, as all the Exhibition Reports have\r\nbeen, by W. Clowes & Sons) is a most valuable manual on all matters\r\nrelating to the Exhibition--the most imposing and interesting of any\r\nsince that of 1851. It was also the most successful as to finance, there\r\nbeing a surplus of no less than £35,285 7_s._ 8_d._ Of this £25,000 was\r\nvoted to the Imperial Institute fund, and the remainder applied to\r\nliquidate the debt remaining from the Inventions Exhibition, and the\r\nformation of a reserve fund connected with other Exhibitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE.\r\n\r\n_January 12th, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Institute, while it will be the grandest and most enduring\r\nmemorial of the Queen's Jubilee, will also be associated in history with\r\nthe name of the Prince of Wales. It was by him that the idea was first\r\nentertained, and the proposal first made; and to his zealous and\r\npersevering efforts the successful carrying out of the project is due.\r\nThere had been various circumstances preparing this way for the great\r\nundertaking, but it was the success of the Indo-Colonial Exhibition,\r\nheld in 1886, that led to the proposal of a permanent Imperial\r\nInstitute. It would be a visible emblem of the unity of the Empire, and\r\na place for illustrating its vast resources; a museum for exhibiting its\r\nmanifold products and industries; a centre of information and\r\ncommunication for all the countries throughout the world under the\r\nBritish sovereignty; and be helpful to the increase and the distribution\r\nof the wealth of the nation. It would co-operate and not conflict with\r\nolder institutions of tried utility, such as Colonial museums and\r\nexchanges, emigration societies, technical colleges, and other\r\norganizations for the welfare of the people. The scheme was worthy of\r\nbeing adopted as a national memorial of the Jubilee of the Queen's\r\nreign, and was fittingly inaugurated by the heir apparent to the throne.\r\n\r\nOf the progress of the movement, and of the home for the Institute at\r\nSouth Kensington, it is not necessary here to speak, but the following\r\nspeech of the Prince of Wales, at St. James's Palace, on the 12th of\r\nJanuary, 1887, gives the best summary of all that is designed and\r\nexpected in regard to the Imperial Institute.\r\n\r\nLetters had been sent out inviting many influential persons to meet His\r\nRoyal Highness as chairman, and the members of the organizing committee\r\nof the Institute. The banqueting room at the old Palace was filled with\r\nan audience such as has rarely been brought together on any occasion in\r\nrecent years. Many of the most distinguished men in all departments of\r\npublic life, the Lord Mayors of London and York, with nearly 200 Mayors,\r\nProvosts, and Chief Magistrates of English and Scottish boroughs,\r\nMasters and Wardens of City Companies, and Directors of great corporate\r\nbodies and societies were present. The Prince of Wales, on entering the\r\nroom, accompanied by Prince Albert Victor, was warmly received; and thus\r\nhe addressed the meeting:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--You are doubtless aware of the general\r\n    feeling on the part of the public that some signal proof of the\r\n    love and loyalty of Her Majesty's subjects throughout her widely\r\n    extended Empire should be given to the Queen when she celebrates\r\n    the fiftieth year of her happy reign. In order to afford to the\r\n    Queen the fullest satisfaction, the proposed memorial should not\r\n    be merely personal in its character, but should tend to serve\r\n    the interests of the entire Empire and to promote a feeling of\r\n    unity among the whole of Her Majesty's subjects. The desire to\r\n    find fitting means of drawing our colonies and India into closer\r\n    bonds with the mother country, a desire which of late has been\r\n    clearly expressed, meets, I am sure, with the Queen's warmest\r\n    sympathy. It occurred to me that the recent Colonial and Indian\r\n    Exhibition, which presented a most successful display of the\r\n    material resources of the colonies and India, might suggest the\r\n    basis for an institute which should afford a permanent\r\n    representation of the products and manufactures of the whole of\r\n    the Queen's dominions. I therefore appointed a committee of\r\n    eminent men to consider and report to me upon the best means of\r\n    carrying out this idea.\r\n\r\n    \"Upon the report of the committee being submitted to me, and\r\n    after giving every clause my full consideration, it so entirely\r\n    met with my approval that I accepted all its suggestions, and I\r\n    therefore directed that a copy of that report should be sent to\r\n    each of you. As I trust you have mastered the suggestions of\r\n    that report, I do not purpose re-stating them to you in detail,\r\n    but I would remind you that I propose that the memorial should\r\n    bear the name of the Imperial Institute of the United Kingdom,\r\n    the Colonies, and India, and that it must find its home within\r\n    buildings of a character worthy to commemorate the Jubilee year\r\n    of the Queen's reign.\r\n\r\n    \"My proposals also are that the Imperial Institute should be an\r\n    emblem of the unity of the Empire, and should illustrate the\r\n    resources and capabilities of every section of her Majesty's\r\n    dominions. By these means every one may become acquainted with\r\n    the marvellous growth of the Queen's colonial and Indian\r\n    possessions during her reign, and will be enabled to mark by the\r\n    opportunities afforded for contrast how steadily these\r\n    possessions have advanced in manufacturing skill and enterprise\r\n    step by step with the mother country. A representative institute\r\n    of this kind must necessarily be situated in London, but its\r\n    organization will, I trust, be such that benefits will be\r\n    equally conferred upon our provincial communities as well as\r\n    upon the colonial and Indian subjects of the Crown. It is my\r\n    hope that the institute will form a practical means of\r\n    communication between our colonial settlers and those persons at\r\n    home who may benefit by emigration. Much information and even\r\n    instruction may beneficially be imparted to those who need\r\n    guidance in respect to emigration.\r\n\r\n    \"You are aware that the competition of industry all over the\r\n    world has become keen, while commerce and manufactures have been\r\n    profoundly affected by the recent rapid progress of science and\r\n    the increased facilities of inter-communication offered by steam\r\n    and the electric telegraph. In consequence of these changes all\r\n    nations are using strenuous efforts to produce a trained\r\n    intelligence among their people. The working classes of this\r\n    country have not been slow to show their desire for improvement\r\n    in this direction. They wish to place themselves in a position\r\n    of intellectual power by using all opportunities offered to them\r\n    to secure an understanding of the principles as well as of the\r\n    practice of the work in which they are engaged. No less than\r\n    16,000,000 persons from all parts of the kingdom have attended\r\n    the four exhibitions over which I presided, representing\r\n    fisheries, public health, inventions, and the colonies and\r\n    India, and I assure you I would not have undertaken the labour\r\n    attending their administration had I not felt a deep conviction\r\n    that such exhibitions added to the knowledge of the people and\r\n    stimulated the industries of the country.\r\n\r\n    \"I have on more than one occasion expressed my own views,\r\n    founded upon those so often enunciated by my lamented father,\r\n    that it is of the greatest importance to do everything within\r\n    our power to advance the knowledge as well as the practical\r\n    skill of the productive classes of the Empire. I therefore\r\n    commend to you as the leading idea I entertain that the\r\n    institute should be regarded as a centre for extending knowledge\r\n    in relation to the industrial resources and commerce of the\r\n    Queen's dominions. With this view it should be in constant\r\n    touch, not only with the chief manufacturing districts of this\r\n    country, but also with all the colonies and India. Such objects\r\n    are large in their scope, and must necessarily be so, if this\r\n    institute is worthily to represent the unity of the Empire.\r\n\r\n    \"To some minds the scheme may not be sufficiently comprehensive,\r\n    because it does not provide for systematic courses of technical\r\n    instruction in connection with the collections and libraries of\r\n    the proposed institute. I would be the last person to undervalue\r\n    this suggestion. I am well aware that the advantages we have\r\n    enjoyed in the competition of the world by the possession of\r\n    fuel, combined with large mineral resources and by the maritime\r\n    habits of our people, are now becoming of less importance, as\r\n    trained intellect has in other countries been more and more\r\n    applied to productive industry. But I know that this truth has\r\n    already penetrated our centres of manufacturing activity, for\r\n    many of the large towns have founded colleges and schools of\r\n    science and art to increase the intellectual factor of\r\n    production. London, also, has taken important steps in the same\r\n    direction. The Imperial Institute should be a supplement to, and\r\n    not a competitor with, other institutions for technical\r\n    education in science and art both at home and in the colonies.\r\n    At the same time, I trust that the institute will be able to\r\n    stimulate and aid local efforts by directing scholarships for\r\n    the working-classes into suitable channels, and by other similar\r\n    means.\r\n\r\n    \"Though the institute does not engage in the direct object of\r\n    systematic technical education, it may well be the means of\r\n    promoting it, as its purpose is to extend an exact knowledge of\r\n    the industrial resources of the Empire. It will be a place of\r\n    study and resort for producers and consumers from the colonies\r\n    and India when they visit this country for business or pleasure,\r\n    and they, as well as the merchants and manufacturers of the\r\n    United Kingdom, will find in its collections, libraries,\r\n    conference and intelligence rooms, the means of extending the\r\n    commerce and of improving the manufacturing industries of the\r\n    Empire. I trust, too, that colonial and Indian subjects visiting\r\n    this country will find some sort of social welcome within the\r\n    proposed building. This institute will thus be an emblem, as\r\n    well as a practical exponent, of the community of interests and\r\n    the unity of feeling throughout the extended dominions of the\r\n    Queen.\r\n\r\n    \"From the close relation in which I stand to the Queen, there\r\n    can be no impropriety in my stating that if her subjects desire,\r\n    on the occasion of the celebration of her fiftieth year as\r\n    Sovereign of this great Empire, to offer her a memorial of their\r\n    love and loyalty, she would specially value one which would\r\n    promote the industrial and commercial resources of her dominions\r\n    in various parts of the world, and which would be expressive of\r\n    that unity and co-operation which Her Majesty desires should\r\n    prevail among all classes and races of her extended Empire.\r\n\r\n    \"My lords and gentlemen, I have invited you to meet on this\r\n    occasion in order that I may appeal to you to give me your\r\n    assistance in establishing and maintaining the Imperial\r\n    Institute. If you approve of the views I have expressed, I am\r\n    certain I may rely upon your strenuous co-operation to carry\r\n    them into effect. I admit that it has not been without anxiety\r\n    that I resolved to make the propositions I submitted to you, but\r\n    confidence and support have come to me in the knowledge that I\r\n    can appeal to you, and through you to the whole country, to give\r\n    your aid to a work which I believe will be of lasting benefit to\r\n    this and future generations.\"\r\n\r\nResolutions were proposed and speeches made by Earl Spencer, the Lord\r\nProvost of Edinburgh, Viscount Hampden, the Lord Mayor of London, the\r\nMayor of Newcastle, and the Marquis of Lorne, approving the scheme, and\r\npromising hearty support. The Lord Mayor proposed a vote of thanks to\r\nthe Prince, who tendered his thanks for the attendance at the meeting,\r\nand the approval given to the proposal.\r\n\r\n    \"I am glad, gentlemen, to have this opportunity of expressing to\r\n    you collectively and individually my deep feelings of gratitude,\r\n    in seeing you all here to-day at a time of year when travelling\r\n    is neither easy nor pleasant, considering the distances which\r\n    you have had to come; and also for the kind response which you\r\n    have made to my appeal. It augurs well for the future, and I\r\n    feel convinced you will do all in your power to assist me in\r\n    making this Imperial Institute worthy of the name of our Queen\r\n    and of her Empire. The promotion of this scheme is with me a\r\n    labour of love, and it must, I am sure, strike you all that,\r\n    apart from wishing to do honour to the name of my beloved\r\n    mother, nobody is more desirous than I am that a monument, if I\r\n    may use the term, may be erected worthy of her Empire.\"\r\n\r\nA public meeting was held the same day at the Mansion House, attended by\r\na large number of the most influential men in the City. The Lord Mayor\r\n(Sir Reginald Hanson), Earl Granville, Mr. Plunket, M.P., Mr. Mundella,\r\nM.P., Mr. Goschen, M.P., and Lord Rothschild, were among the speakers,\r\nand resolutions were passed with an enthusiasm which gave good augury\r\nfor the success of the Imperial Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON ORPHAN ASYLUM.\r\n\r\n_March 12th, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Orphan Asylum, for the maintenance, clothing, and education\r\nof Fatherless Children, is one of the oldest and best charities of its\r\nclass. The Prince of Wales presided at the Jubilee Festival, at the\r\nHôtel Métropole, on the 12th of March, 1887. Among the numerous friends\r\nof the charity present were the Duke of Abercorn, the Earl of Clarendon,\r\nSir Donald Stewart, Sir Dighton Probyn, and many distinguished men. The\r\nPrince, in giving the toast of \"The Queen,\" said it was the first public\r\ndinner at which he had presided in the Jubilee year of the Queen, and\r\nthis was also the jubilee of her connection with the London Orphan\r\nAsylum, of which she had been for fifty years its patron. The toast was\r\nreceived with more than usual enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAlderman Sir R. N. Fowler, M.P., in giving the next loyal toast said\r\nthat the charity had been already deeply indebted to the Prince of\r\nWales, who had, along with the Princess of Wales, laid the foundation\r\nstone of this Asylum at Watford.\r\n\r\nOther loyal and patriotic toasts having been given, the Prince rose to\r\npropose the toast of the evening. He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--The London Orphan Asylum is an old\r\n    institution; it was founded in 1813, two years before the battle\r\n    of Waterloo; and it owed its origin to a distinguished\r\n    philanthropist of the time, Dr. Andrew Reed. Of course it began\r\n    on a very small scale, for the old proverb applied in this as in\r\n    so many other cases that you must cut your coat according to\r\n    your cloth. It commenced in the first year of its organization\r\n    with only three children; but in 1822 there were as many as 126\r\n    children in the school. Twenty years later there were as many as\r\n    326; twenty years later still there were 414; and now it affords\r\n    me the greatest pleasure to announce to you that we have upwards\r\n    of 500 children.\r\n\r\n    \"The first subscription list contained the names of 255\r\n    subscribers, and among them was my grandfather. He was the first\r\n    patron and headed the list with 50 guineas; and in 1823 my\r\n    grand-uncle, the late Duke of York, laid the foundation stone of\r\n    the institution at Clapton; while two years later the late Duke\r\n    of Cambridge, who was always foremost in all great charitable\r\n    undertakings in this country, presided at its annual festival.\r\n    The institution continued to grow and more children had to be\r\n    admitted, until at last there was not sufficient room in the old\r\n    home. A new one was, therefore, instituted at Watford, and in\r\n    1869 the Princess and myself were asked to lay the foundation\r\n    stone of your present home. Having taken part in that ceremony,\r\n    it gives me much gratification to learn in what a flourishing\r\n    condition the institution now is, which is exemplified by the\r\n    presence of upwards of 500 in the home. And when I look at the\r\n    young ladies and the boys before us I think you will come to the\r\n    conclusion that the management of the institution is thoroughly\r\n    good. During the 74 years of the existence of the asylum\r\n    something over 5000 orphan children have been maintained,\r\n    clothed, and educated.\r\n\r\n    \"The great Duke of Wellington took very great interest in the\r\n    institution, and I believe I am not wrong in stating that he\r\n    presided at its festivals on five different occasions. A\r\n    remarkable and very important fact in connection with the\r\n    institution is that those who have received education and aid\r\n    from the society are those who do all they can to give it\r\n    support at the present time, and part of the institution at\r\n    Watford was built by subscriptions of the old scholars, and I am\r\n    told that there are as many as ten old pupils of the institution\r\n    in one commercial house in the City, while many are present here\r\n    to-night who are prepared to give liberal donations. The\r\n    education they receive is a thoroughly sound and practical one,\r\n    and when they leave every effort is made to find them\r\n    situations, and they are sent out with proper clothing. As a\r\n    proof that it is managed on economical principles I need only\r\n    say that the cost per head in the past year amounted to little\r\n    over £30. The amount disbursed in the 74 years since its\r\n    foundation has reached the large sum of £700,000--all of this\r\n    large sum, with the exception of £1000 a year which you can rely\r\n    upon, having been derived from voluntary contributions.\r\n\r\n    \"This year being the Jubilee of Her Majesty's reign the managers\r\n    are most anxious to mark the epoch in some manner which will\r\n    benefit the institution, and they have resolved to add 100\r\n    scholars, of whom 50 were admitted in January and 50 more will\r\n    be admitted in June. The cost of this will, undoubtedly, be very\r\n    great, the ultimate amount being between £18,000 and £20,000. I\r\n    am here, therefore, as your chairman, to ask you to contribute\r\n    as liberally as you can for the maintenance of this ancient and\r\n    most creditable institution. I am well aware that now and for\r\n    some years past there has been both agricultural and commercial\r\n    depression, but I feel convinced that in the cause of\r\n    charity--and what greater charity can there be than providing\r\n    for orphan children?--I shall not appeal in vain to my\r\n    countrymen to do all in their power as philanthropists to\r\n    support an institution which has been carried out on the best\r\n    and most economical principles.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with much enthusiasm, and acknowledged by Mr. Capell\r\n(the treasurer). The total amount of the subscriptions announced during\r\nthe evening was £5000, including an annual subscription of 20 guineas\r\nfrom the Queen and 100 guineas from the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nWhen the foundation-stone was laid by the Prince and Princess of Wales,\r\nin 1869, 250 purses were laid on it, containing in all about £8000. For\r\nthe chapel £5000 was given by one whose early days were spent in the\r\nAsylum. The Grocers' Company contributed £3000 to build one house; the\r\nCountess of Verulam and the Countess of Essex raised another sum of\r\n£3000, as a kind of welcome to the county. The income in 1887 was\r\n£15,000, but the invested funds give little more than £1000, so that\r\nthere is constant need of new \"voluntary contributions,\" to maintain the\r\n550 orphans now in the houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLEGE OF PRECEPTORS.\r\n\r\n_March 30th, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe associated teachers who, under the name of the College of\r\nPreceptors, have for above forty years laboured to raise the standard of\r\nmiddle-class education, deserve praise and honour for what they have\r\naccomplished. Without Government aid or grant, and unpatronized by\r\ndignitaries of Church or State, these learned and patriotic men have\r\nsucceeded, by training teachers, establishing examinations, and granting\r\ncertificates, in acquiring a reputation and influence now very generally\r\nrecognized. Their work is truly of national importance, and this His\r\nRoyal Highness the Prince of Wales declared when he readily assented to\r\nformally open the new building of the College, in Bloomsbury Square, on\r\nthe 30th of March, 1887. This College is self-supporting, and the cost\r\nof the erection and equipment of the new building was defrayed out of\r\nsavings that had accumulated in the hands of the treasurer during the\r\nprevious seven years.\r\n\r\nA very large number of persons interested in education assembled in the\r\nlecture-hall to witness the ceremony, among whom were Sir Lyon Playfair,\r\nSir Richard Temple, Mr. Lyulph Stanley, the Dowager Lady Stanley of\r\nAlderley, the Presidents of several societies, and the Head Masters of\r\nHarrow, Charterhouse, and Merchant Taylors' Schools, of Marlborough and\r\nDulwich Colleges, and of Christ's Hospital.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the Prince of Wales, accompanied by the Princess of\r\nWales, and their daughters Princesses Victoria and Maud, an address was\r\npresented by the Rev. Dr. T. W. Jex-Blake, President of the Council. The\r\nPrince, in replying, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dr. Jex-Blake, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--It gives the Princess of\r\n    Wales and myself great satisfaction to have been able to accede\r\n    to the request of the council, and to open the new building of\r\n    the College of Preceptors. I am reminded, by your reference to\r\n    the circumstances that this building is opened during the year\r\n    of the Queen's jubilee, of the many and important improvements\r\n    that have taken place in Her Majesty's dominions during the last\r\n    fifty years, and especially in the advancement of education\r\n    among all classes of the people, a share of which progress is\r\n    due to the excellent work undertaken by this self-supported\r\n    institution.\r\n\r\n    \"For over forty years the College of Preceptors has exercised a\r\n    marked and growing influence for good upon the education given\r\n    in some of our endowed schools, and more particularly in the\r\n    numerous private schools for boys and girls which are an\r\n    important feature in the educational system of this country. The\r\n    value of your work is sufficiently shown by the high reputation\r\n    of your examinations and by the constantly increasing number of\r\n    your candidates, and I sincerely congratulate you on the results\r\n    you have achieved. In the further development of the work of\r\n    training teachers you have before you a future of great\r\n    usefulness, for there can be no doubt that the provision of\r\n    properly-trained teachers for middle and higher schools is\r\n    almost, if not quite, as necessary as for our public elementary\r\n    schools.\r\n\r\n    \"The key of the building which you have presented to me I shall\r\n    retain as a memento of this ceremony, and in declaring this\r\n    building open I fervently hope that the influence and teaching\r\n    which will go forth from it may tend to improve and to raise to\r\n    a yet higher standard the education given in the private and\r\n    secondary schools of our country. I declare this building now\r\n    open.\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal party were afterwards conducted through the building, the\r\narrangements of which are justly admired. The entrance corridor is wide\r\nand lofty. On one side of it there is a club-room for members, and on\r\nthe other the secretary's and clerks' offices. The council-room is large\r\nand handsome, and the lecture-room occupies the whole of the second\r\nstory, and is surrounded by book-cases capable of holding 10,000\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANCHESTER EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n_May 3rd, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Exhibition at Manchester during the Queen's Jubilee year is\r\ntoo recent an event to need any remark prefatory to the statement that\r\nit was opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales on the 3rd of May,\r\n1887. Their Royal Highnesses, who were guests at Tatton Hall, drove with\r\nLord Egerton through the park to Knutsford, where they stopped to\r\nwitness the crowning of the May Queen, and other old English May Day\r\ncustoms which have been revived in that quaint little town. The Prince\r\ngave the permission asked by the Committee to add the title of Royal to\r\nthe Knutsford May Day Sports. They then travelled in a saloon carriage\r\nto Manchester, accompanied by Lady Sefton and Lord Egerton.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the Town Hall an address was presented, to which the\r\nPrince read the following reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"It gives me sincere pleasure to be permitted on behalf of the\r\n    Queen, my dear mother, to visit the city of Manchester for the\r\n    purpose of opening the extensive and interesting Exhibition\r\n    which the inhabitants of Manchester have organized with such\r\n    admirable zeal and energy, particularly as it is associated with\r\n    your congratulations on Her Majesty's attaining the fiftieth\r\n    year of her reign. In her name I thank you for your loyal and\r\n    dutiful address. It has been a source of much gratification to\r\n    the Queen to receive assurance of unfaltering attachment to her\r\n    throne and person from all parts of the Empire on the occasion.\r\n    The Princess of Wales and I desire to express our admiration of\r\n    the noble building which you have provided for the conduct of\r\n    your municipal affairs, and we think it worthy of the vast\r\n    wealth and importance of the city of Manchester. It gives us\r\n    great satisfaction to be able to promote and encourage all\r\n    charitable works and institutions designed for the social and\r\n    educational improvement of the community. We thank you for your\r\n    good wishes for the welfare of ourselves and our children, and\r\n    we hope that prosperity and happiness may ever attend on the\r\n    labours of the loyal and industrious inhabitants of this great\r\n    city.\"\r\n\r\nThe route of the procession from the Town Hall to the Exhibition was a\r\nvery long one, being chosen by the Prince in preference to a shorter one\r\nsubmitted to him, on the ground that he would rather afford pleasure to\r\na larger number of people than see the finer edifices on the shorter\r\nroute. In the Palm House of the gardens luncheon was served, and then\r\nthe opening ceremony took place in the nave of the building, in the\r\nposition known as the Music Room. Mr. Hallé's orchestra was in front of\r\nthe organ, and the National Anthem was performed with fine effect, the\r\nvocal rendering being also given by Madame Albani and the full chorus.\r\nThe Bishop of Manchester offered prayer, and the choir sang the Old\r\nHundredth Psalm. To the address read by Sir Joseph Lee, the Prince\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n    \"I receive with great satisfaction your address on the opening\r\n    of this large and instructive Exhibition. On behalf of Her\r\n    Majesty I declare it open from this day. The illustrations\r\n    which you have collected on engineering and chemical industry,\r\n    and the products of manufacture and useful toil, afford ample\r\n    testimony to the skill and ingenuity and steady perseverance of\r\n    the inhabitants of this district, and prove how justly they hold\r\n    a high and an honourable place in the industrial ranks of the\r\n    Empire. The collection of natural products and manufactures of\r\n    Ireland, and the gratifying display of English works of art, add\r\n    much to the interest and value of this Exhibition, in which I\r\n    recognise a worthy mark of your desire to do honour to an\r\n    occasion so auspicious as the celebration of the fiftieth year\r\n    of Her Majesty's reign. The Princess and I desire to thank you\r\n    heartily for your good wishes on our behalf, and for the cordial\r\n    welcome which you have given us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in the name of the Queen, declared the Exhibition open. A\r\nfanfare of trumpets was then given and a _feu de joie_ fired. The\r\nproceedings closed with a procession through the different departments,\r\nwhile the \"Lobgesang\" or \"Hymn of Praise\" was rendered by the full\r\norchestra and chorus. At the Exhibition station a special train was\r\nwaiting to take the Royal party back to Tatton Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON HOSPITAL NEW BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\n_May 22nd, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Hospital has many and special claims on public sympathy and\r\nsupport. Its position, in Whitechapel, surrounded by poor and crowded\r\nparts of East London; its small endowments compared with some of the\r\nother great hospitals; the vast number of patients annually relieved,\r\nboth in the house and as out-patients; and its being virtually a \"free\"\r\nhospital, nearly three-fourths of the in-patients being received without\r\nletter or recommendation; all these circumstances appeal to liberal\r\ncharity. In 1887 there were 8863 in-patients admitted, of which 6019\r\nwere freely received, without letters of subscribers. There are\r\nchildren's wards where, during the same time, 1717 were admitted; and\r\nHebrew wards, where 623 received treatment. The total number of\r\nout-patients, treated either at the Hospital or at their homes, was\r\nnearly 100,000, including relief given in less serious and protracted\r\nillness. The income from endowments is little more than £15,000 a year,\r\nwhile the annual cost of maintenance is £50,000. The Medical School is\r\nsupported by the fees of pupils, but for the general maintenance of the\r\nHospital appeal must be made to the public for voluntary subscriptions\r\nand contributions.\r\n\r\nA Nursing Home, to accommodate 100 nurses, a new Library, and other\r\nbuildings having been recently added, the Prince and Princess of Wales\r\nwere invited by the Governors, of whom the Duke of Cambridge is\r\nPresident, to inaugurate these additions to the institution. This was\r\ndone, with suitable ceremony, on Saturday, the 21st of May, 1887. The\r\nPrincesses Louise and Victoria of Wales, and the Crown Prince of Denmark\r\nwere also present. The Governors and officers of the Hospital, with many\r\ndistinguished persons, were in attendance, and great interest was shown\r\nby the crowds of people who thronged the streets on the occasion. The\r\nRoyal party visited several of the wards, where the Princess of Wales\r\nshowed kindly sympathy with many of the poor patients, especially in the\r\nchildren's wards. On arriving at the dining-hall of the nurses and\r\nsisters, who wear a plain and tasteful uniform, a hymn was sung, and a\r\nprayer offered by the Bishop of Bedford, after which, at the request of\r\nthe Duke of Cambridge, the Princess of Wales formally declared the\r\nNursing Home to be open.\r\n\r\nThe Medical College was then visited, and in the new library an address\r\nwas presented by the President. The Prince of Wales, in acknowledging\r\nthe address, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highness and Gentlemen,--The Princess and myself\r\n    thank you for your address, and can assure you that we have much\r\n    pleasure in coming here to-day to open the nursing home and\r\n    college buildings of this important institution. The Hospital,\r\n    which is the largest civil one in the United Kingdom, which\r\n    contains 800 beds and which supplied medical and surgical\r\n    assistance to 80,000 out-patients last year, may be regarded\r\n    almost in the light of a national institution, as every\r\n    description of case, excepting those of an infectious or\r\n    incurable nature, is admitted. Such a Hospital cannot fail to be\r\n    of inestimable value to the population of over a million persons\r\n    residing in its vicinity, and especially to the labouring class,\r\n    who are so extensively employed in connection with the railways\r\n    and docks. But it has other and additional claims upon public\r\n    sympathy and assistance. First, although its annual expenditure\r\n    amounts to nearly £50,000, it is mainly supported by voluntary\r\n    contributions; secondly, it has undertaken the difficult task of\r\n    improving the system of nursing and of providing a higher class\r\n    of nurses, with better discipline and superior training and\r\n    instruction. To effect this object house accommodation was\r\n    essential, and instead of closely-packed dormitories the new\r\n    home provides separate rooms, a cheerful dining hall, and other\r\n    advantages, all tending to brighten the lives of the inmates,\r\n    while reserving for them the necessary quiet and rest.\r\n\r\n    \"The new library and buildings which I am now about to declare\r\n    open belong to a college over 100 years old. It was the first in\r\n    the Metropolis in which a complete curriculum was established,\r\n    and being attached to the largest Hospital in the country, and\r\n    situated in the midst of the most populous artisan neighbourhood\r\n    in London, it offers greater facilities for the acquirement of\r\n    medical and surgical knowledge than perhaps any other college of\r\n    a scientific character. I understand that among the important\r\n    duties which the students perform are those of dressers,\r\n    clinical clerks, maternity pupils, and other assistants, and\r\n    from their number the resident officers are selected after\r\n    having become qualified practitioners. The Princess and I most\r\n    earnestly pray that every blessing may attend the labours and\r\n    efforts of all those who are working among the sufferers in the\r\n    Hospital, and you may rest assured that we shall always take the\r\n    warmest interest in the welfare and prosperity of your noble\r\n    institution.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Langdon Down, the senior physician, in thanking His Royal Highness\r\non behalf of his colleagues and the students, explained that the new\r\nbuildings did not diminish the funds of the Hospital, as a rent was paid\r\nfor them by the teaching staff of the medical school. The Prince then\r\ndeclared the new buildings and the library to be open. The Duke of\r\nCambridge then called for three cheers for the Prince and Princess,\r\nwhich were given with great heartiness, followed by \"one cheer more for\r\nthe Duke,\" who has always been a zealous and generous friend of the\r\nLondon Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEACONESSES' INSTITUTION AND HOSPITAL AT TOTTENHAM.\r\n\r\n_May 28th, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the Deaconesses' Institution at Tottenham is \"the training\r\nof Christian women to serve as deaconesses\"--that is to say, as sisters\r\ntrained for working, teaching, and nursing, without being subject to any\r\nobligation or vow of celibacy, as is usual in the sisterhoods of Roman\r\nCatholic communities. The training of nurses is one of the chief\r\npurposes sought, following in this the example of the celebrated\r\ninstitution of Kaiserwerth, where, under Pastor Fliedner, Florence\r\nNightingale and other English as well as German nurses were trained. In\r\nfact the full title of the establishment at the Green, Tottenham, is the\r\n\"Evangelical Protestant Deaconesses' Institution and Training Hospital.\"\r\nThe Hospital contains 100 beds for the sick poor, and there are also a\r\nfew private rooms for paying patients. Thousands of the poor are also\r\nattended every year in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the work, in 1867, the late Samuel Morley,\r\nM.P., took warm interest in it, and at his death two of his sons, Howard\r\nand Charles Morley, erected a new wing to the building, as a memorial of\r\ntheir father. It was to open the \"Samuel Morley\" memorial wing that the\r\nPrincess of Wales, accompanied by the Prince and their three daughters,\r\nvisited Tottenham on the 29th of May, 1887. A large number of persons\r\nwere assembled, including deputations from foreign countries, Pastor\r\nFliedner from Kaiserwerth, Pastor Nehmitz from Berlin, and other\r\nPastors, Lady Superintendents, and Deaconesses from German and Danish\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nWhen the Royal party had been conducted to the marquee where the\r\nceremony was to take place an address was read to the Princess of Wales\r\nby Dr. Laseron, the medical director. The Prince, in replying on behalf\r\nof the Princess, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dr. Laseron, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--The Princess of Wales\r\n    desires me to express her sincerest thanks for the address which\r\n    has just been read to her, and to express to all who take an\r\n    interest in this institution the great pleasure and\r\n    gratification it affords her to take part in to-day's\r\n    proceedings. There can be, I am sure, nothing more noble or more\r\n    praiseworthy than an institution like this, in which women give\r\n    up their lives to the object of philanthropy in order to heal\r\n    and mitigate the sufferings of the sick. An institution like the\r\n    Deaconesses' Institution is one well worthy of the support of\r\n    all. I am sure that the proceeding of to-day, in opening a\r\n    fresh wing of this hospital, is a sincere gratification to the\r\n    Princess, and especially that it should be called after the name\r\n    of one whom I have had the privilege of knowing, and whom you\r\n    all knew, at any rate by name, and whose loss we must all deeply\r\n    deplore--the late Samuel Morley. I am sure no more fitting name\r\n    could be given to the new wing than that it should be called\r\n    after him who, with the members of his family--one of whom I am\r\n    glad to see here to-day--has contributed so much to the\r\n    prosperity of this institution. In the name of the Princess I\r\n    beg to express to you the pleasure it gives us to be present\r\n    here to-day.\"\r\n\r\nPurses were then presented to the Princess by many girls, as gifts to\r\nthe funds, and Dr. Laseron handed to her Royal Highness a key to unlock\r\nthe new wing. The Royal party were then conducted to the hall, where the\r\nPrincess unveiled the \"Samuel Morley Tablet,\" bearing an inscription\r\ncommemorative of the occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREEMASONS AND THE QUEEN'S JUBILEE.\r\n\r\n_June 13th, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\nHer Gracious Majesty being the chief patroness of the Order of\r\nFreemasons, and of the Masonic charities, it was deemed fitting that an\r\naddress should be presented to her on the occasion of her Jubilee.\r\nAccordingly, the Prince of Wales, with the Duke of Connaught and Prince\r\nAlbert Victor, and a vast company of officers and members of the Order,\r\nrepresentatives chosen by lodges in different parts of the empire,\r\nassembled in the Royal Albert Hall on the 13th of June, 1887. The number\r\npresent was about 7000. No such scene has been witnessed since that day,\r\ntwelve years before, when the Prince was installed as Grand Master of\r\nEnglish Freemasons. The procession which received the Grand Master and\r\nconducted him to the throne was a magnificent affair. The assemblage, we\r\nare told, although \"tyled,\" was not held as a lodge. The business of the\r\nmeeting being opened, his Royal Highness the Grand Master said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Brethren,--This is, I think, one of the greatest gatherings of\r\n    Freemasons I have ever seen, with the exception of the occasion\r\n    when, after election by the craft, I received the honour of\r\n    installation as your Grand Master. It is most gratifying to me,\r\n    as I feel sure it will be to the Queen, that so large a\r\n    gathering has assembled here to-day to do her honour on the\r\n    fiftieth anniversary of her reign--the Jubilee of her accession.\r\n    This gathering will be a proof to her, as it is also to me, of\r\n    the great devotion and loyalty of the craft to the Throne--a\r\n    devotion and loyalty which have ever animated the Free and\r\n    Accepted Masons of England. We are here, brethren, as you are\r\n    aware, for the purpose of moving an address to the Queen,\r\n    congratulating her upon having attained the fiftieth anniversary\r\n    of her reign. You are well aware that my ancestors--some of them\r\n    former Sovereigns of this nation--did much in support of\r\n    Freemasonry, and, though they well knew it to be a secret\r\n    society, they were well assured that it was in no wise a\r\n    dangerous one. Among our tenets of motives 'loyalty' and\r\n    'philanthropy' stand out prominently, and we are proud of the\r\n    fact. I assure you, brethren, that it is most gratifying to me\r\n    to receive so large, important, and influential a gathering as\r\n    this to-day, and I am rejoiced that in the many events which are\r\n    to be the signs of the people's rejoicing at the Jubilee of the\r\n    Queen, this meeting, at the Royal Albert Hall, of the Free and\r\n    Accepted Masons of England will be first on the list. I will now\r\n    call upon Grand Secretary, Colonel Shadwell E. Clerke, to read\r\n    the proposed address, and then our worshipful brother the Earl\r\n    of Carnarven will move its adoption.\"\r\n\r\nThe Address and the Speech were on the same lines as most of the Jubilee\r\naddresses, but of course with special reference to the loyalty and the\r\ndevotion of Freemasons. The great company having chanted the National\r\nAnthem, the ceremony of giving Jubilee honours was performed, among the\r\nnumerous recipients of which were the Maharajah of Kuch-Behar, the Lord\r\nMayor of London, Sir Francis Knollys, Sir Philip Cunliffe Owen, and Sir\r\nCharles Warren.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master announced that the amount paid by the members that day\r\namounted to upwards of £6000, the whole of which would go to the Masonic\r\ncharities for children and the aged, under the rules of the Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHAFTESBURY HOUSE.\r\n\r\n_June 17th, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales, accompanied by Prince George and\r\nPrincess Louise of Wales, went on the 17th of June, 1887, to lay the\r\nfoundation stone of a central building for the \"National Refuges for\r\nHomeless and Destitute Children.\" There are many institutions in London\r\nfor similar objects, but this charity is one of old standing, and one of\r\nthe most important and best. It was established in 1843 under the\r\npatronage of Lord Shaftesbury, in Great Queen Street. The income of the\r\nSociety was only £180 in the first year, and all that could be attempted\r\nwas to shelter and teach a few poor children in a \"Ragged School,\" open\r\ntwo evenings a week. The efforts of Mr. W. Williams, the Secretary, and\r\nzealous coadjutors, were successful in gradually increasing the\r\noperations of the Society, till, in the year of the Queen's Jubilee, the\r\nCommittee had the satisfaction of managing seven industrial homes, in\r\ntown and country, with more than 1000 children, and two training ships,\r\nthe _Chichester_ and the _Arethusa_, with an annual income of about\r\n£20,000. The good work in its various departments continues to prosper.\r\nAll this and more was stated in an address by the Earl of Jersey,\r\nChairman of the Reception Committee. Among the friends of the Society\r\nwho had witnessed its progress, and helped it from the beginning, was\r\nMr. John MacGregor, the founder of the Shoe-black Brigade, and the chief\r\nhelper of the Secretary in bringing the _Chichester_ to its high\r\nexcellence as a training-ship.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was performed in a tent erected on the site of the new\r\nHome, in Shaftesbury Avenue, close to the once notorious Seven Dials.\r\nThe building is intended to provide shelter for 100 homeless boys, a\r\nhome for 35 working lads, a club for \"old boys\" trained in the\r\ninstitution, and the central offices of the Society. After the address\r\nhad been read, the Prince of Wales thus spoke:--\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Jersey, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--In thanking you for the\r\n    address which you have just read, allow me to express to you,\r\n    and to this great assemblage, the very great gratification it\r\n    gives both the Princess and myself to be here to-day, to take\r\n    part in so interesting and what I may also call a most important\r\n    ceremony. You are well aware of the deep interest and solicitude\r\n    we take with regard to all classes of the community in this\r\n    great Metropolis, but we claim that we take especial interest in\r\n    what concerns the well-being and the welfare of the working\r\n    classes and of the poor of London. It is therefore a great\r\n    gratification to us that I should be afforded the opportunity\r\n    to-day of laying the foundation stone of a home to be called\r\n    'The Jubilee Memorial Home,' in commemoration of the fiftieth\r\n    year of the Queen's reign, and, at the same time, I rejoice to\r\n    think that this building is to be named 'The Shaftesbury House,'\r\n    as a memorial of the great and distinguished philanthropist\r\n    whose loss we must always and shall ever deeply deplore. Most\r\n    sincerely do we hope that this home may be the means of bringing\r\n    many of those waifs and strays always existing in so great a\r\n    metropolis as ours; we trust, too, that they may have such an\r\n    education and training that, as they grow older, they may be\r\n    able to go out into the world honest and respectable citizens,\r\n    and have an opportunity of gaining their livelihood. I thank you\r\n    again, Lord Jersey, for this address, and assure you that it\r\n    gives us the greatest pleasure to be here to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe stone was then well and truly laid, and his Royal Highness was\r\npresented with the trowel. A paper was laid by the Prince upon the\r\nstone, and Lord Jersey announced the gift of £50 from his Royal\r\nHighness, £30 from Sir Robert Carden, and other donations. \"God bless\r\nthe Prince of Wales,\" and the \"National Anthem\" were then chanted. The\r\nRoyal party left amidst enthusiastic cheering. A large number of the\r\nboys from the country homes were present, and from the training-ships in\r\ntheir sailor costumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSECRATION OF TRURO CATHEDRAL.\r\n\r\n_November 3rd, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundation stone of Truro Cathedral was laid in 1879 by the Prince\r\nof Wales, with Masonic ceremony. He was accompanied by the Princess of\r\nWales, Prince Albert Victor, and Prince George. The Prince was again\r\nasked to be present at the Consecration, when the building was\r\ncompleted. The ceremony took place on the 3rd of November, 1887. On\r\narriving at the station, the Mayor of Truro presented an Address, to\r\nwhich the Prince thus replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you for your loyal address and for the kind words with\r\n    which you receive me on this memorable occasion. It affords me\r\n    the most unfeigned satisfaction to be able to attend the great\r\n    religious service which is held here to-day, and to be present\r\n    at the consummation of the important ceremony in which I took a\r\n    leading part more than seven years ago. The interest which the\r\n    Duchess of Cornwall and I have felt in the progress of the work\r\n    has continued unabated since that period, and she commissions me\r\n    to assure you how deep is her regret and disappointment that\r\n    unavoidable causes prevent her from accompanying me to the\r\n    consecration of the first Protestant cathedral erected in\r\n    England since St. Paul's in London. I join most heartily in the\r\n    expression of your hopes that the western part of the building\r\n    may ere long be completed, and I trust that circumstances will\r\n    then allow me once more to visit a town which can boast of\r\n    having been mentioned in Domesday Book 800 years ago. Let me in\r\n    conclusion, gentlemen, express my warm acknowledgments to you\r\n    for the loyal and cordial terms in which you allude to the Queen\r\n    and the Duchess of Cornwall.\"\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, the predecessor of the present Bishop, and\r\na large number of the Episcopal body, with many of the clergy and laity\r\nof the diocese, were present in the Cathedral. The service, including\r\nthe administration of the Holy Communion, occupied nearly four hours.\r\nAfter the service the Prince drove to the Truro Public Rooms, where\r\nabout four hundred of the principal residents of Cornwall assembled for\r\nluncheon, Lord St. Germans, Lord Lieutenant of the County, presiding.\r\n\r\nThe noble Chairman, after proposing the toast of \"The Queen,\" gave that\r\nof \"Their Royal Guest,\" who, he trusted, felt at home in his ancient\r\nDuchy. The Prince, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Mount-Edgcumbe, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--I am deeply\r\n    touched by the very kind manner in which this toast has been\r\n    proposed by our Lord Lieutenant and by the way in which it has\r\n    been received. Although it has not been my good fortune to come\r\n    as often to this ancient Duchy as I could have wished, still\r\n    among the different visits which I have been able to pay you\r\n    none has given me greater pleasure and satisfaction than that\r\n    which I am paying at the present moment. You may rest assured\r\n    that I feel proud of the ancient title that I bear. The interest\r\n    that I take in the welfare of the county will never be\r\n    diminished. Seven years and a half ago I was enabled to lay the\r\n    foundation stone of this cathedral with Masonic honours. To-day\r\n    I have been present at its consecration. The most interesting\r\n    service and religious ceremony at which we have assisted to-day\r\n    are not likely to be forgotten by me, nor by any of you. It is\r\n    the event of a lifetime, and I congratulate you, the Duchy, the\r\n    county, and all connected with it, on the erection of so noble\r\n    an edifice, and I trust that before long we may see the\r\n    completion of the building. It is a real sorrow to me that the\r\n    Princess of Wales and some of my children should not have\r\n    accompanied me on this occasion as they did when the foundation\r\n    stone was laid. Although they are far away, you may feel sure\r\n    that they take a great interest in what is being done here\r\n    to-day. Time is short and we have to leave. If, therefore, the\r\n    words I have uttered to you to-day are few, you must not\r\n    question their sincerity and heartiness. I thank you for the\r\n    kind reception that you always give me when I come among you.\r\n    Before sitting down I wish to give one toast, which I am sure\r\n    you will drink with pleasure. It is 'The Health of our Lord\r\n    Lieutenant.' You know how much is due to him and to your Bishop.\r\n    I am sure that it is a source of great satisfaction to them to\r\n    see so many distinguished prelates around them on this great\r\n    occasion and so large a body of the laity.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was received with enthusiasm, and the company would have\r\nremained standing while the air \"God bless the Prince of Wales\" was\r\nbeing played upon the organ, had not the Prince motioned to them to\r\nresume their seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW COLOURS TO THE OLD 46TH REGIMENT.\r\n\r\n_November 4th, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visit of the Prince of Wales to the West of England closed with the\r\nceremony of presenting new colours to the 2nd Battalion Duke of\r\nCornwall's Light Infantry at Devonport. On his arrival, an address was\r\npresented by the Corporation. The Prince replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have had much satisfaction in receiving your address, and I\r\n    thank you for your kind welcome to a borough in which on more\r\n    than one occasion I have experienced a very cordial reception. I\r\n    have a perfect recollection of the circumstances of my departure\r\n    for Canada to which you allude. It is hardly necessary for me to\r\n    remind you of the many important events which have occurred in\r\n    the history of this kingdom, and in my own life, since the day\r\n    on which I embarked for North America from your port,\r\n    twenty-seven years ago. Let me express to you my warm\r\n    acknowledgments for your gratifying recognition of my earnest\r\n    endeavours to encourage all undertakings tending to promote the\r\n    welfare of this great country. I am well aware that the position\r\n    which I occupy as the eldest son of the Sovereign entails upon\r\n    me the performance of duties which it always has been my most\r\n    earnest desire to fulfil to the utmost of my ability, and I can\r\n    assure my fellow-countrymen that in the future, as in the past,\r\n    they will at all times find me anxious to respond to any call\r\n    which they may make upon me to aid them in the advancement of\r\n    any object either of charity or of public utility.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince then drove to the Raglan Barracks, where the regiment awaited\r\nhis arrival.\r\n\r\nThe usual ceremonies on such occasions were proceeded with, and the old\r\ncolours, which had been borne by the 46th, or South Devon Regiment, as\r\nit was formerly called, through the Crimean War and in Egypt, were taken\r\nto the rear to the music of \"Auld Lang Syne.\" The new colours, after the\r\nprayer of consecration by the chaplain of the garrison, were presented\r\nto the lieutenants. The Prince then addressed the troops:--\r\n\r\n    \"Colonel Grieve, Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Men of\r\n    the 2nd Battalion Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry,--You have\r\n    conferred a great pleasure and satisfaction upon me in having\r\n    asked me to give your efficient regiment new colours. I do so\r\n    with the greatest pleasure, because I know that, in giving these\r\n    new colours, I intrust them to the care of a regiment which has\r\n    distinguished itself for many years in every part of the globe,\r\n    and that they are certain to be in safe hands, and will continue\r\n    to do honour to their Sovereign and country as heretofore. I am\r\n    proud to be associated with your regiment as Honorary Colonel of\r\n    the 3rd Battalion. I am aware that, perhaps, the old name of the\r\n    46th is more dear to you; but I feel sure that, whether under\r\n    that name or under the present one, you will continue to bear\r\n    the high state of efficiency which has always existed ever since\r\n    the regiment was raised.\r\n\r\n    \"Your regiment was raised, as I am aware, in 1741, and you\r\n    distinguished yourselves in the War of Independence. In\r\n    consequence, in 1777, of your Light Company at Dominica having\r\n    gallantly defended General Wayns, you were awarded the privilege\r\n    of wearing red feathers, a distinction which you still bear in\r\n    the shape of red cloth on your helmets, and of which you feel\r\n    very proud. I am also aware that your regiment served with\r\n    distinction in the Crimea, and these old colours, which are to\r\n    be carried by the old regiment no more, were given to you on\r\n    board ship, prior to landing in the Crimea, and have been used\r\n    for many years. You have since served in different parts of the\r\n    Empire, and especially in the recent campaign in Egypt and in\r\n    the Nile Expedition, under the command of the late gallant and\r\n    lamented General Earle. There is much more that I could say in\r\n    connection with your distinguished services, but, owing to the\r\n    want of time and the unfortunate inclemency of the weather, I do\r\n    not wish to detain the regiment longer than is necessary on\r\n    parade. Let me congratulate you, Colonel Grieve, on the smart\r\n    appearance of your regiment and the admirable way in which they\r\n    look. I sincerely hope the regiment, as opportunities offer,\r\n    though I hope they may not, whether in the defensive or\r\n    offensive, will continue as it always has to distinguish itself.\r\n    I can congratulate you, Colonel Grieve, upon the honour of\r\n    commanding so fine and efficient a regiment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLASGOW EXHIBITION OF 1888.\r\n\r\n_May 8th, 1888._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May, 1888, the Exhibition at Glasgow was opened by the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales. There have been many Exhibitions,\r\ninternational and national, since the famous \"World's Fair\" of 1851, but\r\nfew of them have surpassed, in variety of interest, that which the\r\nGlasgow people have successfully carried out, in the spacious and\r\npicturesque building in Kelvin Grove Park. Certainly, not one of the\r\nnational Exhibitions has offered so wonderful a display of the wealth,\r\nenterprise, and versatility in productive industry, of the subjects of\r\nthe British Crown. There was at Manchester an unrivalled collection of\r\nart-treasures, and at other places there have been special features of\r\ndistinction. But, on the whole, the Exhibition at Glasgow has been one\r\nof most varied excellence, worthy of the Queen's Jubilee year, when the\r\npreparations were made for it, and worthy of the silver-wedding year of\r\nthe Prince and Princess, whose presence was welcomed on the opening\r\nday. The experience of other Exhibitions has not been lost, and one of\r\nthe most interesting portions of the show has been the antiquarian and\r\nhistorical collection displayed in the Old \"Bishop's Palace,\" after the\r\nmanner of the artificial constructions first made familiar in the\r\nstreets of \"Old London\" at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nBefore opening the Exhibition, the Prince and Princess were received in\r\nthe Corporation Chambers by the Lord Provost, magistrates, and a\r\ndistinguished assembly. An address of welcome was read by Dr. Marwick,\r\nthe Town Clerk, some of the points of which may be gathered from the\r\nreply of the Prince, which was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord Provost and Gentlemen,--I have received your address\r\n    with feelings of sincere satisfaction, and I thank you on behalf\r\n    of the Princess of Wales and myself for your cordial words of\r\n    welcome and your kind reference to our Silver Wedding. We have\r\n    come here to-day to celebrate, in one of the most prosperous\r\n    cities of the United Kingdom, the inauguration of a great\r\n    national work of the highest and most varied interest, and one\r\n    altogether worthy of your important city. I can assure you I\r\n    thoroughly understand and appreciate the anxious desire which\r\n    has prevailed among you that an Industrial Exhibition should be\r\n    held this year in Glasgow, and I consider that with the\r\n    commercial, manufacturing, and mercantile eminence which she\r\n    enjoys, such a desire is not only right and proper in the\r\n    highest degree, but natural and commendable. We warmly\r\n    sympathise with you in this feeling, and I would that my\r\n    lamented father were alive now to witness the development of the\r\n    general idea of which he was the originator. The relations of\r\n    this city with all the markets of the civilised world have long\r\n    been well known, but they have been immensely extended during\r\n    the present century by the energy and enterprise of those\r\n    merchants and citizens, who, by deepening the Clyde and\r\n    providing the extensive harbour and dock accommodation which now\r\n    exists, have overcome the natural disadvantages of its position,\r\n    and given it a permanent place among the shipping ports and\r\n    commercial centres of the Kingdom. Let me, my Lord Provost and\r\n    Gentlemen, sincerely thank you for the loyal terms in which you\r\n    alluded to the Queen. I shall have much pleasure in\r\n    communicating to Her Majesty the hope that you have expressed\r\n    that she will visit your magnificent Exhibition, and I will not\r\n    fail to acquaint her likewise with your words of devotion to her\r\n    throne and person.\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal party left the Council Chamber for the Lord Provost's\r\nresidence, where they partook of luncheon. After the luncheon the Royal\r\nparty passed under a triumphal arch at the West-end Park main entrance,\r\nand over the Prince of Wales Bridge, opposite the Exhibition gate. Sir\r\nArchibald Campbell, President of the Executive Committee, here met the\r\nPrince, and a number of gentlemen who have been instrumental in\r\npromoting the Exhibition were introduced to his Royal Highness. Sir A.\r\nCampbell handed to the Prince a gold key, and his Royal Highness, amidst\r\ncheers, opened the east door of the vestibule, and entered the\r\nExhibition. The Prince and Princess walked to the front of the platform\r\nof the Grand Hall, the Glasgow Choral Union meanwhile singing the\r\nNational Anthem, and the Artillery on the neighbouring heights firing a\r\nsalute of twenty-one guns. After their Royal Highnesses were seated and\r\nprayers had been read by the Rev. Dr. D. M'Leod, Sir A. Campbell\r\npresented an address.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, accepting the address, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Archibald Campbell, my Lords and Gentlemen,--I thank you\r\n    for your address, and I can assure you that it affords the\r\n    Princess of Wales and myself very sincere pleasure to be present\r\n    on this important occasion. That gratification is increased by\r\n    the sense of the connection which you have recognised as\r\n    existing between this International Exhibition and that in which\r\n    my revered father took so deep an interest and so active a part.\r\n    The various Exhibitions which have been held since 1851 have\r\n    undoubtedly done much, not only to enlist the sympathy of the\r\n    nations of the world and to engage them in friendly rivalries of\r\n    industrial competition, but largely to extend our knowledge of\r\n    every branch of manufacture, and to afford pleasure to all ranks\r\n    and classes of society in every country in which these\r\n    Exhibitions have been held. Recognising the benefits which they\r\n    have thus conferred, such Exhibitions can never fail to enlist\r\n    the sympathy of the Queen and command the support of the\r\n    Princess and myself. We are here to-day to give personal\r\n    testimony to that feeling, and to express our satisfaction not\r\n    only with the public spirit with which the undertaking has been\r\n    supported financially, but with the enthusiasm with which\r\n    exhibitors from all parts of the world have enriched the\r\n    collections of science, art, and industry gathered within these\r\n    buildings.\r\n\r\n    \"Nor is it possible to overlook the special appropriateness of\r\n    such an Exhibition in this city, in which the researches and\r\n    discoveries of Black, of Watt, and, in our own day, of Thomson,\r\n    have been productive of world-wide benefits to mankind. In the\r\n    application of science also, Glasgow can point with just pride\r\n    to Bell, whose 'Comet' is still preserved as a memorial of the\r\n    first attempt to apply the forces of steam to the propulsion of\r\n    ships, and to the multifarious industries which have here found\r\n    a home. To the widely different character of these industries,\r\n    which secure to the population of this district immunity from\r\n    many of the risks which necessarily attend devotion to one\r\n    special department of labour, it is only possible to allude in\r\n    general terms. Here there exist and flourish side by side great\r\n    establishments for shipbuilding, the production of marine\r\n    machinery, locomotives, mill machinery, and mechanical\r\n    appliances for the working of iron and coal for the production\r\n    of mineral oil, the manufacture of thread, glass, and pottery,\r\n    carpet-weaving, dyeing and printing. It must not likewise be\r\n    over-looked that Glasgow was the cradle of the steam-carrying\r\n    trade with America and the great mercantile centres of the\r\n    world. It is gratifying to me to learn that, in the\r\n    comprehensive collection to be found here, due regard has been\r\n    paid to the exhibition of works of art, and that the walls of\r\n    your galleries are enriched by many and valuable paintings and\r\n    works of sculpture. Here, as in the Exhibition at Manchester,\r\n    are to be found evidences of the fact that the successful\r\n    prosecution of trade, manufacture, and commerce afford not only\r\n    the means of gratifying, but of developing the taste for art.\r\n\r\n    \"Not the least interesting of all is the section in which an\r\n    honourable place has been given to the works of artisan\r\n    exhibitors. In every industrial community, and nowhere more so\r\n    than in Glasgow, the development of the taste, skill, and\r\n    handicraft of its operatives must always command a respectful\r\n    consideration and interest. To the Women's Industry Section we\r\n    shall also look with special sympathy, recognising the\r\n    importance of encouraging every means by which women's work may\r\n    be made productive.\r\n\r\n    \"It is also a gratification to us to observe that the artistic\r\n    building in which the Exhibition is contained occupies an\r\n    appropriate position within, I may almost say, the shadow of the\r\n    University of Glasgow, the second in antiquity of the old\r\n    Universities of Scotland. The site of the University is no doubt\r\n    modern; but it is satisfactory to see the Institution which was\r\n    founded through the influence of King James II. in 1450 in a\r\n    more flourishing state at present than at any previous period of\r\n    its history. It only remains now for the Princess and myself to\r\n    express our earnest hope that this great Exhibition may prove an\r\n    immense success, and that the thousands who, we trust, will\r\n    visit it may derive such instruction from an examination of its\r\n    various sections as will prove of material advantage to them for\r\n    years to come.\"\r\n\r\nAfter an Inauguration Ode had been sung, the Prince declared the\r\nExhibition open, amid much enthusiasm. The Hallelujah Chorus was then\r\ngiven by the choir. The Royal party spent considerable time in\r\ninspecting various parts of the Exhibition, the Princess being specially\r\ninterested in the \"Women's Industries\" Section; after which they\r\nreturned to the Central Railway Station, _en route_ to Hamilton Palace.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, May 8, the Queen, accompanied by the Princess\r\nChristian, and other members of the Royal family, honoured by her\r\npresence the performance of Sir Arthur Sullivan's _Golden Legend_, given\r\nby command at the Royal Albert Hall. Later in the year, on the 22nd\r\nAugust, she gratified the citizens of Glasgow by visiting the\r\nExhibition, in response to the loyal invitation from the Corporation and\r\nthe Committee given to the Prince on the opening day. The Queen honoured\r\nSir Archibald Campbell, of Blythswood, Chairman of the Committee, by\r\nbeing his guest on that occasion. The opportunity of this Royal visit\r\nwas taken for opening the new municipal buildings in George Square. It\r\nwas nearly forty years since Her Majesty, along with the lamented Prince\r\nConsort, had visited the western capital of Scotland. No city in her\r\nMajesty's dominions has made more wonderful progress than Glasgow, or\r\nmade more eager use of its natural advantages. The visit of the Prince\r\nof Wales at the opening of the Exhibition, and the subsequent visit of\r\nthe Queen will make the year 1888 ever memorable in the annals of\r\nGlasgow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR BARTLE FRERE'S STATUE.\r\n\r\n_June 5th, 1888._\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the memorials of illustrious men in the gardens of the Thames\r\nEmbankment, no one will be honoured more than the statue to Sir Bartle\r\nFrere. It was erected by public subscription, in memory of his private\r\nvirtues and of his public services. The grand bronze figure of the\r\npatriotic Englishman is much admired. The likeness is good, and the\r\nwhole monument, with its pedestal of Cornish granite, imposing. Many\r\ndistinguished men were present to witness the unveiling of the statue by\r\nthe Prince of Wales on the 5th of June, 1888. He was accompanied by the\r\nPrincess, and their two daughters, the Princesses Maud and Victoria.\r\nAmong the company were the Duke of Cambridge, the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, Lord Napier of Magdala, and Sir Richard Temple, M.P., who\r\nasked the Prince of Wales to perform the ceremony. The Prince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Richard Temple, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--It gave me great\r\n    pleasure, after the lamented death of Sir Bartle Frere, to\r\n    accept the post of President of the Committee, especially when\r\n    we found that a Memorial like this statue was to be erected to\r\n    the memory of a great and valued public servant of the Crown,\r\n    and at the same time to a highly esteemed and dear friend of\r\n    myself.\" His Royal Highness then briefly recounted the chief\r\n    points in Sir Bartle Frere's long and distinguished career in\r\n    India and Africa, a career with which all present were doubtless\r\n    acquainted. Continuing, His Royal Highness remarked:--\"For his\r\n    services in India, whither he first went in the year 1834, in\r\n    the service of the East India Company, Sir Bartle Frere twice\r\n    received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament. On his return\r\n    home he successfully conducted negotiations with the Sultan of\r\n    Zanzibar for the suppression of the slave trade, and, later, I\r\n    had the good fortune to have his services during my journey to\r\n    India in 1876. The last, but no means the least, important of\r\n    Sir Bartle Frere's duties was as Governor-General of the Cape of\r\n    Good Hope and Lord High Commissioner to South Africa. There is\r\n    much more that I might say, but the facts are known to history,\r\n    and I will, therefore, in conclusion, merely express my thanks\r\n    for having been asked to perform this ceremony, and remind\r\n    those present that, on this very day four years ago, when the\r\n    late Sir Bartle Frere was laid to his rest, the procession\r\n    passed by the spot where the statue now stands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW GYMNASIUM IN LONG ACRE.\r\n\r\n_July 6th, 1888._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, accompanied by Prince Albert Victor, opened the new\r\ngymnasium connected with the Central Young Men's Christian Association,\r\non the 6th of July, 1888. The gymnasium is in Long Acre, in what was\r\nformerly the Queen's Theatre. The King of Sweden and Norway, Lord\r\nAberdeen, President of the Gymnastic Club, Mr. J. Herbert Tritton,\r\nPresident of the Young Men's Christian Association, Lord Charles\r\nBeresford, Lord Kinnaird, the Earl of Meath, the Bishop of London, Lord\r\nBrassey, Lord Harris, and other distinguished persons were present. The\r\nBishop of London offered a dedicatory prayer. The Earl of Aberdeen read\r\nan address, in which it was stated that the Young Men's Christian\r\nAssociation, which had its head-quarters at Exeter Hall, was founded\r\nforty-four years ago, and had at the present time nearly 4000 affiliated\r\nbranches scattered throughout the Colonies and the civilised world\r\n(seventy-seven of which are in London), with an aggregate membership of\r\n250,000. It formed a rendezvous for young men, and a centre for the\r\ndevelopment of a strong, healthy, religious life among them. In recent\r\nyears the value of athletics had been more fully recognised, and the\r\nCommittee of the Central Association had availed themselves of that\r\nvaluable adjunct in the work. The Exeter Hall Gymnasium Team having won\r\n(in open competition) the 200-guinea Challenge Shield and Gold Medals\r\noffered by the National Physical Recreation Society, it would be deemed\r\na circumstance of the utmost honour by the recipients to have received\r\ntheir medals at the hands of the Prince of Wales. Moreover, the\r\nGymnasium was able to supply voluntary teachers who instructed children\r\nand others of the poorer classes in the exercises which they had\r\nacquired in that place.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Majesty, Lord Aberdeen, my Lords, Ladies, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--I am most grateful to you, indeed, Lord Aberdeen,\r\n    for the address which you have just read to me. I can assure you\r\n    all that by coming here I receive very great satisfaction, and I\r\n    am glad to take part in a work in which so many of you are\r\n    interested. From the account you, Lord Aberdeen, have given us\r\n    of the Young Men's Christian Association, I have little doubt\r\n    but that it is an association founded upon excellent and\r\n    practical principles, and that it is an association likely not\r\n    only long to continue in existence, but likely to be greatly\r\n    augmented in its usefulness, as well as in the numbers benefited\r\n    by it. I am glad that you combine with Christian education\r\n    healthy recreation, which must, no doubt, tend to be of the\r\n    greatest benefit to the community at large, and especially to\r\n    young men who are exposed to so many temptations in a great city\r\n    like this. It is a great advantage to all young men to have the\r\n    opportunity of enjoying healthy and useful recreation. Thank you\r\n    for asking me to take part in the proceedings of the day. And we\r\n    must all tender our thanks to the King of Sweden and Norway for\r\n    coming here to-day, knowing, as we all do, how deeply interested\r\n    his Majesty must be in work of this kind, and of the important\r\n    part drill has played amongst his people. I have now great\r\n    pleasure in declaring this gymnasium open.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Gladstone, M.P., President of the National Physical\r\nRecreation Society, informed the King and Prince that the 200-guinea\r\nchallenge shield offered by that Society had this year been won by the\r\nteam of eight sent from Exeter Hall Club to the contest in Dundee, and\r\nhe asked the Prince of Wales to do them the honour of presenting the\r\nshield and gold medals to the winners. Thereupon Mr. E. Sully, the\r\ninstructor, at the head of the victorious team, advanced up the room,\r\nand, after receiving a gold medal each from the Prince, they shouldered\r\nthe handsome and massive shield, and, at a run, raced away with the\r\ntrophy.\r\n\r\nThen followed an exhibition of drill by thirty members chosen out of 400\r\nmembers of the Club. These were clad in flannels, and wore red or black\r\nstockings. They went through an exposition of musical drill, accompanied\r\nby the piano, the exercises consisting of those with dumb-bells, clubs,\r\nand bars, Mr. Sully giving the word of command. Occasionally the\r\nathletes sang as they drilled, at other moments they whistled as they\r\nswung their clubs or poles about.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the exercises the King rose and said:--\"Your Royal\r\nHighnesses, I cannot leave this hall without expressing the satisfaction\r\nI have had in witnessing the exercises here. I wish also to add my good\r\nwishes for the progress and prosperity of this Association. I feel great\r\nsatisfaction in witnessing the execution of the gymnastic exercises this\r\nmorning--exercises which are very highly appreciated in my country.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales summoned Mr. Sully, shook hands with him, and\r\ncongratulated him upon the admirable display made by his pupils. The\r\nKing of Sweden did the same, very highly praising the manner in which\r\nthe drill had been executed.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, Prince Albert Victor, and the King of Sweden then\r\nleft the hall amid the cheers of those assembled. The heartiness with\r\nwhich the Prince spoke, and the interest which he showed in the whole\r\nproceedings, greatly delighted all who were present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL MASONIC INSTITUTE FOR GIRLS.\r\n\r\n_July 6th, 1888._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe centenary festival of the Royal Masonic Institute for Girls was held\r\non the 6th of July, 1888, in the Royal Albert Hall, the Prince of Wales,\r\nGrand Master, presiding. Between two and three thousand members of the\r\nCraft were present, amongst them being the King of Sweden and Norway,\r\nPrince Albert Victor, the Earl of Carnarvon, the Earl of Lathom, the\r\nEarl of Zetland, Lord Egerton of Tatton, Lord Leigh, and many other\r\neminent Masons. The galleries were filled by a large number of ladies.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the Prince of Wales gave the first toast, which was that\r\nof \"The Queen and the Craft,\" and was received with the greatest\r\nenthusiasm, the whole of the vast audience rising and joining in singing\r\nthe National Anthem.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales then said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Majesty and Brethren,--A very high honour and a very high\r\n    compliment has been conferred upon us this night. At this great\r\n    and important gathering, probably the largest meeting for a\r\n    charitable object that has ever taken place anywhere, we have as\r\n    our guest his Majesty the King of Sweden. I little doubted the\r\n    manner in which you would receive this toast, because not only\r\n    are we honouring a distinguished guest, but also a brave ally of\r\n    ours, and we are further honouring the Grand Master of the\r\n    Freemasons of Sweden. We all know the deep interest which his\r\n    Majesty takes in our Craft, and what excellent Masons the Swedes\r\n    are. In proposing this toast it is specially gratifying to me,\r\n    for I have looked forward to this occasion for many years,\r\n    because it was through the King and his late brother that,\r\n    twenty years ago, I was initiated into the mysteries of the\r\n    Craft, and I am proud to be one of you, and, still more, to be\r\n    at your head. I am grateful to the King for having made me one\r\n    of us. Brethren, I know you will drink this toast with\r\n    cordiality, and at the same time I feel that it will be right to\r\n    give this toast Masonically, for in doing so we do honour to our\r\n    guest and to ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with Masonic honours.\r\n\r\nThe King of Sweden, who was loudly cheered on rising, said:--\"Most\r\nWorshipful Grand Master and Brethren,--The toast I have the honour of\r\nreplying to I acknowledge, not only on my own behalf, but on behalf of\r\nall the foreign Lodges and Masonic congregations whose principles and\r\nconstitution are in conformity with yours. On their behalf I would also\r\nexpress the great satisfaction I feel at the honour and distinction\r\nto-day conferred upon me by your Grand Master and by you in constituting\r\nme a member of your honoured body. I feel much satisfaction in being\r\npresent at such an enormous gathering as this, and one assembled for\r\npurposes of so noble a kind. Patriotic feelings are always noble and\r\nhonourable, and nowhere have they taken deeper root than in this\r\ncountry, for whose people, ever since my young days, I have felt the\r\nmost profound esteem. But there is one feeling still more noble than\r\npatriotism, and that is the feeling which has its foundation in the Word\r\nof God, and unites us in love and charity to mankind. As we sing at\r\nMasonic gatherings in my own country, 'There is one God, our Father, so\r\nbe His sons then, brethren.' This is the bond which exists between us,\r\nthe rallying cry which unites us, and the lasting tie which binds us. I\r\nhave the greatest pleasure in giving you 'The Health of our Grand\r\nMaster, the Prince of Wales.'\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with full Masonic honours. The Prince of Wales, in\r\nreply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Majesty and Brethren,--You are well aware that during the\r\n    fourteen years I have held the high office of Grand Master I\r\n    have striven not to be unmindful of your interests and of those\r\n    of the Craft, and, though I am prevented by my many duties from\r\n    meeting you as often as I should like, still I hope that you are\r\n    convinced that your interests are none the less dear to me. We\r\n    have heard an address from the King of Sweden this evening which\r\n    none of us are likely to forget, and I think, if he will allow\r\n    me to say so, that we Englishmen have reason to envy his\r\n    facility in speaking our language. It is, I believe, the first\r\n    time that a foreign Sovereign has honoured a gathering of this\r\n    kind. I think that we may look upon this as a red-letter day,\r\n    and we are not likely to forget the King's presence, or the\r\n    kind and useful words which he has spoken. Our watchword,\r\n    'Religion and Charity,' is one which has been inculcated in us\r\n    ever since we belonged to the Craft, and it is one which we\r\n    shall do well to remember. If we uphold those principles, and,\r\n    above all, that idea of patriotism of which the King has spoken,\r\n    there is little doubt that the Craft will remain as prosperous\r\n    as it is now, and that our lodges and members will increase. I\r\n    do not wish to allude to foreign lodges with whom we are not in\r\n    accord; but I would ask that at any rate we should strive to\r\n    pick out what is good in them, and remember that we are not only\r\n    English Freemasons, but Freemasons of the entire universe. I\r\n    trust that as long as I live, or as long as I may be permitted\r\n    to hold the high office of your Grand Master, I may continue to\r\n    do my duty to the Craft and to my country. I wish now to ask his\r\n    Majesty the King of Sweden to accept the Steward's badge of this\r\n    festival.\"\r\n\r\nHis Majesty was then invested with the badge, amidst loud cheers. The\r\nGrand Master then said he had much pleasure in reading a telegram from\r\nNew York to the following effect:--\"Grand Lodge in annual communication\r\ncongratulates the fraternity in England on the one-hundredth anniversary\r\nof the foundation of the Royal Masonic Institute for Girls.\"\r\n\r\nAgain rising, the Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Majesty and Brethren,--I have now the honour to give you\r\n    the last toast, though it may be safely called the most\r\n    important, as the object with which we have met at this enormous\r\n    and unprecedented gathering is to celebrate the centenary of the\r\n    Royal Masonic Institute for Girls. That an institution should\r\n    have existed a hundred years is one proof that it is a good one,\r\n    and we have every reason to be grateful to those who, from the\r\n    commencement up to the present time, have given their energy and\r\n    their labours to keep going so thoroughly Masonic an\r\n    Institution.\r\n\r\n    \"As you are aware, the Institution was founded by the Chevalier\r\n    Ruspini. King George IV. and King William IV. were patrons,\r\n    besides many members of the Royal Family, and Her Majesty the\r\n    Queen is patroness now. The school at first contained only\r\n    fifteen children; it now contains 243, and they are educated up\r\n    to a high religious standard, combined with education of a\r\n    general character, including music. Particular attention is\r\n    paid to needlework and cooking and domestic duties. Only a few\r\n    days ago I was present here and saw the girls go through their\r\n    marching exercise, and I never saw anything more satisfactory.\r\n    There are many commanding officers who would be proud to see\r\n    their men march and go through their exercise as we saw them\r\n    performed. I may state the system was established by Miss Davis,\r\n    who was appointed head governess in 1861, and I am glad to think\r\n    that at this moment she retains her post. She has been eminently\r\n    successful, as is manifest by the Cambridge Local, College of\r\n    Preceptors, and the Science and Art Examinations. It is also\r\n    satisfactory to notice that, with the exception of Miss Davis,\r\n    every member of the staff has been educated at the Institution.\r\n    The Head Governess of the Female Masonic School at Dublin and\r\n    the Head Governess of the British Orphan Asylum were educated at\r\n    our school, and during a period of eighty-four years there have\r\n    been but two matrons, one of whom held the appointment over\r\n    fifty-two years.\r\n\r\n    \"As you are aware, the object we have in view in meeting here\r\n    to-night is to make important additions to the present\r\n    buildings, and provide accommodation for an increased number of\r\n    children. These additions will cost at least £20,000. In 1838,\r\n    on the occasion of the jubilee of the Institution, £1000 was\r\n    subscribed at the annual festival, and in 1871, when I had the\r\n    honour of presiding, as much as £5200 was collected. But I have\r\n    now an announcement to make which I think will interest you\r\n    beyond measure, and that is that I have received the assurance\r\n    of the Secretary that we have obtained at this centenary\r\n    festival over £50,000. I may safely challenge anybody to dispute\r\n    the statement that so large a sum has never been subscribed at a\r\n    charity dinner. It now affords me great pleasure to propose\r\n    'Success to the Institution,' coupled with the name of the\r\n    Deputy Grand Master, the Earl of Lathom, Chairman of the\r\n    Executive Committee, and an old and personal friend of my own.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Lathom replied, and the proceedings terminated. The grand\r\ntotal of the subscription was £50,472, of which London contributed\r\n£22,454, and the Provinces, India, and the Colonies £28,018.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST NORFOLK HUNT.\r\n\r\n_April 9th, 1888._\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many memorial gifts of the Silver Wedding of the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales was one which would have delighted Sir Roger de\r\nCoverley or the Squire of Bracebridge Hall. The members of the West\r\nNorfolk Fox Hunt presented a handsome silver figure of Reynard in full\r\ngallop, mounted on a dark mahogany stand. A beautifully bound morocco\r\nalbum contained the names of the subscribers. The presentation was made\r\non the 8th of April, the day of the Annual Steeplechase at East Winch,\r\nnear Lynn. A marquee had been erected, and a large company assembled.\r\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales and all the family were present.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamond, for many years Master of the Hunt, made the presentation, he\r\nhaving been the Chairman of the Committee who had carried on the Hunt\r\nduring the past two years, in the temporary absence of the Master, Mr.\r\nA. C. Fountaine. He believed that the West Norfolk were the first pack\r\nof hounds that the Princess hunted with when she came to England. The\r\nPrince and Princess had entered into the sports and recreations of all\r\nclasses of Her Majesty's subjects, and the sport which the members of\r\nthe Hunt had enjoyed with their Royal Highnesses and their sons and\r\ndaughters would long be remembered. He asked the acceptance of their\r\ngift by the Prince and Princess.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Hamond, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--I can assure you that no\r\n    present which has been offered for our acceptance has been\r\n    received by us with more pleasure than the one which you have\r\n    given us to-day--- a model of the wily animal that we are all to\r\n    fond of following. Norfolk has always been considered to be a\r\n    shooting county; that may be so to a great extent, but I feel\r\n    convinced that the hunting is quite as popular, and I sincerely\r\n    hope that it will long remain so. There may be difficulties in\r\n    preserving foxes, but I feel sure that where there's a will\r\n    there's a way. For twenty-five years we have enjoyed hunting\r\n    with the West Norfolk Hunt--both the Princess and myself; and\r\n    our children have been brought up to follow that Hunt. I\r\n    sincerely hope that for many long years we may be able to\r\n    continue to do so. We have grateful memories of the mastership\r\n    of one whose loss we all regretted, the late Mr. Villebois, and\r\n    also of Mr. Hamond, then Mr. Fountaine, and next of the\r\n    gentlemen of the Committee who have of late ably carried on the\r\n    Hunt, whilst Mr. Fountaine was unfortunately away. Most\r\n    sincerely do I thank you again, in the name of the Princess and\r\n    myself, for the kind terms in which you have presented us with\r\n    this handsome and appropriate gift, and most sincerely do I wish\r\n    prosperity to the West Norfolk Foxhounds, which, I trust, may\r\n    long continue to exist in this county.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT BLACKBURN.\r\n\r\n_May 9th, 1888._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the return from opening the Exhibition at Glasgow, it was arranged\r\nthat the Prince and Princess of Wales should visit Blackburn, for laying\r\nthe foundation-stone of the new Technical and Trades School in that\r\nflourishing Lancashire town. The borough was in high festival, the more\r\nso as it was the first time on record that it had been honoured with the\r\npresence of royalty. At the entrance of the town, the Mayor and\r\nCorporation met the Royal party, and conducted them to the marquee which\r\nwas to be the scene of the ceremony. Here the Prince was presented with\r\nthe freedom of the borough--being the first honorary freeman--and with\r\nan address, to which he replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--I can assure you that the Princess of\r\n    Wales and myself feel very great pleasure in accepting your\r\n    address, and we thank you warmly for the kind and cordial words\r\n    of welcome with which you have received us on the occasion of\r\n    our first visit to the important borough of Blackburn. We thank\r\n    you most sincerely for your congratulations on our Silver\r\n    Wedding, and we desire to take this opportunity of publicly\r\n    stating how infinitely we have been touched by the affectionate\r\n    tokens of attachment and regard which have universally been\r\n    shown towards us throughout the whole country on the occasion of\r\n    that event. We appreciate very highly your allusions to the\r\n    interest which we take in all things related to the progress and\r\n    welfare of the kingdom, and more especially to the interest we\r\n    have taken in the subject of technical education; and I rejoice,\r\n    therefore, to find that I am able to come here to-day to lay the\r\n    foundation-stone of an institution which I trust will afford\r\n    material assistance in maintaining and advancing the industries\r\n    and commercial enterprise of your town. I have very much\r\n    gratification in complying with your request that I would accept\r\n    the honorary freedom of your borough, and I shall experience a\r\n    feeling of pride in signing my name as the first honorary\r\n    freeman of a town so loyal and prosperous, and that, I am\r\n    persuaded, has so great a future before it as Blackburn.\"\r\n\r\nTo another address by the Freemasons of Blackburn the Grand Master\r\nexpressed his sense of the compliment paid him by their words of\r\nfraternal friendship, and gladly acceded to the wish that the first\r\nstone of so important and useful an institution should be laid with\r\nMasonic honours,--which was done accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe Mayoress of Blackburn then, on behalf of the ladies of Blackburn,\r\npresented the Princess of Wales with a magnificent diamond brooch\r\nrepresenting Industry. Her Royal Highness said a few happy words in\r\nacknowledgment. The Prince, it should have been mentioned, received the\r\nroll of freedom enclosed in a very handsome gold casket. The Royal\r\nvisitors wore afterwards entertained at luncheon in the Town Hall, where\r\nnumerous guests were present. In responding to the loyal toasts the\r\nPrince said:--\r\n\r\n    \"You may be assured that we are not likely to forget our visit\r\n    to Blackburn. The cordial and enthusiastic manner in which you\r\n    have received us, the beautiful way in which your streets and\r\n    houses have been decorated, and the wonderful order that was\r\n    kept throughout will not be forgotten by us. It will afford me,\r\n    also, great gratification and pleasure to acquaint the Queen\r\n    with the loyalty which has been shown to the Princess and\r\n    myself, who are the first members of the Royal families of\r\n    England who have visited your borough. The objects we have had\r\n    in view in coming here are, we are sure, excellent ones; and we\r\n    rejoice that there has been afforded to us the opportunity of\r\n    laying the foundation-stone of an institution which is likely to\r\n    do so much good. As the Mayor has said, I do take a sincere\r\n    interest in all that concerns technical instruction, because I\r\n    feel convinced that, in a vast country like ours, where so many\r\n    trades and different manufactures exist, nothing is of such\r\n    great importance to the well-being of its manufactures and\r\n    trades as a good sound technical education. We cannot erect too\r\n    many schools or institutions of the kind in the various parts of\r\n    the country. The school the foundation-stone of which we have\r\n    laid to-day has been properly started as a remembrance of the\r\n    Queen's Jubilee, and, as the special object of it is for the\r\n    technical education of the operative classes, I sincerely hope\r\n    that they also will show that they take a great interest in it,\r\n    and will thoroughly support it. I am glad to hear that there is\r\n    already existing in this borough a Technical and Art School,\r\n    which for two years has been in existence. I am told that there\r\n    are as many as 300 students, and those students who have gone up\r\n    to London to be examined by the Technical Institute have, I\r\n    understand, passed the very highest and best examinations. The\r\n    interest which this town takes in the subject of technical\r\n    education is a very gratifying one. You must remember that\r\n    improved talent for the production of more varied and artistic\r\n    designs in the staple manufacture is essential for the continued\r\n    prosperity of the town, and the more artisans learn what is\r\n    necessary to beautify the trade to which they belong, and vary\r\n    the different specimens which they bring forward, the more\r\n    likely the town is to flourish. Before sitting down I have a\r\n    toast to propose to you, 'The Mayor and Corporation of\r\n    Blackburn, and success to the Blackburn Technical School.' In\r\n    proposing this toast I am glad to have this opportunity of\r\n    thanking the Mayor for his kind hospitality and the cordial\r\n    welcome he has afforded us. He may be assured we shall never\r\n    forget the kind reception we have received at Blackburn.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mayor briefly responded to the toast. The Royal party afterwards\r\nproceeded to the Blackburn Railway Station, and left for London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANGLO-DANISH EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n_May 14th, 1888._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Danish Exhibition at South Kensington had not the official\r\norigin of some other similar displays, but the nationality of the\r\nscheme, and the promise of its proceeds being applied to a charitable\r\nobject, secured the patronage of the Prince and Princess of Wales at its\r\nopening. This ceremony took place in the Albert Hall, on the 14th of\r\nMay, 1888.\r\n\r\nTheir Royal Highnesses were accompanied by the Princesses Louise, Maud,\r\nand Victoria of Wales, the Princess Mary of Cambridge and her daughter\r\nthe Princess Victoria, Prince Karl of Denmark, Prince George of Greece,\r\nthe Danish Minister, and many distinguished persons. They were received\r\nby Lord Amherst, Chairman of the Committee, who presented an address, to\r\nwhich--after the musical and other ceremonies, and the formal opening of\r\nthe Exhibition by the Princess of Wales--the Prince replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Amherst, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--In your address you have\r\n    expressed the hope that the Exhibition will be a success. We\r\n    most sincerely hope it will be a success in every sense of the\r\n    word. The objects, as you are well aware, are, first, to pay a\r\n    compliment to us in respect of the twenty-fifth anniversary of\r\n    our wedding-day; and, secondly, to aid an institution which is\r\n    much in need of funds, and one which is most meritorious and\r\n    useful. You are anxious that money should be obtained in order\r\n    to build a new Home for Incurables. Very appropriately this\r\n    Exhibition has been connected with the institution which was the\r\n    first with which the Princess became connected when she came to\r\n    this country. I sincerely hope that the endeavours you have made\r\n    will be successful, and that the Exhibition will be instructive,\r\n    agreeable, and useful. It must be gratifying to you to see that\r\n    the King of Denmark has sent over one of his war ships, manned\r\n    by all those fine young men who are around us, and it is\r\n    gratifying to all of us, I am sure, to welcome these ladies\r\n    whose costumes lend such picturesqueness to the scene. We thank\r\n    you for your very kind reception of us, and I can only assure\r\n    you that it has given us the greatest pleasure to take part in\r\n    this very interesting ceremony, and that we wish the Exhibition\r\n    the most thorough success.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening, the Duke of Cambridge presided at a special festival, in\r\naid of rebuilding the British Home for Incurables at Clapham, which was\r\nheld in the Conservatory of the Anglo-Danish Exhibition. There was a\r\nnumerous attendance, and the donations to the building fund amounted to\r\nnearly £5000. This Institution, founded in 1861, provides home with\r\nevery comfort for hopelessly incurable sufferers (except the idiotic,\r\ninsane, and the blind, for whom there are other asylums), and also gives\r\npensions to out-patients of £20 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT NORTHERN HOSPITAL, HOLLOWAY ROAD.\r\n\r\n_July 17th, 1888._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales performed the ceremony of opening the new buildings\r\nof the Great Northern Hospital, at Islington, on the 17th of July, 1888.\r\nHe was accompanied by the Princess of Wales, and by the Princesses\r\nLouise, Victoria, and Maude. The event caused much interest in the\r\nnorthern part of London, and vast crowds filled the streets and roads.\r\nThe Rev. W. H. Barlow, Vicar of Islington, and many of the clergy, Mr.\r\nMurdoch, M.P., Chairman of the Hospital, and other official persons,\r\nreceived the Royal visitors in a gaily decorated tent. Their Royal\r\nHighnesses, however, were attired in deep mourning, on account of the\r\ndeath of the Emperor Frederick of Germany. An address was read, in which\r\nit was stated that Islington is the largest parish in England in\r\npopulation. At the beginning of the reign of the Queen it had 40,000\r\ninhabitants, now it has 320,000. The Great Northern Hospital was\r\nestablished in 1857, but in 1882 it was resolved to erect a building\r\nmore suitable for the increased population. The wish was to make the new\r\nhospital a thanksgiving memorial of the Jubilee year.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, in replying to the address, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ladies and Gentlemen,--I am most anxious, in my own name, and\r\n    also in that of the Princess, to acknowledge the most cordial\r\n    and kind words of the address which we have just heard read by\r\n    the Vestry Clerk, and also for the kind expressions which have\r\n    fallen from Mr. Murdoch. We are very glad to be able to take\r\n    part in so interesting a ceremony as this, and we are glad to\r\n    think that in so large and ever-increasing a population as this\r\n    in the North of London is, the project of commemorating the\r\n    Queen's Jubilee should have been so appropriately celebrated by\r\n    the building of a hospital. We shall shortly have an opportunity\r\n    of visiting the wards, and I have little doubt that we shall\r\n    find everything in the most admirable and efficient state.\r\n    Amongst the many duties we have to perform, none, I assure you,\r\n    ladies and gentlemen, gives us greater gratification and\r\n    pleasure than such a function as this, where we come to give our\r\n    assistance and support to a philanthropic object, and to a cause\r\n    the object of which is to alleviate the sufferings of our\r\n    fellow-creatures. I can only express the pleasure it has given\r\n    us to have it in our power to open this hospital to-day. You\r\n    are well aware how much we regretted that it was not in our\r\n    power to come here and open the hospital on the date originally\r\n    fixed. You are also aware of the cause, and I well know how much\r\n    you all sympathise with us and the other members of our family\r\n    in our sorrow and grief. I am glad to have the opportunity of\r\n    saying, on this public occasion, that my sister has felt deeply\r\n    that, although thirty years have elapsed since she left this\r\n    country, her compatriots have not forgotten her, and that they\r\n    have sympathised with her, that they have felt for her, in the\r\n    great and overwhelming sorrow which it has pleased God to\r\n    inflict upon her, I beg to thank you once more for your kind\r\n    reception of us to-day, and again to assure you of the sincere\r\n    gratification it has given us to be present.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince resumed his seat amidst loud cheers, and a number of children\r\nand young ladies then presented purses to the Princess, the names of the\r\ndonors being announced by the Secretary. The total of these\r\nsubscriptions was £1050. This ceremony being finished, their Royal\r\nHighnesses left the pavilion to visit the hospital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe opening of the new Northern hospital in London was the last public\r\nfunction performed by the Prince of Wales before his autumn visit to\r\nAustria and other regions of Southern Europe. With it our record of his\r\npresence at charitable institutions must close. It has been necessary to\r\nmake only a selection of his speeches on such occasions. The Hospital\r\nfor Sick Children, the Chelsea Hospital for Women, Queen Charlotte's\r\nLying-in Hospital, Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, the Holloway\r\nSanatorium at Virginia Water, the Cottage Homes at Weybridge, St. Mary's\r\nHospital, University and King's College Hospitals, the Fever Hospital;\r\nthese, and many other institutions for the help of the poor or the\r\nsuffering, have had the advantage of the Prince's advocacy.\r\n\r\nThere have been also many occasions where he has assisted by his\r\npresence or his voice other institutions for educational and\r\nphilanthropic objects, such as the Marine Society's ship \"Warspite,\" and\r\nthe training-ship \"Worcester,\" the Windsor and Eton Albert Institute,\r\nthe Church for the Deaf and Dumb, the Dwelling Houses for working people\r\nin Soho, the Alexandra Home at Kensington for Pupils at the Schools of\r\nArt and Music; besides more important educational and charitable\r\nestablishments, such as the St. Anne's Schools at Redhill, for children\r\nof the Clergy, and of others whose means are not equal to their position\r\nin life. To have given an account of the proceedings, and reports of\r\nthe speeches on all these occasions would have required the space of two\r\nvolumes instead of one.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason it is with regret that the Editor has to omit\r\ndescriptions of many important and interesting functions both in the\r\nMetropolis and throughout the country. The truth is there are few parts\r\nof England, certainly few of the great centres of population and\r\nindustry, which have not been visited by the Prince, generally\r\naccompanied by the Princess of Wales, for some purpose of local and\r\noften of national utility. Now it is at Birmingham, to open a new\r\nHospital or an Art Gallery. Now it is at Sheffield to open the Park,\r\nwhich was the munificent gift of its Mayor, Mark Firth. Now it is at\r\nYork, for opening the New Institute. Now it is at Leeds, for\r\ninaugurating the Art Exhibition; and at Leeds the Prince addressed an\r\naudience which included the Lord Mayors of London and York, and the\r\nMayors of almost every town in Yorkshire, in the Town Hall, opened many\r\nyears before by the Queen and the Prince Consort. Another year there was\r\na Royal visit to Lancashire, where a new Infirmary was opened at Wigan,\r\nan institution praised by the Prince as due as much to the gifts of the\r\nworking classes as to the liberality of the employers of labour in that\r\ngreat mining district. At Bolton, for the first time in its history\r\nhonoured by a Royal visit, the Prince opened the Town Hall, one of the\r\nfinest edifices of the kind in the provinces. At Hull the new Albert\r\nDock was opened, and new docks at Grimsby. Another time the Prince is\r\namong the agricultural people, at Dorchester for a Cattle Show, or at\r\nHunstanton for opening a Convalescent Hospital. Or he is at Newcastle,\r\nopening the Coble Dene Dock for the Tyne Commission. Or he is at\r\nSouthampton laying the foundation-stone of a new church for Canon\r\nWilberforce. Another time he is at Worcester, admiring with the Princess\r\nof Wales the splendid Porcelain Works, as well as the Cathedral and\r\nantiquities of the loyal city. Many other expeditions have been made\r\nduring these twenty-five years, and it is noteworthy that in places\r\nsupposed to be the most democratic and independent, as Birmingham and at\r\nSheffield, the reception of the Royal visitors was the most hearty and\r\nenthusiastic. Opening the Victoria Hall at Ealing on December the 15th\r\nwas the occasion of the latest public appearance in 1888. It adjoins the\r\nParish building, and the Free Library, to which the Prince alluded in\r\nhis brief speech.\r\n\r\nReference has not been made to occasions of a private kind, such as\r\nRegimental and Club Dinners, where the presence of the Prince is always\r\nwelcomed, and what he says is remembered, though not reported. Perhaps\r\nit is right to mention the Savage Club, of which many Press reporters\r\nare members, and where the Prince made one of his genial addresses, and\r\ndrew from the Club very acceptable aid towards founding the Musical\r\nScholarships in which he was then interested.\r\n\r\nAny one who could see the engagement book of the Prince of Wales during\r\na season would think there is little exaggeration when it is said he is\r\none of the most busy and hard-working of public men. If it cannot be\r\nsaid _nulla dies sine lineâ_, there are few days on which some important\r\nbusiness has not to be attended to, besides his personal or private\r\naffairs in town and country. In one of his early addresses, he said\r\nthat, being excluded by his position from taking active part in\r\npolitical life, he would devote his time to \"duties connected with works\r\nof charity and of public utility.\" How far this resolution has been\r\ncarried out, the readers of this volume have the means of judging.\r\n\r\nIn many of his speeches the Prince has, in grateful and touching terms,\r\nreferred to the useful and beneficent services rendered by his revered\r\nand lamented father, whose example he desires to follow. That example\r\nalso influenced the character and the life of the late Emperor of\r\nGermany, \"Frederick the Noble.\" In the introduction to the brief\r\nbiographical memoir of 'Frederick, Crown Prince and Emperor,' recently\r\npublished by Mr. Rennell Rodd, the widowed Empress--our own Princess\r\nRoyal--expresses a hope that the book will make his name better known to\r\nthe English public, and give him a place in their affections beside that\r\nof her father, the Prince Consort, \"for whom he had so great love,\r\nadmiration, and veneration.\" The words of Lord Tennyson are thus\r\nrecalled with new power:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dear to thy land and ours; a Prince indeed\r\n    Beyond all titles, and a household name\r\n    Hereafter through all times--ALBERT THE GOOD.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECHES AT ROYAL ACADEMY BANQUETS.\r\n\r\n[Blank Page]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECHES AT ROYAL ACADEMY BANQUETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of the Prince of Wales at the annual dinner of the\r\nRoyal Academy, with the short speech made on the occasion, has been\r\ngiven under the date, May 4th, 1863. In many subsequent years the Prince\r\nhas been a welcome and honoured guest, and has been called to address\r\nthe company. Instead of giving these speeches in the years when they\r\nwere delivered, it seems better to group them together. The guests at\r\nthe banquet are in the main the same year by year. After the Royal and\r\nofficial personages, and notable public men always present, and the\r\nAcademicians and their friends, there remains not much room for variety\r\nin the invitations. If any very distinguished stranger is in London at\r\nthe time, or some hero of the day, he is pretty certain to be invited,\r\nand the speech of such a guest is a distinctive feature in the yearly\r\nrecord of the banquets. There is also effort made to secure some\r\neloquent speakers to reply to some of the toasts given from the Chair.\r\nBut on the whole there is considerable sameness in the reports, the same\r\ntoasts being always given, and often the same speakers responding. The\r\nPrince of Wales has been more than once complimented for his being able\r\nto find fresh material for his speeches at these dinners. The simple art\r\nin effecting this is that he takes some topic which is before the public\r\nat the time, or refers to his own public acts, which interest the\r\naudience on account of his personal popularity. We cannot give all the\r\nspeeches on these occasions, but the following show the general spirit\r\nof them, and the variety of subjects touched by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1866._\r\n\r\nAt the banquet of 1866, on the 5th of May, the President, Sir Francis\r\nGrant, then recently elected, for the first time occupied the chair. In\r\nproposing the health of the Prince of Wales, Sir Francis wished to his\r\nRoyal guest, \"amidst the cares and labours of his exalted station, all\r\nthe soothing influences of a love of art. He inherits the enlightened\r\nappreciation of art, which had distinguished both his illustrious\r\nparents. But the title of artist is not confined to the subjects which\r\noccupy the Royal Academicians. In England, especially in the Midland\r\ncounties, a gentleman who particularly distinguishes himself in riding\r\nacross country after hounds is popularly called an artist. Gentlemen,\"\r\ncontinued the President, himself an artist of high repute in both senses\r\nof the word, \"I am able to assure you from my own personal observation,\r\nand I feel sure his Grace the Duke of Rutland will bear me out, that His\r\nRoyal Highness in his recent visit to Leicestershire, in two very severe\r\nruns across the Vale of Belvoir, proved himself a first-rate artist in\r\nthat particular department of art. Since His Royal Highness has proved\r\nhimself in one sense an artist, may I, if His Royal Highness will\r\nforgive my boldness, claim his sympathy for his brother artists of the\r\nbrush? Allow me to add, the brush is an important element in both\r\ndepartments of art. I beg to say on the occasion alluded to His Royal\r\nHighness was most deservedly presented with the brush. I have the honour\r\nto propose 'The health of their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess\r\nof Wales and the other members of the Royal Family.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in responding, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Francis Grant, your Royal Highnesses, my Lords, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--I thank you most sincerely for the very kind manner\r\n    in which you have proposed my health, that of the Princess of\r\n    Wales, and the other members of the Royal Family, and for the\r\n    cordial manner in which it has been received. I need hardly\r\n    assure you that it is a source of sincere gratification for me\r\n    to be present a second time at the annual dinner of the Royal\r\n    Academy, more especially as I am enabled to have the opportunity\r\n    of supporting you, Sir Francis, on the first occasion that you\r\n    take the chair as President of the Royal Academy. Although we\r\n    are assembled on a festive occasion, I cannot omit referring to\r\n    the memory of one whose loss we must all deeply deplore. I\r\n    allude to your late President, Sir Charles Eastlake. You Royal\r\n    Academicians all knew him so well, and how justly popular he was\r\n    for his many distinguished qualities, that it would be\r\n    superfluous for me to pass any eulogy on his name. But I cannot\r\n    forbear offering my small tribute to his merits, having always\r\n    considered him as an old friend, and having known him, indeed,\r\n    since my childhood. I now take the opportunity of thanking you,\r\n    Sir Francis, for the very kind manner in which you have adverted\r\n    to me in connection with art. I need not assure you that I shall\r\n    always be most ready to do my little best in assisting to\r\n    promote the welfare of art and science, and thus following the\r\n    bright example of the Queen and my lamented father. I thank you,\r\n    also, for the allusion you made to me as a brother of the\r\n    'brush.' Although, as I observed before, I will do my utmost to\r\n    support art, still I am afraid I shall never be able to compete\r\n    with you as a painter, but at the same time I shall always be\r\n    ready to enter the lists with you in the hunting field as long\r\n    as you do not attempt to ride over me at the first fence. With\r\n    respect to the present Exhibition, it may, I think, be said that\r\n    the pictures in a great measure not only show the progress of\r\n    art, but record the times in which we live. Taken as a whole,\r\n    the Exhibition is one of a peaceful character, and indicative of\r\n    peace. There is only one picture to which I would refer which,\r\n    at the present moment, bears anything of a warlike character--I\r\n    mean 'Volunteers at a firing point,' in which there is a picture\r\n    of a distinguished Highlander (Mr. Ross), a countryman of your\r\n    own, who is represented as shooting for a prize. That is a very\r\n    interesting picture, and it reminds us forcibly that the\r\n    Volunteers who came forward for the protection of their country\r\n    have not been required in that capacity, and are now employing\r\n    their time usefully in the art of rifle shooting. Without\r\n    further trespassing on your time, permit me once more to thank\r\n    you for the manner in which you have proposed and drunk my\r\n    health.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge, in responding to the toast of the Army, referred\r\nto the distinction in art attained by the President, the brother of one\r\nalready highly distinguished in arms, his friend Sir Hope Grant. Prince\r\nAlfred responded for the Navy.\r\n\r\nAn interesting fact, not generally known, was mentioned by Sir Francis\r\nGrant, who had been called the successor of Sir Charles Eastlake. Sir\r\nEdwin Landseer had been elected; and, although he could be only\r\npersuaded to retain the office for one week, the Academy had the proud\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that his name is registered among its\r\nPresidents.\r\n\r\nThe other speeches at this banquet were of unusual interest, from the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, Earl Russell, and the Earl of Derby. Allusions\r\nwere made to the loss of Lord Palmerston, and of Mr. Gibson, the\r\nsculptor, and also to the approaching marriage of the Princess Mary of\r\nCambridge, for whom the Duke of Teck responded. The Earl of Derby made\r\nspecial reference to the National Exhibition of Portraits at South\r\nKensington, interesting alike to the artist and to the student of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1867._\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the customary loyal toasts were proposed and responded to,\r\nthe President making special reference to the severe and protracted\r\nillness of the Princess of Wales, which they all deplored, with the\r\ntrust that it would please God soon to restore her to perfect health.\r\nThe Prince, on rising, was loudly applauded, and spoke with evident\r\nemotion, in witnessing the warm sympathy shown by the assembly:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Francis Grant, your Royal Highness, my Lords, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--I beg to tender you my warmest thanks for the very\r\n    kind manner in which you have proposed and received the health\r\n    of the Princess of Wales and myself. I feel sure she will be\r\n    deeply gratified for the kind words you have this evening\r\n    uttered, and I am glad to say that, although she has now for\r\n    very nearly two months been kept to her room by a long and\r\n    tedious illness, she is now progressing towards recovery. I know\r\n    I can have no more pleasing announcement to make to her Royal\r\n    Highness than to tell her of the very kind feeling which has\r\n    always been exhibited to her since her first coming to this\r\n    country. I beg also, Sir Francis, to thank you for the very kind\r\n    manner in which you have alluded to the interest I take with\r\n    regard to science and art. I need not tell you that I do take\r\n    such an interest. If I may say so, I take the same interest\r\n    which my parents have always taken, although I may not have the\r\n    same experience or knowledge; still, I hope I shall always tread\r\n    in their footsteps in that respect.\r\n\r\n    \"I am flattered, Sir Francis, by your statement that I have\r\n    shown an appreciation of art in becoming the possessor of a work\r\n    by so celebrated an artist as Sir Edwin Landseer. I think it\r\n    would be impossible to find at this table any one who would not\r\n    feel the same appreciation of so admirable a work of art. I\r\n    obtained the picture under somewhat peculiar circumstances. It\r\n    had been painted for a private person who was kind enough to\r\n    give it up to me. Sir Edwin Landseer, although he has been\r\n    before the public for many years as a painter, has within the\r\n    last two months achieved great distinction as a sculptor, and\r\n    has produced one of the finest monuments of art that exist in\r\n    this country. He kept us perhaps some time in waiting for his\r\n    lions, but the result has certainly been a most magnificent\r\n    one.\r\n\r\n    \"With reference to the Exhibition now before us, I think I may\r\n    say that for many years we have not seen a finer exhibition. The\r\n    names of Grant, Watts, Millais, and others I need not\r\n    particularise. Last year we had to mourn the loss of Sir C.\r\n    Eastlake, and now we have to lament the departure from among us\r\n    of another Royal Academician, Mr. Philip, to the vivid\r\n    truthfulness of whose pictures from Spanish life I myself, from\r\n    having been in Spain, can amply testify. I beg, my lords and\r\n    gentlemen, again to thank you for the kind manner in which you\r\n    have proposed and received my health, and the still kinder\r\n    manner in which you have received the health of the Princess of\r\n    Wales.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_1870._\r\n\r\nThe Royal Academy banquet for 1870 fell on the 30th of April.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Grant, the President, in proposing \"The Health of the\r\nQueen,\" stated that Her Majesty had, in May of the previous year,\r\nconferred on the Academy the honour of visiting the new galleries in\r\nstate, and was pleased to express her high approval. At that visit she\r\ngave commissions for pictures to several young artists of rising fame;\r\nand she presented to the Academy the beautiful marble bust of herself,\r\nexecuted by her accomplished daughter the Princess Louise.\r\n\r\nIn next proposing \"The Health of the Prince and Princess of Wales and\r\nthe rest of the Royal Family,\" the President said that they were all\r\nglad to welcome the Prince, for the first time, in the new galleries.\r\n\"Last year His Royal Highness was well employed elsewhere visiting the\r\nhistoric wonders of ancient Egypt, accompanied by the Princess of Wales,\r\nwhom we must all rejoice to see returned to this country in perfect\r\nhealth. It must be a gratifying circumstance to all Her Majesty's loyal\r\nsubjects that the Royal Princes, her sons, are not too delicately\r\nreared, as Princes were of old, but are all manly English gentlemen and\r\ngreat travellers, who seek to elevate and enlarge their minds by\r\nstudying the customs and policy of foreign nations, and to strengthen\r\nthe cords of sympathy and loyalty which bind our colonies to the mother\r\ncountry. I read with pleasure of His Royal Highness recently presiding\r\nat a meeting of the Society of Arts, and the able sentiments he then\r\nexpressed on the subject of education. I am glad also to learn that the\r\nPrince has succeeded the late lamented Lord Derby as President of the\r\nRoyal Commission of 1851--an institution, if I may so call it, which has\r\ndone such great things for the progress of art, especially in connection\r\nwith manufactures, and which owes so much, I might say entirely its\r\ngreat success, to the enlightened genius and active support of the\r\nPrince's illustrious father.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who was received with much\r\ncheering, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President, your Royal Highness, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I\r\n    beg to tender you my warmest thanks for the kind way in which\r\n    this toast has been proposed and received. It has afforded me\r\n    great gratification once more to attend the hospitable board of\r\n    the Royal Academy, and especially as I have this evening for the\r\n    first time had the pleasure of dining in these new rooms. As the\r\n    President has remarked, he was kind enough last year to invite\r\n    me to inaugurate these rooms, but, being abroad, I was\r\n    unfortunately unable to do so. I regret it, especially as that\r\n    was the one hundredth anniversary of the Royal Academy. I think\r\n    I may be allowed to congratulate the President and all the Royal\r\n    Academicians on the Exhibition of this year. Of course, every\r\n    artist strives each succeeding year to produce still better\r\n    pictures and statues, and I think the Academicians have no\r\n    reason to complain on the present occasion. We must regret, as I\r\n    am sure all Academicians will, the death of Mr. Maclise, and it\r\n    is with feelings of sorrow that we shall now for the last time\r\n    see a picture of his adorn these walls. The President has kindly\r\n    alluded to me as having recently presided at a meeting of the\r\n    Society of Arts, and I cannot but thank him for the compliment\r\n    he has paid me in connection with the observations I made upon\r\n    that occasion. It afforded me great pleasure to preside at that\r\n    meeting, and, although my position as President of the Society\r\n    is to a certain extent an honorary one, I promise that I shall\r\n    be ready on every occasion to come forward and give as much time\r\n    as I can in promoting any of its very important objects. I beg\r\n    also to thank the President for having alluded to me as\r\n    President of the Commission of 1851. It is with deep regret that\r\n    I have had to succeed one whose presence we must all miss on\r\n    occasions like these--one whose name can never be forgotten in\r\n    the country's history, and who always took the highest interest\r\n    in the welfare of all our great institutions, and more\r\n    especially those connected with art--I allude to the late\r\n    lamented Lord Derby. My lords and gentlemen, I assure you the\r\n    Princess of Wales will be highly gratified to hear how kindly on\r\n    this, as on every other public occasion, you have received her\r\n    name and health, and I beg to thank you for the kind manner in\r\n    which you have listened to the few remarks I have made.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual toasts were afterwards given, and responded to by eminent men,\r\nincluding Mr. Motley, the American Minister, and Charles Dickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1871._\r\n\r\nAt the Royal Academy banquet of 1871, the President, Sir Francis Grant,\r\nin proposing \"The Health of Her Majesty the Queen,\" referred to the\r\nrecent opening of the Albert Hall, a proceeding which, in some degree,\r\ntended towards the realisation of the late Prince Consort's constant\r\nefforts for the promotion of Science and Art in this kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn proposing \"The Health of the Prince and Princess of Wales and the\r\nrest of the Royal family,\" Sir Francis referred to the zeal of the\r\nPrince in the encouragement of Art, and said that he was shortly to\r\npreside on two different occasions in connection with Art, at the\r\nopening of the International Exhibition, and at the dinner of the\r\nArtists' General Benevolent Institution.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in responding, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I feel very much touched by the kind way in which you, Sir\r\n    Francis, proposed my health, and this company received it, and I\r\n    beg also to thank you for the very kind terms in which you\r\n    alluded to the name of the Princess, who, I am confident, will\r\n    be deeply gratified by the kind way in which you alluded to her\r\n    name and the company have received this toast. You have referred\r\n    to the opening of the International Exhibition next Monday, and\r\n    I sincerely trust that the opening of that series of Exhibitions\r\n    may be as successful as the others which preceded it, and that\r\n    the promotion of science and art may be carried forward by the\r\n    means of these numerous Exhibitions. It is always a great\r\n    pleasure for me to meet you here at this annual gathering, to\r\n    see so many distinguished and celebrated persons, and to be\r\n    surrounded on all sides by the pictures of the most celebrated\r\n    artists of our own country, and also, by the permission of the\r\n    Academicians, by the pictures of the most distinguished foreign\r\n    artists. I feel sure that the artists of this country take it as\r\n    a great compliment that these pictures should be sent here for\r\n    exhibition. With respect to the present Exhibition, it must\r\n    strike all of us on looking around these walls that some\r\n    pictures are wanting--pictures from an artist whose health, I\r\n    fear, is failing, although I am sure we all hope most heartily\r\n    he may yet be spared to us; still we do miss the pictures of Sir\r\n    Edwin Landseer. Gratifying as it must be for distinguished\r\n    artists to see their pictures exhibited, and to hear the remarks\r\n    made on them by critics and others, there are two beautiful\r\n    drawings in this Exhibition of which, alas! the artists will\r\n    never hear the praise that may be bestowed upon them, and I feel\r\n    sure that it will not be considered out of place if on this\r\n    occasion I offer my condolence to the Royal Academicians for the\r\n    absence of one of their number, and the cause of it in the\r\n    terrible bereavement he has sustained (alluding to the death of\r\n    the son of Mr. Goodall, R.A.). My lords and gentlemen, I thank\r\n    you for listening to these few remarks, and as many speeches\r\n    have to be made I will not trespass further upon your attention\r\n    than by again thanking you for the very kind manner in which my\r\n    health and that of the Princess have been received by this\r\n    distinguished assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_1874._\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of the evening was in the speech of Sir Garnet\r\nWolseley, the \"hero of Coomassie.\" His health was proposed by the Prince\r\nof Wales, who said he would have preferred that the toast should have\r\nbeen given by some one better qualified, but that he felt it a pleasure\r\nand honour to fulfil the duty laid on him by the President.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge, in responding for the Army and Navy, had in very\r\nhappy terms also referred to the services of Sir Garnet Wolseley, who in\r\nhis speech gave well-merited praise to the Commander-in-Chief, for his\r\nefforts to raise the standard of military education.\r\n\r\nReturning to earlier proceedings of the evening, the President of the\r\nAcademy, Sir Francis Grant, in proposing \"The Health of the Prince and\r\nthe Princess of Wales and the other members of the Royal Family,\"\r\nsaid:--\"It is a subject of infinite satisfaction to the members of the\r\nRoyal Academy to observe the unmistakable and earnest love of art which\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales manifests on all occasions.\r\nNotwithstanding the numerous calls that are made on the time of His\r\nRoyal Highness, to which he assiduously responds, we learn through the\r\nPress of his occasionally visiting the studios of some of our leading\r\nartists, thus honouring and encouraging Art in the most gratifying\r\nmanner. We have also to thank the Prince for the active assistance he\r\ngave us in promoting the success of the Landseer Exhibition. It was\r\nowing to his personal influence that we are enabled to thank his\r\nMajesty the King of the Belgians for two beautiful pictures sent from\r\nthe royal collection at Brussels, and also his Serene Highness the Duke\r\nof Coburg, who sent from Coburg one work of great interest, and besides\r\nseveral other valuable pictures, one of Van Amburgh and the Lions, the\r\nproperty of his Grace the Duke of Wellington, a picture that possesses\r\nthis special interest, that the subject was suggested and the picture\r\ncommissioned by the Duke's illustrious father. I am glad to be able to\r\nannounce that the Prince and Princess of Wales, accompanied by the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Edinburgh and the other members of the Royal Family,\r\nhonoured the Exhibition with their presence on Thursday. I hope the\r\nPrince will forgive me for the liberty I take, if I venture to mention\r\nthat we members of the Academy always witness with pleasure the honest\r\nand zealous way in which both the Prince and Princess go over the\r\nExhibition, beginning catalogue with pencil in hand, at No. 1, and\r\nworking steadily through all the galleries. It cannot but be gratifying,\r\neven to the humblest artist who is so fortunate as to obtain a place on\r\nthese walls, to know that he has good reason to hope that his labours\r\nwill not escape the observation of the Prince and Princess of Wales.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who was received with much\r\ncheering, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President, your Royal Highness, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I\r\n    beg to thank you for the very kind manner in which you, Sir\r\n    Francis, have proposed my health with that of the Princess of\r\n    Wales and the other members of the Royal Family, and for the\r\n    cordial way in which you, my lords and gentlemen, have been\r\n    pleased to receive it. I can assure you, Sir Francis, and the\r\n    members of the Royal Academy, that it affords me the greatest\r\n    pleasure and satisfaction to have been able to accept your kind\r\n    invitation. It is now two years since I had the opportunity of\r\n    partaking of your hospitality, and you may be sure that whenever\r\n    I am able to come to the Royal Academy it will always give me\r\n    the greatest pleasure. Sir Francis Grant has been kind enough to\r\n    allude to me with reference to the Exhibition at the Royal\r\n    Academy of pictures by his late distinguished and\r\n    never-to-be-surpassed colleague, Sir Edwin Landseer. I will only\r\n    say that any efforts of mine--the efforts were but small, but\r\n    such as they were, any efforts I could make--were most\r\n    cheerfully devoted to give the country the opportunity of seeing\r\n    those magnificent works, some of which, having for many years\r\n    been in the possession of their proprietors, had not been\r\n    placed before the eyes of the public. It gave me very great\r\n    pleasure to help in any way such an exhibition. Thanks to the\r\n    efforts of the President and the members of the Royal Academy,\r\n    that exhibition was a great success, and afforded the utmost\r\n    interest and pleasure to all who saw it. I feel assured that you\r\n    must all deeply deplore the loss of that great man. Last year he\r\n    was still living, though, alas! his health was such that it was\r\n    impossible for him to come among his colleagues as he used to\r\n    do. At any rate, he lived to render his name illustrious, and we\r\n    can never hope to see his fame excelled. Sir Francis, I hope you\r\n    will allow me to congratulate you on this most excellent\r\n    Exhibition. When we see these walls surrounded with\r\n    pictures--when we look at the catalogue and see the names of\r\n    yourself, of Messrs. Millais, Leighton, Prinsep, Watts, Ward,\r\n    Frith, Graves, Calderon, Sant, Alma-Tadema, and many others I\r\n    might mention, it is unnecessary to say that we have here a\r\n    collection of pictures of the greatest artists which this\r\n    country can produce. I am glad to take this opportunity of\r\n    saying that I hope those gentlemen who have come to the Royal\r\n    Academy on this occasion have not forgotten to look at one\r\n    picture in the next room, which I think well deserves attention.\r\n    It is numbered 142 in the catalogue, and is entitled 'Calling\r\n    the Roll after an Engagement in the Crimea.' This picture,\r\n    painted by a young lady who, I am given to understand, is not\r\n    yet twenty-three, is deserving of the highest admiration, and I\r\n    am sure she has before her a great future as an artist. In the\r\n    next room, the Lecture Room, is a statue of 'A Horse and his\r\n    Master,' by Boehm, which I am confident all who take an interest\r\n    in sculpture will agree with me is one of the finest pieces of\r\n    sculpture of modern times. The name of the artist is so well\r\n    known that it is superfluous for me to make any remarks upon it.\r\n    I only hope that at no very distant day he will have the\r\n    privilege of writing R.A. after his name. My lords and\r\n    gentlemen, I beg to thank you for the very kind way in which\r\n    this toast has been proposed and accepted by this distinguished\r\n    company.\"\r\n\r\nThe marked way in which the Prince called attention to the now\r\ncelebrated picture of \"The Roll Call\" was a generous tribute to rising\r\nmerit. The young artist thus signalised has more than fulfilled the\r\nanticipations formed of her. The name of Elizabeth Thompson soon became\r\ndistinguished in Art, and she continues to excel in depicting military\r\nscenes, now that her name, Lady Butler, is associated with that of a\r\nmost gallant and distinguished officer, Sir William Butler, K.C.B. The\r\npraise bestowed on \"The Roll Call\" by the Duke of Cambridge was equally\r\nhearty, and was a high compliment as coming from the head of the British\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May, 1875._\r\n\r\nThe President, Sir Francis Grant, in proposing \"The Health of the\r\nQueen,\" referred to Her Majesty's constant and cordial encouragement of\r\nArt. \"In carrying out our Winter Exhibition of the Ancient Masters, Her\r\nMajesty has always given us her cordial support; and I hope I may be\r\nallowed to remind you that last year, when we held an exhibition\r\nexclusively of the works of the late Sir Edwin Landseer, the Queen was\r\nso kind as to contribute no fewer than sixty works by that eminent\r\nartist. For that and other gracious acts the Academy desire to record\r\ntheir grateful acknowledgments.\"\r\n\r\nOn giving the toast of \"The Prince and Princess of Wales and the other\r\nmembers of the Royal Family,\" Sir Francis Grant said:--\"I beg to assure\r\nHis Royal Highness that the members of the Royal Academy are very\r\nsensible of the honour he confers on us by his presence on this as on\r\nmany former occasions. They especially value the compliment as an\r\nadditional proof of the interest His Royal Highness has at all times\r\nmanifested in the promotion and encouragement of Art. I am glad to say\r\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales, accompanied by the Duke and Duchess of\r\nEdinburgh and other members of the Royal Family, honoured the Exhibition\r\nwith their presence on Thursday, and after their usual careful\r\nexamination of the works of Art were pleased to express their\r\napprobation. We cannot but be impressed by the cordial and zealous\r\nmanner in which both the Princess and the Prince fulfil the many onerous\r\nduties which devolve on their exalted position. We can scarcely take up\r\na newspaper without reading of their Royal Highnesses performing some\r\npublic duty or lending their presence for the support of some charitable\r\ninstitution, combining as they do this honourable desire to do good with\r\nthe most gracious manner--a graciousness which, I venture to say, does\r\nnot proceed from mere courtly education, but from the genuine impulses\r\nof good and noble natures.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with all the honours, and His Royal Highness, who\r\nwas received with much cheering, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--For the exceedingly kind manner in\r\n    which my health and that of the Princess of Wales have been\r\n    proposed by you, Sir Francis, and received by the company here\r\n    present allow me to return my most sincere thanks. The President\r\n    of the Royal Academy and the Royal Academicians may be assured\r\n    that it affords us the greatest pleasure on all occasions to\r\n    come to the Royal Academy, to attend their annual Exhibition. I\r\n    am sure, Sir Francis, that you and your brother Academicians\r\n    have no cause to complain of the Exhibition this year. I am\r\n    certain that all who have any knowledge of Art will agree with\r\n    me that this is a very fine Exhibition, in no way inferior to\r\n    any of its predecessors. For myself, I will only say that it\r\n    affords me the greatest gratification to be present on an\r\n    occasion when one meets with the most distinguished men--men of\r\n    the highest position and talent, surrounded by all that is most\r\n    beautiful in Art. I beg to return my best acknowledgments for\r\n    the kind manner in which you have received the health of the\r\n    Princess of Wales, of myself, and of the other members of the\r\n    Royal Family, and I sincerely hope, that on many future\r\n    occasions I may have the happiness to be present at the annual\r\n    gatherings of the Royal Academy.\"\r\n\r\nIn responding for the Army, the Duke of Cambridge referred with high\r\npraise to the picture of \"The Last Muster,\" and also to that of the\r\nyoung lady who has again distinguished herself by a military picture,\r\n\"The Square of the 28th Regiment at the Battle of Quatre Bras,\" and also\r\nthe picture by a foreign artist in another room delineating an historic\r\n\"Charge at Waterloo.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Navy, the President said that Mr. Brassey had\r\npresented to the nation the fine picture of the _Devastation_. \"I\r\nbelieve,\" said Sir Francis, \"this is the first representation of an\r\nironclad that has found a place on these walls--a picture of the\r\n_Devastation_--of which the genius of the talented artist has made quite\r\na picturesque object by concealing more than half the vessel in smoke,\r\nand adorning what remains with a variety of flags.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_1879._\r\n\r\nAfter having missed the anniversary festival at Burlington House for\r\nfour years, mainly on account of pressing work, partly in connection\r\nwith Art, the Prince of Wales honoured the President and Council by his\r\npresence on the 3rd of May, 1879. There was the customary number of\r\nRoyal and distinguished guests, but another President now filled the\r\nChair, and other changes were witnessed among the Academicians.\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Leighton, in proposing \"The Health of the Queen,\" said\r\nthat, \"as members of the Royal Academy, we acclaim in this toast the\r\nhead and immediate patron of this institution--a patron whose patronage\r\nhas been for forty years not formal merely, but whose interest in its\r\nwell-being has constantly shown and still shows itself in acts of\r\ngracious and enlightened generosity and high examples of support, a\r\ngenerosity and support the fruits of which were but a few weeks ago\r\nagain magnificently evident on our walls. Deep gratitude, therefore,\r\nmingles with loyalty in the toast which I have now the honour to\r\npropose--'The Health of Her Majesty the Queen.'\"\r\n\r\nThe President said of the Prince of Wales, that \"his absence for a time\r\nhad not been caused by any diminution of the interest which he has ever\r\nevinced in this Academy and in the arts which are its care, but, on the\r\ntwo last occasions at least, by the performance of self-imposed and\r\nonerous duties in which the furtherance of English Art had no small\r\nshare. Those who had the honour to co-operate with His Royal Highness in\r\nthe work to which I allude--and not a few are seated at this table--know\r\nby experience with what steadfast zeal and devotion and with what\r\ninexhaustible kindness in his dealings with all he carried it out; but\r\nno one, perhaps, so well as myself knows how desirous the Prince of\r\nWales has been throughout that English Art should receive at the\r\nInternational Exhibition that recognition and honour which in his view\r\nit deserved, and which in the event was measured out to it by the\r\nopinion of Europe.\" The Princess of Wales, as all knew, co-operated with\r\nnever-failing grace with the Prince in fulfilling the duties of their\r\nhigh station. As to the other members of the Royal Family, \"all had\r\ngrown up in the love of arts, and several of them practise one or other\r\nof those arts with enthusiasm and with marked success. I give 'The\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales, and the rest of the Royal Family.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in responding, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Frederick Leighton, your Royal Highnesses, my Lords, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--I am very grateful for the excessively kind manner\r\n    in which this toast has been proposed and received by this large\r\n    and distinguished company. As the President, Sir Frederick\r\n    Leighton, has said, it is four years since I last had the\r\n    advantage of being present at your annual celebration. It was a\r\n    matter of great regret to me that so long a time should elapse,\r\n    but it has given me great pleasure to come here to-night and\r\n    take part in your proceedings. During those four years events\r\n    have occurred in the history of the Royal Academy which have\r\n    awakened deep regret. The members of the Royal Academy--I may\r\n    say all who sit at these tables--feel that they lost a friend in\r\n    the death of Sir Francis Grant, who so long presided with so\r\n    much geniality and kindness at these anniversaries. But of the\r\n    Academy, as of Royalty, it may be said, '_Le Roi est mort! Vive\r\n    le Roi!_' The President is dead; another President is elected.\r\n    Sir Frederick Leighton is an old friend of mine--a friend of\r\n    upwards of twenty years' standing. I congratulate him most\r\n    cordially and sincerely on the high office he now holds. I may\r\n    also congratulate the Royal Academy on having such a man to\r\n    preside over their meetings.\r\n\r\n    \"I have to return my thanks, and those of my colleagues, to Sir\r\n    F. Leighton for the able assistance he has rendered during the\r\n    recent International Exhibition in Paris. Your President was\r\n    unanimously elected chairman of the Section of Fine Arts, and he\r\n    presided over a jury of at least forty members, and I think we\r\n    have every reason to congratulate ourselves on the results.\r\n\r\n    \"Let me now congratulate you, Sir Frederick, and the Royal\r\n    Academy generally, on the magnificent Exhibition which we see\r\n    before us this evening. I have not yet had sufficient time to\r\n    enable me to speak to its merits, but I hope on some future\r\n    occasion to have the opportunity of going over it more\r\n    carefully. I thank you again for the kind way in which my health\r\n    and that of the Princess of Wales have been proposed and for the\r\n    very warm reception you have given me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge, in responding for the Army, referred to wars now\r\nbeing carried on in different parts of the world. He also spoke with\r\npraise of two pictures in this year's Exhibition by Miss Thompson. Mr.\r\nW. H. Smith spoke for the Navy. Lord Beaconsfield responded for Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers, Mr. Froude for Literature, the Lord Chief Justice\r\nfor the Guests, and the Lord Mayor for the Corporation of London. The\r\nLord Chief Justice (Sir Alexander Cockburn) gave an eloquent description\r\nof the chief works of Sir Frederick Leighton, beginning with the\r\n\"Procession of Cimabue,\" nearly a quarter of a century ago, from which\r\nmen felt that \"a new genius had arisen who was to add to the lustre and\r\nrenown of British Art.\" Sir Frederick Leighton, in his concluding\r\nspeech, paid a generous tribute to the memory of Sir Francis Grant, and\r\nalso of Mr. E. M. Ward, in whom the Academy had lost \"one of the few\r\nartists who made the history of our country a constant subject for\r\nstudy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_1880._\r\n\r\nAt the annual banquet in 1880, the President, Sir Frederick Leighton,\r\npaid to the Prince of Wales a handsome compliment when he said: \"Sir,\r\nof the graces by which your Royal Highness has won and firmly retains\r\nthe affectionate attachment of Englishmen, none has operated more\r\nstrongly than the width of your sympathies; for there is no honourable\r\nsphere in which Englishmen move, no path of life in which they tread,\r\nwherein your Royal Highness has not, at some time, by graceful word or\r\ndeed, evinced an enlightened interest.\" Coming from Sir Frederick\r\nLeighton, this was not the mere language of flattery.\r\n\r\nIn replying, the Prince, after expressing his sincerest thanks, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Year by year the members of my family and myself receive\r\n    invitations to take part in the proceedings at this anniversary\r\n    banquet. You can therefore well understand that I find some\r\n    difficulty in replying to the toast. At the same time I can\r\n    assure the President and the members of the Academy that, though\r\n    year by year we visit these exhibitions and take part at these\r\n    banquets, the interest we take in them does not in any way\r\n    diminish. I may be allowed to congratulate him and his\r\n    colleagues on the very great success of this Exhibition. I had\r\n    the opportunity two or three days ago of going through these\r\n    rooms, and, though I do not profess to be in any way an art\r\n    critic, I am quite sure they have no reason to fear any\r\n    criticism upon the works of art which adorn these walls.\r\n\r\n    \"I have been charged by my brothers, who generally take part in\r\n    this day's proceedings, to express their great regret that they\r\n    have not been able to be present. My brother, the Duke of\r\n    Edinburgh, has been for the last five or six weeks absent on\r\n    duty in Ireland, where he is employed on an important and, I\r\n    trust, useful mission, not only as Admiral Superintendent of the\r\n    Naval Reserve, but in doing what he can to relieve the distress\r\n    which exists in Ireland. He has lately had the opportunity of\r\n    taking the supplies for distribution on the West Coast from that\r\n    gallant ship the _Constitution_, sent over by our American\r\n    cousins, so nobly and generously, to afford relief to their\r\n    distressed brethren in Ireland. In a letter I received from him\r\n    two days ago he says the distress still exists, and both food\r\n    and clothing are much wanted; in many instances the corn is not\r\n    yet sown. I will not touch more upon this topic, and I should\r\n    not have mentioned it had I not been particularly requested to\r\n    do so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_1881._\r\n\r\nAt the banquet of 1881, the most notable incident was the special toast\r\nin honour of Sir Frederick Roberts. The President, Sir Frederick\r\nLeighton, said that \"it was unusual at that table to single out a guest,\r\nhowever distinguished, when the profession to which he belongs has\r\nalready been made the subject of a toast. But the brilliant achievements\r\nof Sir Frederick Roberts, especially the now famous march from Cabul to\r\nCandahar, had stirred all hearts.\" Sir Frederick, while grateful for the\r\nhearty welcome, spoke of the services of Sir Donald Stewart, and said\r\nthat officers and men were all animated by one spirit--to do their duty,\r\nand to uphold the honour of their Queen and country.\r\n\r\nOther events, that had occurred since their last assembly, were touched\r\nupon by the Prince of Wales, in responding to the toast with which his\r\nname is usually associated at these banquets. He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is always a great gratification to myself and any other\r\n    members of our family who may be present to come to this annual\r\n    gathering of the Royal Academy, and we greatly regret when any\r\n    cause arises to prevent us being present. It is a matter of\r\n    great interest not only to be surrounded by all that is finest\r\n    in modern art, but also to meet so distinguished an assembly,\r\n    although we who come year by year find that gaps are made which\r\n    we must all deeply regret. One of the most recent of these has\r\n    been occasioned by the death of the great statesman just taken\r\n    from us, who but two years ago made in this room one of his most\r\n    eloquent speeches, which must be in the memory of all who were\r\n    then present, many of whom are here to-night. I will not allude\r\n    to the late Earl of Beaconsfield further than to say how\r\n    gratifying it is to see that fine portrait of him in the next\r\n    room, executed by one of our first artists, Mr. Millais. I might\r\n    also allude to the removal from among us of the late Lord Chief\r\n    Justice of England, opposite to whom I had often the pleasure of\r\n    sitting at this table. The Academy, I am sure, also deplores the\r\n    loss of Mr. Elmore, and Mr. Knight, who was many years\r\n    Secretary, and we must all sympathise with the Academy for the\r\n    loss they have thus sustained.\r\n\r\n    \"It is not for me on this occasion to offer any criticism on the\r\n    pictures which adorn these walls. I have only had the\r\n    opportunity of taking a very cursory glance at them, and even if\r\n    I were able I should not indulge in any critical remarks. But I\r\n    will say this--neither the President nor the members of the\r\n    Academy have any reason to deprecate fair and just criticism.\r\n    One of the greatest pictures in the Exhibition is the portrait\r\n    of the President, painted by himself. In this he has only\r\n    followed the example of some of the great masters, who painted\r\n    their own portraits. As there are so many more speeches to be\r\n    made--some of the greatest possible interest--I will not weary\r\n    you with more words. I will only again thank you, in my own\r\n    name, in the name of the Princess, and of my brothers who are\r\n    present, for your very kind reception.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge said the Artists' Corps was one of the smartest\r\nand most efficient in the Volunteer Army, and he was glad of the\r\nopportunity of paying this tribute to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1885._\r\n\r\nAt the banquet of 1885, the Prince of Wales was accompanied for the\r\nfirst time by Prince Albert Victor. In the speech in reply to the usual\r\ntoast from the Chair, the Prince referred to his being accompanied by\r\nhis son in a very different place from the Academy of Art.\r\n\r\n    \"You, sir\" (addressing the President), \"have kindly alluded to\r\n    our late visit to Ireland. I can only assure you that, if that\r\n    visit was a labour at all, it was a labour of love. We had for a\r\n    long time past looked forward to a fitting opportunity for once\r\n    more visiting Ireland, and we were glad to avail ourselves of\r\n    the opportunity recently afforded us. I was sure that on going\r\n    there we should meet with a kind and hearty reception, and such\r\n    was the case with very few exceptions. We received as kind and\r\n    loyal a reception as it could be the good fortune of any one to\r\n    meet with. You, sir, have touched upon a subject of interest to\r\n    us. My son and I had the opportunity of visiting, although the\r\n    time allowed us was too short to do all that we could have\r\n    wished to do, those districts of the town of Dublin in which the\r\n    houses, although they might have picturesqueness, were certainly\r\n    not calculated to promote the happiness and welfare of their\r\n    inhabitants. This reminds me that I have had the honour of\r\n    serving for upwards of a year on the Commission which has for\r\n    its object the improvement of the dwellings of the poorer\r\n    classes of this country. I will not anticipate our first report,\r\n    which will be shortly issued. I will only say before sitting\r\n    down that not only has it been to me a sincere pleasure and\r\n    satisfaction to have aided so important and valuable a work, but\r\n    I have had the advantage of working with some of the most\r\n    distinguished of my countrymen, some of whom are here to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge made touching reference to the death of General\r\nGordon. \"I feel that the remarks of the President call for a sympathetic\r\nsentiment on my part and that of the Army. The allusion to General\r\nGordon is one that touches the heart of every English soldier, from\r\nmyself down to the youngest soldier of us all. I can only deplore the\r\nfact that he is no longer among us, and that his brilliant career is now\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_1888._\r\n\r\nAt the banquet of 1888, the President, Sir Frederick Leighton, after the\r\ntoast of \"The Queen,\" in proposing \"The Prince and Princess of Wales and\r\nthe rest of the Royal Family,\" referred to this year being the \"Silver\r\nWedding,\" and also alluded to the anxiety then darkening the home of\r\n\"the Princess Royal of England,\" the Empress of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--This toast has been\r\n    proposed in far too flattering terms, but the words which have\r\n    fallen from Sir Frederick Leighton have not failed to touch me\r\n    deeply, as they also will touch the Princess. I thank you,\r\n    therefore, Mr. President, for the kind manner in which you have\r\n    given the toast, and you, gentlemen, for the way in which you\r\n    have received it. My coming here this evening marks, as it were,\r\n    a double anniversary. This is not only the year of my silver\r\n    wedding, which your President has kindly referred to, but it is\r\n    now just a quarter of a century ago since I first had the\r\n    pleasure and gratification of accepting the kind hospitality of\r\n    this great Academy. There have, no doubt, been many changes\r\n    during that interval in this body. Many illustrious and\r\n    distinguished members of the Academy have passed away; but,\r\n    while we cannot but regret them, we know that there has been no\r\n    lack of others to fill their places. When one thinks of the old\r\n    buildings in which we used to assemble, which are now devoted to\r\n    the purposes of the National Gallery, and when one sees this new\r\n    edifice, which has existed now for nineteen years, and the\r\n    beautiful objects that adorn its walls, one can form some idea\r\n    of the great progress that has been made in art in this country.\r\n    It is a remarkable fact that, although many new galleries are\r\n    constantly springing up, there appears to be no difficulty in\r\n    adorning their walls and filling them with pictures and\r\n    sculpture. In 1869, 3000 works of art were offered for\r\n    acceptance by this Academy; but this year, I am told, no less\r\n    than 9300 were sent in. Unfortunately, of that number upwards of\r\n    7000 had to be returned, because you have only room for 2000\r\n    odd. The responsibility which rests upon the President, and\r\n    especially upon that most hard-working and perhaps I may say\r\n    also best-abused body, the hanging committee, is very great, and\r\n    their labours increase as years go on. They, of course, cannot\r\n    give satisfaction to everybody; but those distinguished artists\r\n    who must be disappointed at not seeing their works upon these\r\n    walls may perhaps find some consolation in observing how very\r\n    high is the general standard of excellence attained by their\r\n    more fortunate brethren whose works have been accepted.\r\n\r\n    \"Before sitting down I wish to acknowledge on behalf of my\r\n    sister and her husband the kind sympathy which you, sir, have\r\n    expressed to-night in such feeling words. I wish it were\r\n    possible for me to give on this occasion greater hopes of the\r\n    life of one so near and dear to me, of one of such value, not\r\n    only to his own country, but, I maintain, to the world at large.\r\n    The recent news which we have received has been rather more\r\n    favourable, and God grant that such news may continue. At any\r\n    rate, as long as there is life there is hope. I thank you once\r\n    more, Mr. President, for the cordial terms in which you have\r\n    proposed my health and the kind way in which you have alluded to\r\n    the members of my family.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge, who has the pleasurable duty every year of\r\nresponding to the toast of the Army, must naturally feel increasing\r\ndifficulty in varying the subject of his discourses. He was, however,\r\nnever more happy in his remarks than at the banquet of 1888. \"Every year\r\nthat I come here,\" said the Duke, \"I feel more at home among you, and\r\nfor this reason, because I believe that there is great sympathy between\r\nartists and military men. It has been said that the services seem to\r\nsome extent out of place in a company composed of artists, because\r\nartists are concerned with art and science and peaceful pursuits; but I\r\nbelieve, on the other hand, that artists derive a great advantage from\r\nobserving our profession, because it supplies them with many subjects\r\nwhich they love to portray. And the military sentiment among artists is\r\nby no means to be considered as effaced. When I see what a splendid\r\ncorps of Volunteers the artists supply, I think I may claim them as one\r\nof the elements of strength which we should use should any emergency\r\narise. God forbid that it should ever arise; but, if it should, may the\r\nservices be in a condition to prevent danger from approaching this\r\ncountry.\" These last words form the burden of most of the wise and\r\npatriotic speeches which the Duke of Cambridge delivers at the Academy\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL BANQUETS AT TRINITY HOUSE.\r\n\r\n[Blank Page]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL BANQUETS AT THE TRINITY HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 2nd, 1866._\r\n\r\nThe Corporation of the Trinity House received its first charter in 1514,\r\nfrom King Henry VIII. It was then a guild or brotherhood for the\r\nencouragement of the science and art of navigation, and was first\r\nempowered to build lighthouses and erect beacons by an Act passed in the\r\nreign of Queen Elizabeth. This has gradually come to be the chief duty\r\nof the Corporation, and a very important one it is to a nation with such\r\nvast commerce. The Scottish coasts are under a separate Board, but all\r\nothers are under the charge of the Trinity House. The Mastership of the\r\nCompany has in recent times been an honourable post, held by Princes and\r\nStatesmen. Lord Liverpool was Master in 1816, and was followed by the\r\nMarquis Camden, the Duke of Clarence, afterwards William IV., the Duke\r\nof Wellington, the Prince Consort, and Lord Palmerston, since whose\r\ndeath the office has been held by the Duke of Edinburgh. The post was\r\noffered to the Prince of Wales, but was declined by him, in behalf of\r\nhis sailor brother, \"with graceful delicacy and characteristic\r\nmanliness,\" as Sir Frederick Arrow, the Deputy-Master said, in proposing\r\nhis health at the first banquet where he was a guest.\r\n\r\nThis first festival meeting after the election of the Duke of Edinburgh\r\nas Master took place on the 2nd of July, 1866. Among the guests were the\r\nKing of the Belgians, the Prince of Wales, the Premier and several\r\nmembers of the Cabinet, the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Mayor, and\r\nother distinguished persons. The guests were received by the Elder\r\nBrethren in the Court Room of the Corporation, a stately apartment,\r\nadorned with portraits of Royal personages and of former Masters.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Master proposed the health of \"Her Majesty the\r\nQueen,\" and then that of the \"King of the Belgians,\" who in his reply\r\nwarmly thanked a Corporation which rendered important services to all\r\nmaritime and commercial nations. In giving the toast of \"The Prince of\r\nWales, the Princess of Wales, and the other members of the Royal\r\nFamily,\" the Master said: \"It has never before been my pleasing duty to\r\npropose the health of my brother in his presence, and I should feel very\r\nshy if I were to make any remarks farther than that, as Master of your\r\nCorporation, and as his brother, I beg you to give him a most hearty\r\nwelcome.\"\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales said:--\r\n\r\n    \"May it please your Majesty, your Royal Highness, my Lords, and\r\n    Gentlemen,--Under any circumstances it would have been a source\r\n    of gratification to me to be present on such an occasion as\r\n    this, but more especially when I have been invited by my own\r\n    brother and have the pleasure of supporting him on the first\r\n    occasion of his taking the chair as Master of this Company.\r\n    Perhaps you will allow me on this occasion merely to mention\r\n    that, after the death of that distinguished and lamented\r\n    statesman whose loss we must always deplore, the office of\r\n    Master was most kindly offered to me by the Brethren of this\r\n    Company. I begged to decline--at least, I begged to offer the\r\n    suggestion that the office should be offered to my brother, who\r\n    was far more fit to undertake its duties. Among the\r\n    distinguished personages who are present on this occasion it is,\r\n    you will allow me to say, very gratifying to have the honour of\r\n    the presence of his Majesty the King of the Belgians. After the\r\n    very kind manner in which he has spoken of his attachment to\r\n    this country, which I know is a real attachment, and not merely\r\n    a form of words, because I have often heard the same sentiment\r\n    expressed by him in private--after such expressions from his\r\n    Majesty I think I may say that we as Englishmen feel a strong\r\n    attachment to his country--a country distinguished in its own\r\n    position among the nations of the Continent, and a country for\r\n    which his ever lamented father did so much. I beg to thank you\r\n    for the honour you have done me in drinking my own health in\r\n    connection with the health of her Royal Highness the Princess of\r\n    Wales and the other members of the Royal Family.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 20th, 1868._\r\n\r\nAt the banquet of 1868, on the 20th of July, the Prince was formally\r\ninstalled as one of the \"Younger Brethren\" of the Trinity House, the\r\noaths having been administered by the Duke of Edinburgh, as Master. In\r\nproposing the usual loyal toasts, the Master said it gave him much\r\nsatisfaction to be supported by his brother, who, however, on this\r\noccasion was present as a member of the Corporation. The Prince, on\r\nspeaking to the toast, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highnesses, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I return my\r\n    best thanks to my illustrious relative for the kind way in\r\n    which he has proposed this toast, and for coupling with it the\r\n    health of the Princess of Wales and that of the other members of\r\n    the Royal Family. I am very grateful for the reception which has\r\n    been accorded him in this room, and I have great pleasure in\r\n    being here this evening. This is not the first time I have been\r\n    present at the hospitable board of the Trinity House. It is the\r\n    second time I have supported my brother, and I come here now in\r\n    a double capacity, for I have the honour of being present to-day\r\n    as a member of this Corporation and as his 'younger brother.' I\r\n    am sure I may say even in his presence that it is a source of\r\n    the greatest satisfaction to me to be present at the first\r\n    dinner at which he has presided since his return from Australia.\r\n    I know I am only speaking his wishes when I say that, although\r\n    the season is now far advanced, he thought, consistently with\r\n    the duties he had to perform on board the _Galatea_, now off\r\n    Osborne, he could not refrain from taking the chair at the\r\n    anniversary dinner of this ancient Corporation, of which he has\r\n    the honour of being the Master. I thank you for the kind way in\r\n    which this toast has been received.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Richmond, as President of the Board of Trade, acknowledged\r\nthe great services to the Mercantile Marine rendered by the Trinity\r\nHouse. Lord Napier of Magdala, in response to the toast of \"The\r\nVisitors,\" spoke of the efficient manner in which the Transport Service\r\nhad been carried out during the Abyssinian Expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 4th, 1869._\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the Duke of Edinburgh was absent, and the Prince of\r\nWales undertook the office of presiding at the dinner on the 4th of\r\nJuly. Sir Frederick Arrow, Deputy Master, and the Elder\r\nBrethren, among whom were Mr. Disraeli and Mr. Gladstone,\r\nhonorary Brethren, received the invited guests, among whom were\r\nPrince Arthur, Prince Christian, Prince Teck, Prince Edward of\r\nSaxe Weimar, and numerous men of high distinction in public life.\r\n\r\nThe Prince having proposed \"The Health of The Queen, the\r\nprotectress of this ancient Corporation,\" Sir Frederick Arrow gave\r\n\"The Health of the Prince and Princess of Wales and the rest of\r\nthe Royal Family.\" The Deputy Master referred to the sympathy\r\nof the Prince with naval service in all departments, and especially\r\nhis love of yachting. He also referred to his tour in the East,\r\nsince they last assembled at their annual festival. The Prince\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highnesses, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I am gratified\r\n    by the honour you have done me in drinking my health and that of\r\n    the Princess of Wales and the other members of the Royal Family.\r\n    I can assure you it has given me great pleasure to be present on\r\n    this occasion, but I feel I have hardly any right to occupy this\r\n    chair. The last time I was here I was elected a younger member\r\n    of your Corporation. To-day I have become an elder member, and\r\n    Sir Frederick Arrow asked me to take the chair in place of my\r\n    brother, the Master, who is now in a far distant land. You may\r\n    be sure that I shall always be ready to assist in every way I\r\n    can to promote the good of this excellent institution. Sir\r\n    Frederick Arrow has been pleased to allude to my yachting. It is\r\n    true I am fond of yachting, but I cannot claim to be either a\r\n    nautical or a naval man. You may, however, always reckon upon\r\n    any services I can render in any way in which you may think I\r\n    can be useful to your Corporation.\"\r\n\r\nOther customary toasts were then given, and responded to. To the toast\r\nof \"The Master of the Corporation,\" his Royal Highness the Duke of\r\nEdinburgh, \"wishing him a happy, prosperous, and safe voyage from the\r\nSouthern hemisphere, and a quick return home,\" the Prince of Wales\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highnesses, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I feel I am in\r\n    rather a difficult position in having to return thanks for one\r\n    who is absent. At the same time, I feel assured my brother would\r\n    be gratified by my thanking you for the manner in which his\r\n    health has been proposed and welcomed. According to the French\r\n    proverb, '_Les absens ont toujours tort_.' But I hope you will\r\n    think differently, seeing that my brother is a post captain in\r\n    Her Majesty's Navy, and is visiting one of Her Majesty's far\r\n    distant colonies. I am sure if he knew you were drinking his\r\n    health at this time his heart would be with you. Before I sit\r\n    down I have the honour of proposing to you a toast--the\r\n    principal toast of the evening. I call upon you to drink,\r\n    'Prosperity to the Corporation of Trinity House.' It would be\r\n    almost superfluous in me to make any remarks on the Corporation\r\n    or its present or future development. It has existed since the\r\n    time of Henry VIII., and ever since that time to the present the\r\n    community has taken the deepest interest in its prosperity. It\r\n    has also been connected through its honorary Brethren with some\r\n    of the most distinguished men, and many of those honorary\r\n    Brethren are present here this evening. Its object is to protect\r\n    our ships and our sailors, and that object is never forgotten.\r\n    As the First Lord of the Admiralty has just said, while the Navy\r\n    is called upon to protect our commerce, the Corporation of\r\n    Trinity House is called upon to protect our sailors and our\r\n    ships. The first electric light put up in this country was that\r\n    at Dungeness, and the great Wolf Rock, which has long been the\r\n    terror of our sailors, will before long cease to be so. This\r\n    will show you that the Trinity House authorities are anxious to\r\n    do their duty and to maintain their great name, which I am sure\r\n    is honoured here and in other countries. Before I resume my seat\r\n    I give you 'The Health of Sir Frederick Arrow, the Deputy\r\n    Master,' and I am sure you will drink it with enthusiasm,\r\n    knowing as you do how justly he merits your applause. He has\r\n    done his duty in every way to maintain the interests of the\r\n    Corporation, and I think the honour was eminently due which his\r\n    Sovereign conferred in making him Sir Frederick Arrow. I call\r\n    upon you to drink 'Prosperity to the ancient Corporation of\r\n    Trinity House,' coupling with the toast the name of Sir\r\n    Frederick Arrow.\"\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Arrow, having briefly responded, gave the toast of \"Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers,\" saying that, although politics are unknown at the\r\nTrinity House, it was their duty to mark their respect for the\r\nGovernment of the day. Mr. Gladstone responded. The toast of \"The\r\nMaritime and Commercial Interests of the Country,\" was coupled with the\r\nname of Mr. Bright, as President of the Board of Trade. Mr. Bright made\r\nan eloquent reply, discoursing on the benefits to this nation, and to\r\nall nations, of the works of the Trinity House Corporation. He said that\r\nhe believed that \"at this time the merchant ships of England are equal,\r\nor nearly equal--I have heard it said they surpass--in number and\r\ntonnage the seagoing merchant ships of all other countries in the world.\r\nThis is an extraordinary thing, if it be true. But, whether it be\r\nexactly true or not, there can be no doubt with regard to foreign\r\ncommerce--with regard to ships on the ocean--this country has a position\r\nat this moment which I believe it never held before, and one I think we\r\nmay fairly be proud of. I delight, therefore, to dilate on the grandeur\r\nof our merchant navy, and I agree with Mr. Cardwell in hoping that the\r\ntime is coming when the resources of this country may not be expended to\r\nan extravagant extent in maintaining our military establishments.\"\r\n\r\nIn dilating on the magnitude of British commerce and the number of\r\nBritish merchant ships, it probably never occurred to Mr. Bright that in\r\ncase of war, a few swift armed cruisers would make these ships fly, like\r\ndoves before hawks, and the seas be cleared of our now countless\r\nmerchant steamers. The _Alabama_ and a few swift rovers speedily swept\r\nall the commerce of the United States from the sea; and the same would\r\nbe the fate of the vaster commerce of Great Britain, if there are not\r\narmed vessels, swift, powerful, and numerous, to protect our mercantile\r\nnavy in every region of the globe. There is no political question in\r\nthis, but the common prudential principle of insurance against possible\r\nperil and disaster. Our coasts may be adequately defended, but there is\r\nneed of a naval volunteer service as well as of volunteer riflemen and\r\ngunners on land. It may be one of the future national services rendered\r\nby the Prince of Wales to get the yachting men of the day to form\r\nthemselves into naval volunteers, in case of the protection of swift\r\narmed cruisers being needed for protecting the fleets of merchantmen on\r\nwhich the people of England depend for supplies.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Bright's speech, the toast of \"The Honorary Brethren\" was\r\nresponded to by Mr. Disraeli, who was followed by Sir Stafford\r\nNorthcote, Sir R. Phillimore, and Sir John Burgoyne. Seldom has the\r\nbanqueting hall of the Trinity House been honoured by the presence of so\r\nmany illustrious and eloquent guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 24th, 1871._\r\n\r\nIn 1871, the Duke of Edinburgh, Master of the Trinity House, had\r\nreturned to England, and on the 24th of June took his place as President\r\nat the annual banquet. The Prince of Wales was present, and a\r\ndistinguished company.\r\n\r\nIn proposing the health of the Prince of Wales, the Master thanked him\r\nfor having performed the duties of the Mastership during his absence.\r\nThree years before he had jocularly called the Prince his younger\r\nBrother. He had since become an Elder Brother, but, in respect of the\r\nTrinity House, he, as Master, was still the eldest brother. The Prince,\r\nin reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is a great pleasure to me to have my health proposed by my\r\n    brother in the kind manner in which he has proposed it. He has\r\n    been pleased to allude to what I call the small duties which I\r\n    have had to perform at the Trinity House in his absence. I think\r\n    all the Brethren are well aware that it gave me great\r\n    satisfaction to be able to do anything during my brother's\r\n    absence; and I only regret that I had not more to do; but the\r\n    real duties were, in fact, performed by a gentleman who now sits\r\n    on my right (the Deputy Master), and I have to thank him and\r\n    all the Brethren for the assistance they rendered during the\r\n    interregnum. My brother is now on half-pay, but the time may\r\n    come when he will again have an important command. In that event\r\n    I shall be glad again to be of any service during his absence,\r\n    and the Trinity House may always count upon my placing myself at\r\n    their disposal.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual toasts were given, and responded to. His Royal Highness the\r\nPrince of Wales gave Her Majesty's Ministers, saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"To whatever party they belonged, so long as they performed\r\n    their duty to the Crown and upheld the dignity and honour of the\r\n    country, they were entitled to the compliment he now asked the\r\n    company to pay to them, and he had great pleasure in coupling\r\n    the toast with the name of his noble and learned friend the Lord\r\n    Chancellor.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor responded, saying that there was not among the\r\nmethods of preserving peace any greater or more effective means than\r\nthat of maintaining in its full force and activity the great Navy of\r\nEngland, which must be looked upon by every Government with unmixed\r\nadmiration; and he trusted, whatever differences might exist on other\r\nsubjects, Her Majesty's Government would show that they had one common\r\nobject, the maintenance of the maritime reputation, honour, and dignity\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Milner Gibson, by command of the Master, proposed a toast always\r\ngiven at the Trinity House anniversaries: \"The maritime and commercial\r\ninterests of the country, and the President of the Board of Trade.\"\r\nHaving himself long held the office of President of the Board of Trade,\r\nMr. Milner Gibson bore testimony to the efficient administration by the\r\nTrinity House of the funds placed at their disposal. As the funds came\r\nfrom a tax on the shipping and trade of the country, it is a right and\r\nconstitutional thing that the expenditure should be controlled by the\r\nMinister of Commerce, responsible to Parliament. He could say that the\r\nlights on the coast of the United Kingdom were equal, if not superior,\r\nto the lights which existed in any other country in the world. Under the\r\ncontrol of the Board of Trade we had made great improvement in the\r\nsystem of lighting our coasts, coupled with a reduced charge upon the\r\ntrade of the country.\r\n\r\nIt might have been added that it was when the Prince Consort was Master\r\nthat more constitutional relations between the Trinity House and the\r\nGovernment came into operation, the funds being supplied by the Board of\r\nTrade, and administered by the Corporation, who then had what they\r\ncalled \"new Sailing Orders\" for their guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 27th, 1874._\r\n\r\nThe banquet at the Corporation Hall on June 27, 1874, was presided over\r\nby His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in the absence of the Master,\r\nthe Duke of Edinburgh. The Deputy Master Sir Frederick Arrow, after the\r\nusual loyal and patriotic toasts, gave \"The Health of the Prince of\r\nWales,\" who responded in brief and appropriate terms, and afterwards\r\nproposed the toast of \"Prosperity to the Corporation of the Trinity\r\nHouse.\" He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your Royal Highnesses, my Lords, and Gentlemen,--I have now the\r\n    honour of proposing to you a toast which I only wish had been\r\n    placed in better hands than mine. Although I have the honour of\r\n    being connected with this ancient Guild, I do not feel that I\r\n    possess that nautical knowledge which a person ought to have who\r\n    proposes a toast like 'Prosperity to the Corporation of Trinity\r\n    House'; but I am sure it is a toast which will meet with your\r\n    approval this evening. I will begin by stating that the few\r\n    remarks with which I shall preface the toast are not of my own\r\n    knowledge, the facts having been supplied to me by the kindness\r\n    of the Deputy Master, and if I get out of my depth or among the\r\n    quicksands I must trust you will excuse me. I speak with\r\n    sincerity when I say that since we met here last year the duties\r\n    of the Trinity House have been carried on as successfully as on\r\n    any previous occasion, and that the whole of its proceedings\r\n    have been of a highly satisfactory character. There have been\r\n    several new lighthouses built--one, I believe, has been\r\n    completed to-day, and is to be opened on the 1st of July. It is\r\n    on Hartland Point, and, with reference to our commercial\r\n    interests, is considered to be of great importance. It will do\r\n    much to facilitate our trade with the Welsh coal ports. The\r\n    Goodwin Sands is a name which fills every sailor with alarm;\r\n    and, although everything has been done to prevent the fearful\r\n    wrecks with which the name is associated, we have only to read\r\n    the daily newspapers to be aware of the fearful disasters that\r\n    often occur at sea outside those terrible sands. The Trinity\r\n    House has lately put a second lighthouse eastward of Beachy\r\n    Head.\r\n\r\n    \"There is another subject in connection with which the Trinity\r\n    House has taken a very active part, and it is one of great\r\n    importance, especially to nautical men. I mean the subject of\r\n    sound-signals in foggy weather. The Trinity House has every\r\n    reason to feel deeply indebted to Professor Tyndall, who, I\r\n    regret to say, could not be with us upon this occasion owing to\r\n    his absence from England. Some most interesting experiments in\r\n    connection with sound-signals have been carried out by him, and\r\n    a most able report has been written by him on the subject. I am\r\n    sure you will all agree with me in thinking this a most\r\n    important matter, and one in which it is natural that the\r\n    Trinity House should take a prominent interest. At a great many\r\n    stations it has been determined to place these fog-signals where\r\n    lights can be of no avail.\r\n\r\n    \"There is another matter in connection with which the Trinity\r\n    House has every reason for congratulation. I mean the reduction\r\n    of dues to the amount of £80,000, in addition to the reduction\r\n    of £60,000 in 1872. There are many other important facts\r\n    connected with the Trinity House which the Deputy Master has\r\n    been kind enough to place at my disposal, but which I need not\r\n    now detain you by mentioning. In proposing the toast of\r\n    'Prosperity to the Corporation of the Trinity House,' it is my\r\n    pleasing duty to connect it with the health of one who not only\r\n    does everything to make our annual gatherings here most\r\n    agreeable, but who performs the arduous and responsible duties\r\n    which he has to discharge in a most praiseworthy and effective\r\n    manner. I am sure that you will drink most cordially the health\r\n    of the Deputy Master. My Lords and gentlemen, I give you\r\n    'Prosperity to the Corporation of the Trinity House, coupled\r\n    with the name of Sir Frederick Arrow, the Deputy Master.'\"\r\n\r\nAt a later period of the evening His Royal Highness proposed the toasts\r\nof \"Her Majesty's Ministers,\" to which the Lord Chancellor responded,\r\nand the \"Distinguished Visitors,\" coupling with it the name of the Lord\r\nChief Justice of England (Sir Alexander Cockburn).\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 2nd, 1875._\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the Duke of Edinburgh was not abroad, and presided at the annual\r\ndinner on the 2nd of June. The seamen of the _Galatea_ lined the way to\r\nthe Hall, on Tower Hill, in honour of the occasion, and of the presence\r\nof their captain. In the room where the guests were received was a\r\nportrait of the Master, painted as a companion picture to those already\r\non the walls, by a Russian artist, G. Koberwein. Count Shouvaloff, the\r\nRussian Ambassador, was among the guests. In responding to the customary\r\ntoast of \"The Royal Family,\" the Prince of Wales expressed his\r\ngratification at his brother Prince Leopold having become a member of\r\nthe Corporation. The Duke of Cambridge responded for the Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1877._\r\n\r\nThe banquet of 1877 was again presided over by the Prince of Wales, in\r\nthe absence of the Master, the Duke of Edinburgh. There was the usual\r\nselect company, including Royal and other distinguished guests,\r\nespecially General Grant, who, in his travels throughout the old world,\r\nwas received with as great honour as any king could be.\r\n\r\nIn proposing the health of the Prince of Wales, the Earl of Derby\r\nsaid:--\"No one particularly likes to listen to his own panegyric, even\r\nat a public dinner, and therefore I will say nothing with regard to the\r\nillustrious subject of my toast beyond that which you all know to be the\r\nsimple and literal truth. His Royal Highness has not only now, but for\r\nmany years past, done all that is in the power of man to do, by genial\r\ncourtesies towards men of every class, and by his indefatigable\r\nassiduity in the performance of every social duty, to secure at once\r\nthat public respect which is due to his exalted position and that social\r\nsympathy and personal popularity which no position, however exalted, can\r\nof itself be sufficient to secure. We regret the absence of the\r\nillustrious Master of the Corporation, the Duke of Edinburgh, but we\r\nregret it the less because he is doing what each of us in our humble\r\nspheres desires and endeavours to do--he is serving his country. I give\r\nyou \"The Health of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and the rest\r\nof the Royal Family.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with all the accustomed honours, and the Prince in\r\nreply said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--I return you my sincere thanks for the\r\n    kind way in which the toast of my health has been proposed and\r\n    the manner in which it has been received. I can assure the whole\r\n    company that I feel it a great honour to be present on this\r\n    occasion, especially connected as I have the honour to be with\r\n    your Master. I regret that my brother is not here this evening.\r\n    It is now two years since I was present at this annual\r\n    gathering, and I regret to say I miss the kind and genial face\r\n    of the late Deputy Master, Sir Frederick Arrow; but in Admiral\r\n    Collinson we have an excellent substitute. On the present\r\n    occasion it is a matter of peculiar gratification to us as\r\n    Englishmen to receive as our guest General Grant. I can assure\r\n    him, for myself and for all the loyal subjects of the Queen,\r\n    that it has given us the greatest pleasure to see him as a guest\r\n    in this country. My lords and gentlemen, before resuming my\r\n    seat, it is my privilege to propose to you another toast--one\r\n    which always recommends itself most heartily to the public, and\r\n    that is 'The Army, Navy, and Reserve Forces,' connecting with it\r\n    on this occasion the name of a distinguished officer, Lord\r\n    Strathnairn, and that of the Hon. Sir Henry Keppel.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was received with three times three. Lord Strathnairn and Sir\r\nH. Keppel replied to the compliment, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nresponded to the toast of \"Her Majesty's Ministers,\" proposed by His\r\nRoyal Highness the Chairman. Other toasts having been given and\r\nacknowledged, the Earl of Carnarvon proposed \"The Health of the Guests,\"\r\ncoupled with the name of General Grant; saying that \"there never has\r\nbeen one to whom we willingly accord a freer, a fuller, a heartier\r\nwelcome than we do to General Grant on this occasion. We accord it to\r\nhim, not merely because we believe he has performed the part of a\r\ndistinguished General in many a 'well-foughten field,' nor because he\r\nhas twice filled the highest office which the citizens of his great\r\ncountry can fill, but because we look upon him here present to-night as\r\nrepresenting, so to speak, that good-will and that affection which ought\r\nto subsist between us and the United States of America. It is not a\r\ncentury since there befell this country what we believe to have been the\r\ngreatest misfortune that her pages record. Not a hundred years ago the\r\nStates of America separated from us; and, great as the loss was, I do\r\nnot think that the separation was the greatest part of the calamity. The\r\ndisaster lay in this, that the separation on each side was effected amid\r\nthe storms of passion, resentment, and animosity. Yet not a century has\r\nrolled by, and I believe, and thank God for believing, that in a great\r\nmeasure that animosity and resentment have passed away, and we are\r\nentering on a new stage of mutual trust, of mutual sympathy, and of\r\nmutual support and strength. I have had, perhaps, special opportunities\r\nof observing this in the office I have the honour to hold. It has been\r\nmy duty to be connected with the great dominion of Canada, stretching,\r\nas it does, several thousand miles along the frontier of the United\r\nStates, and during the last three or four years I can truthfully say\r\nthat nothing impressed me more or gave me livelier satisfaction than the\r\ninterchange of friendly and good offices between the two countries under\r\nthe auspices of President Grant.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was loudly cheered on rising to respond. He spoke in such\r\na low voice as not to be heard distinctly, but he was understood to say\r\nthat he felt more impressed than possibly he had ever felt before on any\r\noccasion. He came there under the impression that this was the Trinity\r\nHouse, and that the trinity consisted of the Army, the Navy, and Peace.\r\nHe therefore thought it was a place of quietude, where there would be no\r\ntalk or toasts. He had been therefore naturally surprised at hearing\r\nboth one and the other. He had heard some remarks from His Royal\r\nHighness the President of the evening which compelled him to say one\r\nword in response to them. The remarks he referred to were complimentary\r\nto him. He begged to thank His Royal Highness for those remarks. There\r\nhad been other things said during the evening highly gratifying to him.\r\nNot the least gratifying among them was to hear that there were\r\noccasionally in this country party fights as well as in America. He had\r\nseen before now as much as a war between the three departments of the\r\nState--the executive, the judicial, and the legislative departments. He\r\nhad not seen the political parties of England go so far as that since he\r\nhad come to this country. He would imitate their Chairman, who had set\r\nthe good example of oratory--that was brevity--and say no more than\r\nsimply to thank His Royal Highness and the company for the visitors.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the longest speeches ever made by General Grant, whose\r\nallusion to party fights was suggested by what had been said by the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer: \"There have been reports and rumours of\r\ndissensions in the Cabinet, and of them I do not mean to say anything\r\nbut this--there is one subject on which there is no dissension. Among\r\nall the ministers who have ever dined at the Trinity House there is no\r\ndissension as to the manner in which they have been received in this\r\nhospitable hall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC.\r\n\r\n[Blank Page]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal College of Music has occupied so much of the time and labour\r\nof the Prince of Wales, and promises to be an institution of so great\r\nnational importance, that it seems well to present in order the various\r\nmovements that led up to the foundation of the College, and to group\r\ntogether the successive speeches of the Prince on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR MUSIC.\r\n\r\n_June 15th, 1875._\r\n\r\nThe need for extending musical education, and for improving musical\r\ntaste in England, has long been felt. That there is no lack of musical\r\ngenius or skill in our country is sufficiently attested by the great\r\narray of eminent composers and distinguished performers, whether in\r\nvocal or instrumental music, both in former and in recent times. Nor has\r\nthe love of the art, and delight in its exercise, ever been wanting.\r\nThere was a time when what we now call \"old English\" rounds and catches,\r\nglees and madrigals, and all kinds of choral compositions, were popular,\r\nin the widest sense of the word. The love of orchestral harmony has also\r\nbeen great in England, where Handel found his home, and the best field\r\nfor his wonderful powers. In those days Ireland was truly one with\r\nEngland, in appreciation of high classical music. It was in Dublin that\r\nthe _Messiah_ was first heard, and best appreciated. Even in the\r\ndepressed period of music, in the early decades of this century, there\r\nwere always competitions of well-trained choirs and bands, which showed\r\nthe love and practice of musical art to be still widely diffused and\r\nardently cultivated.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, it had come to be necessary to take some\r\nmeasures for advancing musical art throughout the country, where great\r\ntowns and busy centres of industry had multiplied, without the\r\ncivilising influence of music being to a corresponding degree diffused.\r\nNo one felt this more strongly than the Prince Consort, but the\r\nopportunity of carrying out his ideas did not arise in his lifetime. The\r\nRoyal Academy of Music, founded in 1822, and incorporated in 1830, did\r\ngood service in its limited way, for training its pupils and awarding a\r\nfew scholarships; but some institution was needed, with larger\r\nexpansiveness, and capable of diffusing the love and the practice of\r\nmusic more widely among the people.\r\n\r\nIt was in furtherance of this national purpose that the Prince of Wales,\r\nwho put himself at the head of the movement, held a conference at\r\nMarlborough House, on the 15th of June, 1875.\r\n\r\nThe immediate object was to promote the establishment of free\r\nscholarships, to be held in the National Training Schools for Music,\r\nthen being erected, close to the Royal Albert Hall, at Kensington Gore.\r\nThe Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Christian and the Duke of Teck were\r\npresent; and representatives of many public bodies in Church and State,\r\nincluding the Archbishops and several Bishops, the Lord Mayor of London\r\nand the Mayors of many provincial towns, the Masters or Prime Wardens of\r\nthe City Companies, the head masters of public schools, the Chairman and\r\nmembers of the London School Board, the Parliamentary representatives of\r\nthe Metropolitan boroughs, and a very numerous company, of the most\r\ndistinguished name and position.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, in opening the proceedings, expressed his\r\ngratification at the large attendance, which augured well for the object\r\nthey all had in view. He then called on the Duke of Edinburgh to move\r\nthe first resolution, in introducing which he gave a lucid and\r\ninteresting statement of the history of the movement.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, the Royal Academy of Music made an application to the\r\nCommissioners of the Exhibition of 1851 to grant a site upon their\r\nestate for a building in which they could carry on their labours. The\r\nnegotiations were not successful, and matters remained in abeyance until\r\n1865, when the Society of Arts appointed a Committee to consider and\r\nreport on the whole subject of musical education in this country. Of\r\nthis committee the Prince of Wales consented to act as chairman.\r\nInquiries were made as to the methods employed in the management of\r\nmusical academies in Paris, Berlin, Munich, Milan, and other Continental\r\nschools. Reports were drawn up, one of the main points in which dealt\r\nwith the necessity for instituting scholarships to be competed for\r\nopenly, so as to draw out the best musical talent throughout the\r\ncountry. Assistance should be given in cases where the scholars were\r\nunable to provide education for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 negotiations were reopened with the Royal Academy, with the idea\r\nof removing the head-quarters of the Academy from Tenderden Street to\r\nSouth Kensington. It became more evident that the purposes contemplated\r\nby the Committee of the Society of Arts could be better accomplished by\r\nthe establishment of a new and independent institution as a National\r\nTraining School for Music. The foundation-stone of the new institution\r\nhad been laid in 1873, at which time a member of the Council, Mr.\r\nFreake, had liberally offered to undertake the whole cost of the\r\nbuilding. At first Mr. Freake intended to give the use only of the\r\nbuilding for some years, but he now requested the acceptance of it as a\r\nfree gift. It was further stated by the Duke of Edinburgh that there was\r\nample accommodation for above 300 students. It only remained to obtain\r\nthe foundation of Scholarships in sufficient numbers for the appointment\r\nof a permanent Staff of Professors, and other arrangements for\r\nefficiently carrying on the new training school.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Edinburgh then moved a resolution for the appointment of a\r\nCommittee for taking steps to found Free Scholarships for the City of\r\nLondon and the Metropolitan districts. This resolution was seconded by\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury, and supported by the Lord Mayor and the\r\nArchbishop of York.\r\n\r\n    The Prince of Wales, in responding to a vote of thanks for\r\n    having convened and presiding over the meeting, said, \"he\r\n    thought the initiative in this matter was really due to his\r\n    brother, the Duke of Edinburgh, who had taken great interest in\r\n    music since his childhood. The same was the case with their\r\n    father, the late Prince Consort, whose name would always be\r\n    remembered with gratitude for the powerful influence he had\r\n    exercised on the intellectual advancement of the country, and to\r\n    whose efforts might be traced in great measure the important\r\n    place which music now held in the estimation of all classes.\r\n\r\n    \"On the whole, they had reason to congratulate themselves on the\r\n    success of the meeting, and he was glad to have the opportunity\r\n    of returning his thanks to the Lord Mayor and to all the\r\n    gentlemen representing the great City Companies for their\r\n    co-operation on this occasion, feeling that that meeting would\r\n    be the commencement of a movement which he trusted would be a\r\n    success. In conclusion, he wished to move a resolution conveying\r\n    a vote of thanks to Mr. Freake for the handsome and liberal\r\n    manner in which he had so kindly behaved in giving the building\r\n    for the National Training School of Music. It was already a\r\n    great exercise of liberality to offer the use of it rent free\r\n    for five years, and certainly he was sure none present could\r\n    have expected that he would have made them a present of it. He\r\n    was therefore anxious that they should on that occasion record a\r\n    unanimous vote of thanks to him for his great liberality, and\r\n    for the interest he had taken in the welfare of that which they\r\n    had so much at heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Edinburgh seconded the resolution, which was carried\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDING THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC.\r\n\r\n_February 28th, 1882._\r\n\r\nAs far back as June, 1875, the Prince of Wales, we have seen, had taken\r\nsteps to secure improvement of musical education throughout the kingdom.\r\nWith this purpose he had invited many influential persons to a\r\nConference at Marlborough House, which was held on the 15th of June of\r\nthat year, and which resulted in the establishment of the National\r\nTraining School of Music, with Sir Arthur Sullivan as its Principal. Ten\r\nyears earlier, in 1865, the Prince had induced the Society of Arts to\r\nappoint a Committee to consider and report on the whole subject of\r\nmusical education in this country, and of this Committee he gladly\r\nconsented to act as President.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the Prince summoned a number of gentlemen to a meeting at\r\nMarlborough House, where the proposal to found a National College of\r\nMusic, uniting the Academy and the Training School, was first mooted. A\r\ncommittee was appointed, and the assent both of the Academy and the\r\nSchool had been obtained, when the Academy withdrew, and declined to\r\naccept the proposals of union. It was not till after the lapse of\r\nseveral years that the way was clear for the establishment of a new and\r\ntruly national institution.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of February, 1882, the Prince of Wales presided at a meeting\r\nheld in the Banqueting Hall, St. James's Palace, for the purpose of\r\nsoliciting public support for founding a \"Royal College of Music.\" This\r\nmeeting is destined to be a memorable event, not only in musical annals,\r\nbut in the history of the nation. What was the character and influence\r\nof that meeting was stated in eloquent terms by Sir George Grove, in his\r\nspeech at the inauguration of the Royal College in the following year.\r\nThis statement will be given in full on a subsequent page, the following\r\nwords being sufficient to quote here: \"A meeting so truly national in\r\nits aspect gave, if I may use a not inappropriate figure, the key-note\r\nof the movement; and the key-note thus struck at St. James's Palace\r\nresounded through the country, and met with a ready and harmonious\r\nresponse.\"\r\n\r\nLarger meetings the Prince has frequently addressed, but never one more\r\nbroadly representative of all the most distinguished and influential\r\nclasses in the kingdom. The Ambassadors and Ministers of most of the\r\nContinental Powers were also among the audience.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, who on rising was most cordially greeted, opened\r\nthe proceedings by reading letters from the Duke of Connaught and Prince\r\nChristian, expressing regret that circumstances prevented them from\r\nbeing present, and their hearty sympathy with the objects of the\r\nmeeting. Prince Christian in his letter briefly recounted the history\r\nof the fruitless attempt which had been made to induce Professor\r\nMacfarren and the directors of the Royal Academy of Music to consent to\r\na union of their institution with the National Training School of Music,\r\nwith a view to form a Royal College of Music on a more extended basis.\r\nThe Prince of Wales then said:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen,--I have called you together to-day, the\r\n    representatives of the counties and towns in England, the\r\n    dignitaries of the Church and other religious and educational\r\n    bodies, distinguished colonists now resident in England, and the\r\n    representatives of foreign Powers, to aid me in the promotion of\r\n    a national object by obtaining contributions for the\r\n    establishment of a Royal College of Music. Were the object less\r\n    than of national importance, I should not have troubled you--the\r\n    heads of social life--to meet me here to-day, and I should not\r\n    myself have undertaken the responsibility of acting as the\r\n    leader and organiser of the movement. I have invited to meet you\r\n    the leading musicians and publishers of music, the most eminent\r\n    musical instrument makers, the most influential amateurs and\r\n    patrons of music, and I trust that by the co-operation and union\r\n    of some of the most powerful elements of society, we may succeed\r\n    in establishing a Royal College of Music on a more extended\r\n    basis than any existing institution in the United Kingdom;\r\n    worthy alike of this meeting and of this country, for whose\r\n    benefit you are asked to give your time, your money, and your\r\n    influence.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not propose to trouble you with any proofs of the\r\n    advantages that would be derived from the establishment of a\r\n    National College of Music. That subject has been fully discussed\r\n    by the Duke of Albany at Manchester, and his address is before\r\n    the world. He showed that relatively to foreign countries\r\n    England occupied three centuries ago a higher place in the\r\n    musical world than she does at the present time, and he proved\r\n    that the almost universal establishment of central and national\r\n    musical institutions abroad, and the want of such an institution\r\n    in England, had been one cause why musical progress has not in\r\n    this country kept pace with the increase of wealth and\r\n    population and the corresponding development of science and art.\r\n\r\n    \"Again, the necessity of public aid formed the groundwork of\r\n    the appeal made at Manchester by the Duke of Edinburgh and\r\n    Prince Christian. Music, as they showed, is far more expensive\r\n    to teach than other arts, and the natural capacity for\r\n    instruction in music is more rare than in almost any other art.\r\n    You are compelled, then, if you would have good musicians, to\r\n    provide means by which those to whom nature has been bountiful\r\n    in giving good ears and good voices, but niggardly in giving\r\n    worldly wealth, may be sought out in their obscurity and brought\r\n    up to distinction by a proper course of instruction.\r\n\r\n    \"What I have said naturally leads me to deal with free education\r\n    in music, coupled in certain cases with free maintenance of the\r\n    pupil as the first branch of the subject on which I desire to\r\n    engage your sympathies and ask your aid. This system of\r\n    gratuitous education is one of the principal features which will\r\n    distinguish the new college from the Royal Academy and other\r\n    excellent existing schools of music. I do not mean to say that\r\n    we intend to exclude paying pupils. To adopt such a course would\r\n    be to deprive musical ability in the upper classes of any means\r\n    of access to the college, and would stamp it with a narrow and\r\n    contracted character, which is above all to be avoided in a\r\n    national institution intended to include in its corporate\r\n    character all classes throughout the United Kingdom. What I seek\r\n    to create is an institution bearing the same relation to the art\r\n    of music as that which our great public schools--Eton and\r\n    Winchester, for example--bear to general education. On the one\r\n    side you have scholars who are on the foundation and educated by\r\n    means of endowments; on the other side, pupils who derive no\r\n    direct benefit from the foundation. Both classes of pupils\r\n    follow the same course of study; their teachers are the same,\r\n    their rewards are the same. They differ only in the fact that\r\n    the collegers derive aid from the college, while those who are\r\n    not on the foundation pay for the whole of their education. I\r\n    lay great stress on this combination of the two systems of\r\n    education--that by endowment and that by payment. Financially,\r\n    it enables us to have salaried teachers of the greatest\r\n    eminence, who will give so much of their time as they devote to\r\n    teaching exclusively to the instruction of pupils at the\r\n    college. But, more than all, a union of different classes in a\r\n    common and elevating pursuit is the best mode of binding in one\r\n    tie of common enthusiasm the different grades of society,\r\n    varying alike in wealth and social influence. Each has much to\r\n    learn from the other, and this learning is best acquired in an\r\n    institution where all meet on common ground, and on a footing of\r\n    artistic equality. A further object, and one most material, is\r\n    sought to be attained by including in our college persons who do\r\n    not intend to make music their profession. To advance music as\r\n    an art in its highest aspects, resort must be had to those who\r\n    possess the best opportunities for general mental culture. The\r\n    most highly educated classes are those who have the greatest\r\n    power of disseminating the influence of art throughout the\r\n    country. They are the sources from which the civilising stream\r\n    proceeds downwards, and penetrates through every channel of our\r\n    complex social life.\r\n\r\n    \"I will now proceed to explain the details of the scheme for\r\n    which I ask your support, beginning with the foundation, as\r\n    being that branch of the college for which public money will be\r\n    required. The least number of scholars which would be worthy to\r\n    constitute a foundation for the college would be 100. Of these,\r\n    50 should have their education free and 50 should be maintained\r\n    as well as educated. These scholars will be selected by open\r\n    competition throughout the United Kingdom. A system of\r\n    examination will be organised by which every town--nay, every\r\n    village--in the kingdom may be afforded a chance of\r\n    participating in the public benefaction. Only let eminent\r\n    ability be found in the village choir, the pupil will be brought\r\n    to London and may, if he do but possess the requisite ability,\r\n    become a Beethoven or a Mendelssohn, and any school of music may\r\n    put forward its best pupil as a candidate for collegiate\r\n    honours. The expense of maintenance and education of pupils I\r\n    estimate at about £80 a year; that of education alone at about\r\n    £40 a year. I should hope also that your liberality will grant\r\n    me means to found at least two fellowships, in order that rising\r\n    musicians, who have acquired distinction at the college, may not\r\n    be tempted on commencing their professional career to sacrifice\r\n    the higher aspirations of their art to the necessity of\r\n    providing immediate means of subsistence.\r\n\r\n    \"Having settled the number of our foundationers, where are we to\r\n    place them? In London, I need not say, land is sold by the\r\n    yard, and not by the acre, and a square yard in a good locality\r\n    is often equal in value to a square acre in a remote district.\r\n    Yet, for the health of a young community, we must have open\r\n    space and pure air, and space is particularly necessary in a\r\n    music school, for, as the Duke of Edinburgh showed in his\r\n    address at Manchester, pupils in an ordinary school may be\r\n    grouped and classified, but musical pupils require space for the\r\n    performance either of vocal or instrumental music, and the\r\n    individual attention of their masters to an extent quite unknown\r\n    in the education of pupils in other branches of knowledge.\r\n    Again, the locality in which a school is placed must be easy of\r\n    access in order to accommodate the staff of teachers, for,\r\n    though I hope to have a resident staff to a greater extent than\r\n    has yet been tried in any other musical school, yet undoubtedly\r\n    extraneous teaching must form a considerable portion of our\r\n    instruction. Now, on the point of site, I am happy to say I can\r\n    give the meeting the most satisfactory assurances without making\r\n    any calls on their liberality. It is due to the foresight of my\r\n    father, the Prince Consort, that at a time when South Kensington\r\n    was comparatively remote from London, the large estate held by\r\n    the Exhibition Commissioners was purchased with a view to\r\n    furnish sites for future public buildings. In the few years that\r\n    have elapsed since that purchase a suburb has been converted\r\n    into a city. The estate lies between two stations of the\r\n    Metropolitan District Railway, and is skirted on the north by\r\n    one of the most frequented roads in the Metropolis. Here already\r\n    we have a nucleus for the college in the building constructed by\r\n    the great liberality of Mr. Freake, and I am enabled to state,\r\n    as Chairman of the Commission of 1851, that in proportion as the\r\n    public contributions enable us to construct our buildings, in\r\n    the same proportion will the Commissioners be prepared to grant\r\n    a sufficiency of site on which to erect them. The Commissioners\r\n    have also a considerable portion of the Albert Hall under their\r\n    control, and, by connecting that hall with the new college by a\r\n    tunnel or a bridge, practising rooms, sitting-rooms,\r\n    dining-rooms, and two small theatres will be immediately at the\r\n    disposal of the college. The Commissioners will also be prepared\r\n    to assist the college with an annual grant of money. To maintain\r\n    the college with 100 pupils on the foundation apart from the\r\n    expense of buildings an income of not less than from £10,000 to\r\n    £12,000 a year will be required. The plan will admit of any\r\n    degree of development in proportion as the munificence of the\r\n    public or the Government supplies the requisite funds. A charter\r\n    for incorporating the college has already been prepared and laid\r\n    before the Privy Council. I have myself undertaken to be\r\n    President. The governing body consist of a council, intrusted\r\n    with the function of making by-laws for the regulation of the\r\n    college, and of an executive committee charged with the details\r\n    of the administration. The names of the gentlemen who form the\r\n    council and the executive committee will be published, and will,\r\n    I am satisfied, command the confidence alike of the public and\r\n    of the musical world.\r\n\r\n    \"I have now laid my plan before you. I commend it to your\r\n    favourable consideration. A few words I would fain add to\r\n    prevent any misunderstanding of my intentions. I have not\r\n    brought you here to ask your aid for the support only of a\r\n    school calculated to advance music by giving the best\r\n    instruction continued over a course of years. This might be done\r\n    by strengthening existing schools. I have not brought you here\r\n    for the sole purpose of asking for assistance whereby to educate\r\n    young and deserving musicians. Such an institution is but a\r\n    branch of what I desire to found. My object is above and beyond\r\n    all this. I wish to establish an institution having a wider\r\n    basis and a more extended influence than any existing school or\r\n    college of music in this country. It will teach music of the\r\n    highest class; it will have a foundation for the education, and\r\n    in some cases for the free maintenance, of scholars who have\r\n    obtained by merit the right to such privileges. But it will do\r\n    more than this. It will be to England what the Berlin\r\n    Conservatoire is to Germany, what the Paris Conservatoire is to\r\n    France, or the Vienna Conservatoire to Austria--the recognised\r\n    centre and head of the musical world. Why is it that Germany,\r\n    France, Italy have national styles of music? Why is it that\r\n    England has no music recognised as national? It has able\r\n    composers, but nothing indicative of the national life or\r\n    national feeling. The reason is not far to seek. There is no\r\n    centre of music to which English musicians may resort with\r\n    confidence and thence derive instruction, counsel, and\r\n    inspiration. I hope by the breadth of my plan to interest all\r\n    present in its success. You who are musicians must desire to\r\n    improve your art, and such will be the object of the Royal\r\n    College. You who are only lovers of music must wish well to a\r\n    plan which provides for all classes of Her Majesty's subjects a\r\n    pleasure which you yourselves enjoy so keenly. To those who are\r\n    deaf to music, as practical men I would say thus much--to raise\r\n    the people, you must purify their emotions and cultivate their\r\n    imaginations. To satisfy the natural craving for excitement, you\r\n    must substitute an innocent and healthy mode of acting on the\r\n    passions for the fierce thirst for drink and eager pursuit of\r\n    other unworthy objects. Music acts directly on the emotions, and\r\n    it cannot be abused, for no excess in music is injurious.\r\n\r\n    \"In laying this great national question before you, I have\r\n    followed the example of my father, by offering to place myself\r\n    at the head of a great social movement. I have asked you for\r\n    assistance, I await your answer with confidence. I am sure that\r\n    it will be worthy of the nation of which you are\r\n    representatives. To you, my Lords-Lieutenant, I would address\r\n    myself with an intimation that I trust you will assemble\r\n    meetings throughout your counties, for it is desirable that\r\n    contributions should be received from all parts of the country\r\n    as showing the interest taken by the people in music. My Lord\r\n    Mayor of London and other Mayors who are here,--I am sure I may\r\n    hope that you will assist me by presiding at assemblies of your\r\n    fellow-townsmen, and will urge them to contribute to so national\r\n    an institution. I may, I doubt not, look with confidence to the\r\n    representatives of the Church and of other religious and\r\n    educational denominations who have been good enough to attend\r\n    here, to remind their choirs and their flocks that any\r\n    contributions will be a grateful testimony that the population\r\n    of England are interested in improving an art which, more than\r\n    others, excites devotional feelings, and inspires with\r\n    enthusiasm public and private worship. From those who are\r\n    directly interested in music, either professionally or as\r\n    amateurs, I trust I have a right to expect the greatest measure\r\n    of assistance which they can afford; for on their behalf, and\r\n    with a view to extend the influence of the science to which they\r\n    are devoted, we are met here to-day for the purpose of\r\n    establishing a national central musical institution. I know the\r\n    loyalty of our Colonial brethren; they will not be behindhand in\r\n    aiding the mother country. From foreign countries I have ever\r\n    received so many tokens of regard and sympathy, that I may look\r\n    with confidence to them to give their support to an institution\r\n    the doors of which will be thrown open to all nations. One\r\n    practical observation in conclusion. I trust that those present\r\n    here to-day will each and every one of them from time to time\r\n    communicate to me the steps they are taking to procure\r\n    contributions, and will forward to the honorary secretaries the\r\n    amount of contributions they may receive. For my part, I will\r\n    take care, as soon as I am enabled to form some judgment of the\r\n    extent to which the nation will support this demand, to\r\n    communicate to the contributories and to the public the details\r\n    of the foundation and establishment of the College, of which I\r\n    have only set forth in my address the general outline.\"\r\n\r\nThe first resolution was proposed to the meeting by the Duke of\r\nEdinburgh, and seconded by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The speech of\r\nthe Duke of Edinburgh was so clear and practical, supplementing and\r\nconfirming that of the Prince of Wales, who has always generously\r\nattributed to his brother the initiation in this great national\r\nmovement, which, however, could not have been carried out without the\r\npersonal aid and influence of the Prince. He thus concluded:--\r\n\r\n\"I wish to express my own personal hope that the Royal College will not\r\nbe a mere teaching institution, but will become a centre for groups of\r\naffiliated colleges, the members of which will, with the Council of the\r\nRoyal College, form a musical senate, to which all questions of\r\nimportance relating to music and musicians may be referred for\r\ndetermination. This may perhaps be deemed somewhat Utopian, but I do not\r\ndespair of a time when the musical colleges throughout the country will\r\nally themselves with the Royal College, and form a body united by a\r\ncommon tie and a general system. I will go one step further, though I do\r\nnot conceal from myself that I am treading on somewhat delicate ground,\r\nand possibly trenching on the honoured privileges of the Universities;\r\nyet I will express my personal hope that, as London is the chief City of\r\nthe United Kingdom, so the Royal College should be the chief musical\r\ncollege, invested with the power of conferring musical degrees, and the\r\nsource from which all musical honours should legitimately flow.\r\n\r\n\"In proposing the first resolution, it only remains, my lords and\r\ngentlemen, for me to express my hope that the Prince of Wales will be\r\nsupported on the present occasion earnestly and faithfully. A large sum\r\nof money is required for our enterprise. England is rich, and ready at\r\nall times to forward a worthy national undertaking. Why should I say\r\nEngland only, when we are assured of the generous support of our\r\nColonial brethren, and when we trust that our American cousins will not\r\nbe behind in furthering the foundation of an establishment which may act\r\nas a home to their musical students on this side of the Atlantic? The\r\nrepresentatives of many foreign countries are here also. We look to them\r\nin many cases as examples in our new enterprise, and I feel sure that\r\ntheir kind advice and co-operation will not be wanting when we have\r\noccasion to seek them. I will now read the resolution intrusted to me:--\r\n\r\n\"'That this meeting approves of the proposal to establish a Royal\r\nCollege of Music as a national institution, and undertakes that meetings\r\nshall be called throughout the country, and the utmost exertions used,\r\nindividually and collectively, to forward the movement by obtaining the\r\nnecessary funds for founding and endowing a College of Music for the\r\nBritish Empire.'\"\r\n\r\nThe speeches of the Archbishop of Canterbury, of the Earl of Rosebery,\r\nthe Lord Mayor, and of Mr. Gladstone all touched upon points\r\nillustrating the importance of the movement, and the national benefits\r\nto be expected from it.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonder that no reference in this matter has been made to the\r\ngreat German reformer and patriot, Martin Luther, who was a strenuous\r\nadvocate of State education, including music. He placed music as next to\r\nreligion in the training of the young. He would have every schoolmaster\r\na lover of music, and capable of teaching it. This training of teachers\r\nis one of the most important functions of the College, and should be\r\nsteadily kept in mind.\r\n\r\nWhen the thanks of the meeting had been moved, by Sir Stafford\r\nNorthcote, to the Royal Chairman, and carried with acclamation,--\r\n\r\n    The Prince of Wales mentioned, in his reply, that \"he had\r\n    received a touching letter from some one who had anonymously\r\n    sent £50 for the Royal College of Music--one whose earliest\r\n    recollection was the singing of the National Anthem on the\r\n    Coronation of the Queen, when as a poor lad he joined in the\r\n    procession of Sunday-school children.\"\r\n\r\nMany munificent donations and subscriptions were announced, but none\r\nmore touching and interesting than this.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONIES AND THE COLLEGE OF MUSIC.\r\n\r\n_March 23rd, 1882._\r\n\r\nThe meeting at St. James's Palace on the 28th of February, 1882, was\r\nfollowed up by other important, though subsidiary meetings, at the\r\ninstance of the Prince of Wales, who was now fully set on the success of\r\nhis grand scheme. As, formerly, he had been ably supported by the\r\nspeeches of the Duke of Edinburgh, the lamented Prince Leopold, Duke of\r\nAlbany, and Prince Christian, at influential meetings in Manchester, so\r\nnow he enlisted the Duke of Connaught in the cause, who addressed, with\r\ngreat ability and tact, a meeting of Merchants, Bankers, and leading men\r\nin the City, at the Mansion House, on the 20th of March, the Lord Mayor\r\nin the Chair.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with this, the Prince of Wales invited a large number of\r\ninfluential gentlemen connected with the Colonial Empire to meet him at\r\nMarlborough House, on Thursday, the 23rd of March, 1882, to consider\r\nwhat steps could be taken to secure the benefits of the Royal College of\r\nMusic for all parts of the Empire. The record of the origin of this\r\ngreat institution would not be complete without giving the speech of His\r\nRoyal Highness on that occasion. The following is the address delivered\r\nat that meeting:--\r\n\r\n    \"You are, doubtless, aware of the efforts at present being made\r\n    to establish a Royal College of Music--a work which, I venture\r\n    to think, is one of national importance.\r\n\r\n    \"It is intended to place the institution on a broad and liberal\r\n    basis; that its advantages shall not be confined to residents of\r\n    the United Kingdom, but be open to our fellow-subjects in all\r\n    parts of the Empire; and the gratuitous education of scholars,\r\n    selected by competition on the claim of merit only, will be one\r\n    of its principal features.\r\n\r\n    \"The scheme has been received with marked favour throughout the\r\n    United Kingdom, but I should consider it wanting in one of its\r\n    main objects if I did not succeed in enlisting the sympathy and\r\n    co-operation of our fellow-subjects residing in the Colonial\r\n    portions of the Empire.\r\n\r\n    \"I have on so many occasions experienced the advantages of their\r\n    ready and earnest concert in promoting schemes of public utility\r\n    in relation to material progress, that I have some confidence\r\n    they will exhibit the like friendly rivalry in furthering our\r\n    efforts in favour of an elevating pursuit, which in all ages and\r\n    among all communities has exercised no slight influence on\r\n    national character, and the promotion of which may constitute a\r\n    bond tending to unite us as strongly in sentiment and feeling as\r\n    we now are in loyalty and material interest.\r\n\r\n    \"For these reasons I was anxious to meet as many of the leading\r\n    gentlemen connected with the Colonies as might now be\r\n    temporarily in London, as well as those who permanently reside\r\n    here; and I am gratified at the readiness with which so many of\r\n    you have acceded to my invitation.\r\n\r\n    \"My object is partly to make it understood how much importance I\r\n    attach to the element of Colonial co-operation and sympathy, not\r\n    only as affecting the immediate success of the work, but bearing\r\n    on the higher objects of national unity, by inspiring among our\r\n    fellow-subjects in every part of the Empire those emotions of\r\n    patriotism which national music is calculated so powerfully to\r\n    evoke.\r\n\r\n    \"I further desired to apprise you of the steps which had been\r\n    and were being taken to carry out this purpose.\r\n\r\n    \"Immediately after the Meeting at St. James's Palace I directed\r\n    that full reports of the proceedings should be prepared, with\r\n    the view of transmitting them to Lord Kimberley, the Secretary\r\n    of State for the Colonies, to be forwarded by him for the\r\n    information of the Governments of the various Colonies, in the\r\n    hope that the good-will of these Governments might be attracted\r\n    in our favour, and such public encouragement afforded as they\r\n    might feel it becoming to extend.\r\n\r\n    \"It seemed doubtful, however, whether an official communication\r\n    of this character was calculated to accomplish the full object\r\n    we had in view, viz. to stimulate popular feeling and sympathy\r\n    among our Colonial fellow-subjects. It was thought that such an\r\n    end might be better attained by a direct appeal to themselves\r\n    and by a more general distribution of the reports of our\r\n    proceedings among the various institutions, religious bodies,\r\n    heads of municipalities, and leading persons in the Colonies.\r\n\r\n    \"I accordingly propose to supplement this communication by a\r\n    further letter, and to send a sufficient number of copies of our\r\n    proceedings to meet the necessary requirements, for transmission\r\n    to the Colonies.\r\n\r\n    \"I am not insensible to the engrossing nature of the pursuits of\r\n    Colonial life, nor to the claims which material interests have\r\n    on young communities. We must all recognise with pride and\r\n    admiration how much the enlightened enterprise and perseverance\r\n    of our Colonial fellow-subjects have already contributed to the\r\n    greatness and wealth of the Empire; and I am far from suggesting\r\n    any relaxation of these efforts.\r\n\r\n    \"My purpose is to provide for the leisure hours which must come\r\n    to the busiest among us--no matter where we live or what sphere\r\n    of life we occupy--an elevating source of enjoyment, which is at\r\n    the same time calculated to strengthen those emotions that have\r\n    so much influence in perpetuating a common love of country.\r\n\r\n    \"I have endeavoured in my further letter to Lord Kimberley to\r\n    convey fully the object I have at heart; and, although its terms\r\n    are in some measure a repetition of what I have now stated to\r\n    you, I think it well you should be apprised of its contents:--\r\n\r\n    \"'MY LORD,--I am anxious that no possible steps should be\r\n    omitted which may be calculated to bring the proposal to found a\r\n    Royal College of Music under the favourable notice of Her\r\n    Majesty's subjects in the Colonies.\r\n\r\n    \"'It appears to me that the communication which I request you in\r\n    the accompanying letter to be good enough to transmit for the\r\n    information of the Governments of the various Colonies might\r\n    advantageously be supplemented by a somewhat more general\r\n    distribution within these Colonies of the proceedings which have\r\n    taken place here in connection with the movement.\r\n\r\n    \"'The objects of such distribution would be to awaken public\r\n    interest among all classes of Her Majesty's subjects more\r\n    thoroughly than even proposals on the part of any of the\r\n    Colonial Governments to extend their practical aid are\r\n    calculated to do.\r\n\r\n    \"'I have therefore directed further copies of these proceedings\r\n    to be transmitted to you, and would again request that you will\r\n    be good enough to forward these further copies, for distribution\r\n    among such religious or educational institutions, Municipal or\r\n    other Public Bodies, or private persons in the various Colonies,\r\n    as may be thought most likely to help the project.\r\n\r\n    \"'I trust that the efforts now being made here may meet with\r\n    general support on the part of the Clergy of all denominations\r\n    in the Colonies, and that they, as well as the Heads of Colleges\r\n    and Municipal Bodies, may interest themselves in their several\r\n    localities to make known the advantages offered by the\r\n    establishment of the Royal College of Music, and especially that\r\n    all these advantages (including free instruction) will be open\r\n    as unreservedly to Her Majesty's Colonial subjects as to those\r\n    residing in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n    \"'Her Majesty's Colonial subjects have indeed already shown that\r\n    the possession of musical talent exists among them in as great a\r\n    degree as in any other nation, for they may claim with pride\r\n    that they have produced one of the most accomplished vocalists\r\n    of the present age.\r\n\r\n    \"'I have in past years had occasion in many ways--especially\r\n    through the medium of the various International Exhibitions over\r\n    which I have presided--to notice the manifold benefits which\r\n    have resulted from the combined action of the Colonies and the\r\n    Mother Country in the development of commerce and the\r\n    advancement of industrial and other material interests, and I\r\n    cannot but think that the friendly rivalry of all portions of\r\n    the Empire will not now be wanting in the effort to cultivate a\r\n    refined and elevating pursuit which in all ages and among all\r\n    nations has exercised so important an influence on national\r\n    character, and done so much to strengthen the common love of\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    \"'I have the more confidence in making this appeal, from the\r\n    readiness and public spirit which the Colonies have always\r\n    evinced to promote every object tending to strengthen the ties\r\n    that now so happily unite us.\r\n\r\n    \"'Your Lordship will, I am sure, be glad to learn that I have\r\n    had the advantage of communicating with a number of gentlemen\r\n    resident in several of the Colonies, who are temporarily in\r\n    England, as well as with former Colonists permanently residing\r\n    here, and they have kindly undertaken by their individual\r\n    exertions to further the present more extended movement, which I\r\n    trust will also meet with your Lordship's encouragement and\r\n    approval.\r\n\r\n    \"'I have the honour, &c.,\r\n\r\n    \"'ALBERT EDWARD, P.'\r\n\r\n    \"I have no doubt but that the different Colonial Governments\r\n    will exercise a judicious discretion in the use of these papers,\r\n    and that we may rely on their hearty co-operation and support in\r\n    applying them to the best advantage.\r\n\r\n    \"If there are any gentlemen present who may think themselves\r\n    warranted by their connections with the Colonies in aiding to\r\n    insure a friendly reception of my communication there, it will\r\n    be a source of gratification both to me and my colleagues to\r\n    view such efforts, so entirely in unison with our own, and to\r\n    welcome them as fellow-workers in the same cause.\r\n\r\n    \"I have thus endeavoured to place before you the object we have\r\n    in view, and the means by which we hope to accomplish it, and I\r\n    trust you will find both worthy of your support.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not, therefore, presume to indicate the precise course\r\n    which it might be expedient to adopt in any of the Colonies,\r\n    believing that this had better be left to the practical sagacity\r\n    and zeal of our friends there, who must be considered to have\r\n    the best knowledge of what plans are most calculated to insure\r\n    local success. I have, however, thought that a brief reference\r\n    to some of the steps which are contributing to our success here,\r\n    as well as an enumeration, in a comprehensive form, of some of\r\n    the advantages which the College offers to Colonists, might be\r\n    attended with advantage, and, at all events, serve as a\r\n    groundwork for their operations.\r\n\r\n    \"I have, accordingly, directed a memorandum in that sense to be\r\n    prepared, which will be forwarded, with the other papers, to the\r\n    proper quarter.\r\n\r\n    \"In conclusion, I cannot but again express my cordial thanks to\r\n    the many gentlemen connected with the Colonies who have favoured\r\n    me with their attendance to-day, and repeat the expression of my\r\n    hope, not unmixed with a large measure of confidence, that your\r\n    encouragement and help may not be with-held from an undertaking\r\n    which may, I trust, in the fulness of time prove to be one more\r\n    of the many fibres in the silken cord that binds the Mother\r\n    Country to her Colonial offspring.\r\n\r\n    \"I would finally say that we shall be most happy to receive any\r\n    practical suggestion from our Colonial friends either here or\r\n    resident in the Colonies.\"\r\n\r\nLord Kimberley said that, as Colonial Minister, he would give every\r\nassistance in his power, by forwarding papers and information. Private\r\nindividuals in the Colonies might be willing to found scholarships, and\r\nhave the nomination of students; but any response on the part of the\r\nColonial Governments must be from their free and spontaneous action.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales said, at the opening of his speech, that he deemed\r\nthis work as \"one of national importance.\" It is because of the high\r\n\"imperial\" tone and spirit of the address, a spirit which it is pleasant\r\nto witness in all the Prince's public actions, that there is especial\r\ninterest attached to this meeting at Marlborough House in 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURATION OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC.\r\n\r\n_May 7th, 1883._\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of inaugurating the Royal College of Music took place on\r\nthe 7th of May, 1883, in the presence of a small but select company. The\r\nbuilding, hitherto used by the National Training School of Music, has\r\nrooms amply sufficient for teaching purposes, but not large enough for a\r\nlarge assembly. By permission of Her Majesty's Commissioners for the\r\nExhibition of 1851, the use of rooms in the Albert Hall for choral and\r\ninstrumental practice was granted to the College.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, accompanied by the Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess\r\nof Edinburgh, and the Princess Christian, was received by the Trustees,\r\nthe Duke of Westminster, Lord Charles Bruce, Sir Richard Wallace, M.P.,\r\nSir John Rose, Sir George Grove, and the honorary secretary, Mr. Charles\r\nMorley. Among the company were many distinguished persons and eminent\r\nmusicians. The Archbishop of Canterbury offered the following special\r\nprayer: \"O God, who art the only author of order and beauty, Bless, we\r\nbeseech Thee, this College to the perfecting of science and skill in Thy\r\npure gift of Music; and grant that the good intent of its Founders may\r\nbe so answered in the diligence and virtue of its students, that both\r\nthe restful delight of man, and the glory of the Divine worship may be\r\nenhanced ever more and more; through Jesus Christ Our Lord. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nThe collect, \"Prevent us, O Lord,\" and the Lord's Prayer, closed the\r\nreligious service. Sir George Grove, Director, then said: \"It is now\r\nalmost exactly fourteen months since your Royal Highness held the\r\nremarkable meeting which assembled at St. James's Palace on the 28th of\r\nFebruary, 1882, and in which your proposition of the Royal College of\r\nMusic was launched on the country. It may well be called\r\nremarkable--first, because of the place in which it was held; secondly,\r\nbecause of the lucid and exhaustive statement which your Royal Highness\r\nvouchsafed to address to it; thirdly, because for the first time in\r\nEnglish history music was taken out of the domain of personal and\r\nprofessional questions to which it is too often relegated, and placed\r\nupon that national basis which its social and civilising powers entitle\r\nit to demand. Your Royal Highness's hearers embraced many of the most\r\ndistinguished English musicians of the day, but these were not the main\r\nconstituents of the meeting. The bulk of your audience consisted of the\r\nrepresentatives of the counties, cities, and towns of England, the lords\r\nlieutenant, mayors, and town clerks of the United Kingdom, while\r\nsurrounding your Royal Highness on the platform were His Royal Highness\r\nthe Duke of Edinburgh, the leader of the Government, the leader of the\r\nOpposition, the head of the Established Church, an eminent Scotch peer,\r\nand the Lord Mayor of London. A meeting so truly national in its aspect\r\ngave, if I may use a not inappropriate figure, the key-note of the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\"The hope so long entertained by your Royal Highness, and your advisers,\r\nthat the chief existing musical institution of the country would join\r\nyour movement, was unfortunately dissipated. But the absence of the\r\nRoyal Academy of Music from your Royal Highness's project was\r\ncounterbalanced by the active adherence of the towns and cities of the\r\ncountry which through their municipal officers, with hardly an\r\nexception, rallied as if by instinct round a movement so boldly\r\nconceived and so happily inaugurated. The key-note thus struck at St.\r\nJames's Palace resounded through the country, and met with a ready and\r\nharmonious response. Meetings were speedily organised by the lords\r\nlieutenant and mayors in the provinces. In the short period of fourteen\r\nmonths forty-four meetings have been held--from Exeter, Plymouth, and\r\nHastings, in the South, to Newcastle-on-Tyne in the North; from Swansea\r\nand Shrewsbury, on the one hand, to Lincoln and Norwich on the other;\r\nwhile the great manufacturing and commercial centres of Nottingham,\r\nLeicester, Leeds, Bradford, Liverpool, and Blackburn, have all testified\r\ntheir interest in your Royal Highness's new institution. In the City of\r\nLondon several meetings were held at the Mansion House, and a remarkable\r\ngathering of provincial mayors, under the sympathetic presidency of Sir.\r\nJ. Whittaker Ellis, the then Lord Mayor, gave your Royal Highness an\r\nopportunity of again enforcing your views upon your audience. By these\r\nmeetings, and by the personal exertions of your Royal Highness and your\r\nillustrious brothers, a sum of money, amounting to over £110,000, has\r\nbeen raised, of which nearly £5000 was due to the gracious action of Her\r\nRoyal Highness the Princess of Wales.\"\r\n\r\nSir George Grove announced \"the foundation already of many scholarships\r\nfor tuition, fifteen of which include maintenance. Four of the\r\nscholarships were founded by private liberality, and two by Australian\r\nbenefactors.\" He then announced \"the names of the professors selected by\r\nthe Prince of Wales for the teaching of the College, who were such as to\r\ngive assurance as in the quality and range of the instruction. The piano\r\nis in the hands of Mr. Pauer, Madame Arabella Goddard, Mr. Franklin\r\nTaylor, and Mr. John Francis Barnett. To forward our interests, Madame\r\nLind-Goldschmidt has emerged from her retirement, and singing will be\r\ntaught by her, Mr. Deacon, and Signor Visetti. The violin is in the\r\ncharge of Mr. Henry Holmes and Mr. Gompertz; the organ of Mr. Walter\r\nParratt. Counterpoint and composition are taught by Dr. Bridge, Mr.\r\nVilliers Stanford, and Dr. Hubert Parry; while among the professors of\r\nother instruments are the honoured names of Harper, Lazarus, Thomas, and\r\nother ornaments of the English school. Declamation will be specially\r\ncared for, and for this the names of Mrs. Kendal and Mrs. Arthur\r\nStirling are sufficient guarantee.\r\n\r\n\"The competition,\" continued Sir George Grove, \"which has taken place\r\nthroughout the country for the fifty scholarships is in itself an ample\r\nproof, if proof were needed, of the justness of your Royal Highness's\r\nidea. Following the method adopted in launching the institution, your\r\nRoyal Highness appealed to the mayors, corporations, and Local Boards\r\nthroughout the country, and in the Metropolitan districts to the\r\nVestries, to make known the fact of the competition, and to organise the\r\npreliminary examinations, selecting the examiners from the must eminent\r\nlocal musicians. The result was as successful as might have been\r\nanticipated. The municipal buildings were put at the disposal of the\r\nCollege, and the best musicians were prompt to give their services as\r\nhonorary local examiners to a task which in many cases involved great\r\nlabour and severe sacrifice. Throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland\r\n1588 candidates sent in their names as competitors. Of these 480 were\r\nsent up to the final examination, which was conducted personally in this\r\nbuilding by the various professors in sections; and, lastly, before the\r\nentire Board of Professors and myself as Director. The result was the\r\nunanimous election of seventeen scholars for the pianoforte, thirteen\r\nfor singing, eight for the violin, six for composition, two for the\r\nvioloncello, one for the organ, one for the clarionet, one for the\r\nflute, and one for the harp. In addition to the fifty scholars,\r\nforty-two persons have entered their names as paying students in the\r\nCollege. Time will not allow me more than an allusion to various acts of\r\nprivate generosity by which the College has benefited. Prominent among\r\nthem is the gift of the library of the late Sacred Harmonic Society,\r\nthrough Sir Philip Cunliffe Owen, and various other gifts of pianos,\r\nfurniture, &c., by Sir Charles Freake, Messrs. Broadwood, Messrs. Erard,\r\nMessrs. Chappell, Messrs. Holland, Feetham, and others. The professors,\r\nscholars, and students are awaiting your Royal Highness's notice at the\r\nclose of these proceedings, and I trust your Royal Highness will\r\nbelieve that we are all alike animated by a sincere and enthusiastic\r\ndesire to carry out to the full those wise and gracious designs which\r\nhave brought us to this first step in our career. That your Royal\r\nHighness may long live to preside over us and guide us in the right path\r\nis, Sir, our humble and earnest hope and prayer.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, in reply, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have heard your address with pleasure, and I feel great\r\n    gratification in opening to-day the Royal College of Music, in\r\n    the promotion of which I have taken so deep an interest. I avail\r\n    myself of this, the first public opportunity that has offered\r\n    itself, of expressing the deep personal gratification I feel at\r\n    the manner in which the country has replied to my appeal for aid\r\n    in establishing the College. There is no class of Her Majesty's\r\n    subjects capable of affording assistance to which I have\r\n    addressed myself in vain. The Corporation of London and the\r\n    London companies have led the way in giving pecuniary\r\n    assistance; and I owe a debt of gratitude to the Mayors\r\n    throughout the kingdom for the valuable aid they have afforded\r\n    by granting facilities for holding local examinations essential\r\n    to the proper selection of scholars. I thank these great bodies\r\n    for their services, and I trust that I may yet expect from them\r\n    further help in completing the task so auspiciously begun. I\r\n    thank the donors of scholarships for their liberality. I thank\r\n    the general public for the sums they have subscribed at a time\r\n    when agriculture has been depressed and the prospects of trade\r\n    have not been encouraging; and, above all, I thank the many kind\r\n    friends who have responded so cordially and liberally to my\r\n    appeal for assistance. I have noticed also with the greatest\r\n    pleasure the contributions for Colonial scholarships that have\r\n    been given by two eminent colonists, the one on behalf of the\r\n    colony of Victoria, and the other on behalf of the colony of\r\n    South Australia. The object I have in view is essentially\r\n    Imperial as well as national, and I trust that ere long there\r\n    will be no colony of any importance which is not represented by\r\n    a scholar at the Royal College.\r\n\r\n    \"Much, indeed, has been done, but I am aware that much remains\r\n    to be done. I am conscious that I may be thought to have taken a\r\n    bold step in beginning so great an enterprise with only the\r\n    resources at present at my command. But I am unwilling that any\r\n    delay should take place in giving effect to the generous\r\n    intentions of those who have already contributed so liberally. I\r\n    am sanguine enough to think that the example set during the last\r\n    year by corporate bodies, representatives of the colonies,\r\n    private donors, and the general public will be followed in\r\n    ensuing years. Ours is an institution which admits of almost\r\n    indefinite extension, for, wherever a scholarship is founded, we\r\n    know now that we shall find a deserving candidate to hold it.\r\n\r\n    \"Let me now pass to an account of what has been actually\r\n    accomplished. Fifty scholarships have been established, of which\r\n    thirty-five confer a free education in music, and fifteen\r\n    provide not only a free education, but also maintenance for the\r\n    scholars. Of these scholarships half are held by boys and half\r\n    by girls. I observe with pleasure that the various districts\r\n    from which the scholars are drawn indicate the widespread\r\n    distribution of a taste for music, and an adequate cultivation\r\n    of music throughout the United Kingdom. London, with its vast\r\n    population, sends only twelve out of the fifty. The remaining\r\n    thirty-eight come as follows:--twenty-eight from fourteen\r\n    different counties in England, two from Scotland, six from\r\n    Ireland, one from Wales, and one from Jersey. The occupations of\r\n    the scholars are as various as the places from which they come.\r\n    I find that a mill-girl, the daughter of a brickmaker, and the\r\n    son of a blacksmith take high places in singing, and the son of\r\n    a labourer in violin playing.\r\n\r\n    \"The capacity of these candidates has been tested by an\r\n    examination of unusual severity. Each of these scholars who\r\n    returns to his native place furnished with the highest\r\n    instruction in music will form a centre from which good musical\r\n    education will spread around; while those who obtain musical\r\n    engagements elsewhere will stimulate and encourage by their\r\n    success the cultivation of music in the places whence they have\r\n    come. Surely, then, it is not too much to expect that many years\r\n    will not pass away before our College has so popularised music\r\n    as to place England on a par with those countries on the\r\n    Continent which have acquired the distinction of being called\r\n    musical people.\r\n\r\n    \"I feel, then, that one great object of a College of Music has\r\n    been secured--namely, the discovery of latent musical ability\r\n    and the extension to those who, with great natural gifts, have\r\n    been blessed with little of this world's goods, of the\r\n    opportunity of obtaining instruction in music, to say the\r\n    least, not inferior to any which this kingdom can afford. That\r\n    these words are not the language of exaggeration will be\r\n    apparent to those who read the names of the eminent staff who\r\n    have placed their services at the disposal of the College. Side\r\n    by side with these scholars will be educated a group of paying\r\n    pupils, who think that music is an art which, if worth studying\r\n    at all, is worth studying well. They are, then, prepared to\r\n    enter on a systematic course of instruction, of less severity\r\n    and continuance than that of the scholars, but still far removed\r\n    from the musical dilettantism of those who, induced by fashion,\r\n    not by taste, to study music, make progress enough to torment\r\n    themselves and distract their friends.\r\n\r\n    \"I lay great store by the meeting of the various classes of\r\n    society in pursuit of a common yet elevating study. Such a union\r\n    softens asperities, inspires kindly feeling between various\r\n    classes, and proves that all mankind are akin when engaged in an\r\n    art which gives the highest expression to some of the best and\r\n    purest feelings of the human heart.\r\n\r\n    \"The observations I have hitherto made relate only to the Royal\r\n    College of Music in its character of a teaching body. It is not\r\n    proposed, however, that the functions of the College should be\r\n    restricted to teaching. The charter under which we are\r\n    incorporated provides that the council are to cause examinations\r\n    to be held of pupils of the College, and of other persons who\r\n    may present themselves for examination, and after examination to\r\n    confer on those who deserve such distinctions the degrees of\r\n    Bachelor of Music, Master of Music, and Doctor of Music,\r\n    certificates of proficiency, and other rewards. I propose that\r\n    this power should be exercised by an independent board of\r\n    examiners chosen by the Royal College in conjunction with the\r\n    Universities, and after consultation with the great musical\r\n    authorities of the United Kingdom. I trust thus to secure an\r\n    examining body whose impartiality will be above suspicion and\r\n    capacity beyond all question. I hope thus, through the\r\n    instrumentality of the Royal College, to raise the standard of\r\n    music throughout the United Kingdom and to create a central\r\n    influence which may be beneficially exercised over all\r\n    music-teaching bodies who recognise the advantage of a common\r\n    system of examination.\r\n\r\n    \"Beyond and above all this I trust, as I stated on a previous\r\n    occasion, that the College will become the recognised centre and\r\n    head of the musical world in this country. It has been a\r\n    reproach to England that, with her vast resources, her large\r\n    benevolence, her eagerness to instruct all classes of society in\r\n    other branches of knowledge, one thing has hitherto been\r\n    wanting--a national institution for music. Yet music is in the\r\n    best sense the most popular of all arts. If that government be\r\n    the best which provides for the happiness of the greatest\r\n    number, that art must be the best which at the least expense\r\n    pleases the greatest number. I trust that to-day we have removed\r\n    the reproach. England, by a national subscription, has acquired\r\n    an institution worthy to be called national, and with the\r\n    establishment of such an institution we may look forward with\r\n    confidence to the creation of a national school of music.\r\n    England has the composers already; all she wants is a general\r\n    centre, such as a Royal College of Music, to which they may\r\n    resort for mutual aid and common inspiration.\r\n\r\n    \"Such are the aims, not mean nor ignoble aims, proposed for the\r\n    College which we open to-day. It remains for you, gentlemen of\r\n    the council, to be careful that the aims are fully realised. A\r\n    young institution requires fostering care and constant\r\n    supervision. You must not relax your efforts, no pains must be\r\n    spared to gain fresh support and obtain the establishment of new\r\n    scholarships. We want much; we are, I trust, entitled to ask for\r\n    much of the public. In addition to scholarships we want more\r\n    extended premises, a music-hall, lodgings for our scholars,\r\n    houses for masters, and all the appurtenances of a great\r\n    College. I am sure I may trust to the generosity of the public\r\n    to supply these wants; but you, gentlemen, must by your careful\r\n    supervision make our institution worthy of support, and no\r\n    efforts of mine shall be wanting to secure the objects we have\r\n    in view.\r\n\r\n    \"I will say only one word in conclusion. The establishment of an\r\n    institution such as I open to-day is not the mere creation of a\r\n    new musical society. The time has come when class can no longer\r\n    stand aloof from class, and that man does his duty best who\r\n    works most earnestly in bridging over the gulf between different\r\n    classes which it is the tendency of increased wealth and\r\n    increased civilisation to widen. I claim for music the merit\r\n    that it has a voice which speaks, in different tones, perhaps,\r\n    but with equal force, to the cultivated and the ignorant, to the\r\n    peer and the peasant. I claim for music a variety of expression\r\n    which belongs to no other art, and therefore adapts it more than\r\n    any other art to produce that union of feeling which I much\r\n    desire to promote. Lastly, I claim for music the distinction\r\n    which is awarded to it by Addison--that it is the only sensuous\r\n    pleasure in which excess cannot be injurious. What, more,\r\n    gentlemen, can I say on behalf of the art for the promotion of\r\n    which we are to-day opening this institution--an institution\r\n    which I trust will give to music a new impulse, a glorious\r\n    future, and a national life? Before I quit this room a further\r\n    duty devolves on me--a most gratifying one, I admit. I am called\r\n    upon to announce a most gracious act by which the Queen has been\r\n    pleased to mark her interest in the opening of the Royal\r\n    College. Her Majesty authorises me to say that she proposes to\r\n    confer the honour of knighthood on Professor Macfarren and Dr.\r\n    Sullivan. If anything could add to my satisfaction in making\r\n    this statement it is this, that these honours are bestowed by\r\n    the advice of the Prime Minister, who has taken so kind an\r\n    interest in the promotion of the Royal College, and who could\r\n    have devised no better mode of celebrating its opening than by\r\n    recommending that honour should be done on this occasion to\r\n    music by conferring knighthood on men so celebrated in their art\r\n    as Professor Macfarren and Dr. Sullivan, and that honour should\r\n    be done to our college by awarding a like distinction to its\r\n    director, Dr. Grove, who, eminent in general literature, has\r\n    specially devoted himself to the preparation and publication of\r\n    a dictionary of music, and has earned our gratitude by the skill\r\n    and success with which he has worked in the difficult task of\r\n    organising the Royal College. I have only to add that the Prime\r\n    Minister (Mr. Gladstone) by his presence to-day proves that\r\n    neither the cares of State, nor the overwhelming press of\r\n    business by which he is surrounded, prevents him from giving\r\n    personal countenance to a national undertaking which, if I am\r\n    right in what I have said, is calculated to advance the\r\n    happiness and elevate the character of the English people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal College of Music, incorporated by Royal Charter in 1883, is\r\nnow one of the established institutions of the Empire. There lies before\r\nus the Report of the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Corporation, with\r\nReport of the Council and other official documents and statements. This\r\nmeeting was held at the Concert Hall of the Alexandra House, adjoining\r\nthe College, on Tuesday, July 24th, 1888, Prince Christian, K.G., one of\r\nthe Vice-Presidents, in the chair. There was a very large attendance of\r\nthe Council, members of the Corporation, teachers and pupils of the\r\nCollege. The Report of the Council was of the most satisfactory nature.\r\nThe progress of the pupils has been very encouraging, and the discipline\r\nand efficiency of the College thoroughly well maintained. The number of\r\nfoundation scholars at the end of April, 1888, was fifty-nine. Its\r\nnumber of paying students on the books at the same date, was 170, an\r\nincrease of 24, during the preceding twelve months. These students were\r\nin various years of their training. The total number of pupils was 229.\r\n\r\nThe Examiners, Mr. W. G. Cusins, Sir Charles Hallé, Mr. C. H. Lloyd, Mr.\r\nA. Randegger, Mr. Carl Rosa, and Mr. Prosper Sainton, gave a most\r\nfavourable report of steady progress, especially by the students of\r\nstringed instruments, piano, and organ. As an educational institution,\r\nthe Royal College has already proved itself able to exert a powerful\r\ninfluence on the condition of musical art in this country.\r\n\r\nThe results of examinations and competitions were then given in detail,\r\nand various incidents of the year were recorded, including visits of Dr.\r\nJoachim and Dr. Hans Richter, who delighted the pupils by their presence\r\nand their performing. Various changes in the teaching staff were\r\nannounced. The finances of the College are in good state, the available\r\nbalance at the close of the year being nearly £2484, a clear increase\r\nduring the past year of nearly £470. Various donations and benefactions\r\nwere reported, but the great event of the meeting--which H.R.H. Prince\r\nChristian announced with a cheerful emphasis, in keeping with the warm\r\ninterest he has always taken in the College--this was the generous gift\r\nof £30,000 by Mr. Samson Fox, for a building worthy of the institution;\r\nmet by Her Majesty's Commissioners of 1851 by the grant of a site on\r\ntheir estate at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nWe must not give more space to this subject of the Royal College of\r\nMusic. Those who wish further information must apply to the Secretary or\r\nDirector of the College.
