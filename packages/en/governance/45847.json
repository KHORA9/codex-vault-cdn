Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson having, by his last will and testament, bequeathed to\r\nhis grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, all his manuscript papers,\r\nCongress, by an act of the 12th of April, 1848, made an appropriation\r\nfor the purpose of purchasing them for the Government; and, by the\r\nsame act, an additional appropriation was made to print and publish\r\nthem under the direction and supervision of the Joint Committee on\r\nthe Library. It is under the authority of this act that the present\r\npublication is made. The immense mass of manuscript left by Mr.\r\nJefferson having been deposited with the Editor, he has carefully gone\r\nthrough the whole, and selected from it, for the present publication,\r\neverything which possesses permanent public interest either on account\r\nof its intrinsic value, or as matter of history, or as illustrating\r\nthe character of the distinguished Author, or as embodying his views\r\nupon the almost infinite variety of topics, philosophical, moral,\r\nreligious, scientific, historical, and political, so ably discussed\r\nby him--thus making this work a complete depository of the writings\r\nof Thomas Jefferson. Under the view which the Editor has taken of his\r\neditorial duties, and the instructions of the Library Committee, he has\r\nnot felt himself at liberty to encumber the publication with matter of\r\nhis own farther than is necessary to illustrate the text. Such notes as\r\nhave been appended will, therefore, be found to be purely explanatory\r\nand historical in their character. Under the impression that the value\r\nof such publications as the present depends much upon facility of\r\nreference, a particular Index has been appended to each volume as well\r\nas a general Index to the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS TO VOL.

The Autobiography extends to the 21st of\r\nMarch, 1790, when Mr. Jefferson arrived in New York to enter upon the\r\nduties of the Department of State, and embraces a variety of important\r\nsubjects, such as the rise and progress of the difficulties between\r\nGreat Britain and her North American Colonies--the circumstances\r\nconnected with the Declaration of Independence--the debates in Congress\r\nupon the adoption thereof, as reduced to writing by Mr. Jefferson\r\nat the time--the history of the Articles of Confederation--early\r\nstages of the French Revolution--revision of the Penal Code of\r\nVirginia--abolition of her laws of Primogeniture--overthrow of her\r\nChurch Establishment--Act of Religious Freedom, &c.--all matter\r\ninteresting in itself, but rendered particularly so by the fact that\r\nit comes from one who was himself a chief actor in the scenes which he\r\ndescribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nAUTOBIOGRAPHY, WITH APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 6, 1821. At the age of 77, I begin to make some memoranda, and\r\nstate some recollections of dates and facts concerning myself, for my\r\nown more ready reference, and for the information of my family.\r\n\r\nThe tradition in my father's family was, that their ancestor came to\r\nthis country from Wales, and from near the mountain of Snowdon, the\r\nhighest in Great Britain. I noted once a case from Wales, in the law\r\nreports, where a person of our name was either plaintiff or defendant;\r\nand one of the same name was secretary to the Virginia Company. These\r\nare the only instances in which I have met with the name in that\r\ncountry. I have found it in our early records; but the first particular\r\ninformation I have of any ancestor was of my grandfather, who lived\r\nat the place in Chesterfield called Ozborne's, and owned the lands\r\nafterwards the glebe of the parish. He had three sons; Thomas who died\r\nyoung, Field who settled on the waters of Roanoke and left numerous\r\ndescendants, and Peter, my father, who settled on the lands I still\r\nown, called Shadwell, adjoining my present residence. He was born\r\nFebruary 29, 1707-8, and intermarried 1739, with Jane Randolph, of\r\nthe age of 19, daughter of Isham Randolph, one of the seven sons of\r\nthat name and family, settled at Dungeoness in Goochland. They trace\r\ntheir pedigree far back in England and Scotland, to which let every one\r\nascribe the faith and merit he chooses.\r\n\r\nMy father's education had been quite neglected; but being of a strong\r\nmind, sound judgment, and eager after information, he read much\r\nand improved himself, insomuch that he was chosen, with Joshua Fry,\r\nProfessor of Mathematics in William and Mary college, to continue\r\nthe boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina, which had been\r\nbegun by Colonel Byrd; and was afterwards employed with the same Mr.\r\nFry, to make the first map of Virginia which had ever been made, that\r\nof Captain Smith being merely a conjectural sketch. They possessed\r\nexcellent materials for so much of the country as is below the blue\r\nridge; little being then known beyond that ridge. He was the third\r\nor fourth settler, about the year 1737, of the part of the country in\r\nwhich I live. He died, August 17th, 1757, leaving my mother a widow,\r\nwho lived till 1776, with six daughters and two sons, myself the\r\nelder. To my younger brother he left his estate on James River, called\r\nSnowden, after the supposed birth-place of the family: to myself, the\r\nlands on which I was born and live.\r\n\r\nHe placed me at the English school at five years of age; and at the\r\nLatin at nine, where I continued until his death. My teacher, Mr.\r\nDouglas, a clergyman from Scotland, with the rudiments of the Latin and\r\nGreek languages, taught me the French; and on the death of my father, I\r\nwent to the Reverend Mr. Maury, a correct classical scholar, with whom\r\nI continued two years; and then, to wit, in the spring of 1760, went to\r\nWilliam and Mary college, where I continued two years. It was my great\r\ngood fortune, and what probably fixed the destinies of my life, that\r\nDr. William Small of Scotland, was then professor of Mathematics, a man\r\nprofound in most of the useful branches of science, with a happy talent\r\nof communication, correct and gentlemanly manners, and an enlarged and\r\nliberal mind. He, most happily for me, became soon attached to me, and\r\nmade me his daily companion when not engaged in the school; and from\r\nhis conversation I got my first views of the expansion of science,\r\nand of the system of things in which we are placed. Fortunately, the\r\nphilosophical chair became vacant soon after my arrival at college,\r\nand he was appointed to fill it _per interim_: and he was the first\r\nwho ever gave, in that college, regular lectures in Ethics, Rhetoric\r\nand Belles lettres. He returned to Europe in 1762, having previously\r\nfilled up the measure of his goodness to me, by procuring for me, from\r\nhis most intimate friend, George Wythe, a reception as a student of\r\nlaw, under his direction, and introduced me to the acquaintance and\r\nfamiliar table of Governor Fauquier, the ablest man who had ever filled\r\nthat office. With him, and at his table, Dr. Small and Mr. Wythe, his\r\n_amici omnium horarum_, and myself, formed a _partie quarree_, and to\r\nthe habitual conversations on these occasions I owed much instruction.\r\nMr. Wythe continued to be my faithful and beloved mentor in youth,\r\nand my most affectionate friend through life. In 1767, he led me into\r\nthe practice of the law at the bar of the General court, at which I\r\ncontinued until the Revolution shut up the courts of justice.[1]\r\n\r\nIn 1769, I became a member of the legislature by the choice of the\r\ncounty in which I live, and so continued until it was closed by the\r\nRevolution. I made one effort in that body for the permission of the\r\nemancipation of slaves, which was rejected: and indeed, during the\r\nregal government, nothing liberal could expect success. Our minds were\r\ncircumscribed within narrow limits, by an habitual belief that it was\r\nour duty to be subordinate to the mother country in all matters of\r\ngovernment, to direct all our labors in subservience to her interests,\r\nand even to observe a bigoted intolerance for all religions but\r\nhers. The difficulties with our representatives were of habit and\r\ndespair, not of reflection and conviction. Experience soon proved\r\nthat they could bring their minds to rights, on the first summons of\r\ntheir attention. But the King's Council, which acted as another house\r\nof legislature, held their places at will, and were in most humble\r\nobedience to that will: the Governor too, who had a negative on our\r\nlaws, held by the same tenure, and with still greater devotedness to\r\nit: and, last of all, the Royal negative closed the last door to every\r\nhope of amelioration.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1772, I was married to Martha Skelton, widow\r\nof Bathurst Skelton, and daughter of John Wayles, then twenty-three\r\nyears old. Mr. Wayles was a lawyer of much practice, to which he was\r\nintroduced more by his great industry, punctuality, and practical\r\nreadiness, than by eminence in the science of his profession. He was\r\na most agreeable companion, full of pleasantry and good humor, and\r\nwelcomed in every society. He acquired a handsome fortune, and died\r\nin May, 1773, leaving three daughters: the portion which came on\r\nthat event to Mrs. Jefferson, after the debts should be paid, which\r\nwere very considerable, was about equal to my own patrimony, and\r\nconsequently doubled the ease of our circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen the famous Resolutions of 1765, against the Stamp-act, were\r\nproposed, I was yet a student of law in Williamsburgh. I attended the\r\ndebate, however, at the door of the lobby of the House of Burgesses,\r\nand heard the splendid display of Mr. Henry's talents as a popular\r\norator. They were great indeed; such as I have never heard from any\r\nother man. He appeared to me to speak as Homer wrote. Mr. Johnson, a\r\nlawyer, and member from the Northern Neck, seconded the resolutions,\r\nand by him the learning and the logic of the case were chiefly\r\nmaintained. My recollections of these transactions may be seen page 60\r\nof the life of Patrick Henry, by Wirt, to whom I furnished them.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1769, a meeting of the General Assembly was called by the\r\nGovernor, Lord Botetourt. I had then become a member; and to that\r\nmeeting became known the joint resolutions and address of the\r\nLords and Commons, of 1768-9, on the proceedings in Massachusetts.\r\nCounter-resolutions, and an address to the King by the House of\r\nBurgesses, were agreed to with little opposition, and a spirit\r\nmanifestly displayed itself of considering the cause of Massachusetts\r\nas a common one. The Governor dissolved us: but we met the next day in\r\nthe Apollo[2] of the Raleigh tavern, formed ourselves into a voluntary\r\nconvention, drew up articles of association against the use of any\r\nmerchandise imported from Great Britain, signed and recommended them\r\nto the people, repaired to our several counties, and were re-elected\r\nwithout any other exception than of the very few who had declined\r\nassent to our proceedings.\r\n\r\nNothing of particular excitement occurring for a considerable time,\r\nour countrymen seemed to fall into a state of insensibility to our\r\nsituation; the duty on tea, not yet repealed, and the declaratory act\r\nof a right in the British Parliament to bind us by their laws in all\r\ncases whatsoever, still suspended over us. But a court of inquiry held\r\nin Rhode Island in 1762, with a power to send persons to England to be\r\ntried for offences committed here, was considered, at our session of\r\nthe spring of 1773, as demanding attention. Not thinking our old and\r\nleading members up to the point of forwardness and zeal which the times\r\nrequired, Mr. Henry, Richard Henry Lee, Francis L. Lee, Mr. Carr and\r\nmyself agreed to meet in the evening, in a private room of the Raleigh,\r\nto consult on the state of things. There may have been a member or two\r\nmore whom I do not recollect. We were all sensible that the most urgent\r\nof all measures was that of coming to an understanding with all the\r\nother colonies, to consider the British claims as a common cause to\r\nall, and to produce a unity of action: and, for this purpose, that a\r\ncommittee of correspondence in each colony would be the best instrument\r\nfor inter-communication: and that their first measure would probably\r\nbe, to propose a meeting of deputies from every colony, at some central\r\nplace, who should be charged with the direction of the measures which\r\nshould be taken by all. We, therefore, drew up the resolutions which\r\nmay be seen in Wirt, page 87. The consulting members proposed to me to\r\nmove them, but I urged that it should be done by Mr. Carr, my friend\r\nand brother-in-law, then a new member, to whom I wished an opportunity\r\nshould be given of making known to the house his great worth and\r\ntalents. It was so agreed; he moved them, they were agreed to _nem.\r\ncon._, and a committee of correspondence appointed, of whom Peyton\r\nRandolph, the speaker, was chairman. The Governor (then Lord Dunmore)\r\ndissolved us, but the committee met the next day, prepared a circular\r\nletter to the speakers of the other colonies, inclosing to each a\r\ncopy of the resolutions, and left it in charge with their chairman to\r\nforward them by expresses.\r\n\r\nThe origination of these committees of correspondence between the\r\ncolonies has been since claimed for Massachusetts, and Marshall[3] has\r\ngiven into this error, although the very note of his appendix to which\r\nhe refers, shows that their establishment was confined to their own\r\ntowns. This matter will be seen clearly stated in a letter of Samuel\r\nAdams Wells to me of April 2nd, 1819, and my answer of May 12th. I\r\nwas corrected by the letter of Mr. Wells in the information I had\r\ngiven Mr. Wirt, as stated in his note, page 87, that the messengers\r\nof Massachusetts and Virginia crossed each other on the way, bearing\r\nsimilar propositions; for Mr. Wells shows that Massachusetts did not\r\nadopt the measure, but on the receipt of our proposition, delivered at\r\ntheir next session. Their message, therefore, which passed ours, must\r\nhave related to something else, for I well remember Peyton Randolph's\r\ninforming me of the crossing of our messengers.[4]\r\n\r\nThe next event which excited our sympathies for Massachusetts, was\r\nthe Boston port bill, by which that port was to be shut up on the 1st\r\nof June, 1774. This arrived while we were in session in the spring\r\nof that year. The lead in the House, on these subjects, being no\r\nlonger left to the old members, Mr. Henry, R. H. Lee, Fr. L. Lee,\r\nthree or four other members, whom I do not recollect, and myself,\r\nagreeing that we must boldly take an unequivocal stand in the line with\r\nMassachusetts, determined to meet and consult on the proper measures,\r\nin the council-chamber, for the benefit of the library in that room.\r\nWe were under conviction of the necessity of arousing our people from\r\nthe lethargy into which they had fallen, as to passing events; and\r\nthought that the appointment of a day of general fasting and prayer\r\nwould be most likely to call up and alarm their attention. No example\r\nof such a solemnity had existed since the days of our distresses in the\r\nwar of '55, since which a new generation had grown up. With the help,\r\ntherefore, of Rushworth, whom we rummaged over for the revolutionary\r\nprecedents and forms of the Puritans of that day, preserved by him,\r\nwe cooked up a resolution, somewhat modernizing their phrases, for\r\nappointing the 1st day of June, on which the port-bill was to commence,\r\nfor a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer, to implore Heaven to\r\navert from us the evils of civil war, to inspire us with firmness\r\nin support of our rights, and to turn the hearts of the King and\r\nParliament to moderation and justice. To give greater emphasis to our\r\nproposition, we agreed to wait the next morning on Mr. Nicholas, whose\r\ngrave and religious character was more in unison with the tone of our\r\nresolution, and to solicit him to move it. We accordingly went to him\r\nin the morning. He moved it the same day; the 1st of June was proposed;\r\nand it passed without opposition. The Governor dissolved us, as\r\nusual. We retired to the Apollo, as before, agreed to an association,\r\nand instructed the committee of correspondence to propose to the\r\ncorresponding committees of the other colonies, to appoint deputies to\r\nmeet in Congress at such place, _annually_, as should be convenient,\r\nto direct, from time to time, the measures required by the general\r\ninterest: and we declared that an attack on any one colony, should\r\nbe considered as an attack on the whole. This was in May. We further\r\nrecommended to the several counties to elect deputies to meet at\r\nWilliamsburgh, the 1st of August ensuing, to consider the state of the\r\ncolony, and particularly to appoint delegates to a general Congress,\r\nshould that measure be acceded to by the committees of correspondence\r\ngenerally. It was acceded to; Philadelphia was appointed for the place,\r\nand the 5th of September for the time of meeting. We returned home, and\r\nin our several counties invited the clergy to meet assemblies of the\r\npeople on the 1st of June, to perform the ceremonies of the day, and\r\nto address to them discourses suited to the occasion. The people met\r\ngenerally, with anxiety and alarm in their countenances, and the effect\r\nof the day, through the whole colony, was like a shock of electricity,\r\narousing every man, and placing him erect and solidly on his centre.\r\nThey chose, universally, delegates for the convention. Being elected\r\none for my own county, I prepared a draught of instructions to be given\r\nto the delegates whom we should send to the Congress, which I meant\r\nto propose at our meeting.[5] In this I took the ground that, from\r\nthe beginning, I had thought the only one orthodox or tenable, which\r\nwas, that the relation between Great Britain and these colonies was\r\nexactly the same as that of England and Scotland, after the accession\r\nof James, and until the union, and the same as her present relations\r\nwith Hanover, having the same executive chief, but no other necessary\r\npolitical connection; and that our emigration from England to this\r\ncountry gave her no more rights over us, than the emigrations of the\r\nDanes and Saxons gave to the present authorities of the mother country,\r\nover England. In this doctrine, however, I had never been able to get\r\nany one to agree with me but Mr. Wythe. He concurred in it from the\r\nfirst dawn of the question, What was the political relation between\r\nus and England? Our other patriots, Randolph, the Lees, Nicholas,\r\nPendleton, stopped at the half-way house of John Dickinson, who\r\nadmitted that England had a right to regulate our commerce, and to\r\nlay duties on it for the purposes of regulation, but not of raising\r\nrevenue. But for this ground there was no foundation in compact, in any\r\nacknowledged principles of colonization, nor in reason: expatriation\r\nbeing a natural right, and acted on as such, by all nations, in all\r\nages. I set out for Williamsburg some days before that appointed for\r\nour meeting, but was taken ill of a dysentery on the road, and was\r\nunable to proceed. I sent on, therefore, to Williamsburgh, two copies\r\nof my draught, the one under cover to Peyton Randolph, who I knew would\r\nbe in the chair of the convention, the other to Patrick Henry. Whether\r\nMr. Henry disapproved the ground taken, or was too lazy to read it (for\r\nhe was the laziest man in reading I ever knew) I never learned: but\r\nhe communicated it to nobody. Peyton Randolph informed the convention\r\nhe had received such a paper from a member, prevented by sickness from\r\noffering it in his place, and he laid it on the table for perusal. It\r\nwas read generally by the members, approved by many, though thought too\r\nbold for the present state of things; but they printed it in pamphlet\r\nform, under the title of \"A Summary View of the Rights of British\r\nAmerica.\" It found its way to England, was taken up by the opposition,\r\ninterpolated a little by Mr. Burke so as to make it answer opposition\r\npurposes, and in that form ran rapidly through several editions. This\r\ninformation I had from Parson Hurt, who happened at the time to be\r\nin London, whither he had gone to receive clerical orders; and I was\r\ninformed afterwards by Peyton Randolph, that it had procured me the\r\nhonor of having my name inserted in a long list of proscriptions,\r\nenrolled in a bill of attainder commenced in one of the Houses of\r\nParliament, but suppressed in embryo by the hasty step of events, which\r\nwarned them to be a little cautious. Montague, agent of the House of\r\nBurgesses in England, made extracts from the bill, copied the names,\r\nand sent them to Peyton Randolph. The names, I think, were about\r\ntwenty, which he repeated to me, but I recollect those only of Hancock,\r\nthe two Adamses, Peyton Randolph himself, Patrick Henry, and myself.[6]\r\nThe convention met on the 1st of August, renewed their association,\r\nappointed delegates to the Congress, gave them instructions very\r\ntemperately and properly expressed, both as to style and matter;[7]\r\nand they repaired to Philadelphia at the time appointed. The splendid\r\nproceedings of that Congress, at their first session, belong to general\r\nhistory, are known to every one, and need not therefore be noted here.\r\nThey terminated their session on the 26th of October, to meet again\r\non the 10th of May ensuing. The convention, at their ensuing session\r\nof March, '75, approved of the proceedings of Congress, thanked their\r\ndelegates, and reappointed the same persons to represent the colony\r\nat the meeting to be held in May: and foreseeing the probability that\r\nPeyton Randolph, their president, and speaker also of the House of\r\nBurgesses, might be called off, they added me, in that event, to the\r\ndelegation.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph was, according to expectation, obliged to leave the chair\r\nof Congress, to attend the General Assembly summoned by Lord Dunmore,\r\nto meet on the 1st day of June, 1775. Lord North's conciliatory\r\npropositions, as they were called, had been received by the Governor,\r\nand furnished the subject for which this assembly was convened. Mr.\r\nRandolph accordingly attended, and the tenor of these propositions\r\nbeing generally known, as having been addressed to all the governors,\r\nhe was anxious that the answer of our Assembly, likely to be the first,\r\nshould harmonize with what he knew to be the sentiments and wishes of\r\nthe body he had recently left. He feared that Mr. Nicholas, whose mind\r\nwas not yet up to the mark of the times, would undertake the answer,\r\nand therefore pressed me to prepare it. I did so, and, with his aid,\r\ncarried it through the House, with long and doubtful scruples from\r\nMr. Nicholas and James Mercer, and a dash of cold water on it here\r\nand there, enfeebling it somewhat, but finally with unanimity, or\r\na vote approaching it. This being passed, I repaired immediately to\r\nPhiladelphia, and conveyed to Congress the first notice they had of\r\nit. It was entirely approved there. I took my seat with them on the\r\n21st of June. On the 24th, a committee which had been appointed to\r\nprepare a declaration of the causes of taking up arms, brought in their\r\nreport (drawn I believe by J. Rutledge) which, not being liked, the\r\nHouse recommitted it, on the 26th, and added Mr. Dickinson and myself\r\nto the committee. On the rising of the House, the committee having not\r\nyet met, I happened to find myself near Governor W. Livingston, and\r\nproposed to him to draw the paper. He excused himself and proposed\r\nthat I should draw it. On my pressing him with urgency, \"we are as\r\nyet but new acquaintances, sir,\" said he, \"why are you so earnest for\r\nmy doing it?\" \"Because,\" said I, \"I have been informed that you drew\r\nthe Address to the people of Great Britain, a production, certainly,\r\nof the finest pen in America.\" \"On that,\" says he, \"perhaps, sir, you\r\nmay not have been correctly informed.\" I had received the information\r\nin Virginia from Colonel Harrison on his return from that Congress.\r\nLee, Livingston, and Jay had been the committee for that draught.\r\nThe first, prepared by Lee, had been disapproved and recommitted. The\r\nsecond was drawn by Jay, but being presented by Governor Livingston,\r\nhad led Colonel Harrison into the error. The next morning, walking in\r\nthe hall of Congress, many members being assembled, but the House not\r\nyet formed, I observed Mr. Jay speaking to R. H. Lee, and leading him\r\nby the button of his coat to me. \"I understand, sir,\" said he to me,\r\n\"that this gentleman informed you, that Governor Livingston drew the\r\nAddress to the people of Great Britain.\" I assured him, at once, that\r\nI had not received that information from Mr. Lee, and that not a word\r\nhad ever passed on the subject between Mr. Lee and myself; and after\r\nsome explanations the subject was dropped. These gentlemen had had some\r\nsparrings in debate before, and continued ever very hostile to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nI prepared a draught of the declaration committed to us. It was too\r\nstrong for Mr. Dickinson. He still retained the hope of reconciliation\r\nwith the mother country, and was unwilling it should be lessened by\r\noffensive statements. He was so honest a man, and so able a one, that\r\nhe was greatly indulged even by those who could not feel his scruples.\r\nWe therefore requested him to take the paper, and put it into a form\r\nhe could approve. He did so, preparing an entire new statement, and\r\npreserving of the former only the last four paragraphs and half of\r\nthe preceding one. We approved and reported it to Congress, who\r\naccepted it. Congress gave a signal proof of their indulgence to\r\nMr. Dickinson, and of their great desire not to go too fast for any\r\nrespectable part of our body, in permitting him to draw their second\r\npetition to the King according to his own ideas, and passing it with\r\nscarcely any amendment. The disgust against this humility was general;\r\nand Mr. Dickinson's delight at its passage was the only circumstance\r\nwhich reconciled them to it. The vote being passed, although further\r\nobservation on it was out of order, he could not refrain from rising\r\nand expressing his satisfaction, and concluded by saying, \"there is but\r\none word, Mr. President, in the paper which I disapprove, and that is\r\nthe word _Congress;_\" on which Ben Harrison rose and said, \"There is\r\nbut one word in the paper, Mr. President, of which I approve, and that\r\nis the word _Congress_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of July, Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams, R. H. Lee, and myself,\r\nwere appointed a committee to consider and report on Lord North's\r\nconciliatory resolution. The answer of the Virginia Assembly on that\r\nsubject having been approved, I was requested by the committee to\r\nprepare this report, which will account for the similarity of feature\r\nin the two instruments.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May, 1776, the convention of Virginia instructed their\r\ndelegates in Congress, to propose to that body to declare the colonies\r\nindependent of Great Britain, and appointed a committee to prepare a\r\ndeclaration of rights and plan of government.\r\n\r\n[8]In Congress, Friday, June 7, 1776. The delegates from Virginia\r\nmoved, in obedience to instructions from their constituents, that the\r\nCongress should declare that these United colonies are, and of right\r\nought to be, free and independent states, that they are absolved\r\nfrom all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political\r\nconnection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought\r\nto be, totally dissolved; that measures should be immediately taken\r\nfor procuring the assistance of foreign powers, and a Confederation be\r\nformed to bind the colonies more closely together.\r\n\r\nThe House being obliged to attend at that time to some other business,\r\nthe proposition was referred to the next day, when the members were\r\nordered to attend punctually at ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nSaturday, June 8. They proceeded to take it into consideration, and\r\nreferred it to a committee of the whole, into which they immediately\r\nresolved themselves, and passed that day and Monday, the 10th, in\r\ndebating on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt was argued by Wilson, Robert R. Livingston, E. Rutledge, Dickinson,\r\nand others--\r\n\r\nThat, though they were friends to the measures themselves, and saw the\r\nimpossibility that we should ever again be united with Great Britain,\r\nyet they were against adopting them at this time:\r\n\r\nThat the conduct we had formerly observed was wise and proper now, of\r\ndeferring to take any capital step till the voice of the people drove\r\nus into it:\r\n\r\nThat they were our power, and without them our declarations could not\r\nbe carried into effect:\r\n\r\nThat the people of the middle colonies (Maryland, Delaware,\r\nPennsylvania, the Jerseys and New York) were not yet ripe for bidding\r\nadieu to British connection, but that they were fast ripening, and, in\r\na short time, would join in the general voice of America:\r\n\r\nThat the resolution, entered into by this House on the 15th of May,\r\nfor suppressing the exercise of all powers derived from the crown, had\r\nshown, by the ferment into which it had thrown these middle colonies,\r\nthat they had not yet accommodated their minds to a separation from the\r\nmother country:\r\n\r\nThat some of them had expressly forbidden their delegates to consent\r\nto such a declaration, and others had given no instructions, and\r\nconsequently no powers to give such consent:\r\n\r\nThat if the delegates of any particular colony had no power to declare\r\nsuch colony independent, certain they were, the others could not\r\ndeclare it for them; the colonies being as yet perfectly independent of\r\neach other:\r\n\r\nThat the assembly of Pennsylvania was now sitting above stairs, their\r\nconvention would sit within a few days, the convention of New York was\r\nnow sitting, and those of the Jerseys and Delaware counties would meet\r\non the Monday following, and it was probable these bodies would take up\r\nthe question of Independence, and would declare to their delegates the\r\nvoice of their state:\r\n\r\nThat if such a declaration should now be agreed to, these delegates\r\nmust retire, and possibly their colonies might secede from the Union:\r\n\r\nThat such a secession would weaken us more than could be compensated by\r\nany foreign alliance:\r\n\r\nThat in the event of such a division, foreign powers would either\r\nrefuse to join themselves to our fortunes, or, having us so much in\r\ntheir power as that desperate declaration would place us, they would\r\ninsist on terms proportionably more hard and prejudicial:\r\n\r\nThat we had little reason to expect an alliance with those to whom\r\nalone, as yet, we had cast our eyes:\r\n\r\nThat France and Spain had reason to be jealous of that rising power,\r\nwhich would one day certainly strip them of all their American\r\npossessions:\r\n\r\nThat it was more likely they should form a connection with the\r\nBritish court, who, if they should find themselves unable otherwise\r\nto extricate themselves from their difficulties, would agree to a\r\npartition of our territories, restoring Canada to France, and the\r\nFloridas to Spain, to accomplish for themselves a recovery of these\r\ncolonies:\r\n\r\nThat it would not be long before we should receive certain information\r\nof the disposition of the French court, from the agent whom we had sent\r\nto Paris for that purpose:\r\n\r\nThat if this disposition should be favorable, by waiting the event of\r\nthe present campaign, which we all hoped would be successful, we should\r\nhave reason to expect an alliance on better terms:\r\n\r\nThat this would in fact work no delay of any effectual aid from such\r\nally, as, from the advance of the season and distance of our situation,\r\nit was impossible we could receive any assistance during this campaign:\r\n\r\nThat it was prudent to fix among ourselves the terms on which we should\r\nform alliance, before we declared we would form one at all events:\r\n\r\nAnd that if these were agreed on, and our Declaration of Independence\r\nready by the time our Ambassador should be prepared to sail, it would\r\nbe as well as to go into that Declaration at this day.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, it was urged by J. Adams, Lee, Wythe, and others,\r\nthat no gentleman had argued against the policy or the right of\r\nseparation from Britain, nor had supposed it possible we should\r\never renew our connection; that they had only opposed its being now\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\nThat the question was not whether, by a Declaration of Independence, we\r\nshould make ourselves what we are not; but whether we should declare a\r\nfact which already exists:\r\n\r\nThat, as to the people or parliament of England, we had always been\r\nindependent of them, their restraints on our trade deriving efficacy\r\nfrom our acquiescence only, and not from any rights they possessed of\r\nimposing them, and that so far, our connection had been federal only,\r\nand was now dissolved by the commencement of hostilities:\r\n\r\nThat, as to the King, we had been bound to him by allegiance, but\r\nthat this bond was now dissolved by his assent to the last act of\r\nParliament, by which he declares us out of his protection, and by\r\nhis levying war on us, a fact which had long ago proved us out of his\r\nprotection; it being a certain position in law, that allegiance and\r\nprotection are reciprocal, the one ceasing when the other is withdrawn:\r\n\r\nThat James the II. never declared the people of England out of his\r\nprotection, yet his actions proved it, and the Parliament declared it:\r\n\r\nNo delegates then can be denied, or ever want, a power of declaring an\r\nexisting truth:\r\n\r\nThat the delegates from the Delaware counties having declared their\r\nconstituents ready to join, there are only two colonies, Pennsylvania\r\nand Maryland, whose delegates are absolutely tied up, and that these\r\nhad, by their instructions, only reserved a right of confirming or\r\nrejecting the measure:\r\n\r\nThat the instructions from Pennsylvania might be accounted for from the\r\ntimes in which they were drawn, near a twelvemonth ago, since which the\r\nface of affairs has totally changed:\r\n\r\nThat within that time, it had become apparent that Britain was\r\ndetermined to accept nothing less than a _carte-blanche_, and that the\r\nKing's answer to the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council of London,\r\nwhich had come to hand four days ago, must have satisfied every one of\r\nthis point:\r\n\r\nThat the people wait for us to lead the way:\r\n\r\nThat _they_ are in favor of the measure, though the instructions given\r\nby some of their _representatives_ are not:\r\n\r\nThat the voice of the representatives is not always consonant with\r\nthe voice of the people, and that this is remarkably the case in these\r\nmiddle colonies:\r\n\r\nThat the effect of the resolution of the 15th of May has proved this,\r\nwhich, raising the murmurs of some in the colonies of Pennsylvania\r\nand Maryland, called forth the opposing voice of the freer part of the\r\npeople, and proved them to be the majority even in these colonies:\r\n\r\nThat the backwardness of these two colonies might be ascribed, partly\r\nto the influence of proprietary power and connections, and partly, to\r\ntheir having not yet been attacked by the enemy:\r\n\r\nThat these causes were not likely to be soon removed, as there seemed\r\nno probability that the enemy would make either of these the seat of\r\nthis summer's war:\r\n\r\nThat it would be vain to wait either weeks or months for perfect\r\nunanimity, since it was impossible that all men should ever become of\r\none sentiment on any question:\r\n\r\nThat the conduct of some colonies, from the beginning of this contest,\r\nhad given reason to suspect it was their settled policy to keep in\r\nthe rear of the confederacy, that their particular prospect might be\r\nbetter, even in the worst event:\r\n\r\nThat, therefore, it was necessary for those colonies who had thrown\r\nthemselves forward and hazarded all from the beginning, to come forward\r\nnow also, and put all again to their own hazard:\r\n\r\nThat the history of the Dutch Revolution, of whom three states only\r\nconfederated at first, proved that a secession of some colonies would\r\nnot be so dangerous as some apprehended:\r\n\r\nThat a declaration of Independence alone could render it consistent\r\nwith European delicacy, for European powers to treat with us, or even\r\nto receive an Ambassador from us:\r\n\r\nThat till this, they would not receive our vessels into their ports,\r\nnor acknowledge the adjudications of our courts of admirality to be\r\nlegitimate, in cases of capture of British vessels:\r\n\r\nThat though France and Spain may be jealous of our rising power,\r\nthey must think it will be much more formidable with the addition of\r\nGreat Britain; and will therefore see it their interest to prevent\r\na coalition; but should they refuse, we shall be but where we are;\r\nwhereas without trying, we shall never know whether they will aid us or\r\nnot:\r\n\r\nThat the present campaign may be unsuccessful, and therefore we had\r\nbetter propose an alliance while our affairs wear a hopeful aspect:\r\n\r\nThat to wait the event of this campaign will certainly work delay,\r\nbecause, during the summer, France may assist us effectually, by\r\ncutting off those supplies of provisions from England and Ireland, on\r\nwhich the enemy's armies here are to depend; or by setting in motion\r\nthe great power they have collected in the West Indies, and calling our\r\nenemy to the defence of the possessions they have there:\r\n\r\nThat it would be idle to lose time in settling the terms of alliance,\r\ntill we had first determined we would enter into alliance:\r\n\r\nThat it is necessary to lose no time in opening a trade for our people,\r\nwho will want clothes, and will want money too, for the payment of\r\ntaxes:\r\n\r\nAnd that the only misfortune is, that we did not enter into alliance\r\nwith France six months sooner, as, besides opening her ports for the\r\nvent of our last year's produce, she might have marched an army into\r\nGermany, and prevented the petty princes there, from selling their\r\nunhappy subjects to subdue us.\r\n\r\nIt appearing in the course of these debates, that the colonies of New\r\nYork, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South Carolina\r\nwere not yet matured for falling from the parent stem, but that they\r\nwere fast advancing to that state, it was thought most prudent to wait\r\na while for them, and to postpone the final decision to July 1st; but,\r\nthat this might occasion as little delay as possible, a committee was\r\nappointed to prepare a Declaration of Independence. The committee were\r\nJohn Adams, Dr. Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert R. Livingston, and\r\nmyself. Committees were also appointed, at the same time, to prepare a\r\nplan of confederation for the colonies, and to state the terms proper\r\nto be proposed for foreign alliance. The committee for drawing the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, desired me to do it. It was accordingly\r\ndone, and being approved by them, I reported it to the House on Friday,\r\nthe 28th of June, when it was read, and ordered to lie on the table.\r\nOn Monday, the 1st of July, the House resolved itself into a committee\r\nof the whole, and resumed the consideration of the original motion\r\nmade by the delegates of Virginia, which, being again debated through\r\nthe day, was carried in the affirmative by the votes of New Hampshire,\r\nConnecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina and Georgia. South Carolina and Pennsylvania\r\nvoted against it. Delaware had but two members present, and they\r\nwere divided. The delegates from New York declared they were for it\r\nthemselves, and were assured their constituents were for it; but that\r\ntheir instructions having been drawn near a twelvemonth before, when\r\nreconciliation was still the general object, they were enjoined by them\r\nto do nothing which should impede that object. They, therefore, thought\r\nthemselves not justifiable in voting on either side, and asked leave to\r\nwithdraw from the question; which was given them. The committee rose\r\nand reported their resolution to the House. Mr. Edward Rutledge, of\r\nSouth Carolina, then requested the determination might be put off to\r\nthe next day, as he believed his colleagues, though they disapproved\r\nof the resolution, would then join in it for the sake of unanimity.\r\nThe ultimate question, whether the House would agree to the resolution\r\nof the committee, was accordingly postponed to the next day, when it\r\nwas again moved, and South Carolina concurred in voting for it. In the\r\nmeantime, a third member had come post from the Delaware counties, and\r\nturned the vote of that colony in favor of the resolution. Members of a\r\ndifferent sentiment attending that morning from Pennsylvania also, her\r\nvote was changed, so that the whole twelve colonies who were authorized\r\nto vote at all, gave their voices for it; and, within a few days,[9]\r\nthe convention of New York approved of it, and thus supplied the void\r\noccasioned by the withdrawing of her delegates from the vote.\r\n\r\nCongress proceeded the same day to consider the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, which had been reported and lain on the table the Friday\r\npreceding, and on Monday referred to a committee of the whole. The\r\npusillanimous idea that we had friends in England worth keeping terms\r\nwith, still haunted the minds of many. For this reason, those passages\r\nwhich conveyed censures on the people of England were struck out,\r\nlest they should give them offence. The clause too, reprobating the\r\nenslaving the inhabitants of Africa, was struck out in complaisance\r\nto South Carolina and Georgia, who had never attempted to restrain\r\nthe importation of slaves, and who, on the contrary, still wished to\r\ncontinue it. Our northern brethren also, I believe, felt a little\r\ntender under those censures; for though their people had very few\r\nslaves themselves, yet they had been pretty considerable carriers\r\nof them to others. The debates, having taken up the greater parts of\r\nthe 2d, 3d, and 4th days of July, were, on the evening of the last,\r\nclosed; the Declaration was reported by the committee, agreed to by\r\nthe House, and signed by every member present, except Mr. Dickinson.\r\nAs the sentiments of men are known not only by what they receive,\r\nbut what they reject also, I will state the form of the Declaration\r\nas originally reported. The parts struck out by Congress shall be\r\ndistinguished by a black line drawn under them[10] and those inserted\r\nby them shall be placed in the margin, or in a concurrent column.\r\n\r\n\r\n      A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of\r\n               America, in _General_ Congress assembled.\r\n\r\n                         When, in the course of human events,\r\n                         it becomes necessary for one people\r\n                         to dissolve the political bands which\r\n                         have connected them with another, and\r\n                         to assume among the powers of the earth\r\n                         the separate and equal station to which\r\n                         the laws of nature and of nature's God\r\n                         entitle them, a decent respect to the\r\n                         opinions of mankind requires that they\r\n                         should declare the causes which impel\r\n                         them to the separation.\r\n\r\n                         We hold these truths to be self evident:\r\n                         that all men are created equal; that they\r\n                         are endowed by their creator with\r\n  [certain]              [_inherent and_] inalienable rights; that\r\n                         among these are life, liberty, and the\r\n                         pursuit of happiness; that to secure\r\n                         these rights, governments are instituted\r\n                         among men, deriving their just powers\r\n                         from the consent of the governed;\r\n                         that whenever any form of government\r\n                         becomes destructive of these ends, it\r\n                         is the right of the people to alter\r\n                         or to abolish it, and to institute new\r\n                         government, laying its foundation on such\r\n                         principles, and organizing its powers\r\n                         in such form, as to them shall seem\r\n                         most likely to effect their safety and\r\n                         happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate\r\n                         that governments long established should\r\n                         not be changed for light and transient\r\n                         causes; and accordingly all experience\r\n                         hath shown that mankind are more disposed\r\n                         to suffer while evils are sufferable,\r\n                         than to right themselves by abolishing\r\n                         the forms to which they are accustomed.\r\n                         But when a long train of abuses and\r\n                         usurpations, [_begun at a distinguished\r\n                         period and_] pursuing invariably the\r\n                         same object, evinces a design to reduce\r\n                         them under absolute despotism, it is\r\n                         their right, it is their duty to throw\r\n                         off such government, and to provide new\r\n                         guards for their future security. Such\r\n                         has been the patient sufferance of these\r\n                         colonies; and such is now the necessity\r\n  [alter]                which constrains them to [_expunge_]\r\n                         their former systems of government. The\r\n                         history of the present king of Great Britain\r\n  [repeated]             is a history of [_unremitting_] injuries\r\n  [all having]           injuries and usurpations, [_among_ which\r\n                         appears no solitary fact to contradict\r\n                         the uniform tenor of the rest, but all\r\n                         have_] in direct object the establishment of\r\n                         an absolute tyranny over these states.

We have reminded\r\n                         them of the circumstances of our\r\n                         emigration and settlement here, [_no\r\n                         one of which could warrant so strange\r\n                         a pretension: that these were effected\r\n                         at the expense of our own blood and\r\n                         treasure, unassisted by the wealth or\r\n                         the strength of Great Britain: that in\r\n                         constituting indeed, our several forms\r\n                         of government, we had adopted one common\r\n                         king, thereby laying a foundation for\r\n                         perpetual league and amity with them: but\r\n                         that submission to their parliament was\r\n                         no part of our constitution, nor ever in\r\n                         idea, if history may be credited: and_,]\r\n  [have]                 we [ ] appealed to their native justice and\r\n  [and we have           magnanimity [_as well as to_] the ties of our\r\n  conjured them by]      common kindred to disavow these usurpations\r\n  [would inevitably]     which [_were likely to_] interrupt our\r\n                         connection and correspondence. They\r\n                         too have been deaf to the voice of\r\n                         justice and of consanguinity, [_and\r\n                         when occasions have been given them,\r\n                         by the regular course of their laws,\r\n                         of removing from their councils the\r\n                         disturbers of our harmony, they have, by\r\n                         their free election, re-established them\r\n                         in power.

Wells asked explanations of me, which are given in my letter to him\r\nof May 12, '19, before and now again referred to.[11] I took notes in\r\nmy place while these things were going on, and at their close wrote\r\nthem out in form and with correctness, and from 1 to 7 of the two\r\npreceding sheets, are the originals then written; as the two following\r\nare of the earlier debates on the Confederation, which I took in like\r\nmanner.[12]]\r\n\r\nOn Friday, July 12, the committee appointed to draw the articles\r\nof Confederation reported them, and, on the 22d, the House resolved\r\nthemselves into a committee to take them into consideration. On the\r\n30th and 31st of that month, and 1st of the ensuing, those articles\r\nwere debated which determined the proportion, or quota, of money which\r\neach state should furnish to the common treasury, and the manner of\r\nvoting in Congress. The first of these articles was expressed in the\r\noriginal draught in these words. \"Art. XI. All charges of war and\r\nall other expenses that shall be incurred for the common defence, or\r\ngeneral welfare, and allowed by the United States assembled, shall\r\nbe defrayed out of a common treasury, which shall be supplied by the\r\nseveral colonies in proportion to the number of inhabitants of every\r\nage, sex, and quality, except Indians not paying taxes, in each colony,\r\na true account of which, distinguishing the white inhabitants, shall\r\nbe triennially taken and transmitted to the Assembly of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chase moved that the quotas should be fixed, not by the number of\r\ninhabitants of every condition, but by that of the \"white inhabitants.\"\r\nHe admitted that taxation should be always in proportion to property,\r\nthat this was, in theory, the true rule; but that, from a variety of\r\ndifficulties, it was a rule which could never be adopted in practice.\r\nThe value of the property in every State, could never be estimated\r\njustly and equally. Some other measure for the wealth of the State\r\nmust therefore be devised, some standard referred to, which would be\r\nmore simple. He considered the number of inhabitants as a tolerably\r\ngood criterion of property, and that this might always be obtained.\r\nHe therefore thought it the best mode which we could adopt, with one\r\nexception only: he observed that negroes are property, and as such,\r\ncannot be distinguished from the lands or personalities held in those\r\nStates where there are few slaves; that the surplus of profit which\r\na Northern farmer is able to lay by, he invests in cattle, horses,\r\n&c., whereas a Southern farmer lays out the same surplus in slaves.\r\nThere is no more reason, therefore, for taxing the Southern States on\r\nthe farmer's head, and on his slave's head, than the Northern ones on\r\ntheir farmer's heads and the heads of their cattle; that the method\r\nproposed would, therefore, tax the Southern States according to their\r\nnumbers and their wealth conjunctly, while the Northern would be taxed\r\non numbers only: that negroes, in fact, should not be considered as\r\nmembers of the State, more than cattle, and that they have no more\r\ninterest in it.\r\n\r\nMr. John Adams observed, that the numbers of people were taken by this\r\narticle, as an index of the wealth of the State, and not as subjects\r\nof taxation; that, as to this matter, it was of no consequence by\r\nwhat name you called your people, whether by that of freemen or of\r\nslaves; that in some countries the laboring poor were called freemen,\r\nin others they were called slaves; but that the difference as to the\r\nstate was imaginary only. What matters it whether a landlord, employing\r\nten laborers on his farm, gives them annually as much money as will\r\nbuy them the necessaries of life, or gives them those necessaries at\r\nshort hand? The ten laborers add as much wealth annually to the State,\r\nincrease its exports as much in the one case as the other. Certainly\r\nfive hundred freemen produce no more profits, no greater surplus for\r\nthe payment of taxes, than five hundred slaves. Therefore, the State\r\nin which are the laborers called freemen, should be taxed no more than\r\nthat in which are those called slaves. Suppose, by an extraordinary\r\noperation of nature or of law, one half the laborers of a State\r\ncould in the course of one night be transformed into slaves; would\r\nthe State be made the poorer or the less able to pay taxes? That the\r\ncondition of the laboring poor in most countries, that of the fishermen\r\nparticularly of the Northern States, is as abject as that of slaves.\r\nIt is the number of laborers which produces the surplus for taxation,\r\nand numbers, therefore, indiscriminately, are the fair index of wealth;\r\nthat it is the use of the word \"property\" here, and its application\r\nto some of the people of the State, which produces the fallacy. How\r\ndoes the Southern farmer procure slaves? Either by importation or by\r\npurchase from his neighbor. If he imports a slave, he adds one to the\r\nnumber of laborers in his country, and proportionably to its profits\r\nand abilities to pay taxes; if he buys from his neighbor, it is only a\r\ntransfer of a laborer from one farm to another, which does not change\r\nthe annual produce of the State, and therefore, should not change its\r\ntax: that if a Northern farmer works ten laborers on his farm, he can,\r\nit is true, invest the surplus of ten men's labor in cattle; but so may\r\nthe Southern farmer, working ten slaves; that a State of one hundred\r\nthousand freemen can maintain no more cattle, than one of one hundred\r\nthousand slaves. Therefore, they have no more of that kind of property;\r\nthat a slave may indeed, from the custom of speech, be more properly\r\ncalled the wealth of his master, than the free laborer might be called\r\nthe wealth of his employer; but as to the State, both were equally its\r\nwealth, and should, therefore, equally add to the quota of its tax.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison proposed, as a compromise, that two slaves should be\r\ncounted as one freeman. He affirmed that slaves did not do as much work\r\nas freemen, and doubted if two effected more than one; that this was\r\nproved by the price of labor; the hire of a laborer in the Southern\r\ncolonies being from 8 to £12, while in the Northern it was generally\r\n£24.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson said, that if this amendment should take place, the Southern\r\ncolonies would have all the benefit of slaves, whilst the Northern ones\r\nwould bear the burthen: that slaves increase the profits of a State,\r\nwhich the Southern States mean to take to themselves; that they also\r\nincrease the burthen of defence, which would of course fall so much\r\nthe heavier on the Northern: that slaves occupy the places of freemen,\r\nand eat their food. Dismiss your slaves, and freemen will take their\r\nplaces. It is our duty to lay every discouragement on the importation\r\nof slaves; but this amendment would give the _jus trium liberorum_\r\nto him who would import slaves: that other kinds of property were\r\npretty equally distributed through all the colonies: there were as\r\nmany cattle, horses and sheep, in the North as the South, and South\r\nas the North; but not so as to slaves: that experience has shown that\r\nthose colonies have been always able to pay most, which have the most\r\ninhabitants, whether they be black or white; and the practice of the\r\nSouthern colonies has always been to make every farmer pay poll taxes\r\nupon all his laborers, whether they be black or white. He acknowledges,\r\nindeed, that freemen work the most; but they consume the most also.\r\nThey do not produce a greater surplus for taxation. The slave is\r\nneither fed nor clothed so expensively as a freeman. Again, white women\r\nare exempted from labor generally, but negro women are not. In this,\r\nthen, the Southern States have an advantage as the article now stands.\r\nIt has sometimes been said, that slavery is necessary, because the\r\ncommodities they raise would be too dear for market if cultivated by\r\nfreemen; but now it is said that the labor of the slave is the dearest.\r\n\r\nMr. Payne urged the original resolution of Congress, to proportion the\r\nquotas of the States to the number of souls.\r\n\r\nDr. Witherspoon was of opinion, that the value of lands and houses\r\nwas the best estimate of the wealth of a nation, and that it was\r\npracticable to obtain such a valuation. This is the true barometer\r\nof wealth. The one now proposed is imperfect in itself, and unequal\r\nbetween the States. It has been objected that negroes eat the food of\r\nfreemen, and, therefore, should be taxed; horses also eat the food of\r\nfreemen; therefore they also should be taxed. It has been said too,\r\nthat in carrying slaves into the estimate of the taxes the State is to\r\npay, we do no more than those States themselves do, who always take\r\nslaves into the estimate of the taxes the individual is to pay. But\r\nthe cases are not parallel. In the Southern colonies slaves pervade the\r\nwhole colony; but they do not pervade the whole continent. That as to\r\nthe original resolution of Congress, to proportion the quotas according\r\nto the souls, it was temporary only, and related to the moneys\r\nheretofore emitted: whereas we are now entering into a new compact, and\r\ntherefore stand on original ground.\r\n\r\nAugust 1. The question being put, the amendment proposed was\r\nrejected by the votes of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, against those of\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina. Georgia was\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nThe other article was in these words. \"Art. XVII. In determining\r\nquestions, each colony shall have one vote.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 30, 31, August 1. Present forty-one members. Mr. Chase observed\r\nthis article was the most likely to divide us, of any one proposed\r\nin the draught then under consideration: that the larger colonies\r\nhad threatened they would not confederate at all, if their weight in\r\nCongress should not be equal to the numbers of people they added to the\r\nconfederacy; while the smaller ones declared against a union, if they\r\ndid not retain an equal vote for the protection of their rights. That\r\nit was of the utmost consequence to bring the parties together, as,\r\nshould we sever from each other, either no foreign power will ally with\r\nus at all, or the different States will form different alliances, and\r\nthus increase the horrors of those scenes of civil war and bloodshed,\r\nwhich in such a state of separation and independence, would render\r\nus a miserable people. That our importance, our interests, our peace\r\nrequired that we should confederate, and that mutual sacrifices should\r\nbe made to effect a compromise of this difficult question. He was of\r\nopinion, the smaller colonies would lose their rights, if they were\r\nnot in some instances allowed an equal vote; and, therefore, that a\r\ndiscrimination should take place among the questions which would come\r\nbefore Congress. That the smaller States should be secured in all\r\nquestions concerning life or liberty, and the greater ones, in all\r\nrespecting property. He, therefore, proposed, that in votes relating to\r\nmoney, the voice of each colony should be proportioned to the number of\r\nits inhabitants.\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin thought, that the votes should be so proportioned in\r\nall cases. He took notice that the Delaware counties had bound up\r\ntheir delegates to disagree to this article. He thought it a very\r\nextraordinary language to be held by any State, that they would not\r\nconfederate with us, unless we would let them dispose of our money.\r\nCertainly, if we vote equally, we ought to pay equally; but the smaller\r\nStates will hardly purchase the privilege at this price. That had\r\nhe lived in a State where the representation, originally equal, had\r\nbecome unequal by time and accident, he might have submitted rather\r\nthan disturb government; but that we should be very wrong to set out\r\nin this practice, when it is in our power to establish what is right.\r\nThat at the time of the Union between England and Scotland, the latter\r\nhad made the objection which the smaller States now do; but experience\r\nhad proved that no unfairness had ever been shown them: that their\r\nadvocates had prognosticated that it would again happen, as in times of\r\nold, that the whale would swallow Jonas, but he thought the prediction\r\nreversed in event, and that Jonas had swallowed the whale; for the\r\nScotch had in fact got possession of the government, and gave laws\r\nto the English. He reprobated the original agreement of Congress to\r\nvote by colonies, and, therefore, was for their voting, in all cases,\r\naccording to the number of taxables.\r\n\r\nDr. Witherspoon opposed every alteration of the article. All men\r\nadmit that a confederacy is necessary. Should the idea get abroad\r\nthat there is likely to be no union among us, it will damp the minds\r\nof the people, diminish the glory of our struggle, and lessen its\r\nimportance; because it will open to our view future prospects of\r\nwar and dissension among ourselves. If an equal vote be refused, the\r\nsmaller States will become vassals to the larger; and all experience\r\nhas shown that the vassals and subjects of free States are the most\r\nenslaved. He instanced the Helots of Sparta, and the provinces of\r\nRome. He observed that foreign powers, discovering this blemish, would\r\nmake it a handle for disengaging the smaller States from so unequal\r\na confederacy. That the colonies should in fact be considered as\r\nindividuals; and that, as such, in all disputes, they should have an\r\nequal vote; that they are now collected as individuals making a bargain\r\nwith each other, and, of course, had a right to vote as individuals.\r\nThat in the East India Company they voted by persons, and not by their\r\nproportion of stock. That the Belgic confederacy voted by provinces.\r\nThat in questions of war the smaller States were as much interested\r\nas the larger, and therefore, should vote equally; and indeed, that\r\nthe larger States were more likely to bring war on the confederacy,\r\nin proportion as their frontier was more extensive. He admitted that\r\nequality of representation was an excellent principle, but then it\r\nmust be of things which are co-ordinate; that is, of things similar,\r\nand of the same nature: that nothing relating to individuals could\r\never come before Congress; nothing but what would respect colonies.\r\nHe distinguished between an incorporating and a federal union. The\r\nunion of England was an incorporating one; yet Scotland had suffered\r\nby that union; for that its inhabitants were drawn from it by the\r\nhopes of places and employments: nor was it an instance of equality of\r\nrepresentation; because, while Scotland was allowed nearly a thirteenth\r\nof representation, they were to pay only one fortieth of the land tax.\r\nHe expressed his hopes, that in the present enlightened state of men's\r\nminds, we might expect a lasting confederacy, if it was founded on fair\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams advocated the voting in proportion to numbers. He said that\r\nwe stand here as the representatives of the people: that in some States\r\nthe people are many, in others they are few; that therefore, their\r\nvote here should be proportioned to the numbers from whom it comes.\r\nReason, justice and equity never had weight enough on the face of the\r\nearth, to govern the councils of men. It is interest alone which does\r\nit, and it is interest alone which can be trusted: that therefore the\r\ninterests within doors, should be the mathematical representatives of\r\nthe interests without doors: that the individuality of the colonies is\r\na mere sound. Does the individuality of a colony increase its wealth\r\nor numbers? If it does, pay equally. If it does not add weight in the\r\nscale of the confederacy, it cannot add to their rights, nor weigh\r\nin argument. A. has £50, B. £500, C. £1000 in partnership. Is it just\r\nthey should equally dispose of the moneys of the partnership? It has\r\nbeen said, we are independent individuals making a bargain together.\r\nThe question is not what we are now, but what we ought to be when our\r\nbargain shall be made. The confederacy is to make us one individual\r\nonly; it is to form us like separate parcels of metal, into one common\r\nmass. We shall no longer retain our separate individuality, but become\r\na single individual as to all questions submitted to the confederacy.\r\nTherefore, all those reasons, which prove the justice and expediency of\r\nequal representation in other assemblies, hold good here. It has been\r\nobjected that a proportional vote will endanger the smaller States.\r\nWe answer that an equal vote will endanger the larger. Virginia,\r\nPennsylvania, and Massachusetts, are the three greater colonies.\r\nConsider their distance, their difference of produce, of interests,\r\nand of manners, and it is apparent they can never have an interest\r\nor inclination to combine for the oppression of the smaller: that the\r\nsmaller will naturally divide on all questions with the larger. Rhode\r\nIsland, from its relation, similarity and intercourse, will generally\r\npursue the same objects with Massachusetts; Jersey, Delaware, and\r\nMaryland, with Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nDr. Rush took notice, that the decay of the liberties of the Dutch\r\nrepublic proceeded from three causes. 1. The perfect unanimity\r\nrequisite on all occasions. 2. Their obligation to consult their\r\nconstituents. 3. Their voting by provinces. This last destroyed the\r\nequality of representation, and the liberties of Great Britain also are\r\nsinking from the same defect. That a part of our rights is deposited in\r\nthe hands of our legislatures. There, it was admitted, there should be\r\nan equality of representation. Another part of our rights is deposited\r\nin the hands of Congress: why is it not equally necessary there should\r\nbe an equal representation there? Were it possible to collect the\r\nwhole body of the people together, they would determine the questions\r\nsubmitted to them by their majority. Why should not the same majority\r\ndecide when voting here, by their representatives? The larger colonies\r\nare so providentially divided in situation, as to render every fear\r\nof their combining visionary. Their interests are different, and their\r\ncircumstances dissimilar. It is more probable they will become rivals,\r\nand leave it in the power of the smaller States to give preponderance\r\nto any scale they please. The voting by the number of free inhabitants,\r\nwill have one excellent effect, that of inducing the colonies to\r\ndiscourage slavery, and to encourage the increase of their free\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins observed, there were four larger, four smaller, and\r\nfour middle-sized colonies. That the four largest would contain more\r\nthan half the inhabitants of the confederated States, and therefore,\r\nwould govern the others as they should please. That history affords\r\nno instance of such a thing as equal representation. The Germanic\r\nbody votes by States. The Helvetic body does the same; and so does\r\nthe Belgic confederacy. That too little is known of the ancient\r\nconfederations, to say what was their practice.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson thought, that taxation should be in proportion to wealth,\r\nbut that representation should accord with the number of freemen. That\r\ngovernment is a collection or result of the wills of all: that if any\r\ngovernment could speak the will of all, it would be perfect; and that,\r\nso far as it departs from this, it becomes imperfect. It has been said\r\nthat Congress is a representation of States, not of individuals. I say,\r\nthat the objects of its care are all the individuals of the States.\r\nIt is strange that annexing the name of \"State\" to ten thousand men,\r\nshould give them an equal right with forty thousand. This must be the\r\neffect of magic, not of reason. As to those matters which are referred\r\nto Congress, we are not so many States; we are one large State. We\r\nlay aside our individuality, whenever we come here. The Germanic\r\nbody is a burlesque on government; and their practice, on any point,\r\nis a sufficient authority and proof that it is wrong. The greatest\r\nimperfection in the constitution of the Belgic confederacy is their\r\nvoting by provinces. The interest of the whole is constantly sacrificed\r\nto that of the small States. The history of the war in the reign of\r\nQueen Anne sufficiently proves this. It is asked, shall nine colonies\r\nput it into the power of four to govern them as they please? I invert\r\nthe question, and ask, shall two millions of people put it in the power\r\nof one million to govern them as they please? It is pretended, too,\r\nthat the smaller colonies will be in danger from the greater. Speak\r\nin honest language and say, the minority will be in danger from the\r\nmajority. And is there an assembly on earth, where this danger may not\r\nbe equally pretended? The truth is, that our proceedings will then be\r\nconsentaneous with the interests of the majority, and so they ought\r\nto be. The probability is much greater, that the larger States will\r\ndisagree, than that they will combine. I defy the wit of man to invent\r\na possible case, or to suggest any one thing on earth, which shall\r\nbe for the interests of Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, and\r\nwhich will not also be for the interest of the other States.[13]\r\n\r\nThese articles, reported July 12, '76, were debated from day to day,\r\nand time to time, for two years, were ratified July 9, '78, by ten\r\nStates, by New Jersey on the 26th of November of the same year, and\r\nby Delaware on the 23d of February following. Maryland alone held off\r\ntwo years more, acceding to them March 1, '81, and thus closing the\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\nOur delegation had been renewed for the ensuing year, commencing\r\nAugust 11; but the new government was now organized, a meeting of the\r\nlegislature was to be held in October, and I had been elected a member\r\nby my county. I knew that our legislation, under the regal government,\r\nhad many very vicious points which urgently required reformation, and\r\nI thought I could be of more use in forwarding that work. I therefore\r\nretired from my seat in Congress on the 2d of September, resigned\r\nit, and took my place in the legislature of my State, on the 7th of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th, I moved for leave to bring in a bill for the establishment\r\nof courts of justice, the organization of which was of importance. I\r\ndrew the bill; it was approved by the committee, reported and passed,\r\nafter going through its due course.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, I obtained leave to bring in a bill declaring tenants in\r\ntail to hold their lands in fee simple. In the earlier times of the\r\ncolony, when lands were to be obtained for little or nothing, some\r\nprovident individuals procured large grants; and, desirous of founding\r\ngreat families for themselves, settled them on their descendants in fee\r\ntail. The transmission of this property from generation to generation,\r\nin the same name, raised up a distinct set of families, who, being\r\nprivileged by law in the perpetuation of their wealth, were thus formed\r\ninto a Patrician order, distinguished by the splendor and luxury\r\nof their establishments. From this order, too, the king habitually\r\nselected his counsellors of State; the hope of which distinction\r\ndevoted the whole corps to the interests and will of the crown. To\r\nannul this privilege, and instead of an aristocracy of wealth, of more\r\nharm and danger, than benefit, to society, to make an opening for the\r\naristocracy of virtue and talent, which nature has wisely provided for\r\nthe direction of the interests of society, and scattered with equal\r\nhand through all its conditions, was deemed essential to a well-ordered\r\nrepublic.--To effect it, no violence was necessary, no deprivation of\r\nnatural right, but rather an enlargement of it by a repeal of the law.\r\nFor this would authorize the present holder to divide the property\r\namong his children equally, as his affections were divided; and\r\nwould place them, by natural generation, on the level of their fellow\r\ncitizens. But this repeal was strongly opposed by Mr. Pendleton, who\r\nwas zealously attached to ancient establishments; and who, taken all\r\nin all, was the ablest man in debate I have ever met with. He had not\r\nindeed the poetical fancy of Mr. Henry, his sublime imagination, his\r\nlofty and overwhelming diction; but he was cool, smooth and persuasive;\r\nhis language flowing, chaste and embellished; his conceptions quick,\r\nacute and full of resource; never vanquished: for if he lost the main\r\nbattle, he returned upon you, and regained so much of it as to make it\r\na drawn one, by dexterous manœuvres, skirmishes in detail, and the\r\nrecovery of small advantages which, little singly, were important all\r\ntogether. You never knew when you were clear of him, but were harassed\r\nby his perseverance, until the patience was worn down of all who had\r\nless of it than himself. Add to this, that he was one of the most\r\nvirtuous and benevolent of men, the kindest friend, the most amiable\r\nand pleasant of companions, which ensured a favorable reception to\r\nwhatever came from him. Finding that the general principle of entails\r\ncould not be maintained, he took his stand on an amendment which he\r\nproposed, instead of an absolute abolition, to permit the tenant in\r\ntail to convey in fee simple, if he chose it; and he was within a few\r\nvotes of saving so much of the old law. But the bill passed finally for\r\nentire abolition.\r\n\r\nIn that one of the bills for organizing our judiciary system, which\r\nproposed a court of Chancery, I had provided for a trial by jury of all\r\nmatters of fact, in that as well as in the courts of law. He defeated\r\nit by the introduction of four words only, \"_if either party choose_.\"\r\nThe consequence has been, that as no suitor will say to his judge,\r\n\"Sir, I distrust you, give me a jury,\" juries are rarely, I might\r\nsay, perhaps, never, seen in that court, but when called for by the\r\nChancellor of his own accord.\r\n\r\nThe first establishment in Virginia which became permanent, was\r\nmade in 1607. I have found no mention of negroes in the colony until\r\nabout 1650. The first brought here as slaves were by a Dutch ship;\r\nafter which the English commenced the trade, and continued it until\r\nthe revolutionary war. That suspended, _ipso facto_, their further\r\nimportation for the present, and the business of the war pressing\r\nconstantly on the legislature, this subject was not acted on finally\r\nuntil the year '78, when I brought in a bill to prevent their further\r\nimportation. This passed without opposition, and stopped the increase\r\nof the evil by importation, leaving to future efforts its final\r\neradication.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers of this colony were Englishmen, loyal subjects to\r\ntheir king and church, and the grant to Sir Walter Raleigh contained\r\nan express proviso that their laws \"should not be against the true\r\nChristian faith, now professed in the church of England.\" As soon\r\nas the state of the colony admitted, it was divided into parishes,\r\nin each of which was established a minister of the Anglican church,\r\nendowed with a fixed salary, in tobacco, a glebe house and land\r\nwith the other necessary appendages. To meet these expenses, all the\r\ninhabitants of the parishes were assessed, whether they were or not,\r\nmembers of the established church. Towards Quakers who came here,\r\nthey were most cruelly intolerant, driving them from the colony by the\r\nseverest penalties. In process of time, however, other sectarisms were\r\nintroduced, chiefly of the Presbyterian family; and the established\r\nclergy, secure for life in their glebes and salaries, adding to these,\r\ngenerally, the emoluments of a classical school, found employment\r\nenough, in their farms and school-rooms, for the rest of the week, and\r\ndevoted Sunday only to the edification of their flock, by service, and\r\na sermon at their parish church. Their other pastoral functions were\r\nlittle attended to. Against this inactivity, the zeal and industry\r\nof sectarian preachers had an open and undisputed field; and by the\r\ntime of the revolution, a majority of the inhabitants had become\r\ndissenters from the established church, but were still obliged to pay\r\ncontributions to support the pastors of the minority. This unrighteous\r\ncompulsion, to maintain teachers of what they deemed religious errors,\r\nwas grievously felt during the regal government, and without a hope\r\nof relief. But the first republican legislature, which met in '76, was\r\ncrowded with petitions to abolish this spiritual tyranny. These brought\r\non the severest contests in which I have ever been engaged. Our great\r\nopponents were Mr. Pendleton and Robert Carter Nicholas; honest men,\r\nbut zealous churchmen. The petitions were referred to the committee\r\nof the whole house on the state of the country and, after desperate\r\ncontests in that committee, almost daily from the 11th of October to\r\nthe 5th of December, we prevailed so far only, as to repeal the laws\r\nwhich rendered criminal the maintenance of any religious opinions,\r\nthe forbearance of repairing to church, or the exercise of any mode\r\nof worship; and further, to exempt dissenters from contributions to\r\nthe support of the established church; and to suspend, only until the\r\nnext session, levies on the members of that church for the salaries\r\nof their own incumbents. For although the majority of our citizens\r\nwere dissenters, as has been observed, a majority of the legislature\r\nwere churchmen. Among these, however, were some reasonable and liberal\r\nmen, who enabled us, on some points, to obtain feeble majorities. But\r\nour opponents carried, in the general resolutions of the committee\r\nof November 19, a declaration that religious assemblies ought to be\r\nregulated, and that provision ought to be made for continuing the\r\nsuccession of the clergy, and superintending their conduct. And, in the\r\nbill now passed, was inserted an express reservation of the question,\r\nWhether a general assessment should not be established by law, on every\r\none, to the support of the pastor of his choice; or whether all should\r\nbe left to voluntary contributions; and on this question, debated at\r\nevery session, from '76 to '79, (some of our dissenting allies, having\r\nnow secured their particular object, going over to the advocates of a\r\ngeneral assessment,) we could only obtain a suspension from session to\r\nsession until '79, when the question against a general assessment was\r\nfinally carried, and the establishment of the Anglican church entirely\r\nput down. In justice to the two honest but zealous opponents who have\r\nbeen named, I must add, that although, from their natural temperaments,\r\nthey were more disposed generally to acquiesce in things as they\r\nare, than to risk innovations, yet whenever the public will had once\r\ndecided, none were more faithful or exact in their obedience to it.\r\n\r\nThe seat of our government had originally been fixed in the peninsula\r\nof Jamestown, the first settlement of the colonists; and had been\r\nafterwards removed a few miles inland to Williamsburg. But this was at\r\na time when our settlements had not extended beyond the tide waters.\r\nNow they had crossed the Alleghany; and the centre of population was\r\nvery far removed from what it had been. Yet Williamsburg was still the\r\ndepository of our archives, the habitual residence of the Governor and\r\nmany other of the public functionaries, the established place for the\r\nsessions of the legislature, and the magazine of our military stores;\r\nand its situation was so exposed that it might be taken at any time in\r\nwar, and, at this time particularly, an enemy might in the night run\r\nup either of the rivers, between which it lies, land a force above, and\r\ntake possession of the place, without the possibility of saving either\r\npersons or things. I had proposed its removal so early as October, '76;\r\nbut it did not prevail until the session of May, '79.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session of May, '79, I prepared, and obtained leave to\r\nbring in a bill, declaring who should be deemed citizens, asserting the\r\nnatural right of expatriation, and prescribing the mode of exercising\r\nit. This, when I withdrew from the house, on the 1st of June following,\r\nI left in the hands of George Mason, and it was passed on the 26th of\r\nthat month.\r\n\r\nIn giving this account of the laws of which I was myself the mover\r\nand draughtsman, I, by no means, mean to claim to myself the merit\r\nof obtaining their passage. I had many occasional and strenuous\r\ncoadjutors in debate, and one, most steadfast, able and zealous; who\r\nwas himself a host. This was George Mason, a man of the first order\r\nof wisdom among those who acted on the theatre of the revolution,\r\nof expansive mind, profound judgment, cogent in argument, learned in\r\nthe lore of our former constitution, and earnest for the republican\r\nchange on democratic principles. His elocution was neither flowing nor\r\nsmooth; but his language was strong, his manner most impressive, and\r\nstrengthened by a dash of biting cynicism, when provocation made it\r\nseasonable.\r\n\r\nMr. Wythe, while speaker in the two sessions of 1777, between his\r\nreturn from Congress and his appointment to the Chancery, was an able\r\nand constant associate in whatever was before a committee of the whole.\r\nHis pure integrity, judgment and reasoning powers, gave him great\r\nweight. Of him, see more in some notes inclosed in my letter of August\r\n31, 1821, to Mr. John Saunderson.[14]\r\n\r\nMr. Madison came into the House in 1776, a new member and young; which\r\ncircumstances, concurring with his extreme modesty, prevented his\r\nventuring himself in debate before his removal to the Council of State,\r\nin November, '77. From thence he went to Congress, then consisting\r\nof few members. Trained in these successive schools, he acquired\r\na habit of self-possession, which placed at ready command the rich\r\nresources of his luminous and discriminating mind, and of his extensive\r\ninformation, and rendered him the first of every assembly afterwards,\r\nof which he became a member. Never wandering from his subject into vain\r\ndeclamation, but pursuing it closely, in language pure, classical and\r\ncopious, soothing always the feelings of his adversaries by civilities\r\nand softness of expression, he rose to the eminent station which he\r\nheld in the great National Convention of 1787; and in that of Virginia\r\nwhich followed, he sustained the new constitution in all its parts,\r\nbearing off the palm against the logic of George Mason, and the fervid\r\ndeclamation of Mr. Henry. With these consummate powers, were united\r\na pure and spotless virtue which no calumny has ever attempted to\r\nsully. Of the powers and polish of his pen, and of the wisdom of his\r\nadministration in the highest office of the nation, I need say nothing.\r\nThey have spoken, and will forever speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nSo far we were proceeding in the details of reformation only; selecting\r\npoints of legislation, prominent in character and principle, urgent,\r\nand indicative of the strength of the general pulse of reformation.\r\nWhen I left Congress, in '76, it was in the persuasion that our whole\r\ncode must be reviewed, adapted to our republican form of government;\r\nand, now that we had no negatives of Councils, Governors, and Kings\r\nto restrain us from doing right, that it should be corrected, in all\r\nits parts, with a single eye to reason, and the good of those for\r\nwhose government it was framed. Early, therefore, in the session\r\nof '76, to which I returned, I moved and presented a bill for the\r\nrevision of the laws, which was passed on the 24th of October; and on\r\nthe 5th of November, Mr. Pendleton, Mr. Wythe, George Mason, Thomas\r\nL. Lee, and myself, were appointed a committee to execute the work.\r\nWe agreed to meet at Fredericksburg to settle the plan of operation,\r\nand to distribute the work. We met there accordingly, on the 13th\r\nof January, 1777. The first question was, whether we should propose\r\nto abolish the whole existing system of laws, and prepare a new and\r\ncomplete Institute, or preserve the general system, and only modify it\r\nto the present state of things. Mr. Pendleton, contrary to his usual\r\ndisposition in favor of ancient things, was for the former proposition,\r\nin which he was joined by Mr. Lee. To this it was objected, that to\r\nabrogate our whole system would be a bold measure, and probably far\r\nbeyond the views of the legislature; that they had been in the practice\r\nof revising, from time to time, the laws of the colony, omitting the\r\nexpired, the repealed, and the obsolete, amending only those retained,\r\nand probably meant we should now do the same, only including the\r\nBritish statutes as well as our own: that to compose a new Institute,\r\nlike those of Justinian and Bracton, or that of Blackstone, which was\r\nthe model proposed by Mr. Pendleton, would be an arduous undertaking,\r\nof vast research, of great consideration and judgment; and when reduced\r\nto a text, every word of that text, from the imperfection of human\r\nlanguage, and its incompetence to express distinctly every shade of\r\nidea, would become a subject of question and chicanery, until settled\r\nby repeated adjudications; and this would involve us for ages in\r\nlitigation and render property uncertain, until, like the statutes\r\nof old, every word had been tried and settled by numerous decisions,\r\nand by new volumes of reports and commentaries; and that no one of\r\nus, probably, would undertake such a work, which to be systematical,\r\nmust be the work of one hand. This last was the opinion of Mr. Wythe,\r\nMr. Mason, and myself. When we proceeded to the distribution of the\r\nwork, Mr. Mason excused himself, as, being no lawyer, he felt himself\r\nunqualified for the work, and he resigned soon after. Mr. Lee excused\r\nhimself on the same ground, and died, indeed, in a short time. The\r\nother two gentlemen, therefore, and myself divided the work among\r\nus. The common law and statutes to the 4 James I. (when our separate\r\nlegislature was established) were assigned to me; the British statutes,\r\nfrom that period to the present day, to Mr. Wythe; and the Virginia\r\nlaws to Mr. Pendleton. As the law of Descents, and the criminal law\r\nfell of course within my portion, I wished the committee to settle\r\nthe leading principles of these, as a guide for me in framing them;\r\nand, with respect to the first, I proposed to abolish the law of\r\nprimogeniture, and to make real estate descendible in parcenary to the\r\nnext of kin, as personal property is, by the statute of distribution.\r\nMr. Pendleton wished to preserve the right of primogeniture, but seeing\r\nat once that that could not prevail, he proposed we should adopt\r\nthe Hebrew principle, and give a double portion to the elder son. I\r\nobserved, that if the eldest son could eat twice as much, or do double\r\nwork, it might be a natural evidence of his right to a double portion;\r\nbut being on a par in his powers and wants, with his brothers and\r\nsisters, he should be on a par also in the partition of the patrimony;\r\nand such was the decision of the other members.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the Criminal law, all were agreed, that the\r\npunishment of death should be abolished, except for treason and murder;\r\nand that, for other felonies, should be substituted hard labor in the\r\npublic works, and in some cases, the _Lex talionis_. How this last\r\nrevolting principle came to obtain our approbation I do not remember.\r\nThere remained, indeed, in our laws, a vestige of it in a single case\r\nof a slave; it was the English law, in the time of the Anglo-Saxons,\r\ncopied probably from the Hebrew law of \"an eye for an eye, a tooth\r\nfor a tooth,\" and it was the law of several ancient people; but the\r\nmodern mind had left it far in the rear of its advances. These points,\r\nhowever, being settled, we repaired to our respective homes for the\r\npreparation of the work.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of my part, I thought it material not to vary the\r\ndiction of the ancient statutes by modernizing it, nor to give rise\r\nto new questions by new expressions. The text of these statutes had\r\nbeen so fully explained and defined, by numerous adjudications, as\r\nscarcely ever now to produce a question in our courts. I thought it\r\nwould be useful, also, in all new draughts, to reform the style of the\r\nlater British statutes, and of our own acts of Assembly; which, from\r\ntheir verbosity, their endless tautologies, their involutions of case\r\nwithin case, and parenthesis within parenthesis, and their multiplied\r\nefforts at certainty, by _saids_ and _aforesaids_, by _ors_ and by\r\n_ands_, to make them more plain, are really rendered more perplexed\r\nand incomprehensible, not only to common readers, but to the lawyers\r\nthemselves. We were employed in this work from that time to February,\r\n1779, when we met at Williamsburg, that is to say, Mr. Pendleton, Mr.\r\nWythe and myself; and meeting day by day, we examined critically our\r\nseveral parts, sentence by sentence, scrutinizing and amending, until\r\nwe had agreed on the whole. We then returned home, had fair copies made\r\nof our several parts, which were reported to the General Assembly,\r\nJune 18, 1779, by Mr. Wythe and myself, Mr. Pendleton's residence\r\nbeing distant, and he having authorized us by letter to declare his\r\napprobation. We had, in this work, brought so much of the Common law\r\nas it was thought necessary to alter, all the British statutes from\r\n_Magna Charta_ to the present day, and all the laws of Virginia,\r\nfrom the establishment of our legislature, in the 4th Jac. 1. to the\r\npresent time, which we thought should be retained, within the compass\r\nof one hundred and twenty-six bills, making a printed folio of ninety\r\npages only. Some bills were taken out, occasionally, from time to\r\ntime, and passed; but the main body of the work was not entered on\r\nby the legislature until after the general peace, in 1785, when, by\r\nthe unwearied exertions of Mr. Madison, in opposition to the endless\r\nquibbles, chicaneries, perversions, vexations and delays of lawyers and\r\ndemi-lawyers, most of the bills were passed by the legislature, with\r\nlittle alteration.\r\n\r\nThe bill for establishing religious freedom, the principles of which\r\nhad, to a certain degree, been enacted before, I had drawn in all the\r\nlatitude of reason and right. It still met with opposition; but, with\r\nsome mutilations in the preamble, it was finally passed; and a singular\r\nproposition proved that its protection of opinion was meant to be\r\nuniversal. Where the preamble declares, that coercion is a departure\r\nfrom the plan of the holy author of our religion, an amendment was\r\nproposed, by inserting the word \"Jesus Christ,\" so that it should read,\r\n\"a departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our\r\nreligion;\" the insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof\r\nthat they meant to comprehend, within the mantle of its protection,\r\nthe Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and\r\nInfidel of every denomination.\r\n\r\nBeccaria, and other writers on crimes and punishments, had satisfied\r\nthe reasonable world of the unrightfulness and inefficacy of the\r\npunishment of crimes by death; and hard labor on roads, canals and\r\nother public works, had been suggested as a proper substitute. The\r\nRevisors had adopted these opinions; but the general idea of our\r\ncountry had not yet advanced to that point. The bill, therefore,\r\nfor proportioning crimes and punishments, was lost in the House of\r\nDelegates by a majority of a single vote. I learned afterwards, that\r\nthe substitute of hard labor in public, was tried (I believe it was\r\nin Pennsylvania) without success. Exhibited as a public spectacle,\r\nwith shaved heads and mean clothing, working on the high roads,\r\nproduced in the criminals such a prostration of character, such\r\nan abandonment of self-respect, as, instead of reforming, plunged\r\nthem into the most desperate and hardened depravity of morals and\r\ncharacter. To pursue the subject of this law.--I was written to in\r\n1785 (being then in Paris) by directors appointed to superintend the\r\nbuilding of a Capitol in Richmond, to advise them as to a plan, and\r\nto add to it one of a Prison. Thinking it a favorable opportunity\r\nof introducing into the State an example of architecture, in the\r\nclassic style of antiquity, and the Maison quarrée of Nismes, an\r\nancient Roman temple, being considered as the most perfect model\r\nexisting of what may be called Cubic architecture, I applied to M.\r\nClerissault, who had published drawings of the Antiquities of Nismes,\r\nto have me a model of the building made in stucco, only changing\r\nthe order from Corinthian to Ionic, on account of the difficulty of\r\nthe Corinthian capitals. I yielded, with reluctance, to the taste of\r\nClerissault, in his preference of the modern capital of Scamozzi to\r\nthe more noble capital of antiquity. This was executed by the artist\r\nwhom Choiseul Gouffier had carried with him to Constantinople, and\r\nemployed, while Ambassador there, in making those beautiful models of\r\nthe remains of Grecian architecture which are to be seen at Paris. To\r\nadapt the exterior to our use, I drew a plan for the interior, with\r\nthe apartments necessary for legislative, executive, and judiciary\r\npurposes; and accommodated in their size and distribution to the form\r\nand dimensions of the building. These were forwarded to the Directors,\r\nin 1786, and were carried into execution, with some variations, not\r\nfor the better, the most important of which, however, admit of future\r\ncorrection. With respect to the plan of a Prison, requested at the\r\nsame time, I had heard of a benevolent society, in England, which had\r\nbeen indulged by the government, in an experiment of the effect of\r\nlabor, in _solitary confinement_, on some of their criminals; which\r\nexperiment had succeeded beyond expectation. The same idea had been\r\nsuggested in France, and an Architect of Lyons had proposed a plan of\r\na well-contrived edifice, on the principle of solitary confinement.\r\nI procured a copy, and as it was too large for our purposes, I drew\r\none on a scale less extensive, but susceptible of additions as they\r\nshould be wanting. This I sent to the Directors, instead of a plan of\r\na common prison, in the hope that it would suggest the idea of labor\r\nin solitary confinement, instead of that on the public works, which\r\nwe had adopted in our Revised Code. Its principle, accordingly, but\r\nnot its exact form, was adopted by Latrobe in carrying the plan into\r\nexecution, by the erection of what is now called the Penitentiary,\r\nbuilt under his direction. In the meanwhile, the public opinion was\r\nripening, by time, by reflection, and by the example of Pennsylvania,\r\nwhere labor on the highways had been tried, without approbation, from\r\n1786 to '89, and had been followed by their Penitentiary system on the\r\nprinciple of confinement and labor, which was proceeding auspiciously.\r\nIn 1796, our legislature resumed the subject, and passed the law for\r\namending the Penal laws of the commonwealth. They adopted solitary,\r\ninstead of public, labor, established a gradation in the duration\r\nof the confinement, approximated the style of the law more to the\r\nmodern usage, and, instead of the settled distinctions of murder and\r\nmanslaughter, preserved in my bill, they introduced the new terms of\r\nmurder in the first and second degree. Whether these have produced more\r\nor fewer questions of definition, I am not sufficiently informed of our\r\njudiciary transactions to say. I will here, however, insert the text of\r\nmy bill, with the notes I made in the course of my researches into the\r\nsubject.[15]\r\n\r\nThe acts of Assembly concerning the College of William and Mary,\r\nwere properly within Mr. Pendleton's portion of our work; but these\r\nrelated chiefly to its revenue, while its constitution, organization\r\nand scope of science, were derived from its charter. We thought that\r\non this subject, a systematical plan of general education should be\r\nproposed, and I was requested to undertake it. I accordingly prepared\r\nthree bills for the Revisal, proposing three distinct grades of\r\neducation, reaching all classes. 1st. Elementary schools, for all\r\nchildren generally, rich and poor. 2d. Colleges, for a middle degree\r\nof instruction, calculated for the common purposes of life, and such\r\nas would be desirable for all who were in easy circumstances. And, 3d,\r\nan ultimate grade for teaching the sciences generally, and in their\r\nhighest degree. The first bill proposed to lay off every county into\r\nHundreds, or Wards, of a proper size and population for a school, in\r\nwhich reading, writing, and common arithmetic should be taught; and\r\nthat the whole State should be divided into twenty-four districts,\r\nin each of which should be a school for classical learning, grammar,\r\ngeography, and the higher branches of numerical arithmetic. The second\r\nbill proposed to amend the constitution of William and Mary college,\r\nto enlarge its sphere of science, and to make it in fact a University.\r\nThe third was for the establishment of a library. These bills were not\r\nacted on until the same year, '96, and then only so much of the first\r\nas provided for elementary schools. The College of William and Mary\r\nwas an establishment purely of the Church of England; the Visitors\r\nwere required to be all of that Church; the Professors to subscribe\r\nits thirty-nine Articles; its Students to learn its Catechism; and one\r\nof its fundamental objects was declared to be, to raise up Ministers\r\nfor that church. The religious jealousies, therefore, of all the\r\ndissenters, took alarm lest this might give an ascendancy to the\r\nAnglican sect, and refused acting on that bill. Its local eccentricity,\r\ntoo, and unhealthy autumnal climate, lessened the general inclination\r\ntowards it. And in the Elementary bill, they inserted a provision which\r\ncompletely defeated it; for they left it to the court of each county to\r\ndetermine for itself, when this act should be carried into execution,\r\nwithin their county. One provision of the bill was, that the expenses\r\nof these schools should be borne by the inhabitants of the county,\r\nevery one in proportion to his general tax rate. This would throw on\r\nwealth the education of the poor; and the justices, being generally\r\nof the more wealthy class, were unwilling to incur that burden, and\r\nI believe it was not suffered to commence in a single county. I shall\r\nrecur again to this subject, towards the close of my story, if I should\r\nhave life and resolution enough to reach that term; for I am already\r\ntired of talking about myself.\r\n\r\nThe bill on the subject of slaves, was a mere digest of the existing\r\nlaws respecting them, without any intimation of a plan for a future\r\nand general emancipation. It was thought better that this should be\r\nkept back, and attempted only by way of amendment, whenever the bill\r\nshould be brought on. The principles of the amendment, however, were\r\nagreed on, that is to say, the freedom of all born after a certain\r\nday, and deportation at a proper age. But it was found that the public\r\nmind would not yet bear the proposition, nor will it bear it even at\r\nthis day. Yet the day is not distant when it must bear and adopt it,\r\nor worse will follow. Nothing is more certainly written in the book\r\nof fate, than that these people are to be free; nor is it less certain\r\nthat the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government.\r\nNature, habit, opinion have drawn indelible lines of distinction\r\nbetween them. It is still in our power to direct the process of\r\nemancipation and deportation, peaceably, and in such slow degree,\r\nas that the evil will wear off insensibly, and their place be, _pari\r\npassu_, filled up by free white laborers. If, on the contrary, it is\r\nleft to force itself on, human nature must shudder at the prospect held\r\nup. We should in vain look for an example in the Spanish deportation or\r\ndeletion of the Moors. This precedent would fall far short of our case.\r\n\r\nI considered four of these bills, passed or reported, as forming a\r\nsystem by which every fibre would be eradicated of ancient or future\r\naristocracy; and a foundation laid for a government truly republican.\r\nThe repeal of the laws of entail would prevent the accumulation and\r\nperpetuation of wealth, in select families, and preserve the soil\r\nof the country from being daily more and more absorbed in mortmain.\r\nThe abolition of primogeniture, and equal partition of inheritances,\r\nremoved the feudal and unnatural distinctions which made one member\r\nof every family rich, and all the rest poor, substituting equal\r\npartition, the best of all Agrarian laws. The restoration of the rights\r\nof conscience relieved the people from taxation for the support of a\r\nreligion not theirs; for the establishment was truly of the religion\r\nof the rich, the dissenting sects being entirely composed of the less\r\nwealthy people; and these, by the bill for a general education, would\r\nbe qualified to understand their rights, to maintain them, and to\r\nexercise with intelligence their parts in self-government; and all this\r\nwould be effected, without the violation of a single natural right of\r\nany one individual citizen. To these, too, might be added, as a further\r\nsecurity, the introduction of the trial by jury into the Chancery\r\ncourts, which have already ingulfed, and continue to ingulf, so great\r\na proportion of the jurisdiction over our property.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June, 1779, I was appointed Governor of the Commonwealth,\r\nand retired from the legislature. Being elected, also, one of\r\nthe Visitors of William and Mary college, a self-electing body, I\r\neffected, during my residence in Williamsburg that year, a change\r\nin the organization of that institution, by abolishing the Grammar\r\nschool, and the two professorships of Divinity and Oriental languages,\r\nand substituting a professorship of Law and Police, one of Anatomy,\r\nMedicine and Chemistry, and one of Modern languages; and the charter\r\nconfining us to six professorships, we added the Law of Nature and\r\nNations, and the Fine Arts to the duties of the Moral professor, and\r\nNatural History to those of the professor of Mathematics and Natural\r\nPhilosophy.\r\n\r\nBeing now, as it were, identified with the Commonwealth itself, to\r\nwrite my own history, during the two years of my administration, would\r\nbe to write the public history of that portion of the revolution within\r\nthis State. This has been done by others, and particularly by Mr.\r\nGirardin, who wrote his Continuation of Burke's History of Virginia,\r\nwhile at Milton, in this neighborhood, had free access to all my\r\npapers while composing it, and has given as faithful an account as\r\nI could myself. For this portion, therefore, of my own life, I refer\r\naltogether to his history. From a belief that, under the pressure of\r\nthe invasion under which we were then laboring, the public would have\r\nmore confidence in a Military chief, and that the Military commander,\r\nbeing invested with the Civil power also, both might be wielded with\r\nmore energy, promptitude and effect for the defence of the State, I\r\nresigned the administration at the end of my second year, and General\r\nNelson was appointed to succeed me.\r\n\r\nSoon after my leaving Congress, in September, '76, to wit, on the last\r\nday of that month, I had been appointed, with Dr. Franklin, to go\r\nto France, as a Commissioner, to negotiate treaties of alliance and\r\ncommerce with that government. Silas Deane, then in France, acting\r\nas[16] agent for procuring military stores, was joined with us in\r\ncommission. But such was the state of my family that I could not leave\r\nit, nor could I expose it to the dangers of the sea, and of capture\r\nby the British ships, then covering the ocean. I saw, too, that the\r\nlaboring oar was really at home, where much was to be done, of the\r\nmost permanent interest, in new modelling our governments, and much\r\nto defend our fanes and fire-sides from the desolations of an invading\r\nenemy, pressing on our country in every point. I declined, therefore,\r\nand Dr. Lee was appointed in my place. On the 15th of June, 1781, I had\r\nbeen appointed, with Mr. Adams, Dr. Franklin, Mr. Jay, and Mr. Laurens,\r\na Minister Plenipotentiary for negotiating peace, then expected to\r\nbe effected through the mediation of the Empress of Russia. The same\r\nreasons obliged me still to decline; and the negotiation was in fact\r\nnever entered on. But, in the autumn of the next year, 1782, Congress\r\nreceiving assurances that a general peace would be concluded in the\r\nwinter and spring, they renewed my appointment on the 13th of November\r\nof that year. I had, two months before that, lost the cherished\r\ncompanion of my life, in whose affections, unabated on both sides, I\r\nhad lived the last ten years in unchequered happiness. With the public\r\ninterests, the state of my mind concurred in recommending the change\r\nof scene proposed; and I accepted the appointment, and left Monticello\r\non the 19th of December, 1782, for Philadelphia, where I arrived on\r\nthe 27th. The Minister of France, Luzerne, offered me a passage in the\r\nRomulus frigate, which I accepting; but she was then lying a few miles\r\nbelow Baltimore, blocked up in the ice. I remained, therefore, a month\r\nin Philadelphia, looking over the papers in the office of State, in\r\norder to possess myself of the general state of our foreign relations,\r\nand then went to Baltimore, to await the liberation of the frigate from\r\nthe ice. After waiting there nearly a month, we received information\r\nthat a Provisional treaty of peace had been signed by our Commissioners\r\non the 3d of September, 1782, to become absolute, on the conclusion of\r\npeace between France and Great Britain. Considering my proceeding to\r\nEurope as now of no utility to the public, I returned immediately to\r\nPhiladelphia, to take the orders of Congress, and was excused by them\r\nfrom further proceeding. I, therefore, returned home, where I arrived\r\non the 15th of May, 1783.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of the following month, I was appointed by the legislature\r\na delegate to Congress, the appointment to take place on the 1st of\r\nNovember ensuing, when that of the existing delegation would expire.\r\nI, accordingly, left home on the 16th of October, arrived at Trenton,\r\nwhere Congress was sitting, on the 3d of November, and took my seat on\r\nthe 4th, on which day Congress adjourned, to meet at Annapolis on the\r\n26th.\r\n\r\nCongress had now become a very small body, and the members very remiss\r\nin their attendance on its duties, insomuch, that a majority of the\r\nStates, necessary by the Confederation to constitute a House even for\r\nminor business, did not assemble until the 13th of December.\r\n\r\nThey, as early as January 7,1782, had turned their attention to the\r\nmoneys current in the several States, and had directed the Financier,\r\nRobert Morris, to report to them a table of rates, at which the foreign\r\ncoins should be received at the treasury. That officer, or rather his\r\nassistant, Gouverneur Morris, answered them on the 15th, in an able\r\nand elaborate statement of the denominations of money current in the\r\nseveral States, and of the comparative value of the foreign coins\r\nchiefly in circulation with us. He went into the consideration of\r\nthe necessity of establishing a standard of value with us, and of the\r\nadoption of a money Unit. He proposed for that Unit, such a fraction\r\nof pure silver as would be a common measure of the penny of every\r\nState, without leaving a fraction. This common divisor he found to be\r\n1-1440 of a dollar, or 1-1600 of the crown sterling. The value of a\r\ndollar was, therefore, to be expressed by 1,440 units, and of a crown\r\nby 1,600; each Unit containing a quarter of a grain of fine silver.\r\nCongress turning again their attention to this subject the following\r\nyear, the Financier, by a letter of April 30, 1783, further explained\r\nand urged the Unit he had proposed; but nothing more was done on it\r\nuntil the ensuing year, when it was again taken up, and referred to a\r\ncommittee, of which I was a member. The general views of the Financier\r\nwere sound, and the principle was ingenious on which he proposed to\r\nfound his Unit; but it was too minute for ordinary use, too laborious\r\nfor computation, either by the head or in figures. The price of a loaf\r\nof bread, 1-20 of a dollar, would be 72 units.\r\n\r\nA pound of butter, 1-5 of a dollar, 288 units.\r\n\r\nA horse or bullock, of eighty dollars value, would require a notation\r\nof six figures, to wit, 115,200, and the public debt, suppose of eighty\r\nmillions, would require twelve figures, to wit, 115,200,000,000 units.\r\nSuch a system of money-arithmetic would be entirely unmanageable for\r\nthe common purposes of society. I proposed, therefore, instead of this,\r\nto adopt the Dollar as our Unit of account and payment, and that its\r\ndivisions and sub-divisions should be in the decimal ratio. I wrote\r\nsome Notes on the subject, which I submitted to the consideration of\r\nthe Financier. I received his answer and adherence to his general\r\nsystem, only agreeing to take for his Unit one hundred of those he\r\nfirst proposed, so that a Dollar should be 14 40-100, and a crown 16\r\nunits. I replied to this, and printed my notes and reply on a flying\r\nsheet, which I put into the hands of the members of Congress for\r\nconsideration, and the Committee agreed to report on my principle. This\r\nwas adopted the ensuing year, and is the system which now prevails. I\r\ninsert, here, the Notes and Reply, as showing the different views on\r\nwhich the adoption of our money system hung.[17] The divisions into\r\ndimes, cents, and mills is now so well understood, that it would be\r\neasy of introduction into the kindred branches of weights and measures.\r\nI use, when I travel, an Odometer of Clarke's invention, which divides\r\nthe mile into cents, and I find every one comprehends a distance\r\nreadily, when stated to him in miles and cents; so he would in feet and\r\ncents, pounds and cents, &c.\r\n\r\nThe remissness of Congress, and their permanent session, began to\r\nbe a subject of uneasiness; and even some of the legislatures had\r\nrecommended to them intermissions, and periodical sessions. As\r\nthe Confederation had made no provision for a visible head of the\r\ngovernment, during vacations of Congress, and such a one was necessary\r\nto superintend the executive business, to receive and communicate with\r\nforeign ministers and nations, and to assemble Congress on sudden and\r\nextraordinary emergencies, I proposed, early in April, the appointment\r\nof a committee, to be called the \"Committee of the States,\" to consist\r\nof a member from each State, who should remain in session during the\r\nrecess of Congress: that the functions of Congress should be divided\r\ninto executive and legislative, the latter to be reserved, and the\r\nformer, by a general resolution, to be delegated to that Committee.\r\nThis proposition was afterwards agreed to; a Committee appointed, who\r\nentered on duty on the subsequent adjournment of Congress, quarrelled\r\nvery soon, split into two parties, abandoned their post, and left\r\nthe government without any visible head, until the next meeting in\r\nCongress. We have since seen the same thing take place in the Directory\r\nof France; and I believe it will forever take place in any Executive\r\nconsisting of a plurality. Our plan, best, I believe, combines wisdom\r\nand practicability, by providing a plurality of Counsellors, but a\r\nsingle Arbiter for ultimate decision. I was in France when we heard of\r\nthis schism, and separation of our Committee, and, speaking with Dr.\r\nFranklin of this singular disposition of men to quarrel, and divide\r\ninto parties, he gave his sentiments, as usual, by way of Apologue. He\r\nmentioned the Eddystone lighthouse, in the British channel, as being\r\nbuilt on a rock, in the mid-channel, totally inaccessible in winter,\r\nfrom the boisterous character of that sea, in that season; that,\r\ntherefore, for the two keepers employed to keep up the lights, all\r\nprovisions for the winter were necessarily carried to them in autumn,\r\nas they could never be visited again till the return of the milder\r\nseason; that, on the first practicable day in the spring, a boat put\r\noff to them with fresh supplies. The boatmen met at the door one of\r\nthe keepers, and accosted him with a \"How goes it, friend? Very well.\r\nHow is your companion? I do not know. Don't know? Is not he here? I\r\ncan't tell. Have not you seen him to-day? No. When did you see him? Not\r\nsince last fall. You have killed him? Not I, indeed.\" They were about\r\nto lay hold of him, as having certainly murdered his companion; but\r\nhe desired them to go up stairs and examine for themselves. They went\r\nup, and there found the other keeper. They had quarrelled, it seems,\r\nsoon after being left there, had divided into two parties, assigned the\r\ncares below to one, and those above to the other, and had never spoken\r\nto, or seen, one another since.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our Congress at Annapolis. The definitive treaty of\r\npeace which had been signed at Paris on the 3d of September, 1783,\r\nand received here, could not be ratified without a House of nine\r\nStates. On the 23d of December, therefore, we addressed letters to\r\nthe several Governors, stating the receipt of the definitive treaty;\r\nthat seven States only were in attendance, while nine were necessary\r\nto its ratification; and urging them to press on their delegates the\r\nnecessity of their immediate attendance. And on the 26th, to save time,\r\nI moved that the Agent of Marine (Robert Morris) should be instructed\r\nto have ready a vessel at this place, at New York, and at some Eastern\r\nport, to carry over the ratification of the treaty when agreed to.\r\nIt met the general sense of the House, but was opposed by Dr. Lee,\r\non the ground of expense, which it would authorize the Agent to incur\r\nfor us; and, he said, it would be better to ratify at once, and send\r\non the ratification. Some members had before suggested, that seven\r\nStates were competent to the ratification. My motion was therefore\r\npostponed, and another brought forward by Mr. Read, of South Carolina,\r\nfor an immediate ratification. This was debated the 26th and 27th.\r\nReed, Lee, Williamson and Jeremiah Chase, urged that ratification was\r\na mere matter of form, that the treaty was conclusive from the moment\r\nit was signed by the ministers; that, although the Confederation\r\nrequires the assent of _nine States to enter into_ a treaty, yet, that\r\nits conclusion could not be called _entrance into it_; that supposing\r\nnine States requisite, it would be in the power of five States to\r\nkeep us always at war; that nine States had virtually authorized the\r\nratification, having ratified the provisional treaty, and instructed\r\ntheir ministers to agree to a definitive one in the same terms, and\r\nthe present one was, in fact, substantially, and almost verbatim, the\r\nsame; that there now remain but sixty-seven days for the ratification,\r\nfor its passage across the Atlantic, and its exchange; that there was\r\nno hope of our soon having nine States present; in fact, that this was\r\nthe ultimate point of time to which we could venture to wait; that if\r\nthe ratification was not in Paris by the time stipulated, the treaty\r\nwould become void; that if ratified by seven States, it would go under\r\nour seal, without its being known to Great Britain that only seven had\r\nconcurred; that it was a question of which they had no right to take\r\ncognizance, and we were only answerable for it to our constituents;\r\nthat it was like the ratification which Great Britain had received from\r\nthe Dutch, by the negotiations of Sir William Temple.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it was argued by Monroe, Gerry, Howell, Ellery and\r\nmyself, that by the modern usage of Europe, the ratification was\r\nconsidered as the act which gave validity to a treaty, until which, it\r\nwas not obligatory.[18] That the commission to the ministers reserved\r\nthe ratification to Congress; that the treaty itself stipulated\r\nthat it should be ratified; that it became a second question, who\r\nwere competent to the ratification? That the Confederation expressly\r\nrequired nine States to enter into any treaty; that, by this, that\r\ninstrument must have intended, that the assent of nine States should\r\nbe necessary, as well to the _completion_ as to the _commencement_ of\r\nthe treaty, its object having been to guard the rights of the Union in\r\nall those important cases where nine States are called for; that by the\r\ncontrary construction, seven States, containing less than one-third\r\nof our whole citizens, might rivet on us a treaty, commenced indeed\r\nunder commission and instructions from nine States, but formed by the\r\nminister in express contradiction to such instructions, and in direct\r\nsacrifice of the interests of so great a majority; that the definitive\r\ntreaty was admitted not to be a verbal copy of the provisional one,\r\nand whether the departures from it were of substance, or not, was a\r\nquestion on which nine States alone were competent to decide; that\r\nthe circumstances of the ratification of the provisional articles by\r\nnine States, the instructions to our ministers to form a definitive\r\none by them, and their actual agreement in substance, do not render\r\nus competent to ratify in the present instance; if these circumstances\r\nare in themselves a ratification, nothing further is requisite than to\r\ngive attested copies of them, in exchange for the British ratification;\r\nif they are not, we remain where we were, without a ratification by\r\nnine States, and incompetent ourselves to ratify; that it was but four\r\ndays since the seven States, now present, unanimously concurred in\r\na resolution, to be forwarded to the Governors of the absent States,\r\nin which they stated, as a cause for urging on their delegates, that\r\nnine States were necessary to ratify the treaty; that in the case of\r\nthe Dutch ratification, Great Britain had courted it, and therefore\r\nwas glad to accept it as it was; that they knew our Constitution, and\r\nwould object to a ratification by seven; that, if that circumstance was\r\nkept back, it would be known hereafter, and would give them ground to\r\ndeny the validity of a ratification, into which they should have been\r\nsurprised and cheated, and it would be a dishonorable prostitution\r\nof our seal; that there is a hope of nine States; that if the treaty\r\nwould become null, if not ratified in time, it would not be saved by\r\nan imperfect ratification; but that, in fact, it would not be null,\r\nand would be placed on better ground, going in unexceptionable form,\r\nthough a few days too late, and rested on the small importance of this\r\ncircumstance, and the physical impossibilities which had prevented a\r\npunctual compliance in point of time; that this would be approved by\r\nall nations, and by Great Britain herself, if not determined to renew\r\nthe war, and if so determined, she would never want excuses, were this\r\nout of the way. Mr. Read gave notice, he should call for the yeas and\r\nnays; whereon those in opposition, prepared a resolution, expressing\r\npointedly the reasons of their dissent from his motion. It appearing,\r\nhowever, that his proposition could not be carried, it was thought\r\nbetter to make no entry at all. Massachusetts alone would have been\r\nfor it; Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Virginia against it, Delaware,\r\nMaryland and North Carolina, would have been divided.\r\n\r\nOur body was little numerous, but very contentious. Day after day\r\nwas wasted on the most unimportant questions. A member, one of those\r\nafflicted with the morbid rage of debate, of an ardent mind, prompt\r\nimagination, and copious flow of words, who heard with impatience any\r\nlogic which was not his own, sitting near me on some occasion of a\r\ntrifling but wordy debate, asked me how I could sit in silence, hearing\r\nso much false reasoning, which a word should refute? I observed to him,\r\nthat to refute indeed was easy, but to silence was impossible; that in\r\nmeasures brought forward by myself, I took the laboring oar, as was\r\nincumbent on me; but that in general, I was willing to listen; that\r\nif every sound argument or objection was used by some one or other of\r\nthe numerous debaters, it was enough; if not, I thought it sufficient\r\nto suggest the omission, without going into a repetition of what had\r\nbeen already said by others: that this was a waste and abuse of the\r\ntime and patience of the House, which could not be justified. And I\r\nbelieve, that if the members of deliberate bodies were to observe this\r\ncourse generally, they would do in a day, what takes them a week; and\r\nit is really more questionable, than may at first be thought, whether\r\nBonaparte's dumb legislature, which said nothing, and did much, may\r\nnot be preferable to one which talks much, and does nothing. I served\r\nwith General Washington in the legislature of Virginia, before the\r\nrevolution, and, during it, with Dr. Franklin in Congress. I never\r\nheard either of them speak ten minutes at a time, nor to any but the\r\nmain point, which was to decide the question. They laid their shoulders\r\nto the great points, knowing that the little ones would follow of\r\nthemselves. If the present Congress errs in too much talking, how can\r\nit be otherwise, in a body to which the people send one hundred and\r\nfifty lawyers, whose trade it is to question everything, yield nothing,\r\nand talk by the hour? That one hundred and fifty lawyers should do\r\nbusiness together, ought not to be expected. But to return again to our\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThose who thought seven States competent to the ratification, being\r\nvery restless under the loss of their motion, I proposed, on the\r\nthird of January, to meet them on middle ground, and therefore moved a\r\nresolution, which premised, that there were but seven States present,\r\nwho were unanimous for the ratification, but that they differed in\r\nopinion on the question of competency; that those however in the\r\nnegative were unwilling that any powers which it might be supposed\r\nthey possessed, should remain unexercised for the restoration of\r\npeace, provided it could be done, saving their good faith, and without\r\nimporting any opinion of Congress, that seven States were competent,\r\nand resolving that the treaty be ratified so far as they had power;\r\nthat it should be transmitted to our ministers, with instructions to\r\nkeep it uncommunicated; to endeavor to obtain three months longer for\r\nexchange of ratifications; that they should be informed, that so soon\r\nas nine States shall be present, a ratification by nine shall be sent\r\nthem: if this should get to them before the ultimate point of time for\r\nexchange, they were to use it, and not the other; if not, they were\r\nto offer the act of the seven States in exchange, informing them the\r\ntreaty had come to hand while Congress was not in session; that but\r\nseven States were as yet assembled, and these had unanimously concurred\r\nin the ratification. This was debated on the third and fourth; and\r\non the fifth, a vessel being to sail for England, from this port\r\n(Annapolis), the House directed the President to write to our ministers\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nJanuary 14. Delegates from Connecticut having attended yesterday, and\r\nanother from South Carolina coming in this day, the treaty was ratified\r\nwithout a dissenting voice; and three instruments of ratification\r\nwere ordered to be made out, one of which was sent by Colonel Harmer,\r\nanother by Colonel Franks, and the third transmitted to the Agent of\r\nMarine, to be forwarded by any good opportunity.\r\n\r\nCongress soon took up the consideration of their foreign relations.\r\nThey deemed it necessary to get their commerce placed with every\r\nnation, on a footing as favorable as that of other nations; and for\r\nthis purpose, to propose to each a distinct treaty of commerce.\r\nThis act too would amount to an acknowledgment, by each, of our\r\nindependence, and of our reception into the fraternity of nations;\r\nwhich, although as possessing our station of right, and in fact\r\nwe would not condescend to ask, we were not unwilling to furnish\r\nopportunities for receiving their friendly salutations and welcome.\r\nWith France, the United Netherlands, and Sweden, we had already\r\ntreaties of commerce; but commissions were given for those countries\r\nalso, should any amendments be thought necessary. The other States to\r\nwhich treaties were to be proposed, were England, Hamburg, Saxony,\r\nPrussia, Denmark, Russia, Austria, Venice, Rome, Naples, Tuscany,\r\nSardinia, Genoa, Spain, Portugal, the Porte, Algiers, Tripoli, Tunis,\r\nand Morocco.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of May Congress resolved that a Minister Plenipotentiary\r\nshould be appointed, in addition to Mr. Adams and Dr. Franklin, for\r\nnegotiating treaties of commerce with foreign nations, and I was\r\nelected to that duty. I accordingly left Annapolis on the 11th, took\r\nwith me my eldest daughter, then at Philadelphia (the two others being\r\ntoo young for the voyage), and proceeded to Boston, in quest of a\r\npassage. While passing through the different States, I made a point of\r\ninforming myself of the state of the commerce of each; went on to New\r\nHampshire with the same view, and returned to Boston. Thence I sailed\r\non the 5th of July, in the Ceres, a merchant ship of Mr. Nathaniel\r\nTracey, bound to Cowes. He was himself a passenger, and, after a\r\npleasant voyage of nineteen days, from land to land, we arrived at\r\nCowes on the 26th. I was detained there a few days by the indisposition\r\nof my daughter. On the 30th, we embarked for Havre, arrived there on\r\nthe 31st, left it on the 3d of August, and arrived at Paris on the 6th.\r\nI called immediately on Dr. Franklin, at Passy, communicated to him\r\nour charge, and we wrote to Mr. Adams, then at the Hague, to join us at\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nBefore I had left America, that is to say, in the year 1781, I had\r\nreceived a letter from M. de Marbois, of the French legation in\r\nPhiladelphia, informing me, he had been instructed by his government to\r\nobtain such statistical accounts of the different States of our Union,\r\nas might be useful for their information; and addressing to me a number\r\nof queries relative to the State of Virginia. I had always made it a\r\npractice, whenever an opportunity occurred of obtaining any information\r\nof our country, which might be of use to me in any station, public\r\nor private, to commit it to writing. These memoranda were on loose\r\npapers, bundled up without order, and difficult of recurrence, when\r\nI had occasion for a particular one. I thought this a good occasion\r\nto embody their substance, which I did in the order of Mr. Marbois'\r\nqueries, so as to answer his wish, and to arrange them for my own\r\nuse. Some friends, to whom they were occasionally communicated, wished\r\nfor copies; but their volume rendering this too laborious by hand, I\r\nproposed to get a few printed, for their gratification. I was asked\r\nsuch a price, however, as exceeded the importance of the object. On\r\nmy arrival at Paris, I found it could be done for a fourth of what I\r\nhad been asked here. I therefore corrected and enlarged them, and had\r\ntwo hundred copies printed, under the title of \"Notes on Virginia.\"\r\nI gave a very few copies to some particular friends in Europe, and\r\nsent the rest to my friends in America. An European copy, by the death\r\nof the owner, got into the hands of a bookseller, who engaged its\r\ntranslation, and when ready for the press, communicated his intentions\r\nand manuscript to me, suggesting that I should correct it, without\r\nasking any other permission for the publication. I never had seen so\r\nwretched an attempt at translation. Interverted, abridged, mutilated,\r\nand often reversing the sense of the original, I found it a blotch of\r\nerrors, from beginning to end. I corrected some of the most material,\r\nand, in that form, it was printed in French. A London bookseller, on\r\nseeing the translation, requested me to permit him to print the English\r\noriginal. I thought it best to do so, to let the world see that it was\r\nnot really so bad as the French translation had made it appear. And\r\nthis is the true history of that publication.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams soon joined us at Paris, and our first employment was to\r\nprepare a general form, to be proposed to such nations as were disposed\r\nto treat with us. During the negotiations for peace with the British\r\nCommissioner, David Hartley, our Commissioners had proposed, on the\r\nsuggestion of Dr. Franklin, to insert an article, exempting from\r\ncapture by the public or private armed ships, of either belligerent,\r\nwhen at war, all merchant vessels and their cargoes, employed merely\r\nin carrying on the commerce between nations. It was refused by\r\nEngland, and unwisely, in my opinion. For, in the case of a war with\r\nus, their superior commerce places infinitely more at hazard on the\r\nocean, than ours; and, as hawks abound in proportion to game, so our\r\nprivateers would swarm, in proportion to the wealth exposed to their\r\nprize, while theirs would be few, for want of subjects of capture.\r\nWe inserted this article in our form, with a provision against the\r\nmolestation of fishermen, husbandmen, citizens unarmed, and following\r\ntheir occupations in unfortified places, for the humane treatment of\r\nprisoners of war, the abolition of contraband of war, which exposes\r\nmerchant vessels to such vexatious and ruinous detentions and abuses;\r\nand for the principle of free bottoms, free goods.\r\n\r\nIn a conference with the Count de Vergennes, it was thought better to\r\nleave to legislative regulation, on both sides, such modifications of\r\nour commercial intercourse, as would voluntarily flow from amicable\r\ndispositions. Without urging, we sounded the ministers of the several\r\nEuropean nations, at the court of Versailles, on their dispositions\r\ntowards mutual commerce, and the expediency of encouraging it by the\r\nprotection of a treaty. Old Frederic, of Prussia, met us cordially,\r\nand without hesitation, and appointing the Baron de Thulemeyer, his\r\nminister at the Hague, to negotiate with us, we communicated to him our\r\nProjét, which, with little alteration by the King, was soon concluded.\r\nDenmark and Tuscany, entered also into negotiations with us. Other\r\npowers appearing indifferent; we did not think it proper to press them.\r\nThey seemed, in fact, to know little about us, but as rebels, who had\r\nbeen successful in throwing off the yoke of the mother country. They\r\nwere ignorant of our commerce, which had been always monopolized by\r\nEngland, and of the exchange of articles it might offer advantageously\r\nto both parties. They were inclined, therefore, to stand aloof, until\r\nthey could see better what relations might be usefully instituted with\r\nus. The negotiations, therefore, begun with Denmark and Tuscany, we\r\nprotracted designedly, until our powers had expired; and abstained\r\nfrom making new propositions to others having no colonies; because our\r\ncommerce being an exchange of raw for wrought materials, is a competent\r\nprice for admission into the colonies of those possessing them; but\r\nwere we to give it, without price, to others, all would claim it,\r\nwithout price, on the ordinary ground of _gentis amicissimæ_.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams being appointed Minister Plenipotentiary of the United\r\nStates, to London, left us in June, and in July, 1785, Dr. Franklin\r\nreturned to America, and I was appointed his successor at Paris. In\r\nFebruary, 1786, Mr. Adams wrote to me, pressingly, to join him in\r\nLondon immediately, as he thought he discovered there some symptoms\r\nof better disposition towards us. Colonel Smith, his secretary of\r\nlegation, was the bearer of his urgencies for my immediate attendance.\r\nI, accordingly, left Paris on the 1st of March, and, on my arrival\r\nin London, we agreed on a very summary form of treaty, proposing\r\nan exchange of citizenship for our citizens, our ships, and our\r\nproductions generally, except as to office. On my presentation, as\r\nusual, to the King and Queen, at their levées, it was impossible for\r\nanything to be more ungracious, than their notice of Mr. Adams and\r\nmyself. I saw, at once, that the ulcerations of mind in that quarter,\r\nleft nothing to be expected on the subject of my attendance; and, on\r\nthe first conference with the Marquis of Caermarthen, the Minister for\r\nforeign affairs, the distance and disinclination which he betrayed\r\nin his conversation, the vagueness and evasions of his answers to\r\nus, confirmed me in the belief of their aversion to have anything\r\nto do with us. We delivered him, however, our Projét, Mr. Adams not\r\ndespairing as much as I did, of its effect. We afterwards, by one or\r\nmore notes, requested his appointment of an interview and conference,\r\nwhich, without directly declining, he evaded, by pretences of other\r\npressing occupations for the moment. After staying there seven weeks,\r\ntill within a few days of the expiration of our commission, I informed\r\nthe minister, by note, that my duties at Paris required my return to\r\nthat place, and that I should, with pleasure, be the bearer of any\r\ncommands to his Ambassador there. He answered, that he had none, and,\r\nwishing me a pleasant journey, I left London the 26th, and arrived at\r\nParis the 30th of April.\r\n\r\nWhile in London, we entered into negotiations with the Chevalier Pinto,\r\nAmbassador of Portugal, at that place. The only article of difficulty\r\nbetween us was, a stipulation that our bread stuff should be received\r\nin Portugal, in the form of flour as well as of grain. He approved\r\nof it himself, but observed that several Nobles, of great influence\r\nat their court, were the owners of wind-mills in the neighborhood of\r\nLisbon, which depended much for their profits on manufacturing our\r\nwheat, and that this stipulation would endanger the whole treaty. He\r\nsigned it, however, and its fate was what he had candidly portended.\r\n\r\nMy duties, at Paris, were confined to a few objects; the receipt of\r\nour whale-oils, salted fish, and salted meats, on favorable terms;\r\nthe admission of our rice on equal terms with that of Piedmont,\r\nEgypt and the Levant; a mitigation of the monopolies of our tobacco\r\nby the Farmers-general, and a free admission of our productions into\r\ntheir islands, were the principal commercial objects which required\r\nattention; and, on these occasions, I was powerfully aided by all\r\nthe influence and the energies of the Marquis de La Fayette, who\r\nproved himself equally zealous for the friendship and welfare of both\r\nnations; and, in justice, I must also say, that I found the government\r\nentirely disposed to befriend us on all occasions, and to yield us\r\nevery indulgence, not absolutely injurious to themselves. The Count de\r\nVergennes had the reputation, with the diplomatic corps, of being wary\r\nand slippery in his diplomatic intercourse; and so he might be with\r\nthose whom he knew to be slippery, and double-faced themselves. As he\r\nsaw that I had no indirect views, practised no subtleties, meddled in\r\nno intrigues, pursued no concealed object, I found him as frank, as\r\nhonorable, as easy of access to reason, as any man with whom I had ever\r\ndone business; and I must say the same for his successor, Montmorin,\r\none of the most honest and worthy of human beings.\r\n\r\nOur commerce, in the Mediterranean, was placed under early alarm, by\r\nthe capture of two of our vessels and crews by the Barbary cruisers.\r\nI was very unwilling that we should acquiesce in the European\r\nhumiliation, of paying a tribute to those lawless pirates, and\r\nendeavored to form an association of the powers subject to habitual\r\ndepredations from them. I accordingly prepared, and proposed to their\r\nMinisters at Paris, for consultation with their governments, articles\r\nof a special confederation, in the following form:\r\n\r\n\"Proposals for concerted operation among the powers at war with the\r\npiratical States of Barbary.\r\n\r\n1. \"It is proposed, that the several powers at war with the piratical\r\nStates of Barbary, or any two or more of them who shall be willing,\r\nshall enter into a convention to carry on their operations against\r\nthose States, in concert, beginning with the Algerines.\r\n\r\n2. \"This convention shall remain open to any other powers, who shall,\r\nat any future time, wish to accede to it; the parties reserving the\r\nright to prescribe the conditions of such accession, according to the\r\ncircumstances existing at the time it shall be proposed.\r\n\r\n3. \"The object of the convention shall be, to compel the piratical\r\nStates to perpetual peace, without price, and to guarantee that peace\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\n4. \"The operations for obtaining this peace shall be constant cruises\r\non their coast, with a naval force now to be agreed on. It is not\r\nproposed that this force shall be so considerable as to be inconvenient\r\nto any party. It is believed that half a dozen frigates, with as many\r\nTenders or Xebecs, one half of which shall be in cruise, while the\r\nother half is at rest, will suffice.\r\n\r\n5. \"The force agreed to be necessary, shall be furnished by the\r\nparties, in certain quotas, now to be fixed; it being expected, that\r\neach will be willing to contribute, in such proportion as circumstances\r\nmay render reasonable.\r\n\r\n6. \"As miscarriages often proceed from the want of harmony among\r\nofficers of different nations, the parties shall now consider and\r\ndecide, whether it will not be better to contribute their quotas in\r\nmoney, to be employed in fitting out and keeping on duty, a single\r\nfleet of the force agreed on.\r\n\r\n7. \"The difficulties and delays, too, which will attend the management\r\nof these operations, if conducted by the parties themselves separately,\r\ndistant as their courts may be from one another, and incapable of\r\nmeeting in consultation, suggest a question, whether it will not\r\nbe better for them to give full powers, for that purpose, to their\r\nAmbassadors, or other Ministers resident at some one court of Europe,\r\nwho shall form a Committee, or Council, for carrying this convention\r\ninto effect; wherein, the vote of each member shall be computed in\r\nproportion to the quota of his sovereign, and the majority so computed,\r\nshall prevail in all questions within the view of this convention. The\r\ncourt of Versailles is proposed, on account of its neighborhood to the\r\nMediterranean, and because all those powers are represented there, who\r\nare likely to become parties to this convention.\r\n\r\n8. \"To save to that Council the embarrassment of personal solicitations\r\nfor office, and to assure the parties that their contributions will\r\nbe applied solely to the object for which they are destined, there\r\nshall be no establishment of officers for the said Council, such as\r\nCommissioners, Secretaries, or any other kind, with either salaries\r\nor perquisites, nor any other lucrative appointments but such whose\r\nfunctions are to be exercised on board the said vessels.\r\n\r\n9. \"Should war arise between any two of the parties to this convention,\r\nit shall not extend to this enterprise, nor interrupt it; but as to\r\nthis they shall be reputed at peace.\r\n\r\n10. \"When Algiers shall be reduced to peace, the other piratical\r\nStates, if they refuse to discontinue their piracies, shall become the\r\nobjects of this convention, either successively or together, as shall\r\nseem best.\r\n\r\n11. \"Where this convention would interfere with treaties actually\r\nexisting between any of the parties and the States of Barbary, the\r\ntreaty shall prevail, and such party shall be allowed to withdraw from\r\nthe operations against that State.\"\r\n\r\nSpain had just concluded a treaty with Algiers, at the expense of\r\nthree millions of dollars, and did not like to relinquish the benefit\r\nof that, until the other party should fail in their observance of\r\nit. Portugal, Naples, the two Sicilies, Venice, Malta, Denmark and\r\nSweden, were favorably disposed to such an association; but their\r\nrepresentatives at Paris expressed apprehensions that France would\r\ninterfere, and, either openly or secretly, support the Barbary powers;\r\nand they required, that I should ascertain the dispositions of the\r\nCount de Vergennes on the subject. I had before taken occasion to\r\ninform him of what we were proposing, and, therefore, did not think it\r\nproper to insinuate any doubt of the fair conduct of his government;\r\nbut, stating our propositions, I mentioned the apprehensions\r\nentertained by us, that England would interfere in behalf of those\r\npiratical governments. \"She dares not do it,\" said he. I pressed it\r\nno further. The other Agents were satisfied with this indication of\r\nhis sentiments, and nothing was now wanting to bring it into direct\r\nand formal consideration, but the assent of our government, and their\r\nauthority to make the formal proposition. I communicated to them\r\nthe favorable prospect of protecting our commerce from the Barbary\r\ndepredations, and for such a continuance of time, as, by an exclusion\r\nof them from the sea, to change their habits and characters, from a\r\npredatory to an agricultural people: towards which, however, it was\r\nexpected they would contribute a frigate, and its expenses, to be\r\nin constant cruise. But they were in no condition to make any such\r\nengagement. Their recommendatory powers for obtaining contributions,\r\nwere so openly neglected by the several States, that they declined\r\nan engagement which they were conscious they could not fulfil with\r\npunctuality; and so it fell through.\r\n\r\n[19]In 1786, while at Paris, I became acquainted with John Ledyard,\r\nof Connecticut, a man of genius, of some science, and of fearless\r\ncourage and enterprise. He had accompanied Captain Cook in his voyage\r\nto the Pacific, had distinguished himself on several occasions by an\r\nunrivalled intrepidity, and published an account of that voyage, with\r\ndetails unfavorable to Cook's deportment towards the savages, and\r\nlessening our regrets at his fate. Ledyard had come to Paris, in the\r\nhope of forming a company to engage in the fur trade of the Western\r\ncoast of America. He was disappointed in this, and, being out of\r\nbusiness, and of a roaming, restless character, I suggested to him the\r\nenterprise of exploring the Western part of our continent, by passing\r\nthrough St. Petersburg to Kamschatka, and procuring a passage thence in\r\nsome of the Russian vessels to Nootka Sound, whence he might make his\r\nway across the continent to the United States; and I undertook to have\r\nthe permission of the Empress of Russia solicited. He eagerly embraced\r\nthe proposition, and M. de Sémoulin, the Russian Ambassador, and more\r\nparticularly Baron Grimm, the special correspondent of the Empress,\r\nsolicited her permission for him to pass through her dominions, to the\r\nWestern coast of America. And here I must correct a material error,\r\nwhich I have committed in another place, to the prejudice of the\r\nEmpress. In writing some notes of the life of Captain Lewis, prefixed\r\nto his \"Expedition to the Pacific,\" I stated that the Empress gave\r\nthe permission asked, and afterwards retracted it. This idea, after a\r\nlapse of twenty-six years, had so insinuated itself into my mind, that\r\nI committed it to paper, without the least suspicion of error. Yet I\r\nfind, on recurring to my letters of that date, that the Empress refused\r\npermission at once, considering the enterprise as entirely chimerical.\r\nBut Ledyard would not relinquish it, persuading himself that, by\r\nproceeding to St. Petersburg, he could satisfy the Empress of its\r\npracticability, and obtain her permission. He went accordingly, but she\r\nwas absent on a visit to some distant part of her dominions,[20] and he\r\npursued his course to within two hundred miles of Kamschatka, where he\r\nwas overtaken by an arrest from the Empress, brought back to Poland,\r\nand there dismissed. I must therefore, in justice, acquit the Empress\r\nof ever having for a moment countenanced, even by the indulgence of an\r\ninnocent passage through her territories, this interesting enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe pecuniary distresses of France produced this year a measure\r\nof which there had been no example for near two centuries, and the\r\nconsequences of which, good and evil, are not yet calculable. For its\r\nremote causes, we must go a little back.\r\n\r\nCelebrated writers of France and England had already sketched good\r\nprinciples on the subject of government; yet the American Revolution\r\nseems first to have awakened the thinking part of the French nation\r\nin general, from the sleep of despotism in which they were sunk.\r\nThe officers too, who had been to America, were mostly young men,\r\nless shackled by habit and prejudice, and more ready to assent to\r\nthe suggestions of common sense, and feeling of common rights, than\r\nothers. They came back with new ideas and impressions. The press,\r\nnotwithstanding its shackles, began to disseminate them; conversation\r\nassumed new freedoms; Politics became the theme of all societies, male\r\nand female, and a very extensive and zealous party was formed, which\r\nacquired the appellation of the Patriotic party, who, sensible of\r\nthe abusive government under which they lived, sighed for occasions\r\nof reforming it. This party comprehended all the honesty of the\r\nkingdom, sufficiently at leisure to think, the men of letters, the\r\neasy Bourgeois, the young nobility, partly from reflection, partly\r\nfrom mode; for these sentiments became matter of mode, and as such,\r\nunited most of the young women to the party. Happily for the nation,\r\nit happened, at the same moment, that the dissipations of the Queen\r\nand court, the abuses of the pension-list, and dilapidations in the\r\nadministration of every branch of the finances, had exhausted the\r\ntreasures and credit of the nation, insomuch that its most necessary\r\nfunctions were paralyzed. To reform these abuses would have overset\r\nthe Minister; to impose new taxes by the authority of the King,\r\nwas known to be impossible, from the determined opposition of the\r\nParliament to their enregistry. No resource remained then, but to\r\nappeal to the nation. He advised, therefore, the call of an Assembly\r\nof the most distinguished characters of the nation, in the hope that,\r\nby promises of various and valuable improvements in the organization\r\nand regimen of the government, they would be induced to authorize new\r\ntaxes, to control the opposition of the Parliament, and to raise the\r\nannual revenue to the level of expenditures. An Assembly of Notables\r\ntherefore, about one hundred and fifty in number, named by the King,\r\nconvened on the 22d of February. The Minister (Calonne) stated to them,\r\nthat the annual excess of expenses beyond the revenue, when Louis XVI.\r\ncame to the throne, was thirty-seven millions of livres; that four\r\nhundred and forty millions had been borrowed to re-establish the navy;\r\nthat the American war had cost them fourteen hundred and forty millions\r\n(two hundred and fifty-six millions of dollars), and that the interest\r\nof these sums, with other increased expenses, had added forty millions\r\nmore to the annual deficit. (But a subsequent and more candid estimate\r\nmade it fifty-six millions.) He proffered them an universal redress\r\nof grievances, laid open those grievances fully, pointed out sound\r\nremedies, and, covering his canvas with objects of this magnitude, the\r\ndeficit dwindled to a little accessory, scarcely attracting attention.\r\nThe persons chosen were the most able and independent characters in the\r\nkingdom, and their support, if it could be obtained, would be enough\r\nfor him. They improved the occasion for redressing their grievances,\r\nand agreed that the public wants should be relieved; but went into an\r\nexamination of the causes of them. It was supposed that Colonne was\r\nconscious that his accounts could not bear examination; and it was\r\nsaid, and believed, that he asked of the King, to send four members\r\nto the Bastile, of whom the Marquis de La Fayette was one, to banish\r\ntwenty others, and two of his Ministers. The King found it shorter to\r\nbanish him. His successor went on in full concert with the Assembly.\r\nThe result was an augmentation of the revenue, a promise of economies\r\nin its expenditure, of an annual settlement of the public accounts\r\nbefore a council, which the Comptroller, having been heretofore obliged\r\nto settle only with the King in person, of course never settled at all;\r\nan acknowledgment that the King could not lay a new tax, a reformation\r\nof the Criminal laws, abolition of torture, suppression of corvees,\r\nreformation of the gabelles, removal of the interior Custom Houses,\r\nfree commerce of grain, internal and external, and the establishment of\r\nProvincial Assemblies; which, altogether, constituted a great mass of\r\nimprovement in the condition of the nation. The establishment of the\r\nProvincial Assemblies was, in itself, a fundamental improvement. They\r\nwould be of the choice of the people, one-third renewed every year,\r\nin those provinces where there are no States, that is to say, over\r\nabout three-fourths of the kingdom. They would be partly an Executive\r\nthemselves, and partly an Executive Council to the Intendant, to whom\r\nthe Executive power, in his province, had been heretofore entirely\r\ndelegated. Chosen by the people, they would soften the execution\r\nof hard laws, and, having a right of representation to the King,\r\nthey would censure bad laws, suggest good ones, expose abuses, and\r\ntheir representations, when united, would command respect. To the\r\nother advantages, might be added the precedent itself of calling the\r\nAssemblée des Notables, which would perhaps grow into habit. The hope\r\nwas, that the improvements thus promised would be carried into effect;\r\nthat they would be maintained during the present reign, and that that\r\nwould be long enough for them to take some root in the constitution,\r\nso that they might come to be considered as a part of that, and be\r\nprotected by time, and the attachment of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Vergennes had died a few days before the meeting of the\r\nAssembly, and the Count de Montmorin had been named Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, in his place. Villedeuil succeeded Calonne, as Comptroller\r\nGeneral, and Lomenie de Bryenne, Archbishop of Thoulouse, afterwards of\r\nSens, and ultimately Cardinal Lomenie, was named Minister principal,\r\nwith whom the other Ministers were to transact the business of their\r\ndepartments, heretofore done with the King in person; and the Duke de\r\nNivernois, and M. de Malesherbes, were called to the Council. On the\r\nnomination of the Minister principal, the Marshals de Segur and de\r\nCastries retired from the departments of War and Marine, unwilling to\r\nact subordinately, or to share the blame of proceedings taken out of\r\ntheir direction. They were succeeded by the Count de Brienne, brother\r\nof the Prime Minister, and the Marquis de La Luzerne, brother to him\r\nwho had been Minister in the United States.\r\n\r\nA dislocated wrist, unsuccessfully set, occasioned advice from\r\nmy surgeon, to try the mineral waters of Aix, in Provence, as a\r\ncorroborant. I left Paris for that place therefore, on the 28th of\r\nFebruary, and proceeded up the Seine, through Champagne and Burgundy,\r\nand down the Rhone through the Beaujolais by Lyons, Avignon, Nismes to\r\nAix; where, finding on trial no benefit from the waters, I concluded\r\nto visit the rice country of Piedmont, to see if anything might be\r\nlearned there, to benefit the rivalship of our Carolina rice with\r\nthat, and thence to make a tour of the seaport towns of France, along\r\nits Southern and Western coast, to inform myself, if anything could be\r\ndone to favor our commerce with them. From Aix, therefore, I took my\r\nroute by Marseilles, Toulon, Hieres, Nice, across the Col de Tende,\r\nby Coni, Turin, Vercelli, Novara, Milan, Pavia, Novi, Genoa. Thence,\r\nreturning along the coast of Savona, Noli, Albenga, Oneglia, Monaco,\r\nNice, Antibes, Frejus, Aix, Marseilles, Avignon, Nismes, Montpellier,\r\nFrontignan, Cette, Agde, and along the canal of Languedoc, by Bezieres,\r\nNarbonne, Cascassonne, Castelnaudari, through the Souterrain of St.\r\nFeriol, and back by Castelnaudari, to Toulouse; thence to Montauban,\r\nand down the Garonne by Langon to Bordeaux. Thence to Rochefort, la\r\nRochelle, Nantes, L'Orient; then back by Rennes to Nantes, and up\r\nthe Loire by Angers, Tours, Amboise, Blois to Orleans, thence direct\r\nto Paris, where I arrived on the 10th of June. Soon after my return\r\nfrom this journey, to wit, about the latter part of July, I received\r\nmy younger daughter, Maria, from Virginia, by the way of London, the\r\nyoungest having died some time before.\r\n\r\nThe treasonable perfidy of the Prince of Orange, Stadtholder and\r\nCaptain General of the United Netherlands, in the war which England\r\nwaged against them, for entering into a treaty of commerce with the\r\nUnited States, is known to all. As their Executive officer, charged\r\nwith the conduct of the war, he contrived to baffle all the measures of\r\nthe States General, to dislocate all their military plans, and played\r\nfalse into the hands of England against his own country, on every\r\npossible occasion, confident in her protection, and in that of the King\r\nof Prussia, brother to his Princess. The States General, indignant at\r\nthis patricidal conduct, applied to France for aid, according to the\r\nstipulations of the treaty concluded with her in '85. It was assured\r\nto them readily, and in cordial terms, in a letter from the Count de\r\nVergennes, to the Marquis de Verac, Ambassador of France at the Hague,\r\nof which the following is an extract:\r\n\r\n\"Extrait de la depéche de Monsieur le Comte de Vergennes à Monsieur le\r\nMarquis de Verac, Ambassadeur de France à la Haye, du 1er Mars, 1786.\r\n\r\n\"Le Roi concourrera, autant, qu'il sera en son pouvoir, au succes de la\r\nchose, et vous inviterez, de sa part, les patriotes de lui communiquer\r\nleurs vues, leurs plans, et leurs envieux. Vous les assurerez, que le\r\nroi prend un interet veritable à leurs personnes comme à leur cause,\r\net qu'ils peuvent compter sur sa protection. Ils doivent y compter\r\nd'autant plus, Monsieur, que nous ne dissimulons pas, que si Monsieur\r\nle Stadhoulder reprend son ancienne influence, le systeme Anglois ne\r\ntardera pas de prevaloir, et que notre alliance deviendroit un être\r\nde raison. Les Patriotes sentiront facilement, que cette position\r\nseroit incompatible avec la dignite, comme avec la consideration de\r\nsa majesté. Mais dans le cas, Monsieur, ou les chefs des Patriotes\r\nauroient à craindre une scission, ils auroient le temps suffisant\r\npour ramener ceux de leurs amis, que les Anglomanes ont egares, et\r\npreparer les choses de manière que la question de nouveau mise en\r\ndeliberation, soit decidee selon leurs desirs. Dans cette hypothese, le\r\nroi vous autorise à agir de concert avec eux, de suivre la direction\r\nqu'ils jugeront devoir vous donner, et d'employer tous les moyens\r\npour augmenter le nombre des partisans de la bonne cause. Il me reste,\r\nMonsieur, de vous parler de la surete personelle des Patriotes. Vous\r\nles assurerez, que dans tout etat de cause, le roi les prend sous\r\nsa protection immediate, et vous ferez connoitre, partout ou vous\r\nle jugerez necessaire, que sa Majesté regarderoit comme une offense\r\npersonnelle, tout ce qu'on entreprenderoit contre leur liberté. Il est\r\nà presumer que ce langage, tenu avec energie, en imposera a l'audace\r\ndes Anglomanes, et que Monsieur le Prince de Nassau croira courir\r\nquelque risque en provoquant le ressentiment de sa Majesté.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThis letter was communicated by the Patriots to me, when at Amsterdam,\r\nin 1788, and a copy sent by me to Mr. Jay, in my letter to him of March\r\n16, 1788.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Patriots was, to establish a representative and\r\nrepublican government. The majority of the States General were with\r\nthem, but the majority of the populace of the towns was with the Prince\r\nof Orange; and that populace was played off with great effect, by\r\nthe triumvirate of * * * Harris, the English Ambassador, afterwards\r\nLord Malmesbury, the Prince of Orange, a stupid man, and the Princess\r\nas much a man as either of her colleagues, in audaciousness, in\r\nenterprise, and in the thirst of domination. By these, the mobs of the\r\nHague were excited against the members of the States General; their\r\npersons were insulted and endangered in the streets; the sanctuary\r\nof their houses was violated; and the Prince, whose function and\r\nduty it was to repress and punish these violations of order, took no\r\nsteps for that purpose. The States General, for their own protection,\r\nwere therefore obliged to place their militia under the command of\r\na Committee. The Prince filled the courts of London and Berlin with\r\ncomplaints at this usurpation of his prerogatives, and, forgetting\r\nthat he was but the first servant of a Republic, marched his regular\r\ntroops against the city of Utrecht, where the States were in session.\r\nThey were repulsed by the militia. His interests now became marshalled\r\nwith those of the public enemy, and against his own country. The\r\nStates, therefore, exercising their rights of sovereignty, deprived\r\nhim of all his powers. The great Frederic had died in August, '86. He\r\nhad never intended to break with France in support of the Prince of\r\nOrange. During the illness of which he died, he had, through the Duke\r\nof Brunswick, declared to the Marquis de La Fayette, who was then at\r\nBerlin, that he meant not to support the English interest in Holland:\r\nthat he might assure the government of France, his only wish was, that\r\nsome honorable place in the Constitution should be reserved for the\r\nStadtholder and his children, and that he would take no part in the\r\nquarrel, unless an entire abolition of the Stadtholderate should be\r\nattempted. But his place was now occupied by Frederic William, his\r\ngreat nephew, a man of little understanding, much caprice, and very\r\ninconsiderate; and the Princess, his sister, although her husband was\r\nin arms against the legitimate authorities of the country, attempting\r\nto go to Amsterdam, for the purpose of exciting the mobs of that\r\nplace, and being refused permission to pass a military post on the\r\nway, he put the Duke of Brunswick at the head of twenty thousand men,\r\nand made demonstrations of marching on Holland. The King of France\r\nhereupon declared, by his Chargé des Affaires in Holland, that if\r\nthe Prussian troops continued to menace Holland with an invasion, his\r\nMajesty, in quality of Ally, was determined to succor that province.\r\nIn answer to this, Eden gave official information to Count Montmorin,\r\nthat England must consider as at an end its convention with France\r\nrelative to giving notice of its naval armaments, and that she was\r\narming generally. War being now imminent, Eden, since Lord Aukland,\r\nquestioned me on the effect of our treaty with France, in the case\r\nof a war, and what might be our dispositions. I told him frankly,\r\nand without hesitation, that our dispositions would be neutral, and\r\nthat I thought it would be the interest of both these powers that we\r\nshould be so; because, it would relieve both from all anxiety as to\r\nfeeding their West India islands; that England, too, by suffering us to\r\nremain so, would avoid a heavy land war on our Continent, which might\r\nvery much cripple her proceedings elsewhere; that our treaty, indeed,\r\nobliged us to receive into our ports the armed vessels of France,\r\nwith their prizes, and to refuse admission to the prizes made on her\r\nby her enemies: that there was a clause, also, by which we guaranteed\r\nto France her American possessions, which might perhaps force us into\r\nthe war, if these were attacked. \"Then it will be war,\" said he, \"for\r\nthey will assuredly be attacked.\" Liston, at Madrid, about the same\r\ntime, made the same inquiries of Carmichael. The Government of France\r\nthen declared a determination to form a camp of observation at Givet,\r\ncommenced arming her marine, and named the Bailli de Suffrein their\r\nGeneralissimo on the Ocean. She secretly engaged, also, in negotiations\r\nwith Russia, Austria, and Spain, to form a quadruple alliance. The Duke\r\nof Brunswick having advanced to the confines of Holland, sent some\r\nof his officers to Givet, to reconnoitre the state of things there,\r\nand report them to him. He said afterwards, that \"if there had been\r\nonly a few tents at that place, he should not have advanced further,\r\nfor that the King would not, merely for the interest of his sister,\r\nengage in a war with France.\" But, finding that there was not a single\r\ncompany there, he boldly entered the country, took their towns as\r\nfast as he presented himself before them, and advanced on Utrecht. The\r\nStates had appointed the Rhingrave of Salm their Commander-in-Chief;\r\na Prince without talents, without courage, and without principle.\r\nHe might have held out in Utrecht for a considerable time, but he\r\nsurrendered the place without firing a gun, literally ran away and\r\nhid himself, so that for months it was not known what had become of\r\nhim. Amsterdam was then attacked, and capitulated. In the meantime,\r\nthe negotiations for the quadruple alliance were proceeding favorably;\r\nbut the secrecy with which they were attempted to be conducted, was\r\npenetrated by Fraser, Chargé des Affaires of England at St. Petersburg,\r\nwho instantly notified his court, and gave the alarm to Prussia. The\r\nKing saw at once what would be his situation, between the jaws of\r\nFrance, Austria, and Russia. In great dismay, he besought the court\r\nof London not to abandon him, sent Alvensleben to Paris to explain and\r\nsoothe; and England, through the Duke of Dorset and Eden, renewed her\r\nconferences for accommodation. The Archbishop, who shuddered at the\r\nidea of war, and preferred a peaceful surrender of right to an armed\r\nvindication of it, received them with open arms, entered into cordial\r\nconferences, and a declaration, and counter-declaration, were cooked up\r\nat Versailles, and sent to London for approbation. They were approved\r\nthere, reached Paris at one o'clock of the 27th, and were signed that\r\nnight at Versailles. It was said and believed at Paris, that M. de\r\nMontmorin, literally \"pleuroit comme un enfant,\" when obliged to sign\r\nthis counter-declaration; so distressed was he by the dishonor of\r\nsacrificing the Patriots, after assurances so solemn of protection, and\r\nabsolute encouragement to proceed. The Prince of Orange was reinstated\r\nin all his powers, now become regal. A great emigration of the Patriots\r\ntook place; all were deprived of office, many exiled, and their\r\nproperty confiscated. They were received in France, and subsisted,\r\nfor some time, on her bounty. Thus fell Holland, by the treachery\r\nof her Chief, from her honorable independence, to become a province\r\nof England; and so, also, her Stadtholder, from the high station of\r\nthe first citizen of a free Republic, to be the servile Viceroy of a\r\nforeign Sovereign. And this was effected by a mere scene of bullying\r\nand demonstration; not one of the parties, France, England, or Prussia,\r\nhaving ever really meant to encounter actual war for the interest of\r\nthe Prince of Orange. But it had all the effect of a real and decisive\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nOur first essay, in America, to establish a federative government\r\nhad fallen, on trial, very short of its object. During the war of\r\nIndependence, while the pressure of an external enemy hooped us\r\ntogether, and their enterprises kept us necessarily on the alert,\r\nthe spirit of the people, excited by danger, was a supplement to the\r\nConfederation, and urged them to zealous exertions, whether claimed\r\nby that instrument or not; but, when peace and safety were restored,\r\nand every man became engaged in useful and profitable occupation, less\r\nattention was paid to the calls of Congress. The fundamental defect\r\nof the Confederation was, that Congress was not authorized to act\r\nimmediately on the people, and by its own officers. Their power was\r\nonly requisitory, and these requisitions were addressed to the several\r\nLegislatures, to be by them carried into execution, without other\r\ncoercion than the moral principle of duty. This allowed, in fact, a\r\nnegative to every Legislature, on every measure proposed by Congress;\r\na negative so frequently exercised in practice, as to benumb the action\r\nof the Federal government, and to render it inefficient in its general\r\nobjects, and more especially in pecuniary and foreign concerns. The\r\nwant, too, of a separation of the Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary\r\nfunctions, worked disadvantageously in practice. Yet this state of\r\nthings afforded a happy augury of the future march of our Confederacy,\r\nwhen it was seen that the good sense and good dispositions of the\r\npeople, as soon as they perceived the incompetence of their first\r\ncompact, instead of leaving its correction to insurrection and civil\r\nwar, agreed, with one voice, to elect deputies to a general Convention,\r\nwho should peaceably meet and agree on such a Constitution as \"would\r\nensure peace, justice, liberty, the common defence and general\r\nwelfare.\"\r\n\r\nThis Convention met at Philadelphia on the 25th of May, '87. It sat\r\nwith closed doors, and kept all its proceedings secret, until its\r\ndissolution on the 17th of September, when the results of its labors\r\nwere published all together. I received a copy, early in November, and\r\nread and contemplated its provisions with great satisfaction. As not\r\na member of the Convention, however, nor probably a single citizen of\r\nthe Union, had approved it in all its parts, so I, too, found articles\r\nwhich I thought objectionable. The absence of express declarations\r\nensuring freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of the\r\nperson under the uninterrupted protection of the Habeas corpus,\r\nand trial by jury in Civil as well as in Criminal cases, excited my\r\njealousy; and the re-eligibility of the President for life, I quite\r\ndisapproved. I expressed freely, in letters to my friends, and most\r\nparticularly to Mr. Madison and General Washington, my approbations\r\nand objections. How the good should be secured and the ill brought\r\nto rights, was the difficulty. To refer it back to a new Convention\r\nmight endanger the loss of the whole. My first idea was, that the\r\nnine States first acting, should accept it unconditionally, and thus\r\nsecure what in it was good, and that the four last should accept on\r\nthe previous condition, that certain amendments should be agreed to;\r\nbut a better course was devised, of accepting the whole, and trusting\r\nthat the good sense and honest intentions of our citizens, would make\r\nthe alterations which should be deemed necessary. Accordingly, all\r\naccepted, six without objection, and seven with recommendations of\r\nspecified amendments. Those respecting the press, religion, and juries,\r\nwith several others, of great value, were accordingly made; but the\r\nHabeas corpus was left to the discretion of Congress, and the amendment\r\nagainst the re-eligibility of the President was not proposed. My fears\r\nof that feature were founded on the importance of the office, on the\r\nfierce contentions it might excite among ourselves, if continuable\r\nfor life, and the dangers of interference, either with money or arms,\r\nby foreign nations, to whom the choice of an American President might\r\nbecome interesting. Examples of this abounded in history; in the\r\ncase of the Roman Emperors, for instance; of the Popes, while of any\r\nsignificance; of the German Emperors; the Kings of Poland, and the\r\nDeys of Barbary. I had observed, too, in the feudal history, and in\r\nthe recent instance, particularly, of the Stadtholder of Holland,\r\nhow easily offices, or tenures for life, slide into inheritances. My\r\nwish, therefore, was, that the President should be elected for seven\r\nyears, and be ineligible afterwards. This term I thought sufficient to\r\nenable him, with the concurrence of the Legislature, to carry through\r\nand establish any system of improvement he should propose for the\r\ngeneral good. But the practice adopted, I think, is better, allowing\r\nhis continuance for eight years, with a liability to be dropped at\r\nhalf way of the term, making that a period of probation. That his\r\ncontinuance should be restrained to seven years, was the opinion of\r\nthe Convention at an earlier stage of its session, when it voted that\r\nterm, by a majority of eight against two, and by a simple majority\r\nthat he should be ineligible a second time. This opinion was confirmed\r\nby the House so late as July 26, referred to the Committee of detail,\r\nreported favorably by them, and changed to the present form by final\r\nvote, on the last day but one only of their session. Of this change,\r\nthree States expressed their disapprobation; New York, by recommending\r\nan amendment, that the President should not be eligible a third\r\ntime, and Virginia and North Carolina that he should not be capable\r\nof serving more than eight, in any term of sixteen years; and though\r\nthis amendment has not been made in form, yet practice seems to have\r\nestablished it. The example of four Presidents voluntarily retiring\r\nat the end of their eighth year, and the progress of public opinion,\r\nthat the principle is salutary, have given it in practice the force of\r\nprecedent and usage; insomuch, that, should a President consent to be\r\na candidate for a third election, I trust he would be rejected, on this\r\ndemonstration of ambitious views.\r\n\r\nBut there was another amendment, of which none of us thought at the\r\ntime, and in the omission of which, lurks the germ that is to destroy\r\nthis happy combination of National powers in the General government,\r\nfor matters of National concern, and independent powers in the States,\r\nfor what concerns the States severally. In England, it was a great\r\npoint gained at the Revolution, that the commissions of the Judges,\r\nwhich had hitherto been during pleasure, should thenceforth be made\r\nduring good behavior. A Judiciary, dependent on the will of the King,\r\nhad proved itself the most oppressive of all tools, in the hands of\r\nthat Magistrate. Nothing, then, could be more salutary, than a change\r\nthere, to the tenure of good behavior; and the question of good\r\nbehavior, left to the vote of a simple majority in the two Houses of\r\nParliament. Before the Revolution, we were all good English Whigs,\r\ncordial in their free principles, and in their jealousies of their\r\nExecutive Magistrate. These jealousies are very apparent, in all our\r\nstate Constitutions; and, in the General government in this instance,\r\nwe have gone even beyond the English caution, by requiring a vote\r\nof two-thirds, in one of the Houses, for removing a Judge; a vote\r\nso impossible, where[22] any defence is made, before men of ordinary\r\nprejudices and passions, that our Judges are effectually independent\r\nof the nation. But this ought not to be. I would not, indeed, make them\r\ndependent on the Executive authority, as they formerly were in England;\r\nbut I deem it indispensable to the continuance of this government,\r\nthat they should be submitted to some practical and impartial control;\r\nand that this, to be imparted, must be compounded of a mixture of\r\nState and Federal authorities. It is not enough that honest men are\r\nappointed Judges. All know the influence of interest on the mind of\r\nman, and how unconsciously his judgment is warped by that influence.\r\nTo this bias add that of the _esprit de corps_, of their peculiar\r\nmaxim and creed, that \"it is the office of a good Judge to enlarge his\r\njurisdiction,\" and the absence of responsibility; and how can we expect\r\nimpartial decision between the General government, of which they are\r\nthemselves so eminent a part, and an individual State, from which they\r\nhave nothing to hope or fear? We have seen, too, that contrary to all\r\ncorrect example, they are in the habit of going out of the question\r\nbefore them, to throw an anchor ahead, and grapple further hold for\r\nfuture advances of power. They are then, in fact, the corps of sappers\r\nand miners, steadily working to undermine the independent rights of the\r\nStates, and to consolidate all power in the hands of that government in\r\nwhich they have so important a freehold estate. But it is not by the\r\nconsolidation, or concentration of powers, but by their distribution,\r\nthat good government is effected. Were not this great country already\r\ndivided into States, that division must be made, that each might do for\r\nitself what concerns itself directly, and what it can so much better do\r\nthan a distant authority. Every State again is divided into counties,\r\neach to take care of what lies within its local bounds; each county\r\nagain into townships or wards, to manage minuter details; and every\r\nward into farms, to be governed each by its individual proprietor.\r\nWere we directed from Washington when to sow, and when to reap, we\r\nshould soon want bread. It is by this partition of cares, descending\r\nin gradation from general to particular, that the mass of human affairs\r\nmay be best managed, for the good and prosperity of all. I repeat, that\r\nI do not charge the Judges with wilful and ill-intentioned error; but\r\nhonest error must be arrested, where its toleration leads to public\r\nruin. As, for the safety of society, we commit honest maniacs to\r\nBedlam, so judges should be withdrawn from their bench, whose erroneous\r\nbiases are leading us to dissolution. It may, indeed, injure them in\r\nfame or in fortune; but it saves the Republic, which is the first and\r\nsupreme law.\r\n\r\nAmong the debilities of the government of the Confederation, no one was\r\nmore distinguished or more distressing, than the utter impossibility\r\nof obtaining, from the States, the moneys necessary for the payment\r\nof debts, or even for the ordinary expenses of the government. Some\r\ncontributed a little, some less, and some nothing; and the last\r\nfurnished at length an excuse for the first to do nothing also. Mr.\r\nAdams, while residing at the Hague, had a general authority to borrow\r\nwhat sums might be requisite, for ordinary and necessary expenses.\r\nInterest on the public debt, and the maintenance of the diplomatic\r\nestablishment in Europe, had been habitually provided in this way.\r\nHe was now elected Vice-President of the United States, was soon to\r\nreturn to America, and had referred our bankers to me for future\r\ncounsel, on our affairs in their hands. But I had no powers, no\r\ninstructions, no means, and no familiarity with the subject. It had\r\nalways been exclusively under his management, except as to occasional\r\nand partial deposits in the hands of Mr. Grand, banker in Paris, for\r\nspecial and local purposes. These last had been exhausted for some\r\ntime, and I had fervently pressed the Treasury board to replenish\r\nthis particular deposit, as Mr. Grand now refused to make further\r\nadvances. They answered candidly, that no funds could be obtained\r\nuntil the new government should get into action, and have time to make\r\nits arrangements. Mr. Adams had received his appointment to the court\r\nof London, while engaged at Paris, with Dr. Franklin and myself, in\r\nthe negotiations under our joint commissions. He had repaired thence\r\nto London, without returning to the Hague, to take leave of that\r\ngovernment. He thought it necessary, however, to do so now, before\r\nhe should leave Europe, and accordingly went there. I learned his\r\ndeparture from London, by a letter from Mrs. Adams, received on the\r\nvery day on which he would arrive at the Hague. A consultation with\r\nhim, and some provision for the future, was indispensable, while we\r\ncould yet avail ourselves of his powers; for when they would be gone,\r\nwe should be without resource. I was daily dunned by a Company who\r\nhad formerly made a small loan to the United States, the principal of\r\nwhich was now become due; and our bankers in Amsterdam, had notified\r\nme that the interest on our general debt would be expected in June;\r\nthat if we failed to pay it, it would be deemed an act of bankruptcy,\r\nand would effectually destroy the credit of the United States, and all\r\nfuture prospect of obtaining money there; that the loan they had been\r\nauthorized to open, of which a third only was filled, had now ceased\r\nto get forward, and rendered desperate that hope of resource. I saw\r\nthat there was not a moment to lose, and set out for the Hague on the\r\nsecond morning after receiving the information of Mr. Adams's journey.\r\nI went the direct road by Louvres, Senlis, Roye, Pont St. Maxence,\r\nBois le duc, Gournay, Peronne, Cambray, Bouchain, Valenciennes,\r\nMons, Bruxelles, Malines, Antwerp, Mordick, and Rotterdam, to the\r\nHague, where I happily found Mr. Adams. He concurred with me at once\r\nin opinion, that something must be done, and that we ought to risk\r\nourselves on doing it without instructions, to save the credit of the\r\nUnited States. We foresaw, that before the new government could be\r\nadopted, assembled, establish its financial system, get the money into\r\nthe Treasury, and place it in Europe, considerable time would elapse;\r\nthat, therefore, we had better provide at once, for the years '88, '89,\r\nand '90, in order to place our government at its ease, and our credit\r\nin security, during that trying interval. We set out, therefore, by\r\nthe way of Leyden, for Amsterdam, where we arrived on the 10th. I had\r\nprepared an estimate, showing that\r\n\r\n                                                Florins.\r\n\r\n      There would be necessary for the year '88--531,937-10\r\n                                            '89--538,540\r\n                                            '90--473,540\r\n                                               ------------\r\n                                    Total,     1,544,017-10\r\n                                 Florins.\r\n     To meet this,\r\n       the bankers had in hand, 79,268-2-8\r\n     and the unsold bonds\r\n       would yield,            542,800           622,068-2-8\r\n                               -------           -----------\r\n     Leaving a deficit of                        921,949-7-4\r\n     We proposed then to borrow a million,\r\n       yielding                                  920,000\r\n                                                -----------\r\n     Which would leave a small deficiency of       1,949-7-4\r\n\r\nMr. Adams accordingly executed 1000 bonds, for 1000 florins each, and\r\ndeposited them in the hands of our bankers, with instructions, however,\r\nnot to issue them until Congress should ratify the measure. This done,\r\nhe returned to London, and I set out for Paris; and, as nothing urgent\r\nforbade it, I determined to return along the banks of the Rhine, to\r\nStrasburg, and thence strike off to Paris. I accordingly left Amsterdam\r\non the 30th of March, and proceeded by Utrecht, Nimeguen, Cleves,\r\nDuysberg, Dusseldorf, Cologne, Bonne, Coblentz, Nassau, Hocheim,\r\nFrankfort, and made an excursion to Hanau, thence to Mayence, and\r\nanother excursion to Rudesheim, and Johansberg; then by Oppenheim,\r\nWorms, and Manheim, making an excursion to Heidelberg, then by Spire,\r\nCarlsruh, Rastadt and Kelh, to Strasburg, where I arrived April the\r\n16th, and proceeded again on the 18th, by Phalsbourg, Fenestrange,\r\nDieuze, Moyenvie, Nancy, Toul, Ligny, Barleduc, St. Diziers, Vitry,\r\nChalons sur Marne, Epernay, Chateau Thierri, Meaux, to Paris, where I\r\narrived on the 23d of April; and I had the satisfaction to reflect,\r\nthat by this journey our credit was secured, the new government was\r\nplaced at ease for two years to come, and that, as well as myself,\r\nrelieved from the torment of incessant duns, whose just complaints\r\ncould not be silenced by any means within our power.\r\n\r\nA Consular Convention had been agreed on in '84, between Dr. Franklin\r\nand the French government, containing several articles, so entirely\r\ninconsistent with the laws of the several States, and the general\r\nspirit of our citizens, that Congress withheld their ratification, and\r\nsent it back to me, with instructions to get those articles expunged,\r\nor modified so as to render them compatible with our laws. The Minister\r\nunwillingly released us from these concessions, which, indeed,\r\nauthorized the exercise of powers very offensive in a free State.\r\nAfter much discussion, the Convention was reformed in a considerable\r\ndegree, and was signed by the Count Montmorin and myself, on the 14th\r\nof November, '88; not, indeed, such as I would have wished, but such as\r\ncould be obtained with good humor and friendship.\r\n\r\nOn my return from Holland, I found Paris as I had left it, still in\r\nhigh fermentation. Had the Archbishop, on the close of the Assembly of\r\nNotables, immediately carried into operation the measures contemplated,\r\nit was believed they would all have been registered by the Parliament;\r\nbut he was slow, presented his edicts, one after another, and at\r\nconsiderable intervals, which gave time for the feelings excited by the\r\nproceedings of the Notables to cool off, new claims to be advanced, and\r\na pressure to arise for a fixed constitution, not subject to changes\r\nat the will of the King. Nor should we wonder at this pressure, when\r\nwe consider the monstrous abuses of power under which this people\r\nwere ground to powder; when we pass in review the weight of their\r\ntaxes, and the inequality of their distribution; the oppressions of\r\nthe tithes, the tailles, the corvees, the gabelles, the farms and\r\nthe barriers; the shackles on commerce by monopolies; on industry by\r\nguilds and corporations; on the freedom of conscience, of thought,\r\nand of speech; on the freedom of the press by the Censure; and of\r\nthe person by Lettres de Cachet; the cruelty of the Criminal code\r\ngenerally; the atrocities of the Rack; the venality of the Judges,\r\nand their partialities to the rich; the monopoly of Military honors\r\nby the Noblesse; the enormous expenses of the Queen, the Princes and\r\nthe Court; the prodigalities of pensions; and the riches, luxury,\r\nindolence and immorality of the Clergy. Surely under such a mass of\r\nmisrule and oppression, a people might justly press for a thorough\r\nreformation, and might even dismount their rough-shod riders, and\r\nleave them to walk on their own legs. The edicts, relative to the\r\ncorvees and free circulation of grain, were first presented to the\r\nParliament and registered; but those for the impôt territorial, and\r\nstamp tax, offered some time after, were refused by the Parliament,\r\nwhich proposed a call of the States General, as alone competent to\r\ntheir authorization. Their refusal produced a Bed of justice, and\r\ntheir exile to Troyes. The Advocates, however, refusing to attend\r\nthem, a suspension in the administration of justice took place. The\r\nParliament held out for awhile, but the ennui of their exile and\r\nabsence from Paris, began at length to be felt, and some dispositions\r\nfor compromise to appear. On their consent, therefore, to prolong some\r\nof the former taxes, they were recalled from exile, the King met them\r\nin session, November 19, '87, promised to call the States General in\r\nthe year '92, and a majority expressed their assent to register an\r\nedict for successive and annual loans from 1788 to '92; but a protest\r\nbeing entered by the Duke of Orleans, and this encouraging others in a\r\ndisposition to retract, the King ordered peremptorily the registry of\r\nthe edict, and left the assembly abruptly. The Parliament immediately\r\nprotested, that the votes for the enregistry had not been legally\r\ntaken, and that they gave no sanction to the loans proposed. This was\r\nenough to discredit and defeat them. Hereupon issued another edict,\r\nfor the establishment of a cour plenière, and the suspension of all the\r\nParliaments in the kingdom. This being opposed, as might be expected,\r\nby reclamations from all the Parliaments and Provinces, the King gave\r\nway, and by an edict of July 5th, '88, renounced his cour plenière, and\r\npromised the States General for the 1st of May, of the ensuing year;\r\nand the Archbishop, finding the times beyond his faculties, accepted\r\nthe promise of a Cardinal's hat, was removed [September '88] from the\r\nMinistry, and M. Necker was called to the department of finance. The\r\ninnocent rejoicings of the people of Paris on this change provoked the\r\ninterference of an officer of the city guards, whose order for their\r\ndispersion not being obeyed, he charged them with fixed bayonets,\r\nkilled two or three, and wounded many. This dispersed them for the\r\nmoment, but they collected the next day in great numbers, burnt ten or\r\ntwelve guardhouses, killed two or three of the guards, and lost six or\r\neight more of their own number. The city was hereupon put under Martial\r\nlaw, and after awhile the tumult subsided. The effect of this change\r\nof ministers, and the promise of the States General at an early day,\r\ntranquillized the nation. But two great questions now occurred. 1st.\r\nWhat proportion shall the number of deputies of the Tiers etat bear to\r\nthose of the Nobles and Clergy? And 2d, shall they sit in the same or\r\nin distinct apartments? M. Necker, desirous of avoiding himself these\r\nknotty questions, proposed a second call of the same Notables, and that\r\ntheir advice should be asked on the subject. They met, November 9, '88;\r\nand, by five bureaux against one, they recommended the forms of the\r\nStates General of 1614; wherein the Houses were separate, and voted by\r\norders, not by persons. But the whole nation declaring at once against\r\nthis, and that the Tiers etat should be, in numbers, equal to both the\r\nother orders, and the Parliament deciding for the same proportion,\r\nit was determined so to be, by a declaration of December 27th, '88.\r\nA Report of M. Necker, to the King, of about the same date, contained\r\nother very important concessions. 1. That the King could neither lay\r\na new tax, nor prolong an old one. 2. It expressed a readiness to\r\nagree on the periodical meeting of the States. 3. To consult on the\r\nnecessary restriction on Lettres de Cachet; and 4. How far the press\r\nmight be made free. 5. It admits that the States are to appropriate\r\nthe public money; and 6. That Ministers shall be responsible for\r\npublic expenditures. And these concessions came from the very heart\r\nof the King. He had not a wish but for the good of the nation; and\r\nfor that object, no personal sacrifice would ever have cost him a\r\nmoment's regret; but his mind was weakness itself, his constitution\r\ntimid, his judgment null, and without sufficient firmness even to\r\nstand by the faith of his word. His Queen, too, haughty and bearing\r\nno contradiction, had an absolute ascendancy over him; and around her\r\nwere rallied the King's brother d'Artois, the court generally, and the\r\naristocratic part of his Ministers, particularly Breteuil, Broglio,\r\nVauguyon, Foulon, Luzerne, men whose principles of government were\r\nthose of the age of Louis XIV. Against this host, the good counsels\r\nof Necker, Montmorin, St. Priest, although in unison with the wishes\r\nof the King himself, were of little avail. The resolutions of the\r\nmorning, formed under their advice, would be reversed in the evening,\r\nby the influence of the Queen and court. But the hand of heaven weighed\r\nheavily indeed on the machinations of this junto; producing collateral\r\nincidents, not arising out of the case, yet powerfully co-exciting\r\nthe nation to force a regeneration of its government, and overwhelming\r\nwith accumulated difficulties, this liberticide resistance. For, while\r\nlaboring under the want of money for even ordinary purposes, in a\r\ngovernment which required a million of livres a day, and driven to the\r\nlast ditch by the universal call for liberty, there came on a winter\r\nof such severe cold, as was without example in the memory of man, or\r\nin the written records of history. The Mercury was at times 50° below\r\nthe freezing point of Fahrenheit, and 22° below that of Reaumur. All\r\nout-door labor was suspended, and the poor, without the wages of labor,\r\nwere, of course, without either bread or fuel. The government found\r\nits necessities aggravated by that of procuring immense quantities of\r\nfire-wood, and of keeping great fires at all the cross streets, around\r\nwhich the people gathered in crowds, to avoid perishing with cold.\r\nBread, too, was to be bought, and distributed daily, gratis, until\r\na relaxation of the season should enable the people to work; and the\r\nslender stock of bread stuff had for some time threatened famine, and\r\nhad raised that article to an enormous price. So great, indeed, was the\r\nscarcity of bread, that, from the highest to the lowest citizen, the\r\nbakers were permitted to deal but a scanty allowance per head, even\r\nto those who paid for it; and, in cards of invitation to dine in the\r\nrichest houses, the guest was notified to bring his own bread. To eke\r\nout the existence of the people, every person who had the means, was\r\ncalled on for a weekly subscription, which the Curés collected, and\r\nemployed in providing messes for the nourishment of the poor, and vied\r\nwith each other in devising such economical compositions of food, as\r\nwould subsist the greatest number with the smallest means. This want\r\nof bread had been foreseen for some time past, and M. de Montmorin had\r\ndesired me to notify it in America, and that, in addition to the market\r\nprice, a premium should be given on what should be brought from the\r\nUnited States. Notice was accordingly given, and produced considerable\r\nsupplies. Subsequent information made the importations from America,\r\nduring the months of March, April and May, into the Atlantic ports of\r\nFrance, amount to about twenty-one thousand barrels of flour, besides\r\nwhat went to other ports, and in other months; while our supplies to\r\ntheir West Indian islands relieved them also from that drain. This\r\ndistress for bread continued till July.\r\n\r\nHitherto no acts of popular violence had been produced by the struggle\r\nfor political reformation. Little riots, on ordinary incidents, had\r\ntaken place as at other times, in different parts of the kingdom, in\r\nwhich some lives, perhaps a dozen or twenty, had been lost; but in the\r\nmonth of April, a more serious one occurred in Paris, unconnected,\r\nindeed, with the Revolutionary principle, but making part of the\r\nhistory of the day. The Fauxbourg St. Antoine is a quarter of the\r\ncity inhabited entirely by the class of day laborers and journeymen\r\nin every line. A rumor was spread among them, that a great paper\r\nmanufacturer, of the name of Reveillon, had proposed, on some occasion,\r\nthat their wages should be lowered to fifteen sous a day. Inflamed\r\nat once into rage, and without inquiring into its truth, they flew\r\nto his house in vast numbers, destroyed everything in it, and in his\r\nmagazines and work-shops, without secreting, however, a pin's worth\r\nto themselves, and were continuing this work of devastation, when the\r\nregular troops were called in. Admonitions being disregarded, they were\r\nof necessity fired on, and a regular action ensued, in which about one\r\nhundred of them were killed, before the rest would disperse. There\r\nhad rarely passed a year without such a riot, in some part or other\r\nof the Kingdom; and this is distinguished only as cotemporary with the\r\nRevolution, although not produced by it.\r\n\r\nThe States General were opened on the 5th of May, '89, by speeches from\r\nthe King, the Garde des Sceaux, Lamoignon, and M. Necker. The last\r\nwas thought to trip too lightly over the constitutional reformations\r\nwhich were expected. His notices of them in this speech, were not\r\nas full as in his previous 'Rapport au Roi.' This was observed, to\r\nhis disadvantage; but much allowance should have been made for the\r\nsituation in which he was placed, between his own counsels, and those\r\nof the ministers and party of the court. Overruled in his own opinions,\r\ncompelled to deliver, and to gloss over those of his opponents, and\r\neven to keep their secrets, he could not come forward in his own\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the Assembly, although equivalent, on the whole,\r\nto what had been expected, was something different in its elements. It\r\nhad been supposed, that a superior education would carry into the scale\r\nof the Commons a respectable portion of the Noblesse. It did so as to\r\nthose of Paris, of its vicinity, and of the other considerable cities,\r\nwhose greater intercourse with enlightened society had liberalized\r\ntheir minds, and prepared them to advance up to the measure of the\r\ntimes. But the Noblesse of the country, which constituted two-thirds\r\nof that body, were far in their rear. Residing constantly on their\r\npatrimonial feuds, and familiarized, by daily habit, with Seigneurial\r\npowers and practices, they had not yet learned to suspect their\r\ninconsistence with reason and right. They were willing to submit\r\nto equality of taxation, but not to descend from their rank and\r\nprerogatives to be incorporated in session with the Tiers etat. Among\r\nthe Clergy, on the other hand, it had been apprehended that the higher\r\norders of the Hierarchy, by their wealth and connections, would have\r\ncarried the elections generally; but it turned out, that in most cases,\r\nthe lower clergy had obtained the popular majorities. These consisted\r\nof the Curés, sons of the peasantry, who had been employed to do all\r\nthe drudgery of parochial services for ten, twenty, or thirty Louis a\r\nyear; while their superiors were consuming their princely revenues in\r\npalaces of luxury and indolence.\r\n\r\nThe objects for which this body was convened, being of the first order\r\nof importance, I felt it very interesting to understand the views\r\nof the parties of which it was composed, and especially the ideas\r\nprevalent as to the organization contemplated for their government.\r\nI went, therefore, daily from Paris to Versailles, and attended\r\ntheir debates, generally till the hour of adjournment. Those of the\r\nNoblesse were impassioned and tempestuous. They had some able men on\r\nboth sides, actuated by equal zeal. The debates of the Commons were\r\ntemperate, rational, and inflexibly firm. As preliminary to all other\r\nbusiness, the awful questions came on, shall the States sit in one,\r\nor in distinct apartments? And shall they vote by heads or houses?\r\nThe opposition was soon found to consist of the Episcopal order among\r\nthe clergy, and two-thirds of the Noblesse; while the Tiers etat\r\nwere, to a man, united and determined. After various propositions\r\nof compromise had failed, the Commons undertook to cut the Gordian\r\nknot. The Abbe Sieyes, the most logical head of the nation, (author\r\nof the pamphlet \"Qu'est ce que le Tiers etat?\" which had electrified\r\nthat country, as Paine's Common Sense did us,) after an impressive\r\nspeech on the 10th of June, moved that a last invitation should be\r\nsent to the Noblesse and Clergy, to attend in the hall of the States,\r\ncollectively or individually, for the verification of powers, to which\r\nthe Commons would proceed immediately, either in their presence or\r\nabsence. This verification being finished, a motion was made, on the\r\n15th, that they should constitute themselves a National Assembly;\r\nwhich was decided on the 17th, by a majority of four-fifths. During\r\nthe debates on this question, about twenty of the Curés had joined\r\nthem, and a proposition was made, in the chamber of the Clergy, that\r\ntheir whole body should join. This was rejected, at first, by a small\r\nmajority only; but, being afterwards somewhat modified, it was decided\r\naffirmatively, by a majority of eleven. While this was under debate,\r\nand unknown to the court, to wit, on the 19th, a council was held in\r\nthe afternoon, at Marly, wherein it was proposed that the King should\r\ninterpose, by a declaration of his sentiments, in a _seance royale_. A\r\nform of declaration was proposed by Necker, which, while it censured,\r\nin general, the proceedings, both of the Nobles and Commons, announced\r\nthe King's views, such as substantially to coincide with the Commons.\r\nIt was agreed to in Council, the _seance_ was fixed for the 22d, the\r\nmeetings of the States were till then to be suspended, and everything,\r\nin the meantime, kept secret. The members, the next morning (the\r\n20th) repairing to their house, as usual, found the doors shut and\r\nguarded, a proclamation posted up for a _seance royale_ on the 22d,\r\nand a suspension of their meetings in the meantime. Concluding that\r\ntheir dissolution was now to take place, they repaired to a building\r\ncalled the \"Jeu de paume\" (or Tennis court) and there bound themselves\r\nby oath to each other, never to separate, of their own accord, till\r\nthey had settled a constitution for the nation, on a solid basis,\r\nand, if separated by force, that they would reassemble in some other\r\nplace. The next day they met in the church of St. Louis, and were\r\njoined by a majority of the clergy. The heads of the Aristocracy saw\r\nthat all was lost without some bold exertion. The King was still at\r\nMarly. Nobody was permitted to approach him but their friends. He was\r\nassailed by falsehoods in all shapes. He was made to believe that the\r\nCommons were about to absolve the army from their oath of fidelity\r\nto him, and to raise their pay. The court party were now all rage\r\nand desperation. They procured a committee to be held, consisting of\r\nthe King and his Ministers, to which Monsieur and the Count d'Artois\r\nshould be admitted. At this committee, the latter attacked M. Necker\r\npersonally, arraigned his declaration, and proposed one which some of\r\nhis prompters had put into his hands. M. Necker was brow-beaten and\r\nintimidated, and the King shaken. He determined that the two plans\r\nshould be deliberated on the next day, and the _seance royale_ put\r\noff a day longer. This encouraged a fiercer attack on M. Necker the\r\nnext day. His draught of a declaration was entirely broken up, and\r\nthat of the Count d'Artois inserted into it. Himself and Montmorin\r\noffered their resignation, which was refused; the Count d'Artois saying\r\nto M. Necker, \"No sir, you must be kept as the hostage; we hold you\r\nresponsible for all the ill which shall happen.\" This change of plan\r\nwas immediately whispered without doors. The Noblesse were in triumph;\r\nthe people in consternation. I was quite alarmed at this state of\r\nthings. The soldiery had not yet indicated which side they should\r\ntake, and that which they should support would be sure to prevail.\r\nI considered a successful reformation of government in France, as\r\ninsuring a general reformation through Europe, and the resurrection,\r\nto a new life, of their people, now ground to dust by the abuses of\r\nthe governing powers. I was much acquainted with the leading patriots\r\nof the Assembly. Being from a country which had successfully passed\r\nthrough a similar reformation, they were disposed to my acquaintance,\r\nand had some confidence in me. I urged, most strenuously, an immediate\r\ncompromise; to secure what the government was now ready to yield,\r\nand trust to future occasions for what might still be wanting. It was\r\nwell understood that the King would grant, at this time, 1. Freedom\r\nof the person by Habeas corpus: 2. Freedom of conscience: 3. Freedom\r\nof the press: 4. Trial by jury: 5. A representative Legislature: 6.\r\nAnnual meetings: 7. The origination of laws: 8. The exclusive right of\r\ntaxation and appropriation: and 9. The responsibility of Ministers;\r\nand with the exercise of these powers they could obtain, in future,\r\nwhatever might be further necessary to improve and preserve their\r\nconstitution. They thought otherwise, however, and events have proved\r\ntheir lamentable error. For, after thirty years of war, foreign and\r\ndomestic, the loss of millions of lives, the prostration of private\r\nhappiness, and the foreign subjugation of their own country for a\r\ntime, they have obtained no more, nor even that securely. They were\r\nunconscious of (for who could foresee?) the melancholy sequel of\r\ntheir well-meant perseverance; that their physical force would be\r\nusurped by a first tyrant to trample on the independence, and even the\r\nexistence, of other nations: that this would afford a fatal example\r\nfor the atrocious conspiracy of Kings against their people; would\r\ngenerate their unholy and homicide alliance to make common cause among\r\nthemselves, and to crush, by the power of the whole, the efforts of any\r\npart to moderate their abuses and oppressions.\r\n\r\nWhen the King passed, the next day, through the lane formed from the\r\nChateau to the \"Hotel des etats,\" there was a dead silence. He was\r\nabout an hour in the House, delivering his speech and declaration.\r\nOn his coming out, a feeble cry of \"vive le Roi\" was raised by some\r\nchildren, but the people remained silent and sullen. In the close of\r\nhis speech, he had ordered that the members should follow him, and\r\nresume their deliberations the next day. The Noblesse followed him, and\r\nso did the Clergy, except about thirty, who, with the Tiers, remained\r\nin the room, and entered into deliberation. They protested against\r\nwhat the King had done, adhered to all their former proceedings, and\r\nresolved the inviolability of their own persons. An officer came, to\r\norder them out of the room in the King's name. \"Tell those who sent\r\nyou,\" said Mirabeau, \"that we shall not move hence but at our own will,\r\nor the point of the bayonet.\" In the afternoon, the people, uneasy,\r\nbegan to assemble in great numbers in the courts, and vicinities of\r\nthe palace. This produced alarm. The Queen sent for M. Necker. He was\r\nconducted, amidst the shouts and acclamations of the multitude, who\r\nfilled all the apartments of the palace. He was a few minutes only\r\nwith the Queen, and what passed between them did not transpire. The\r\nKing went out to ride. He passed through the crowd to his carriage, and\r\ninto it, without being in the least noticed. As M. Necker followed him,\r\nuniversal acclamations were raised of \"vive Monsieur Necker, vive le\r\nsauveur de la France opprimée.\" He was conducted back to his house with\r\nthe same demonstrations of affection and anxiety. About two hundred\r\ndeputies of the Tiers, catching the enthusiasm of the moment, went to\r\nhis house, and extorted from him a promise that he would not resign.\r\nOn the 25th, forty-eight of the Nobles joined the Tiers, and among\r\nthem the Duke of Orleans. There were then with them one hundred and\r\nsixty-four members of the Clergy, although the minority of that body\r\nstill sat apart, and called themselves the Chamber of the Clergy. On\r\nthe 26th, the Archbishop of Paris joined the Tiers, as did some others\r\nof the Clergy and of the Noblesse.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings had thrown the people into violent ferment. It gained\r\nthe soldiery, first of the French guards, extended to those of every\r\nother denomination, except the Swiss, and even to the body guards of\r\nthe King. They began to quit their barracks, to assemble in squads, to\r\ndeclare they would defend the life of the King, but would not be the\r\nmurderers of their fellow-citizens. They called themselves the soldiers\r\n_of the nation_, and left now no doubt on which side they would be,\r\nin case of rupture. Similar accounts came in from the troops in other\r\nparts of the kingdom, giving good reason to believe they would side\r\nwith their fathers and brothers, rather than with their officers.\r\nThe operation of this medicine at Versailles was as sudden as it was\r\npowerful. The alarm there was so complete, that in the afternoon of\r\nthe 27th, the King wrote, with his own hand, letters to the Presidents\r\nof the Clergy and Nobles, engaging them immediately to join the Tiers.\r\nThese two bodies were debating, and hesitating, when notes from the\r\nCount d'Artois decided their compliance. They went in a body, and took\r\ntheir seats with the Tiers, and thus rendered the union of the orders\r\nin one chamber complete.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly now entered on the business of their mission, and first\r\nproceeded to arrange the order in which they would take up the heads of\r\ntheir constitution, as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, and as Preliminary to the whole, a general Declaration of the\r\nRights of Man. Then, specifically, the Principles of the Monarchy;\r\nRights of the Nation; rights of the King; rights of the Citizens;\r\norganization and rights of the National Assembly; forms necessary for\r\nthe enactment of Laws; organization and functions of the Provincial\r\nand Municipal Assemblies; duties and limits of the Judiciary power;\r\nfunctions and duties of the Military power.\r\n\r\nA Declaration of the Rights of Man, as the preliminary of their work,\r\nwas accordingly prepared and proposed by the Marquis de La Fayette.\r\n\r\nBut the quiet of their march was soon disturbed by information that\r\ntroops, and particularly the foreign troops, were advancing on Paris\r\nfrom various quarters. The King had probably been advised to this,\r\non the pretext of preserving peace in Paris. But his advisers were\r\nbelieved to have other things in contemplation. The Marshal de Broglio\r\nwas appointed to their command, a high-flying aristocrat, cool and\r\ncapable of everything. Some of the French guards were soon arrested,\r\nunder other pretexts, but really, on account of their dispositions in\r\nfavor of the National cause. The people of Paris forced their prison,\r\nliberated them, and sent a deputation to the Assembly to solicit a\r\npardon. The Assembly recommended peace and order to the people of\r\nParis, the prisoners to the King, and asked from him the removal of\r\nthe troops. His answer was negative and dry, saying they might remove\r\nthemselves, if they pleased, to Noyons or Soissons. In the meantime,\r\nthese troops, to the number of twenty or thirty thousand, had arrived,\r\nand were posted in, and between Paris and Versailles. The bridges and\r\npasses were guarded. At three o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th\r\nof July, the Count de La Luzerne was sent to notify M. Necker of his\r\ndismission, and to enjoin him to retire instantly, without saying a\r\nword of it to anybody. He went home, dined, and proposed to his wife a\r\nvisit to a friend, but went in fact to his country house at St. Ouen,\r\nand at midnight set out for Brussels. This was not known till the next\r\nday (the 12th,) when the whole Ministry was changed, except Villedeuil,\r\nof the domestic department, and Barenton, Garde des sceaux. The changes\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Baron de Breteuil, President of the Council of Finance; de la\r\nGalaisiere, Comptroller General, in the room of M. Necker; the Marshal\r\nde Broglio, Minister of War, and Foulon under him, in the room of\r\nPuy-Segur; the Duke de la Vauguyon, Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\ninstead of the Count de Montmorin; de La Porte, Minister of Marine, in\r\nplace of the Count de La Luzerne; St. Priest was also removed from the\r\nCouncil. Luzerne and Puy-Segur had been strongly of the Aristocratic\r\nparty in the Council, but they were not considered equal to the work\r\nnow to be done. The King was now completely in the hands of men,\r\nthe principal among whom had been noted, through their lives, for\r\nthe Turkish despotism of their characters, and who were associated\r\naround the King, as proper instruments for what was to be executed.\r\nThe news of this change began to be known at Paris, about one or two\r\no'clock. In the afternoon, a body of about one hundred German cavalry\r\nwere advanced, and drawn up in the Place Louis XV., and about two\r\nhundred Swiss posted at a little distance in their rear. This drew\r\npeople to the spot, who thus accidentally found themselves in front\r\nof the troops, merely at first as spectators; but, as their numbers\r\nincreased, their indignation rose. They retired a few steps, and\r\nposted themselves on and behind large piles of stones, large and small,\r\ncollected in that place for a bridge, which was to be built adjacent\r\nto it. In this position, happening to be in my carriage on a visit,\r\nI passed through the lane they had formed, without interruption. But\r\nthe moment after I had passed, the people attacked the cavalry with\r\nstones. They charged, but the advantageous position of the people, and\r\nthe showers of stones, obliged the horse to retire, and quit the field\r\naltogether, leaving one of their number on the ground, and the Swiss\r\nin the rear not moving to their aid. This was the signal for universal\r\ninsurrection, and this body of cavalry, to avoid being massacred,\r\nretired towards Versailles. The people now armed themselves with such\r\nweapons as they could find in armorer's shops, and private houses,\r\nand with bludgeons; and were roaming all night, through all parts of\r\nthe city, without any decided object. The next day (the 13th,) the\r\nAssembly pressed on the King to send away the troops, to permit the\r\nBourgeoisie of Paris to arm for the preservation of order in the city,\r\nand offered to send a deputation from their body to tranquillize them;\r\nbut their propositions were refused. A committee of magistrates and\r\nelectors of the city were appointed by those bodies, to take upon them\r\nits government. The people, now openly joined by the French guards,\r\nforced the prison of St. Lazare, released all the prisoners, and took\r\na great store of corn, which they carried to the corn-market. Here they\r\ngot some arms, and the French guards began to form and train them. The\r\ncity-committee determined to raise forty-eight thousand Bourgeoise,\r\nor rather to restrain their numbers to forty-eight thousand. On the\r\n14th, they sent one of their members (Monsieur de Corny) to the Hotel\r\ndes Invalides, to ask arms for their Garde Bourgeoise. He was followed\r\nby, and he found there, a great collection of people. The Governor\r\nof the Invalids came out, and represented the impossibility of his\r\ndelivering arms, without the orders of those from whom he received\r\nthem. De Corny advised the people then to retire, and retired himself;\r\nbut the people took possession of the arms. It was remarkable, that\r\nnot only the Invalids themselves made no opposition, but that a body\r\nof five thousand foreign troops, within four hundred yards, never\r\nstirred. M. de Corny, and five others, were then sent to ask arms of M.\r\nde Launay, Governor of the Bastile. They found a great collection of\r\npeople already before the place, and they immediately planted a flag\r\nof truce, which was answered by a like flag hoisted on the parapet.\r\nThe deputation prevailed on the people to fall back a little, advanced\r\nthemselves to make their demand of the Governor, and in that instant,\r\na discharge from the Bastile killed four persons of those nearest to\r\nthe deputies. The deputies retired. I happened to be at the house of\r\nM. de Corny, when he returned to it, and received from him a narrative\r\nof these transactions. On the retirement of the deputies, the people\r\nrushed forward, and almost in an instant, were in possession of a\r\nfortification of infinite strength, defended by one hundred men, which\r\nin other times had stood several regular sieges, and had never been\r\ntaken. How they forced their entrance has never been explained. They\r\ntook all the arms, discharged the prisoners, and such of the garrison\r\nas were not killed in the first moment of fury; carried the Governor\r\nand Lieutenant Governor, to the Place de Grève, (the place of public\r\nexecution,) cut off their heads, and sent them through the city, in\r\ntriumph, to the Palais royal. About the same instant, a treacherous\r\ncorrespondence having been discovered in M. de Flesselles, Prevôt\r\ndes Marchands, they seized him in the Hotel de Ville, where he was\r\nin the execution of his office, and cut off his head. These events,\r\ncarried imperfectly to Versailles, were the subject of two successive\r\ndeputations from the Assembly to the King, to both of which he gave dry\r\nand hard answers; for nobody had as yet been permitted to inform him,\r\ntruly and fully, of what had passed at Paris. But at night, the Duke\r\nde Liancourt forced his way into the King's bed chamber, and obliged\r\nhim to hear a full and animated detail of the disasters of the day\r\nin Paris. He went to bed fearfully impressed. The decapitation of de\r\nLaunay worked powerfully through the night on the whole Aristocratic\r\nparty; insomuch, that in the morning, those of the greatest influence\r\non the Count d'Artois, represented to him the absolute necessity that\r\nthe King should give up everything to the Assembly. This according with\r\nthe dispositions of the King, he went about eleven o'clock, accompanied\r\nonly by his brothers, to the Assembly, and there read to them a\r\nspeech, in which he asked their interposition to re-establish order.\r\nAlthough couched in terms of some caution, yet the manner in which\r\nit was delivered, made it evident that it was meant as a surrender\r\nat discretion. He returned to the Chateau a foot, accompanied by the\r\nAssembly. They sent off a deputation to quiet Paris, at the head of\r\nwhich was the Marquis de La Fayette, who had, the same morning, been\r\nnamed Commandant en chef of the Milice Bourgeoise; and Monsieur Bailly,\r\nformer President of the States General, was called for as Prevôt des\r\nMarchands. The demolition of the Bastile was now ordered and begun. A\r\nbody of the Swiss guards, of the regiment of Ventimille, and the city\r\nhorse guards joined the people. The alarm at Versailles increased. The\r\nforeign troops were ordered off instantly. Every Minister resigned.\r\nThe King confirmed Bailly as Prevôt des Marchands, wrote to M. Necker,\r\nto recall him, sent his letter open to the Assembly, to be forwarded\r\nby them, and invited them to go with him to Paris the next day, to\r\nsatisfy the city of his dispositions; and that night, and the next\r\nmorning, the Count d'Artois, and M. de Montesson, a deputy connected\r\nwith him, Madame de Polignac, Madame de Guiche, and the Count de\r\nVaudreuil, favorites of the Queen, the Abbe de Vermont her confessor,\r\nthe Prince of Conde, and Duke of Bourbon fled. The King came to Paris,\r\nleaving the Queen in consternation for his return. Omitting the less\r\nimportant figures of the procession, the King's carriage was in the\r\ncentre; on each side of it, the Assembly, in two ranks a foot; at their\r\nhead the Marquis de La Fayette, as Commander-in-chief, on horseback,\r\nand Bourgeois guards before and behind. About sixty thousand citizens,\r\nof all forms and conditions, armed with the conquests of the Bastile\r\nand Invalids, as far as they would go, the rest with pistols, swords,\r\npikes, pruning-hooks, scythes, &c., lined all the streets through which\r\nthe procession passed, and with the crowds of people in the streets,\r\ndoors, and windows, saluted them everywhere with the cries of \"vive\r\nla nation,\" but not a single \"vive le Roi\" was heard. The King stopped\r\nat the Hotel de Ville. There M. Bailly presented and put into his hat,\r\nthe popular cockade, and addressed him. The King being unprepared, and\r\nunable to answer, Bailly went to him, gathered from him some scraps of\r\nsentences, and made out an answer, which he delivered to the audience,\r\nas from the King. On their return, the popular cries were \"vive le Roi\r\net la nation.\" He was conducted by a garde Bourgeoise to his palace at\r\nVersailles, and thus concluded an \"amende honorable,\" as no sovereign\r\never made, and no people ever received.\r\n\r\nAnd here, again, was lost another precious occasion of sparing to\r\nFrance the crimes and cruelties through which she has since passed,\r\nand to Europe, and finally America, the evils which flowed on them\r\nalso from this mortal source. The King was now become a passive\r\nmachine in the hands of the National Assembly, and had he been left to\r\nhimself, he would have willingly acquiesced in whatever they should\r\ndevise as best for the nation. A wise constitution would have been\r\nformed, hereditary in his line, himself placed at its head, with\r\npowers so large as to enable him to do all the good of his station,\r\nand so limited, as to restrain him from its abuse. This he would\r\nhave faithfully administered, and more than this, I do not believe,\r\nhe ever wished. But he had a Queen of absolute sway over his weak\r\nmind and timid virtue, and of a character the reverse of his in all\r\npoints. This angel, as gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of Burke, with\r\nsome smartness of fancy, but no sound sense, was proud, disdainful\r\nof restraint, indignant at all obstacles to her will, eager in the\r\npursuit of pleasure, and firm enough to hold to her desires, or\r\nperish in their wreck. Her inordinate gambling and dissipations, with\r\nthose of the Count d'Artois, and others of her _clique_, had been a\r\nsensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury, which called into\r\naction the reforming hand of the nation; and her opposition to it,\r\nher inflexible perverseness, and dauntless spirit, led herself to the\r\nGuillotine, drew the King on with her, and plunged the world into\r\ncrimes and calamities which will forever stain the pages of modern\r\nhistory. I have ever believed, that had there been no Queen, there\r\nwould have been no revolution. No force would have been provoked, nor\r\nexercised. The King would have gone hand in hand with the wisdom of his\r\nsounder counsellors, who, guided by the increased lights of the age,\r\nwished only, with the same pace, to advance the principles of their\r\nsocial constitution. The deed which closed the mortal course of these\r\nsovereigns, I shall neither approve nor condemn. I am not prepared\r\nto say, that the first magistrate of a nation cannot commit treason\r\nagainst his country, or is unamenable to its punishment; nor yet, that\r\nwhere there is no written law, no regulated tribunal, there is not\r\na law in our hearts, and a power in our hands, given for righteous\r\nemployment in maintaining right, and redressing wrong. Of those who\r\njudged the King many thought him wilfully criminal; many, that his\r\nexistence would keep the nation in perpetual conflict with the horde\r\nof Kings who would war against a generation which might come home to\r\nthemselves, and that it were better that one should die than all. I\r\nshould not have voted with this portion of the legislature. I should\r\nhave shut up the Queen in a convent, putting harm out of her power,\r\nand placed the King in his station, investing him with limited powers,\r\nwhich, I verily believe, he would have honestly exercised, according\r\nto the measure of his understanding. In this way, no void would have\r\nbeen created, courting the usurpation of a military adventurer, nor\r\noccasion given for those enormities which demoralized the nations of\r\nthe world, and destroyed, and is yet to destroy, millions and millions\r\nof its inhabitants. There are three epochs in history, signalized\r\nby the total extinction of national morality. The first was of the\r\nsuccessors of Alexander, not omitting himself: The next, the successors\r\nof the first Cæsar: The third, our own age. This was begun by the\r\npartition of Poland, followed by that of the treaty of Pilnitz; next\r\nthe conflagration of Copenhagen; then the enormities of Bonaparte,\r\npartitioning the earth at his will, and devastating it with fire\r\nand sword; now the conspiracy of Kings, the successors of Bonaparte,\r\nblasphemously calling themselves the Holy Alliance, and treading in the\r\nfootsteps of their incarcerated leader; not yet, indeed, usurping the\r\ngovernment of other nations, avowedly and in detail, but controlling by\r\ntheir armies the forms in which they will permit them to be governed;\r\nand reserving, _in petto_, the order and extent of the usurpations\r\nfurther meditated. But I will return from a digression, anticipated,\r\ntoo, in time, into which I have been led by reflection on the criminal\r\npassions which refused to the world a favorable occasion of saving it\r\nfrom the afflictions it has since suffered.\r\n\r\nM. Necker had reached Basle before he was overtaken by the letter of\r\nthe King, inviting him back to resume the office he had recently left.\r\nHe returned immediately, and all the other Ministers having resigned,\r\na new administration was named, to wit: St. Priest and Montmorin were\r\nrestored; the Archbishop of Bordeaux was appointed Garde des sceaux, La\r\nTour du Pin, Minister of War; La Luzerne, Minister of Marine. This last\r\nwas believed to have been effected by the friendship of Montmorin; for\r\nalthough differing in politics, they continued firm in friendship, and\r\nLuzerne, although not an able man, was thought an honest one. And the\r\nPrince of Bauvau was taken into the Council.\r\n\r\nSeven Princes of the blood Royal, six ex-Ministers, and many of the\r\nhigh Noblesse, having fled, and the present Ministers, except Luzerne,\r\nbeing all of the popular party, all the functionaries of government\r\nmoved, for the present, in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of August the 4th, and on the motion of the Viscount\r\nde Noailles, brother in law of La Fayette, the Assembly abolished all\r\ntitles of rank, all the abusive privileges of feudalism, the tithes\r\nand casuals of the Clergy, all Provincial privileges, and, in fine,\r\nthe Feudal regimen generally. To the suppression of tithes, the Abbe\r\nSieyes was vehemently opposed; but his learned and logical arguments\r\nwere unheeded, and his estimation lessened by a contrast of his\r\negoism (for he was beneficed on them), with the generous abandonment\r\nof rights by the other members of the Assembly. Many days were\r\nemployed in putting into the form of laws, the numerous demolitions\r\nof ancient abuses; which done, they proceeded to the preliminary work\r\nof a Declaration of rights. There being much concord of sentiment on\r\nthe elements of this instrument, it was liberally framed, and passed\r\nwith a very general approbation. They then appointed a Committee for\r\nthe \"reduction of a projet\" of a constitution, at the head of which\r\nwas the Archbishop of Bordeaux. I received from him, as chairman of\r\nthe Committee, a letter of July 20th, requesting me to attend and\r\nassist at their deliberations; but I excused myself, on the obvious\r\nconsiderations, that my mission was to the King as Chief Magistrate\r\nof the nation, that my duties were limited to the concerns of my own\r\ncountry, and forbade me to intermeddle with the internal transactions\r\nof that, in which I had been received under a specific character only.\r\nTheir plan of a constitution was discussed in sections, and so reported\r\nfrom time to time, as agreed to by the Committee. The first respected\r\nthe general frame of the government; and that this should be formed\r\ninto three departments, Executive, Legislative and Judiciary, was\r\ngenerally agreed. But when they proceeded to subordinate developments,\r\nmany and various shades of opinion came into conflict, and schism,\r\nstrongly marked, broke the Patriots into fragments of very discordant\r\nprinciples. The first question, Whether there should be a King? met\r\nwith no open opposition; and it was readily agreed, that the government\r\nof France should be monarchical and hereditary. Shall the King have a\r\nnegative on the laws? shall that negative be absolute, or suspensive\r\nonly? Shall there be two Chambers of Legislation? or one only? If two,\r\nshall one of them be hereditary? or for life? or for a fixed term? and\r\nnamed by the King? or elected by the people? These questions found\r\nstrong differences of opinion, and produced repulsive combinations\r\namong the Patriots. The Aristocracy was cemented by a common principle,\r\nof preserving the ancient regime, or whatever should be nearest\r\nto it. Making this their polar star, they moved in phalanx, gave\r\npreponderance on every question to the minorities of the Patriots, and\r\nalways to those who advocated the least change. The features of the new\r\nconstitution were thus assuming a fearful aspect, and great alarm was\r\nproduced among the honest Patriots by these dissensions in their ranks.\r\nIn this uneasy state of things, I received one day a note from the\r\nMarquis de La Fayette, informing me that he should bring a party of six\r\nor eight friends to ask a dinner of me the next day. I assured him of\r\ntheir welcome. When they arrived, they were La Fayette himself, Duport,\r\nBarnave, Alexander la Meth, Blacon, Mounier, Maubourg, and Dagout.\r\nThese were leading Patriots, of honest but differing opinions, sensible\r\nof the necessity of effecting a coalition by mutual sacrifices,\r\nknowing each other, and not afraid, therefore, to unbosom themselves\r\nmutually. This last was a material principle in the selection. With\r\nthis view, the Marquis had invited the conference, and had fixed the\r\ntime and place inadvertently, as to the embarrassment under which it\r\nmight place me. The cloth being removed, and wine set on the table,\r\nafter the American manner, the Marquis introduced the objects of the\r\nconference, by summarily reminding them of the state of things in the\r\nAssembly, the course which the principles of the Constitution were\r\ntaking, and the inevitable result, unless checked by more concord\r\namong the Patriots themselves. He observed, that although he also had\r\nhis opinion, he was ready to sacrifice it to that of his brethren of\r\nthe same cause; but that a common opinion must now be formed, or the\r\nAristocracy would carry everything, and that, whatever they should\r\nnow agree on, he, at the head of the National force, would maintain.\r\nThe discussions began at the hour of four, and were continued till ten\r\no'clock in the evening; during which time, I was a silent witness to a\r\ncoolness and candor of argument, unusual in the conflicts of political\r\nopinion; to a logical reasoning, and chaste eloquence, disfigured by\r\nno gaudy tinsel of rhetoric or declamation, and truly worthy of being\r\nplaced in parallel with the finest dialogues of antiquity, as handed\r\nto us by Xenophon, by Plato and Cicero. The result was, that the King\r\nshould have a suspensive veto on the laws, that the legislature should\r\nbe composed of a single body only, and that to be chosen by the people.\r\nThis Concordate decided the fate of the constitution. The Patriots\r\nall rallied to the principles thus settled, carried every question\r\nagreeably to them, and reduced the Aristocracy to insignificance\r\nand impotence. But duties of exculpation were now incumbent on me.\r\nI waited on Count Montmorin the next morning, and explained to him,\r\nwith truth and candor, how it had happened that my house had been made\r\nthe scene of conferences of such a character. He told me, he already\r\nknew everything which had passed, that so far from taking umbrage\r\nat the use made of my house on that occasion, he earnestly wished I\r\nwould habitually assist at such conferences, being sure I should be\r\nuseful in moderating the warmer spirits, and promoting a wholesome\r\nand practicable reformation only. I told him, I knew too well the\r\nduties I owed to the King, to the nation, and to my own country, to\r\ntake any part in councils concerning their internal government, and\r\nthat I should persevere, with care, in the character of a neutral and\r\npassive spectator, with wishes only, and very sincere ones, that those\r\nmeasures might prevail which would be for the greatest good of the\r\nnation. I have no doubts, indeed, that this conference was previously\r\nknown and approved by this honest Minister, who was in confidence and\r\ncommunication with the Patriots, and wished for a reasonable reform of\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nHere I discontinue my relation of the French Revolution. The minuteness\r\nwith which I have so far given its details, is disproportioned to the\r\ngeneral scale of my narrative. But I have thought it justified by the\r\ninterest which the whole world must take in this Revolution. As yet,\r\nwe are but in the first chapter of its history. The appeal to the\r\nrights of man, which had been made in the United States, was taken\r\nup by France, first of the European nations. From her, the spirit has\r\nspread over those of the South. The tyrants of the North have allied\r\nindeed against it; but it is irresistible. Their opposition will only\r\nmultiply its millions of human victims; their own satellites will\r\ncatch it, and the condition of man through the civilized world, will be\r\nfinally and greatly ameliorated. This is a wonderful instance of great\r\nevents from small causes. So inscrutable is the arrangement of causes\r\nand consequences in this world, that a two-penny duty on tea, unjustly\r\nimposed in a sequestered part of it, changes the condition of all its\r\ninhabitants. I have been more minute in relating the early transactions\r\nof this regeneration, because I was in circumstances peculiarly\r\nfavorable for a knowledge of the truth. Possessing the confidence and\r\nintimacy of the leading Patriots, and more than all, of the Marquis\r\nFayette, their head and Atlas, who had no secrets from me, I learned\r\nwith correctness the views and proceedings of that party; while my\r\nintercourse with the diplomatic missionaries of Europe at Paris, all\r\nof them with the court, and eager in prying into its councils and\r\nproceedings, gave me a knowledge of these also. My information was\r\nalways, and immediately committed to writing, in letters to Mr. Jay,\r\nand often to my friends, and a recurrence to these letters now insures\r\nme against errors of memory.\r\n\r\nThese opportunities of information ceased at this period, with my\r\nretirement from this interesting scene of action. I had been more than\r\na year soliciting leave to go home, with a view to place my daughters\r\nin the society and care of their friends, and to return for a short\r\ntime to my station at Paris. But the metamorphosis through which\r\nour government was then passing from its Chrysalid to its Organic\r\nform suspended its action in a great degree; and it was not till\r\nthe last of August, that I received the permission I had asked. And\r\nhere, I cannot leave this great and good country, without expressing\r\nmy sense of its pre-eminence of character among the nations of the\r\nearth. A more benevolent people I have never known, nor greater\r\nwarmth and devotedness in their select friendships. Their kindness\r\nand accommodation to strangers is unparalleled, and the hospitality\r\nof Paris is beyond anything I had conceived to be practicable in\r\na large city. Their eminence, too, in science, the communicative\r\ndispositions of their scientific men, the politeness of the general\r\nmanners, the ease and vivacity of their conversation, give a charm\r\nto their society, to be found nowhere else. In a comparison of this,\r\nwith other countries, we have the proof of primacy, which was given\r\nto Themistocles, after the battle of Salamis. Every general voted to\r\nhimself the first reward of valor, and the second to Themistocles.\r\nSo, ask the travelled inhabitant of any nation, in what country on\r\nearth would you rather live?--Certainly, in my own, where are all my\r\nfriends, my relations, and the earliest and sweetest affections and\r\nrecollections of my life. Which would be your second choice? France.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of September I left Paris for Havre, where I was detained\r\nby contrary winds until the 8th of October. On that day, and the\r\n9th, I crossed over to Cowes, where I had engaged the Clermont, Capt.\r\nColley, to touch for me. She did so; but here again we were detained\r\nby contrary winds, until the 22d, when we embarked, and landed at\r\nNorfolk on the 23d of November. On my way home, I passed some days at\r\nEppington, in Chesterfield, the residence of my friend and connection,\r\nMr. Eppes; and, while there, I received a letter from the President,\r\nGeneral Washington, by express, covering an appointment to be Secretary\r\nof State.[23] I received it with real regret. My wish had been to\r\nreturn to Paris, where I had left my household establishment, as\r\nif there myself, and to see the end of the Revolution, which I then\r\nthought would be certainly and happily closed in less than a year. I\r\nthen meant to return home, to withdraw from political life, into which\r\nI had been impressed by the circumstances of the times, to sink into\r\nthe bosom of my family and friends, and devote myself to studies more\r\ncongenial to my mind. In my answer of December 15th, I expressed these\r\ndispositions candidly to the President, and my preference of a return\r\nto Paris; but assured him, that if it was believed I could be more\r\nuseful in the administration of the government, I would sacrifice my\r\nown inclinations without hesitation, and repair to that destination;\r\nthis I left to his decision. I arrived at Monticello on the 23d\r\nof December, where I received a second letter from the President,\r\nexpressing his continued wish that I should take my station there, but\r\nleaving me still at liberty to continue in my former office, if I could\r\nnot reconcile myself to that now proposed. This silenced my reluctance,\r\nand I accepted the new appointment.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of my stay at home, my eldest daughter had been happily\r\nmarried to the eldest son of the Tuckahoe branch of Randolphs, a young\r\ngentleman of genius, science, and honorable mind, who afterwards filled\r\na dignified station in the General Government, and the most dignified\r\nin his own State. I left Monticello on the first of March, 1790,\r\nfor New York. At Philadelphia I called on the venerable and beloved\r\nFranklin. He was then on the bed of sickness from which he never rose.\r\nMy recent return from a country in which he had left so many friends,\r\nand the perilous convulsions to which they had been exposed, revived\r\nall his anxieties to know what part they had taken, what had been\r\ntheir course, and what their fate. He went over all in succession,\r\nwith a rapidity and animation almost too much for his strength. When\r\nall his inquiries were satisfied, and a pause took place, I told him\r\nI had learned with much pleasure that, since his return to America,\r\nhe had been occupied in preparing for the world the history of his own\r\nlife. I cannot say much of that, said he; but I will give you a sample\r\nof what I shall leave; and he directed his little grandson (William\r\nBache) who was standing by the bedside, to hand him a paper from the\r\ntable, to which he pointed. He did so; and the Doctor putting it into\r\nmy hands, desired me to take it and read it at my leisure. It was about\r\na quire of folio paper, written in a large and running hand, very like\r\nhis own. I looked into it slightly, then shut it, and said I would\r\naccept his permission to read it, and would carefully return it. He\r\nsaid, \"no, keep it.\" Not certain of his meaning, I again looked into\r\nit, folded it for my pocket, and said again, I would certainly return\r\nit. \"No,\" said he, \"keep it.\" I put it into my pocket, and shortly\r\nafter took leave of him. He died on the 17th of the ensuing month of\r\nApril; and as I understood that he had bequeathed all his papers to his\r\ngrandson, William Temple Franklin, I immediately wrote to Mr. Franklin,\r\nto inform him I possessed this paper, which I should consider as his\r\nproperty, and would deliver to his order. He came on immediately to\r\nNew York, called on me for it, and I delivered it to him. As he put\r\nit into his pocket, he said carelessly, he had either the original,\r\nor another copy of it, I do not recollect which. This last expression\r\nstruck my attention forcibly, and for the first time suggested to me\r\nthe thought that Dr. Franklin had meant it as a confidential deposit\r\nin my hands, and that I had done wrong in parting from it. I have\r\nnot yet seen the collection he published of Dr. Franklin's works,\r\nand, therefore, know not if this is among them. I have been told\r\nit is not. It contained a narrative of the negotiations between Dr.\r\nFranklin and the British Ministry, when he was endeavoring to prevent\r\nthe contest of arms which followed. The negotiation was brought about\r\nby the intervention of Lord Howe and his sister, who, I believe, was\r\ncalled Lady Howe, but I may misremember her title. Lord Howe seems\r\nto have been friendly to America, and exceedingly anxious to prevent\r\na rupture. His intimacy with Dr. Franklin, and his position with the\r\nMinistry, induced him to undertake a mediation between them; in which\r\nhis sister seemed to have been associated. They carried from one\r\nto the other, backwards and forwards, the several propositions and\r\nanswers which passed, and seconded with their own intercessions, the\r\nimportance of mutual sacrifices, to preserve the peace and connection\r\nof the two countries. I remember that Lord North's answers were dry,\r\nunyielding, in the spirit of unconditional submission, and betrayed\r\nan absolute indifference to the occurrence of a rupture; and he said\r\nto the mediators distinctly, at last, that \"a rebellion was not to\r\nbe deprecated on the part of Great Britain; that the confiscations it\r\nwould produce would provide for many of their friends.\" This expression\r\nwas reported by the mediators to Dr. Franklin, and indicated so cool\r\nand calculated a purpose in the Ministry, as to render compromise\r\nhopeless, and the negotiation was discontinued. If this is not among\r\nthe papers published, we ask, what has become of it? I delivered\r\nit with my own hands, into those of Temple Franklin. It certainly\r\nestablished views so atrocious in the British government, that its\r\nsuppression would, to them, be worth a great price. But could the\r\ngrandson of Dr. Franklin be, in such degree, an accomplice in the\r\nparricide of the memory of his immortal grandfather? The suspension\r\nfor more than twenty years of the general publication, bequeathed and\r\nconfided to him, produced, for awhile, hard suspicions against him;\r\nand if, at last, all are not published, a part of these suspicions may\r\nremain with some.\r\n\r\nI arrived at New York on the 21st of March, where Congress was in\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [1] [See Appendix, note A.]\r\n\r\n     [2] [The name of a public room in the Raleigh.]\r\n\r\n     [3] Life of Washington, vol. ii, p. 151.\r\n\r\n     [4] [See Appendix, note B.]\r\n\r\n     [5] [See Appendix, note C.]\r\n\r\n     [6] See Girardin's History of Virginia, Appendix No. 12.\r\n     note.\r\n\r\n     [7] [See Appendix, note D.]\r\n\r\n     [8] [Here, in the original manuscript, commence the \"two\r\n     preceding sheets\" referred to by Mr. Jefferson, page 26, as\r\n     containing \"notes\" taken by him \"whilst these things were\r\n     going on.\" They are easily distinguished from the body of the\r\n     MS. in which they were inserted by him, being of a paper very\r\n     different in size, quality and color, from that in which the\r\n     latter is written.]\r\n\r\n     [9] July 9.\r\n\r\n     [10] [In this publication, the parts struck out are printed\r\n     in _Italics_ and inclosed in brackets.]\r\n\r\n     [11] [See Appendix, note B.]\r\n\r\n     [12] [The above note of the author is on a slip of paper,\r\n     pasted in at the end of the Declaration.

You may assure them that the\r\n     King takes a real interest in themselves as well as their\r\n     cause, and that they may rely upon his protection. On this\r\n     they may place the greater dependence, as we do not conceal,\r\n     that if the Stadtholder resumes his former influence, the\r\n     English System will soon prevail, and our alliance become a\r\n     mere affair of the imagination. The Patriots will readily\r\n     feel, that this position would be incompatible both with\r\n     the dignity and consideration of his Majesty. But in case\r\n     the Chief of the Patriots should have to fear a division,\r\n     they would have time sufficient to reclaim those whom the\r\n     Anglomaniacs had misled, and to prepare matters in such\r\n     a manner, that the question when again agitated, might be\r\n     decided according to their wishes. In such a hypothetical\r\n     case, the King authorizes you to act in concert with them,\r\n     to pursue the direction which they may think proper to give\r\n     you, and to employ every means to augment the number of the\r\n     partisans of the good cause. It remains for me to speak of\r\n     the personal security of the Patriots. You may assure them,\r\n     that under every circumstance, the King will take them under\r\n     his immediate protection, and you will make known wherever\r\n     you may judge necessary, that his Majesty will regard as a\r\n     personal offence every undertaking against their liberty.\r\n     It is to be presumed that this language, energetically\r\n     maintained, may have some effect on the audacity of the\r\n     Anglomaniacs, and that the Prince de Nassau will feel that he\r\n     runs some risk in provoking the resentment of his Majesty.\"]\r\n\r\n     [22] In the impeachment of Judge Pickering, of New Hampshire,\r\n     a habitual and maniac drunkard, no defence was made.

I became\r\nacquainted with Mr. Wythe when he was about thirty-five years of age.\r\nHe directed my studies in the law, led me into business, and continued,\r\nuntil death, my most affectionate friend. A close intimacy with him,\r\nduring that period of forty odd years, the most important of his\r\nlife, enables me to state its leading facts, which, being of my own\r\nknowledge, I vouch their truth. Of what precedes that period, I speak\r\nfrom hearsay only, in which there may be error, but of little account,\r\nas the character of the facts will themselves manifest. In the epoch\r\nof his birth, I may err a little, stating that from the recollection\r\nof a particular incident, the date of which, within a year or two, I\r\ndo not distinctly remember. These scanty outlines you will be able,\r\nI hope, to fill up from other information, and they may serve you,\r\nsometimes, as landmarks to distinguish truth from error, in what you\r\nhear from others. The exalted virtue of the man will also be a polar\r\nstar to guide you in all matters which may touch that element of his\r\ncharacter. But on that you will receive imputation from no man; for, as\r\nfar as I know, he never had an enemy. Little as I am able to contribute\r\nto the just reputation of this excellent man, it is the act of my life\r\nmost gratifying to my heart; and leaves me only to regret that a waning\r\nmemory can do no more.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Hancock I can say nothing, having known him only in the chair of\r\nCongress. Having myself been the youngest man but one in that body, the\r\ndisparity of age prevented any particular intimacy. But of him there\r\ncan be no difficulty in obtaining full information in the North.\r\n\r\n          I salute you, Sir, with sentiments of great respect,\r\n\r\n                                                          TH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES FOR THE BIOGRAPHY OF GEORGE WYTHE.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wythe was born about the year 1727, or 1728, of a respectable\r\nfamily in the County of Elizabeth City, on the shores of the\r\nChesapeake. He inherited, from his father, a fortune sufficient for\r\nindependence and ease. He had not the benefit of a regular education\r\nin the schools, but acquired a good one of himself, and without\r\nassistance; insomuch, as to become the best Latin and Greek scholar\r\nin the State. It is said, that while reading the Greek Testament, his\r\nmother held an English one, to aid him in rendering the Greek text\r\nconformably with that. He also acquired, by his own reading, a good\r\nknowledge of Mathematics, and of Natural and Moral Philosophy. He\r\nengaged in the study of the law under the direction of a Mr. Lewis,\r\nof that profession, and went early to the bar of the General Court,\r\nthen occupied by men of great ability, learning, and dignity in their\r\nprofession. He soon became eminent among them, and, in process of time,\r\nthe first at the bar, taking into consideration his superior learning,\r\ncorrect elocution, and logical style of reasoning; for in pleading he\r\nnever indulged himself with an useless or declamatory thought or word;\r\nand became as distinguished by correctness and purity of conduct in\r\nhis profession, as he was by his industry and fidelity to those who\r\nemployed him. He was early elected to the House of Representatives,\r\nthen called the House of Burgesses, and continued in it until the\r\nRevolution. On the first dawn of that, instead of higgling on half-way\r\nprinciples, as others did who feared to follow their reason, he took\r\nhis stand on the solid ground that the only link of political union\r\nbetween us and Great Britain, was the identity of our Executive; that\r\nthat nation and its Parliament had no more authority over us, than we\r\nhad over them, and that we were co-ordinate nations with Great Britain\r\nand Hanover.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, he was a member of a Committee of the House of Burgesses,\r\nappointed to prepare a Petition to the King, a Memorial to the House\r\nof Lords, and a Remonstrance to the House of Commons, on the subject\r\nof the proposed Stamp Act. He was made draughtsman of the last, and,\r\nfollowing his own principles, he so far overwent the timid hesitations\r\nof his colleagues, that his draught was subjected by them to material\r\nmodifications; and, when the famous Resolutions of Mr. Henry, in 1775,\r\nwere proposed, it was not on any difference of principle that they\r\nwere opposed by Wythe, Randolph, Pendleton, Nicholas, Bland, and other\r\nworthies, who had long been the habitual leaders of the House; but\r\nbecause those papers of the preceding session had already expressed the\r\nsame sentiments and assertions of right, and that an answer to them was\r\nyet to be expected.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1775, he was appointed a member of Congress, and in 1776,\r\nsigned the Declaration of Independence, of which he had, in debate,\r\nbeen an eminent supporter. And subsequently, in the same year, he\r\nwas appointed, by the Legislature of Virginia, one of a Committee\r\nto revise the laws of the State, as well of British as of Colonial\r\nenactment, and to prepare bills for re-enacting them, with such\r\nalterations as the change in the form and principles of the government,\r\nand other circumstances, required, and of this work, he executed the\r\nperiod commencing with the revolution in England, and ending with\r\nthe establishment of the new government here; excepting the Acts for\r\nregulating descents, for religious freedom, and for proportioning\r\ncrimes and punishments. In 1777, he was chosen Speaker of the House of\r\nDelegates, being of distinguished learning in Parliamentary law and\r\nproceedings; and towards the end of the same year, he was appointed\r\none of the three Chancellors, to whom that department of the Judiciary\r\nwas confided, on the first organization of the new government. On a\r\nsubsequent change of the form of that court, he was appointed sole\r\nChancellor, in which office he continued to act until his death, which\r\nhappened in June, 1806, about the seventy-eighth or seventy-ninth year\r\nof his age.\r\n\r\nMr. Wythe had been twice married: first, I believe, to a daughter\r\nof Mr. Lewis, with whom he had studied law, and afterwards to a Miss\r\nTaliaferro, of a wealthy and respectable family in the neighborhood of\r\nWilliamsburg; by neither of whom did he leave issue.\r\n\r\nNo man ever left behind him a character more venerated than George\r\nWythe. His virtue was of the purest tint; his integrity inflexible,\r\nand his justice exact; of warm patriotism, and, devoted as he was to\r\nliberty, and the natural and equal rights of man, he might truly be\r\ncalled the Cato of his country, without the avarice of the Roman; for\r\na more disinterested person never lived. Temperance and regularity\r\nin all his habits, gave him general good health, and his unaffected\r\nmodesty and suavity of manners endeared him to every one. He was of\r\neasy elocution, his language chaste, methodical in the arrangement of\r\nhis matter, learned and logical in the use of it, and of great urbanity\r\nin debate; not quick of apprehension, but, with a little time, profound\r\nin penetration, and sound in conclusion. In his philosophy he was firm,\r\nand neither troubling, nor perhaps trusting, any one with his religious\r\ncreed, he left the world to the conclusion, that that religion must be\r\ngood which could produce a life of such exemplary virtue.\r\n\r\nHis stature was of the middle size, well formed and proportioned, and\r\nthe features of his face were manly, comely, and engaging. Such was\r\nGeorge Wythe, the honor of his own, and the model of future times.\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE B.]\r\n\r\nLETTER TO SAMUEL A. WELLS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               Monticello, May 12, 1819.\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\nAn absence of some time at an occasional and distant residence, must\r\napologize for the delay in acknowledging the receipt of your favor\r\nof April 12; and, candor obliges me to add, that it has been somewhat\r\nextended by an aversion to writing, as well as to calls on my memory\r\nfor facts so much obliterated from it by time, as to lessen my own\r\nconfidence in the traces which seem to remain. One of the inquiries\r\nin your letter, however, may be answered without an appeal to the\r\nmemory. It is that respecting the question, whether committees of\r\ncorrespondence originated in Virginia, or Massachusetts? on which\r\nyou suppose me to have claimed it for Virginia; but certainly I\r\nhave never made such a claim. The idea, I suppose, has been taken up\r\nfrom what is said in Wirt's history of Mr. Henry, page 87, and from\r\nan inexact attention to its precise terms. It is there said, \"this\r\nHouse (of Burgesses, of Virginia) had the merit of originating that\r\npowerful engine of resistance, corresponding committees _between\r\nthe legislatures of the different colonies_.\" That the fact, as here\r\nexpressed, is true, your letter bears witness, when it says, that the\r\nresolutions of Virginia, for this purpose, were transmitted to the\r\nspeakers of the different assemblies, and by that of Massachusetts,\r\nwas laid, at the next session, before that body, who appointed a\r\ncommittee for the specified object: adding, \"thus, in Massachusetts,\r\nthere were two committees of correspondence, one chosen by the\r\npeople, the other appointed by the House of Assembly; in the former,\r\nMassachusetts preceded Virginia; in the latter, Virginia preceded\r\nMassachusetts.\" To the origination of committees for the interior\r\ncorrespondence between the counties and towns of a State, I know of\r\nno claim on the part of Virginia; and certainly none was ever made by\r\nmyself. I perceive, however, one error, into which memory had led me.\r\nOur committee for national correspondence, was appointed in March,\r\n'73, and I well remember, that going to Williamsburg, in the month of\r\nJune following, Peyton Randolph, our Chairman, told me that messengers\r\nbearing despatches between the two States, had crossed each other by\r\nthe way, that of Virginia carrying our propositions for a committee\r\nof national correspondence, and that of Massachusetts, bringing, as\r\nmy memory suggested, a similar proposition. But here I must have\r\nmisremembered; and the resolutions brought us from Massachusetts,\r\nwere probably those you mention of the town-meeting of Boston, on\r\nthe motion of Mr. Samuel Adams, appointing a committee \"to state the\r\nrights of the colonists, and of that province in particular, and the\r\ninfringements of them; to communicate them to the several towns, as\r\nthe sense of the town of Boston, and to request, of each town, a free\r\ncommunication of its sentiments on the subject.\" I suppose, therefore,\r\nthat these resolutions were not received, as you think, while the House\r\nof Burgesses was in session in March, 1773, but a few days after we\r\nrose, and were probably what was sent by the messenger, who crossed\r\nours by the way. They may, however, have been still different. I must,\r\ntherefore, have been mistaken in supposing, and stating to Mr. Wirt,\r\nthat the proposition of a committee for national correspondence, was\r\nnearly simultaneous in Virginia and Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nA similar misapprehension of another passage in Mr. Wirt's book,\r\nfor which I am also quoted, has produced a similar reclamation on\r\nthe part of Massachusetts, by some of her most distinguished and\r\nestimable citizens. I had been applied to by Mr. Wirt, for such facts\r\nrespecting Mr. Henry, as my intimacy with him, and participation in\r\nthe transactions of the day, might have placed within my knowledge. I\r\naccordingly committed them to paper; and Virginia being the theatre\r\nof his action, was the only subject within my contemplation. While\r\nspeaking of him, of the resolutions and measures here, in which he\r\nhad the acknowledged lead, I used the expression, that \"Mr. Henry\r\ncertainly gave the first impulse to the ball of revolution.\" [Wirt,\r\npage 41.] The expression is indeed general, and in all its extension,\r\nwould comprehend all the sister States; but indulgent construction\r\nwould restrain it, as was really meant, to the subject matter under\r\ncontemplation, which was Virginia alone; according to the rule of the\r\nlawyers, and a fair canon of general criticism, that every expression\r\nshould be construed secundum subjectam materiam. Where the first attack\r\nwas made, there must have been of course, the first act of resistance,\r\nand that was in Massachusetts. Our first overt act of war, was Mr.\r\nHenry's embodying a force of militia from several counties, regularly\r\narmed and organized, marching them in military array, and making\r\nreprisal on the King's treasury at the seat of government, for the\r\npublic powder taken away by his Governor. This was on the last days of\r\nApril, 1775. Your formal battle of Lexington, was ten or twelve days\r\nbefore that, and greatly overshadowed in importance, as it preceded in\r\ntime, our little affray, which merely amounted to a levying of arms\r\nagainst the King; and very possibly, you had had military affrays\r\nbefore the regular battle of Lexington.\r\n\r\nThese explanations will, I hope, assure you, Sir, that so far as either\r\nfacts or opinions have been truly quoted from me, they have never been\r\nmeant to intercept the just fame of Massachusetts, for the promptitude\r\nand perseverance of her early resistance. We willingly cede to her the\r\nlaud of having been (although not exclusively) \"the cradle of sound\r\nprinciples,\" and, if some of us believe she has deflected from them in\r\nher course, we retain full confidence in her ultimate return to them.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to your quotation from Mr. Galloway's statement\r\nof what passed in Congress, on their Declaration of Independence;\r\nin which statement there is not one word of truth, and where bearing\r\nsome resemblance to truth, it is an entire perversion of it. I do not\r\ncharge this on Mr. Galloway himself; his desertion having taken place\r\nlong before these measures, he doubtless received his information from\r\nsome of the loyal friends whom he left behind him. But as yourself,\r\nas well as others, appear embarrassed by inconsistent accounts of\r\nthe proceedings on that memorable occasion, and as those who have\r\nendeavored to restore the truth, have themselves committed some errors,\r\nI will give you some extracts from a written document on that subject;\r\nfor the truth of which I pledge myself to heaven and earth; having,\r\nwhile the question of Independence was under consideration before\r\nCongress, taken written notes, in my seat, of what was passing, and\r\nreduced them to form on the final conclusion. I have now before me that\r\npaper, from which the following are extracts. \"Friday, June 7th, 1776.\r\nThe delegates from Virginia moved, in obedience to instructions from\r\ntheir constituents, that the Congress should declare that these United\r\nColonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States;\r\nthat they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and\r\nthat all political connection between them and the State of Great\r\nBritain is, and ought to be totally dissolved; that measures should be\r\nimmediately taken for procuring the assistance of foreign powers, and a\r\nConfederation be formed to bind the colonies more closely together. The\r\nHouse, being obliged to attend at that time to some other business, the\r\nproposition was referred to the next day, when the members were ordered\r\nto attend punctually at ten o'clock. Saturday, June 8th. They proceeded\r\nto take it into consideration, and referred it to a committee of the\r\nwhole, into which they immediately resolved themselves, and passed that\r\nday in debating on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"It appearing in the course of these debates, that the colonies of New\r\nYork, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and South Carolina,\r\nwere not yet matured for falling from the parent stem, but that they\r\nwere fast advancing to that state, it was thought most prudent to wait\r\na while for them, and to postpone the final decision to July 1st. But\r\nthat this might occasion as little delay as possible, a Committee was\r\nappointed to prepare a Declaration of Independence. The Committee\r\nwere John Adams, Dr. Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert R. Livingston\r\nand myself. This was reported to the House on Friday, the 28th of\r\nJune, when it was read and ordered to lie on the table. On Monday,\r\nthe 1st of July, the House resolved itself into a Committee of the\r\nwhole, and resumed the consideration of the original motion made by the\r\ndelegates of Virginia, which, being again debated through the day, was\r\ncarried in the affirmative by the votes of New Hampshire, Connecticut,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina and Georgia. South Carolina and Pennsylvania voted against\r\nit. Delaware had but two members present, and they were divided. The\r\ndelegates from New York declared they were for it themselves, and were\r\nassured their constituents were for it; but that their instructions\r\nhaving been drawn near a twelvemonth before, when reconciliation was\r\nstill the general object, they were enjoined by them, to do nothing\r\nwhich should impede that object. They, therefore, thought themselves\r\nnot justifiable in voting on either side, and asked leave to withdraw\r\nfrom the question, which was given them. The Committee rose, and\r\nreported their resolutions to the House. Mr. Rutledge, of South\r\nCarolina, then requested the determination might be put off to the\r\nnext day, as he believed his colleagues, though they disapproved of\r\nthe resolution, would then join in it for the sake of unanimity. The\r\nultimate question, whether the House would agree to the resolution of\r\nthe Committee, was accordingly postponed to the next day, when it was\r\nagain moved, and South Carolina concurred in voting for it. In the\r\nmeantime, a third member had come post from the Delaware counties, and\r\nturned the vote of that colony in favor of the resolution. Members of\r\na different sentiment attending that morning from Pennsylvania also,\r\nher vote was changed; so that the whole twelve colonies, who were\r\nauthorized to vote at all, gave their votes for it; and within a few\r\ndays [July 9th] the convention of New York approved of it, and this\r\nsupplied the void occasioned by the withdrawing of their delegates from\r\nthe vote.\" [Be careful to observe, that this vacillation and vote were\r\non the original motion of the 7th of June, by the Virginia delegates,\r\nthat Congress should declare the colonies independent.] \"Congress\r\nproceeded, the same day, to consider the Declaration of Independence,\r\nwhich had been reported and laid on the table the Friday preceding,\r\nand on Monday, referred to a Committee of the whole. The pusillanimous\r\nidea, that we had friends in England worth keeping terms with, still\r\nhaunted the minds of many. For this reason, those passages which\r\nconveyed censures on the people of England were struck out, lest they\r\nshould give them offence. The debates having taken up the greater parts\r\nof the second, third and fourth days of July, were, in the evening\r\nof the last, closed; the Declaration was reported by the Committee,\r\nagreed to by the House, and signed by every member present except Mr.\r\nDickinson.\" So far my notes.\r\n\r\nGovernor M'Kean, in his letter to McCorkle of July 16th, 1817, has\r\nthrown some lights on the transactions of that day; but, trusting to\r\nhis memory chiefly, at an age when our memories are not to be trusted,\r\nhe has confounded two questions, and ascribed proceedings to one which\r\nbelonged to the other. These two questions were, 1st, the Virginia\r\nmotion of June the 7th, to declare Independence; and 2d, the actual\r\nDeclaration, its matter and form. Thus he states the question on the\r\nDeclaration itself, as decided on the 1st of July; but it was the\r\nVirginia motion which was voted on that day in committee of the whole;\r\nSouth Carolina, as well as Pennsylvania, then voting against it. But\r\nthe ultimate decision in _the House_, on the report of the Committee,\r\nbeing, by request, postponed to the next morning, all the States voted\r\nfor it, except New York, whose vote was delayed for the reason before\r\nstated. It was not till the 2d of July, that the Declaration itself was\r\ntaken up; nor till the 4th, that it was decided, and it was signed by\r\nevery member present, except Mr. Dickinson.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent signatures of members who were not then present, and\r\nsome of them not yet in office, is easily explained, if we observe\r\nwho they were; to wit, that they were of New York and Pennsylvania.\r\nNew York did not sign till the 15th, because it was not till the\r\n9th (five days after the general signature), that their Convention\r\nauthorized them to do so. The Convention of Pennsylvania, learning that\r\nit had been signed by a minority only of their delegates, named a new\r\ndelegation on the 20th, leaving out Mr. Dickinson, who had refused to\r\nsign, Willing and Humphreys who had withdrawn, re-appointing the three\r\nmembers who had signed, Morris, who had not been present, and five new\r\nones, to wit, Rush, Clymer, Smith, Taylor and Ross: and Morris, and\r\nthe five new members were permitted to sign, because it manifested\r\nthe assent of their full delegation, and the express will of their\r\nConvention, which might have been doubted on the former signature\r\nof a minority only. Why the signature of Thornton, of New Hampshire,\r\nwas permitted so late as the 4th of November, I cannot now say; but\r\nundoubtedly for some particular reason, which we should find to have\r\nbeen good, had it been expressed. These were the only post-signers, and\r\nyou see, Sir, that there were solid reasons for receiving those of New\r\nYork and Pennsylvania, and that this circumstance in no wise affects\r\nthe faith of this Declaratory Charter of our rights, and of the rights\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nWith a view to correct errors of fact before they become inveterate\r\nby repetition, I have stated what I find essentially material in my\r\npapers, but with that brevity, which the labor of writing constrains me\r\nto use.\r\n\r\nOn the four particular articles of enquiry in your letter, respecting\r\nyour grandfather, the venerable Samuel Adams, neither memory nor\r\nmemorandums enable me to give any information. I can say that he was\r\ntruly a great man, wise in council, fertile in resources, immoveable\r\nin his purposes, and had, I think, a greater share than any other\r\nmember, in advising and directing our measures, in the Northern war.\r\nAs a speaker, he could not be compared with his living colleague\r\nand namesake, whose deep conceptions, nervous style, and undaunted\r\nfirmness, made him truly our bulwark in debate. But Mr. Samuel Adams,\r\nalthough not of fluent elocution, was so rigorously logical, so clear\r\nin his views, abundant in good sense, and master always of his subject,\r\nthat he commanded the most profound attention, whenever he rose in an\r\nassembly, by which the froth of declamation was heard with the most\r\nsovereign contempt. I sincerely rejoice, that the record of his worth\r\nis to be undertaken by one so much disposed as you will be, to hand him\r\ndown fairly to that posterity for whose liberty and happiness he was so\r\nzealous a laborer.\r\n\r\nWith sentiments of sincere veneration for his memory, accept yourself\r\nthis tribute to it, with the assurance of my great respect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. August 6th, 1822. Since the date of this letter, to-wit, this\r\nday, August 6, '22, I have received the new publication of the Secret\r\nJournals of Congress, wherein is stated a resolution of July 19th,\r\n1776, that the Declaration passed on the 4th, be fairly engrossed on\r\nparchment, and when engrossed, be signed by every member; and another\r\nof August 2nd, that being engrossed and compared at the table, it was\r\nsigned by the members; that is to say, the copy engrossed on parchment\r\n(for durability) was signed by the members, after being compared at\r\nthe table, with the original one signed on paper as before stated.\r\nI add this P. S. to the copy of my letter to Mr. Wells, to prevent\r\nconfounding the signature of the original with that of the copy\r\nengrossed on parchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE C.]\r\n\r\n_On the instructions given to the first delegation of Virginia to\r\nCongress, in August, 1774._\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Virginia happened to be in session, in Williamsburg,\r\nwhen news was received of the passage, by the British Parliament, of\r\nthe Boston Port Bill, which was to take effect on the first day of June\r\nthen ensuing. The House of Burgesses, thereupon, passed a resolution,\r\nrecommending to their fellow-citizens, that that day should be set\r\napart for fasting and prayer to the Supreme Being, imploring him to\r\navert the calamities then threatening us, and to give us one heart and\r\none mind to oppose every invasion of our liberties. The next day, May\r\nthe 20th, 1774, the Governor dissolved us. We immediately repaired to\r\na room in the Raleigh tavern, about one hundred paces distant from the\r\nCapitol, formed ourselves into a meeting, Peyton Randolph in the chair,\r\nand came to resolutions, declaring, that an attack on one colony, to\r\nenforce arbitrary acts, ought to be considered as an attack on all, and\r\nto be opposed by the united wisdom of all. We, therefore, appointed\r\na Committee of correspondence, to address letters to the Speakers of\r\nthe several Houses of Representatives of the colonies, proposing the\r\nappointment of deputies from each, to meet _annually in a General\r\nCongress_, to deliberate on their common interests, and on the measures\r\nto be pursued in common. The members then separated to their several\r\nhomes, except those of the Committee, who met the next day, prepared\r\nletters according to instructions, and despatched them by messengers\r\nexpress, to their several destinations. It had been agreed, also,\r\nby the meeting, that the Burgesses, who should be elected under the\r\nwrits then issuing, should be requested to meet in Convention, on a\r\ncertain day in August, to learn the results of these letters, and to\r\nappoint delegates to a Congress, should that measure be approved by\r\nthe other colonies. At the election, the people re-elected every man\r\nof the former Assembly, as a proof of their approbation of what they\r\nhad done. Before I left home, to attend the Convention, I prepared\r\nwhat I thought might be given, in instruction, to the Delegates who\r\nshould be appointed to attend the General Congress proposed. They were\r\ndrawn in haste, with a number of blanks, with some uncertainties and\r\ninaccuracies of historical facts, which I neglected at the moment,\r\nknowing they could be readily corrected at the meeting. I set out on my\r\njourney, but was taken sick on the road, and was unable to proceed. I\r\ntherefore sent on, by express, two copies, one under cover to Patrick\r\nHenry, the other to Peyton Randolph, who I knew would be in the chair\r\nof the Convention. Of the former, no more was ever heard or known.\r\nMr. Henry probably thought it too bold, as a first measure, as the\r\nmajority of the members did. On the other copy being laid on the table\r\nof the Convention, by Peyton Randolph, as the proposition of a member,\r\nwho was prevented from attendance by sickness on the road, tamer\r\nsentiments were preferred, and, I believe, wisely preferred; the leap\r\nI proposed being too long, as yet, for the mass of our citizens. The\r\ndistance between these, and the instructions actually adopted, is of\r\nsome curiosity, however, as it shews the inequality of pace with which\r\nwe moved, and the prudence required to keep front and rear together.\r\nMy creed had been formed on unsheathing the sword at Lexington. They\r\nprinted the paper, however, and gave it the title of 'A summary view\r\nof the rights of British America.' In this form it got to London, where\r\nthe opposition took it up, shaped it to opposition views, and, in that\r\nform, it ran rapidly through several editions.\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall, in his history of General Washington, chapter 3,\r\nspeaking of this proposition for Committees of correspondence and for\r\na General Congress, says, 'this measure had already been proposed in\r\ntown meeting, in Boston,' and some pages before, he had said, that 'at\r\na session of the General Court of Massachusetts, in September, 1770,\r\nthat Court, in pursuance of a favorite idea of uniting all the colonies\r\nin one system of measures, elected a Committee of correspondence, to\r\ncommunicate with such Committees as might be appointed by the other\r\ncolonies.' This is an error. The Committees of correspondence, elected\r\nby Massachusetts, were expressly for a correspondence among the several\r\n_towns_ of that province only. Besides the text of their proceedings,\r\nhis own note X, proves this. The first proposition for a general\r\ncorrespondence between the several states, and for a General Congress,\r\nwas made by our meeting of May, 1774. Botta, copying Marshall, has\r\nrepeated his error, and so it will be handed on from copyist to\r\ncopyist, _ad infinitum_. Here follows my proposition, and the more\r\nprudent one which was adopted.\r\n\r\nResolved, That it be an instruction to the said deputies, when\r\nassembled in General Congress, with the deputies from the other states\r\nof British America, to propose to the said Congress, that an humble\r\nand dutiful address be presented to his Majesty, begging leave to\r\nlay before him, as Chief Magistrate of the British empire, the united\r\ncomplaints of his Majesty's subjects in America; complaints which are\r\nexcited by many unwarrantable encroachments and usurpations, attempted\r\nto be made by the legislature of one part of the empire, upon the\r\nrights which God, and the laws, have given equally and independently\r\nto all. To represent to his Majesty that these, his States, have often\r\nindividually made humble application to his imperial Throne, to obtain,\r\nthrough its intervention, some redress of their injured rights; to\r\nnone of which, was ever even an answer condescended. Humbly to hope\r\nthat this, their joint address, penned in the language of truth, and\r\ndivested of those expressions of servility, which would persuade his\r\nMajesty that we are asking favors, and not rights, shall obtain from\r\nhis Majesty a more respectful acceptance; and this his Majesty will\r\nthink we have reason to expect, when he reflects that he is no more\r\nthan the chief officer of the people, appointed by the laws, and\r\ncircumscribed with definite powers, to assist in working the great\r\nmachine of government, erected for their use, and, consequently,\r\nsubject to their superintendence; and, in order that these, our rights,\r\nas well as the invasions of them, may be laid more fully before his\r\nMajesty, to take a view of them, from the origin and first settlement\r\nof these countries.\r\n\r\nTo remind him that our ancestors, before their emigration to America,\r\nwere the free inhabitants of the British dominions in Europe, and\r\npossessed a right, which nature has given to all men, of departing\r\nfrom the country in which chance, not choice, has placed them, of going\r\nin quest of new habitations, and of there establishing new societies,\r\nunder such laws and regulations as, to them, shall seem most likely to\r\npromote public happiness. That their Saxon ancestors had, under this\r\nuniversal law, in like manner, left their native wilds and woods in the\r\nNorth of Europe, had possessed themselves of the Island of Britain,\r\nthen less charged with inhabitants, and had established there that\r\nsystem of laws which has so long been the glory and protection of that\r\ncountry. Nor was ever any claim of superiority or dependence asserted\r\nover them, by that mother country from which they had migrated: and\r\nwere such a claim made, it is believed his Majesty's subjects in Great\r\nBritain have too firm a feeling of the rights derived to them from\r\ntheir ancestors, to bow down the sovereignty of their state before\r\nsuch visionary pretensions. And it is thought that no circumstance\r\nhas occurred to distinguish, materially, the British from the Saxon\r\nemigration. America was conquered, and her settlements made and\r\nfirmly established, at the expense of individuals, and not of the\r\nBritish public. Their own blood was spilt in acquiring lands for their\r\nsettlement, their own fortunes expended in making that settlement\r\neffectual. For themselves they fought, for themselves they conquered,\r\nand for themselves alone they have right to hold. No shilling was ever\r\nissued from the public treasures of his Majesty, or his ancestors,\r\nfor their assistance, till of very late times, after the colonies\r\nhad become established on a firm and permanent footing. That then,\r\nindeed, having become valuable to Great Britain for her commercial\r\npurposes, his Parliament was pleased to lend them assistance against\r\nan enemy who would fain have drawn to herself the benefits of their\r\ncommerce, to the great aggrandisement of herself, and danger of Great\r\nBritain. Such assistance, and in such circumstances, they had often\r\nbefore given to Portugal and other allied states, with whom they\r\ncarry on a commercial intercourse. Yet these states never supposed,\r\nthat by calling in her aid, they thereby submitted themselves to her\r\nsovereignty. Had such terms been proposed, they would have rejected\r\nthem with disdain, and trusted for better, to the moderation of their\r\nenemies, or to a vigorous exertion of their own force. We do not,\r\nhowever, mean to underrate those aids, which, to us, were doubtless\r\nvaluable, on whatever principles granted: but we would shew that they\r\ncannot give a title to that authority which the British Parliament\r\nwould arrogate over us; and that may amply be repaid by our giving to\r\nthe inhabitants of Great Britain such exclusive privileges in trade as\r\nmay be advantageous to them, and, at the same time, not too restrictive\r\nto ourselves. That settlement having been thus effected in the wilds\r\nof America, the emigrants thought proper to adopt that system of laws,\r\nunder which they had hitherto lived in the mother country, and to\r\ncontinue their union with her, by submitting themselves to the same\r\ncommon sovereign, who was thereby made the central link, connecting the\r\nseveral parts of the empire thus newly multiplied.\r\n\r\nBut that not long were they permitted, however far they thought\r\nthemselves removed from the hand of oppression, to hold undisturbed the\r\nrights thus acquired at the hazard of their lives and loss of their\r\nfortunes. A family of Princes was then on the British throne, whose\r\ntreasonable crimes against their people, brought on them, afterwards,\r\nthe exertion of those sacred and sovereign rights of punishment,\r\nreserved in the hands of the people for cases of extreme necessity,\r\nand judged by the constitution unsafe to be delegated to any other\r\njudicature. While every day brought forth some new and unjustifiable\r\nexertion of power over their subjects on that side of the water, it\r\nwas not to be expected that those here, much less able at that time\r\nto oppose the designs of despotism, should be exempted from injury.\r\nAccordingly, this country which had been acquired by the lives, the\r\nlabors, and fortunes of individual adventurers, was by these Princes,\r\nseveral times, parted out and distributed among the favorites and\r\nfollowers of their fortunes; and, by an assumed right of the Crown\r\nalone, were erected into distinct and independent governments; a\r\nmeasure, which it is believed, his Majesty's prudence and understanding\r\nwould prevent him from imitating at this day; as no exercise of such\r\npower, of dividing and dismembering a country, has ever occurred in his\r\nMajesty's realm of England, though now of very ancient standing; nor\r\ncould it be justified or acquiesced under there, or in any part of his\r\nMajesty's empire.\r\n\r\nThat the exercise of a free trade with all parts of the world,\r\npossessed by the American colonists, as of natural right, and which\r\nno law of their own had taken away or abridged, was next the object\r\nof unjust encroachment. Some of the colonies having thought proper\r\nto continue the administration of their government in the name and\r\nunder the authority of his Majesty, King Charles the first, whom,\r\nnotwithstanding his late deposition by the Commonwealth of England,\r\nthey continued in the sovereignty of their State, the Parliament,\r\nfor the Commonwealth, took the same in high offence, and assumed upon\r\nthemselves the power of prohibiting their trade with all other parts\r\nof the world, except the Island of Great Britain. This arbitrary act,\r\nhowever, they soon recalled, and by solemn treaty entered into on\r\nthe 12th day of March, 1651, between the said Commonwealth, by their\r\nCommissioners, and the colony of Virginia by their House of Burgesses,\r\nit was expressly stipulated by the eighth article of the said treaty,\r\nthat they should have 'free trade as the people of England do enjoy\r\nto all places and with all nations, according to the laws of that\r\nCommonwealth.' But that, upon the restoration of his Majesty, King\r\nCharles the second, their rights of free commerce fell once more a\r\nvictim to arbitrary power; and by several acts of his reign, as well\r\nas of some of his successors, the trade of the colonies was laid under\r\nsuch restrictions, as show what hopes they might form from the justice\r\nof a British Parliament, were its uncontrolled power admitted over\r\nthese States.[24] History has informed us, that bodies of men as well\r\nas of individuals, are susceptible of the spirit of tyranny. A view\r\nof these acts of Parliament for regulation, as it has been affectedly\r\ncalled, of the American trade, if all other evidences were removed out\r\nof the case, would undeniably evince the truth of this observation.\r\nBesides the duties they impose on our articles of export and import,\r\nthey prohibit our going to any markets Northward of Cape Finisterra, in\r\nthe kingdom of Spain, for the sale of commodities which Great Britain\r\nwill not take from us, and for the purchase of others, with which she\r\ncannot supply us; and that, for no other than the arbitrary purpose of\r\npurchasing for themselves, by a sacrifice of our rights and interests,\r\ncertain privileges in their commerce with an allied state, who, in\r\nconfidence, that their exclusive trade with America will be continued,\r\nwhile the principles and power of the British Parliament be the same,\r\nhave indulged themselves in every exorbitance which their avarice\r\ncould dictate or our necessity extort: have raised their commodities\r\ncalled for in America, to the double and treble of what they sold for,\r\nbefore such exclusive privileges were given them, and of what better\r\ncommodities of the same kind would cost us elsewhere; and, at the same\r\ntime, give us much less for what we carry thither, than might be had\r\nat more convenient ports. That these acts prohibit us from carrying, in\r\nquest of other purchasers, the surplus of our tobaccos, remaining after\r\nthe consumption of Great Britain is supplied: so that we must leave\r\nthem with the British merchant, for whatever he will please to allow\r\nus, to be by him re-shipped to foreign markets, where he will reap the\r\nbenefits of making sale of them for full value. That, to heighten still\r\nthe idea of Parliamentary justice, and to show with what moderation\r\nthey are like to exercise power, where themselves are to feel no\r\npart of its weight, we take leave to mention to his Majesty, certain\r\nother acts of the British Parliament, by which they would prohibit\r\nus from manufacturing, for our own use, the articles we raise on our\r\nown lands, with our own labor. By an act passed in the fifth year of\r\nthe reign of his late Majesty, King George the second, an American\r\nsubject is forbidden to make a hat for himself, of the fur which he\r\nhas taken, perhaps, on his own soil; an instance of despotism, to\r\nwhich no parallel can be produced in the most arbitrary ages of British\r\nhistory. By one other act, passed in the twenty-third year of the same\r\nreign, the iron which we make, we are forbidden to manufacture; and,\r\nheavy as that article is, and necessary in every branch of husbandry,\r\nbesides commission and insurance, we are to pay freight for it to Great\r\nBritain, and freight for it back again, for the purpose of supporting,\r\nnot men, but machines, in the island of Great Britain. In the same\r\nspirit of equal and impartial legislation, is to be viewed the act\r\nof Parliament, passed in the fifth year of the same reign, by which\r\nAmerican lands are made subject to the demands of British creditors,\r\nwhile their own lands were still continued unanswerable for their\r\ndebts; from which, one of these conclusions must necessarily follow,\r\neither that justice is not the same thing in America as in Britain,\r\nor else, that the British Parliament pay less regard to it here than\r\nthere. But, that we do not point out to his Majesty the injustice\r\nof these acts, with intent to rest on that principle the cause of\r\ntheir nullity; but to show that experience confirms the propriety\r\nof those political principles, which exempt us from the jurisdiction\r\nof the British Parliament. The true ground on which we declare these\r\nacts void, is, that the British Parliament has no right to exercise\r\nauthority over us.\r\n\r\nThat these exercises of usurped power have not been confined to\r\ninstances alone, in which themselves were interested; but they have\r\nalso intermeddled with the regulation of the internal affairs of the\r\ncolonies. The act of the 9th of Anne for establishing a post office in\r\nAmerica, seems to have had little connection with British convenience,\r\nexcept that of accommodating his Majesty's ministers and favorites with\r\nthe sale of a lucrative and easy office.\r\n\r\nThat thus have we hastened through the reigns which preceded his\r\nMajesty's, during which the violation of our rights were less alarming,\r\nbecause repeated at more distant intervals, than that rapid and bold\r\nsuccession of injuries, which is likely to distinguish the present from\r\nall other periods of American story. Scarcely have our minds been able\r\nto emerge from the astonishment into which one stroke of Parliamentary\r\nthunder has involved us, before another more heavy and more alarming is\r\nfallen on us. Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental\r\nopinion of a day; but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished\r\nperiod, and pursued unalterably through every change of ministers,\r\ntoo plainly prove a deliberate, systematical plan of reducing us to\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Act for granting certain duties.]\r\n\r\nThat the act passed in the fourth year of his Majesty's reign, entitled\r\n'an act\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stamp act.]\r\n\r\nOne other act passed in the fifth year of his reign, entitled 'an act\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Act declaring the right of Parliament over the colonies.]\r\n\r\nOne other act passed in the sixth year of his reign, entitled 'an act\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Act for granting duties on paper, tea, &c.]\r\n\r\nAnd one other act passed in the seventh year of his reign, entitled 'an\r\nact\r\n\r\nForm that connected chain of Parliamentary usurpation, which has\r\nalready been the subject of frequent applications to his Majesty,\r\nand the Houses of Lords and Commons of Great Britain; and, no answers\r\nhaving yet been condescended to any of these, we shall not trouble his\r\nMajesty with a repetition of the matters they contained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Act suspending legislature of New-York.]\r\n\r\nBut that one other act passed in the same seventh year of his reign,\r\nhaving been a peculiar attempt, must ever require peculiar mention. It\r\nis entitled 'an act\r\n\r\nOne free and independent legislature, hereby takes upon itself to\r\nsuspend the powers of another, free and independent as itself. Thus\r\nexhibiting a phenomenon unknown in nature, the creator, and creature of\r\nits own power. Not only the principles of common sense, but the common\r\nfeelings of human nature must be surrendered up, before his Majesty's\r\nsubjects here, can be persuaded to believe, that they hold their\r\npolitical existence at the will of a British Parliament. Shall these\r\ngovernments be dissolved, their property annihilated, and their people\r\nreduced to a state of nature, at the imperious breath of a body of men\r\nwhom they never saw, in whom they never confided, and over whom they\r\nhave no powers of punishment or removal, let their crimes against the\r\nAmerican public be ever so great? Can any one reason be assigned, why\r\none hundred and sixty thousand electors in the island of Great Britain,\r\nshould give law to four millions in the States of America, every\r\nindividual of whom is equal to every individual of them in virtue,\r\nin understanding, and in bodily strength? Were this to be admitted,\r\ninstead of being a free people, as we have hitherto supposed, and mean\r\nto continue ourselves, we should suddenly be found the slaves, not of\r\none, but of one hundred and sixty thousand tyrants; distinguished, too,\r\nfrom all others, by this singular circumstance, that they are removed\r\nfrom the reach of fear, the only restraining motive which may hold the\r\nhand of a tyrant.\r\n\r\nThat, by 'an act to discontinue in such manner, and for such time as\r\nare therein mentioned, the landing and discharging, lading or shipping\r\nof goods, wares and merchandize, at the town and within the harbor of\r\nBoston, in the province of Massachusetts bay, in North America,'[25]\r\nwhich was past at the last session of the British Parliament, a large\r\nand populous town, whose trade was their sole subsistence, was deprived\r\nof that trade, and involved in utter ruin. Let us for a while, suppose\r\nthe question of right suspended, in order to examine this act on\r\nprinciples of justice. An act of Parliament had been passed, imposing\r\nduties on teas, to be paid in America, against which act the Americans\r\nhad protested, as inauthoritative. The East India Company, who till\r\nthat time, had never sent a pound of tea to America on their own\r\naccount, step forth on that occasion, the asserters of Parliamentary\r\nright, and send hither many ship loads of that obnoxious commodity. The\r\nmasters of their several vessels, however, on their arrival in America,\r\nwisely attended to admonition, and returned with their cargoes. In the\r\nprovince of New-England alone, the remonstrances of the people were\r\ndisregarded, and a compliance, after being many days waited for, was\r\nflatly refused. Whether in this, the master of the vessel was governed\r\nby his obstinacy, or his instructions, let those who know, say. There\r\nare extraordinary situations which require extraordinary interposition.\r\nAn exasperated people, who feel that they possess power, are not easily\r\nrestrained within limits strictly regular. A number of them assembled\r\nin the town of Boston, threw the tea into the ocean, and dispersed\r\nwithout doing any other act of violence. If in this they did wrong,\r\nthey were known, and were amenable to the laws of the land; against\r\nwhich, it could not be objected, that they had ever, in any instance,\r\nbeen obstructed or diverted from the regular course, in favor of\r\npopular offenders. They should, therefore, not have been distrusted\r\non this occasion. But that ill-fated colony had formerly been bold\r\nin their enmities against the House of Stuart, and were now devoted\r\nto ruin, by that unseen hand which governs the momentous affairs of\r\nthis great empire. On the partial representations of a few worthless\r\nministerial dependants, whose constant office it has been to keep that\r\ngovernment embroiled, and who, by their treacheries, hope to obtain the\r\ndignity of British knighthood, without calling for a party accused,\r\nwithout asking a proof, without attempting a distinction between the\r\nguilty and the innocent, the whole of that ancient and wealthy town, is\r\nin a moment reduced from opulence to beggary. Men who had spent their\r\nlives in extending the British commerce, who had invested, in that\r\nplace, the wealth their honest endeavors had merited, found themselves\r\nand their families, thrown at once on the world, for subsistence by\r\nits charities. Not the hundredth part of the inhabitants of that town,\r\nhad been concerned in the act complained of; many of them were in\r\nGreat Britain, and in other parts beyond sea; yet all were involved\r\nin one indiscriminate ruin, by a new executive power, unheard of till\r\nthen, that of a British Parliament. A property of the value of many\r\nmillions of money, was sacrificed to revenge, not repay, the loss of a\r\nfew thousands. This is administering justice with a heavy hand indeed!\r\nAnd when is this tempest to be arrested in its course? Two wharves are\r\nto be opened again when his Majesty shall think proper: the residue,\r\nwhich lined the extensive shores of the bay of Boston, are forever\r\ninterdicted the exercise of commerce. This little exception seems\r\nto have been thrown in for no other purpose, than that of setting a\r\nprecedent for investing his Majesty with legislative powers. If the\r\npulse of his people shall beat calmly under this experiment, another\r\nand another will be tried, till the measure of despotism be filled\r\nup. It would be an insult on common sense, to pretend that this\r\nexception was made, in order to restore its commerce to that great\r\ntown. The trade, which cannot be received at two wharves alone, must\r\nof necessity be transferred to some other place; to which it will soon\r\nbe followed by that of the two wharves. Considered in this light, it\r\nwould be an insolent and cruel mockery at the annihilation of the town\r\nof Boston. By the act for the suppression of riots and tumults in the\r\ntown of Boston,[26] passed also in the last session of Parliament, a\r\nmurder committed there, is, if the Governor pleases, to be tried in\r\nthe court of King's bench, in the island of Great Britain, by a jury\r\nof Middlesex. The witnesses, too, on receipt of such a sum as the\r\nGovernor shall think it reasonable for them to expend, are to enter\r\ninto recognizance to appear at the trial. This is, in other words,\r\ntaxing them to the amount of their recognizance; and that amount may\r\nbe whatever a Governor pleases. For who does his Majesty think can\r\nbe prevailed on to cross the Atlantic for the sole purpose of bearing\r\nevidence to a fact? His expenses are to be borne, indeed, as they shall\r\nbe estimated by a Governor; but who are to feed the wife and children\r\nwhom he leaves behind, and who have had no other subsistence but his\r\ndaily labor? Those epidemical disorders, too, so terrible in a foreign\r\nclimate, is the cure of them to be estimated among the articles of\r\nexpense, and their danger to be warded off by the Almighty power of a\r\nParliament? And the wretched criminal, if he happen to have offended\r\non the American side, stripped of his privilege of trial by peers of\r\nhis vicinage, removed from the place where alone full evidence could\r\nbe obtained, without money, without counsel, without friends, without\r\nexculpatory proof, is tried before Judges predetermined to condemn.\r\nThe cowards who would suffer a countryman to be torn from the bowels of\r\ntheir society, in order to be thus offered a sacrifice to Parliamentary\r\ntyranny, would merit that everlasting infamy now fixed on the authors\r\nof the act! A clause, for a similar purpose, had been introduced into\r\nan act passed in the twelfth year of his Majesty's reign, entitled, 'an\r\nact for the better securing and preserving his Majesty's Dock-yards,\r\nMagazines, Ships, Ammunition and Stores;' against which, as meriting\r\nthe same censures, the several colonies have already protested.\r\n\r\nThat these are the acts of power, assumed by a body of men foreign to\r\nour constitutions, and unacknowledged by our laws; against which we do,\r\non behalf of the inhabitants of British America, enter this, our solemn\r\nand determined protest. And we do earnestly intreat his Majesty, as\r\nyet the only mediatory power between the several States of the British\r\nempire, to recommend to his Parliament of Great Britain, the total\r\nrevocation of these acts, which, however nugatory they may be, may yet\r\nprove the cause of further discontents and jealousies among us.\r\n\r\nThat we next proceed to consider the conduct of his Majesty, as holding\r\nthe Executive powers of the laws of these States, and mark out his\r\ndeviations from the line of duty. By the Constitution of Great Britain,\r\nas well as of the several American States, his Majesty possesses the\r\npower of refusing to pass into a law, any bill which has already passed\r\nthe other two branches of the legislature. His Majesty, however, and\r\nhis ancestors, conscious of the impropriety of opposing their single\r\nopinion to the united wisdom of two Houses of Parliament, while their\r\nproceedings were unbiassed by interested principles, for several ages\r\npast, have modestly declined the exercise of this power, in that part\r\nof his empire called Great Britain. But, by change of circumstances,\r\nother principles than those of justice simply, have obtained an\r\ninfluence on their determinations. The addition of new States to\r\nthe British empire has produced an addition of new, and, sometimes,\r\nopposite interests. It is now, therefore, the great office of his\r\nMajesty to resume the exercise of his negative power, and to prevent\r\nthe passage of laws by any one legislature of the empire, which might\r\nbear injuriously on the rights and interests of another. Yet this will\r\nnot excuse the wanton exercise of this power, which we have seen his\r\nMajesty practice on the laws of the American legislature. For the most\r\ntrifling reasons, and, sometimes for no conceivable reason at all, his\r\nMajesty has rejected laws of the most salutary tendency. The abolition\r\nof domestic slavery is the great object of desire in those colonies,\r\nwhere it was, unhappily, introduced in their infant state. But previous\r\nto the enfranchisement of the slaves we have, it is necessary to\r\nexclude all further importations from Africa. Yet our repeated attempts\r\nto effect this, by prohibitions, and by imposing duties which might\r\namount to a prohibition, having been hitherto defeated by his Majesty's\r\nnegative: thus preferring the immediate advantages of a few British\r\ncorsairs, to the lasting interests of the American States, and to the\r\nrights of human nature, deeply wounded by this infamous practice. Nay,\r\nthe single interposition of an interested individual against a law was\r\nscarcely ever known to fail of success, though, in the opposite scale,\r\nwere placed the interests of a whole country. That this is so shameful\r\nan abuse of a power, trusted with his Majesty for other purposes, as\r\nif, not reformed, would call for some legal restrictions.\r\n\r\nWith equal inattention to the necessities of his people here has his\r\nMajesty permitted our laws to lie neglected, in England, for years,\r\nneither confirming them by his assent, nor annulling them by his\r\nnegative: so, that such of them as have no suspending clause, we hold\r\non the most precarious of all tenures, his Majesty's will; and such of\r\nthem as suspend themselves till his Majesty's assent be obtained, we\r\nhave feared might be called into existence at some future and distant\r\nperiod, when time and change of circumstances shall have rendered\r\nthem destructive to his people here. And, to render this grievance\r\nstill more oppressive, his Majesty, by his instructions, has laid\r\nhis Governors under such restrictions, that they can pass no law, of\r\nany moment, unless it have such suspending clause: so that, however\r\nimmediate may be the call for legislative interposition, the law cannot\r\nbe executed, till it has twice crossed the Atlantic, by which time the\r\nevil may have spent its whole force.\r\n\r\nBut in what terms reconcilable to Majesty, and at the same time to\r\ntruth, shall we speak of a late instruction to his Majesty's Governor\r\nof the colony of Virginia, by which he is forbidden to assent to any\r\nlaw for the division of a county, unless the new county will consent to\r\nhave no representative in Assembly? That colony has as yet affixed no\r\nboundary to the Westward. Their Western counties, therefore, are of an\r\nindefinite extent. Some of them are actually seated many hundred miles\r\nfrom their Eastern limits. Is it possible, then, that his Majesty can\r\nhave bestowed a single thought on the situation of those people, who in\r\norder to obtain justice for injuries, however great or small, must, by\r\nthe laws of that colony, attend their county court at such a distance,\r\nwith all their witnesses, monthly, till their litigation be determined?\r\nOr does his Majesty seriously wish, and publish it to the world, that\r\nhis subjects should give up the glorious right of representation, with\r\nall the benefits derived from that, and submit themselves the absolute\r\nslaves of his sovereign will? Or is it rather meant to confine the\r\nlegislative body to their present numbers, that they may be the cheaper\r\nbargain, whenever they shall become worth a purchase?\r\n\r\nOne of the articles of impeachment against Tresilian, and the other\r\nJudges of Westminster Hall, in the reign of Richard the Second, for\r\nwhich they suffered death, as traitors to their country, was, that\r\nthey had advised the King, that he might dissolve his Parliament at\r\nany time; and succeeding kings have adopted the opinion of these unjust\r\nJudges. Since the establishment, however, of the British constitution,\r\nat the glorious Revolution, on its free and ancient principles,\r\nneither his Majesty, nor his ancestors, have exercised such a power\r\nof dissolution in the island of Great Britain;[27] and when his\r\nMajesty was petitioned, by the united voice of his people there, to\r\ndissolve the present Parliament, who had become obnoxious to them, his\r\nMinisters were heard to declare, in open Parliament, that his Majesty\r\npossessed no such power by the constitution. But how different their\r\nlanguage, and his practice, here! To declare, as their duty required,\r\nthe known rights of their country, to oppose the usurpation of every\r\nforeign judicature, to disregard the imperious mandates of a Minister\r\nor Governor, have been the avowed causes of dissolving Houses of\r\nRepresentatives in America. But if such powers be really vested in his\r\nMajesty, can he suppose they are there placed to awe the members from\r\nsuch purposes as these? When the representative body have lost the\r\nconfidence of their constituents, when they have notoriously made sale\r\nof their most valuable rights, when they have assumed to themselves\r\npowers which the people never put into their hands, then, indeed, their\r\ncontinuing in office becomes dangerous to the State, and calls for an\r\nexercise of the power of dissolution. Such being the cause for which\r\nthe representative body should, and should not, be dissolved, will\r\nit not appear strange, to an unbiassed observer, that that of Great\r\nBritain was not dissolved, while those of the colonies have repeatedly\r\nincurred that sentence?\r\n\r\nBut your Majesty, or your Governors, have carried this power beyond\r\nevery limit known or provided for by the laws. After dissolving\r\none House of Representatives, they have refused to call another, so\r\nthat, for a great length of time, the legislature provided by the\r\nlaws, has been out of existence. From the nature of things, every\r\nsociety must, at all times, possess within itself the sovereign\r\npowers of legislation. The feelings of human nature revolt against\r\nthe supposition of a State so situated, as that it may not, in any\r\nemergency, provide against dangers which, perhaps, threaten immediate\r\nruin. While those bodies are in existence to whom the people have\r\ndelegated the powers of legislation, they alone possess, and may\r\nexercise, those powers. But when they are dissolved, by the lopping\r\noff one or more of their branches, the power reverts to the people, who\r\nmay use it to unlimited extent, either assembling together in person,\r\nsending deputies, or in any other way they may think proper. We forbear\r\nto trace consequences further; the dangers are conspicuous with which\r\nthis practice is replete.\r\n\r\nThat we shall, at this time also, take notice of an error in the nature\r\nof our land holdings, which crept in at a very early period of our\r\nsettlement. The introduction of the Feudal tenures into the kingdom\r\nof England, though ancient, is well enough understood to set this\r\nmatter in a proper light. In the earlier ages of the Saxon settlement,\r\nfeudal holdings were certainly altogether unknown, and very few, if\r\nany, had been introduced at the time of the Norman conquest. Our Saxon\r\nancestors held their lands, as they did their personal property, in\r\nabsolute dominion, disincumbered with any superior, answering nearly\r\nto the nature of those possessions which the Feudalist term Allodial.\r\nWilliam the Norman, first introduced that system generally. The lands\r\nwhich had belonged to those who fell in the battle of Hastings, and\r\nin the subsequent insurrections of his reign, formed a considerable\r\nproportion of the lands of the whole kingdom. These he granted out,\r\nsubject to feudal duties, as did he also those of a great number of\r\nhis new subjects, who, by persuasions or threats, were induced to\r\nsurrender them for that purpose. But still, much was left in the hands\r\nof his Saxon subjects, held of no superior, and not subject to feudal\r\nconditions. These, therefore, by express laws, enacted to render\r\nuniform the system of military defence, were made liable to the same\r\nmilitary duties as if they had been feuds; and the Norman lawyers soon\r\nfound means to saddle them, also, with the other feudal burthens. But\r\nstill they had not been surrendered to the King, they were not derived\r\nfrom his grant, and therefore they were not holden of him. A general\r\nprinciple was introduced, that \"all lands in England were held either\r\nmediately or immediately of the Crown;\" but this was borrowed from\r\nthose holdings which were truly feudal, and only applied to others\r\nfor the purposes of illustration. Feudal holdings were, therefore, but\r\nexceptions out of the Saxon laws of possession, under which all lands\r\nwere held in absolute right. These, therefore, still form the basis\r\nor groundwork of the Common law, to prevail wheresoever the exceptions\r\nhave not taken place. America was not conquered by William the Norman,\r\nnor its lands surrendered to him or any of his successors. Possessions\r\nthere are, undoubtedly, of the Allodial nature. Our ancestors, however,\r\nwho migrated hither, were laborers, not lawyers. The fictitious\r\nprinciple, that all lands belong originally to the King, they were\r\nearly persuaded to believe real, and accordingly took grants of their\r\nown lands from the Crown. And while the Crown continued to grant for\r\nsmall sums and on reasonable rents, there was no inducement to arrest\r\nthe error, and lay it open to public view. But his Majesty has lately\r\ntaken on him to advance the terms of purchase and of holding, to the\r\ndouble of what they were; by which means, the acquisition of lands\r\nbeing rendered difficult, the population of our country is likely to\r\nbe checked. It is time, therefore, for us to lay this matter before\r\nhis Majesty, and to declare, that he has no right to grant lands of\r\nhimself. From the nature and purpose of civil institutions, all the\r\nlands within the limits, which any particular party has circumscribed\r\naround itself, are assumed by that society, and subject to their\r\nallotment; this may be done by themselves assembled collectively, or by\r\ntheir legislature, to whom they may have delegated sovereign authority,\r\nand, if they are allotted in neither of these ways, each individual of\r\nthe society, may appropriate to himself such lands as he finds vacant,\r\nand occupancy will give him title.\r\n\r\nThat, in order to enforce the arbitrary measures before complained\r\nof, his Majesty has, from time to time, sent among us large bodies\r\nof armed forces, not made up of the people here, nor raised by the\r\nauthority of our laws. Did his Majesty possess such a right as this,\r\nit might swallow up all our other rights, whenever he should think\r\nproper. But his Majesty has no right to land a single armed man on our\r\nshores; and those whom he sends here are liable to our laws, for the\r\nsuppression and punishment of riots, routs, and unlawful assemblies,\r\nor are hostile bodies invading us in defiance of law. When, in the\r\ncourse of the late war, it became expedient that a body of Hanoverian\r\ntroops should be brought over for the defence of Great Britain, his\r\nMajesty's grandfather, our late sovereign, did not pretend to introduce\r\nthem under any authority he possessed. Such a measure would have given\r\njust alarm to his subjects of Great Britain, whose liberties would not\r\nbe safe if armed men of another country, and of another spirit, might\r\nbe brought into the realm at any time, without the consent of their\r\nlegislature. He, therefore, applied to Parliament, who passed an act\r\nfor that purpose, limiting the number to be brought in, and the time\r\nthey were to continue. In like manner is his Majesty restrained in\r\nevery part of the empire. He possesses indeed the executive power of\r\nthe laws in every State; but they are the laws of the particular State,\r\nwhich he is to administer within that State, and not those of any one\r\nwithin the limits of another. Every State must judge for itself, the\r\nnumber of armed men which they may safely trust among them, of whom\r\nthey are to consist, and under what restrictions they are to be laid.\r\nTo render these proceedings still more criminal against our laws,\r\ninstead of subjecting the military to the civil power, his majesty\r\nhas expressly made the civil subordinate to the military. But can his\r\nMajesty thus put down all law under his feet? Can he erect a power\r\nsuperior to that which erected himself? He has done it indeed by force;\r\nbut let him remember that force cannot give right.\r\n\r\nThat these are our grievances, which we have thus laid before his\r\nMajesty, with that freedom of language and sentiment which becomes a\r\nfree people, claiming their rights as derived from the laws of nature,\r\nand not as the gift of their Chief Magistrate. Let those flatter,\r\nwho fear: it is not an American art. To give praise where it is not\r\ndue might be well from the venal, but would ill beseem those who are\r\nasserting the rights of human nature. They know, and will, therefore,\r\nsay, that Kings are the servants, not the proprietors of the people.\r\nOpen your breast, Sire, to liberal and expanded thought. Let not the\r\nname of George the third, be a blot on the page of history. You are\r\nsurrounded by British counsellors, but remember that they are parties.\r\nYou have no ministers for American affairs, because you have none\r\ntaken from among us, nor amenable to the laws on which they are to\r\ngive you advice. It behoves you, therefore, to think and to act for\r\nyourself and your people. The great principles of right and wrong\r\nare legible to every reader; to pursue them, requires not the aid\r\nof many counsellors. The whole art of government consists in the art\r\nof being honest. Only aim to do your duty, and mankind will give you\r\ncredit where you fail. No longer persevere in sacrificing the rights\r\nof one part of the empire to the inordinate desires of another; but\r\ndeal out to all, equal and impartial right. Let no act be passed by\r\nany one legislature, which may infringe on the rights and liberties\r\nof another. This is the important post in which fortune has placed\r\nyou, holding the balance of a great, if a well-poised empire. This,\r\nSire, is the advice of your great American council, on the observance\r\nof which may perhaps depend your felicity and future fame, and the\r\npreservation of that harmony which alone can continue, both to Great\r\nBritain and America, the reciprocal advantages of their connection.\r\nIt is neither our wish nor our interest to separate from her. We are\r\nwilling, on our part, to sacrifice everything which reason can ask, to\r\nthe restoration of that tranquillity for which all must wish. On their\r\npart, let them be ready to establish union on a generous plan. Let\r\nthem name their terms, but let them be just. Accept of every commercial\r\npreference it is in our power to give, for such things as we can raise\r\nfor their use, or they make for ours. But let them not think to exclude\r\nus from going to other markets to dispose of those commodities which\r\nthey cannot use, nor to supply those wants which they cannot supply.\r\nStill less, let it be proposed, that our properties, within our own\r\nterritories, shall be taxed or regulated by any power on earth, but\r\nour own. The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time:\r\nthe hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them. This, Sire, is\r\nour last, our determined resolution. And that you will be pleased to\r\ninterpose, with that efficacy which your earnest endeavors may insure,\r\nto procure redress of these our great grievances, to quiet the minds\r\nof your subjects in British America against any apprehensions of future\r\nencroachment, to establish fraternal love and harmony through the whole\r\nempire, and that that may continue to the latest ages of time, is the\r\nfervent prayer of all British America.\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE D.]\r\n\r\n                                                           August, 1774.\r\n\r\n_Instructions for the Deputies appointed to meet in General Congress on\r\nthe part of this Colony._\r\n\r\nThe unhappy disputes between Great Britain and her American colonies,\r\nwhich began about the third year of the reign of his present Majesty,\r\nand since, continually increasing, have proceeded to lengths so\r\ndangerous and alarming, as to excite just apprehensions in the minds\r\nof his Majesty's faithful subjects of this colony, that they are in\r\ndanger of being deprived of their natural, ancient, constitutional,\r\nand chartered rights, have compelled them to take the same into their\r\nmost serious consideration; and, being deprived of their usual and\r\naccustomed mode of making known their grievances, have appointed\r\nus their representatives to consider what is proper to be done in\r\nthis dangerous crisis of American affairs. It being our opinion that\r\nthe united wisdom of North America should be collected in a General\r\nCongress of all the colonies, we have appointed the Honorable Peyton\r\nRandolph, Richard Henry Lee, George Washington, Patrick Henry, Richard\r\nBland, Benjamin Harrison, and Edmund Pendleton, Esquires, deputies to\r\nrepresent this colony in the said Congress, to be held at Philadelphia,\r\non the first Monday in September next.\r\n\r\nAnd that they may be the better informed of our sentiments, touching\r\nthe conduct we wish them to observe on this important occasion, we\r\ndesire that they will express, in the first place, our faith and true\r\nallegiance to his Majesty, King George the third, our lawful and\r\nrightful sovereign; and that we are determined, with our lives and\r\nfortunes, to support him in the legal exercise of all his just rights\r\nand prerogatives. And, however misrepresented, we sincerely approve\r\nof a constitutional connection with Great Britain, and wish, most\r\nardently, a return of that intercourse of affection and commercial\r\nconnection, that formerly united both countries, which can only be\r\neffected by a removal of those causes of discontent, which have of late\r\nunhappily divided us.\r\n\r\nIt cannot admit of a doubt, but the British subjects in America are\r\nentitled to the same rights and privileges as their fellow subjects\r\npossess in Britain; and therefore, that the power assumed by the\r\nBritish Parliament to bind America by their statutes _in all cases_\r\nwhatsoever, is unconstitutional, and the source of these unhappy\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nThe end of government would be defeated by the British Parliament\r\nexercising a power over the lives, the property, and the liberty of\r\nAmerican subjects, who are not, and, from their local circumstances,\r\ncannot be, there represented. Of this nature, we consider the several\r\nacts of Parliament for raising a revenue in America, for extending the\r\njurisdiction of the courts of Admiralty, for seizing American subjects,\r\nand transporting them to Britain to be tried for crimes committed in\r\nAmerica, and the several late oppressive acts respecting the town of\r\nBoston, and Province of the Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\nThe original constitution of the American colonies possessing their\r\nassemblies with the sole right of directing their internal polity, it\r\nis absolutely destructive of the end of their institution, that their\r\nlegislatures should be suspended, or prevented, by hasty dissolutions,\r\nfrom exercising their legislative powers.\r\n\r\nWanting the protection of Britain, we have long acquiesced in their\r\nacts of navigation, restrictive of our commerce, which we consider as\r\nan ample recompense for such protection; but as those acts derive their\r\nefficacy from that foundation alone, we have reason to expect they will\r\nbe restrained, so as to produce the reasonable purposes of Britain, and\r\nnot injurious to us.\r\n\r\nTo obtain redress of these grievances, without which the people of\r\nAmerica can neither be safe, free, nor happy, they are willing to\r\nundergo the great inconvenience that will be derived to them, from\r\nstopping all imports whatever, from Great Britain, after the first day\r\nof November next, and also to cease exporting any commodity whatsoever,\r\nto the same place, after the tenth day of August, 1775. The earnest\r\ndesire we have to make as quick and full payment as possible of our\r\ndebts to Great Britain, and to avoid the heavy injury that would\r\narise to this country from an earlier adoption of the non-exportation\r\nplan, after the people have already applied so much of their labor\r\nto the perfecting of the present crop, by which means, they have been\r\nprevented from pursuing other methods of clothing and supporting their\r\nfamilies, have rendered it necessary to restrain you in this article of\r\nnon-exportation; but it is our desire, that you cordially co-operate\r\nwith our sister colonies in General Congress, in such other just and\r\nproper methods as they, or the majority, shall deem necessary for the\r\naccomplishment of these valuable ends.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation issued by General Gage, in the government of the\r\nProvince of the Massachusetts Bay, declaring it treason for the\r\ninhabitants of that province to assemble themselves to consider of\r\ntheir grievances, and form associations for their common conduct on the\r\noccasion, and requiring the civil magistrates and officers to apprehend\r\nall such persons, to be tried for their supposed offences, is the\r\nmost alarming process that ever appeared in a British government; and\r\nthe said General Gage hath, thereby, assumed, and taken upon himself,\r\npowers denied by the constitution to our legal sovereign; that he,\r\nnot having condescended to disclose by what authority he exercises\r\nsuch extensive and unheard of powers, we are at a loss to determine,\r\nwhether he intends to justify himself as the representative of the\r\nKing, or as the Commander-in-Chief of his Majesty's forces in America.\r\nIf he considers himself as acting in the character of his Majesty's\r\nrepresentative, we would remind him that the statute 25th, Edward\r\nthe third has expressed and defined all treasonable offences, and\r\nthat the legislature of Great Britain had declared, that no offence\r\nshall be construed to be treason, but such as is pointed out by that\r\nstatute, and that this was done to take out of the hands of tyrannical\r\nKings, and of weak and wicked Ministers, that deadly weapon, which\r\nconstructive treason had furnished them with, and which had drawn the\r\nblood of the best and honestest men in the kingdom; and that the King\r\nof Great Britain hath no right by his proclamation, to subject his\r\npeople to imprisonment, pains, and penalties.\r\n\r\nThat if the said General Gage conceives he is empowered to act in this\r\nmanner, as the Commander-in-Chief of his Majesty's forces in America,\r\nthis odious and illegal proclamation must be considered as a plain\r\nand full declaration, that this despotic Viceroy will be bound by no\r\nlaw, nor regard the constitutional rights of his Majesty's subjects,\r\nwhenever they interfere with the plan he has formed for oppressing\r\nthe good people of the Massachusetts Bay; and, therefore, that the\r\nexecuting, or attempting to execute, such proclamations, will justify\r\nresistance and reprisal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE E.]\r\n\r\n                                           Monticello, November 1. 1778.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have got through the bill for \"proportioning crimes and punishments\r\nin cases heretofore capital,\" and now enclose it to you with a request\r\nthat you will be so good, as scrupulously to examine and correct\r\nit, that it may be presented to our committee with as few defects\r\nas possible. In its style, I have aimed at accuracy, brevity, and\r\nsimplicity, preserving, however, the very words of the established\r\nlaw, wherever their meaning had been sanctioned by judicial decisions,\r\nor rendered technical by usage. The same matter, if couched in the\r\nmodern statutory language, with all its tautologies, redundancies,\r\nand circumlocutions, would have spread itself over many pages, and\r\nbeen unintelligible to those whom it most concerns. Indeed, I wished\r\nto exhibit a sample of reformation in the barbarous style into which\r\nmodern statutes have degenerated from their ancient simplicity. And I\r\nmust pray you to be as watchful over what I have not said, as what is\r\nsaid; for the omissions of this bill have all their positive meaning.\r\nI have thought it better to drop, in silence, the laws we mean to\r\ndiscontinue, and let them be swept away by the general negative words\r\nof this, than to detail them in clauses of express repeal. By the side\r\nof the text I have written the notes I made, as I went along, for the\r\nbenefit of my own memory. They may serve to draw your attention to\r\nquestions, to which the expressions or the omissions of the text may\r\ngive rise. The extracts from the Anglo-Saxon laws, the sources of the\r\nCommon law, I wrote in their original, for my own satisfaction;[28] but\r\nI have added Latin, or liberal English translations. From the time of\r\nCanute to that of the Magna Charta, you know, the text of our statutes\r\nis preserved to us in Latin only, and some old French.\r\n\r\nI have strictly observed the scale of punishments settled by the\r\nCommittee, without being entirely satisfied with it. The _Lex\r\ntalionis_, although a restitution of the Common law, to the simplicity\r\nof which we have generally found it so advantageous to return, will\r\nbe revolting to the humanized feelings of modern times. An eye for an\r\neye, and a hand for a hand, will exhibit spectacles in execution whose\r\nmoral effect would be questionable; and even the _membrum pro membro_\r\nof Bracton, or the punishment of the offending member, although long\r\nauthorized by our law, for the same offence in a slave has, you know,\r\nbeen not long since repealed, in conformity with public sentiment. This\r\nneeds reconsideration.\r\n\r\nI have heard little of the proceedings of the Assembly, and do not\r\nexpect to be with you till about the close of the month. In the\r\nmeantime, present me respectfully to Mrs. Wythe, and accept assurances\r\nof the affectionate esteem and respect of, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n                        Your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n    George Wythe, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Bill for proportioning Crimes and Punishments, in cases heretofore\r\nCapital._\r\n\r\nWhereas, it frequently happens that wicked and dissolute men, resigning\r\nthemselves to the dominion of inordinate passions, commit violations on\r\nthe lives, liberties, and property of others, and, the secure enjoyment\r\nof these having principally induced men to enter into society,\r\ngovernment would be defective in its principal purpose, were it not to\r\nrestrain such criminal acts, by inflicting due punishments on those who\r\nperpetrate them; but it appears, at the same time, equally deducible\r\nfrom the purposes of society, that a member thereof, committing an\r\ninferior injury, does not wholly forfeit the protection of his fellow\r\ncitizens, but, after suffering a punishment in proportion to his\r\noffence, is entitled to their protection from all greater pain, so that\r\nit becomes a duty in the legislature to arrange, in a proper scale,\r\nthe crimes which it may be necessary for them to repress, and to adjust\r\nthereto a corresponding gradation of punishments.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, the reformation of offenders, though an object worthy\r\nthe attention of the laws, is not effected at all by capital\r\npunishments, which exterminate instead of reforming, and should be\r\nthe last melancholy resource against those whose existence is become\r\ninconsistent with the safety of their fellow citizens, which also\r\nweaken the State, by cutting off so many who, if reformed, might\r\nbe restored sound members to society, who, even under a course of\r\ncorrection, might be rendered useful in various labors for the public,\r\nand would be living and long-continued spectacles to deter others from\r\ncommitting the like offences.\r\n\r\nAnd forasmuch as the experience of all ages and countries hath shown,\r\nthat cruel and sanguinary laws defeat their own purpose, by engaging\r\nthe benevolence of mankind to withhold prosecutions, to smother\r\ntestimony, or to listen to it with bias, when, if the punishment were\r\nonly proportioned to the injury, men would feel it their inclination,\r\nas well as their duty, to see the laws observed.\r\n\r\nFor rendering crimes and punishments, therefore, more proportionate to\r\neach other:\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the General Assembly, that no crime shall be\r\nhenceforth punished by the deprivation of life or limb,[29] except\r\nthose hereinafter ordained to be so punished.\r\n\r\n[30]If a man do levy war[31] against the Commonwealth [_in the\r\nsame_], or be adherent to the enemies of the Commonwealth [_within\r\nthe same_],[32] giving to them aid or comfort in the Commonwealth, or\r\nelsewhere, and thereof be convicted of open deed, by the evidence of\r\ntwo sufficient witnesses, or his own voluntary confession, the said\r\ncases, and no[33] others, shall be adjudged treasons which extend to\r\nthe Commonwealth, and the person so convicted shall suffer death, by\r\nhanging,[34] and shall forfeit his lands and goods to the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nIf any person commit petty treason, or a husband murder his wife, a\r\nparent[35] his child, or a child his parent, he shall suffer death by\r\nhanging, and his body be delivered to Anatomists to be dissected.\r\n\r\nWhosoever committeth murder by poisoning shall suffer death by poison.\r\n\r\nWhosoever committeth murder by way of duel shall suffer death by\r\nhanging; and if he were the challenger, his body, after death, shall be\r\ngibbetted.[36] He who removeth it from the gibbet shall be guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor; and the officer shall see that it be replaced.\r\n\r\nWhosoever shall commit murder in any other way shall suffer death by\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\nAnd in all cases of Petty treason and murder, one half of the lands\r\nand goods of the offender, shall be forfeited to the next of kin\r\nto the person killed, and the other half descend and go to his own\r\nrepresentatives. Save only, where one shall slay the challenger in\r\na duel,[37] in which case, no part of his lands or goods shall be\r\nforfeited to the kindred of the party slain, but, instead thereof, a\r\nmoiety shall go to the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe same evidence[38] shall suffice, and order and course[39] of\r\ntrial be observed in cases of Petty treason, as in those of other[40]\r\nmurders.\r\n\r\nWhosoever shall be guilty of manslaughter,[41] shall, for the first\r\noffence, be condemned to hard[42] labor for seven years in the public\r\nworks, shall forfeit one half of his lands and goods to the next of kin\r\nto the person slain; the other half to be sequestered during such term,\r\nin the hands and to the use of the Commonwealth, allowing a reasonable\r\npart of the profits for the support of his family. The second offence\r\nshall be deemed murder.\r\n\r\nAnd where persons, meaning to commit a trespass[43] only, or larceny,\r\nor other unlawful deed, and doing an act from which involuntary\r\nhomicide hath ensued, have heretofore been adjudged guilty of\r\nmanslaughter, or of murder, by transferring such their unlawful\r\nintention to an act, much more penal than they could have in probable\r\ncontemplation;

That it be of _convenient size_ to be applied as a measure to the\r\ncommon money transactions of life.\r\n\r\nII. That its parts and multiples be in _an easy proportion_ to each\r\nother, so as to facilitate the money arithmetic.\r\n\r\nIII. That the Unit and its parts, or divisions, be _so nearly of the\r\nvalue of some of the known coins_, as that they may be of easy adoption\r\nfor the people.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Dollar seems to fulfil all these conditions.\r\n\r\nI. Taking into our view all money transactions, great and small,\r\nI question if a common measure of more _convenient size_ than the\r\nDollar could be proposed. The value of 100, 1000, 10,000 dollars is\r\nwell estimated by the mind; so is that of the tenth or the hundredth\r\nof a dollar. Few transactions are above or below these limits. The\r\nexpediency of attending to the size of the money Unit will be evident,\r\nto any one who will consider how inconvenient it would be to a\r\nmanufacturer or merchant, if, instead of the yard for measuring cloth,\r\neither the inch or the mile had been made the Unit of Measure.\r\n\r\nII. The most _easy ratio_ of multiplication and division, is that by\r\nten. Every one knows the facility of Decimal Arithmetic. Every one\r\nremembers, that, when learning Money-Arithmetic, he used to be puzzled\r\nwith adding the farthings, taking out the fours and carrying them on;\r\nadding the pence, taking out the twelves and carrying them on; adding\r\nthe shillings, taking out the twenties and carrying them on; but when\r\nhe came to the pounds, where he had only tens to carry forward, it was\r\neasy and free from error. The bulk of mankind are school-boys through\r\nlife. These little perplexities are always great to them. And even\r\nmathematical heads feel the relief of an easier, substituted for a\r\nmore difficult process. Foreigners, too, who trade and travel among\r\nus, will find a great facility in understanding our coins and accounts\r\nfrom this ratio of subdivision. Those who have had occasion to convert\r\nthe livres, sols, and deniers of the French; the gilders, stivers, and\r\nfrenings of the Dutch; the pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings of\r\nthese several States, into each other, can judge how much they would\r\nhave been aided, had their several subdivisions been in a decimal\r\nratio. Certainly, in all cases, where we are free to choose between\r\neasy and difficult modes of operation, it is most rational to choose\r\nthe easy. The Financier, therefore, in his report, well proposes that\r\nour Coins should be in decimal proportions to one another. If we adopt\r\nthe Dollar for our Unit, we should strike four coins, one of gold, two\r\nof silver, and one of copper, viz.:\r\n\r\n     1. A golden piece, equal in value to ten dollars:\r\n\r\n     2. The Unit or Dollar itself, of silver:\r\n\r\n     3. The tenth of a Dollar, of silver also:\r\n\r\n     4. The hundredth of a Dollar, of copper.\r\n\r\nCompare the arithmetical operations, on the same sum of money expressed\r\nin this form, and expressed in the pound sterling and its division.\r\n\r\n                   £ s. d. qrs.

The same difference arises in making payment.\r\nAn Englishman, to pay £8, 13_s._ 11_d._ 1-2 qrs., must find, by\r\ncalculation, what combination of the coins of his country will pay\r\nthis sum; but an American, having the same sum to pay, thus expressed\r\n$38.65, will know, by inspection only, that three golden pieces, eight\r\nunits or dollars, six tenths, and five coppers, pay it precisely.\r\n\r\nIII. The third condition required is, that the Unit, its multiples, and\r\nsubdivisions, coincide in value with some of the known coins so nearly,\r\nthat the people may, by a quick reference in the mind, estimate their\r\nvalue. If this be not attended to, they will be very long in adopting\r\nthe innovation, if ever they adopt it. Let us examine, in this point of\r\nview, each of the four coins proposed.\r\n\r\n1. The golden piece will be 1-5 more than a half joe, and 1-15 more\r\nthan a double guinea. It will be readily estimated, then, by reference\r\nto either of them; but more readily and accurately as equal to ten\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n2. The Unit, or Dollar, is a known coin, and the most familiar of all,\r\nto the minds of the people. It is already adopted from South to North;\r\nhas identified our currency, and therefore happily offers itself as a\r\nUnit already introduced. Our public debt, our requisitions, and their\r\nappointments, have given it actual and long possession of the place\r\nof Unit. The course of our commerce, too, will bring us more of this\r\nthan of any other foreign coin, and therefore renders it more worthy\r\nof attention. I know of no Unit which can be proposed in competition\r\nwith the Dollar, but the Pound. But what is the Pound? 1547 grains\r\nof fine silver in Georgia; 1289 grains in Virginia, Connecticut,\r\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire; 1031 1-4 grains in\r\nMaryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey; 966 3-4 grains in\r\nNorth Carolina and New York. Which of these shall we adopt? To which\r\nState give that pre-eminence of which all are so jealous? And on which\r\nimpose the difficulties of a new estimate of their corn, their cattle,\r\nand other commodities? Or shall we hang the pound sterling, as a common\r\nbadge, about all their necks? This contains 1718 3-4 grains of pure\r\nsilver. It is difficult to familiarize a new coin to the people; it\r\nis more difficult to familiarize them to a new coin with an old name.\r\nHappily, the dollar is familiar to them all, and is already as much\r\nreferred to for a measure of value, as their respective provincial\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n3. The tenth will be precisely the Spanish bit, or half pistereen. This\r\nis a coin perfectly familiar to us all. When we shall make a new coin,\r\nthen, equal in value to this, it will be of ready estimate with the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n4. The hundredth, or copper, will differ little from the copper of\r\nthe four Eastern States, which is 1-108 of a dollar; still less from\r\nthe penny of New York and North Carolina, which is 1-96 of a dollar;\r\nand somewhat more from the penny or copper of Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, and Maryland, which is 1-90 of a dollar.\r\n\r\nIt will be about the medium between the old and the new coppers of\r\nthese States, and will therefore soon be substituted for them both.\r\nIn Virginia, coppers have never been in use. It will be as easy,\r\ntherefore, to introduce them there of one value as of another. The\r\ncopper coin proposed will be nearly equal to three-fourths of their\r\npenny, which is the same with the penny lawful of the Eastern States.\r\n\r\nA great deal of small change is useful in a State, and tends to reduce\r\nthe price of small articles. Perhaps it would not be amiss to coin\r\nthree more pieces of silver, one of the value of five-tenths, or half\r\na dollar, one of the value of two-tenths, which would be equal to the\r\nSpanish pistereen, and one of the value of five coppers, which would be\r\nequal to the Spanish half-bit. We should then have five silver coins,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\n  1. The Unit or Dollar:\r\n\r\n  2. The half dollar or five-tenths:\r\n\r\n  3. The double tenth, equal to 2, or one-fifth of a dollar, or to\r\n    the pistereen:\r\n\r\n  4. The tenth, equal to a Spanish bit:\r\n\r\n  5. The five copper piece, equal to .5, or one-twentieth of a\r\n    dollar, or the half-bit.\r\n\r\nThe plan reported by the Financier is worthy of his sound judgment. It\r\nadmits, however, of objection, in the size of the Unit. He proposes\r\nthat this shall be the 1440th part of a dollar: so that it will\r\nrequire 1440 of his units to make the one before proposed. He was led\r\nto adopt this by a mathematical attention to our old currencies, all\r\nof which this Unit will measure without leaving a fraction. But as\r\nour object is to get rid of those currencies, the advantage derived\r\nfrom this coincidence will soon be past, whereas the inconveniences of\r\nthis Unit will forever remain, if they do not altogether prevent its\r\nintroduction. It is defective in two of the three requisites of a Money\r\nUnit. 1. It is inconvenient in its application to the ordinary money\r\ntransactions. 10.000 dollars will require eight figures to express\r\nthem, to wit 14,400,000 units. A horse or bullock of eighty dollars\r\nvalue, will require a notation of six figures, to wit, 115,200 units.\r\nAs a money of account, this will be laborious, even when facilitated\r\nby the aid of decimal arithmetic: as a common measure of the value of\r\nproperty, it will be too minute to be comprehended by the people. The\r\nFrench are subjected to very laborious calculations, the Livre being\r\ntheir ordinary money of account, and this but between l-5th and l-6th\r\nof a dollar; but what will be our labors, should our money of account\r\nbe 1-1440th of a dollar? 2. It is neither equal, nor near to any of the\r\nknown coins in value.\r\n\r\nIf we determine that a Dollar shall be our Unit, we must then say with\r\nprecision what a Dollar is. This coin, struck at different times, of\r\ndifferent weights and fineness, is of different values. Sir Isaac\r\nNewton's assay and representation to the Lords of the Treasury, in\r\n1717, of those which he examined, make their values as follows:\r\n\r\n                                    dwts. grs.\r\n\r\n     The Seville piece of eight     17--12 containing 387 grains of\r\n                                                      pure silver\r\n     The Mexico piece of eight      17--10 5-9 \"      385 1-2\r\n     The Pillar piece of eight      17--9      \"      385 3-4\r\n     The new Seville piece of eight 14--       \"      308 7-10\r\n\r\nThe Financier states the old Dollar as containing 376 grains of fine\r\nsilver, and the new 365 grains. If the Dollars circulating among us be\r\nof every date equally, we should examine the quantity of pure metal in\r\neach, and from them form an average for our Unit. This is a work proper\r\nto be committed to mathematicians as well as merchants, and which\r\nshould be decided on actual and accurate experiment.\r\n\r\nThe quantum of alloy is also to be decided. Some is necessary, to\r\nprevent the coin from wearing too fast; too much, fills our pockets\r\nwith copper, instead of silver. The silver coin assayed by Sir Isaac\r\nNewton, varied from 1 1-2 to 76 pennyweights alloy, in the pound troy\r\nof mixed metal. The British standard has 18 dwt.; the Spanish coins\r\nassayed by Sir Isaac Newton, have from 18 to 19 1-2 dwt.; the new\r\nFrench crown has in fact 19 1-2, though by edict, it should have 20\r\ndwt., that is 1-12.\r\n\r\nThe taste of our countrymen will require, that their furniture plate\r\nshould be as good as the British standard. Taste cannot be controlled\r\nby law. Let it then give the law, in a point which is indifferent to a\r\ncertain degree. Let the Legislature fix the alloy of furniture plate\r\nat 18 dwt., the British standard, and Congress that of their coin at\r\none ounce in the pound, the French standard. This proportion has been\r\nfound convenient for the alloy of gold coin, and it will simplify the\r\nsystem of our mint to alloy both metals in the same degree. The coin,\r\ntoo, being the least pure, will be the less easily melted into plate.\r\nThese reasons are light, indeed, and, of course, will only weigh, if no\r\nheavier ones can be opposed to them.\r\n\r\nThe proportion between the values of gold and silver is a mercantile\r\nproblem altogether. It would be inaccurate to fix it by the popular\r\nexchanges of a half Joe for eight dollars, a Louis for four French\r\ncrowns, or five Louis for twenty-three dollars. The first of these,\r\nwould be to adopt the Spanish proportion between gold and silver;\r\nthe second, the French; the third, a mere popular barter, wherein\r\nconvenience is consulted more than accuracy. The legal proportion\r\nin Spain is 16 for 1; in England, 15 1-2 for 1; in France, 15 for\r\n1. The Spaniards and English are found, in experience, to retain an\r\nover-proportion of gold coins, and to lose their silver. The French\r\nhave a greater proportion of silver. The difference at market has\r\nbeen on the decrease. The Financier states it at present, as at 14 1-2\r\nfor one. Just principles will lead us to disregard legal proportions\r\naltogether; to enquire into the market price of gold, in the several\r\ncountries with which we shall principally be connected in commerce, and\r\nto take an average from them. Perhaps we might, with safety, lean to a\r\nproportion somewhat above par for gold, considering our neighborhood,\r\nand commerce with the sources of the coins, and the tendency which\r\nthe high price of gold in Spain has, to draw thither all that of their\r\nmines, leaving silver principally for our and other markets. It is not\r\nimpossible that 15 for 1, may be found an eligible proportion. I state\r\nit, however, as a conjecture only.\r\n\r\nAs to the alloy for gold coin, the British is an ounce in the pound;\r\nthe French, Spanish, and Portuguese differ from that, only from a\r\nquarter of a grain, to a grain and a half. I should, therefore, prefer\r\nthe British, merely because its fraction stands in a more simple form,\r\nand facilitates the calculations into which it enters.\r\n\r\nShould the Unit be fixed at 365 grains of pure silver, gold at 15 for\r\n1, and the alloy of both be one-twelfth, the weight of the coins will\r\nbe as follows:\r\n\r\n                                       Grains.

Here the Legislatures should co-operate\r\nwith Congress, in providing that no money be received or paid at their\r\ntreasuries, or by any of their officers, or any bank, but on actual\r\nweight; in making it criminal, in a high degree, to diminish their\r\nown coins, and, in some smaller degree, to offer them in payment when\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nThat this subject may be properly prepared, and in readiness for\r\nCongress to take up at their meeting in November, something must now\r\nbe done. The present session drawing to a close, they probably would\r\nnot choose to enter far into this undertaking themselves. The Committee\r\nof the States, however, during the recess, will have time to digest\r\nit thoroughly, if Congress will fix some general principles for their\r\ngovernment. Suppose they be instructed,\r\n\r\nTo appoint proper persons to assay and examine, with the utmost\r\naccuracy practicable, the Spanish milled dollars of different dates, in\r\ncirculation with us.\r\n\r\nTo assay and examine, in like manner, the fineness of all the other\r\ncoins which may be found in circulation within these States.\r\n\r\nTo report to the Committee the result of these assays, by them to be\r\nlaid before Congress.\r\n\r\nTo appoint, also, proper persons to enquire what are the proportions\r\nbetween the values of fine gold, and fine silver, at the markets of\r\nthe several countries with which we are, or probably may be, connected\r\nin commerce; and what would be a proper proportion here, having\r\nregard to the average of their values at those markets, and to other\r\ncircumstances, and to report the same to the Committee, by them to be\r\nlaid before Congress.\r\n\r\nTo prepare an Ordinance for establishing the Unit of Money within these\r\nStates; for subdividing it; and for striking coins of gold, silver, and\r\ncopper, on the following principles:\r\n\r\nThat the Money Unit of these States shall be equal in value to a\r\nSpanish milled dollar containing so much fine silver as the assay,\r\nbefore directed, shall show to be contained, on an average, in dollars\r\nof the several dates in circulation with us.\r\n\r\nThat this Unit shall be divided into tenths and hundredths; that there\r\nshall be a coin of silver of the value of a Unit; one other of the same\r\nmetal, of the value of one-tenth of a Unit; one other of copper, of the\r\nvalue of the hundredth of a Unit.\r\n\r\nThat there shall be a coin of gold of the value of ten Units, according\r\nto the report before directed, and the judgment of the Committee\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nThat the alloy of the said coins of gold and silver, shall be equal in\r\nweight to one-eleventh part of the fine metal.\r\n\r\nThat there be proper devices for these coins.\r\n\r\nThat measures be proposed for preventing their diminution, and also\r\ntheir currency, and that of any others, when diminished.\r\n\r\nThat the several foreign coins be described and classed in the said\r\nOrdinance, the fineness of each class stated, and its value by weight\r\nestimated in Units and decimal parts of Units.\r\n\r\nAnd that the said draught of an Ordinance be reported to Congress at\r\ntheir next meeting, for their consideration and determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supplementary Explanations._\r\n\r\nThe preceding notes having been submitted to the consideration of the\r\nFinancier, he favored me with his opinion and observations on them,\r\nwhich render necessary the following supplementary explanations.\r\n\r\nI observed, in the preceding notes, that the true proportion of value\r\nbetween gold and silver was a mercantile problem altogether, and that,\r\nperhaps, fifteen for one, might be found an eligible proportion. The\r\nFinancier is so good as to inform me, that this would be higher than\r\nthe market would justify. Confident of his better information on this\r\nsubject, I recede from that idea.[76]\r\n\r\nHe also informs me, that the several coins, in circulation among us,\r\nhave been already assayed with accuracy, and the result published in\r\na work on that subject. The assay of Sir Isaac Newton had superseded,\r\nin my mind, the necessity of this operation as to the older coins,\r\nwhich were the subject of his examination. This later work, with equal\r\nreason, may be considered as saving the same trouble as to the latter\r\ncoins.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, I accede to the opinions of the Financier. On the other\r\nhand, he seems to concur with me, in thinking his smallest fractional\r\ndivision too minute for a Unit, and, therefore, proposes to transfer\r\nthat denomination to his largest silver coin, containing 1000 of the\r\nunits first proposed, and worth about 4s. 2d. lawful, or 25-36 of a\r\nDollar. The only question then remaining between us is, whether the\r\nDollar, or this coin, be best for the Unit. We both agree that _the\r\nease of adoption with the people_, is the thing to be aimed at.\r\n\r\n1. As to the Dollar, events have overtaken and superseded the question.\r\nIt is no longer a doubt whether the people can adopt it with ease;\r\nthey have adopted it, and will have to be turned out of that, into\r\nanother tract of calculation, if another Unit be assumed. They have\r\nnow two Units, which they use with equal facility, viz., the Pound of\r\ntheir respective State, and the Dollar. The first of these is peculiar\r\nto each State: the second, happily, common to all. In each State, the\r\npeople have an easy rule of converting the pound of their State into\r\ndollars, or dollars into pounds; and this is enough for them, without\r\nknowing how this may be done in every State of the Union. Such of them\r\nas live near enough the borders of their State to have dealings with\r\ntheir neighbors, learn also the rule of their neighbors: thus, in\r\nVirginia and the Eastern States, where the dollar is 6s. or 3-10 of\r\na pound, to turn pounds into dollars, they multiply by 10 and divide\r\nby 3. To turn dollars into pounds, they multiply by 3, and divide by\r\n10. Those in Virginia who live near to Carolina, where the dollar is\r\n8s. or 4-10 of a pound, learn the operation of that State, which is a\r\nmultiplication by 4, and division by 10, _et e converso_. Those who\r\nlive near Maryland, where the dollar is 7s. 6d. or 3-8 of a pound,\r\nmultiply by 3, and divide by 8, _et e converso_. All these operations\r\nare easy, and have been found, by experience, not too much for the\r\narithmetic of the people, when they have occasion to convert their old\r\nUnit into dollars, or the reverse.\r\n\r\n2. As to the Unit of the Financier; in the States where the dollars is\r\n3-10 of a pound, this Unit will be 5-24. Its conversion into the pound\r\nthen, will be by a multiplication of 5, and a division by 24. In the\r\nStates where the dollar is 3-8 of a pound, this Unit will be 25-96 of a\r\npound, and the operation must be to multiply by 25, and divide by 96,\r\n_et e converso_. Where the dollar is 4-10 of a pound, this Unit will\r\nbe 5-18. The simplicity of the fraction, and of course the facility\r\nof conversion and reconversion, is therefore against this Unit, and in\r\nfavor of the dollar, in every instance. The only advantage it has over\r\nthe dollar, is, that it will in every case express our farthing without\r\na remainder; whereas, though the dollar and its decimals will do this\r\nin many cases, it will not in all. But, even in these, by extending\r\nyour notation one figure further, to wit, to thousands, you approximate\r\nto perfect accuracy within less than the two-thousandth part of a\r\ndollar; an atom in money which every one would neglect. Against this\r\nsingle inconvenience, the other advantages of the dollar are more than\r\nsufficient to preponderate. This Unit will present to the people a new\r\ncoin, and whether they endeavor to estimate its value by comparing it\r\nwith a Pound, or with a Dollar, the Units they now possess, they will\r\nfind the fraction very compound, and of course less accommodated to\r\ntheir comprehension and habits than the dollar. Indeed the probability\r\nis, that they could never be led to compute in it generally.\r\n\r\nThe Financier supposes that the 1-100 part of a dollar is not\r\nsufficiently small, where the poor are purchasers or vendors. If it is\r\nnot, make a smaller coin. But I suspect that it is small enough. Let\r\nus examine facts, in countries where we are acquainted with them. In\r\nVirginia, where our towns are few, small, and of course their demand\r\nfor necessaries very limited, we have never yet been able to introduce\r\na copper coin at all. The smallest coin which anybody will receive\r\nthere, is the half-bit, or 1-20 of a dollar. In those States where\r\nthe towns are larger and more populous, a more habitual barter of\r\nsmall wants, has called for a copper coin of 1-90, 1-96, or 1-108 of\r\na dollar. In England, where the towns are many and populous, and where\r\nages of experience have matured the conveniences of intercourse, they\r\nhave found that some wants may be supplied for a farthing, or 1-208 of\r\na dollar, and they have accommodated a coin to this want. This business\r\nis evidently progressive. In Virginia, we are far behind. In some\r\nother States, they are further advanced, to wit, to the appreciation\r\nof 1-90, 1-96, 1-108 of a dollar. To this most advanced state, then, I\r\naccommodated my smallest coin in the decimal arrangement, as _a money\r\nof payment_, corresponding with the _money of account_. I have no doubt\r\nthe time will come when a smaller coin will be called for. When that\r\ncomes, let it be made. It will probably be the half of the copper I\r\nsuppose, that is to say, 5-1000 or .005 of a dollar, this being very\r\nnearly the farthing of England. But it will be time enough to make it,\r\nwhen the people shall be ready to receive it.\r\n\r\nMy proposition then, is, that our notation of money shall be decimal,\r\ndescending _ad libitum_ of the person noting; that the Unit of this\r\nnotation shall be a Dollar; that coins shall be accommodated to it\r\nfrom ten dollars to the hundredth of a dollar and that, to set this on\r\nfoot, the resolutions be adopted which were proposed in the notes, only\r\nsubstituting _an enquiry into the fineness of the coins_ in lieu of _an\r\nassay of them_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE G.]\r\n\r\nI have sometimes asked myself, whether my country is the better for\r\nmy having lived at all? I do not know that it is. I have been the\r\ninstrument of doing the following things; but they would have been done\r\nby others; some of them, perhaps, a little better.\r\n\r\nThe Rivanna had never been used for navigation; scarcely an empty\r\ncanoe had ever passed down it. Soon after I came of age, I examined its\r\nobstructions, set on foot a subscription for removing them, got an Act\r\nof Assembly passed, and the thing effected, so as to be used completely\r\nand fully for carrying down all our produce.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nI proposed the demolition of the church establishment, and the freedom\r\nof religion. It could only be done by degrees; to wit, the Act of 1776,\r\nc. 2. exempted dissenters from contributions to the Church, and left\r\nthe Church clergy to be supported by voluntary contributions of their\r\nown sect; was continued from year to year, and made perpetual 1779, c.\r\n36. I prepared the act for religious freedom in 1777, as part of the\r\nrevisal, which was not reported to the Assembly till 1779, and that\r\nparticular law not passed till 1785, and then by the efforts of Mr.\r\nMadison.\r\n\r\nThe act putting an end to entails.\r\n\r\nThe act prohibiting the importation of slaves.\r\n\r\nThe act concerning citizens, and establishing the natural right of man\r\nto expatriate himself, at will.\r\n\r\nThe act changing the course of descents, and giving the inheritance to\r\nall the children, &c., equally, I drew as part of the revisal.\r\n\r\nThe act for apportioning crimes and punishments, part of the same work,\r\nI drew. When proposed to the legislature, by Mr. Madison, in 1785, it\r\nfailed by a single vote. G. K. Taylor afterwards, in 1796, proposed\r\nthe same subject; avoiding the adoption of any part of the diction of\r\nmine, the text of which had been studiously drawn in the technical\r\nterms of the law, so as to give no occasion for new questions by\r\nnew expressions. When I drew mine, public labor was thought the best\r\npunishment to be substituted for death. But, while I was in France,\r\nI heard of a society in England, who had successfully introduced\r\nsolitary confinement, and saw the drawing of a prison at Lyons, in\r\nFrance, formed on the idea of solitary confinement. And, being applied\r\nto by the Governor of Virginia for the plan of a Capitol and Prison, I\r\nsent him the Lyons plan, accompanying it with a drawing on a smaller\r\nscale, better adapted to our use. This was in June, 1786. Mr. Taylor\r\nvery judiciously adopted this idea, (which had now been acted on in\r\nPhiladelphia, probably from the English model) and substituted labor in\r\nconfinement, to the public labor proposed by the Committee of revisal;\r\nwhich themselves would have done, had they been to act on the subject\r\nagain. The public mind was ripe for this in 1796, when Mr. Taylor\r\nproposed it, and ripened chiefly by the experiment in Philadelphia;\r\nwhereas, in 1785, when it had been proposed to our Assembly, they were\r\nnot quite ripe for it.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 and 1790, I had a great number of olive plants, of the best\r\nkind, sent from Marseilles to Charleston, for South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia. They were planted, and are flourishing; and, though not yet\r\nmultiplied, they will be the germ of that cultivation in those States.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, I got a cask of heavy upland rice, from the river Denbigh,\r\nin Africa, about lat. 9° 30' North, which I sent to Charleston, in\r\nhopes it might supersede the culture of the wet rice, which renders\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia so pestilential through the summer. It was\r\ndivided, and a part sent to Georgia. I know not whether it has been\r\nattended to in South Carolina; but it has spread in the upper parts\r\nof Georgia, so as to have become almost general, and is highly prized.\r\nPerhaps it may answer in Tennessee and Kentucky. The greatest service\r\nwhich can be rendered any country is, to add an useful plant to its\r\nculture; especially, a bread grain; next in value to bread is oil.\r\n\r\nWhether the act for the more general diffusion of knowledge will ever\r\nbe carried into complete effect, I know not. It was received by the\r\nlegislature with great enthusiasm at first; and a small effort was made\r\nin 1796, by the act to establish public schools, to carry a part of it\r\ninto effect, viz., that for the establishment of free English schools;\r\nbut the option given to the courts has defeated the intention of the\r\nact.[77]\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE H.]\r\n\r\n                                             New York, October 13, 1789.\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\nIn the selection of characters to fill the important offices of\r\nGovernment, in the United States, I was naturally led to contemplate\r\nthe talents and dispositions which I knew you to possess and entertain\r\nfor the service of your country; and without being able to consult\r\nyour inclination, or to derive any knowledge of your intention from\r\nyour letters, either to myself or to any other of your friends, I was\r\ndetermined, as well by motives of private regard, as a conviction of\r\npublic propriety, to nominate you for the Department of State, which,\r\nunder its present organization, involves many of the most interesting\r\nobjects of the Executive authority.

The convictions of\r\n     treason of that kind in England have been under that branch\r\n     of the statute which makes the compassing the king's death\r\n     treason. Foster 196. 197. But as we omit that branch, we must\r\n     by other means reach this flagrant case.\r\n\r\n     [33] The stat. 25.

As we drop\r\n     that part of the statute, we must, by negative words, prevent\r\n     an inundation of common law treasons. I strike out the word\r\n     \"it,\" therefore, and insert \"the said cases, and no others.\"\r\n     Quære, how far those negative words may affect the case of\r\n     accomplices above mentioned? Though if their case was within\r\n     the statute, so as that it needed not await the opinion of\r\n     Parliament, it should seem to be also within our act, so as\r\n     not to be ousted by the negative words.\r\n\r\n     [34] This implies \"by the neck.\" See 2 Hawk. 544. notes n. o.\r\n\r\n     [35] By the stat. 21. Jac. 1. c. 27. and Act Ass. 1170. c.\r\n     12. concealment by the mother of the death of a bastard child\r\n     is made murder. In justification of this, it is said, that\r\n     shame is a feeling which operates so strongly on the mind,\r\n     as frequently to induce the mother of such a child to murder\r\n     it, in order to conceal her disgrace. The act of concealment,\r\n     therefore, proves she was influenced by shame, and that\r\n     influence produces a presumption that she murdered the child.\r\n     The effect of this law then is, to make what, in its nature,\r\n     is only presumptive evidence of a murder conclusive of that\r\n     fact. To this I answer, 1. So many children die before or\r\n     soon after birth, that to presume all those murdered who are\r\n     found dead, is a presumption which will lead us oftener wrong\r\n     than right, and consequently would shed more blood than it\r\n     would save. 2. If the child were born dead, the mother would\r\n     naturally choose rather to conceal it, in hopes of still\r\n     keeping a good character in the neighborhood. So that the\r\n     act of concealment is far from proving the guilt of murder on\r\n     the mother. 3. If shame be a powerful affection of the mind,\r\n     is not parental love also? Is it not the strongest affection\r\n     known? Is it not greater than even that of self-preservation?\r\n     While we draw presumptions from shame, one affection of the\r\n     mind, against the life of the prisoner, should we not give\r\n     some weight to presumptions from parental love, an affection\r\n     at least as strong, in favor of life? If concealment of the\r\n     fact is a presumptive evidence of murder, so strong as to\r\n     overbalance all other evidence that may possibly be produced\r\n     to take away the presumption, why not trust the force of this\r\n     incontestable presumption to the jury, who are, in a regular\r\n     course, to hear presumptive, as well as positive testimony?\r\n     If the presumption arising from the act of concealment,\r\n     may be destroyed by proof positive or circumstantial to the\r\n     contrary, why should the legislature preclude that contrary\r\n     proof? Objection. The crime is difficult to prove, being\r\n     usually committed in secret. Answer. But circumstantial\r\n     proof will do; for example, marks of violence, the behavior,\r\n     countenance, &c. of the prisoner, &c. And if conclusive\r\n     proof be difficult to be obtained, shall we therefore fasten\r\n     irremovably upon equivocal proof? Can we change the nature of\r\n     what is contestable, and make it incontestable? Can we make\r\n     that conclusive which God and nature have made inconclusive?\r\n     Solon made no law against parricide, supposing it impossible\r\n     that any one could be guilty of it; and the Persians, from\r\n     the same opinion, adjudged all who killed their reputed\r\n     parents to be bastards; and although parental be yet stronger\r\n     than filial affection, we admit saticide proved on the most\r\n     equivocal testimony, whilst they rejected all proof of an\r\n     act certainly not more repugnant to nature, as of a thing\r\n     impossible, unprovable.

See More's Utopia\r\n     p. 50. for some good hints. Fugitives might, in such a\r\n     bill, be obliged to work two days for every one they absent\r\n     themselves.\r\n\r\n     [43] The shooting at a wild fowl, and killing a man, is\r\n     homicide by misadventure. Shooting at a pullet, without any\r\n     design to take it away, is manslaughter; and with a design\r\n     to take it away, is murder. 6 Sta. tr. 222. To shoot at the\r\n     poultry of another, and thereby set fire to his house, is\r\n     arson, in the opinion of some. Dalt. c. 116. 1. Hale's P.

The first are held to be totally\r\n     without guilt, or rather commendable. The second are in\r\n     some cases not quite unblamable. These should subject the\r\n     party to marks of contrition; viz., the killing of a man\r\n     in defence of property; so also in defence of one's person,\r\n     which is a species of excusable homicide; because, although\r\n     cases may happen where these also are commendable yet\r\n     most frequently they are done on too slight appearance of\r\n     danger; as in return for a blow, kick, fillip, &c.; or on a\r\n     person's getting into a house, not animo furandi, but perhaps\r\n     veneris causa, &c. Bracton says, \"si quis furem nocturnum\r\n     occident ita demum impune foret, si parcere ei sine periculo\r\n     suo non potuit, si autem potuit, aliter erit. Item erit\r\n     si quis hamsokne quae dicitur invasio domus contra pacem\r\n     domini regis in domo sua se defenderit, et invasor occisus\r\n     fuerit; impersecutus et insultus remanebit, si ille quem\r\n     invasit aliter se defendere non potuit; dicitur enim quod\r\n     non est dignus habere pacem qui non vult observare eam.\"\r\n     L. 3. c. 23. § 3. \"Qui latronem occiderit, non tenetur,\r\n     nocturnum vel diurnum, si aliter periculum evadere non\r\n     possit; tenetur tamen si possit. Item non tenetur si per\r\n     infortunium, et non animo et voluntate occidendi, nec dolus,\r\n     nec culpa ejus inveniatur.\" L. 3. c. 36. § 1. The stat. 24.\r\n     H. 8. c. 5. is therefore merely declaratory of the Common\r\n     law. See on the general subject Puffend. 2. 5. § 10. 11.\r\n     12. 16. 17. Excusable homicides are by misadventure, or in\r\n     self-defence. It is the opinion of some lawyers, that the\r\n     Common law punished these with death, and that the statute\r\n     of Marlbridge, c. 26. and Gloucester, c. 9. first took away\r\n     this by giving them title to a pardon, as matter of right,\r\n     and a writ of restitution of their goods. See 2. Inst. 148.\r\n     315. 3. Inst. 55. Bracton L. 3. c. 4. § 2. Fleta L. 1. c.\r\n     23. § 14. 15. 21. E. 3. 23. But it is believed never to have\r\n     been capital. 1. H. P. C. 425. 1 Hawk. 75. Foster, 282. 4.\r\n     Bl. 188. It seems doubtful also, whether at Common law, the\r\n     party forfeited all his chattels in this case, or only paid\r\n     a weregild. Foster, ubi supra, doubts, and thinks it of no\r\n     consequence, as the statute of Gloucester entitles the party\r\n     to Royal grace, which goes as well to forfeiture as life.\r\n     To me there seems no reason for calling these excusable\r\n     homicides, and the killing a man in defence of property,\r\n     a justifiable homicide. The latter is less guiltless than\r\n     misadventure or self-defence.\r\n\r\n     Suicide is by law punishable by forfeiture of chattels.\r\n     This bill exempts it from forfeiture. The suicide injures\r\n     the State less than he who leaves it with his effects. If\r\n     the latter then be not punished, the former should not.\r\n     As to the example, we need not fear its influence. Men are\r\n     too much attached to life, to exhibit frequent instances of\r\n     depriving themselves of it. At any rate, the quasi-punishment\r\n     of confiscation will not prevent it. For if one be found\r\n     who can calmly determine to renounce life, who is so weary\r\n     of his existence here, as rather to make experiment of what\r\n     is beyond the grave, can we suppose him, in such a state of\r\n     mind, susceptible of influence from the losses to his family\r\n     from confiscation? That men in general, too, disapprove of\r\n     this severity, is apparent from the constant practice of\r\n     juries finding the suicide in a state of insanity; because\r\n     they have no other way of saving the forfeiture. Let it then\r\n     be done away.\r\n\r\n     [45] Beccaria. § 19. 25. G. 2. c. 37.\r\n\r\n     [46] 13. E. 1. e. 34. Forcible abduction of a woman having\r\n     substance, is felony by 3.

Eliz. e. 6. says, \"For plain declaration of law, be it\r\n     enacted, that if any person shall unlawfully and carnally\r\n     know and abuse any woman child, under the age of ten years,\r\n     &c., he shall suffer as a felon, without allowance of\r\n     clergy.\" Lord Hale, however, 1. P. C. 630. thinks it rape\r\n     independent of that statute, to know carnally, a girl under\r\n     twelve, the age of consent. Yet 4. Bl. 212. seems to neglect\r\n     this opinion; and as it was founded on the words of 3. E. 1.\r\n     e. 13. and this is with us omitted, the offence of carnally\r\n     knowing a girl under twelve, or ten years of age, will not be\r\n     distinguished from that of any other.\r\n\r\n     [47] 1.

Bestiality\r\n     can never make any progress; it cannot therefore be injurious\r\n     to society in any great degree, which is the true measure\r\n     of criminality in foro civili, and will ever be properly and\r\n     severely punished, by universal derision. It may, therefore;\r\n     be omitted. It was anciently punished with death, as it\r\n     has been latterly. Ll. Aelfrid. 31. and 25. H. 8. c. 6. see\r\n     Beccaria. § 31.

Burglary and\r\n     House-breaking were called \"Hamsockne diximus etiam de\r\n     pacis violatione et de immunitatibus domus, si quis hoc in\r\n     posterum fecerit ut perdat omne quod habet, et sit in regis\r\n     arbitrio utrum vitam habeat.

Eadmundi.\r\n     c. 6. and see Ll. Cnuti. 61. \"hus brec,\" in notes on Arson.\r\n     ante. A Burglar was also called a Burgessor. \"Et soit enquis\r\n     de Burgessours et sunt tenus Burgessours trestous ceux que\r\n     _felonisement_ en temps de pees debrusout esglises ou auter\r\n     mesons, ou murs ou portes de nos cytes, ou de nos Burghes.\"\r\n     Britt. c. 10. \"Burglaria est nocturna diruptio habitaculi\r\n     alicujus, vel ecclesiae, etiam murorum, partarumve civitatis\r\n     aut burgi, ad feloniam aliquam perpetrandam. _Noctanter_\r\n     dico, recentiores secutus; veteres enim hoc non adjungunt.\r\n     Spelm. gloss. verb. Burglaria. It was punished with death.\r\n     Ib. citn. from the office of a Coroner. It may be committed\r\n     in the outset houses, as well as inset. 3 Inst. 65. though\r\n     not under the same roof or contiguous, provided they be\r\n     within the Curtilage or Homestall. 4 Bl. 225. As by the\r\n     Common law, all felonies were clergiable, the stat. 23 H.\r\n     8. c. 1. 5. E. 6. c. 9. and 18 El. c. 7. first distinguished\r\n     them, by taking the clerical privilege of impunity from the\r\n     principals, and 3. 4. W. M. c. 9. from accessories before the\r\n     fact. No _statute_ defines what Burglary is. The 12 Ann. c.\r\n     7. decides the doubt whether, where breaking is subsequent to\r\n     entry, it is Burglary. Bacon's Elements had affirmed, and 1.\r\n     H. P. C. 554. had denied it. Our bill must distinguish them\r\n     by different degrees of punishment.\r\n\r\n     [60] At the Common law, the offence of Housebreaking was\r\n     not distinguished from Burglary, and neither of them from\r\n     any other larceny. The statutes at first took away clergy\r\n     from Burglary, which made a leading distinction between the\r\n     two offences. Later statutes, however, have taken clergy\r\n     from so many cases of Housebreaking, as nearly to bring\r\n     the offences together again. These are 23 H. 8. c. 1. 1.\r\n     E. 6. c. 12. 5 and 6 E. 6. c. 9. 3 and 4 W. M. c. 9. 39\r\n     El. c. 15. 10 and 11 W. 3 c. 23. 12 Ann. c. 7. See Barr.\r\n     428. 4 Bl. 240. The circumstances which in these statutes\r\n     characterize the offence, seem to have been occasional\r\n     and unsystematical. The houses on which Burglary may be\r\n     committed, and the circumstances which constitute that crime\r\n     being ascertained, it will be better to define Housebreaking\r\n     by the same subjects and circumstances, and let the crimes be\r\n     distinguished only by the hour at which they are committed,\r\n     and the degree of punishment.\r\n\r\n     [61] The offence of Horse-stealing seems properly\r\n     distinguishable from other larcenies, here, where these\r\n     animals generally run at large, the temptation being so great\r\n     and frequent, and the facility of commission so remarkable.\r\n     See 1 E. 6. c. 12. 23 E. 6. c. 33. 31 El. c. 12.\r\n\r\n     [62] The distinction between grand and petty larceny, is very\r\n     ancient. At first 8d. was the sum which constituted grand\r\n     larceny. Ll. Aethelst. c. 1. \"Ne parcatur ulli furi, qui\r\n     furtum manutenens captus sit, supra 12. annos nato, et supra\r\n     8. denarios.\" Afterwards, in the same king's reign it was\r\n     raised to 12d. \"non parcatur alicui furi ultra 12 denarios,\r\n     et ultra 12 annos nato--ut occidemus illum et capiamus omne\r\n     quod possidet, et imprimis sumamus rei furto ablatae pretium\r\n     ab haerede, ac dividatur postea reliquum in duas partes,\r\n     una pars uxori, si munda, et facinoris conscia non sit; et\r\n     residuum in duo, dimidium capiat rex, dimidium societas.\" Ll.\r\n     Aethelst. Wilkins, p. 65.\r\n\r\n     [63] Ll. Inae. c. 7. \"Si quis furetur ita ut uxor ejus et\r\n     infans ipsius nesciant, solvat 60. solidos poenae loco. Si\r\n     autem furetur testantibus omnibus haeredibus suis, _abeant\r\n     omnes in servitutem_.\" Ina was king of the West-Saxons,\r\n     and began to reign A. C. 688. After the union of the\r\n     Heptarchy, i. e. temp. Aethelst. inter 924 and 940, we find\r\n     it punishable with death as above. So it was inter 1017 and\r\n     1035, i. e. temp. Cnuti. Ll. Cnuti 61. cited in notes on\r\n     Arson. In the time of William the conqueror, it seems to\r\n     have been made punishable by fine only. Ll. Gul. conq. apud\r\n     Wilk. p. 218, 220. This commutation, however, was taken away\r\n     by Ll. H. 1. anno 1108. \"Si quis in furto vel latrocinio\r\n     deprehensus fuisset, suspenderetur; sublata wirgildorum, id\r\n     est, pecuniarae redemptionis lege.\" Larceny is the felonious\r\n     taking and carrying away of the personal goods of another. 1.\r\n     As to the taking, the 3. 4. W. M. c. 9 § 5. is not additional\r\n     to the Common law, but declaratory of it; because where\r\n     only the care or use, and not the possession, of things is\r\n     delivered, to take them was larceny at the Common law. The\r\n     33. H. 6. c. 1. and 21 H. 8. c. 7. indeed, have added to\r\n     the Common law, by making it larceny in a servant to convert\r\n     things of his master's. But quære, if they should be imitated\r\n     more than as to other breaches of trust in general. 2. As\r\n     to the subject of larceny, 4 G. 2. c. 32. 6 G. 3. c. 36. 48.\r\n     43. El. c. 7. 15.

G. 2. c. 10. have extended larceny to\r\n     things of various sorts either real, or fixed to the reality.\r\n     But the enumeration is unsystematical, and in this country,\r\n     where the produce of the earth is so spontaneous, as to have\r\n     rendered things of this kind scarcely a breach of civility or\r\n     good manners, in the eyes of the people, quære, if it would\r\n     not too much enlarge the field of Criminal law? The same may\r\n     be questioned of 9 G. 1. c. 22. 13 Car. 2. c. 10. 10 G. 2. c.\r\n     32. 5 G. 3. c. 14. 22 and 23 Car. 2. c. 25. 37 E. 3. c. 19.\r\n     making it felony to steal animals feræ naturæ.\r\n\r\n     [64] 2 G. 2. c. 25 § 3. 7 G. 3. c. 50.\r\n\r\n     [65] 3. 4.

E. 2. de fraugentibus prisonam, restrained the\r\n     judgment of life and limb for prison breaking, to cases where\r\n     the offence of the prisoner required such judgment.\r\n\r\n     It is not only vain, but wicked, in a legislator to frame\r\n     laws in opposition to the laws of nature, and to arm them\r\n     with the terrors of death. This is truly creating crimes in\r\n     order to punish them. The law of nature impels every one\r\n     to escape from confinement; it should not, therefore, be\r\n     subjected to punishment. Let the legislator restrain his\r\n     criminal by walls, not by parchment. As to strangers breaking\r\n     prison to enlarge an offender, they should, and may be fairly\r\n     considered as accessaries after the fact. This bill says\r\n     nothing of the prisoner releasing himself by breach of jail,\r\n     he will have the benefit of the first section of the bill,\r\n     which repeals the judgment of life and death at the common\r\n     law.\r\n\r\n     [68] Gif wiccan owwe wigleras nansworan, owwe morthwyrhtan\r\n     owwe fule afylede æbere horcwenan ahwhar on lande wurthan\r\n     agytene, thonne fyrsie man of earde and clænsie tha theode,\r\n     owwe on earde forfare hi mid ealle, buton hi geswican and\r\n     the deoper gebetan: if witches, or weirds, man-swearers,\r\n     or murther-wroughters, or foul, defiled, open whore-queens,\r\n     anywhere in the land were gotten, then force them off earth,\r\n     and cleanse the nation, or in earth forth-fare them withal,\r\n     buton they beseech, and deeply better.

It extended to no case where the judgment\r\n     was not of life, or limb. Note in 2. H. P. C. 326. This\r\n     therefore excluded it in trespass, petty larceny, or killing\r\n     se defendendo. In high treason against the person of the\r\n     King, it seems not to have been allowed. Note 1. H. P. C.\r\n     185. Treasons, therefore, not against the King's person\r\n     immediately, petty treasons and felonies, seem to have been\r\n     the cases where it was allowed; and even of those, not for\r\n     insidiatio varium, depopulatio agrorum, or combustio domorum.\r\n     The statute de Clero, 25. E. 3. st. 3. c. 4. settled the\r\n     law on this head. 2. As to the persons, it extended to all\r\n     clerks, always, and toties quoties. 2. H. P. C. 374. To nuns\r\n     also. Fitz. Abr.

For the purpose\r\nof easy reference, it has been classified as follows:\r\n\r\nPART I.--LETTERS WRITTEN BEFORE HIS MISSION TO EUROPE.--The letters\r\nincluded in this division, consist principally of the private\r\ncorrespondence of the Author's youth, and his official letters while\r\nGovernor of Virginia. The former are interesting mainly as illustrating\r\nhis character, his views, and his purposes in life. The latter,\r\nrelating to the period of the invasion of Virginia, and the military\r\noperations in the South, possess no inconsiderable historical value.\r\n\r\nPART II.--LETTERS WRITTEN WHILE IN EUROPE.--The letters included\r\nin this division, relate principally to the objects of his mission\r\nto Europe--his efforts to extend the commercial relations of this\r\ncountry with the European nations--the history of particular treaties\r\nof commerce--piratical depredations upon our commerce by the Barbary\r\nStates--our Foreign Debt--our relations generally with Europe--the rise\r\nand progress of the French Revolution through its early stages--his\r\nviews of the Confederation and the new Constitution--the political and\r\nsocial condition of Europe, &c., all interspersed with the reflections\r\nby the Author upon every variety of topic, literary, scientific,\r\nsocial, and political.\r\n\r\nPART III.--LETTERS WRITTEN AFTER HIS RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES TO\r\nTHE TIME OF HIS DEATH.--To the great majority of readers, this will be\r\nfound to be much the most interesting division of the work, ranging,\r\nas it does, over the whole field of Literature, Philosophy, Science,\r\nReligion, Morals, History, and Politics, and embodying the mature\r\nviews of the Author upon nearly all the great Constitutional questions\r\nwhich have arisen under our Government, and many of the most important\r\nproblems which have agitated the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nLETTERS WRITTEN BEFORE HIS MISSION TO EUROPE\r\n\r\n1773-1783.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                           FAIRFIELD, December 25, 1762.\r\n\r\nDEAR PAGE,--This very day, to others the day of greatest mirth and\r\njollity, sees me overwhelmed with more and greater misfortunes than\r\nhave befallen a descendant of Adam for these thousand years past, I\r\nam sure; and perhaps, after excepting Job, since the creation of the\r\nworld. I think his misfortunes were somewhat greater than mine; for,\r\nalthough we may be pretty nearly on a level in other respects, yet, I\r\nthank my God, I have the advantage of brother Job in this, that Satan\r\nhas not as yet put forth his hand to load me with bodily afflictions.\r\nYou must know, dear Page, that I am now in a house surrounded with\r\nenemies, who take counsel together against my soul; and when I lay\r\nme down to rest, they say among themselves, come let us destroy him.\r\nI am sure if there is such a thing as a Devil in this world, he must\r\nhave been here last night, and have had some hand in contriving what\r\nhappened to me. Do you think the cursed rats (at his instigation, I\r\nsuppose) did not eat up my pocket-book, which was in my pocket, within\r\na foot of my head? And not contented with plenty for the present, they\r\ncarried away my jemmy-worked silk garters, and half a dozen new minuets\r\nI had just got, to serve, I suppose, as provision for the winter. But\r\nof this I should not have accused the Devil, (because, you know rats\r\nwill be rats, and hunger, without the addition of his instigations,\r\nmight have urged them to do this,) if something worse, and from a\r\ndifferent quarter, had not happened. You know it rained last night, or\r\nif you do not know it, I am sure I do. When I went to bed, I laid my\r\nwatch in the usual place, and going to take her up after I arose this\r\nmorning, I found her in the same place, it's true, but _Quantum mutatus\r\nab illo_! all afloat in water, let in at a leak in the roof of the\r\nhouse, and as silent and still as the rats that had eat my pocket-book.\r\nNow, you know, if chance had had anything to do in this matter, there\r\nwere a thousand other spots where it might have chanced to leak as well\r\nas at this one, which was perpendicularly over my watch. But I'll tell\r\nyou, it's my opinion that the Devil came and bored the hole over it\r\non purpose. Well, as I was saying, my poor watch had lost her speech.\r\nI should not have cared much for this, but something worse attended\r\nit; the subtle particles of the water with which the case was filled,\r\nhad, by their penetration, so overcome the cohesion of the particles\r\nof the paper, of which my dear picture and watch-paper were composed,\r\nthat, in attempting to take them out to dry them, good God! _Mens\r\nhorret referre!_ My cursed fingers gave them such a rent, as I fear I\r\nnever shall get over. This, cried I, was the last stroke Satan had in\r\nreserve for me; he knew I cared not for anything else he could do to\r\nme, and was determined to try his last most fatal expedient. \"_Multis\r\nfortunæ vulneribus percussus, huic uni me imparem sensi, et penitus\r\nsuccubui!_\" I would have cried bitterly, but I thought it beneath the\r\ndignity of a man, and a man too, who had read των οντων, τα μεν εφ'\r\nἡμιν, τα δ' ουκ εφ' ἡμιν. However, whatever misfortunes may attend the\r\npicture or lover, my hearty prayers shall be, that all the health and\r\nhappiness which Heaven can send may be the portion of the original,\r\nand that so much goodness may ever meet with what may be most\r\nagreeable in this world, as I am sure it must be in the next. And now,\r\nalthough the picture be defaced, there is so lively an image of her\r\nimprinted in my mind, that I shall think of her too often, I fear, for\r\nmy peace of mind; and too often, I am sure, to get through old Coke\r\nthis winter; for God knows I have not seen him since I packed him up\r\nin my trunk in Williamsburg. Well, Page, I do wish the Devil had old\r\nCoke, for I am sure I never was so tired of an old dull scoundrel in\r\nmy life. What! are there so few inquietudes tacked to this momentary\r\nlife of ours, that we must need be loading ourselves with a thousand\r\nmore? Or, as brother Job says, (who, by-the-bye, I think began to\r\nwhine a little under his afflictions,) \"Are not my days few? Cease\r\nthen, that I may take comfort a little before I go whence I shall not\r\nreturn, even to the land of darkness, and the shadow of death.\" But\r\nthe old fellows say we must read to gain knowledge, and gain knowledge\r\nto make us happy and admired. _Mere jargon!_ Is there any such thing\r\nas happiness in this world? No. And as for admiration, I am sure the\r\nman who powders most, perfumes most, embroiders most, and talks most\r\nnonsense, is most admired. Though to be candid, there are some who\r\nhave too much good sense to esteem such monkey-like animals as these,\r\nin whose formation, as the saying is, the tailors and barbers go\r\nhalves with God Almighty; and since these are the only persons whose\r\nesteem is worth a wish, I do not know but that, upon the whole, the\r\nadvice of these old fellows may be worth following.\r\n\r\nYou cannot conceive the satisfaction it would give me to have a letter\r\nfrom you. Write me very circumstantially everything which happened at\r\nthe wedding. Was she there? because, if she was, I ought to have been\r\nat the Devil for not being there too. If there is any news stirring\r\nin town or country, such as deaths, courtships, or marriages, in the\r\ncircle of my acquaintance, let me know it. Remember me affectionately\r\nto all the young ladies of my acquaintance, particularly the Miss\r\nBurwells, and Miss Potters, and tell them that though that heavy\r\nearthly part of me, my body, be absent, the better half of me, my soul,\r\nis ever with them, and that my best wishes shall ever attend them.\r\nTell Miss Alice Corbin that I verily believe the rats knew I was to\r\nwin a pair of garters from her, or they never would have been so cruel\r\nas to carry mine away. This very consideration makes me so sure of\r\nthe bet, that I shall ask everybody I see from that part of the world\r\nwhat pretty gentleman is making his addresses to her. I would fain ask\r\nthe favor of Miss Becca Burwell to give me another watch-paper of her\r\nown cutting, which I should esteem much more, though it were a plain\r\nround one, than the nicest in the world cut by other hands; however,\r\nI am afraid she would think this presumption, after my suffering the\r\nother to get spoiled. If you think you can excuse me to her for this,\r\nI should be glad if you would ask her. Tell Miss Sukey Potter that\r\nI heard, just before I came out of town, that she was offended with\r\nme about something, what it is I do not know; but this I know, that\r\nI never was guilty of the least disrespect to her in my life, either\r\nin word or deed; as far from it as it has been possible for one to\r\nbe. I suppose when we meet next, she will be _endeavoring_ to repay\r\nan imaginary affront with a real one; but she may save herself the\r\ntrouble, for nothing that she can say or do to me shall ever lessen her\r\nin my esteem, and I am determined always to look upon her as the same\r\nhonest-hearted, good-humored, agreeable lady I ever did. Tell--tell--in\r\nshort, tell them all ten thousand things more than either you or I can\r\nnow or ever shall think of as long as we live.\r\n\r\nMy mind has been so taken up with thinking of my acquaintances, that,\r\ntill this moment, I almost imagined myself in Williamsburg, talking to\r\nyou in our old unreserved way; and never observed, till I turned over\r\nthe leaf, to what an immoderate size I had swelled my letter; however,\r\nthat I may not tire your patience by further additions, I will make but\r\nthis one more, that I am sincerely and affectionately,\r\n\r\n                  Dear Page, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I am now within an easy day's ride of Shadwell, whither I shall\r\nproceed in two or three days.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                                SHADWELL, Jan. 20, 1763.\r\n\r\nDEAR PAGE,--To tell you the plain truth, I have not a syllable to write\r\nto you about. For I do not conceive that anything can happen in my\r\nworld which you would give a curse to know, or I either. All things\r\nhere appear to me to trudge on in one and the same round: we rise\r\nin the morning that we may eat breakfast, dinner and supper, and go\r\nto bed again that we may get up the next morning and do the same: so\r\nthat you never saw two peas more alike than our yesterday and to-day.\r\nUnder these circumstances, what would you have me say? Would you that\r\nI should write nothing but truth? I tell you I know nothing that is\r\ntrue. Or would you rather that I should write you a pack of lies? Why,\r\nunless they were more ingenious than I am able to invent, they would\r\nfurnish you with little amusement. What can I do then? nothing, but\r\nask you the news in your world. How have you done since I saw you? How\r\ndid Nancy look at you when you danced with her at Southall's? Have you\r\nany glimmering of hope? How does R. B. do? Had I better stay here and\r\ndo nothing, or go down and do less? or, in other words, had I better\r\nstay here while I am here, or go down that I may have the pleasure of\r\nsailing up the river again in a full-rigged flat? Inclination tells me\r\nto go, receive my sentence, and be no longer in suspense; but reason\r\nsays, if you go, and your attempt proves unsuccessful, you will be\r\nten times more wretched than ever. In my last to you, dated Fairfield,\r\nDec. 25, I wrote to you of the losses I had sustained; in the present\r\nI may mention one more, which is the loss of the whites of my eyes, in\r\nthe room of which I have got reds, which gives me such exquisite pain\r\nthat I have not attempted to read anything since a few days after Jack\r\nWalker went down, and God knows when I shall be able to do it. I have\r\nsome thoughts of going to Petersburg, if the actors go there in May.\r\nIf I do, I do not know but I may keep on to Williamsburg, as the birth\r\nnight will be near. I hear that Ben Harrison has been to Wilton: let\r\nme know his success. Have you an inclination to travel, Page? because\r\nif you have, I shall be glad of your company. For you must know that\r\nas soon as the Rebecca (the name I intend to give the vessel above\r\nmentioned) is completely finished, I intend to hoist sail and away.\r\nI shall visit particularly England, Holland, France, Spain, Italy,\r\n(where I would buy me a good fiddle,) and Egypt, and return through the\r\nBritish provinces to the Northward home. This to be sure, would take us\r\ntwo or three years, and if we should not both be cured of love in that\r\ntime, I think the devil would be in it. After desiring you to remember\r\nme to acquaintances below, male and female, I subscribe myself,\r\n\r\n                  Dear Page, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                              SHADWELL, July 15th, 1763.\r\n\r\nDEAR PAGE,--Yours of May 30th came safe to hand. The rival you\r\nmentioned I know not whether to think formidable or not, as there has\r\nbeen so great an opening for him during my absence. I say _has been_,\r\nbecause I expect there is one no longer. Since you have undertaken to\r\nact as my attorney, you advise me to go immediately and lay siege _in\r\nform_. You certainly did not think, at the time you wrote this, of that\r\nparagraph in my letter wherein I mentioned to you my resolution of\r\ngoing to Britain. And to begin an affair of that kind now, and carry\r\nit on so long a time in form, is by no means a proper plan. No, no,\r\nPage; whatever assurances I may give her in private of my esteem for\r\nher, or whatever assurances I may ask in return from her, depend on\r\nit--they must be kept in private. Necessity will oblige me to proceed\r\nin a method which is not generally thought fair; that of treating\r\nwith a ward before obtaining the approbation of her guardian. I say\r\nnecessity will oblige me to it, because I never can bear to remain\r\nin suspense so long a time. If I am to succeed, the sooner I know it,\r\nthe less uneasiness I shall have to go through. If I am to meet with\r\na disappointment, the sooner I know it, the more of life I shall have\r\nto wear it off; and if I do meet with one, I hope in God, and verily\r\nbelieve, it will be the last. I assure you, that I almost envy you\r\nyour present freedom; and if Belinda will not accept of my service, it\r\nshall never be offered to another. That she may, I pray most sincerely;\r\nbut that she will, she never gave me reason to hope. With regard to my\r\nnot proceeding in form, I do not know how she may like it. I am afraid\r\nnot much. That her guardians would not, if they should know of it, is\r\nvery certain. But I should think that if they were consulted after I\r\nreturn, it would be sufficient. The greatest inconvenience would be my\r\nnot having the liberty of visiting so freely. This is a subject worth\r\nyour talking over with her; and I wish you would, and would transmit to\r\nme your whole confab at length. I should be scared to death at making\r\nher so unreasonable a proposal as that of waiting until I return from\r\nBritain, unless she could first be prepared for it. I am afraid it will\r\nmake my chance of succeeding considerably worse. But the event at last\r\nmust be this, that if she consents, I shall be happy; if she does not,\r\nI must _endeavor_ to be as much so as possible. I have thought a good\r\ndeal on your case, and as mine may perhaps be similar, I must endeavor\r\nto look on it in the same light in which I have often advised you to\r\nlook on yours. Perfect happiness, I believe, was never intended by the\r\nDeity to be the lot of one of his creatures in this world; but that he\r\nhas very much put in our power the nearness of our approaches to it, is\r\nwhat I have steadfastly believed.\r\n\r\nThe most fortunate of us, in our journey through life, frequently\r\nmeet with calamities and misfortunes which may greatly afflict us;\r\nand, to fortify our minds against the attacks of these calamities and\r\nmisfortunes, should be one of the principal studies and endeavors\r\nof our lives. The only method of doing this is to assume a perfect\r\nresignation to the Divine will, to consider that whatever does happen,\r\nmust happen; and that, by our uneasiness, we cannot prevent the blow\r\nbefore it does fall, but we may add to its force after it has fallen.\r\nThese considerations, and others such as these, may enable us in some\r\nmeasure to surmount the difficulties thrown in our way; to bear up\r\nwith a tolerable degree of patience under this burthen of life; and to\r\nproceed with a pious and unshaken resignation, till we arrive at our\r\njourney's end, when we may deliver up our trust into the hands of him\r\nwho gave it, and receive such reward as to him shall seem proportioned\r\nto our merit. Such, dear Page, will be the language of the man who\r\nconsiders his situation in this life, and such should be the language\r\nof every man who would wish to render that situation as easy as the\r\nnature of it will admit. Few things will disturb him at all: nothing\r\nwill disturb him much.\r\n\r\nIf this letter was to fall into the hands of some of our gay\r\nacquaintance, your correspondent and his solemn notions would probably\r\nbe the subjects of a great deal of mirth and raillery, but to you, I\r\nthink, I can venture to send it. It is in effect a continuation of the\r\nmany conversations we have had on subjects of this kind; and I heartily\r\nwish we could now continue these conversations face to face. The time\r\nwill not be very long now before we may do it, as I expect to be in\r\nWilliamsburg by the first of October, if not sooner. I do not know\r\nthat I shall have occasion to return, if I can rent rooms in town to\r\nlodge in; and to prevent the inconvenience of moving my lodgings for\r\nthe future, I think to build: no castle though, I assure you; only a\r\nsmall house, which shall contain a room for myself and another for you,\r\nand no more, unless Belinda should think proper to favor us with her\r\ncompany, in which case I will enlarge the plan as much as she pleases.\r\nMake my compliments to her particularly, as also to Sukey Potter, Judy\r\nBurwell, and such others of my acquaintance as enquire after me. I am,\r\n\r\n                    Dear Page, your sincere friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                          WILLIAMSBURG, October 7, 1763.\r\n\r\nDEAR PAGE,--In the most melancholy fit that ever any poor soul was, I\r\nsit down to write to you. Last night, as merry as agreeable company\r\nand dancing with Belinda in the Apollo could make me, I never could\r\nhave thought the succeeding sun would have seen me so wretched as I\r\nnow am! I was prepared to say a great deal: I had dressed up, in my\r\nown mind, such thoughts as occurred to me, in as moving a language as\r\nI knew how, and expected to have performed in a tolerably creditable\r\nmanner. But, good God! When I had an opportunity of venting them, a\r\nfew broken sentences, uttered in great disorder, and interrupted with\r\npauses of uncommon length, were the too visible marks of my strange\r\nconfusion! The whole confab I will tell you, word for word, if I can,\r\nwhen I see you, which God send may be soon. Affairs at W. and M. are\r\nin the greatest confusion. Walker, M'Clurg and Wat Jones are expelled\r\n_pro tempore_, or, as Horrox softens it, rusticated for a month.\r\nLewis Burwell, Warner Lewis, and one Thompson, have fled to escape\r\nflagellation. I should have excepted Warner Lewis, who came off of\r\nhis own accord. Jack Walker leaves town on Monday. The court is now at\r\nhand, which I must attend constantly, so that unless you come to town,\r\nthere is little probability of my meeting with you anywhere else. For\r\nGod sake come. I am, dear Page, your sincere friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                           DEVILSBURG, January 19, 1764.\r\n\r\nThe contents of your letter have not a little alarmed me; and really,\r\nupon seriously weighing them with what has formerly passed between ----\r\nand myself, I am somewhat at a loss what to conclude; your \"_semper\r\nsaltat, semper ridet, semper loquitur, semper solicitat_,\" &c., appear\r\na little suspicious, but good God! it is impossible! I told you our\r\nconfab in the Apollo; but I believe I never told you that we had on\r\nanother occasion. I then opened my mind more freely, and more fully.\r\nI mentioned the necessity of my going to England, and the delays\r\nwhich would consequently be occasioned by that. I said in what manner\r\nI should conduct myself till then, and explained my reasons, which\r\nappears to give that satisfaction I could have wished; in short, I\r\nmanaged in such a manner that I was tolerable easy myself, without\r\ndoing anything which could give αδνιλεβ'ς friends the least\r\numbrage, were the whole that passed to be related to them. I asked\r\nno question which would admit of a categorical answer; but I assured\r\nαδνιλεβ that such questions would one day be asked--in short,\r\nwere I to have another interview with him, I could say nothing now\r\nwhich I did not say then; and were I, with a view of obtaining one,\r\n_licentiam solicitandi aliis, quibus degit postulare_, it would be\r\npreviously necessary to go the rounds _cum custodibus_; and after\r\nall this, he could be in no other situation than he is at present.\r\nAfter the proofs I have given of my sincerity, he can be under no\r\napprehension of a change in my sentiments; and were I to do as my\r\nfriends advise me, I would give no better security than he has at\r\npresent. He is satisfied that I shall make him an offer, and if he\r\nintends to accept of it, he will disregard those made by others; my\r\nfate depends on αδνιλεβ'ς present resolutions, by them I must\r\nstand or fall--if they are not favorable to me, it is out of my power\r\nto say anything to make them so which I have not said already; so that\r\na visit could not possibly be of the least weight, and it is, I am\r\nsure, what he does not in the least expect. I hear you are courting\r\nF----y B----l, but shall not listen to it till I hear it from you. When\r\nI was up the country, I wrote a letter to you, dated Fairfield, Dec.\r\n25, 1763; let me know if you have received such a one. As I suppose you\r\ndo not use your Statutes of Britain, if you can lend them to me, till\r\nI can provide myself with a copy, it will infinitely oblige me. Adieu,\r\ndear Page.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                       DEVILSBURG,[78] January 23, 1764.\r\n\r\nDEAR PAGE,--I received your letter of Wednesday, the 18th instant;\r\nin that, of this day, you mention one which you wrote last Friday,\r\nand sent by the Secretary's boy; but I have neither seen nor heard of\r\nsuch a one. God send mine of January 19 to you may not have shared\r\nthe same fate; for, by your letter, I am uncertain whether you have\r\nreceived it or not; you therein say, \"you hope to have received an\r\nanswer from me by this time,\" by which I judge it has miscarried; but\r\nyou mention mine of December 25th, which put me in spirits again, as\r\nI do not know how you should have got intelligence that I had wrote\r\nsuch a one, unless you had seen my letter of Jan. 19, in which it was\r\nmentioned--yes, there is one other way by which you might have received\r\nsuch intelligence. My letter of Jan. 19 may have been opened, and the\r\nperson who did it may have been further incited by curiosity, to ask\r\nyou if you had received such a letter as they saw mentioned therein;\r\nbut God send, and I hope this is not the case. Sukey Potter, to whom\r\nI sent it, told me yesterday she delivered it to Mr. T. Nelson, the\r\nyounger, who had delivered it to you--I hope with his own hand. I wish\r\nI had followed your example, and wrote it in Latin, and that I had\r\ncalled my dear _campana in die_,[79] instead of αδνιλεβ.\r\n\r\nWe must fall on some scheme of communicating our thoughts to each\r\nother, which shall be totally unintelligible to every one but to\r\nourselves. I will send you some of these days Shelton's Tachygraphical\r\nAlphabet, and directions. Jack Walker is engaged to Betsey Moore, and\r\ndesired all his brethren might be made acquainted with his happiness.\r\nBut I hear he will not be married this year or two. Put _campana in\r\ndie_ in mind of me; tell him I think as I always did. I have sent my\r\nhorses up the country, so that it is out of my power to take even an\r\nairing on horseback at any time. My paper holds out no longer, so must\r\nbid you adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                              DEVILSBURG, April 9, 1764.\r\n\r\nDEAR PAGE,--This letter will be conveyed to you by the assistance\r\nof our friend Warner Lewis. Poor fellow! never did I see one more\r\nsincerely captivated in my life. He walked to the Indian camp with her\r\nyesterday, by which means he had an opportunity of giving her two or\r\nthree love squeezes by the hand; and, like a true arcadian swain, has\r\nbeen so enraptured ever since, that he is company for no one. B----y\r\nhas at last bestowed her hand on B----d; and whether it was for money,\r\nbeauty, or principle, will be so nice a dispute, that no one will\r\nventure to pronounce. Two days before the wedding I was not a little\r\nsurprised, on going to the door at my house, to see him alight from\r\nhis horse. He stepped up to me, and desired the favor of me to come to\r\nMr. Yates' at such a time. It was so unexpected, that for some time I\r\ncould make no reply; at last, I said \"yes,\" and turned about and walked\r\nback into my room. I accordingly attended, and to crown the joke, when\r\nI got there, was dubbed a bridesman. There were many other curious\r\ncircumstances too tedious to mention here. Jack Walker is expected in\r\ntown to-morrow. How does your pulse beat after your trip to the Isle of\r\nWight? What a high figure I should have cut, had I gone! When I heard\r\nwho visited you there, I thought I had met with the narrowest escape in\r\nthe world. I wonder how I should have behaved--I am sure I should have\r\nbeen at a great loss. If your mistress can spare you a little time,\r\nyour friends here would be very glad to see you, particularly Small and\r\nmyself, as everything is now ready for taking the height of this place\r\nabove the water of the creeks. Fleming's relapse will justly afford you\r\ngreat matter of triumph, after rallying you so much on being in love.\r\n\r\n                           Adieu, dear Page.\r\n\r\nP. S. Walker is just arrived--he goes out of town on Wednesday, and\r\nwill return again in about three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                         CHARLOTTESVILLE, Feb. 21, 1770.\r\n\r\nDEAR PAGE,--I am to acquaint Mrs. Page of the loss of my favorite\r\npullet; the consequence of which will readily occur to her. I promised\r\nalso to give her some Virginia silk which I had expected, and I begin\r\nto wish my expectation may not prove vain. I fear she will think me\r\nbut an ungainly acquaintance. My late loss may perhaps have reached\r\nyou by this time; I mean the loss of my mother's house by fire, and\r\nin it of every paper I had in the world, and almost every book. On\r\na reasonable estimate I calculate the _cost_ of the books burned to\r\nhave been £200 sterling. Would to God it had been the money, _then_\r\nhad it never cost me a sigh! To make the loss more sensible, it fell\r\nprincipally on my books of Common Law, of which I have but one left, at\r\nthat time lent out. Of papers too of every kind I am utterly destitute.\r\nAll of these, whether public or private, of business or of amusement,\r\nhave perished in the flames. I had made some progress in preparing for\r\nthe succeeding General Court; and having, as was my custom, thrown my\r\nthoughts into the form of notes, I troubled my head no more with them.\r\nThese are gone, and like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not\r\na trace behind. The records also, and other papers which furnished me\r\nwith states of the several cases, having shared the same fate, I have\r\nno foundation whereon to set out anew. I have in vain attempted to\r\nrecollect some of them; the defect sometimes of one, sometimes of more\r\ncircumstances, rendering them so imperfect that I can make nothing of\r\nthem. What am I to do then in April? The resolution which the Court\r\nhas declared of admitting no continuances of causes seemed to be\r\nunalterable; yet it might surely be urged, that my case is too singular\r\nto admit of their being often troubled with the like excuse. Should\r\nit be asked, what are the misfortunes of an individual to a Court?\r\nThe answer of a Court, as well as of an individual, if left to me,\r\nshould be in the words of Terence, \"_homo sum; humani nil a me alienum\r\nputo_\"--but a truce with this disagreeable subject.\r\n\r\nAm I never more to have a letter from you? Why the devil don't you\r\nwrite? But I suppose you are always in the moon, or some of the\r\nplanetary regions. I mean you are there in idea; and, unless you mend,\r\nyou shall have my consent to be there _de facto_; at least, during the\r\nvacations of the Court and Assembly. If your spirit is too elevated to\r\nadvert to sublunary subjects, depute my friend Mrs. Page to support\r\nyour correspondences. Methinks I should, with wonderful pleasure,\r\nopen and peruse a letter written by so fair, and (what is better)\r\nso friendly hands. If thinking much of you would entitle me to the\r\ncivility of a letter, I assure you I merit a very long one. If this\r\nconflagration, by which I am burned out of a home, had come before I\r\nhad advanced so far in preparing another, I do not know but I might\r\nhave cherished some treasonable thoughts of leaving these my native\r\nhills; indeed I should be much happier were I nearer to Rosewell and\r\nSevern hills--however, the gods, I fancy, were apprehensive that if we\r\nwere placed together, we should pull down the moon, or play some such\r\ndevilish prank with their works. I reflect often with pleasure on the\r\nphilosophical evenings I passed at Rosewell in my last visits there.\r\nI was always fond of philosophy, even in its drier forms; but from a\r\nruby lip, it comes with charms irresistible. Such a feast of sentiment\r\nmust exhilarate and lengthen life, at least as much as the feast of\r\nthe sensualist shortens it--in a word, I prize it so highly, that, if\r\nyou will at any time collect the same _Belle Assemblée_, on giving me\r\nthree days previous notice, I shall certainly repair to my place as\r\na member of it. Should it not happen before I come down, I will carry\r\nSally Nicholas in the green chair to Newquarter, where your periagua\r\n(how the ---- should I spell that word?) will meet us, automaton-like,\r\nof its own accord. You know I had a wagon which moved itself--cannot\r\nwe construct a boat then which shall row itself? _Amicus noster,\r\nFons_,[80] _quo modo agit, et quid agit?_ You may be all dead for\r\nanything we can tell here. I expect he will follow the good old rule of\r\ndriving one passion out by letting another in. _Clavum clavo pangere_\r\nwas your advice to me on a similar occasion. I hope you will watch his\r\nimmersion as narrowly as if he were one of Jupiter's satellites; and\r\ngive me immediate notice, that I may prepare a dish of advice. I do not\r\nmean, Madam, to advise him against it. On the contrary, I am become an\r\nadvocate for the passion; for I too am _cœlo tactus, Currus_[81]\r\n_bene se habet_. He speaks, thinks, and dreams of nothing but his\r\nyoung son. This friend of ours, Page, in a very small house, with a\r\ntable, half a dozen chairs, and one or two servants, is the happiest\r\nman in the universe. Every incident in life he so takes as to render\r\nit a source of pleasure. With as much benevolence as the heart of man\r\nwill hold, but with an utter neglect of the costly apparatus of life,\r\nhe exhibits to the world a new phenomenon in philosophy--the Samian\r\nsage in the tub of the cynic. Name me sometimes _homunculo tuo_, not\r\nforgetting little _dic mendacium_. I am determined not to enter on the\r\nnext page, lest I should extend this nonsense to the bottom of that\r\nalso. _A dieu je vous commis_, not doubting his care of you both.\r\n\r\n                                                          TH: JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHAS. McPHERSON.\r\n\r\n                               ALBERMARLE, IN VIRGINIA, Feb. 25th, 1773.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Encouraged by the small acquaintance which I had the\r\npleasure of having contracted with you during your residence in this\r\ncountry, I take the liberty of making the present application to you.\r\nI understood you were related to the gentleman of your name (Mr. James\r\nMcPherson), to whom the world is so much indebted for the elegant\r\ncollection, arrangement, and translation of Ossian's poems. These\r\npieces have been and will, I think, during my life, continue to be\r\nto me the sources of daily and exalted pleasures. The tender and the\r\nsublime emotions of the mind were never before so wrought up by the\r\nhuman hand. I am not ashamed to own that I think this rude bard of the\r\nNorth the greatest poet that has ever existed. Merely for the pleasure\r\nof reading his works, I am become desirous of learning the language\r\nin which he sung, and of possessing his songs in their original form.\r\nMr. McPherson, I think, informs us he is possessed of the originals.\r\nIndeed, a gentleman has lately told me he had seen them in print; but\r\nI am afraid he has mistaken a specimen from Temora, annexed to some\r\nof the editions of the translation, for the whole works. If they are\r\nprinted, it will abridge my request and your trouble, to the sending\r\nme a printed copy; but if there be more such, my petition is, that\r\nyou would be so good as to use your interest with Mr. McPherson to\r\nobtain leave to take a manuscript copy of them, and procure it to be\r\ndone. I would choose it in a fair, round hand, on fine paper, with a\r\ngood margin, bound in parchments as elegantly as possible, lettered on\r\nthe back, and marbled or gilt on the edges of the leaves. I would not\r\nregard expense in doing this. I would further beg the favor of you to\r\ngive me a catalogue of the books written in that language, and to send\r\nme such of them as may be necessary for learning it. These will, of\r\ncourse, include a grammar and dictionary. The cost of these, as well\r\nas the copy of Ossian, will be (for me), on demand, answered by Mr.\r\nAlexander McCaul, sometime of Virginia, merchant, but now of Glasgow,\r\nor by your friend Mr. Ninian Minzees, of Richmond, in Virginia, to\r\nwhose care the books may be sent. You can, perhaps, tell me whether\r\nwe may ever hope to see any more of those Celtic pieces published.\r\nManuscript copies of any which are in print, it would at any time give\r\nme the greatest happiness to receive. The glow of one warm thought is\r\nto me worth more than money. I hear with pleasure from your friend that\r\nyour path through life is likely to be smoothed by success. I wish the\r\nbusiness and the pleasures of your situation would admit leisure now\r\nand then to scribble a line to one who wishes you every felicity, and\r\nwould willingly merit the appellation of, dear sir,\r\n\r\n                    Your friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COL. A. CARY.\r\n\r\n                                                         Dec. 9th, 1774.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As I mean to be a conscientious observer of the measures\r\ngenerally thought requisite for the preservation of our independent\r\nrights, so I think myself bound to account to my country for any act of\r\nmine which might wear an appearance of contravening them. I, therefore,\r\ntake the liberty of stating to you the following matter, that through\r\nyour friendly intervention, it may be communicated to the committee of\r\nyour county. You may remember that it was about the last of May that\r\nthe House of Burgesses, after its dissolution, met in Raleigh, and\r\nformed our first association against the future use of tea only; tho'\r\nthe proceedings of the ministry against the town of Boston were then\r\nwell known to us.\r\n\r\nI believe nobody thought at that time of extending our association\r\nfurther, to the total interruption of our commerce with Britain; or, if\r\nit was proposed by any (which I don't recollect), it was condemned by\r\nthe general sense of the members who formed that association. Two or\r\nthree days, therefore, after this, I wrote to Cary & Co., of London,\r\nfor fourteen pairs of sash windows, to be sent to me ready made and\r\nglazed, with a small parcel of spare glass to mend with. This letter\r\nwent by a ship, which sailed about the third of June, just before Power\r\narrived here. I did not suppose they would send them till Power should\r\ncome in again in the spring of 1775.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of June, as nearly as I can recollect, a few of the\r\nlate members were again convened (in consequence of fresh advices from\r\nBoston), and then it was suggested that a more extensive association\r\nmight be necessary. A convention met for that purpose the first of\r\nAugust, and formed a new association, of which I received a copy about\r\nthe 11th of the month. But as a general Congress was then appointed\r\nto be held to reconsider the same matters, and it was agreed that\r\nour association should be subject to any alteration that they might\r\nrecommend, I did not write to countermand my order, thinking I should\r\nhave sufficient time after the final determination of the Congress\r\nshould be known, to countermand it before Power should sail in the\r\nspring. Accordingly, within a few days after receiving a copy of the\r\ngeneral association, I wrote to Cary & Co. not to send the sashes\r\nand glass which I had ordered, and gave my letter to the care of a\r\ngentleman (Mr. Evans) just then going downward, who promised to send\r\nit out speedily; but three or four days after I received a letter\r\nfrom those gentlemen, dated August 29th, in which they inform me my\r\nwindow frames and glass are ready, but that it being necessary to\r\ndetain them about a month to harden the puttying, they were not sent\r\nin that ship, but might be expected by the next ship afterwards. From\r\nthis I conclude they may be near arriving at this time, in which case\r\nthey will come under the 1st and 10th articles of the association. In\r\norder, therefore, that no proceeding of mine might give a handle for\r\ntraducing our measures, I thought it better previously to lay before\r\nyour committee, within whose ward they will probably be landed, a full\r\nstate of the matter, by which it might be seen under what expectations\r\nI had failed to give an earlier countermand, and to show that, as they\r\ncome under the prohibitions of the Continental association, (which,\r\nwithout the spirit of prophecy, could not have been foretold when I\r\nordered them,) so I mean they shall be subject to its condemnation. To\r\nyour committee, therefore, if landed within their county, I submit the\r\ndisposal of them, which shall be obeyed as soon as made known to their\r\nand your\r\n\r\n                          Most humble servant.\r\n\r\nDec. 9th, 1774. A copy of this sent to Col. A. Cary, and another to\r\nCol. B. Harrison, by Mr. Marrei.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. WILLIAM SMALL.\r\n\r\n                                                            May 7, 1775.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Within this week we have received the unhappy news of an\r\naction of considerable magnitude, between the King's troops and our\r\nbrethren of Boston, in which it is said five hundred of the former,\r\nwith the Earl of Percy, are slain. That such an action has occurred,\r\nis undoubted, though perhaps the circumstances may not have reached us\r\nwith truth. This accident has cut off our last hope of reconciliation,\r\nand a phrensy of revenge seems to have seized all ranks of people.\r\nIt is a lamentable circumstance, that the only mediatory power,\r\nacknowledged by both parties, instead of leading to a reconciliation\r\nhis divided people, should pursue the incendiary purpose of still\r\nblowing up the flames, as we find him constantly doing, in every speech\r\nand public declaration. This may, perhaps, be intended to intimidate\r\ninto acquiescence, but the effect has been most unfortunately\r\notherwise. A little knowledge of human nature, and attention to its\r\nordinary workings, might have foreseen that the spirits of the people\r\nhere were in a state, in which they were more likely to be provoked,\r\nthan frightened, by haughty deportment. And to fill up the measure of\r\nirritation, a proscription of individuals has been substituted in the\r\nroom of just trial. Can it be believed, that a grateful people will\r\nsuffer those to be consigned to execution, whose sole crime has been\r\nthe developing and asserting their rights? Had the Parliament possessed\r\nthe power of reflection, they would have avoided a measure as impotent,\r\nas it was inflammatory. When I saw Lord Chatham's bill, I entertained\r\nhigh hope that a reconciliation could have been brought about. The\r\ndifference between his terms, and those offered by our Congress,\r\nmight have been accommodated, if entered on, by both parties, with a\r\ndisposition to accommodate. But the dignity of Parliament, it seems,\r\ncan brook no opposition to its power. Strange, that a set of men, who\r\nhave made sale of their virtue to the Minister, should yet talk of\r\nretaining dignity! But I am getting into politics, though I sat down\r\nonly to ask your acceptance of the wine, and express my constant wishes\r\nfor your happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN RANDOLPH, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMONTICELLO, August 25, 1775.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am sorry the situation of our country should render it not\r\neligible to you to remain longer in it. I hope the returning wisdom of\r\nGreat Britain will, ere long, put an end to this unnatural contest.\r\nThere may be people to whose tempers and dispositions contention is\r\npleasing, and who, therefore, wish a continuance of confusion, but\r\nto me it is of all states but one, the most horrid. My first wish is\r\na restoration of our just rights; my second, a return of the happy\r\nperiod, when, consistently with duty, I may withdraw myself totally\r\nfrom the public stage, and pass the rest of my days in domestic ease\r\nand tranquillity, banishing every desire of ever hearing what passes\r\nin the world. Perhaps (for the latter adds considerably to the warmth\r\nof the former wish), looking with fondness towards a reconciliation\r\nwith Great Britain, I cannot help hoping you may be able to contribute\r\ntowards expediting this good work. I think it must be evident to\r\nyourself, that the Ministry have been deceived by their officers on\r\nthis side of the water, who (for what purpose I cannot tell) have\r\nconstantly represented the American opposition as that of a small\r\nfaction, in which the body of the people took little part. This, you\r\ncan inform them, of your own knowledge, is untrue. They have taken\r\nit into their heads, too, that we are cowards, and shall surrender\r\nat discretion to an armed force. The past and future operations of\r\nthe war must confirm or undeceive them on that head. I wish they were\r\nthoroughly and minutely acquainted with every circumstance relative\r\nto America, as it exists in truth. I am persuaded, this would go far\r\ntowards disposing them to reconciliation. Even those in Parliament\r\nwho are called friends to America, seem to know nothing of our real\r\ndeterminations. I observe, they pronounced in the last Parliament, that\r\nthe Congress of 1774 did not mean to insist rigorously on the terms\r\nthey held out, but kept something in reserve, to give up; and, in fact,\r\nthat they would give up everything but the article of taxation. Now,\r\nthe truth is far from this, as I can affirm, and put my honor to the\r\nassertion. Their continuance in this error may, perhaps, produce very\r\nill consequences. The Congress stated the lowest terms they thought\r\npossible to be accepted, in order to convince the world they were not\r\nunreasonable. They gave up the monopoly and regulation of trade, and\r\nall acts of Parliament prior to 1764, leaving to British generosity\r\nto render these, at some future time, as easy to America as the\r\ninterest of Britain would admit. But this was before blood was spilt.\r\nI cannot affirm, but have reason to think, these terms would not now\r\nbe accepted. I wish no false sense of honor, no ignorance of our real\r\nintentions, no vain hope that partial concessions of right will be\r\naccepted, may induce the Ministry to trifle with accommodation, till\r\nit shall be out of their power ever to accommodate. If, indeed, Great\r\nBritain, disjoined from her colonies, be a match for the most potent\r\nnations of Europe, with the colonies thrown into their scale, they\r\nmay go on securely. But if they are not assured of this, it would be\r\ncertainly unwise, by trying the event of another campaign, to risk our\r\naccepting a foreign aid, which, perhaps, may not be obtainable, but\r\non condition of everlasting avulsion from Great Britain. This would\r\nbe thought a hard condition, to those who still wish for re-union with\r\ntheir parent country. I am sincerely one of those, and would rather be\r\nin dependence on Great Britain, properly limited, than on any nation\r\non earth, or than on no nation. But I am one of those, too, who, rather\r\nthan submit to the rights of legislating for us, assumed by the British\r\nParliament, and which late experience has shown they will so cruelly\r\nexercise, would lend my hand to sink the whole Island in the ocean.\r\n\r\nIf undeceiving the Minister, as to matters of fact, may change his\r\ndisposition, it will, perhaps, be in your power, by assisting to do\r\nthis, to render service to the whole empire, at the most critical time,\r\ncertainly, that it has ever seen. Whether Britain shall continue the\r\nhead of the greatest empire on earth, or shall return to her original\r\nstation in the political scale of Europe, depends, perhaps, on the\r\nresolutions of the succeeding winter. God send they may be wise and\r\nsalutary for us all. I shall be glad to hear from you as often as\r\nyou may be disposed to think of things here. You may be at liberty, I\r\nexpect, to communicate some things, consistently with your honor, and\r\nthe duties you will owe to a protecting nation. Such a communication\r\namong individuals, may be mutually beneficial to the contending\r\nparties. On this or any future occasion, if I affirm to you any facts,\r\nyour knowledge of me will enable you to decide on their credibility;\r\nif I hazard opinions on the dispositions of men or other speculative\r\npoints, you can only know they are my opinions. My best wishes for your\r\nfelicity, attend you, wherever you go, and believe me to be assuredly,\r\n\r\n                        Your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN RANDOLPH, ESQ,.\r\n\r\n                                        PHILADELPHIA, November 29, 1775.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am to give you the melancholy intelligence of the death\r\nof our most worthy Speaker, which happened here on the 22d of the last\r\nmonth. He was struck with an apoplexy, and expired within five hours.\r\n\r\nI have it in my power to acquaint you, that the success of our arms has\r\ncorresponded with the justice of our cause. Chambly and St. John's were\r\ntaken some weeks ago, and in them the whole regular army in Canada,\r\nexcept about forty or fifty men. This day, certain intelligence has\r\nreached us, that our General, Montgomery, is received into Montreal;\r\nand we expect, every hour, to be informed that Quebec has opened its\r\narms to Colonel Arnold, who, with eleven hundred men, was sent from\r\nBoston up the Kennebec, and down the Chaudière river to that place. He\r\nexpected to be there early this month. Montreal acceded to us on the\r\n13th, and Carlton set out, with the shattered remains of his little\r\narmy, for Quebec, where we hope he will be taken up by Arnold. In\r\na short time, we have reason to hope, the delegates of Canada will\r\njoin us in Congress, and complete the American union, as far as we\r\nwish to have it completed. We hear that one of the British transports\r\nhas arrived at Boston; the rest are beating off the coast, in very\r\nbad weather. You will have heard, before this reaches you, that Lord\r\nDunmore has commenced hostilities in Virginia. That people bore with\r\neverything, till he attempted to burn the town of Hampton. They opposed\r\nand repelled him, with considerable loss on his side, and none on ours.\r\nIt has raised our countrymen into a perfect phrensy. It is an immense\r\nmisfortune, to the whole empire, to have a King of such a disposition\r\nat such a time. We are told, and everything proves it true, that he is\r\nthe bitterest enemy we have. His Minister is able, and that satisfies\r\nme that ignorance or wickedness, somewhere, controls him. In an earlier\r\npart of this contest, our petitions told him, that from our King there\r\nwas but one appeal. The admonition was despised, and that appeal forced\r\non us. To undo his empire, he has but one truth more to learn; that,\r\nafter colonies have drawn the sword, there is but one step more they\r\ncan take. That step is now pressed upon us, by the measures adopted,\r\nas if they were afraid we would not take it. Believe me, dear Sir,\r\nthere is not in the British empire a man who more cordially loves a\r\nunion with Great Britain, than I do. But by the God that made me, I\r\nwill cease to exist before I yield to a connection on such terms as the\r\nBritish Parliament propose; and in this, I think I speak the sentiments\r\nof America. We want neither inducement nor power, to declare and assert\r\na separation. It is will, alone, which is wanting, and that is growing\r\napace under the fostering hand of our King. One bloody campaign will\r\nprobably decide, everlastingly, our future course; and I am sorry to\r\nfind a bloody campaign is decided on. If our winds and waters should\r\nnot combine to rescue their shores from slavery, and General Howe's\r\nreinforcements should arrive in safety, we have hopes he will be\r\ninspirited to come out of Boston and take another drubbing; and we\r\nmust drub him soundly, before the sceptred tyrant will know we are not\r\nmere brutes, to crouch under his hand, and kiss the rod with which he\r\ndesigns to scourge us,\r\n\r\n                               Yours, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n                                             PHILADELPHIA, July 8, 1776.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--For news, I refer you to your brother, who writes on that\r\nhead. I enclose you a copy of the Declaration of Independence, as\r\nagreed to by the House, and also as originally framed. You will judge\r\nwhether it is the better or worse for the critics. I shall return\r\nto _Virginia_ after the 11th of _August_. I wish my successor may be\r\ncertain to come before that time; in that case I shall hope to see you,\r\nand not _Wythe_, in Convention, that the business of Government, which\r\nis of everlasting concern, may receive your aid.\r\n\r\n          Adieu, and believe me to be your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, PARIS.\r\n\r\n                                              VIRGINIA, August 13, 1777.\r\n\r\nHONORABLE SIR,--I forbear to write you news, as the time of Mr.\r\nShore's departure being uncertain, it might be old before you receive\r\nit, and he can, in person, possess you of all we have. With respect\r\nto the State of Virginia in particular, the people seem to have laid\r\naside the monarchical, and taken up the republican government, with\r\nas much ease as would have attended their throwing off an old, and\r\nputting on a new suit of clothes. Not a single throe has attended\r\nthis important transformation. A half-dozen aristocratical gentlemen,\r\nagonizing under the loss of pre-eminence, have sometimes ventured\r\ntheir sarcasms on our political metamorphosis. They have been thought\r\nfitter objects of pity, than of punishment. We are, at present, in the\r\ncomplete and quiet exercise of well-organized government, save only\r\nthat our courts of justice do not open till the fall. I think nothing\r\ncan bring the security of our continent and its cause into danger, if\r\nwe can support the credit of our paper. To do that, I apprehend, one\r\nof two steps must be taken. Either to procure free trade by alliance\r\nwith some naval power able to protect it; or, if we find there is no\r\nprospect of that, to shut our ports totally, to all the world, and turn\r\nour colonies into manufactories. The former would be most eligible,\r\nbecause most conformable to the habits and wishes of our people. Were\r\nthe British Court to return to their senses in time to seize the\r\nlittle advantage which still remains within their reach, from this\r\nquarter, I judge, that, on acknowledging our absolute independence\r\nand sovereignty, a commercial treaty beneficial to them, and perhaps\r\neven a league of mutual offence and defence, might, not seeing the\r\nexpense or consequences of such a measure, be approved by our people,\r\nif nothing, in the mean time, done on your part, should prevent it. But\r\nthey will continue to grasp at their desperate sovereignty, till every\r\nbenefit short of that is forever out of their reach. I wish my domestic\r\nsituation had rendered it possible for me to join you in the very\r\nhonorable charge confided to you. Residence in a polite Court, society\r\nof literati of the first order, a just cause and an approving God, will\r\nadd length to a life for which all men pray, and none more than\r\n\r\n                 Your most obedient and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                    ALBERMARLE, VIRGINIA, Aug. 21, 1777.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of May 26th came safely to hand. I wish it were\r\nin my power to suggest any remedy for the evil you complain of; though,\r\ndid any occur, I should propose it to you with great diffidence, after\r\nknowing you had thought on the subject yourself. There is indeed a fact\r\nwhich may not have come to your knowledge, out of which, perhaps, some\r\nlittle good may be drawn. The borrowing money in Europe, or obtaining\r\ncredit there for necessaries, has already probably been essayed, and it\r\nis supposed with some degree of success. But I expect your applications\r\nhave as yet been made only to France, Holland, or such other States as\r\nare of principal note. There is, however, a small power well disposed\r\nto our cause, and, as I am informed, possessed of abilities to assist\r\nus in this way. I speak of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. The little States\r\nof Italy, you know, have had long peace, and show no disposition to\r\ninterrupt that peace shortly. The Grand Duke, being somewhat avaricious\r\nin his nature, has availed himself of the opportunity of collecting\r\nand hoarding what money he has been able to gather. I am informed\r\nfrom good authority (an officer who was concerned in the business\r\nof his treasury) that about three years ago he had ten millions of\r\ncrowns lying dead in his coffers. Of this, it is thought possible as\r\nmuch might be borrowed as would amount to a million of pounds lawful\r\nmoney. At any rate, the attempt might be worth making. Perhaps an\r\napplication from Dr. Franklin, who has some acquaintance in that\r\ncourt, might be sufficient; or as it might be prudent to sound well\r\nbefore the application, in order to prevent the discredit of a rebuff,\r\nperhaps Congress would think it worth while to send a special agent\r\nthere to negotiate the matter. I think we have a gentleman here, who\r\nwould do it with dexterity and fidelity. He is a native of that Duchy,\r\nwell connected there, conversant in courts, of great understanding\r\nand equal zeal in our cause. He came over not long since to introduce\r\nthe cultivation of vines, olives, &c., among us. Should you think the\r\nmatter worth a further thought, either of the Cols. Lee's, to whom he\r\nis known, can acquaint you more fully of his character. If the money\r\ncan be obtained in specie, it may be applied to reduce the quantity\r\nof circulating paper, and be so managed as to help the credit of that\r\nwhich will remain in circulation. If credit alone can be obtained for\r\nthe manufactures of the country, it will still help us to clothe our\r\narmies, or to increase at market the necessaries our people want.\r\n\r\nWhat upon earth can Howe mean by the manœuvre he is now practicing?\r\nThere seems to me no object in this country which can be either of\r\nutility or reputation to his cause. I hope it will prove of a piece\r\nwith all the other follies they have committed. The forming a junction\r\nwith the northern army up the Hudson river, or taking possession of\r\nPhiladelphia, might have been a feather in his cap, and given them a\r\nlittle reputation in Europe--the former as being the design with which\r\nthey came, the latter as being a place of the first reputation abroad,\r\nand the residence of Congress. Here he may destroy the little hamlet of\r\nWilliamsburg, steal a few slaves, and lose half his army among the fens\r\nand marshes of our lower country, or by the heat of the climate.\r\n\r\n                       I am, dear sir, yours, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.[82]\r\n\r\n                                 WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA, June 8th, 1778.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of September 15th, 1777, from Paris, comes safe\r\nto hand. We have not, however, had the pleasure of seeing Mr. De\r\nCrenis, the bearer of it, in this country, as he joined the army in\r\nPennsylvania as soon as he arrived.\r\n\r\nI should have taken particular pleasure in serving him on your\r\nrecommendation. From the kind anxiety expressed in your letter,\r\nas well as from other sources of information, we discover that our\r\nenemies have filled Europe with Thrasonic accounts of victories they\r\nhad never won and conquests they were fated never to make. While these\r\naccounts alarmed our friends in Europe, they afforded us diversions.\r\nWe have long been out of all fear for the event of the war. I enclose\r\nyou a list of the killed, wounded, and captives of the enemy from\r\nthe commencement of hostilities at Lexington, in April, 1775, until\r\nNovember, 1777, since which time there has been no event of any\r\nconsequence. This is the best history of the war which can be brought\r\nwithin the compass of a letter. I believe the account to be near the\r\ntruth, though it is difficult to get at the numbers lost by an enemy\r\nwith absolute precision. Many of the articles have been communicated\r\nto us from England as taken from the official returns made by their\r\nGeneral. I wish it were in my power to send you as just an account\r\nof our loss. But this cannot be done without an application to the\r\nwar office, which, being in another county, is at this time out of\r\nmy reach. I think that upon the whole it has been about one-half the\r\nnumber lost by them; in some instances more, but in others less. This\r\ndifference is ascribed to our superiority in taking aim when we fire;\r\nevery soldier in our army having been intimate with his gun from his\r\ninfancy. If there could have been a doubt before as to the event of the\r\nwar, it is now totally removed by the interposition of France, and the\r\ngenerous alliance she has entered into with us. Though much of my time\r\nis employed in the councils of America, I have yet a little leisure to\r\nindulge my fondness for philosophical studies.\r\n\r\nI could wish to correspond with you on subjects of that kind. It might\r\nnot be unacceptable to you to be informed, for instance, of the true\r\npower of our climate, discoverable from the thermometer, from the force\r\nand direction of the winds, the quantity of rain, the plants which grow\r\nwithout shelter in winter, &c. On the other hand, we should be much\r\npleased with cotemporary observations on the same particulars in your\r\ncountry, which will give us a comparative view of the two climates.\r\nFarenheit's thermometer is the only one in use with us. I make my daily\r\nobservations as early as possible in the morning, and again about four\r\no'clock in the afternoon, generally showing the maxima of cold and heat\r\nin the course of 24 hours. I wish I could gratify your Botanical taste,\r\nbut I am acquainted with nothing more than the first principles of that\r\nscience; yet myself and my friends may furnish you with any Botanical\r\nsubjects which this country affords, and are not to be had with you,\r\nand I shall take pleasure in procuring them when pointed out by you.\r\nThe greatest difficulty will be the means of conveyance during the\r\ncontinuance of the war.\r\n\r\nIf there is a gratification, which I envy any people in this world,\r\nit is to your country its music. This is the favorite passion of\r\nmy soul, and fortune has cast my lot in a country where it is in\r\na state of deplorable barbarism. From the line of life in which we\r\nconjecture you to be, I have for some time lost the hope of seeing\r\nyou here. Should the event prove so, I shall ask your assistance in\r\nprocuring a substitute, who may be a proficient in singing, &c., on the\r\nHarpsichord. I should be contented to receive such an one two or three\r\nyears hence; when it is hoped he may come more safely and find here a\r\ngreater plenty of those useful things which commerce alone can furnish.\r\n\r\nThe bounds of an American fortune will not admit the indulgence of\r\na domestic band of musicians, yet I have thought that a passion for\r\nmusic might be reconciled with that economy which we are obliged to\r\nobserve. I retain among my domestic servants a gardener, a weaver, a\r\ncabinet-maker, and a stone-cutter, to which I would add a _vigneron_.\r\nIn a country where, like yours, music is cultivated and practiced by\r\nevery class of men, I suppose there might be found persons of these\r\ntrades who could perform on the French horn, clarinet, or hautboy,\r\nand bassoon, so that one might have a band of two French horns,\r\ntwo clarinets, two hautboys, and a bassoon, without enlarging their\r\ndomestic expenses. A certainty of employment for a half dozen years,\r\nand at the end of that time, to find them, if they chose, a conveyance\r\nto their own country, might induce them to come here on reasonable\r\nwages. Without meaning to give you trouble, perhaps it might be\r\npracticable for you, in your ordinary intercourse with your people, to\r\nfind out such men disposed to come to America. Sobriety and good nature\r\nwould be desirable parts of their characters. If you think such a plan\r\npracticable, and will be so kind as to inform me what will be necessary\r\nto be done on my part, I will take care that it shall be done. The\r\nnecessary expenses, when informed of them, I can remit before they are\r\nwanting, to any port in France, with which country alone we have safe\r\ncorrespondence. I am, Sir, with much esteem, your humble servant\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DAVID RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n                            MONTICELLO IN ALBEMARLE, VA., July 19, 1778.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I sincerely congratulate you on the recovery of\r\nPhiladelphia, and wish it may be found uninjured by the enemy. How far\r\nthe interests of literature may have suffered by the injury, or removal\r\nof the Orrery, (as it is miscalled,) the public libraries, your papers\r\nand implements, are doubts which still excite anxiety. We were much\r\ndisappointed in Virginia generally, on the day of the great eclipse,\r\nwhich proved to be cloudy.\r\n\r\nIn Williamsburg, where it was total, I understood only the beginning\r\nwas seen. At this place, which is lat. 38 8', and longitude west from\r\nWilliamsburg, about 1 45', as is conjectured, 11 digits only were\r\nsupposed to be covered. It was not seen at all until the moon had\r\nadvanced nearly one-third over the sun's disc. Afterwards it was seen\r\nat intervals through the whole. The egress particularly was visible.\r\nIt proved, however, of little use to me, for want of a time piece that\r\ncould be depended on, which circumstance, together with the subsequent\r\nrestoration of Philadelphia to you, has induced me to trouble you\r\nwith this letter, to remind you of your kind promise of making me an\r\naccurate clock, which, being intended for astronomical purposes only,\r\nI would have divested of all apparatus for striking, or for any other\r\npurpose, which, by increasing its complication, might disturb its\r\naccuracy. A companion to it for keeping seconds, and which might be\r\nmoved easily, would greatly add to its value. The Theodolite, for which\r\nI also spoke to you, I can now dispense with, having since purchased a\r\nmost excellent one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                         WILLIAMSBURG, January 22, 1779.\r\n\r\nDEAR PAGE,--I received your letter by Mr. Jamieson. It had given me\r\nmuch pain, that the zeal of our respective friends should ever have\r\nplaced you and me in the situation of competitors. I was comforted,\r\nhowever, with the reflection, that it was their competition, not\r\nours, and that the difference of the numbers which decided between us,\r\nwas too insignificant to give you a pain, or me a pleasure, had our\r\ndispositions towards each other been such as to admit those sensations.\r\nI know you too well to need an apology for anything you do, and hope\r\nyou will forever be assured of this; and as to the constructions of\r\nthe world, they would only have added one to the many sins for which\r\nthey are to go to the devil. As this is the first, I hope it will be\r\nthe last, instance of ceremony between us. A desire to see my family,\r\nwhich is in Charles City, carries me thither to-morrow, and I shall not\r\nreturn till Monday. Be pleased to present my compliments to Mrs. Page,\r\nand add this to the assurances I have ever given you, that I am, dear\r\nPage, your affectionate friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE WYTHE.\r\n\r\n                                                  FOREST, March 1, 1779.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since I left you, I have reflected on the bill regulating\r\nthe practising of attornies, and of our omitting to continue the\r\npractitioners at the County and General Courts separate. I think the\r\nbar of the General Court a proper and excellent nursery for future\r\njudges, if it be so regulated that science may be encouraged, and\r\nmay live there. But this can never be if an inundation of insects is\r\npermitted to come from the county courts, and consume the harvest.\r\nThese people, traversing the counties, seeing the clients frequently at\r\ntheir own courts, or, perhaps, at their own houses, must of necessity\r\npick up all the business. The convenience of frequently seeing their\r\ncounsel, without going from home, cannot be withstood by the country\r\npeople. Men of science, then, if there were to be any, would only be\r\nemployed as auxiliary counsel in difficult cases. But can they live by\r\nthat? Certainly not. The present members of that kind, therefore, must\r\nturn marauders in the county courts, and, in future, none will have\r\nleisure to acquire science. I should therefore be for excluding the\r\ncounty court attornies; or rather, for taking the general court lawyers\r\nfrom the incessant drudgery of the county courts and confining them\r\nto their studies, that they may qualify themselves as well to support\r\ntheir clients, as to become worthy successors to the bench. I hope to\r\nsee the time when the election of judges of the Supreme Courts shall be\r\nrestrained to the bars of the General Court and High Court of Chancery:\r\nfor when I speak of the former above, I mean to include the latter. I\r\nshould, even in our present bill, have no objection to inserting such\r\na restriction to take place seven or fourteen years hence. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY PATRICK HENRY.\r\n\r\n                                              ALBEMARLE, March 27, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,--A report prevailing here, that in consequence of some powers from\r\nCongress, the Governor and Council have it in contemplation to remove\r\nthe Convention troops,[83] either wholly or in part, from their present\r\nsituation, I take the liberty of troubling you with some observations\r\non that subject. The reputation and interest of our country, in\r\ngeneral, may be affected by such a measure: it would, therefore, hardly\r\nbe deemed an indecent liberty in the most private citizen, to offer\r\nhis thoughts to the consideration of the Executive. The locality of my\r\nsituation, particularly in the neighborhood of the present barracks,\r\nand the public relation in which I stand to the people among whom they\r\nare situated, together with a confidence which a personal knowledge\r\nof the members of the Executive gives me, that they will be glad of\r\ninformation from any quarter, on a subject interesting to the public,\r\ninduce me to hope that they will acquit me of impropriety in the\r\npresent representation.\r\n\r\nBy an article in the Convention of Saratoga, it is stipulated, on the\r\npart of the United States, that the officers shall not be separated\r\nfrom their men. I suppose the term officers, includes _general_ as\r\nwell as _regimental_ officers. As there are general officers who\r\ncommand all the troops, no part of them can be separated from these\r\nofficers without a violation of the article: they cannot, of course,\r\nbe separated from one another, unless the same general officer could\r\nbe in different places at the same time. It is true, the article adds\r\nthe words, \"as far as circumstances will admit.\" This was a necessary\r\nqualification; because, in no place in America, I suppose, could there\r\nhave been found quarters for both officers and men together; those\r\nfor the officers to be according to their rank. So far, then, as the\r\ncircumstances of the place where they should be quartered, should\r\nrender a separation necessary, in order to procure quarters for the\r\nofficers, according to their rank, the article admits that separation.\r\nAnd these are the circumstances which must have been under the\r\ncontemplation of the parties; both of whom, and all the world beside\r\n(who are ultimate judges in the case), would still understand that they\r\nwere to be as near in the environs of the camp, as convenient quarters\r\ncould be procured; and not that the qualification of the article\r\ndestroyed the article itself, and laid it wholly at our discretion.\r\nCongress, indeed, have admitted of this separation; but are they so\r\nfar lords of right and wrong as that our consciences may be quiet with\r\ntheir dispensation? Or is the case amended by saying they leave it\r\noptional in the Governor and Council to separate the troops or not? At\r\nthe same time that it exculpates not them, it is drawing the Governor\r\nand Council into a participation in the breach of faith. If indeed it\r\nis only proposed, that a separation of the troops shall be referred to\r\nthe consent of their officers; that is a very different matter. Having\r\ncarefully avoided conversation with them on public subjects, I cannot\r\nsay, of my own knowledge, how they would relish such a proposition.\r\nI have heard from others, that they will choose to undergo anything\r\ntogether, rather than to be separated, and that they will remonstrate\r\nagainst it in the strongest terms. The Executive, therefore, if\r\nvoluntary agents in this measure, must be drawn into a paper war with\r\nthem, the more disagreeable, as it seems that faith and reason will be\r\non the other side. As an American, I cannot help feeling a thorough\r\nmortification, that our Congress should have permitted an infraction\r\nof our public honor; as a citizen of Virginia, I cannot help hoping and\r\nconfiding, that our Supreme Executive, whose acts will be considered as\r\nthe acts of the Commonwealth, estimate that honor too highly to make\r\nits infraction their own act. I may be permitted to hope, then, that\r\nif any removal takes place, it will be a general one; and, as it is\r\nsaid to be left to the Governor and Council to determine on this, I am\r\nsatisfied that, suppressing every other consideration, and weighing the\r\nmatter dispassionately, they will determine upon this sole question,\r\nIs it for the benefit of those for whom they act, that the Convention\r\ntroops should be removed from among them? Under the head of interest,\r\nthese circumstances, viz., the expense of building barracks, said to\r\nhave been £25,000, and of removing the troops backwards and forwards,\r\namounting to, I know not how much, are not to be pretermitted, merely\r\nbecause they are Continental expenses; for we are a part of the\r\nContinent; we must pay a shilling of every dollar wasted. But the sums\r\nof money which, by these troops, or on their account, are brought into,\r\nand expended in this State, are a great and local advantage. This can\r\nrequire no proof. If, at the conclusion of the war, for instance, our\r\nshare of the Continental debt should be twenty millions of dollars, or\r\nsay that we are called on to furnish an annual quota of two millions\r\nfour hundred thousand dollars, to Congress, to be raised by tax, it\r\nis obvious that we should raise these given sums with greater or less\r\nease, in proportion to the greater or less quantity of money found\r\nin circulation among us. I expect that our circulating money is, by\r\nthe presence of these troops, at the rate of $30,000 a week, at the\r\nleast. I have heard, indeed, that an objection arises to their being\r\nkept within this State, from the information of the commissary that\r\nthey cannot be subsisted here. In attending to the information of that\r\nofficer, it should be borne in mind that the county of King William\r\nand its vicinities are one thing, the territory of Virginia another.\r\nIf the troops could be fed upon long letters, I believe the gentleman\r\nat the head of that department in this country, would be the best\r\ncommissary upon earth. But till I see him determined to act, not to\r\nwrite; to sacrifice his domestic ease to the duties of his appointment,\r\nand apply to the resources of this country, wheresoever they are to\r\nbe had, I must entertain a different opinion of him. I am mistaken\r\nif, for the animal subsistence of the troops hitherto, we are not\r\nprincipally indebted to the genius and exertions of Hawkins, during\r\nthe very short time he lived after his appointment to that department,\r\nby your board. His eye immediately pervaded the whole State, it was\r\nreduced at once to a regular machine, to a system, and the whole put\r\ninto movement and animation by the fiat of a comprehensive mind. If\r\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia cannot furnish these troops with bread,\r\nI would ask of the commissariat, which of the thirteen is now become\r\nthe grain colony? If we are in danger of famine from the addition of\r\nfour thousand mouths, what is become of that surplus of bread, the\r\nexportation of which used to feed the West Indies and Eastern States,\r\nand fill the colony with hard money? When I urge the sufficiency of\r\nthis State, however, to subsist these troops, I beg to be understood,\r\nas having in contemplation the quantity of provisions necessary for\r\ntheir real use, and not as calculating what is to be lost by the\r\nwanton waste, mismanagement, and carelessness of those employed about\r\nit. If magazines of beef and pork are suffered to rot by slovenly\r\nbutchering, or for want of timely provision and sale; if quantities of\r\nflour are exposed, by the commissaries entrusted with the keeping it,\r\nto pillage and destruction; and if, when laid up in the Continental\r\nstores, it is still to be embezzled and sold, the land of Egypt itself\r\nwould be insufficient for their supply, and their removal would be\r\nnecessary, not to a more plentiful country, but to more able and honest\r\ncommissaries. Perhaps the magnitude of this question, and its relation\r\nto the whole State, may render it worth while to await the opinion of\r\nthe National Council, which is now to meet within a few weeks. There is\r\nno danger of distress in the meantime, as the commissaries affirm they\r\nhave a great sufficiency of provisions for some time to come. Should\r\nthe measure of removing them into another State be adopted, and carried\r\ninto execution, before the meeting of Assembly, no disapprobation of\r\ntheirs will bring them back, because they will then be in the power of\r\nothers, who will hardly give them up.\r\n\r\nWant of information as to what may be the precise measure proposed by\r\nthe Governor and Council, obliges me to shift my ground, and take up\r\nthe subject in every possible form. Perhaps, they have not thought to\r\nremove the troops out of this State altogether, but to some other part\r\nof it. Here, the objections arising from the expenses of removal, and\r\nof building new barracks, recur. As to animal food, it may be driven\r\nto one part of the country as easily as to another: that circumstance,\r\ntherefore, may be thrown out of the question. As to bread, I suppose\r\nthey will require about forty or forty-five thousand bushels of grain\r\na year. The place to which it is to be brought to them, is about the\r\ncentre of the State. Besides, that the country round about is fertile,\r\nall the grain made in the counties adjacent to any kind of navigation,\r\nmay be brought by water to within twelve miles of the spot. For these\r\ntwelve miles, wagons must be employed; I suppose half a dozen will\r\nbe a plenty. Perhaps, this part of the expense might have been saved,\r\nhad the barracks been built on the water; but it is not sufficient to\r\njustify their being abandoned now they are built. Wagonage, indeed,\r\nseems to the commissariat an article not worth economising. The most\r\nwanton and studied circuity of transportation has been practised: to\r\nmention only one act, they have bought quantities of flour for these\r\ntroops in Cumberland, have ordered it to be wagoned down to Manchester,\r\nand wagoned thence up to the barracks. This fact happened to fall\r\nwithin my own knowledge. I doubt not there are many more such, in\r\norder either to produce their total removal, or to run up the expenses\r\nof the present situation, and satisfy Congress that the nearer they\r\nare brought to the commissary's own bed, the cheaper they will be\r\nsubsisted. The grain made in the western counties may be brought partly\r\nin wagons, as conveniently to this as to any other place; perhaps more\r\nso, on account of its vicinity to one of the best passes through the\r\nBlue Ridge; and partly by water, as it is near to James river, to the\r\nnavigation of which, ten counties are adjacent above the falls. When I\r\nsaid that the grain might be brought hither from all the counties of\r\nthe State adjacent to navigation, I did not mean to say it would be\r\nproper to bring it from all. On the contrary, I think the commissary\r\nshould be instructed, after the next harvest, not to send one bushel\r\nof grain to the barracks from below the falls of the rivers, or from\r\nthe northern counties. The counties on tide water are accessible to\r\nthe calls for our own army. Their supplies ought, therefore, to be\r\nhusbanded for them. The counties in the northwestern parts of the\r\nState are not only within reach for our own grand army, but peculiarly\r\nnecessary for the support of Macintosh's army; or for the support of\r\nany other northwestern expedition, which the uncertain conduct of the\r\nIndians should render necessary; insomuch, that if the supplies of that\r\nquarter should be misapplied to any other purpose, it would destroy, in\r\nembryo, every exertion, either for particular or general safety there.\r\nThe counties above tide water, in the middle and southern and western\r\nparts of the country, are not accessible to calls for either of those\r\npurposes, but at such an expense of transportation as the article would\r\nnot bear. Here, then, is a great field, whose supplies of bread cannot\r\nbe carried to our army, or rather, which will raise no supplies of\r\nbread, because there is nobody to eat them. Was it not, then, wise in\r\nCongress to remove to that field four thousand idle mouths, who must\r\notherwise have interfered with the pasture of our own troops? And, if\r\nthey are removed to any other part of the country, will it not defeat\r\nthis wise purpose? The mills on the waters of James river, above the\r\nfalls, open to canoe navigation, are very many. Some of them are of\r\ngreat note, as manufacturers. The barracks are surrounded by mills.\r\nThere are five or six round about Charlottesville. Any two or three\r\nof the whole might, in the course of the winter, manufacture flour\r\nsufficient for the year. To say the worst, then, of this situation, it\r\nis but twelve miles wrong. The safe custody of these troops is another\r\ncircumstance worthy consideration. Equally removed from the access of\r\nan eastern or western enemy; central to the whole State, so that should\r\nthey attempt an irruption in any direction, they must pass through a\r\ngreat extent of hostile country; in a neighborhood thickly inhabited by\r\na robust and hardy people, zealous in the American cause, acquainted\r\nwith the use of arms, and the defiles and passes by which they must\r\nissue: it would seem, that in this point of view, no place could have\r\nbeen better chosen.\r\n\r\nTheir health is also of importance. I would not endeavor to show that\r\ntheir lives are valuable to us, because it would suppose a possibility,\r\nthat humanity was kicked out of doors in America, and interest only\r\nattended to. The barracks occupy the top and brow of a very high hill,\r\n(you have been untruly told they were in a bottom.) They are free from\r\nfog, have four springs which seem to be plentiful, one within twenty\r\nyards of the piquet, two within fifty yards, and another within two\r\nhundred and fifty, and they propose to sink wells within the piquet. Of\r\nfour thousand people, it should be expected, according to the ordinary\r\ncalculations, that one should die every day. Yet, in the space of near\r\nthree months, there have been but four deaths among them; two infants\r\nunder three weeks old, and two others by apoplexy. The officers tell\r\nme, the troops were never before so healthy since they were embodied.\r\n\r\nBut is an enemy so execrable, that, though in captivity, his wishes\r\nand comforts are to be disregarded and even crossed? I think not. It\r\nis for the benefit of mankind to mitigate the horrors of war as much\r\nas possible. The practice, therefore, of modern nations, of treating\r\ncaptive enemies with politeness and generosity, is not only delightful\r\nin contemplation, but really interesting to all the world, friends,\r\nfoes and neutrals. Let us apply this: the officers, after considerable\r\nhardships, have all procured quarters, comfortable and satisfactory\r\nto them. In order to do this, they were obliged, in many instances,\r\nto hire houses for a year certain, and at such exorbitant rents, as\r\nwere sufficient to tempt independent owners to go out of them, and\r\nshift as they could. These houses, in most cases, were much out of\r\nrepair. They have repaired them at a considerable expense. One of the\r\ngeneral officers has taken a place for two years, advanced the rent\r\nfor the whole time, and been obliged, moreover, to erect additional\r\nbuildings for the accommodation of part of his family, for which there\r\nwas not room in the house rented. Independent of the brick work, for\r\nthe carpentry of these additional buildings, I know he is to pay\r\nfifteen hundred dollars. The same gentleman, to my knowledge, has\r\npaid to one person three thousand six hundred and seventy dollars for\r\ndifferent articles to fix himself commodiously. They have generally\r\nlaid in their stocks of grain and other provisions, for it is well\r\nknown that officers do not live on their rations. They have purchased\r\ncows, sheep, &c., set in to farming, prepared their gardens, and have\r\na prospect of comfort and quiet before them. To turn to the soldiers:\r\nthe environs of the barracks are delightful, the ground cleared, laid\r\noff in hundreds of gardens, each enclosed in its separate paling; these\r\nwell prepared, and exhibiting a fine appearance. General Riedezel alone\r\nlaid out upwards of two hundred pounds in garden seeds for the German\r\ntroops only. Judge what an extent of ground these seeds would cover.\r\nThere is little doubt that their own gardens will furnish them a great\r\nabundance of vegetables through the year. Their poultry, pigeons and\r\nother preparations of that kind, present to the mind the idea of a\r\ncompany of farmers, rather than a camp of soldiers. In addition to the\r\nbarracks built for them by the public, and now very comfortable, they\r\nhave built great numbers for themselves, in such messes as fancied each\r\nother; and the whole corps, both officers and men, seem now happy and\r\nsatisfied with their situation. Having thus found the art of rendering\r\ncaptivity itself comfortable, and carried it into execution, at their\r\nown great expense and labor, their spirits sustained by the prospect\r\nof gratifications rising before their eyes, does not every sentiment\r\nof humanity revolt against the proposition of stripping them of all\r\nthis, and removing them into new situations, where, from the advanced\r\nseason of the year, no preparations can be made for carrying themselves\r\ncomfortably through the heats of summer; and when it is known that\r\nthe necessary advances for the conveniences already provided, have\r\nexhausted their funds and left them unable to make the like exertions\r\nanew. Again, review this matter, as it may regard appearances. A body\r\nof troops, after staying a twelvemonth at Boston, are ordered to take a\r\nmarch of seven hundred miles to Virginia, where, it is said, they may\r\nbe plentifully subsisted. As soon as they are there, they are ordered\r\non some other march, because, in Virginia, it is said, they cannot be\r\nsubsisted. Indifferent nations will charge this either to ignorance,\r\nor to whim and caprice; the parties interested, to cruelty. They now\r\nview the proposition in that light, and it is said, there is a general\r\nand firm persuasion among them, that they were marched from Boston with\r\nno other purpose than to harass and destroy them with eternal marches.\r\nPerseverance in object, though not by the most direct way, is often\r\nmore laudable than perpetual changes, as often as the object shifts\r\nlight. A character of steadiness in our councils, is worth more than\r\nthe subsistence of four thousand people.\r\n\r\nThere could not have been a more unlucky concurrence of circumstances\r\nthan when these troops first came. The barracks were unfinished for\r\nwant of laborers, the spell of weather the worst ever known within\r\nthe memory of man, no stores of bread laid in, the roads, by the\r\nweather and number of wagons, soon rendered impassable: not only the\r\ntroops themselves were greatly disappointed, but the people in the\r\nneighborhood were alarmed at the consequences which a total failure\r\nof provisions might produce. In this worst state of things, their\r\nsituation was seen by many and disseminated through the country, so\r\nas to occasion a general dissatisfaction, which even seized the minds\r\nof reasonable men, who, if not affected by the contagion, must have\r\nforeseen that the prospect must brighten, and that great advantages to\r\nthe people must necessarily arise. It has, accordingly, so happened.\r\nThe planters, being more generally sellers than buyers, have felt the\r\nbenefit of their presence in the most vital part about them, their\r\npurses, and are now sensible of its source. I have too good an opinion\r\nof their love of order to believe that a removal of these troops would\r\nproduce any irregular proofs of their disapprobation, but I am well\r\nassured it would be extremely odious to them.\r\n\r\nTo conclude. The separation of these troops would be a breach of public\r\nfaith, therefore I suppose it is impossible; if they are removed to\r\nanother State, it is the fault of the commissaries; if they are removed\r\nto any other part of the State, it is the fault of the commissaries;\r\nand in both cases, the public interest and public security suffer, the\r\ncomfortable and plentiful subsistence of our own army is lessened,\r\nthe health of the troops neglected, their wishes crossed, and their\r\ncomforts torn from them, the character of whim and caprice, or, what\r\nis worse, of cruelty, fixed on us as a nation, and, to crown the whole,\r\nour own people disgusted with such a proceeding.\r\n\r\nI have thus taken the liberty of representing to you the facts and the\r\nreasons, which seem to militate against the separation or removal of\r\nthese troops. I am sensible, however, that the same subject may appear\r\nto different persons, in very different lights. What I have urged as\r\nreasons, may, to sounder minds, be apparent fallacies. I hope they will\r\nappear, at least, so plausible, as to excuse the interposition of\r\n\r\n        Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                            WILLIAMSBURG, June 23, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the pleasure to enclose you the particulars of Colonel\r\nClarke's success against St. Vincennes, as stated in his letter but\r\nlately received; the messenger, with his first letter, having been\r\nkilled. I fear it will be impossible for Colonel Clarke to be so\r\nstrengthened, as to enable him to do what he desires. Indeed, the\r\nexpress who brought this letter, gives us reason to fear St. Vincennes\r\nis in danger from a large body of Indians collected to attack it, and\r\nsaid, when he came from Kaskaskias, to be within thirty leagues of the\r\nplace. I also enclose you a letter from Colonel Shelby, stating the\r\neffect of his success against the seceding Cherokees, and Chuccamogga.\r\nThe damage done them, was killing half a dozen, burning eleven towns,\r\ntwenty thousand bushels of corn, collected probably to forward the\r\nexpeditions which were to have been planned at the council which was\r\nto meet Governor Hamilton at the mouth of the Tennessee, and taking as\r\nmany goods as sold for twenty-five thousand pounds. I hope these two\r\nblows coming together, and the depriving them of their head, will, in\r\nsome measure, effect the quiet of our frontiers this summer. We have\r\nintelligence, also, that Colonel Bowman, from Kentucky, is in the midst\r\nof the Shawnee country, with three hundred men, and hope to hear a good\r\naccount of him. The enclosed order, being in its nature important, and\r\ngenerally interesting, I think it proper to transmit it to you, with\r\nthe reasons supporting it.[84] It will add much to our satisfaction, to\r\nknow it meets your approbation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with every sentiment of private respect and\r\npublic gratitude,\r\n\r\n            Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nP. S.--The distance of our northern and western counties, from the\r\nscene of southern service, and the necessity of strengthening our\r\nwestern quarter, have induced the Council to direct the new levies\r\nfrom the counties of Yohogania, Ohio, Monongalia, Frederick, Hampshire,\r\nBerkeley, Rockingham, and Greenbrier, amounting to somewhat less than\r\nthree hundred men, to enter into the ninth regiment at Pittsburg. The\r\naid they may give there, will be so immediate and important, and what\r\nthey could do to the southward, would be so late, as, I hope, will\r\napologise for their interference.\r\n\r\n                                                                   T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                            WILLIAMSBURG, July 17, 1799.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I some time ago, enclosed to you a printed copy of an order\r\nof Council, by which Governor Hamilton was to be confined in irons,\r\nin close jail, which has occasioned a letter from General Phillips,\r\nof which the enclosed is a copy. The General seems to think that a\r\nprisoner on capitulation, cannot be put in close confinement, though\r\nhis capitulation should not have provided against it. My idea was, that\r\nall persons taken in war, were to be deemed prisoners of war. That\r\nthose who surrender on capitulation (or convention) are prisoners of\r\nwar also, subject to the same treatment with those who surrender at\r\ndiscretion, except only so far as the terms of their capitulation or\r\nconvention shall have guarded them. In the capitulation of Governor\r\nHamilton (a copy of which I enclose), no stipulation is made as to the\r\ntreatment of himself, or those taken with him. The Governor, indeed,\r\nwhen he signs, adds a flourish of reasons inducing him to capitulate,\r\none of which is the generosity of his enemy. Generosity, on a large\r\nand comprehensive scale, seems to dictate the making a signal example\r\nof this gentleman; but waving that, these are the only private motives\r\ninducing him to surrender, and do not enter into the contract of\r\nColonel Clarke. I have the highest idea of those contracts which take\r\nplace between nation and nation, at war, and would be the last on earth\r\nto do anything in violation of them. I can find nothing in those books\r\nusually recurred to as testimonials of the law and usages of nature and\r\nnations, which convicts the opinions I have above expressed of error.\r\nYet there may be such an usage as General Phillips seems to suppose,\r\nthough not taken notice of by these writers. I am obliged to trouble\r\nyour Excellency on this occasion, by asking of you information on this\r\npoint. There is no other person, whose decision will so authoritatively\r\ndecide this doubt in the public mind, and none with which I am\r\ndisposed so implicitly to comply. If you shall be of opinion, that the\r\nbare existence of a capitulation, in the case of Governor Hamilton,\r\nprivileges him from confinement, though there be no article to that\r\neffect in the capitulation, justice shall most assuredly be done him.\r\nThe importance of this point, in a public view, and my own anxiety\r\nunder a charge of violation of national faith by the Executive of this\r\nCommonwealth, will, I hope, apologise for my adding this to the many\r\ntroubles with which I know you to be burdened. I have the honor to be,\r\nwith the most profound respect,\r\n\r\n        Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I have just received a letter from Colonel Bland, containing\r\ninformation of numerous desertions from the Convention troops, not\r\nless than four hundred in the last fortnight. He thinks he has reason\r\nto believe it is with the connivance of some of their officers. Some\r\nof these have been retaken, all of them going northwardly. They had\r\nprovided themselves with forged passports, and with certificates of\r\nhaving taken the oath of fidelity to the State; some of them forged,\r\nothers really given by weak magistrates. I give this information to\r\nyour Excellency, as, perhaps, it may be in your power to have such of\r\nthem intercepted as shall be passing through Pennsylvania and Jersey.\r\n\r\nYour letter enclosing the opinion of the board of war in the case of\r\nAllison and Lee, has come safe to hand, after a long passage. It shall\r\nbe answered by next post.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                          WILLIAMSBURG, October 1, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On receipt of your letter of August 6th, during my absence,\r\nthe Council had the irons taken off the prisoners of war. When your\r\nadvice was asked, we meant it should decide with us; and upon my\r\nreturn to Williamsburg, the matter was taken up and the enclosed advice\r\ngiven.[85] A parole was formed, of which the enclosed is a copy, and\r\ntendered to the prisoners. They objected to that part of it, which\r\nrestrained them from _saying_ anything to the prejudice of the United\r\nStates, and insisted on \"freedom of speech.\" They were, in consequence,\r\nremanded to their confinement in the jail, which must be considered\r\nas a voluntary one, until they can determine with themselves to be\r\ninoffensive in word as well as deed. A flag sails hence to-morrow to\r\nNew York, to negotiate the exchange of some prisoners. By her, I have\r\nwritten to General Phillips on this subject, and enclosed to him copies\r\nof the within; intending it as an answer to a letter I received from\r\nhim on the subject of Governor Hamilton. I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                             WILLIAMSBURG, Oct. 2, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Just as the letter accompanying this was going off, Colonel\r\nMathews arrived on parole from New York, by the way of head-quarters,\r\nbringing your Excellency's letter, on his subject, with that of the\r\nBritish commissary of prisoners. The subject is of great importance,\r\nand I must, therefore, reserve myself to answer after further\r\nconsideration. Were I to speak from present impressions, I should\r\nsay it was happy for Governor Hamilton, that a final determination\r\nof his fate was formed before this new information. As the enemy have\r\nreleased Captain Willing from his irons, the Executive of this State\r\nwill be induced, perhaps, not to alter their former opinion. But it\r\nis impossible they can be serious in attempting to bully us in this\r\nmanner. We have too many of their subjects in our power, and, too much\r\niron to clothe them with, and I will add, too much resolution to avail\r\nourselves of both, to fear their pretended retaliation. However, I\r\nwill do myself the honor of forwarding to your Excellency the ultimate\r\nresult of Council on this subject.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the information in the letter from the British\r\ncommissary of prisoners, that no officers of the Virginia line should\r\nbe exchanged till Governor Hamilton's affair should be settled, we\r\nhave stopped our flag, which was just hoisting anchor with a load\r\nof privates for New York. I must, therefore, ask the favor of your\r\nExcellency to forward the enclosed by flag, when an opportunity offers,\r\nas I suppose General Phillips will be in New York before it reaches\r\nyou. I have the honor to be, Sir, with the greatest esteem,\r\n\r\n              Your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                               IN COUNCIL, Oct. 8, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In mine of the second of the present month, written in the\r\ninstant of Colonel Mathews' delivery of your letter, I informed\r\nyou what had been done on the subject of Governor Hamilton and his\r\ncompanions, previous to that moment. I now enclose you an advice\r\nof Council,[86] in consequence of the letter you were pleased to\r\nenclose me, from the British commissary of prisoners, with one from\r\nLord Rawdon; also a copy of my letter to Colonel Mathews, enclosing,\r\nalso, the papers therein named. The advice of Council to allow the\r\nenlargement of prisoners, on their giving a proper parole, has not been\r\nrecalled, nor will be, I suppose, unless something on the part of the\r\nenemy should render it necessary. I rather expect, however, that they\r\nwill see it their interest to discontinue this kind of conduct. I am\r\nafraid I shall hereafter, perhaps, be obliged to give your Excellency\r\nsome trouble in aiding me to obtain information of the future usage of\r\nour prisoners. I shall give immediate orders for having in readiness\r\nevery engine which the enemy have contrived for the destruction of\r\nour unhappy citizens, captured by them. The presentiment of these\r\noperations is shocking beyond expression. I pray heaven to avert them;\r\nbut nothing in this world will do it, but a proper conduct in the\r\nenemy. In every event, I shall resign myself to the hard necessity\r\nunder which I shall act.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great regard and esteem, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MATHEWS.\r\n\r\n                                              IN COUNCIL, October, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The proceedings respecting Governor Hamilton and his companions,\r\nprevious to your arrival here, you are acquainted with. For your more\r\nprecise information, I enclose you the advice of Council, of June the\r\n16th, of that of August the 28th, another of September the 19th, on the\r\nparole tendered them the 1st instant, and Governor Hamilton's letter\r\nof the same day, stating his objections, in which he persevered: from\r\nthat time his confinement has become a voluntary one. You delivered us\r\nyour letters the next day, when the post being just setting out, much\r\nbusiness prevented the Council from taking them into consideration.\r\nThey have this day attended to them, and found their resolution\r\nexpressed in the enclosed advice, bearing date this day. It gives\r\nus great pain that any of our countrymen should be cut off from the\r\nsociety of their friends and tenderest connections, while it seems as\r\nif it was in our power to administer relief. But we trust to their\r\ngood sense for discerning, and their spirit for bearing up against\r\nthe fallacy of this appearance. Governor Hamilton and his companions\r\nwere imprisoned and ironed, 1st. In retaliation for cruel treatment of\r\nour captive citizens by the enemy in general. 2d. For the barbarous\r\nspecies of warfare which himself and his savage allies carried on\r\nin our western frontier. 3d. For particular acts of barbarity, of\r\nwhich he himself was personally guilty, to some of our citizens in\r\nhis power. Any one of these charges was sufficient to justify the\r\nmeasures we took. Of the truth of the first, yourselves are witnesses.\r\nYour situation, indeed, seems to have been better since you were sent\r\nto New York; but reflect on what you suffered before that, and knew\r\nothers of your countrymen to suffer, and what you know is now suffered\r\nby that more unhappy part of them who are still confined on board the\r\nprison ships of the enemy. Proofs of the second charge, we have under\r\nHamilton's own hand; and of the third, as sacred assurances as human\r\ntestimony is capable of giving. Humane conduct on our part was found\r\nto produce no effect; the contrary, therefore, was to be tried. If it\r\nproduces a proper lenity to our citizens in captivity, it will have\r\nthe effect we meant; if it does not, we shall return a severity as\r\nterrible as universal. If the causes of our rigor against Hamilton were\r\nfounded in truth, that rigor was just, and would not give right to the\r\nenemy to commence any new hostilities on their part; and all such new\r\nseverities are to be considered, not as retaliation, but as original\r\nand unprovoked. If those causes were not founded in truth, they should\r\nhave denied them. If, declining the tribunal of truth and reason, they\r\nchoose to pervert this into a contest of cruelty and destruction, we\r\nwill contend with them in that line, and measure out misery to those\r\nin our power, in that multiplied proportion which the advantage of\r\nsuperior numbers enables us to do. We shall think it our particular\r\nduty, after the information we gather from the papers which have been\r\nlaid before us, to pay very constant attention to your situation and\r\nthat of your fellow prisoners. We hope that the prudence of the enemy\r\nwill be your protection from injury; and we are assured that your\r\nregard for the honor of your country, would not permit you to wish\r\nwe should suffer ourselves to be bullied into an acquiescence, under\r\nevery insult and cruelty they may choose to practice, and a fear to\r\nretaliate, lest you should be made to experience additional sufferings.\r\nTheir officers and soldiers, in our hands are pledges for your safety:\r\nwe are determined to use them as such. Iron will be retaliated by iron,\r\nbut a great multiplication on distinguished objects: prison ships by\r\nprison ships, and like for like in general. I do not mean by this to\r\ncover any officer who has acted, or shall act improperly. They say\r\nCaptain Willing was guilty of great cruelties at the Natches; if so,\r\nthey do right in punishing him. I would use any powers I have, for the\r\npunishment of any officer of our own, who should be guilty of excesses\r\nunjustifiable under the usages of civilized nations. However, I do not\r\nfind myself obliged to believe the charge against Captain Willing to\r\nbe true, on the affirmation of the British commissary, because, in the\r\nnext breath, he affirms no cruelties have as yet been inflicted on him.\r\nCaptain Willing has been in irons.\r\n\r\nI beg you to be assured, there is nothing, consistent with the honor\r\nof your country, which we shall not, at all times, be ready to do for\r\nthe relief of yourself and companions in captivity. We know that ardent\r\nspirit and hatred for tyranny, which brought you into your present\r\nsituation, will enable you to bear up against it with the firmness\r\nwhich has distinguished you as a soldier, and to look forward with\r\npleasure to the day, when events shall take place, against which,\r\nthe wounded spirits of your enemies will find no comfort, even from\r\nreflections on the most refined of the cruelties with which they have\r\nglutted themselves.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                      WILLIAMSBURG, November 28th, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your Excellency's letter on the discriminations which have been\r\nheretofore made, between the troops raised within this State, and\r\nconsidered as part of our quota, and those not so considered, was\r\ndelivered me four days ago. I immediately laid it before the Assembly,\r\nwho thereupon came to the resolution I now do myself the honor of\r\nenclosing you. The resolution of Congress, of March 15th, 1779, which\r\nyou were so kind as to enclose, was never known in this State till\r\na few weeks ago, when we received printed copies of the Journals of\r\nCongress. It would be a great satisfaction to us, to receive an exact\r\nreturn of all the men we have in Continental service, who come within\r\nthe description of the resolution, together with our State troops\r\nin Continental service. Colonel Cabell was so kind as to send me a\r\nreturn of the Continental regiments commanded by Lord Sterling, of\r\nthe first and second Virginia State regiments, and of Colonel Gist's\r\nregiment. Besides these are the following; viz., Colonel Harrison's\r\nregiment of artillery, Colonel Bayler's horse, Colonel Bland's horse,\r\nGeneral Scott's new levies, part of which are gone to Carolina, and\r\npart are here, Colonel Gibson's regiment stationed on the Ohio, Heath\r\nand O'Hara's independent companies at the same stations, Colonel\r\nTaylor's regiment of guards to the Convention troops: of these, we\r\nhave a return. There may, possibly, be others not occurring to me.\r\nA return of all these would enable us to see what proportion of the\r\nContinental army is contributed by us. We have, at present, very\r\npressing calls to send additional numbers of men to the southward. No\r\ninclination is wanting in either the Legislature or Executive, to aid\r\nthem or strengthen you; but we find it very difficult to procure men.\r\nI herewith transmit to your Excellency some recruiting commissions,\r\nto be put into such hands as you may think proper, for re-enlisting\r\nsuch of our soldiery as are not already engaged for the war. The Act\r\nof Assembly, authorizing these instructions, requires that the men\r\nenlisted should be reviewed and received by an officer to be appointed\r\nfor that purpose; a caution less necessary in the case of men now\r\nactually in service, and, therefore, doubtless, able bodied, than in\r\nthe raising new recruits. The direction, however, goes to all cases,\r\nand, therefore, we must trouble your Excellency with the appointment of\r\none or more officers of review. Mr. Moss, our agent, receives orders,\r\nwhich accompany this, to pay the bounty money and recruiting money,\r\nand to deliver the clothing. We have, however, certain reason to fear\r\nhe has not any great sum of money on hand; and it is absolutely out of\r\nour power, at this time, to supply him, or to say, with certainty, when\r\nwe shall be able to do it. He is instructed to note his acceptances\r\nunder the draughts, and to assure payment as soon as we shall have it\r\nin our power to furnish him, as the only substitute for money. Your\r\nExcellency's directions to the officer of review, will probably procure\r\nus the satisfaction of being informed, from time to time, how many men\r\nshall be re-enlisted.\r\n\r\nBy Colonel Mathews, I informed your Excellency fully of the situation\r\nof Governor Hamilton and his companions. Lamothe and Dejean have given\r\ntheir paroles, and are at Hanover Court-House: Hamilton, Hay, and\r\nothers, are still obstinate; therefore, still in close confinement,\r\nthough their irons have never been on, since your second letter on the\r\nsubject. I wrote full information of this matter to General Phillips\r\nalso, from whom I had received letters on the subject. I cannot, in\r\nreason, believe that the enemy, on receiving this information, either\r\nfrom yourself or General Phillips, will venture to impose any new\r\ncruelties on our officers in captivity with them. Yet their conduct,\r\nhitherto, has been most successfully prognosticated by reversing\r\nthe conclusions of right reason. It is, therefore, my duty, as well\r\nas it was my promise to the Virginia captives, to take measures for\r\ndiscovering any change which may be made in their situation. For this\r\npurpose, I must apply for your Excellency's interposition. I doubt not\r\nbut you have an established mode of knowing, at all times, through your\r\ncommissary of prisoners, the precise state of those in the power of the\r\nenemy. I must, therefore, pray you to put into motions, any such means\r\nyou have, for obtaining knowledge of the situation of the Virginia\r\nofficers in captivity. If you should think proper, as I could wish, to\r\ntake upon yourself to retaliate any new sufferings which may be imposed\r\non them, it will be more likely to have due weight, and to restore\r\nthe unhappy on both sides, to that benevolent treatment for which all\r\nshould wish.\r\n\r\n                    I have the honor to be, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                        WILLIAMSBURG, December 10, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of putting under cover to your Excellency,\r\nsome letters to Generals Phillips and Reidezel, uninformed whether they\r\nare gone into New York or not, and knowing that you can best forward\r\nthem in either case.\r\n\r\nI also trouble you with a letter from the master of the flag in this\r\nState, to the British commissary of prisoners in New York, trusting it\r\nwill thus be more certainly conveyed than if sent to Mr. Adams. It is\r\nmy wish that the British commissary should return his answer through\r\nyour Excellency, or your commissary of prisoners, and that they should\r\nnot propose, under this pretext, to send another flag, as the mission\r\nof the present flag is not unattended with circumstances of suspicion;\r\nand a certain information of the situation of ourselves and our allies\r\nhere, might influence the measures of the enemy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your commissary of prisoners can effect the former method of\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nI enclose to you part of an Act of Assembly ascertaining the quantity\r\nof land which shall be allowed to the officers and soldiers at the\r\nclose of the war, and providing means of keeping that country vacant\r\nwhich has been allotted for them.\r\n\r\nI am advised to ask your Excellency's attention to the case of Colonel\r\nBland, late commander of the barracks in Albemarle. When that gentleman\r\nwas appointed to that command, he attended the Executive here, and\r\ninformed them, he must either decline it, or be supported in such a\r\nway as would keep up that respect which was essential to his command;\r\nwithout, at the same time, ruining his private fortune.\r\n\r\nThe Executive were sensible he would be exposed to great and\r\nunavoidable expense: they observed, his command would be in a\r\ndepartment separate from any other, and that he actually relieved a\r\nMajor General from the same service. They did not think themselves\r\nauthorized to say what should be done in this case, but undertook to\r\nrepresent the matter to Congress, and, in the meantime, gave it as\r\ntheir opinion that he ought to be allowed a decent table. On this he\r\nundertook the office, and in the course of it incurred expenses which\r\nseemed to have been unavoidable, unless he would have lived in such\r\na way as is hardly reconcilable to the spirit of an officer, or the\r\nreputation of those in whose service he is. Governor Henry wrote on the\r\nsubject to Congress; Colonel Bland did the same; but we learn they have\r\nconcluded the allowance to be unprecedented, and inadmissible in the\r\ncase of an officer of his rank. The commissaries, on this, have called\r\non Colonel Bland for reimbursement. A sale of his estate was about to\r\ntake place, when we undertook to recommend to them to suspend their\r\ndemand, till we could ask the favor of you to advocate this matter so\r\nfar with Congress, as you may think it right; otherwise the ruin of a\r\nvery worthy officer must inevitably follow.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem,\r\n\r\n                Your Excellency's most obedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                        WILLIAMSBURG, February 10, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--It is possible you may have heard, that in the course of last\r\nsummer an expedition was meditated, by our Colonel Clarke, against\r\nDetroit: that he had proceeded so far as to rendezvous a considerable\r\nbody of Indians, I believe four or five thousand, at St. Vincennes;\r\nbut, being disappointed in the number of whites he expected, and not\r\nchoosing to rely principally on the Indians, he was obliged to decline\r\nit. We have a tolerable prospect of reinforcing him this spring, to the\r\nnumber which he thinks sufficient for the enterprise. We have informed\r\nhim of this, and left him to decide between this object, and that of\r\ngiving vigorous chastisement to those tribes of Indians, whose eternal\r\nhostilities have proved them incapable of living on friendly terms\r\nwith us. It is our opinion, his inclination will lead him to determine\r\non the former. The reason of my laying before your Excellency this\r\nmatter, is, that it has been intimated to me that Colonel Broadhead\r\nis meditating a similar expedition. I wished, therefore, to make you\r\nacquainted with what we had in contemplation. The enterprising and\r\nenergetic genius of Clarke is not altogether unknown to you. You also\r\nknow (what I am a stranger to) the abilities of Broadhead, and the\r\nparticular force with which you will be able to arm him for such an\r\nexpedition. We wish the most hopeful means should be used for removing\r\nso uneasy a thorn from our side. As yourself, alone, are acquainted\r\nwith all the circumstances necessary for well-informed decision, I am\r\nto ask the favor of your Excellency, if you should think Broadhead's\r\nundertaking it most likely to produce success, that you will be so\r\nkind as to intimate to us to divert Clarke to the other object, which\r\nis also important to this State. It will, of course, have weight with\r\nyou, in forming your determination, that our prospect of strengthening\r\nClarke's hands, sufficiently, is not absolutely certain. It may be\r\nnecessary, perhaps, to inform you, that these two officers cannot\r\nact together, which excludes the hopes of ensuring success by a joint\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most sincere esteem, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DE RIEDESEL.[87]\r\n\r\n                                                  RICHMOND, May 3, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your several favors of December 4th, February 10th, and March\r\n30th, are come duly to hand. I sincerely condole with Madame de\r\nRiedesel on the birth of a _daughter_, but receive great pleasure from\r\nthe information of her recovery, as every circumstance of felicity to\r\nher, yourself or family, is interesting to us. The little attentions\r\nyou are pleased to magnify so much, never deserved a mention or\r\nthought. My mortification was that the peculiar situation in which\r\nwe were, put it out of our power to render your stay here more\r\ncomfortable. I am sorry to learn that the negotiations for the exchange\r\nof prisoners have proved abortive, as well from a desire to see the\r\nnecessary distresses of war alleviated in every possible instance, as\r\nthat I am sensible how far yourself and family are interested in it.\r\nAgainst this, however, is to be weighed the possibility that we may\r\nagain have a pleasure we should otherwise, perhaps, never have had;\r\nthat of seeing you again. Be this as it may, opposed as we happen\r\nto be in our sentiments of duty and honor, and anxious for contrary\r\nevents, I shall, nevertheless, sincerely rejoice in every circumstance\r\nof happiness or safety, which may attend you personally; and when a\r\ntermination of the present contest shall put it in my power to declare\r\nto you more unreservedly, how sincere are the sentiments of esteem and\r\nrespect (wherein Mrs. Jefferson joins me) which I entertain for Madame\r\nde Riedesel and yourself, and with which I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n              Your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                RICHMOND, June 11, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Major Galvan, as recommended by your Excellency, was dispatched\r\nto his station without delay, and has been furnished with everything he\r\ndesired, as far as we were able. The line of expresses formed between\r\nus, is such as will communicate intelligence from one to the other\r\nin twenty-three hours. I have forwarded to him information of our\r\ndisasters in the South, as they have come to me.\r\n\r\nOur intelligence from the southward is most lamentably defective.\r\nThough Charleston has been in the hands of the enemy a month, we\r\nhear nothing of their movements which can be relied on. Rumors\r\nare, that they are penetrating northward. To remedy this defect, I\r\nshall immediately establish a line of expresses from hence to the\r\nneighborhood of their army, and send thither a sensible, judicious\r\nperson, to give us information of their movements. This intelligence\r\nwill, I hope, be conveyed to us at the rate of one hundred and\r\ntwenty miles in the twenty-four hours. They set out to their\r\nstations to-morrow. I wish it were possible, that a like speedy line\r\nof communication could be formed from hence to your Excellency's\r\nhead-quarters. Perfect and speedy information of what is passing in the\r\nSouth, might put it in your power, perhaps, to frame your measures by\r\ntheirs. There is really nothing to oppose the progress of the enemy,\r\nnorthward, but the cautious principles of the military art. North\r\nCarolina is without arms. We do not abound. Those we have, are freely\r\nimparted to them, but such is the state of their resources, that they\r\nhave not been able to move a single musket from this State to theirs.\r\nAll the wagons we can collect, have been furnished to the Marquis de\r\nKalb, and are assembled for the march of twenty-five hundred men, under\r\nGeneral Stevens, of Culpeper, who will move on the 10th instant. I have\r\nwritten to Congress to hasten supplies of arms and military stores for\r\nthe Southern States, and particularly to aid us with cartridge-paper\r\nand boxes, the want of which articles, small as they are, renders\r\nour stores useless. The want of money cramps every effort. This will\r\nbe supplied by the most unpalatable of all substitutes, force. Your\r\nExcellency will readily conceive, that, after the loss of one army,\r\nour eyes are turned towards the other, and that we comfort ourselves,\r\nif any aids can be furnished by you, without defeating the operations\r\nmore beneficial to the general union, they will be furnished. At the\r\nsame time, I am happy to find that the wishes of the people go no\r\nfurther, as far as I have an opportunity of learning their sentiments.\r\nCould arms be furnished, I think this State and North Carolina would\r\nembody from ten to fifteen thousand militia, immediately, and more if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nI hope, ere long, to be able to give you a more certain statement of\r\nthe enemy's as well as our situation, which I shall not fail to do.\r\nI enclose you a letter from Major Galvan, being the second I have\r\nforwarded to you.\r\n\r\nWith sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, I have the\r\nhonor to be your Excellency's\r\n\r\n                     Most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                 RICHMOND, July 2, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have received from the Committee of Congress, at head-quarters,\r\nthree letters calling for aids of men and provisions. I beg leave\r\nto refer you to my letter to them, of this date, on those subjects.\r\nI thought it necessary, however, to suggest to you the preparing an\r\narrangement of officers for the men; for, though they are to supply our\r\nbattalions, yet, as our whole line officers, almost, are in captivity,\r\nI suppose some temporary provision must be made. We cheerfully transfer\r\nto you every power which the Executive might exercise on this occasion.\r\nAs it is possible you may cast your eye on the unemployed officers now\r\nwithin the State, I write to General Muhlenburg, to send you a return\r\nof them. I think the men will be rendezvoused within the present month.\r\nThe bill, indeed, for raising them is not actually passed, but it is in\r\nits last stage, and no opposition to any essential parts of it. I will\r\ntake care to notify you of its passage.\r\n\r\nI have, with great pain, perceived your situation; and, the more\r\nso, as, being situated between two fires, a division of sentiment\r\nhas arisen, both in Congress and here, as to which the resources of\r\nthis country should be sent. The removal of General Clinton to the\r\nnorthward, must, of course, have great influence on the determination\r\nof this question; and I have no doubt but considerable aids may be\r\ndrawn hence, for your army, unless a larger one should be embodied\r\nin the South, than the force of the enemy there seems to call for. I\r\nhave the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect and esteem, your\r\nExcellency's\r\n\r\n                   Most obedient humble servant.[88]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL EDWARD STEVENS.\r\n\r\n                                               RICHMOND, August 4, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your several favors of July the 16th, 21st, and 22d, are now\r\nbefore me. Our smiths are engaged in making five hundred axes and some\r\ntomahawks for General Gates. About one hundred of these will go by the\r\nwagons now taking in their loads. As these are for the army in general,\r\nno doubt but you will participate of them. A chest of medicine was made\r\nup for you in Williamsburg, and by a strange kind of forgetfulness,\r\nthe vessel ordered to bring that, left it and brought the rest of the\r\nshop. It is sent for again, and I am not without hopes will be here\r\nin time to go by the present wagons. They will carry some ammunition\r\nand the axes, and will make up their load with spirits. Tents, I fear,\r\ncannot be got in this country; we have, however, sent out powers to all\r\nthe trading towns here, to take it wherever they can find it. I write\r\nto General Gates, to try whether the duck in North Carolina cannot\r\nbe procured by the Executive of that State on Continental account;\r\nfor, surely, the whole army, as well our militia as the rest, is\r\nContinental. The arms you have to spare may be delivered to General\r\nGates's order, taking and furnishing us with proper vouchers. We shall\r\nendeavor to send our drafts armed. I cannot conceive how the arms\r\nbefore sent could have got into so very bad order; they certainly went\r\nfrom hence in good condition. You wish to know how far the property of\r\nthis State, in your hands, is meant to be subject to the orders of the\r\nCommander-in-chief. Arms and military stores, we mean to be perfectly\r\nsubject to him. The provisions going from this country will be for\r\nthe whole army. If we can get any tents, they must be appropriated to\r\nthe use of our own troops. Medicine, sick stores, spirits and such\r\nthings, we expect shall be on the same footing as with the northern\r\narmy. There, you know, each State furnishes its own troops with these\r\narticles, and, of course, has an exclusive right to what is furnished.\r\nThe money put into your hands, was meant as a particular resource for\r\nany extra wants of our own troops, yet, in case of great distress, you\r\nwould probably not see the others suffer without communicating part of\r\nit for their use. We debit Congress with this whole sum. There can be\r\nnothing but what is right in your paying Major Mazaret's troops out of\r\nit. I wish the plan you have adopted for securing a return of the arms\r\nfrom the militia, may answer. I apprehend any man who has a good gun on\r\nhis shoulder, would agree to keep it, and have the worth of it deducted\r\nout of his pay, more especially, when the receipt of the pay is at some\r\ndistance. What would you think of notifying to them, further, that a\r\nproper certificate that they are discharged, and have _returned their\r\narms_, will be required before any pay is issued to them. A roll, kept\r\nand forwarded, of those so discharged, and who have delivered up their\r\narms, would supply accidental losses of their certificates. We are\r\nendeavoring to get bayonet belts made. The State quarter-master affirms\r\nthe cartouch boxes sent from this place (nine hundred and fifty-nine\r\nin number), were all in good condition. I therefore suppose the three\r\nhundred you received in such very bad order, must have gone from\r\nthe Continental quarter-master at Petersburg, or, perhaps, have been\r\npillaged, on the road, of their flaps, to mend shoes, &c. I must still\r\npress the return of as many wagons as possible. All you will send,\r\nshall be loaded with spirits, or something else for the army. By their\r\nnext return, we shall have a good deal of bacon collected. The enclosed\r\nis a copy of what was reported to me, as heretofore sent by the wagons.\r\nI am, Sir, with the greatest esteem,\r\n\r\n                   Your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.[89]\r\n\r\n                                               RICHMOND, August 4, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your several favors of July 19, 21, and 22, are now before me.\r\nI have enquired into the state of the cartouch boxes which were sent\r\nfrom our magazine. The Quartermaster assures me they were in very\r\ngood order. I must, therefore, conclude, that the 300 complained of\r\nby General Stevens, were some sent from Petersburg by the Continental\r\nQuartermaster, or that they were pillaged of the leather on the way,\r\nto mend shoes, &c. We had hopes of getting 2,000 from the Board of\r\nWar, but we got only about 600, and they are said to be unfit for use.\r\nWe are engaged in making bayonet belts, which shall be forwarded, but\r\nit is extremely difficult to procure leather. The consumption of beef\r\nby your army will, I hope, remove the want of this article another\r\nyear. I have ordered the 500 axes you desired, with some tomahawks,\r\nto be made. They turn out about 20 a day. About 100 will go on by the\r\nwagons General Stevens sent us, which are now loading at this place.\r\nThese wagons will carry some ammunition and spirit. A vessel with about\r\n3,000 stand of arms, coming down the bay for the use of your army, was\r\ndriven by privateers into Wicomico. We are endeavoring to get them\r\nforwarded either by land or water. The want of wagons will greatly\r\nretard them. What is to be done for tents, I know not. I am assured\r\nthat very little duck can be got in this country. Whatever there is,\r\nhowever, will be produced under a commission gone out for that purpose.\r\nThe duck you speak of as being in North Carolina, cannot be procured\r\nby that State, on Continental account, for the use of the army. I\r\ncommunicated your orders to Colonel Finnie, and to Colonel Buford, and\r\nhave directed proper applications for the repairs of the bridges, &c.,\r\nyou mention. Arms are ready for Buford's, Davies's, and Gibson's men.\r\nGibson's men are clothed, and wait only to be paid, which will be done\r\nwithin the course of a week. Clothing has been issued some time for\r\nthe others, which is making up under the superintendence of Colonel\r\nDavies. They are utterly destitute of blankets, and I fear we shall\r\nbe unable to get any. Brent's infantry are but 30, and cannot be sent\r\non without bringing on disagreeable disputes about rank between his\r\nofficers and Gibson's. To silence these, the march of his men has been\r\ncountermanded. Colonel Finnie informs me, that Major Lee's infantry\r\nhas been sent back by special orders. We have ordered 243 horses to be\r\npurchased for Colonels White and Washington. The orders to Mr. Lewis\r\nto purchase beef in Carolina were given by the Continental Commissary,\r\nso long ago as last winter, when it was not foreseen there would be\r\nsuch a call for it in that country. Having no other means of conveying\r\na letter to him, I take the liberty of putting one under cover to\r\nyou, with instructions to him to discontinue his purchases in North\r\nCarolina, and to furnish you with so much of the beef he has, as you\r\nmay think necessary. It would be expedient for you to leave in his\r\nhands whatever quantity is not absolutely necessary for your army; as,\r\ndepending on that, no other provision has been made for the post at\r\nCharlottesville, and you know our country so well as to foresee that\r\na port, at which 5,000 rations a day are issued, cannot be fed by the\r\npurchase of the day.\r\n\r\nWe have reason to believe the French fleet arrived at Newport the 10th\r\nult., but it is not certain. Admiral Graves, with six sail of the line,\r\nis certainly arrived at New York.\r\n\r\n        I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir,\r\n              Your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR-GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                              RICHMOND, August 15, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of August the 3d, is just now put into my hand. Those\r\nformerly received have been duly answered, and my replies will, no\r\ndoubt, have reached you before this date. My last letter to you was by\r\nColonel Drayton.\r\n\r\nI spoke fully with you on the difficulty of procuring wagons here,\r\nwhen I had the pleasure of seeing you, and for that reason pressed\r\nthe sending back as many as possible. One brigade of twelve has since\r\nreturned, and is again on its way with medicine, military stores,\r\nand spirit. Any others which come, and as fast as they come, shall\r\nbe returned to you with spirit and bacon. I have ever been informed,\r\nthat the very plentiful harvests of North Carolina, would render the\r\ntransportation of flour from this State as unnecessary as it would\r\nbe tedious, and that, in this point of view, the wagons should carry\r\nhence only the articles before mentioned, which are equally wanting\r\nwith you. Finding that no great number of wagons is likely to return\r\nto us, we will immediately order as many more to be bought and sent\r\non, as we possibly can. But, to prevent too great expectations, I must\r\nagain repeat, that I fear no great number can be got. I do assure you,\r\nhowever, that neither attention nor expense shall be spared, to forward\r\nto you every support for which we can obtain means of transportation.\r\nYou have, probably, received our order on Colonel Lewis, to deliver you\r\nany of the beeves he may have purchased.\r\n\r\nTents, I fear, it is in vain to expect, because there is not in\r\nthis country stuff to make them. We have agents and commissioners in\r\nconstant pursuit of stuff, but hitherto researches have been fruitless.\r\nYour order to Colonel Carrington shall be immediately communicated. A\r\nhundred copies of the proclamation shall also be immediately printed\r\nand forwarded to you. General Muhlenburg is come to this place, which\r\nhe will now make his head-quarters. I think he will be able to set\r\ninto motion, within a very few days, five hundred regulars, who are\r\nnow equipped for their march, except some blankets still wanting, but\r\nI hope nearly procured and ready to be delivered.\r\n\r\nI sincerely congratulate you on your successful advances on the\r\nenemy, and wish to do everything to second your enterprises, which the\r\nsituation of this country, and the means and powers put into my hands,\r\nenable me to do.\r\n\r\n              I am, Sir, with sincere respect and esteem,\r\n                  Your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, September 3, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--As I know the anxieties you must have felt, since the late\r\nmisfortune to the South, and our latter accounts have not been quite so\r\nfavorable as the first, I take the liberty of enclosing you a statement\r\nof this unlucky affair, taken from letters from General Gates, General\r\nStevens, and Governor Nash, and, as to some circumstances, from an\r\nofficer who was in the action.[90] Another army is collecting; this\r\namounted, on the 23d ultimo, to between four and five thousand men,\r\nconsisting of about five hundred Maryland regulars, a few of Hamilton's\r\nartillery, and Portersfield corps, Armand's legion, such of the\r\nVirginia militia as had been reclaimed, and about three thousand North\r\nCarolina militia, newly embodied. We are told they will increase these\r\nto eight thousand. Our new recruits will rendezvous in this State\r\nbetween the 10th and 25th instant. We are calling out two thousand\r\nmilitia, who, I think, however, will not be got to Hillsborough till\r\nthe 25th of October. About three hundred and fifty regulars marched\r\nfrom Chesterfield a week ago. Fifty march to-morrow, and there will be\r\none hundred or one hundred and fifty more from that post, when they\r\ncan be cleared of the hospital. This is as good a view as I can give\r\nyou of the force we are endeavoring to collect; but they are unarmed.\r\nAlmost the whole small arms seems to have been lost in the late rout.\r\nThere are here, on their way southward, three thousand stand of arms,\r\nsent by Congress, and we have still a few in our magazine. I have\r\nwritten pressingly, as the subject well deserves, to Congress, to\r\nsend immediate supplies, and to think of forming a magazine here, that\r\nin case of another disaster, we may not be left without all means of\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nI enclosed to your Excellency, some time ago, a resolution of the\r\nAssembly, instructing us to send a quantity of tobacco to New York\r\nfor the relief of our officers there, and asking the favor of you to\r\nobtain permission. Having received no answer, I fear my letter or your\r\nanswer has miscarried. I therefore take the liberty of repeating my\r\napplication to you.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most profound respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD STEVENS.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, September 3, 1780.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I sincerely condole with you on our late misfortune,[91]\r\nwhich sits the heavier on my mind as being produced by my own\r\ncountrymen. Instead of considering what is past, however, we are to\r\nlook forward and prepare for the future. I write General Gates and\r\nGovernor Nash as to supplies and reinforcements. Another body of\r\n2,000 militia are ordered to you to rendezvous at Hillsborough, on\r\nthe 25th of October. They come from the middle and north counties,\r\nbeyond and adjoining the Blue Ridge. I am told, also, that a spirit\r\nof raising volunteers is springing up. The truth of this, however, is\r\nnot certainly known, nor can its success be depended on. Governor Nash\r\nwrites me that 400 wagons were lost. An officer here, however, thinks\r\nthey are not. This, indeed, would be a heavy loss, as well as that of\r\nthe small arms. We shall exert every nerve to assist you in every way\r\nin our power, being, as we are, without any money in the Treasury, or\r\nany prospect of more till the Assembly meets in October.\r\n\r\nI am with great esteem your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. MAJOR GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                           RICHMOND, September 11, 1780.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your bill for £54,712 in favor of Mallette, has been duly\r\nhonored, that for £95,288 we shall also discharge; another bill (which\r\nbeing delivered back to be presented at the end of the ten days, I\r\ncannot recollect either the name of the holder or the sum) has been\r\naccepted. We are now without one shilling in the treasury, or a\r\npossibility of having it recruited till the meeting of the Assembly,\r\nwhich takes place on the 15th of the next month. In this condition\r\nMr. Duncan Ochiltree found us when he delivered your letter of the 5th\r\ninstant, and draught for £100,000 in favor of Col. Polk. The only thing\r\nin our power, after stating to him our situation, was to assure him\r\nthat it should be paid as soon as we should be enabled to do it by the\r\nAssembly, which I flatter myself will be as soon as they meet. Of this\r\nI am to notify him, that he may know when to call for payment. I shall\r\nbe very glad if you can accommodate, to the same circumstances, any\r\nother draughts you may find it necessary to make on me.\r\n\r\nWe have sent a Mr. Paton, Commissary for the State, to collect beeves\r\nin our southern counties, and forward them to your army. He has orders\r\nto keep up a proper correspondence with your Commissary.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be with the greatest esteem and respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL EDWARD STEVENS.\r\n\r\n                                           RICHMOND, September 12, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letters of August 27th and 30th are now before me. The\r\nsubsequent desertions of your militia have taken away the necessity of\r\nanswering the question, How they shall be armed? On the contrary, as\r\nthere must now be a surplus of arms, I am in hopes you will endeavor\r\nto reserve them, as we have not here a sufficient number by fifteen\r\nhundred or two thousand for the men who will march hence, if they\r\nmarch in numbers equal to our expectations. I have sent expresses\r\ninto all the counties from which those militia went, requiring the\r\ncounty lieutenants to exert themselves in taking them; and such is the\r\ndetestation with which they have been received, that I have heard from\r\nmany counties they were going back of themselves. You will, of course,\r\nhold courts martial on them, and make them soldiers for eight months.\r\nIf you will be so good as to inform me, from time to time, how many you\r\nhave, we may, perhaps, get the supernumerary officers in the State to\r\ntake command of them. By the same opportunities, I desired notice to\r\nbe given to the friends of the few remaining with you, that they had\r\nlost their clothes and blankets, and recommended that they should avail\r\nthemselves of any good opportunity to send them supplies.\r\n\r\nWe approve of your accommodating the hospital with medicines, and\r\nthe Maryland troops with spirits. They really deserve the whole, and\r\nI wish we had means of transportation for much greater quantities,\r\nwhich we have on hand and cannot convey. This article we could furnish\r\nplentifully to you and them. What is to be done for wagons, I do not\r\nknow. We have not now one shilling in the treasury to purchase them.\r\nWe have ordered an active quarter-master to go to the westward, and\r\nendeavor to purchase on credit, or impress a hundred wagons and teams.\r\nBut I really see no prospect of sending you additional supplies, till\r\nthe same wagons return from you, which we sent on with the last. I\r\ninformed you, in my last letter, we had ordered two thousand militia\r\nmore, to rendezvous at Hillsborough on the 25th of October. You will\r\njudge yourself, whether, in the meantime, you can be more useful by\r\nremaining where you are, with the few militia left and coming in, or by\r\nreturning home, where, besides again accommodating yourself after your\r\nlosses, you may also aid us in getting those men into motion, and in\r\npointing out such things as are within our power, and may be useful to\r\nthe service. And you will act accordingly. I am, with great friendship\r\nand esteem, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n                  Your most obedient, humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL EDWARD STEVENS.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, Sept. 15th, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I beg leave to trouble you with a private letter, on a little\r\nmatter of my own, having no acquaintance at camp, with whom I can take\r\nthat liberty. Among the wagons impressed, for the use of your militia,\r\nwere two of mine. One of these, I know is safe, having been on its\r\nway from hence to Hillsborough, at the time of the late engagement.\r\nThe other, I have reason to believe, was on the field. A wagon master,\r\nwho says he was near it, informs me the brigade quarter-master cut out\r\none of my best horses, and made his escape on him, and that he saw my\r\nwagoner loosening his own horse to come off, but the enemy's horse were\r\nthen coming up, and he knows nothing further. He was a negro man, named\r\nPhill, lame in one arm and leg. If you will do me the favor to enquire\r\nwhat has become of him, what horses are saved, and to send them to me,\r\nI shall be much obliged to you. The horses were not public property,\r\nas they were only impressed and not sold. Perhaps your certificate of\r\nwhat is lost, may be necessary for me. The wagon master told me, that\r\nthe public money was in my wagon, a circumstance which, perhaps, may\r\naid your enquiries. After apologising for the trouble, I beg leave to\r\nassure you that I am, with great sincerity,\r\n\r\n                        Your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                           RICHMOND, September 23, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have empowered Colonel Carrington to have twelve boats, scows\r\nor batteaux, built at Taylor's Ferry, and to draw on me for the cost. I\r\nrecommended the constructing them so as to answer the transportation of\r\nprovisions along that river, as a change of position of the two armies,\r\nmay render them unnecessary at Taylor's ferry; and I am thoroughly\r\npersuaded, that, unless we can find out some channel of transportation\r\nby water, no supplies of bread, of any consequence, can be sent you\r\nfrom this State for a long time to come. The want of wagons is a bar\r\ninsuperable, at least, in any reasonable time. I have given orders\r\nto have Fry and Jefferson's map, and Henry's map of Virginia, sought\r\nfor and purchased. As soon as they can be got, I will forward them. I\r\nhave also written to General Washington on the subject of wintering\r\nthe French fleet in the Chesapeake. Our new levies rendezvous in\r\nlarge numbers. As General Washington had constituted them into eight\r\nbattalions, and allotted none to Colonel Harrison, we think to deliver\r\nhim about four hundred drafts of another kind, who are to serve\r\neighteen months also. Unless Congress furnish small arms, we cannot\r\narm more than half the men who will go from this State. The prize you\r\nmention of tents and blankets is very fortunate. It is absolutely out\r\nof our power to get these articles, to any amount, in this country,\r\nnor have we clothing for our new levies. They must, therefore, go\r\nto you clothed as militia, till we can procure and send on supplies.\r\nThey will be as warm in their present clothing at Hillsborough, as at\r\nChesterfield Court House.\r\n\r\nWe have an agent, collecting all the beeves which can be got from the\r\ncounties round about Portsmouth, to send off to you. They have there\r\nalso plentiful crops of corn growing. We have instructed him to try\r\nwhether means of conveying it down into the Sounds, and up some of the\r\nrivers of North Carolina, or by land to Meherrin river, and thence down\r\nChowan, and up Roanoke, cannot be rendered practicable.\r\n\r\nI am, with every sentiment of esteem and respect, your most obedient\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. I enclose a certificate, acknowledging satisfaction for the money\r\nfurnished by Colonel Kosciusko.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                           RICHMOND, September 23, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I yesterday forwarded to you a letter from Colonel Wood,\r\ninforming you of his situation. That post has, for some time past,\r\nbeen pretty regularly supplied, and I hope will continue to be for some\r\ntime to come. A person, whose punctuality can be relied on, offers to\r\ncontract for victualling it. If we can agree on terms, and the Assembly\r\nwill strengthen our hands sufficiently, we think to adopt that method,\r\nas the only one to be relied on with certainty. I have heard it hinted\r\nthat Colonel Wood thinks of quitting that post. I should be exceedingly\r\nsorry, indeed, were he to do it. He has given to those under his charge\r\nthe most perfect satisfaction, and, at the same time, used all the\r\ncautions which the nature of his charge has required. It is principally\r\nowing to his prudence and good temper, that the late difficulties have\r\nbeen passed over, almost without a murmur. Any influence which your\r\nExcellency shall think proper to use, for retaining him in his present\r\nsituation, will promote the public good, and have a great tendency to\r\nkeep up a desirable harmony with the officers of that corps. Our new\r\nrecruits are rendezvousing very generally. Colonel Harrison was uneasy\r\nat having none of them assigned to his corps of artillery, who have\r\nvery much distinguished themselves in the late unfortunate action,\r\nand are reduced almost to nothing. We happened to have about four\r\nhundred drafts, raised in the last year, and never called out and sent\r\non duty by their county lieutenants, whom we have collected and are\r\ncollecting. We think to deliver these to Colonel Harrison: they are\r\nto serve eighteen months from the time of rendezvous. The numbers of\r\nregulars and militia ordered from this State into the southern service,\r\nare about seven thousand. I trust we may count that fifty-five hundred\r\nwill actually proceed; but we have arms for three thousand only. If,\r\ntherefore, we do not speedily receive a supply from Congress, we must\r\ncountermand a proper number of these troops. Besides this supply,\r\nthere should certainly be a magazine laid in here, to provide against a\r\ngeneral loss as well as daily waste. When we deliver out those now in\r\nour magazine, we shall have sent seven thousand stand of our own into\r\nthe southern service, in the course of this summer. We are still more\r\ndestitute of clothing, tents and wagons for our troops. The southern\r\narmy suffers for provisions, which we could plentifully supply, were\r\nit possible to find means of transportation. Despairing of this, we\r\ndirected very considerable quantities, collected on the navigable\r\nwaters, to be sent northwardly by the quarter-master. This he is now\r\ndoing; slowly, however. Unapprised what may be proposed by our allies,\r\nto be done with their fleet in the course of the ensuing winter, I\r\nwould beg leave to intimate to you, that if it should appear to them\r\neligible that it should winter in the Chesapeake, they can be well\r\nsupplied with provisions, taking their necessary measures in due time.\r\nThe waters communicating with that bay furnish easy, and (in that case)\r\nsafe transportation, and their money will call forth what is denied to\r\nours.\r\n\r\nI am, with all possible esteem and respect, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                           RICHMOND, September 26, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The enclosed copy of a letter from Lord Cornwallis[92] to Colonel\r\nBalfour, was sent me by Governor Rutledge: lest you should not have\r\nseen it, I do myself the pleasure of transmitting it, with a letter\r\nfrom General Harrington to General Gates giving information of some\r\nlate movements of the enemy.\r\n\r\nI was honored yesterday with your favor of the 5th instant, on the\r\nsubject of prisoners, and particularly Lieutenant Governor Hamilton.\r\nYou are not unapprised of the influence of this officer with the\r\nIndians, his activity and embittered zeal against us. You also,\r\nperhaps, know how precarious is our tenure of the Illinois country, and\r\nhow critical is the situation of the new counties on the Ohio. These\r\ncircumstances determined us to detain Governor Hamilton and Major Hay\r\nwithin our power, when we delivered up the other prisoners. On a late\r\nrepresentation from the people of Kentucky, by a person sent here from\r\nthat country, and expressions of what they had reason to apprehend\r\nfrom these two prisoners, in the event of their liberation, we assured\r\nthem they would not be parted with, though we were giving up our other\r\nprisoners. Lieutenant Colonel Dabusson, aid to Baron de Kalb, lately\r\ncame here on his parole, with an offer from Lord Rawdon, to exchange\r\nhim for Hamilton. Colonel Towles is now here with a like proposition\r\nfor himself, from General Phillips, very strongly urged by the General.\r\nThese, and other overtures, do not lessen our opinion of the importance\r\nof retaining him; and they have been, and will be, uniformly rejected.\r\nShould the settlement, indeed, of a cartel become impracticable,\r\nwithout the consent of the States to submit their separate prisoners\r\nto its obligation, we will give up these two prisoners, as we would\r\nanything, rather than be an obstacle to a general good. But no\r\nother circumstance would, I believe, extract them from us. These two\r\ngentlemen, with a Lieutenant Colonel Elligood, are the only separate\r\nprisoners we have retained, and the last, only on his own request, and\r\nnot because we set any store by him. There is, indeed, a Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Rocheblawe of Kaskaskie, who has broken his parole, and gone\r\nto New York, whom we must shortly trouble your Excellency to demand for\r\nus, as soon as we can forward to you the proper documents. Since the\r\nforty prisoners sent to Winchester, as mentioned in my letter of the\r\n9th ultimo, about one hundred and fifty more have been sent thither,\r\nsome of them taken by us at sea, others sent on by General Gates.\r\n\r\nThe exposed and weak state of our western settlements, and the danger\r\nto which they are subject from the northern Indians, acting under the\r\ninfluence of the British post at Detroit, render it necessary for us\r\nto keep from five to eight hundred men on duty, for their defence.\r\nThis is a great and perpetual expense. Could that post be reduced and\r\nretained, it would cover all the States to the southeast of it. We have\r\nlong meditated the attempt under the direction of Colonel Clarke, but\r\nthe expense would be so great, that whenever we have wished to take\r\nit up, the circumstance has obliged us to decline it. Two different\r\nestimates make it amount to two millions of pounds, present money. We\r\ncould furnish the men, provisions, and every necessary, except powder,\r\nhad we the money, or could the demand from us be so far supplied from\r\nother quarters, as to leave it in our power to apply such a sum to\r\nthat purpose; and, when once done, it would save annual expenditures\r\nto a great amount. When I speak of furnishing the men, I mean they\r\nshould be militia, such being the popularity of Colonel Clarke, and\r\nthe confidence of the western people in him, that he could raise the\r\nrequisite number at any time. We, therefore, beg leave to refer this\r\nmatter to yourself, to determine whether such an enterprise would not\r\nbe for the general good, and if you think it would, to authorize it\r\nat the general expense. This is become the more reasonable, if, as I\r\nunderstand, the ratification of the Confederation has been rested on\r\nour cession of a part of our western claim; a cession which (speaking\r\nmy private opinion) I verily believe will be agreed to, if the quantity\r\ndemanded is not unreasonably great. Should this proposition be approved\r\nof, it should be immediately made known to us, as the season is now\r\ncoming on, at which some of the preparations must be made. The time of\r\nexecution, I think, should be at the time of the breaking up of the ice\r\nin the Wabash, and before the lakes open. The interval, I am told, is\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, &c., your most obedient and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR-GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                              RICHMOND, October 4, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My letter of September 23d, answered your favors received before\r\nthat date, and the present serves to acknowledge the receipt of those\r\nof September 24th and 27th. I retain in mind, and recur, almost daily,\r\nto your requisitions of August; we have, as yet, no prospect of more\r\nthan one hundred tents. Flour is ordered to be manufactured, as soon as\r\nthe season will render it safe; out of which, I trust, we can furnish\r\nnot only your requisition of August, but that of Congress of September\r\n11th. The corn you desire, we could furnish when the new crops come\r\nin, fully, if water transportation can be found; if not, we shall be\r\nable only to send you what lies convenient to the southern boundary,\r\nin which neighborhood the crops have been much abridged by a flood\r\nin Roanoke. We have no rice. Rum and other spirits we can furnish\r\nto a greater amount than you require, as soon as our wagons are in\r\nreadiness, and shall be glad to commute into that article some others\r\nwhich we have not, particularly sugar, coffee and salt. The vinegar is\r\nprovided. Colonel Finnie promised to furnish to Colonel Muter, a list\r\nof the spades, hoes, &c., which could be furnished from the Continental\r\nstores. This list has never yet come to hand. It is believed, the\r\nContinental stores here will fall little short of your requisition,\r\nexcept in the article of axes, which our shops are proceeding on. Your\r\ninformation of September 24th, as to the quality of the axes, has been\r\nnotified to the workmen, and will, I hope, have a proper effect on\r\nthose made hereafter. Application has been made to the courts, to have\r\nthe bridges put in a proper state, which they have promised to do.\r\nWe are endeavoring again to collect wagons. About twenty are nearly\r\nfinished at this place. We employed, about three weeks ago, agents to\r\npurchase, in the western counties, a hundred wagons and teams. Till\r\nthese can be got, it will be impossible to furnish anything from this\r\nplace. I am exceedingly pleased to hear of your regulation for stopping\r\nour wagons at Roanoke. This will put it in our power to repair and\r\nreplace them, to calculate their returns, provide loads, and will be\r\na great encouragement to increase their number, if possible, as their\r\ndeparture hence will no longer produce the idea of a final adieu to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nColonel Senf arrived here the evening before the last. He was employed\r\nyesterday and to-day, in copying some actual and accurate surveys,\r\nwhich we had had made of the country round about Portsmouth, as far\r\nas Cape Henry to the eastward, Nansemond river to the westward, the\r\nDismal Swamp to the southward, and northwardly, the line of country\r\nfrom Portsmouth by Hampton and York, to Williamsburg, and including\r\nthe vicinities of these three last posts. This will leave him nothing\r\nto do, but to take drawings of particular places, and the soundings\r\nof such waters as he thinks material. He will proceed on this business\r\nto-morrow, with a letter to General Nelson, and powers to call for the\r\nattendance of a proper vessel.\r\n\r\nI suppose, that your drafts in favor of the quarter-master, if attended\r\nwith sixty days' grace, may be complied with to a certain amount. We\r\nwill certainly use our best endeavors to answer them. I have only to\r\ndesire that they may be made payable to the quarter-master alone, and\r\nnot to the bearer. This is to prevent the mortification of seeing\r\nan unapprised individual taken in by an assignment of them, as if\r\nthey were _ready money_. Your letter to Colonel Finnie will go to\r\nWilliamsburg immediately. Those to Congress, with a copy of the papers\r\nenclosed to me, went yesterday by express. I will take order as to the\r\nbacon you mention. I fear there is little of it, and that not capable\r\nof being long kept. You are surely not uninformed, that Congress\r\nrequired the greater part of this article to be sent northward,\r\nwhich has been done. I hope, by this time, you receive supplies of\r\nbeeves from our commissary, Mr. Eaton, who was sent, three weeks or a\r\nmonth ago to exhaust of that article the counties below, and in the\r\nneighborhood of Portsmouth; and from thence, was to proceed to the\r\nother counties, in order, as they stood exposed to an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the French West India fleet (which, though not\r\nauthentically communicated, seems supported by so many concurring\r\naccounts from individuals, as to leave scarcely room for doubt), will,\r\nI hope, prevent the enemy from carrying into effect the embarkation\r\nthey had certainly intended from New York, though they are strengthened\r\nby the arrival of Admiral Rodney at that place, with twelve sail of the\r\nline and four frigates, as announced by General Washington to Congress,\r\non the 19th ultimo. The accounts of the additional French fleet are\r\nvaried, from sixteen to nineteen ships of the line, besides frigates.\r\nThe number of the latter has never been mentioned. The extracts of\r\nletters, which you will see in our paper of this day, are from General\r\nWashington, President Huntington and our Delegates in Congress to\r\nme. That from Bladensburg is from a particular acquaintance of mine,\r\nwhose credit cannot be doubted. The distress we are experiencing from\r\nwant of leather to make shoes, is great. I am sure you have thought of\r\npreventing it in future, by the appointment of a commissary of hides,\r\nor some other good regulation for saving and tanning the hides, which\r\nthe consumption of your army will afford.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with all possible esteem and respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, October 15, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am rendered not a little anxious by the paragraph of yours\r\nof the 7th instant, wherein you say, \"It is near a month since I\r\nreceived any letter from your Excellency; indeed, the receipt of most\r\nthat I have written to you remain unacknowledged.\" You ought, within\r\nthat time, to have received my letter of September the 3d, written\r\nimmediately on my return to this place, after a fortnight's absence;\r\nthat of September the 11th, acknowledging the receipt of yours which\r\ncovered drafts for money; that of September the 23d, on the subject of\r\nbatteaux at Taylor's ferry, wagons, maps of Virginia, wintering the\r\nFrench fleet in the Chesapeake, our new levies, and provisions from\r\nour lower counties; and that of October the 4th, in answer to yours\r\nof September the 24th, and 27th. I begin to apprehend treachery in\r\nsome part of our chain of expresses, and beg the favor of you, in your\r\nnext, to mention whether any, and which of these letters have come to\r\nhand. This acknowledges the receipt of yours of September the 28th, and\r\nOctober the 3d, 5th, and 7th. The first of these was delivered four or\r\nfive days ago by Captain Drew. He will be permitted to return as you\r\ndesire, as we would fulfil your wishes in every point in our power,\r\nas well as indulge the ardor of a good officer. Our militia from the\r\nwestern counties, are now on their march to join you. They are fond\r\nof the kind of service in which Colonel Morgan is generally engaged,\r\nand are made very happy by being informed you intend to put them under\r\nhim. Such as pass by this place, take muskets in their hands. Those\r\nfrom the southern counties beyond the Blue Ridge, were advised to\r\ncarry their rifles. For those who carry neither rifles nor muskets, as\r\nwell as for our eighteen months' men, we shall send on arms as soon as\r\nwagons can be procured. In the meantime, I had hoped that there were\r\narms for those who should first arrive at Hillsborough, as by General\r\nStevens's return, dated at his departure thence, there were somewhere\r\nbetween five and eight hundred muskets (I speak from memory, not having\r\npresent access to the return) belonging to this State, either in the\r\nhands of the few militia who were there, or stored. Captain Fauntleroy,\r\nof the cavalry, gives me hopes he shall immediately forward a very\r\nconsiderable supply of accoutrements, for White's and Washington's\r\ncavalry. He told me yesterday, he had received one hundred and thirteen\r\nhorses for that service, from us. Besides those, he had rejected\r\nsixty odd, after we had purchased them, at £30 apiece. Nelson's two\r\ntroops were returned to me, deficient only twelve horses, since which,\r\nten have been sent to him by Lieutenant Armstead. I am not a little\r\ndisappointed, therefore, in the number of cavalry fit for duty, as\r\nmentioned in the letter you enclosed me. Your request (as stated in\r\nyour letter of the 7th) that we will send no men into the field, or\r\neven to your camp, that are not well furnished with shoes, blankets,\r\nand every necessary for immediate service, would amount to a stoppage\r\nof every man; as we have it not in our power to furnish them with real\r\nnecessaries completely. I hope they will be all shod. What proportion\r\nwill have blankets, I cannot say: we purchase every one which can be\r\nfound out; and now I begin to have a prospect of furnishing about half\r\nof them with tents, as soon as they can be made and forwarded. As to\r\nprovisions, our agent, Eaton, of whom I before wrote, informs me in a\r\nletter of the 5th instant, he shall immediately get supplies of beef\r\ninto motion, and shall send some corn by a circuitous navigation. But\r\ntill we receive our wagons from the western country, I cannot hope to\r\naid you in bread. I expect daily to see wagons coming in to us. The\r\nmilitia were ordered to rendezvous at Hillsborough, expecting they\r\nwould thence be ordered by you into service. I send you herewith, a\r\ncopy of Henry's map of Virginia. It is a mere _cento_ of blunders. It\r\nmay serve to give you a general idea of the courses of rivers, and\r\npositions of counties. We are endeavoring to get you a copy of Fry\r\nand Jefferson's; but they are now very scarce. I also enclose you some\r\nnewspapers, in which you will find a detail of Arnold's apostasy and\r\nvillany.\r\n\r\nI am, with all sentiments of sincere respect and esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. Just as I was closing my letter, yours of the 9th instant was\r\nput into my hands. I enclose, by this express, a power to Mr. Lambe,\r\nquarter-master, to impress for a month, ten wagons from each of the\r\ncounties of Brunswick, Mecklenburg, Lunenburg, Charlotte, and Halifax,\r\nand direct him to take your orders, whether they shall go first to you,\r\nor come here. If the latter, we can load them with arms and spirits.\r\nBefore their month is out, I hope the hundred wagons from the westward\r\nwill have come in. We will otherwise provide a relief for these. I am\r\nperfectly astonished at your not having yet received my letters before\r\nmentioned. I send you a copy of that of the 4th of October, as being\r\nmost material. I learn from one of General Muhlenburg's family, that\r\nfive wagons have set out from hence, with three hundred stand of arms,\r\n&c. However, the General writes to you himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, October 22, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have this morning received certain information of the arrival\r\nof a hostile fleet in our bay, of about sixty sail. The debarkation of\r\nsome light horse, in the neighborhood of Portsmouth, seems to indicate\r\nthat as the first scene of action. We are endeavoring to collect as\r\nlarge a body to oppose them as we can arm; this will be lamentably\r\ninadequate, if the enemy be in any force. It is mortifying to suppose\r\nthat a people, able and zealous to contend with their enemy, should\r\nbe reduced to fold their arms for want of the means of defence. Yet\r\nno resources, that we know of, insure us against this event. It has\r\nbecome necessary to divert to this new object, a considerable part\r\nof the aids we had destined for General Gates. We are still, however,\r\nsensible of the necessity of supporting him, and have left that part\r\nof the country nearest him uncalled on, at present, that they may\r\nreinforce him as soon as arms can be received. We have called to the\r\ncommand of our forces Generals Weeden and Muhlenburg, of the line, and\r\nNelson and Stevens of the militia. You will be pleased to make to these\r\nsuch additions as you may think proper. As to the aids of men, I ask\r\nfor none, knowing that if the late detachment of the enemy shall have\r\nleft it safe for you to spare aids of that kind, you will not await my\r\napplication. Of the troops we shall raise, there is not a single man\r\nwho ever saw the face of an enemy. Whether the Convention troops will\r\nbe removed or not, is yet undetermined. This must depend on the force\r\nof the enemy, and the aspect of their movements.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be your Excellency's most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                             IN COUNCIL, Oct. 22d, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The letters which accompany this will inform you of the arrival\r\nof a large fleet of the enemy within our capes, and that they have\r\nbegun their debarkation.[93] We are taking measures to collect a body\r\nto oppose them, for which purpose it seems necessary to retain such\r\nregulars, volunteers and militia as have not yet gone on to you. We\r\nhave left the counties of Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, Halifax, and all\r\nabove them on the south side of James river, uncalled on, that they\r\nmay be in readiness to reinforce you as soon as arms can be procured.\r\nI am in hopes the eighteen months' men and western militia, who will\r\nhave joined you with the volunteers from Washington and Montgomery,\r\nas proposed by Col. Preston, and the eighteen months' militia, will\r\nbe a useful reinforcement to you, and shall continue to divide our\r\nattention, both as to men and provisions, between the army in your\r\nfront and that which is posting itself within our own country.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. Col. Carrington is arrived since writing the above, and says you\r\nwant thirty horses to move your artillery. They shall be immediately\r\nsent to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, October 25, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of enclosing to you letters from Governor\r\nHamilton, for New York. On some representations received by Colonel\r\nTowles, that an indulgence to Governor Hamilton and his companions to\r\ngo to New York, on parole, would produce the happiest effect on the\r\nsituation of our officers in Long Island, we have given him, Major Hay,\r\nand some of the same party at Winchester, leave to go there on parole.\r\nThe two former go by water, the latter by land.\r\n\r\nBy this express I hand on, from General Gates to Congress, intelligence\r\nof the capture of Augusta, in Georgia, with considerable quantities\r\nof goods; and information, which carries a fair appearance, of the\r\ntaking of Georgetown, in South Carolina, by a party of ours, and that\r\nan army of six thousand French and Spaniards had landed at Sunbury.\r\nThis is the more credible, as Cornwallis retreated from Charlotte on\r\nthe 12th instant, with great marks of precipitation. Since my last to\r\nyou, informing you of an enemy's fleet, they have landed eight hundred\r\nmen in the neighborhood of Portsmouth, and some more on the bay side\r\nof Princess Anne. One thousand infantry landed at New-ports-news, on\r\nthe morning of the 23d, and immediately took possession of Hampton. The\r\nhorse were proceeding up the road. Such a corps as Major Lee's would\r\nbe of infinite service to us. Next to a naval force, horse seems to be\r\nmost capable of protecting a country so intersected by waters.\r\n\r\nI am, with the most sincere esteem, your Excellency's most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, October 26, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Executive of this State think it expedient, under our\r\npresent circumstances, that the prisoners of war under the Convention\r\nof Saratoga, be removed from their present situation. It will be\r\nimpossible, as long as they remain with us, to prevent the hostile\r\narmy from being reinforced by numerous desertions from this corps; and\r\nthis expectation may be one among the probable causes of this movement\r\nof the enemy. Should, moreover, a rescue of them be attempted, the\r\nextensive disaffection which has of late been discovered, and the\r\nalmost total want of arms in the hands of our good people, render\r\nthe success of such an enterprise by no means desperate. The fear of\r\nthis, and the dangerous convulsions to which such an attempt would\r\nexpose us, divert the attention of a very considerable part of our\r\nmilitia from an opposition to an invading enemy. An order has been,\r\ntherefore, this day issued to Colonel Wood, to take immediate measures\r\nfor their removal; and every aid has been, and will be given him, for\r\ntransporting, guarding, and subsisting them on the road, which our\r\npowers can accomplish. Notice hereof is sent to his Excellency Governor\r\nLee, on whose part, I doubt not, necessary preparations will be made.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem and respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, October 28, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letters of the 14th, 20th and 21st have come to hand, and\r\nyour despatches to Congress have been regularly forwarded. I shall\r\nattend to the caveat against Mr. Ochiltree's bill. Your letter to\r\nColonel Senf remains still in my hands, as it did not come till the\r\nenemy had taken possession of the ground, on which I knew him to have\r\nbeen, and I have since no certain information where a letter might\r\nsurely find him. My proposition as to your bills in favor of the\r\nquarter-master, referred to yours of September 27th. I have notified to\r\nthe Continental quarter-master, your advance of nine hundred dollars\r\nto Cooper. As yet, we have received no wagons. I wish Mr. Lambe may\r\nhave supplied you. Should those from the western quarter not come in,\r\nwe will authorize him or some other, to procure a relief, in time,\r\nfor those first impressed. We are upon the eve of a new arrangement as\r\nto our commissary's and quarter-master's departments, as the want of\r\nmoney, introducing its substitute force, requires the establishment of\r\na different kind of system.\r\n\r\nSince my first information to you of the arrival of an enemy, they have\r\nlanded about eight hundred men near Portsmouth, some on the bay side of\r\nPrincess Anne, one thousand at Hampton, and still retained considerable\r\npart on board their ships. Those at Hampton, after committing horrid\r\ndepredations, have again retired to their ships, which, on the evening\r\nof the 26th, were strung along the road from New-ports-news, to the\r\nmouth of Nansemond, which seems to indicate an intention of coming\r\nup James river. Our information is, that they have from four to five\r\nthousand men, commanded by General Leslie, and that they have come\r\nunder convoy of one forty-gun ship, and some frigates (how many has\r\nnever been said), commanded by Commodore Rodney. Would it not be worth\r\nwhile to send out a swift boat from some of the inlets of Carolina,\r\nto notify the French Admiral that his enemies are in a net, if he has\r\nleisure to close the mouth of it? Generals Muhlenburg and Nelson are\r\nassembling a force to be ready for them, and General Weeden has come\r\nto this place, where he is at present employed in some arrangements.\r\nWe have ordered the removal of the Saratoga prisoners, that we may have\r\nour hands clear for these new guests.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, November 3, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Since I had the honor of writing to your Excellency, on the 25th\r\nultimo, the enemy have withdrawn their forces from the North of James\r\nRiver, and have taken post at Portsmouth, which, we learn, they are\r\nfortifying. Their highest post is Suffolk, where there is a very narrow\r\nand defensible pass between Nansemond river and the Dismal Swamp,\r\nwhich covers the country below, from being entered by us. More accurate\r\ninformation of their force, than we at first had, gives us reason to\r\nsuppose them to be from twenty-five hundred to three thousand strong,\r\nof which between sixty and seventy are cavalry. They are commanded by\r\nGeneral Leslie, and were convoyed by the Romulus, of forty guns, the\r\nBlonde, of thirty-two guns, the Delight sloop, of sixteen, a twenty-gun\r\nship of John Goodwick's, and two row gallies, commanded by Commodore\r\nGrayton. We are not assured, as yet, that they have landed their whole\r\nforce. Indeed, they give out themselves, that after drawing the force\r\nof this State to Suffolk, they mean to go to Baltimore. Their movements\r\nhad induced me to think they came with an expectation of meeting with\r\nLord Cornwallis in this country, that his precipitate retreat has left\r\nthem without a concerted object, and that they were waiting further\r\norders. Information of this morning says, that being informed of\r\nLord Cornwallis's retreat, and a public paper having been procured by\r\nthem, wherein were printed the several despatches which brought this\r\nintelligence from General Gates, they unladed a vessel and sent her off\r\nto Charleston immediately. The fate of this army of theirs hangs on a\r\nvery slender naval force, indeed.\r\n\r\nThe want of barracks at fort Frederick, as represented by Colonel\r\nWood, the difficulty of getting wagons sufficient to move the whole\r\nConvention troops, and the state of uneasiness in which the regiment\r\nof guards is, have induced me to think it would be better to move\r\nthese troops in two divisions; and as the whole danger of desertion\r\nto the enemy, and correspondence with the disaffected in our southern\r\ncounties, is from the British only, (for from the Germans we have no\r\napprehensions on either head,) we have advised Colonel Wood to move\r\non the British in the first division, and to leave the Germans in\r\ntheir present situation, to form a second division, when barracks may\r\nbe erected at fort Frederick. By these means, the British may march\r\nimmediately under the guard of Colonel Crochet's battalion, while\r\nColonel Taylor's regiment of guards remains with the Germans. I cannot\r\nsuppose this will be deemed such a separation as is provided against\r\nby the Convention, nor that their officers will wish to have the whole\r\ntroops crowded into barracks, probably not sufficient for half of them.\r\nShould they, however, insist on their being kept together, I suppose it\r\nwould be the opinion that the second division should follow the first\r\nas soon as possible, and that their being exposed, in that case, to\r\na want of covering, would be justly imputable to themselves only. The\r\ndelay of the second division, will lessen the distress for provisions,\r\nwhich may, perhaps, take place on their first going to the new post,\r\nbefore matters are properly arranged.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, November 10, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I inclose your Excellency a copy of an intercepted letter from\r\nMajor General Leslie, to Lord Cornwallis.[94] It was taken from a\r\nperson endeavoring to pass through the country from Portsmouth towards\r\nCarolina. When apprehended, and a proposal made to search him, he\r\nreadily consented to be searched, but, at the same time, was observed\r\nto put his hand into his pocket and carry something towards his mouth,\r\nas if it were a quid of tobacco; it was examined, and found to be a\r\nletter, of which the inclosed is a copy, written on silk paper, rolled\r\nup in gold-beater's skin, and nicely tied at each end, so as not to be\r\nlarger than a goose-quill. As this is the first authentic disclosure\r\nof their purpose in coming here, and may serve to found, with somewhat\r\nmore of certainty, conjectures respecting their future movements, while\r\ntheir disappointment in not meeting with Lord Cornwallis may occasion\r\nnew plans at New York, I thought it worthy of communication to your\r\nExcellency.\r\n\r\nSome deserters were taken yesterday, said to be of the British\r\nConvention troops, who have found means to get to the enemy at\r\nPortsmouth, and were seventy or eighty miles on their way back to the\r\nbarracks, when they were taken. They were passing under the guise of\r\ndeserters from Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem and respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----[95].\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, November 10, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 3d instant, enclosing Colonel Preston's letter,\r\ncame to hand on the 8th. The proposals mentioned in the Colonel's\r\nletter, for sending volunteers to you, were accepted, and put, as was\r\nnecessary, into such precise form as that all parties might know what\r\nthey had a right to expect. In doing this, two circumstances happened\r\nto interfere with what had been expected. We required that they should\r\nbe subject to your orders, and those of such other officer as you\r\nshould place them under: this was to enable you to make use of them\r\nin constituting the corps you had proposed under General Morgan; 2,\r\nthat there should be two companies of rifles only to each battalion:\r\nthis was the advice of General Morgan in a conversation with me. We\r\nhave since dispensed with the last of these conditions, and allowed\r\nevery man to carry his rifle, as we found that absolutely necessary\r\nto induce them to go. Colonel Skiller, of Boletourt, writes me he has\r\n150 engaged, and we shall endeavor to prevail upon Colonel Campbell to\r\nraise another corps, in which, if he undertakes it, I trust he will\r\nsucceed. I am much at a loss what should be done as to the prisoners\r\ntaken at King's Mountain. I do not think Montgomery Courthouse good\r\nplace, because it is very disaffected. It is too near their own\r\ncountry, and would admit their co-operation in any enterprize on our\r\nlead mines, which are about eight miles from thence. I have taken\r\nmeasures for continuing their march under a guard northwardly, and\r\nin the meantime for receiving instructions from Congress where to\r\nterminate their journey. The British Convention troops will proceed\r\nimmediately to Fort Frederick in Maryland. The Germans will remain\r\nin Albemarle till accommodations can be provided for them in the same\r\nplace. From them we have no apprehensions of desertion to the enemy.\r\nSome British were taken yesterday, who are said to have been with\r\nthe enemy, and were returning to the barracks. Two or three days ago,\r\na British emissary from Portsmouth was taken endeavoring to proceed\r\ntowards Carolina. On a proposal to search him, they observed him to\r\nput his hand in his pocket and put something to his mouth like a quid\r\nof tobacco. On examination it was found to be a letter, of which the\r\nenclosed is a copy, written on silk paper, rolled up in gold beater's\r\nskin, and nicely tied at each end, the whole not larger than a\r\ngoose-quill. By this you will find our conjectures verified, that they\r\nexpected to meet with Lord Cornwallis in the neighborhood at least of\r\nthis county, and are disappointed and without an object. Can you not\r\ntake measures for finding out the other messenger to Lord Cornwallis,\r\nwho went by land? The force we shall now immediately have together,\r\nauthorizes me to assure you, you need not apprehend their penetrating\r\nany distance southwardly. I only lament that this measure should have\r\nintercepted our reinforcements to you. We have left all the counties\r\nsouth of James River, and nearer to Hillsborough than Portsmouth,\r\nuncalled on, that they may be ready to go to the aid of our Southern\r\nfriends whenever arms can be procured.\r\n\r\nI am, with the greatest esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD STEVENS.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, November 10, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your two letters of October 24th and October -- have been\r\nduly received. I have been informed that the beeves which have been\r\ncollected in Princess Anne and Norfolk, to be sent southwardly, were\r\nthe first things which fell into the hands of the enemy. We received\r\nnotice of this invasion a few hours after you left this place, and\r\ndespatched a letter to recall you, which we expected would have found\r\nyou in Petersburg. However, you had gone on, and as there should be a\r\ngeneral officer with the men from this State in the Southern service,\r\nand we have here three general officers, we have not repeated our call\r\nfor your assistance. The force called on to oppose the enemy, is as\r\nyet in a most chaotic state, consisting of fragments of three months'\r\nmilitia, eight months' men, eighteen months' men, volunteers, and new\r\nmilitia.\r\n\r\nWere it possible to arm men, we would send on substantial\r\nreinforcements to you, notwithstanding the presence of the enemy with\r\nus; but the prospect of arms with us is very bad indeed. I have never\r\nreceived a line from Mr. Lambe as to his success in pressing wagons.\r\nNone have yet come in from the westward. The Executive were so far from\r\nallowing the eight months' men to enlist into the Volunteer Corps,\r\nas you say, they pretend they were expressly excluded from it in the\r\nseveral propositions we made for raising volunteers. Nothing of moment\r\nhas happened here since the arrival of the enemy. General Muhlenburg is\r\nat Stoaner's Mills, at the head of Pagan Creek, with our main force.\r\nGeneral Nelson is on the north side of James River with another body.\r\nGeneral Weeden is gone to join the one or the other. A British emissary\r\nwas taken two or three days ago with a letter from General Leslie to\r\nLord Cornwallis, informing him he was at Portsmouth, but could not\r\nlearn where his Lordship was; that he had sent one letter to him to\r\nCharlestown by water, another by land, and waited his orders. Cannot\r\nmeasures be taken to apprehend the messenger who went by land?\r\n\r\nI am, with the greatest esteem, Sir, your most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.[96]\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, November 19, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The vessel which had been sent by General Leslie to Charlestown,\r\nas we supposed, returned about the 12th instant. The enemy began\r\nto embark soon after from Portsmouth, and in the night of the 15th,\r\ncompleted the embarkation of their whole force. On the morning of the\r\n16th, some of our people entered Portsmouth. They had left their works\r\nunfinished and undestroyed. Great numbers of negroes, who had gone\r\nover to them, were left, either for the want of ship-room or through\r\nchoice. They had not moved from Elizabeth river at 11 o'clock a. m. of\r\nthe 16th. They gave out that they intended to go up James River; but\r\nthe precipitate abandoning of works on receipt of some communication or\r\nother from Charlestown, was not likely to be for the purpose of coming\r\nup James River. I received this intelligence by express from General\r\nMuhlenburg yesterday morning. As the enemy's situation was such as\r\nto give reason to expect every moment a movement in some direction, I\r\ndelayed sending off notice to you, in hopes that that movement would\r\npoint out their destination. But no such information being yet come\r\nto hand, I think it proper no longer to delay communicating to you so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nSince writing so far, your favor of the 8th instant comes to hand,\r\naccompanied by one from General Stevens at Hillsborough of the 10th--a\r\nstrange derangement, indeed, our riders have got into, to be nine days\r\ncoming from Hillsborough. I shall be very happy if the departure of\r\nthe enemy, which I hourly expect to be confirmed, shall leave us at\r\nliberty to send you a substantial reinforcement. The men, being now\r\nin the field, may be marched directly southwardly. What may be its\r\nprecise amount, I cannot say, till I get from General Muhlenburg a\r\nreturn of the eighteen months' men, the eight months' men, and militia,\r\nwho had been stopped here on their way to the southward, and from\r\nGeneral Lawson a return of the volunteers he has engaged to go to the\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, November 26, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with your Excellency's letter of the 8th\r\ninstant. Having found it impracticable to move, suddenly, the whole\r\nConvention troops, British and German, and it being represented that\r\nthere could not, immediately, be covering provided for them all at\r\nFort Frederick, we concluded to march off the British first, from whom\r\nwas the principal danger of desertion, and to permit the Germans, who\r\nshow little disposition to join the enemy, to remain in their present\r\nquarters till something further be done. The British, accordingly,\r\nmarched the 20th instant. They cross the Blue Ridge at Rock Fish Gap,\r\nand proceed along that valley. I am to apprise your Excellency, that\r\nthe officers of every rank, both British and German, but particularly\r\nthe former, have purchased within this State some of the finest\r\nhorses in it. You will be pleased to determine, whether it be proper\r\nthat they carry them within their lines. I believe the Convention of\r\nSaratoga entitles them to keep the horses they then had. But I presume\r\nnone of the line, below the rank of field officers, had a horse.\r\nConsidering the British will be now at Fort Frederick, and the Germans\r\nin Albemarle, Alexandria seems to be the most central point to which\r\nthere is navigation. Would it not, therefore, be better that the flag\r\nvessel, solicited by General Phillips, should go to that place? It\r\nis about equally distant from the two posts. The roads to Albemarle\r\nare good. I know not how those are which lead to Fort Frederick. Your\r\nletter referring me to General Green, for the mode of constructing\r\nlight portable boats, unfortunately did not come to hand till he had\r\nleft us. We had before determined to have something done in that way,\r\nand as they are still unexecuted, we should be greatly obliged by any\r\ndraughts or hints, which could be given by any person within the reach\r\nof your Excellency.\r\n\r\nI received advice, that on the 22d instant, the enemy's fleet got all\r\nunder way, and were standing towards the capes: as it still remained\r\nundecided whether they would leave the bay or turn up it, I waited the\r\nnext stage of information, that you might so far be enabled to judge\r\nof their destination. This I hourly expected, but it did not come till\r\nthis evening, when I am informed they all got out to sea in the night\r\nof the 22d. What course they steered afterwards, is not known. I must\r\ndo their General and Commander the justice to say, that in every case\r\nto which their attention and influence could reach, as far as I have\r\nbeen well informed, their conduct was such as does them the greatest\r\nhonor. In the few instances of wanton and unnecessary devastation, they\r\npunished the aggressors.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be,\r\n\r\n            Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD STEVENS.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, November 26, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The enemy, which lately invaded us, left our capes in the night\r\nof the 22d instant. What course they steered afterwards, is not known.\r\nAnother fleet of transports, under the command of Admiral Rodney, fell\r\ndown to the Hook on the 11th instant. As this, as well as the fleet,\r\nwhich lately left us, is destined for Charleston, we shall march from\r\ntheir present encampment all the forces who are so equipped as that\r\nthey can proceed to distant service. With them, will go on between\r\nthree and four hundred tents belonging to this State. Three hundred\r\nmore are on the road from Philadelphia, and as many to follow. As\r\nBaron Steuben remains here to organize our forces, I shall be obliged,\r\nby special returns of the eighteen months' men, eight months' men,\r\nand three months' Militia, which have or shall come unto you as\r\nfrequently as convenient. The Assembly being now met, will shortly,\r\nI hope, furnish us with money, so that we may be once more able to\r\nsend supplies to the southward. We have collected here, at length, by\r\nimpress principles, about thirty wagons, which have been delivered to\r\nthe Continental Quarter-Master, to be sent on with stores to Taylor's\r\nFerry.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, sir,\r\n\r\n                   Your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LT. JOHN LOUIS DE UNGER.[97]\r\n\r\n                                          RICHMOND, November 30th, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The letter which covers this, being of a public nature, I\r\nwished to acknowledge separately the many things personally obliging\r\nto me, expressed in your two letters. The very small amusement which\r\nit has been in my power to furnish, in order to lighten some of your\r\nheavy hours, by no means merited the acknowledgment you make. Their\r\nimpression must be ascribed to your extreme sensibility rather than to\r\ntheir own weight. My wishes for your happiness give me participation\r\nin your joy at being exchanged, sensibly, however, alloyed by a\r\npresentiment of the loss I shall sustain, when I shall again be\r\npermitted to withdraw to that scene of quiet retirement, abstracted\r\nfrom which I know no happiness in this world. Your line of life must\r\nhave given you attachments to objects of a very different nature.\r\nWhen the course of events shall have removed you to distant scenes\r\nof action, where laurels, not tarnished with the blood of my country,\r\nmay be gathered, I shall urge sincere prayers for your obtaining every\r\nhonor and preferment which may gladden the heart of a soldier. On the\r\nother hand, should your fondness for philosophy resume its merited\r\nascendancy, is it impossible to hope that this unexplored country may\r\ntempt your residence by holding out materials wherewith to build a\r\nfame, founded on the happiness and not the calamities of human nature?\r\nBe this as it may, whether philosopher or soldier, I wish you many\r\nfelicities, and assure you that I am, with great personal esteem, Sir,\r\n\r\n              Your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, December 15, 1780.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of writing to your Excellency on the subject of\r\nan expedition contemplated by this State, against the British post at\r\nDetroit, and of receiving your answer of October the 10th. Since the\r\ndate of my letter, the face of things has so far changed, as to leave\r\nit no longer optional in us to attempt or decline the expedition, but\r\ncompels us to decide in the affirmative, and to begin our preparations\r\nimmediately. The army the enemy at present have in the south, the\r\nreinforcements still expected there, and their determination to direct\r\ntheir future exertions to that quarter, are not unknown to you. The\r\nregular force, proposed on our part to counteract those exertions, is\r\nsuch, either from the real or supposed inability of this State, as by\r\nno means to allow a hope that it may be effectual. It is, therefore,\r\nto be expected that the scene of war will either be within our country,\r\nor very nearly advanced to it; and that our principal dependence is to\r\nbe on militia, for which reason it becomes incumbent to keep as great\r\na proportion of our people as possible free to act in that quarter.\r\nIn the meantime, a combination is forming in the westward, which, if\r\nnot diverted, will call thither a principal and most valuable part of\r\nour militia. From intelligence received, we have reason to expect that\r\na confederacy of British and Indians, to the amount of two thousand\r\nmen, is formed for the purpose of spreading destruction and dismay\r\nthrough the whole extent of our frontier in the ensuing spring. Should\r\nthis take place, we shall certainly lose in the South all aids of\r\nmilitia beyond the Blue Ridge, besides the inhabitants who must fall a\r\nsacrifice in the course of the savage irruptions.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be but one method of preventing this, which is, to\r\ngive the western enemy employment in their own country. The regular\r\nforce Colonel Clarke already has, with a proper draft from the militia\r\nbeyond the Alleghany, and that of three or four of our most northern\r\ncounties, will be adequate to the reduction of Fort Detroit, in the\r\nopinion of Colonel Clarke; and he assigns the most probable reasons\r\nfor that opinion. We have, therefore, determined to undertake it, and\r\ncommit it to his direction. Whether the expense of the enterprise\r\nshall be defrayed by the Continent or State, we will leave to be\r\ndecided hereafter by Congress, in whose justice we can confide, as\r\nto the determination. In the meantime, we only ask the loan of such\r\nnecessaries as, being already at Fort Pitt, will save time and an\r\nimmense expense of transportation. These articles shall either be\r\nidentically or specifically returned; should we prove successful, it is\r\nnot improbable they may be where Congress would choose to keep them. I\r\nam, therefore, to solicit your Excellency's order to the commandant of\r\nFort Pitt, for the articles contained in the annexed list, which shall\r\nnot be called for until everything is in readiness; after which, there\r\ncan be no danger of their being wanted for the post at which they are:\r\nindeed, there are few of the articles essential for the defence of the\r\npost.\r\n\r\nI hope your Excellency will think yourself justified in lending us\r\nthis aid, without awaiting the effect of an application elsewhere, as\r\nsuch a delay would render the undertaking abortive, by postponing it\r\nto the breaking up of the ice in the lake. Independent of the favorable\r\neffects, which a successful enterprise against Detroit must produce to\r\nthe United States, in general, by keeping in quiet the frontier of the\r\nnorthern ones, and leaving our western militia at liberty to aid those\r\nof the South, we think the like friendly office performed by us to the\r\nStates, whenever desired, and almost to the absolute exhausture of our\r\nown magazines, give well-founded hopes that we may be accommodated\r\non this occasion. The supplies of military stores, which have been\r\nfurnished by us to Fort Pitt itself, to the northern army, and, most of\r\nall, to the southern, are not altogether unknown to you. I am the more\r\nurgent for an immediate order, because Colonel Clarke awaits here your\r\nExcellency's answer by the express, though his presence in the western\r\ncountry, to make preparations for the expedition, is so very necessary\r\nif you enable him to undertake it. To the above, I must add a request\r\nto you to send for us to Pittsburg, persons proper to work the mortars,\r\n&c., as Colonel Clarke has none such, nor is there one in this State.\r\nThey shall be in the pay of this State, from the time they leave you.\r\nAny money necessary for their journey, shall be repaid at Pittsburg,\r\nwithout fail, by the first of March.\r\n\r\nAt the desire of the General Assembly, I take the liberty of\r\ntransmitting to you the enclosed resolution; and have the honor to\r\nbe, with the most perfect esteem and regard, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, January 10, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--It may seem odd, considering the important events which have\r\ntaken place in this State within the course of ten days, that I\r\nshould not have transmitted an account of them to your Excellency; but\r\nsuch has been their extraordinary rapidity, and such the unremitted\r\nattention they have required from all concerned in government, that I\r\ndo not recollect the portion of time which I could have taken to commit\r\nthem to paper.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of December, a letter, from a private gentleman to General\r\nNelson, came to my hands, notifying, that in the morning of the\r\npreceding day, twenty-seven sail of vessels had entered the capes; and\r\nfrom the tenor of the letter, we had reason to expect, within a few\r\nhours, further intelligence; whether they were friends or foes, their\r\nforce, and other circumstances. We immediately despatched General\r\nNelson to the lower country, with powers to call on the militia in\r\nthat quarter, or act otherwise as exigencies should require; but waited\r\nfurther intelligence, before we would call for militia from the middle\r\nor upper country. No further intelligence came until the 2d instant,\r\nwhen the former was confirmed; it was ascertained they had advanced\r\nup James River in Wanasqueak bay. All arrangements were immediately\r\ntaken, for calling in a sufficient body of militia for opposition.\r\nIn the night of the 3d, we received advice that they were at anchor\r\nopposite Jamestown; we then supposed Williamsburg to be their object.\r\nThe wind, however, which had hitherto been unfavorable, shifted fair,\r\nand the tide being also in their favor, they ascended the river to\r\nKennons' that evening, and, with the next tide, came up to Westover,\r\nhaving, on their way, taken possession of some works we had at Hood's,\r\nby which two or three of their vessels received some damage, but which\r\nwere of necessity abandoned by the small garrison of fifty men placed\r\nthere, on the enemy's landing to invest the works. Intelligence of\r\ntheir having quitted the station at Jamestown, from which we supposed\r\nthey meant to land for Williamsburg, and of their having got in the\r\nevening to Kennons', reached us the next morning at five o'clock, and\r\nwas the first indication of their meaning to penetrate towards this\r\nplace or Petersburg. As the orders for drawing militia here had been\r\ngiven but two days, no opposition was in readiness. Every effort was\r\ntherefore necessary, to withdraw the arms and other military stores,\r\nrecords, &c., from this place. Every effort was, accordingly, exerted\r\nto convey them to the foundry five miles, and to a laboratory six\r\nmiles, above this place, till about sunset of that day, when we learned\r\nthe enemy had come to an anchor at Westover that morning. We then knew\r\nthat this, and not Petersburg was their object, and began to carry\r\nacross the river everything remaining here, and to remove what had\r\nbeen transported to the foundry and laboratory to Westham, the nearest\r\ncrossing, seven miles above this place, which operation was continued\r\ntill they had approached very near. They marched from Westover at\r\ntwo o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th, and entered Richmond at one\r\no'clock in the afternoon of the 5th. A regiment of infantry and about\r\nthirty horse continued on, without halting, to the foundry. They burnt\r\nthat, the boring mill, the magazine and two other houses, and proceeded\r\nto Westham; but nothing being in their power there, they retired to\r\nRichmond. The next morning, they burned some buildings of public and\r\nprivate property, with what stores remained in them, destroyed a great\r\nquantity of private stores, and about twelve o'clock, retired towards\r\nWestover, where they encamped within the neck the next day.\r\n\r\nThe loss sustained is not yet accurately known. As far as I have\r\nbeen able to discover, it consisted, at this place, of about three\r\nhundred muskets, some soldiers' clothing to a small amount, some\r\nquarter-master's stores, of which one hundred and twenty sides of\r\nleather was the principal article, part of the artificers' tools, and\r\nthree wagons. Besides which, five brass four pounders which we had\r\nsunk in the river, were discovered to them, raised and carried off. At\r\nthe foundry we lost the greater part of the papers belonging to the\r\nAuditor's office, and of the books and papers of the Council office.\r\nAbout five or six tons of powder, as we conjecture, was thrown into the\r\ncanal, of which there will be a considerable saving by re-manufacturing\r\nit. The roof of the foundry was burned, but the stacks of chimneys and\r\nfurnaces not at all injured. The boring mill was consumed. Within less\r\nthan forty-eight hours from the time of their landing, and nineteen\r\nfrom our knowing their destination, they had penetrated thirty-three\r\nmiles, done the whole injury, and retired. Their numbers, from the best\r\nintelligence I have had, are about fifteen hundred infantry; and, as\r\nto their cavalry, accounts vary from fifty to one hundred and twenty;\r\nthe whole commanded by the parricide Arnold. Our militia, dispersed\r\nover a large tract of country, can be called in but slowly. On the\r\nday the enemy advanced to this place, two hundred only were embodied.\r\nThey were of this town and its neighborhood, and were too few to\r\ndo anything. At this time they are assembled in pretty considerable\r\nnumbers on the south side of James River, but are not yet brought to a\r\npoint. On the north side are two or three small bodies, amounting in\r\nthe whole, to about nine hundred men. The enemy were at four o'clock\r\nyesterday evening still remaining in their encampment at Westover and\r\nBerkeley neck. In the meanwhile, Baron Steuben, a zealous friend, has\r\ndescended from the dignity of his proper command to direct our smallest\r\nmovements. His vigilance has, in a great measure, supplied the want\r\nof force in preventing the enemy from crossing the river, which might\r\nhave been very fatal. He has been assiduously employed in preparing\r\nequipments for the militia as they should assemble, pointing them to\r\na proper object, and other offices of a good commander. Should they\r\nloiter a little longer, and he be able to have a sufficient force, I\r\nstill flatter myself they will not escape with total impunity. To what\r\nplace they will point their next exertions we cannot even conjecture.\r\nThe whole country on the tide waters and some distance from them is\r\nequally open to similar insult. I have the honor to be, with every\r\nsentiment of respect, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, January 15, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--As the dangers which threaten our western frontiers the ensuing\r\nspring, render it necessary that we should send thither Colonel\r\nCrocket's battalion, at present on guard at Fredericktown, but raised\r\nfor the western service, I thought it necessary to give your Excellency\r\nprevious information thereof, that other forces may be provided in\r\ntime to succeed to their duties. Captain Reid's troop of horse, if\r\nnecessary, may be continued a while longer on guard.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, January 15, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received some time ago from Major Forsyth, and afterwards from\r\nyou, a requisition to furnish one half of the supplies of provision for\r\nthe Convention troops, removed into Maryland. I should sooner have done\r\nmyself the honor of writing to you on this subject, but that I hoped to\r\nhave laid it before you more fully than could be done in writing, by a\r\ngentleman who was to pass on other public business to Philadelphia. The\r\nlate events in this State having retarded his setting out, I think it\r\nmy duty no longer to postpone explanation on this head.\r\n\r\nYou cannot be unapprised of the powerful armies of our enemy, at\r\nthis time in this and the southern States, and that their future\r\nplan is to push their successes in the same quarter, by still\r\nlarger reinforcements. The forces to be opposed to these must be\r\nproportionably great, and these forces must be fed. By whom are they\r\nto be fed? Georgia and South Carolina are annihilated, at least as to\r\nus. By the requisition to us to send provisions into Maryland, it is to\r\nbe supposed that none are to come to the southern army from any State\r\nnorth of this; for it would seem inconsistent, that while we should be\r\nsending North, Maryland and other States beyond that, should be sending\r\ntheir provisions South. Upon North Carolina, then, already exhausted\r\nby the ravages of two armies, and on this State, are to depend for\r\nsubsistence those bodies of men who are to oppose the greater part of\r\nthe enemy's force in the United States, the subsistence of the German,\r\nand of half the British Conventioners. To take a view of this matter\r\non the Continental requisitions of November the 4th, 1780, for specific\r\nquotas of provisions, it is observable that North Carolina and Virginia\r\nare to furnish 10,475,740 pounds of animal food, and 13,529 barrels of\r\nflour, while the States north of these will yield 25,293,810 pounds of\r\nanimal food, and 106,471 barrels of flour.\r\n\r\nIf the greater part of the British armies be employed in the South,\r\nit is to be supposed that the greater part of the American force will\r\nbe sent there to oppose them. But should this be the case, while the\r\ndistribution of the provisions is so very unequal, would it be proper\r\nto render it still more so, by withdrawing a part of our contributions\r\nto the support of posts northward of us? It would certainly be a\r\ngreat convenience to us, to deliver a portion of our specifics at\r\nFredericktown, rather than in Carolina; but I leave it to you to judge,\r\nwhether this would be consistent with the general good or safety.\r\nInstead of sending aids of any kind to the northward, it seems but too\r\ncertain that unless very timely and substantial assistance be received\r\nfrom thence, our enemies are yet far short of the ultimate term of\r\ntheir successes. I beg leave, therefore, to refer to you whether the\r\nspecifics of Maryland, as far as shall be necessary, had not better be\r\napplied to the support of the posts within it, for which its quota is\r\nmuch more than sufficient, or, were it otherwise whether those of the\r\nStates north of Maryland had not better be called on, than to detract\r\nanything from the resources of the southern opposition, already much\r\ntoo small for the encounter to which it is left. I am far from wishing\r\nto count or measure out contributions by the requisitions of Congress.\r\nWere they ever so much beyond these, I should readily strain them in\r\naid of any one of our sister States. But while they are so far short\r\nof those calls to which they must be pointed in the first instance, it\r\nwould be great misapplication to divert them to any other purpose; and\r\nI am persuaded you will think me perfectly within the line of duty,\r\nwhen I ask a revisal of this requisition.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, sir,\r\n\r\n              Your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, January 17, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I do myself the honor of transmitting to your Excellency a\r\nresolution of the General Assembly of this Commonwealth, entered into\r\nin consequence of the resolution of Congress of September the 6th,\r\n1780, on the subject of the Confederation. I shall be rendered very\r\nhappy if the other States of the Union, equally impressed with the\r\nnecessity of that important convention, shall be willing to sacrifice\r\nequally to its completion. This single event, could it take place\r\nshortly, would overweigh every success which the enemy have hitherto\r\nobtained, and render desperate the hopes to which those successes have\r\ngiven birth.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most real esteem and respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE VIRGINIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, January 18, 1781.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I enclose you a Resolution of Assembly, directing your\r\nconduct as to the navigation of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe loss of powder lately sustained by us (about five tons), together\r\nwith the quantities sent on to the southward, have reduced our stock\r\nvery low indeed. We lent to Congress, in the course of the last\r\nyear (previous to our issues for the southern army), about ten tons\r\nof powder. I shall be obliged to you, to procure an order from the\r\nboard of war, for any quantity from five to ten tons, to be sent\r\nus immediately from Philadelphia or Baltimore, and to enquire into\r\nand hasten, from time to time, the execution of it. The stock of\r\ncartridge-paper is nearly exhausted. I do not know whether Captain\r\nIrish, or what other officer, should apply for this. It is essential\r\nthat a good stock should be forwarded, and without a moment's delay.\r\nIf there be a rock on which we are to split, it is the want of muskets,\r\nbayonets and cartouch-boxes.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences, since my last to the President, are not of any\r\nmagnitude. Three little rencounters have happened with the enemy. In\r\nthe first, General Smallwood led on a party of two or three hundred\r\nmilitia, and obliged some armed vessels of the enemy to retire from\r\na prize they had taken at Broadway's, and renewing his attack the\r\nnext day with a four-pounder or two (for on the first day he had only\r\nmuskets), he obliged some of their vessels to fall down from City Point\r\nto their main fleet at Westover. The enemy's loss is not known; ours\r\nwas four men wounded. One of the evenings, during their encampment at\r\nWestover and Berkeley, their light horse surprised a party of about\r\none hundred or one hundred and fifty militia at Charles City Court\r\nHouse, killed and wounded four, and took, as has been generally said,\r\nabout seven or eight. On Baron Steuben's approach towards Hood's, they\r\nembarked at Westover; the wind which, till then, had set directly up\r\nthe river from the time of their leaving Jamestown, shifted in the\r\nmoment to the opposite point. Baron Steuben had not reached Hood's,\r\nby eight or ten miles, when they arrived there. They landed their\r\nwhole army in the night, Arnold attending in person. Captain Clarke\r\n(of Kaskaskias) had been sent on with two hundred and forty men by\r\nBaron Steuben, and having properly disposed of them in ambuscade,\r\ngave them a deliberate fire, which killed seventeen on the spot, and\r\nwounded thirteen. They returned it in confusion by which we had three\r\nor four wounded, and our party being so small and without bayonets,\r\nwere obliged to retire, on the enemy's charging with bayonets. They\r\nfell down to Cobham, whence they carried all the tobacco there (about\r\nsixty hogsheads); and the last intelligence was, that on the 16th,\r\nthey were standing for New-ports-news. Baron Steuben is of opinion,\r\nthey are proceeding to fix a post in some of the lower counties.\r\nLater information has given no reason to believe their force more\r\nconsiderable than we at first supposed. I think, since the arrival of\r\nthe three transports which had been separated in a storm, they may be\r\nconsidered as about two thousand strong. Their naval force, according\r\nto the best intelligence, is the Charon, of forty-four guns, Commodore\r\nSymmonds, the Amphitrite, Iris, Thames, and Charlestown frigates, the\r\nForvey, of twenty guns, two sloops of war, a privateer ship and two\r\nbrigs. We have about thirty-seven hundred militia embodied, but at\r\npresent they are divided into three distant encampments: one under\r\nGeneral Weeden, at Fredericksburg, for the protection of the important\r\nworks there; another under General Nelson, at and near Williamsburg;\r\nand a third under Baron Steuben, at Cabin Point. As soon as the enemy\r\nfix themselves, these will be brought to a point.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very great respect, gentlemen, your most\r\nobedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----[98].\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, January 21, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Acquainted as you are with the treasons of Arnold, I need say\r\nnothing for your information, or to give you a proper sentiment of\r\nthem. You will readily suppose, that it is above all things desirable\r\nto drag him from those under whose wing he is now sheltered. On his\r\nmarch to and from this place, I am certain it might have been done with\r\nfacility by men of enterprise and firmness. I think it may still be\r\ndone, though perhaps not quite so easily. Having peculiar confidence\r\nin the men from the western side of the mountains, I meant, as soon\r\nas they should come down, to get the enterprise proposed to a chosen\r\nnumber of them: such whose courage and whose fidelity would be above\r\nall doubt. Your perfect knowledge of those men personally, and my\r\nconfidence in your discretion, induces me to ask you to pick from among\r\nthem proper characters, in such numbers as you think best, to reveal\r\nto them our desire, and engage them to undertake to seize and bring\r\noff this greatest of all traitors. Whether this may be best affected\r\nby their going in as friends, and awaiting their opportunity, or\r\notherwise, is left to themselves. The smaller the number the better,\r\nso that they be sufficient to manage him. Every necessary caution\r\nmust be used on their part, to prevent a discovery of their design\r\nby the enemy, as, should they be taken, the laws of war will justify\r\nagainst them the most rigorous sentence. I will undertake, if they are\r\nsuccessful in bringing him off alive, that they shall receive five\r\nthousand guineas reward among them. And to men, formed for such an\r\nenterprise, it must be a great incitement to know that their names will\r\nbe recorded with glory in history, with those of Vanwert, Paulding, and\r\nWilliams. The enclosed order from Baron Steuben will authorize you to\r\ncall for and dispose of any force you may think necessary, to place in\r\nreadiness for covering the enterprise and securing the retreat of the\r\nparty. Mr. Newton, the bearer of this, and to whom its contents are\r\ncommunicated in confidence, will provide men of trust to go as guides.\r\nThese may be associated in the enterprise or not, as you please. But\r\nlet that point be previously settled, that no difficulties may arise\r\nas to the parties entitled to participate of the reward. You know\r\nhow necessary profound secrecy is in this business, even if it be not\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                             RICHMOND, February 8, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have just received intelligence, which, though from a private\r\nhand, I believe is to be relied on, that a fleet of the enemy's ships\r\nhave entered Cape Fear river, that eight of them had got over the\r\nbar, and many others were laying off; and that it was supposed to be a\r\nreinforcement to Lord Cornwallis, under the command of General Prevost.\r\nThis account, which had come through another channel, is confirmed by a\r\nletter from General Parsons at Halifax, to the gentleman who forwards\r\nit to me. I thought it of sufficient importance to be communicated to\r\nyour Excellency by the stationed expresses. The fatal want of arms puts\r\nit out of our power to bring a greater force into the field, than will\r\nbarely suffice to restrain the adventures of the pitiful body of men\r\nthey have at Portsmouth. Should any more be added to them, this country\r\nwill be perfectly open to them, by land as well as water.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with all possible respect, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, February 12, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The enclosed extract of a letter from Governor Nash,[99] which\r\nI received this day, being a confirmation of the intelligence I\r\ntransmitted in a former letter, I take the liberty of transmitting it\r\nto your Excellency. I am informed, through a private channel on which\r\nI have considerable reliance, that the enemy had landed five hundred\r\ntroops under the command of a Major Craig, who were joined by a number\r\nof disaffected; that they had penetrated forty miles; that their aim\r\nappeared to be the magazine at Kingston, from which place they were\r\nabout twenty miles distant.\r\n\r\nBaron Steuben transmits to your Excellency a letter from General\r\nGreene, by which you will learn the events which have taken place in\r\nthat quarter since the defeat of Colonel Tarleton, by General Morgan.\r\nThese events speak best for themselves, and no doubt will suggest what\r\nis necessary to be done to prevent the successive losses of State after\r\nState, to which the want of arms and of a regular soldiery, seem more\r\nespecially to expose those in the South.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, February 17, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--By a letter from General Greene, dated Guilford Court House,\r\nFebruary 10th, we are informed that Lord Cornwallis had burnt his own\r\nwagons, in order to enable himself to move with greater facility, and\r\nhad pressed immediately on.[100] The prisoners taken at the Cowpens,\r\nwere happily saved by the accidental rise of a water-course, which gave\r\nso much time as to withdraw them from the reach of the enemy. Lord\r\nCornwallis had advanced to the vicinities of the Moravian towns, and\r\nwas still moving on rapidly. His object was supposed to be to compel\r\nGeneral Greene to an action, which, under the difference of force they\r\nhad, would probably be ruinous to the latter. General Greene meant to\r\nretire by the way of Boyd's ferry, on the Roanoke. As yet he had lost\r\nlittle or no stores or baggage, but they were far from being safe. In\r\nthe instant of receiving this intelligence, we ordered a reinforcement\r\nof militia to him, from the most convenient counties in which there\r\nwas a hope of finding any arms. Some great event must arise from the\r\npresent situation of things, which, for a long time, will determine the\r\ncondition of southern affairs.\r\n\r\nArnold lies close in his quarters. Two days ago, I received information\r\nof the arrival of a sixty-four gun ship and two frigates in our bay,\r\nbeing part of the fleet of our good ally at Rhode Island. Could they\r\nget at the British fleet here, they are sufficient to destroy them; but\r\nthese being drawn up into Elizabeth River, into which the sixty-four\r\ncannot enter, I apprehend they could do nothing more than block up\r\nthe river. This, indeed, would reduce the enemy, as we could cut off\r\ntheir supplies by land; but the operation being tedious, would probably\r\nbe too dangerous for the auxiliary force. Not having yet had any\r\nparticular information of the designs of the French Commander, I cannot\r\npretend to say what measures this aid will lead to.\r\n\r\nOur proposition to the Cherokee Chiefs, to visit Congress, for the\r\npurpose of preventing or delaying a rupture with that nation, was too\r\nlate. Their distresses had too much ripened their alienation from us,\r\nand the storm had gathered to a head, when Major Martin got back. It\r\nwas determined to carry the war into their country, rather than await\r\nit in ours, and thus disagreeably circumstanced, the issue has been\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe militia of this State and North Carolina penetrated into their\r\ncountry, burned almost every town they had, amounting to about one\r\nthousand houses in the whole, destroyed fifty thousand bushels of\r\ngrain, killed twenty-nine, and took seventeen prisoners. The latter are\r\nmostly women and children.\r\n\r\nI enclose your Excellency the particulars as reported to me. Congress\r\nwill be pleased to determine on Col. Campbell's proposition to build\r\nthe fort at the confluence of the Holston and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, &c., your Excellency's most obedient humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. Since writing the above, I have received information which,\r\nthough not authentic, deserves attention: that Lord Cornwallis had\r\ngot to Boyd's ferry on the 14th. I am issuing orders, in consequence,\r\nto other counties, to embody and march all the men they can arm. In\r\nthis fatal situation, without arms, there will be no safety for the\r\nConvention troops but in their removal, which I shall accordingly\r\norder. The prisoners of the Cowpens were at New London (Bedford Court\r\nHouse) on the 14th.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, February 17, 1781.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--The situation of affairs here and in Carolina, is such\r\nas must shortly turn up important events, one way or the other. By\r\nletter from General Greene, dated Guilford Court House, February the\r\n10th, I learn that Lord Cornwallis, rendered furious by the affair\r\nat the Cowpens and the surprise of Georgetown, had burned his own\r\nwagons, to enable himself to move with facility, had pressed on to the\r\nvicinity of the Moravian towns, and was still advancing. The prisoners,\r\ntaken at the Cowpens, were saved by a hair's-breadth accident, and\r\nGreene was retreating. His force, two thousand regulars, and no\r\nmilitia; Cornwallis's, three thousand. General Davidson was killed in\r\na skirmish. Arnold lies still at Portsmouth with fifteen hundred men.\r\nA French sixty-four gun ship, and two frigates of thirty-six each,\r\narrived in our bay three days ago. They would suffice to destroy the\r\nBritish shipping here (a forty four frigate, and a twenty,) could they\r\nget at them. But these are withdrawn up Elizabeth river, which the\r\nsixty-four cannot enter. We have ordered about seven hundred riflemen\r\nfrom Washington, Montgomery and Bedford, and five hundred common\r\nmilitia from Pittsylvania and Henry, to reinforce General Greene; and\r\nfive hundred new levies will march from Chesterfield Court House, in a\r\nfew days. I have no doubt, however, that the southwestern counties will\r\nhave turned out in greater numbers before our orders reach them.\r\n\r\nI have been knocking at the door of Congress for aids of all kinds,\r\nbut especially of arms, ever since the middle of summer. The speaker,\r\nHarrison, is gone to be heard on that subject. Justice, indeed,\r\nrequires that we should be aided powerfully. Yet if they would repay\r\nus the arms we have lent them, we should give the enemy trouble, though\r\nabandoned to ourselves.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated applications, I have obtained a warrant for your advance\r\nmoney, £18,000, which I have put into the hands of Mr. McAlister, to\r\nreceive the money from the Treasurer, and carry it to you.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, February 17, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have received your several favors by Mr. Sathim, and am much\r\npleased at the happy issue of the expedition against the Cherokees.\r\nI wish it to be used for the purpose of bringing about peace, which,\r\nunder our present circumstances, is as necessary for us, as it can\r\npossibly be to them.\r\n\r\nIf you can effect this, a right should be reserved of building a fort\r\nat the confluence of Holston and Tennessee; a matter which we must\r\nrefer to Congress, as it lies not within our boundary. The prisoners\r\nyou have taken had better be kept for the purpose of exchanging for any\r\nof ours taken by them. Should any surplus be on hand at the conclusion\r\nof peace, they should be given up. Nancy Ward seems rather to have\r\ntaken refuge with you. In this case, her inclination ought to be\r\nfollowed as to what is done with her.\r\n\r\nAs by our laws, the pay of militia is made the same with that of the\r\nContinental troops, and that, by a resolution of Congress, is to be in\r\nthe new money of March 18th, 1780, or in old money at forty for one,\r\nI apprehend you will be paid at that rate. By a late arrangement, the\r\nCommissary is directed to have a deputy in every county. I hope that\r\nby their means the militia may henceforward be better supplied with\r\nprovisions when proceeding on an expedition. The fort at Powell's\r\nValley you will please to proceed on. We approve of the company you\r\nhave raised for patrolling against the Indians and garrisoning the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nI am, with much respect, sir, your most obedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, February 26, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I gave you information in my last letter, that General Greene had\r\ncrossed the Dan, at Boyd's ferry, and that Lord Cornwallis had arrived\r\nat the opposite shore. Large reinforcements of militia having embodied\r\nboth in front and rear of the enemy, he is retreating with as much\r\nrapidity as he advanced; his route is towards Hillsborough. General\r\nGreene re-crossed the Dan on the 21st, in pursuit of him. I have the\r\npleasure to inform you, that the spirit of opposition was as universal\r\nas could have been wished for. There was no restraint on the numbers\r\nthat embodied, but the want of arms.\r\n\r\nThe British at Portsmouth lie close in their lines. The French squadron\r\nkeep them in by water, and since their arrival, as they put it out of\r\nthe power of the enemy to cut off our retreat by sending up Nansemond\r\nriver, our force has been moved down close to their lines.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\n              Your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE MARBOIS.[101]\r\n\r\n                                              RICHMOND, March 4th, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with your letter of Feb. 5th. Mr. Jones did\r\nput into my hands a paper containing sundry inquiries into the present\r\nstate of Virginia, which he informed me was from yourself, and some of\r\nwhich I meant to do myself the honor of answering.\r\n\r\nHitherto it has been in my power to collect a few materials only, which\r\nmy present occupations disable me from completing. I mean, however,\r\nshortly to be in a condition which will leave me quite at leisure to\r\ntake them up, when it shall be one of my first undertakings to give you\r\nas full information as I shall be able to do on such of the subjects\r\nas are within the sphere of my acquaintance. On some of them, however,\r\nI trust Mr. Jones will engage abler hands. Those in particular which\r\nrelate to the commerce of the State, a subject with which I am wholly\r\nunacquainted, and which is probably the most important in your plan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                              RICHMOND, March 8th, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the pleasure of receiving a letter from General Greene,\r\ndated High-rock Ford, February 29th (probably March the 1st), who\r\ninforms me, that on the night of the 24th Colonel McCall surprised a\r\nsubaltern's guard at Hart's Mill, killed eight, and wounded and took\r\nnine prisoners, and that on the 25th General Pickens and Lieutenant\r\nColonel Lee routed a body of near three hundred Tories on the Haw\r\nriver, who were in arms to join the British army, killed upwards of one\r\nhundred, and wounded most of the rest, which had a very happy effect on\r\nthe disaffected in that country.\r\n\r\nBy a letter from Major Magill, an officer of this State, whom I had\r\nsent to General Greene's head-quarters for the purpose of giving us\r\nregular intelligence, dated Guilford County, March 2d, I am informed\r\nthat Lord Cornwallis, on his retreat, erected the British standard at\r\nHillsborough, that a number of disaffected under the command of Colonel\r\nPiles were resorting to it, when they were intercepted by General\r\nPickens and Lieutenant Colonel Lee, as mentioned by General Greene,\r\nand that their commanding officer was among the slain: that Lord\r\nCornwallis, after destroying everything he could, moved down the Haw\r\nriver from Hillsborough: that General Greene was within six miles of\r\nhim: that our superiority in the goodness, though not in the number of\r\nour cavalry, prevented the enemy from moving with rapidity or foraging.\r\nHaving been particular in desiring Major Magill to inform me what\r\ncorps of militia from this State joined General Greene, he accordingly\r\nmentioned that seven hundred under General Stevens, and four hundred\r\nfrom Botetourt, had actually joined him; that Colonel Campbell was to\r\njoin him that day with six hundred, and that Colonel Lynch with three\r\nhundred from Bedford, was shortly expected: the last three numbers\r\nbeing riflemen. Besides these mentioned by Major Magill, General\r\nLawson must, before this, have crossed Roanoke with a body of militia,\r\nthe number of which has not been stated to me. Report makes them a\r\nthousand; but I suppose the number to be exaggerated. Four hundred of\r\nour new levies left Chesterfield Court House on the 25th February, and\r\nprobably would cross the Roanoke about the 1st or 2d of March.\r\n\r\nI was honored with your Excellency's letter of February the 21st,\r\nwithin seven days after its date. We have, accordingly, been making\r\nevery preparation on our part which we are able to make. The militia\r\nproposed to co-operate, will be upwards of four thousand from this\r\nState, and one thousand or twelve hundred from Carolina, said to be\r\nunder General Gregory. The enemy are, at this time, in a great measure\r\nblockaded by land, there being a force on the east side of Elizabeth\r\nriver. They suffer for provisions, as they are afraid to venture far,\r\nlest the French squadron should be in the neighborhood, and come upon\r\nthem. Were it possible to block up the river, a little time would\r\nsuffice to reduce them by want and desertions, and would be more sure\r\nin its event than an attempt by storm. I shall be very happy to have it\r\nin my power to hand you a favorable account of these two armies in the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem and respect your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                               RICHMOND, March 19, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency a copy of a\r\nletter from General Greene, with some other intelligence received, not\r\ndoubting your anxiety to know the movements in the South. I find we\r\nhave deceived ourselves not a little by counting on the whole numbers\r\nof the militia which have been in motion, as if they had all remained\r\nwith General Greene, when, in fact, they seem only to have visited and\r\nquitted him.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis Fayette arrived at New York on the 15th. His troops still\r\nremained at the head of the bay, till the appearance of some force\r\nwhich should render their passage down safe.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and\r\nrespect, your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                                RICHMOND March 21, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The enclosed letter will inform you of the arrival of a British\r\nfleet in the Chesapeake bay.\r\n\r\nThe extreme negligence of our stationed expresses is no doubt the\r\ncause why, as yet, no authentic account has reached us of a general\r\naction, which happened on the 15th instant, about a mile and a half\r\nfrom Guilford Court House, between General Greene and Lord Cornwallis.\r\nCaptain Singleton, an intelligent officer of Harrison's artillery, who\r\nwas in the action, has this moment arrived here, and gives the general\r\ninformation that both parties were prepared and desirous for action;\r\nthe enemy were supposed about twenty-five hundred strong, our army\r\nabout four thousand. That, after a very warm and general engagement,\r\nof about an hour and a half, we retreated about a mile and a half from\r\nthe field, in good order, having, as he supposed, between two and three\r\nhundred killed and wounded: the enemy between five and seven hundred\r\nkilled and wounded; that we lost four pieces of artillery: that the\r\nmilitia, as well as regulars, behaved exceedingly well: that General\r\nGreene, he believes, would have renewed the action the next day, had\r\nit not proved rainy, and would renew it as soon as possible, as he\r\nsupposes: that the whole of his troops, both regulars and militia,\r\nwere in high spirits and wishing a second engagement: that the loss\r\nhas fallen pretty equally on the militia and regulars: that General\r\nStevens received a ball through the thigh. Major Anderson, of Maryland,\r\nwas killed, and Captain Barrett, of Washington's cavalry; Captain\r\nFauntleroy, of the same cavalry, was shot through the thigh, and left\r\non the field.\r\n\r\nCaptain Singleton, having left the camp the day after the battle, does\r\nnot speak from particular returns, none such having been then made. I\r\nmust inform your Excellency from him, till more regular applications\r\ncan reach you, that they are in _extreme want_ of lead, cartridge paper\r\nand thread. I think it improper, however it might urge an instantaneous\r\nsupply, to repeat to you his statement of the extent of their stock of\r\nthese articles. In a former letter, I mentioned to you the failure of\r\nthe vein of our lead mines, which has left the army here in a state of\r\nequal distress and danger.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very high respect and esteem, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. Look-out boats have been ordered from the seaboard of the eastern\r\nshore, to apprise the Commander of the French fleet, on its approach,\r\nof the British being in the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                   In Council, RICHMOND, March 26, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The appointment of commissioner to the war office of this\r\nState, having lately become vacant, the Executive are desirous to\r\nplace Colonel William Davies, of the Virginian Continentals, in that\r\noffice. This gentleman, however, declines undertaking it, unless his\r\nrank in the army, half pay for life and allowance for depreciation\r\nof pay, can be reserved to him; observing with justice, that these\r\nemoluments, distant as they are, are important to a person who has\r\nspent the most valuable part of his youth in the service of his\r\ncountry. As this indulgence rests in the power of Congress alone, I\r\nam induced to request it of them on behalf of the State, to whom it\r\nis very interesting that the office be properly filled, and I may\r\nsay, on behalf of the Continent also, to whom the same circumstance is\r\ninteresting, in proportion to its reliance upon this State for supplies\r\nto the southern war. We should not have given Congress the trouble of\r\nthis application, had we found it easy to call any other to the office,\r\nwho was likely to answer our wishes in the exercise of it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                               RICHMOND, March 28, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I forward to your Excellency, under cover with this, copies of\r\nletters received from Major General Greene and Baron Steuben, which\r\nwill give you the latest account of the situation of things with us and\r\nin North Carolina.\r\n\r\nI observe a late resolve of Congress, for furnishing a number of\r\narms to the southern States; and I lately wrote you on the subject of\r\nammunition and cartridge paper. How much of this State, the enemy thus\r\nreinforced, may think proper to possess themselves of, must depend on\r\ntheir own moderation and caution, till these supplies arrive. We had\r\nhoped to receive by the French squadron under Monsieur Destouches,\r\neleven hundred stand of arms, which we had at Rhode Island, but were\r\ndisappointed. The necessity of hurrying forward the troops intended for\r\nthe southern operations, will be doubtless apparent from this letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                               RICHMOND, March 31, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The letters and papers accompanying this will inform your\r\nExcellency of the arrival of a British flag vessel with clothing,\r\nrefreshments, money, &c., for their prisoners, under the Convention\r\nof Saratoga. The gentlemen conducting them, have, on supposition\r\nthat the prisoners, or a part of them, still remained in this State,\r\napplied to me by letters, copies of which I transmit your Excellency,\r\nfor leave to allow water transportation as far as possible, and then,\r\nfor themselves to attend them to the post where they are to be issued.\r\nThese indulgences were usually granted them here, but the prisoners\r\nbeing removed, it becomes necessary to transmit the application to\r\nCongress for their direction. In the meantime, the flag will wait in\r\nJames river.\r\n\r\nOur intelligence from General Greene's camp as late as the 24th, is,\r\nthat Lord Cornwallis's march of the day before had decided his route to\r\nCross creek.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the reinforcements to the enemy, arrived at Portsmouth,\r\nis not yet known with certainty. Accounts differ from fifteen hundred\r\nto much larger numbers. We are informed they have a considerable number\r\nof horse. The affliction of the people for want of arms is great; that\r\nof ammunition is not yet known to them. An apprehension is added, that\r\nthe enterprise on Portsmouth being laid aside, the troops under the\r\nMarquis Fayette will not come on. An enemy three thousand strong, not a\r\nregular in the State, nor arms to put in the hands of the militia, are,\r\nindeed, discouraging circumstances.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, April 7, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Hearing that our arms from Rhode Island have arrived at\r\nPhiladelphia, I have begged the favor of our Delegates to send them on\r\nin wagons immediately, and, for the conveyance of my letter, have taken\r\nthe liberty of setting the Continental line of expresses in motion,\r\nwhich I hope our distress for arms will justify, though the errand be\r\nnot purely Continental.\r\n\r\nI have nothing from General Greene later than the 27th of March; our\r\naccounts from Portsmouth vary the reinforcements, which came under\r\nGeneral Phillips, from twenty-five hundred to three thousand. Arnold's\r\nstrength before, was, I think, reduced to eleven hundred. They have\r\nmade no movement as yet. Their preparation of boats is considerable;\r\nwhether they mean to go southwardly or up the river, no leading\r\ncircumstance has yet decided.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                             In Council, April 18, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I was honored, yesterday with your Excellency's favor enclosing\r\nthe resolutions of Congress of the 8th instant, for removing stores and\r\nprovisions from the counties of Accomack and Northampton. We have there\r\nno military stores, except a few muskets in the hands of the militia.\r\nThere are some collections of forage and provisions belonging to the\r\nContinent, and some to the State, and the country there, generally,\r\nfurnishes an abundance of forage. But such is the present condition of\r\nChesapeake Bay that we cannot even get an advice boat across it with\r\nany certainty, much less adventure on transportation. Should, however,\r\nany interval happen, in which these articles may be withdrawn, we shall\r\ncertainly avail ourselves of it, and bring thence whatever we can.\r\n\r\nIf I have been rightly informed, the horses there are by no means such,\r\nas that the enemy could apply them to the purposes of cavalry. Some\r\nlarge enough for the draught may, perhaps, be found, but of these not\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                               RICHMOND, April 23, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On the 18th instant, the enemy came from Portsmouth up\r\nJames river, in considerable force, though their numbers are\r\nnot yet precisely known to us. They landed at Burwell's ferry,\r\nbelow Williamsburg, and also a short distance above the mouth of\r\nChickahomony. This latter circumstance obliged Colonel Innis, who\r\ncommanded a body of militia, stationed on that side the river to cover\r\nthe country from depredation, to retire upwards, lest he should be\r\nplaced between their two bodies. One of these entered Williamsburg\r\non the 20th, and the other proceeded to a ship-yard we had on\r\nChickahomony. What injury they did there, I am not yet informed. I\r\ntake for granted, they have burned an unfinished twenty-gun ship we had\r\nthere. Such of the stores, belonging to the yard as were movable, had\r\nbeen carried some miles higher up the river. Two small gallies also\r\nretired up the river. Whether by this, either the stores or gallies\r\nwere saved, is yet unknown. I am just informed, from a private hand,\r\nthat they left Williamsburg early yesterday morning. If this sudden\r\ndeparture was not in consequence of some circumstance of alarm unknown\r\nto us, their expedition to Williamsburg has been unaccountable. There\r\nwere no public stores at that place, but those which were necessary\r\nfor the daily subsistence of the men there. Where they mean to descend\r\nnext, the event alone can determine. Besides harassing our militia with\r\nthis kind of war, the taking them from their farms at the interesting\r\nseason of planting their corn, will have an unfortunate effect on the\r\ncrop of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nI have heard nothing certain of General Greene since the 6th instant,\r\nexcept that his head-quarters were on Little river on the 11th.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                  RICHMOND, May 9, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Since the last letter which I had the honor of addressing to your\r\nExcellency, the military movements in this State, except a very late\r\none, have scarcely merited communication.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, after leaving Williamsburg, came directly up James river and\r\nlanded at City Point, being the point of land on the southern point\r\nof the confluence of Appomattox and James rivers. They marched up to\r\nPetersburg, where they were received by Baron Steuben, with a body of\r\nmilitia somewhat under one thousand, who, though the enemy were two\r\nthousand and three hundred strong, disputed the ground very handsomely\r\ntwo hours, during which time the enemy gained only one mile, and\r\nthat by inches. Our troops were then ordered to retire over a bridge,\r\nwhich they did in perfectly good order. Our loss was between sixty and\r\nseventy, killed, wounded, and taken. The enemy's is unknown, but it\r\nmust be equal to ours; for their own honor they must confess this, as\r\nthey broke twice and run like sheep, till supported by fresh troops.\r\nAn inferiority in number obliged our force to withdraw about twelve\r\nmiles upwards, till more militia should be assembled. The enemy burned\r\nall the tobacco in the warehouses at Petersburg and its neighborhood.\r\nThey afterwards proceeded to Osborne's, where they did the same, and\r\nalso destroyed the residue of the public armed vessels, and several\r\nof private property, and then came to Manchester, which is on the hill\r\nopposite this place.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Major General Marquis Fayette having been advised of\r\nour danger, had, by forced marches, got here with his detachment of\r\nContinental troops; and reinforcements of militia having also come in,\r\nthe enemy, finding we were able to meet them on equal footing, thought\r\nproper to burn the warehouses and tobacco at Manchester, and retire\r\nto Warwick, where they did the same. Ill armed and untried militia,\r\nwho never before saw the face of an enemy, have, at times, during the\r\ncourse of this war, given occasions of exultation to our enemies, but\r\nthey afforded us, while at Warwick, a little satisfaction in the same\r\nway. Six or eight hundred of their picked men of light infantry, with\r\nGeneral Arnold at their head, having crossed the river from Warwick,\r\nfled from a patrole of sixteen horse, every man into his boat as he\r\ncould, some pushing North, some South, as their fears drove them. Their\r\nwhole force then proceeded to the Hundred, being the point of land\r\nwithin the confluence of the two rivers, embarked, and fell down the\r\nriver. Their foremost vessels had got below Burwell's ferry on the 6th\r\ninstant, when, on the arrival of a boat from Portsmouth, and a signal\r\ngiven, the whole crowded sail up the river again with a fair wind and\r\ntide, and came to anchor at Brandon; there six days' provision was\r\ndealt out to every man; they landed, and had orders to march an hour\r\nbefore day the next morning. We have not yet heard which way they went,\r\nor whether they have gone, but having, about the same time, received\r\nauthentic information that Lord Cornwallis had, on the 1st instant,\r\nadvanced from Wilmington half way to Halifax, we have no doubt,\r\nputting all circumstances together, that these two armies are forming\r\na junction.\r\n\r\nWe are strengthening our hands with militia, as far as arms, either\r\npublic or private, can be collected, but cannot arm a force which\r\nmay face the combined armies of the enemy. It will, therefore, be of\r\nvery great importance that General Wayne's forces be pressed on with\r\nthe utmost despatch. Arms and a naval force, however, are what must\r\nultimately save us. This movement of our enemies we consider as most\r\nperilous in its consequences.\r\n\r\nOur latest advices from General Greene were of the 26th ult., when\r\nhe was lying before Camden, the works and garrison of which were much\r\nstronger than he had expected to find them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE VIRGINIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                               IN COUNCIL, May 10, 1781.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--A small affair has taken place between the British\r\ncommanding officer in this State, General Phillips, and the Executive,\r\nof which, as he may endeavor to get rid of it through the medium of\r\nCongress, I think it necessary previously to apprise you.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott obtained permission from the Commandant at Charleston,\r\nfor vessels with necessary supplies to go from hence to them, but\r\ninstead of sending the original, sent only a copy of the permission\r\ntaken by his brigade major. I applied to General Phillips to supply\r\nthis omission by furnishing a passport for the vessel. Having just\r\nbefore taken great offence at a threat of retaliation in the treatment\r\nof prisoners, he enclosed his answer to my letter under this address,\r\n\"To Thomas Jefferson, Esq., American Governor of Virginia.\" I paused\r\non receiving the letter, and for some time would not open it; however,\r\nwhen the miserable condition of our brethren in Charleston occurred\r\nto me, I could not determine that they should be left without the\r\nnecessaries of life, while a punctilio should be discussing between\r\nthe British General and myself; and, knowing that I had an opportunity\r\nof returning the compliment to Mr. Phillips in a case perfectly\r\ncorresponding, I opened the letter.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after, I received, as I expected, the permission of the\r\nboard of war, for the British flag vessel then in Hampton Roads with\r\nclothing and refreshments, to proceed to Alexandria. I enclosed and\r\naddressed it, \"To William Phillips, Esq., commanding the British forces\r\nin the Commonwealth of Virginia.\" Personally knowing Phillips to be the\r\nproudest man of the proudest nation on earth, I well know he will not\r\nopen this letter; but having occasion, at the same time, to write to\r\nCaptain Gerlach, the flag-master, I informed him that the Convention\r\ntroops in this State should perish for want of necessaries, before any\r\nshould be carried to them through this State, till General Phillips\r\neither swallowed this pill of retaliation, or made an apology for his\r\nrudeness. And in this, should the matter come ultimately to Congress,\r\nwe hope for their support.\r\n\r\nHe has the less right to insist on the expedition of his flag, because\r\nhis letter, instead of enclosing a passport to expedite ours, contained\r\nonly an evasion of the application, by saying he had referred it to Sir\r\nHenry Clinton, and in the meantime, he has come up the river, and taken\r\nthe vessel with her loading, which we had chartered and prepared to\r\nsend to Charleston, and which wanted nothing but the passport to enable\r\nher to depart.\r\n\r\nI would further observe to you, that this gentleman's letters to\r\nthe Baron Steuben first, and afterwards to the Marquis Fayette, have\r\nbeen in a style so intolerably insolent and haughty, that both these\r\ngentlemen have been obliged to inform him, that if he thinks proper\r\nto address them again in the same spirit, all intercourse shall be\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect and esteem, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n                      Your most obedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                           CHARLOTTESVILLE, May 28,1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I make no doubt you will have heard, before this shall have\r\nthe honor of being presented to your Excellency, of the junction of\r\nLord Cornwallis with the force at Petersburg under Arnold, who had\r\nsucceeded to the command on the death of Major-general Phillips. I am\r\nnow advised that they have evacuated Petersburg, joined at Westover a\r\nreinforcement of two thousand men just arrived from New York, crossed\r\nJames river, and on the 26th instant, were three miles advanced on\r\ntheir way towards Richmond; at which place, Major-General the Marquis\r\nFayette lay with three thousand men, regulars and militia: these being\r\nthe whole number we could arm, until the arrival of the eleven hundred\r\narms from Rhode Island, which are, about this time, at the place where\r\nour public stores are deposited. The whole force of the enemy within\r\nthis State, from the best intelligence I have been able to get, is,\r\nI think, about seven thousand men, infantry and cavalry, including,\r\nalso, the small garrison left at Portsmouth. A number of privateers,\r\nwhich are constantly ravaging the shores of our rivers, prevent us\r\nfrom receiving any aid from the counties lying on navigable waters; and\r\npowerful operations meditated against our western frontier, by a joint\r\nforce of British and Indian savages, have, as your Excellency before\r\nknew, obliged us to embody between two and three thousand men in that\r\nquarter. Your Excellency will judge from this state of things, and from\r\nwhat you know of our country, what it may probably suffer during the\r\npresent campaign. Should the enemy be able to produce no opportunity\r\nof annihilating the Marquis's army, a small proportion of their force\r\nmay yet restrain his movements effectually while the greater part are\r\nemployed, in detachment, to waste an unarmed country, and lead the\r\nminds of the people to acquiesce under those events which they see no\r\nhuman power prepared to ward off. We are too far removed from the other\r\nscenes of war to say, whether the main force of the enemy be within\r\nthis State. But I suppose they cannot anywhere spare so great an army\r\nfor the operations of the field. Were it possible for this circumstance\r\nto justify in your Excellency a determination to lend us your personal\r\naid, it is evident, from the universal voice, that the presence of\r\ntheir beloved countryman, whose talents have so long been successfully\r\nemployed in establishing the freedom of kindred States, to whose person\r\nthey have still flattered themselves they retained some right, and have\r\never looked up, as their dernier resort in distress, would restore\r\nfull confidence of salvation to our citizens, and would render them\r\nequal to whatever is not impossible. I cannot undertake to foresee and\r\nobviate the difficulties which lie in the way of such a resolution.\r\nThe whole subject is before you, of which I see only detached parts;\r\nand your judgment will be formed on a view of the whole. Should the\r\ndanger of this State and its consequence to the Union, be such, as to\r\nrender it best for the whole that you should repair to its assistance,\r\nthe difficulty would then be, how to keep men out of the field. I have\r\nundertaken to hint this matter to your Excellency, not only on my own\r\nsense of its importance to us, but at the solicitations of many members\r\nof weight in our legislature, which has not yet assembled to speak\r\ntheir own desires.\r\n\r\nA few days will bring to me that relief which the constitution has\r\nprepared for those oppressed with the labors of my office, and a long\r\ndeclared resolution of relinquishing it to abler hands, has prepared\r\nmy way for retirement to a private station: still, as an individual,\r\nI should feel the comfortable effects of your presence, and have\r\n(what I thought could not have been) an additional motive for that\r\ngratitude, esteem, and respect, with which I have the honor to be, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, August 4, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am much obliged by the trouble you took in forwarding to me\r\nthe letter of his Excellency, the President of Congress. It found me\r\nin Bedford, an hundred miles southward of this, where I was confined\r\ntill within these few days, by an unfortunate fall from my horse. This\r\nhas occasioned the delay of the answer which I now take the liberty of\r\nenclosing to you, as the confidential channel of conveyance, pointed\r\nout by the President.\r\n\r\nI thank you also for your kind sentiments and friendly offer on\r\nthe occasion, which, that I cannot avail myself of, has given me\r\nmore mortification than almost any occurrence of my life. I lose an\r\nopportunity, the only one I ever had, and perhaps ever shall have,\r\nof combining public service with private gratification. Of seeing\r\ncountries whose improvements in science, in arts, and in civilization,\r\nit has been my fortune to admire at a distance, but never to see, and\r\nat the same time of lending some aid to a cause, which has been handed\r\non from its first organization to its present stage, by every effort\r\nof which my poor faculties were capable. These, however, have not\r\nbeen such as to give satisfaction to some of my countrymen, and it has\r\nbecome necessary for me to remain in the State till a later period in\r\nthe present year, than is consistent with an acceptance of what has\r\nbeen offered me.[102] Declining higher objects, therefore, my only one\r\nmust be to show that suggestion and fact are different things, and that\r\npublic misfortune may be produced as well by public poverty and private\r\ndisobedience to the laws, as by the misconduct of public servants.[103]\r\nThe independence of private life under the protection of republican\r\nlaws will, I hope, yield me the happiness from which no slave is so\r\nremote as the minister of a commonwealth. From motives of private\r\nesteem as well as public gratitude, I shall pray it to be your lot in\r\nevery line of life, as no one can with more truth subscribe himself\r\nwith the highest regard and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDMUND RANDOLPH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                         MONTICELLO, September 16, 1781.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received your letter of the 7th instant. That,\r\nmentioned to have been sent by the preceding post, has not come to\r\nhand, nor two others, which Mrs. Randolph informs me you wrote before\r\nyou left Virginia, nor indeed any others, should you have been so kind\r\nas to have written any others. When I received the first letter from\r\nthe President of Congress, enclosing their resolution, and mentioning\r\nthe necessity of an expeditious departure, my determination to attend\r\nat the next session of the Assembly offered a ready and insuperable\r\nobstacle to my accepting of that appointment, and left me under no\r\nnecessity of deliberating with myself whether, that objection being\r\nremoved, any other considerations might prevent my undertaking it. I\r\nfind there are many, and must, therefore, decline it altogether. Were\r\nit possible for me to determine again to enter into public business,\r\nthere is no appointment whatever which would have been so agreeable\r\nto me. But I have taken my final leave of everything of that nature.\r\nI have retired to my farm, my family and books, from which I think\r\nnothing will evermore separate me. A desire to leave public office,\r\nwith a reputation not more blotted than it has deserved, will oblige me\r\nto emerge at the next session of our Assembly, and perhaps to accept of\r\na seat in it. But as I go with a single object, I shall withdraw when\r\nthat shall be accomplished. I should have thought that North Carolina,\r\nrescued from the hands of Britain, Georgia and almost the whole of\r\nSouth Carolina recovered, would have been sufficiently humiliating to\r\ninduce them to treat with us. If this will not do, I hope the stroke\r\nis now hanging over them which will satisfy them that their views of\r\nSouthern conquests are likely to be as visionary as those of Northern.\r\nI think it impossible Lord Cornwallis should escape. Mrs. Randolph will\r\nbe able to give you all the news on this subject, as soon as you shall\r\nbe able to release her from others. I am, with much esteem, dear Sir,\r\nyour friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                         MONTICELLO, October 28th, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I hope it will not be unacceptable to your Excellency to receive\r\nthe congratulations of a private individual on your return to your\r\nnative country, and, above all things, on the important success which\r\nhas attended it.[104] Great as this has been, however, it can scarcely\r\nadd to the affection with which we have looked up to you. And if,\r\nin the minds of any, the motives of gratitude to our good allies\r\nwere not sufficiently apparent, the part they have borne in this\r\naction must amply evince them. Notwithstanding the state of perpetual\r\ndecrepitude to which I am unfortunately reduced, I should certainly\r\nhave done myself the honor of paying my respects to you personally;\r\nbut I apprehend these visits, which are meant by us as marks of our\r\nattachment to you, must interfere with the regulations of a camp, and\r\nbe particularly inconvenient to one whose time is too precious to be\r\nwasted in ceremony.\r\n\r\nI beg you to believe me among the sincerest of those who subscribe\r\nthemselves, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES\r\n\r\n                                          RICHMOND, December 14th, 1781.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received your friendly letters of August 2d and\r\nNovember 15th, and some of the gentlemen to whom you wished them to\r\nbe communicated not being here, I have taken the liberty of handing\r\nthem to some others, so as to answer the spirit of your wish. It seems\r\nlikely to end, as I ever expected it would, in a final acknowledgment\r\nthat good dispositions and arrangements will not do without a certain\r\ndegree of bravery and discipline in those who are to carry them into\r\nexecution. This, the men whom you commanded, or the greater part of\r\nthem at least, unfortunately wanted on that particular occasion.\r\n\r\nI have not a doubt but that, on a fair enquiry, the returning justice\r\nof your countrymen will remind them of Saratoga, and induce them to\r\nrecognize your merits. My future plan of life scarcely admits a hope\r\nof my having the pleasure of seeing you at your seat; yet I assuredly\r\nshall do it should it ever lie within my power, and am assured that\r\nMrs. Jefferson will join me in sincere thanks for your kind sentiments\r\nand invitation, and in expressions of equal esteem for Mrs. Gates and\r\nyourself, and in a certain hope that, should any circumstance lead you\r\nwithin our reach, you will make us happy by your company at Monticello.\r\nWe have no news to communicate. That the Assembly does little, does not\r\ncome under that description.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem, dear sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, March 24th, 1782.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received from you two several favors, on the subject\r\nof the designs against the territorial rights of Virginia.[105] I\r\nnever before could comprehend on what principle our rights to the\r\nwestern country could be denied, which would not, at the same time,\r\nsubvert the right of all the States to the whole of their territory.\r\nWhat objections may be founded on the charter of New York, I cannot\r\nsay, having never seen that charter, nor been able to get a copy of\r\nit in this country. I had thought to have seized the first leisure\r\non my return from the last Assembly, to have considered and stated\r\nour rights, and to have communicated to our delegates, or perhaps to\r\nthe public, so much as I could trace, and expected to have derived\r\nsome assistance from ancient MSS., which I have been able to collect.\r\nThese, with my other papers and books, however, had been removed to\r\nAugusta to be out of danger from the enemy, and have not yet been\r\nbrought back. The ground on which I now find the question to be\r\nbottomed is so unknown to me that it is out of my power to say anything\r\non the subject. Should it be practicable for me to procure a copy\r\nof the charter of New York, I shall probably think on it, and would\r\ncheerfully communicate to you whatever could occur to me worth your\r\nnotice. But this will probably be much too late to be of any service\r\nbefore Congress, who doubtless will decide, ere long, on the subject.\r\nI sincerely wish their decision may tend to the preservation of peace.\r\nIf I am not totally deceived in the determination of this country,\r\nthe decision of Congress, if unfavorable, will not close the question.\r\nI suppose some people on the western waters, who are ambitious to be\r\nGovernors, &c., will urge a separation by authority of Congress. But\r\nthe bulk of the people westward are already thrown into great ferment\r\nby the report of what is proposed, to which I think they will not\r\nsubmit. This separation is unacceptable to us in form only, and not\r\nin substance. On the contrary, I may safely say it is desired by the\r\neastern part of our country whenever their western brethren shall think\r\nthemselves able to stand alone. In the meantime, on the petition of\r\nthe western counties, a plan is digesting for rendering their access to\r\ngovernment more easy. I trouble you with the enclosed to Mons. Marbois.\r\nI had the pleasure of hearing that your father and family were all\r\nwell yesterday, by your brother, who is about to study the law in my\r\nneighborhood. I shall always be glad to hear from you, and, if it be\r\npossible for me, retired from public business, to find anything worth\r\nyour notice, I shall communicate it with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nI am with sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                            RICHMOND, 11th of May, 1782.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As I so lately wrote you by Mr. Short, and have since\r\ndaily expected to see you here, I did not propose writing to you till\r\nafter I should have that pleasure; but as I begin to fear you will not\r\nabate that firmness and decision which you have frequently shown in\r\nthe service of your country, even upon this occasion, and as I have\r\nhad an opportunity since I last wrote of being better informed of the\r\nsentiments of those whom I know you put the greatest value on, I think\r\nit my duty to make you acquainted therewith. It is publicly said here,\r\nthat the people of your country informed you that they had frequently\r\nelected you in times of less difficulty and danger than the present to\r\nplease you; but that now they had called you forth into public office\r\nto serve themselves. This is a language which has been often used in\r\nmy presence; and you will readily conceive that, as it furnishes those\r\nwho argue on the fundamental maxims of a Republican government with\r\nample field for declamation, the conclusion has always been, that\r\nyou should not decline the service of your country. The present is\r\ngenerally conceived to be an important era, which, of course, makes\r\nyour attendance particularly necessary. And as I have taken the liberty\r\nto give you the public opinion and desire upon this occasion, and as\r\nI am warmly interested in whatever concerns the public interest or\r\nhas relation to you, it will be necessary to add, it is earnestly the\r\ndesire of, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n               Your sincere friend and obedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, May 20th, 1782.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have been gratified with your two favors of the 6th and\r\n11th inst. It gives me pleasure that your county has been wise enough\r\nto enlist your talent into their service. I am much obliged by the\r\nkind wishes you express of seeing me also in Richmond, and am always\r\nmortified when anything is expected from me which I cannot fulfill, and\r\nmore especially if it relate to the public service. Before I ventured\r\nto declare to my countrymen my determination to retire from public\r\nemployment, I examined well my heart to know whether it were thoroughly\r\ncured of every principle of political ambition, whether no lurking\r\nparticle remained which might leave me uneasy, when reduced within\r\nthe limits of mere private life. I became satisfied that every fibre\r\nof that passion was thoroughly eradicated. I examined also, in other\r\nviews, my right to withdraw. I considered that I had been thirteen\r\nyears engaged in public service--that, during that time, I had so\r\ntotally abandoned all attention to my private affairs as to permit them\r\nto run into great disorder and ruin--that I had now a family advanced\r\nto years which require my attention and instruction--that, to these,\r\nwas added the hopeful offspring of a deceased friend, whose memory\r\nmust be forever dear to me, and who have no other reliance for being\r\nrendered useful to themselves or their country--that by a constant\r\nsacrifice of time, labor, parental and friendly duties, I had, so far\r\nfrom gaining the affection of my countrymen, which was the only reward\r\nI ever asked or could have felt, even lost the small estimation I had\r\nbefore possessed.\r\n\r\nThat, however I might have comforted myself under the disapprobation\r\nof the well-meaning but uninformed people, yet, that of their\r\nrepresentatives was a shock on which I had not calculated. That this,\r\nindeed, had been followed by an exculpatory declaration. But, in the\r\nmeantime, I had been suspected in the eyes of the world, without the\r\nleast hint then or afterwards being made public, which might restrain\r\nthem from supposing that I stood arraigned for treason of the heart,\r\nand not merely weakness of the mind; and I felt that these injuries,\r\nfor such they have been since acknowledged, had inflicted a wound on my\r\nspirit which will only be cured by the all-healing grave. If reason and\r\ninclination unite in justifying my retirement, the laws of my country\r\nare equally in favor of it. Whether the State may command the political\r\nservices of all its members to an indefinite extent, or, if these be\r\namong the rights never wholly ceded to the public power, is a question\r\nwhich I do not find expressly decided in England. Obiter dictums on\r\nthe subject I have indeed met with, but the complexion of the times\r\nin which these have dropped would generally answer them. Besides that,\r\nthis species of authority is not acknowledged in our possession.\r\n\r\nIn this country, however, since the present government has been\r\nestablished, the point has been settled by uniform, pointed and\r\nmultiplied precedents. Offices of every kind, and given by every power,\r\nhave been daily and hourly declined and resigned from the Declaration\r\nof Independence to this moment. The General Assembly has accepted\r\nthese without discrimination of office, and without ever questioning\r\nthem in point of right. If the difference between the office of a\r\ndelegate and any other could ever have been supposed, yet in the case\r\nof Mr. Thompson Mason, who declined the office of delegate, and was\r\npermitted so to do by the House, that supposition has been proved\r\nto be groundless. But, indeed, no such distinction of offices can be\r\nadmitted. Reason, and the opinions of the lawyers, putting all on a\r\nfooting as to this question, and so giving to the delegate the aid\r\nof all the precedents of the refusal of other offices. The law then\r\ndoes not warrant the assumption of such a power by the State over its\r\nmembers. For if it does, where is that law? nor yet does reason. For\r\nthough I will admit that this does subject every individual, if called\r\non, to an equal tour of political duty, yet it can never go so far as\r\nto submit to it his whole existence. If we are made in some degree\r\nfor others, yet, in a greater, are we made for ourselves. It were\r\ncontrary to feeling, and indeed ridiculous to suppose that a man had\r\nless rights in himself than one of his neighbors, or indeed all of them\r\nput together. This would be slavery, and not that liberty which the\r\nbill of rights has made inviolable, and for the preservation of which\r\nour government has been charged. Nothing could so completely divest us\r\nof that liberty as the establishment of the opinion, that the State\r\nhas a perpetual right to the services of all its members. This, to\r\nmen of certain ways of thinking, would be to annihilate the blessings\r\nof existence, and to contradict the Giver of life, who gave it for\r\nhappiness and not for wretchedness. And certainly, to such it were\r\nbetter that they had never been born. However, with these, I may think\r\npublic service and private misery inseparably linked together, I have\r\nnot the vanity to count myself among those whom the State would think\r\nworth oppressing with perpetual service. I have received a sufficient\r\nmemento to the contrary. I am persuaded that, having hitherto dedicated\r\nto them the whole of the active and useful part of my life, I shall be\r\npermitted to pass the rest in mental quiet. I hope, too, that I did\r\nnot mistake modes any more than the matter of right when I preferred\r\na simple act of renunciation, to the taking sanctuary under those\r\ndisqualifications (provided by the law for other purposes indeed but)\r\naffording asylum also for rest to the wearied. I dare say you did not\r\nexpect by the few words you dropped on the right of renunciation to\r\nexpose yourself to the fatigue of so long a letter, but I wished you\r\nto see that, if I had done wrong, I had been betrayed by a semblance\r\nof right at least. I take the liberty of enclosing to you a letter\r\nfor General Chattellux, for which you will readily find means of\r\nconveyance. But I mean to give you more trouble with the one to Pelham,\r\nwho lives in the neighborhood of Manchester, and to ask the favor of\r\nyou to send it by your servant--express--which I am in hopes may be\r\ndone without absenting him from your person, but during those hours in\r\nwhich you will be engaged in the house. I am anxious that it should be\r\nreceived immediately. * * * * * * It will give me great pleasure to see\r\nyou here whenever you can favor us with your company. You will find me\r\nstill busy, but in lighter occupations. But in these and all others you\r\nwill find me to retain a due sense of your friendship, and to be, with\r\nsincere esteem, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                        CHESTERFIELD, November 26, 1782.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received yesterday the letter with which you have been pleased\r\nto honor me, enclosing the resolution of Congress of the 12th instant,\r\nrenewing my appointment as one of their ministers plenipotentiary for\r\nnegotiating a peace--and beg leave, through you, to return my sincere\r\nthanks to that august body, for the confidence they are pleased to\r\nrepose in me, and to tender the same to yourself for the obliging\r\nmanner in which you have notified it.[106] I will employ in this\r\narduous charge, with diligence and integrity, the best of my poor\r\ntalents, which I am conscious are far short of what it requires. This,\r\nI hope, will ensure to me from Congress a kind construction of all my\r\ntransactions. And it gives me no small pleasure, that my communications\r\nwill pass through the hands of a gentleman with whom I have acted in\r\nthe earlier stages of this contest, and whose candor and discernment\r\nI had the good fortune then to approve and esteem. Your letter finds\r\nme at a distance from home, attending my family under inoculation.\r\nThis will add to the delay which the arrangements of my particular\r\naffairs would necessarily occasion. I shall lose no moment, however,\r\nin preparing for my departure, and shall hope to pay my respects to\r\nCongress and yourself at sometime between the 20th and the last of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very great esteem and respect, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CHEVALIER DE CHATTELLUX.\r\n\r\n                                             AMPHILL, November 26, 1782.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your friendly letters of ---- and June 30th, but\r\nthe latter not till the 17th of October. It found me a little emerging\r\nfrom the stupor of mind which had rendered me as dead to the world\r\nas was she whose loss occasioned it.[107] Your letter recalled to my\r\nmemory that there were persons still living of much value to me. If\r\nyou should have thought me remiss in not testifying to you sooner, how\r\ndeeply I had been impressed with your worth in the little time I had\r\nthe happiness of being with you, you will, I am sure, ascribe it to its\r\ntrue cause, the state of dreadful suspense in which I have been kept\r\nall the summer, and the catastrophe which closed it.\r\n\r\nBefore that event, my scheme of life had been determined. I had folded\r\nmyself in the arms of retirement, and rested all prospects of future\r\nhappiness on domestic and literary objects. A single event wiped\r\naway all my plans, and left me a blank which I had not the spirits\r\nto fill up. In this state of mind an appointment from Congress found\r\nme, requiring me to cross the Atlantic. And that temptation might be\r\nadded to duty, I was informed, at the same time, from his Excellency\r\nthe Chevalier de Luzerne, that a vessel of force would be sailing\r\nabout the middle of December in which you would be passing to France.\r\nI accepted the appointment, and my only object now is, to so hasten\r\nover those obstacles which would retard my departure, as to be ready to\r\njoin you in your voyage--fondly measuring your affection by my own, and\r\npresuming your consent. It is not certain that I can, by any exertion,\r\nbe in Philadelphia by the middle of December--the contrary is most\r\nprobable. But hoping it will not be much later, and counting on those\r\nprocrastinations which usually attend the departure of vessels of size,\r\nI have hopes of being with you in time. This will give me full leisure\r\nto learn the result of your observations on the natural bridge, to\r\ncommunicate to you my answers to the enquiries of Monsieur de Marbois,\r\nto receive edification from you on these and other subjects of science;\r\nconsidering chess, too, as a matter of science. Should I be able to get\r\nout in tolerable time, and any extraordinary delays attend the sailing\r\nof the vessel, I shall certainly do myself the honor of waiting on his\r\nExcellency the Count de Rochambeau, at his head-quarters, and assuring\r\nhim in person of my high respect and esteem for him--an object of which\r\nI have never lost sight. To yourself, I am unable to express the warmth\r\nof those sentiments of friendship and attachment with which I have the\r\nhonour to be, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n              Your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. STEPTOE.\r\n\r\n                                                      November 26, 1782.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received in August your favor, wherein you give me hopes\r\nof being able to procure for me some of the big bones. I should be\r\nunfaithful to my own feeling, were I not to express to you how much\r\nI am obliged by your attention to the requests I made you on that\r\nsubject. A specimen of each of the several species of bones now to\r\nbe found, is to me the most desirable objects in natural history.\r\nAnd there is no expense of package or of safe transportation which\r\nI will not gladly reimburse, to procure them safely. Elk horns of\r\nvery extraordinary size, or anything else uncommon, would be very\r\nacceptable. You will hear of my going to Europe, but my trip there\r\nwill be short. I mention this, lest you should hesitate forwarding\r\nany curiosities to me. New London in Bedford, Staunton in Augusta,\r\nor Frederick County, are places from whence I can surely get them.\r\nAny observations of your own on the subject of the big bones or\r\ntheir history, or on anything else in the western country, will come\r\nacceptably to me, because I know you see the works of nature in the\r\ngreat and not merely in detail. Descriptions of animals, vegetables,\r\nminerals, or other curious things; notes as to the Indians' information\r\nof the country between the Mississippi and waters of the South Sea,\r\n&c., &c., will strike your mind as worthy being communicated. I wish\r\nyou had more time to pay attention to them. I perceive by your letter,\r\nyou are not unapprized that your services to your country have not\r\nmade due impression on every mind. That you have enemies, you must\r\nnot doubt, when you reflect that you have made yourself eminent. If\r\nyou meant to escape malice, you should have confined yourself within\r\nthe sleepy line of regular duty. When you transgressed this, and\r\nenterprised deeds which will hand down your name with honor to future\r\ntimes, you made yourself a mark for envy and malice to shoot at. Of\r\nthese there is enough, you know, both in and out of office. I was not\r\na little surprised, however, to find one person hostile to you, as far\r\nas he has personal courage to show hostility to any man. Who he is, you\r\nwill probably have heard, or may know him by this description--as being\r\nall tongue without either head or heart. In the variety of his crooked\r\nschemes, however, his interest may probably veer about, so as to put it\r\nin your power to be useful to him. In which case, he certainly will be\r\nyour friend again, if you want him. That you may long continue a fit\r\nobject for his enmity, and for that of every person of his complexion\r\nin the State, which I know can only be by your continuing to do good to\r\nyour country and to acquire honor to yourself, is the earnest prayer of\r\none who subscribes himself, with great truth and sincerity, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n                        Your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                          AMPHILL, IN CHESTERFIELD, November 26th, 1782.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor by Colonel Basset is not yet come to hand. The\r\nintimation through the attorney, I received the day before Colonel\r\nBland's arrival, by whom I am honored with yours of the 14th inst.\r\nIt finds me at this place attending my family under inoculation. This\r\nwill of course retard those arrangements of my domestic affairs, which\r\nwill of themselves take time and cannot be made but at home. I shall\r\nlose no time, however, in preparing for my departure. And from the\r\ncalculation I am at present enabled to make, I suppose I cannot be in\r\nPhiladelphia before the 20th of December, and that possibly it may be\r\nthe last of that month. Some days I must certainly pass there, as I\r\ncould not propose to jump into the midst of a negotiation without a\r\nsingle article of previous information. From these data, you will be\r\nenabled to judge of the chance of availing myself of his Excellency,\r\nthe Chevalier de Luzerne's, kind offers, to whom I beg you to present\r\nmy thanks for his friendly attention, and let him know I shall use\r\nmy best endeavors to be in time for the departure of his frigate.\r\nNo circumstances of a private nature could induce me to hasten over\r\nthe several obstacles to my departure more unremitting than the hope\r\nof having the Chevalier de Chattellux as a companion in my voyage.\r\nA previous acquaintance with his worth and abilities, had impressed\r\nme with an affection for him which, under the then prospect of never\r\nseeing him again, was perhaps imprudent.\r\n\r\nI am with very sincere esteem, dear Sir, your very affectionate friend,\r\nand humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                        PHILADELPHIA, January 22d, 1783.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Having lately received a call from Congress to pass the Atlantic\r\nin the character of their minister for negotiating peace, I cannot\r\nleave the continent without separating myself for a moment from the\r\ngeneral gratitude of my country, to offer my individual tribute to your\r\nExcellency for all you have suffered and all you have effected for us.\r\nWere I to indulge myself in those warm effusions which this subject\r\nforever prompts, they would wear an appearance of adulation very\r\nforeign to my nature; for such is become the prostitution of language\r\nthat sincerity has no longer distinct terms in which to express her\r\nown truths. Should you give me occasion, during the short mission on\r\nwhich I go, to render you any service beyond the water, I shall, for\r\na proof of my gratitude, appeal from language to the zeal with which\r\nI shall embrace it. The negotiations to which I am joined may perhaps\r\nbe protracted beyond our present expectations, in which case, though I\r\nknow you must receive much better intelligence from the gentlemen whose\r\nresidence there has brought them into a more intimate acquaintance with\r\nthe characters and views of the European courts, yet I shall certainly\r\npresume to add my mite, should it only serve to convince you of the\r\nwarmth of those sentiments of respect and esteem with which I have the\r\nhonor to be, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE, MINISTER OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n                                          BALTIMORE, February 7th, 1783.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Chevalier de Ville Brun was so kind as to communicate to me\r\nyesterday your Excellency's letter to him of January, together with the\r\nintelligence therein referred to. I feel myself bound to return you my\r\nthanks, for your orders to the Guadeloupe frigate to receive me, if I\r\nshould think a passage should be hazarded under present circumstances.\r\nAccording to this information (which is the most worthy of credit of\r\nany we have received here), it would seem that our capture would be\r\nunavoidable were we to go out now. This, therefore, is a risk to which\r\nI cannot think of exposing his Majesty's vessel and subjects; however\r\nI might be disposed to encounter personal hazards, from my anxiety\r\nto execute, with all the promptitude in my power, a service which has\r\nbeen assigned to me. I shall therefore wait with patience the arrival\r\nof the moment when the Chevalier de Ville Brun shall be of opinion\r\nthat the one or the other of the vessels may venture out without any\r\ngreater risk than he shall think proportioned to her proper object,\r\nindependently of mine. It has been suggested to me this evening, that\r\nperhaps their safe departure might be greatly forwarded by their\r\nfalling down to York, or Hampton, there to be ready at a moment's\r\nwarning, to avail themselves of those favorable circumstances which the\r\npresent season sometimes offers.\r\n\r\nBut of this, yourself will be the proper judge. I cannot close my\r\nletter without expressing to you my obligations to the Chevalier\r\nde Ville Brun for the particular attention he has shown to my\r\naccommodation on board his ship. The apartments he has had constructed\r\nfor me are ample and commodious, and his politeness and deportment as\r\nan officer are an agreeable presage of everything that shall depend on\r\nhim. I have delivered to him the two large packets you were pleased\r\nto put into my hands, and he will dispose of them according to your\r\norders.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest sentiments of esteem, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n                                            BALTIMORE, February 7, 1783.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I arrived here on the 30th of the last month, and had a short\r\ninterview the same evening with the Chevalier de Ville Brun, commander\r\nof the Ramilies. There appeared at that time little apprehension but\r\nthat we might sail in a few days, but we were not very particular in\r\nour conference, as we expected to see each other again. The severity of\r\nthe cold, however, which commenced that night, obliged the Chevalier\r\nde Ville Brun to fall twelve miles below this place, and excluded\r\nall correspondence with him till yesterday, when I found means to\r\nget through the ice on board his ship. He then communicated to me,\r\nby direction of his Excellency, the minister of France, intelligence\r\nas to the number and force of the cruisers now actually watching the\r\ncapes of the Chesapeake. I must acknowledge that the appearances are\r\nsuch as to render a capture certain were we to hazard it. The minister\r\nwas pleased at the same time to submit the Guadeloupe to my wishes, if\r\nI chose to adventure. I take the liberty of troubling you with a copy\r\nof my letter to him on that subject. I should certainly be disposed\r\nto run very considerable risks myself to effect my passage; but should\r\nthink it an unfortunate introduction to an ally, who has already done\r\nso much for us, were I to add to his losses and disbursements that of\r\na valuable ship and crew. I wish that the present delay offered some\r\nperiod less distant than the lassitude of an avaricious enemy to watch\r\nfor prey. Perhaps you may be able to put me on some more expeditious\r\nmode of passage than the one under which I am acquiescing at present. I\r\nshall be much pleased to adopt any such which may come recommended from\r\nyou, without regard to personal risk or trouble. In the meantime, any\r\nintelligence which you can collect and will be pleased to give me as to\r\nthe state of our coast, will be of utility in determining whether and\r\nwhen we shall depart hence.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be with very great esteem and respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. Your letter of the 31st ultimo came safely to hand with the\r\npacket to Mr. Adams accompanying it.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON TO THE HONORABLE THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                          NEWBURGH, 10th February, 1783.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have been honored with your favor of 22d of January from\r\nPhiladelphia. I feel myself much flattered by your kind remembrance\r\nof me in the hour of your departure from this continent, for the\r\nfavorable sentiments you are pleased to entertain of my services for\r\nthis our common country. To merit the approbation of good and virtuous\r\nmen is the height of my ambition, and will be a full compensation\r\nfor all my toils and sufferings in the long and painful contest in\r\nwhich we have been engaged. It gave me great pleasure to hear that the\r\ncall upon you from Congress to pass the Atlantic in the character of\r\none of their ministers for negotiating peace had been repeated; but\r\nI hope you will have found the business already done. The speech of\r\nhis Britannic Majesty is strongly indicative of the olive branch; and\r\nyet, as he observes, unforseen events may place it out of reach. At\r\npresent, the prospect of peace absorbs, or seems to do so, every other\r\nconsideration among us; and would, it is to be feared, leave us in a\r\nvery unprepared state to continue the war, if the negotiations at Paris\r\nshould terminate otherwise than in a general pacification. But I will\r\nhope that it is the dearth of other news that fills the mouths of every\r\nperson with peace, while their minds are employed in contemplating on\r\nthe means of prosecuting the war, if necessity should drive us to it.\r\nYou will please to accept my grateful thanks for your obliging offer\r\nof services during your stay in France. To hear from you frequently\r\nwill be an honor and very great satisfaction to, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                      PHILADELPHIA, 14th February, 1783.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have delayed in answering your favor of the 7th instant until\r\nI could obtain the sense of Congress on the matter it contains.\r\nI conceive it hardly possible, while the British cruisers retain\r\ntheir present station, for you to elude their vigilance in either\r\nof the ships offered to your choice. This, concurring with the late\r\nadvices from England, has induced Congress to pass the enclosed\r\nresolution.[108] We have reason to conjecture that peace is already\r\nconcluded; whether it is or not, a few days will determine. I transmit\r\nthe speech of his Britannic Majesty, which, with what you already know\r\nof the state of our negotiations, will enable you to form your opinion\r\non the same ground that we do. I have the honor to be, Sir, with great\r\nrespect and esteem, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO R. R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                           BALTIMORE, February 14, 1783.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I apprised you in my former letter of the causes which had\r\nso long delayed my departure. These still continue. I have this\r\nmoment received a printed copy of his British Majesty's speech to\r\nhis Parliament, by which we learn that the preliminaries between\r\nGreat Britain and America, among which is one for the acknowledgment\r\nof our independence, have been provisionally agreed to on his part.\r\nThat the negotiations with the other powers at war were considerably\r\nadvanced, and that he hoped, in a very short time, they would end\r\nin terms of pacification. As considerable progress has been made in\r\nthe negotiations for peace since the appointment with which Congress\r\nwere pleased to honor me, it may have become doubtful whether any\r\ncommunications I could make or any assistance I could yield to the very\r\nable gentlemen in whose hands the business already is, would compensate\r\nthe expense of prosecuting my voyage to Europe. I therefore beg leave\r\nthrough you, Sir, to assure Congress that I desire this question to be\r\nas open to them now as it was on the day of my appointment, and that I\r\nhave not a wish either to go or to stay. They will be pleased to weigh\r\nthe economy of the one measure against the chance which the other may\r\noffer of my arriving in such time as that any communications which have\r\nbeen confided to me may produce effect on definitive articles. I shall\r\ncontinue here for the prosecution of my voyage, under the orders before\r\nreceived, or for its discontinuance, should that be more eligible to\r\nCongress, and be signified at any moment before my departure. I have\r\nthe honor to be, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                        PHILADELPHIA, February 18, 1783.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I was yesterday honored with your favor of the 14th, which\r\nI shall lay before Congress this morning. As you have by this time\r\nreceived their resolution which I had the honor to send you by the last\r\npost, and again enclosed, you will be relieved in some measure from\r\nyour embarrassments, though not entirely of your suspense with respect\r\nto their final determination. But that cannot be long doubtful, since\r\nthe negotiations have certainly arrived at such a crisis as either to\r\nterminate soon in a peace or a total rupture. In the latter case, you\r\nwill necessarily be obliged to proceed on your voyage, as Congress\r\nseems anxious to avail themselves of your abilities and information\r\nin the negotiations, unless they are fully assured that a speedy peace\r\nwill preclude them from that advantage.\r\n\r\nI enclose a paper which contains all that we have yet received on that\r\ninteresting subject. It may, perhaps, be difficult to account for our\r\nministers having signed before those of France. But if this letter is\r\ngenuine, it serves, when compared with their instructions, to prove\r\nthat the terms of peace are acceptable to us and not disagreeable to\r\nFrance. I have the honor to be, Sir, with great respect and esteem,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. R. R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, March 13, 1783.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Supposing the despatches received by the Washington, may have\r\nenabled Congress to decide on the expediency of continuing, or of\r\ncountermanding my mission to Europe, I take the liberty of expressing\r\nto you the satisfaction it will give me to receive their ultimate\r\nwill, so soon as other business will permit them to revert to this\r\nsubject.[109] I have the honor, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                         _Philadelphia_, April 11, 1783.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In a letter which I did myself the honor of writing to you\r\nby the Chevalier de Chattellux, I informed you of my being at this\r\nplace, with the intention of joining you in Paris. But the uncommon\r\nvigilance of the enemy's cruisers, immediately after the departure of\r\nthe French fleet, deterred every vessel from attempting to go out. The\r\narrival of the preliminaries soon after showed the impropriety of my\r\nproceeding, and I am just now setting out on my return to Virginia. I\r\ncannot, however, take my departure, without paying to yourself and your\r\nworthy colleague my homage for the good work you have completed for\r\nus, and congratulating you on the singular happiness of having borne\r\nso distinguished a part both in the earliest and latest transactions\r\nof this revolution. The terms obtained for us are indeed great, and\r\nare so deemed by your country--a few ill-designing debtors excepted.\r\nI am in hopes you will continue at some one of the European courts\r\nmost agreeable to yourself, that we may still have the benefit of your\r\ntalents. I took the liberty in my letter of suggesting a wish that you\r\nwould be so kind as to engage lodgings for me. Should you have given\r\nyourself this trouble, I beg leave to return you my thanks, and to ask\r\nthe favor of you to communicate the amount of their hire to Mr. Robert\r\nMorris, of this city, who will immediately remit it to you, as I lodge\r\nmoney in his hands for this purpose. Accept my warmest wishes for your\r\nhappiness, and be assured of the sincerity with which I have the honor\r\nto be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. I beg to be affectionately remembered to Dr. F. and Mr. A., if\r\nthey be still with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                              ANNAPOLIS, April 16, 1784.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favor of April 8th, by Colonel Harrison. The\r\nsubject of it is interesting, and, so far as you have stood connected\r\nwith it, has been matter of anxiety to me; because, whatever may be\r\nthe ultimate fate of the institution of the Cincinnati, in its course,\r\nit draws to it some degree of disapprobation. I have wished to see\r\nyou standing on ground separated from it, and that the character which\r\nwill be handed to future ages at the head of our Revolution, may, in\r\nno instance, be compromitted in subordinate altercations. The subject\r\nhas been at the point of my pen in every letter I have written to\r\nyou, but has been still restrained by the reflection that you had\r\namong your friends more able counsellors, and, in yourself, one abler\r\nthan them all. Your letter has now rendered a duty what was before a\r\ndesire, and I cannot better merit your confidence than by a full and\r\nfree communication of facts and sentiments, as far as they have come\r\nwithin my observation. When the army was about to be disbanded, and\r\nthe officers to take final leave, perhaps never again to meet, it\r\nwas natural for men who had accompanied each other through so many\r\nscenes of hardship, of difficulty, and danger, who, in a variety of\r\ninstances, must have been rendered mutually dear by those aids and\r\ngood offices, to which their situations had given occasion; it was\r\nnatural, I say, for these to seize with fondness any proposition\r\nwhich promised to bring them together again, at certain and regular\r\nperiods. And this, I take for granted, was the origin and object of\r\nthis institution; and I have no suspicion that they foresaw, much less\r\nintended, those mischiefs which exist, perhaps in the forebodings of\r\npoliticians only. I doubt, however, whether, in its execution, it would\r\nbe found to answer the wishes of those who framed it, and to foster\r\nthose friendships it was intended to preserve. The members would be\r\nbrought together at their annual assemblies, no longer to encounter a\r\ncommon enemy, but to encounter one another in debate and sentiment.\r\nFor something, I suppose, is to be done at these meetings, and,\r\nhowever unimportant, it will suffice to produce difference of opinion,\r\ncontradiction and irritation. The way to make friends quarrel is to put\r\nthem in disputation under the public eye. An experience of near twenty\r\nyears has taught me, that few friendships stand this test, and that\r\npublic assemblies, where every one is free to act and speak, are the\r\nmost powerful looseners of the bands of private friendship. I think,\r\ntherefore, that this institution would fail in its principal object,\r\nthe perpetuation of the personal friendships contracted through the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe objections of those who are opposed to the institution shall\r\nbe briefly sketched. You will readily fill them up. They urge that\r\nit is against the Confederation--against the letter of some of our\r\nconstitutions--against the spirit of all of them;--that the foundation\r\non which all these are built, is the natural equality of man, the\r\ndenial of every pre-eminence but that annexed to legal office, and,\r\nparticularly, the denial of a pre-eminence by birth; that, however,\r\nin their present dispositions, citizens might decline accepting\r\nhonorary instalments into the order, a time may come, when a change\r\nof dispositions would render these flattering, when a well-directed\r\ndistribution of them might draw into the order all the men of talents,\r\nof office and wealth, and in this case, would probably procure an\r\ningraftment into the government; that in this, they will be supported\r\nby their foreign members, and the wishes and influence of foreign\r\ncourts; that experience has shown that the hereditary branches of\r\nmodern governments are the patrons of privilege and prerogative,\r\nand not of the natural rights of the people, whose oppressors they\r\ngenerally are; that, besides these evils, which are remote, others may\r\ntake place more immediately; that a distinction is kept up between\r\nthe civil and military, which it is for the happiness of both to\r\nobliterate; that when the members assemble they will be proposing\r\nto do something, and what that something may be, will depend on\r\nactual circumstances; that being an organized body, under habits of\r\nsubordination, the first obstruction to enterprize will be already\r\nsurmounted; that the moderation and virtue of a single character\r\nhave probably prevented this Revolution from being closed, as most\r\nothers have been, by a subversion of that liberty it was intended to\r\nestablish; that he is not immortal, and his successor, or some of his\r\nsuccessors, may be led by false calculation into a less certain road to\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nWhat are the sentiments of Congress on this subject, and what line they\r\nwill pursue, can only be stated conjecturally. Congress, as a body, if\r\nleft to themselves, will, in my opinion, say nothing on the subject.\r\nThey may, however, be forced into a declaration by instructions from\r\nsome of the States, or by other incidents. Their sentiments, if forced\r\nfrom them, will be unfriendly to the institution. If permitted to\r\npursue their own path, they will check it by side-blows whenever it\r\ncomes in their way, and in competitions for office, on equal or nearly\r\nequal ground, will give silent preferences to those who are not of\r\nthe fraternity. My reasons for thinking this are, 1. The grounds on\r\nwhich they lately declined the foreign order proposed to be conferred\r\non some of our citizens. 2. The fourth of the fundamental articles\r\nof constitution for the new States. I enclose you the report; it has\r\nbeen considered by Congress, recommitted and reformed by a committee,\r\naccording to sentiments expressed on other parts of it, but the\r\nprinciple referred to, having not been controverted at all, stands in\r\nthis as in the original report; it is not yet confirmed by Congress.\r\n3. Private conversations on this subject with the members. Since the\r\nreceipt of your letter, I have taken occasion to extend these; not,\r\nindeed, to the military members, because, being of the order delicacy\r\nforbade it, but to the others pretty generally; and among these, I\r\nhave as yet found but one who is not opposed to the institution, and\r\nthat with an anguish of mind, though covered under a guarded silence,\r\nwhich I have not seen produced by any circumstance before. I arrived\r\nat Philadelphia before the separation of the last Congress, and saw\r\nthere and at Princeton some of its members, not now in delegation.\r\nBurke's piece happened to come out at that time, which occasioned\r\nthis institution to be the subject of conversation. I found the same\r\nimpressions made on them which their successors have received. I\r\nhear from other quarters that it is disagreeable, generally, to such\r\ncitizens as have attended to it, and, therefore, will probably be so to\r\nall, when any circumstance shall present it to the notice of all.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is as faithful an account of sentiments and facts as I am\r\nable to give you. You know the extent of the circle within which my\r\nobservations are at present circumscribed, and can estimate how far, as\r\nforming a part of the general opinion, it may merit notice, or ought to\r\ninfluence your particular conduct.\r\n\r\nIt remains now to pay obedience to that part of your letter, which\r\nrequests sentiments on the most eligible measures to be pursued by the\r\nsociety, at their next meeting. I must be far from pretending to be a\r\njudge of what would, in fact, be the most eligible measures for the\r\nsociety. I can only give you the opinions of those with whom I have\r\nconversed, and who, as I have before observed, are unfriendly to it.\r\nThey lead to these conclusions: 1. If the society proceed according to\r\nits institution, it will be better to make no applications to Congress\r\non that subject, or any other, in their associated character. 2. If\r\nthey should propose to modify it, so as to render it unobjectionable,\r\nI think this would not be effected without such a modification as\r\nwould amount almost to annihilation; for such would it be to part with\r\nits inheritability, its organization, and its assemblies. 3. If they\r\nshall be disposed to discontinue the whole, it would remain with them\r\nto determine whether they would choose it to be done by their own\r\nact only, or by a reference of the matter to Congress, which would\r\ninfallibly produce a recommendation of total discontinuance.\r\n\r\nYou will be sensible, Sir, that these communications are without\r\nreserve. I supposed such to be your wish, and mean them but as\r\nmaterials, with such others as you may collect, for your better\r\njudgment to work on. I consider the whole matter as between ourselves\r\nalone, having determined to take no active part in this or anything\r\nelse, which may lead to altercation, or disturb that quiet and\r\ntranquillity of mind, to which I consign the remaining portion of my\r\nlife. I have been thrown back by events, on a stage where I had never\r\nmore thought to appear.[110] It is but for a time, however, and as a\r\nday laborer, free to withdraw, or be withdrawn at will. While I remain,\r\nI shall pursue in silence the path of right, but in every situation,\r\npublic or private, I shall be gratified by all occasions of rendering\r\nyou service, and of convincing you there is no one to whom your\r\nreputation and happiness are dearer than to, Sir,\r\n\r\n              Your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [78] From this designation of the ancient metropolis, it\r\n     would seem even then to have been no favorite with him.\r\n\r\n     [79] The lady here alluded to is manifestly the Miss Rebecca\r\n     Burwell mentioned in his first letter; but what suggested the\r\n     quaint designations of her is not so obvious.

I do not doubt but before the receipt\r\n     of his, you will have heard of my late success against\r\n     Governor Hamilton, at post St. Vincennes. That gentleman,\r\n     with a body of men, possessed himself of that post on the\r\n     15th of December last, repaired the fortifications for a\r\n     repository, and in the spring, meant to attack this place,\r\n     which he made no doubt of carrying; where he was to be joined\r\n     by two hundred Indians from Michilimackinac, and five hundred\r\n     Cherokees, Chickasaws, and other nations. With this body, he\r\n     was to penetrate up the Ohio to Fort Pitt, sweeping Kentucky\r\n     on his way, having light brass cannon for the purpose, joined\r\n     on his march by all the Indians that could be got to him.\r\n     He made no doubt, that he could force all West Augusta. This\r\n     expedition was ordered by the commander-in-chief of Canada.\r\n     Destruction seemed to hover over us from every quarter;\r\n     detached parties of the enemy were in the neighborhood every\r\n     day, but afraid to attack. I ordered Major Bowman to evacuate\r\n     the fort at the Cohas, and join me immediately, which he\r\n     did. Having not received a scrape of a pen from you, for near\r\n     twelve months, I could see but little probability of keeping\r\n     possession of the country, as my number of men was too small\r\n     to stand a siege, and my situation too remote to call for\r\n     assistance. I made all the preparations I possibly could\r\n     for the attack, and was necessitated to set fire to some of\r\n     the houses in town, to clear them out of the way. But in the\r\n     height of the hurry, a Spanish merchant, who had been at St.\r\n     Vincennes, arrived, and gave the following intelligence: that\r\n     Mr. Hamilton had weakened himself, by sending his Indians\r\n     against the frontiers, and to block up the Ohio; that he had\r\n     not more than eighty men in garrison, three pieces of cannon,\r\n     and some swivels mounted; and that he intended to attack\r\n     this place, as soon as the winter opened, and made no doubt\r\n     of clearing the western waters by the fall. My situation\r\n     and circumstances induced me to fall on the resolution of\r\n     attacking him, before he could collect his Indians again. I\r\n     was sensible the resolution was as desperate as my situation,\r\n     but I saw no other probability of securing the country. I\r\n     immediately despatched a small galley, which I had fitted up,\r\n     mounting two four pounders and four swivels, with a company\r\n     of men and necessary stores on board, with orders to force\r\n     her way, if possible, and station herself a few miles below\r\n     the enemy, suffer nothing to pass her, and wait for further\r\n     orders. In the meantime, I marched across the country with\r\n     one hundred and thirty men, being all I could raise, after\r\n     leaving this place garrisoned by the militia. The inhabitants\r\n     of the country behaved exceedingly well, numbers of young men\r\n     turned out on the expedition, and every other one embodied\r\n     to guard the different towns. I marched the 7th of February.\r\n     Although so small a body, it took me sixteen days on the\r\n     route. The inclemency of the season, high waters, &c., seemed\r\n     to threaten the loss of the expedition. When within three\r\n     leagues of the enemy, in a direct line, it took us five days\r\n     to cross the drowned lands of the Wabash river, having to\r\n     wade often, upwards of two leagues, to our breast in water.\r\n     Had not the weather been warm, we must have perished. But\r\n     on the evening of the 23d, we got on dry land, in sight of\r\n     the enemy; and at seven o'clock, made the attack, before\r\n     they knew anything of us. The town immediately surrendered\r\n     with joy, and assisted in the siege. There was a continual\r\n     fire on both sides, for eighteen hours. I had no expectation\r\n     of gaining the fort until the arrival of my artillery. The\r\n     moon setting about one o'clock, I had an entrenchment thrown\r\n     up within rifle shot of their strongest battery, and poured\r\n     such showers of well-directed balls into their ports, that\r\n     we silenced two pieces of cannon in fifteen minutes, without\r\n     getting a man hurt.\r\n\r\n     Governor Hamilton and myself had, on the following day,\r\n     several conferences, but did not agree until the evening,\r\n     when he agreed to surrender the garrison (seventy-nine in\r\n     number) prisoners of war, with considerable stores. I got\r\n     only one man wounded; not being able to lose many, I made\r\n     them secure themselves well. Seven were badly wounded in the\r\n     fort, through the ports. In the height of this action, an\r\n     Indian party that had been to war, and taken two prisoners,\r\n     came in, not knowing of us. Hearing of them, I despatched a\r\n     party to give them battle in the commons, and got nine of\r\n     them, with the two prisoners, who proved to be Frenchmen.\r\n     Hearing of a convoy of goods from Detroit, I sent a party\r\n     of sixty men, in armed boats well mounted with swivels, to\r\n     meet them, before they could receive any intelligence. They\r\n     met the convoy forty leagues up the river, and made a prize\r\n     of the whole, taking forty prisoners and about ten thousand\r\n     pounds worth of goods and provisions; also, the mail from\r\n     Canada to Governor Hamilton, containing, however, no news\r\n     of importance. But what crowned the general joy, was the\r\n     arrival of William Morris, my express to you, with your\r\n     letters, which gave general satisfaction. The soldiery,\r\n     being made sensible of the gratitude of their country for\r\n     their services, were so much elated, that they would have\r\n     attempted the reduction of Detroit, had I ordered them.\r\n     Having more prisoners than I knew what to do with, I was\r\n     obliged to discharge a greater part of them, on parole. Mr.\r\n     Hamilton, his principal officers and a few soldiers, I have\r\n     sent to Kentucky, under a convoy of Captain Williams, in\r\n     order to be conducted to you. After despatching Morris with\r\n     letters to you, treating with the neighboring Indians, &c., I\r\n     returned to this place, leaving a sufficient garrison at St.\r\n     Vincennes.\r\n\r\n     During my absence, Captain Robert George, who now commands\r\n     the company formerly commanded by Captain Willing, had\r\n     returned from New Orleans, which greatly added to our\r\n     strength. It gave great satisfaction to the inhabitants,\r\n     when acquainted with the protection which was given them,\r\n     the alliance with France, &c. I am impatient for the arrival\r\n     of Colonel Montgomery, but have heard nothing of him lately.\r\n     By your instructions to me, I find you put no confidence in\r\n     General M'Intosh's taking Detroit, as you encourage me to\r\n     attempt it, if possible. It had been twice in my power. Had I\r\n     been able to raise only five hundred men when I first arrived\r\n     in the country, or when I was at St. Vincennes, could I have\r\n     secured my prisoners, and only have had three hundred good\r\n     men, I should have attempted it, and since learn there could\r\n     have been no doubt of success, as by some gentlemen lately\r\n     from that post, we are informed that the town and country\r\n     kept three days in feasting and diversions, on hearing of\r\n     my success against Mr. Hamilton, and were so certain of my\r\n     embracing the fair opportunity of possessing myself of that\r\n     post, that the merchants and others provided many necessaries\r\n     for us on our arrival; the garrison, consisting of only\r\n     eighty men, not daring to stop their diversions. They are now\r\n     completing a new fort, and I fear too strong for any force I\r\n     shall ever be able to raise in this country. We are proud to\r\n     hear Congress intends putting their forces on the frontiers,\r\n     under your direction. A small army from Pittsburg, conducted\r\n     with spirit, may easily take Detroit, and put an end to the\r\n     Indian war. Those Indians who are active against us, are\r\n     the six nations, part of the Shawnese, the Meamonies, and\r\n     about half the Chesaweys, Ottawas, Jowaas, and Pottawatimas\r\n     nations, bordering on the lakes. Those nations who have\r\n     treated with me, have behaved since very well; to wit, the\r\n     Peankishaws, Kiccapoos, Oreaottenans of the Wabash river,\r\n     the Kaskias, Perrians, Mechigamies, Foxes, Socks, Opays,\r\n     Illinois and Poues, nations of the Mississippi and Illinois\r\n     rivers. Part of the Chessaweys have also treated, and are\r\n     peaceable. I continually keep agents among them, to watch\r\n     their motions and keep them peaceably inclined. Many of the\r\n     Cherokees, Chickasaws, and their confederates, are, I fear,\r\n     ill disposed. It would be well if Colonel Montgomery should\r\n     give them a dressing, as he comes down the Tennessee. There\r\n     can be no peace expected from many nations, while the English\r\n     are at Detroit. I strongly suspect they will turn their arms\r\n     against the Illinois, as they will be encouraged. I shall\r\n     always be on my guard, watching every opportunity to take the\r\n     advantage of the enemy, and, if I am ever able to muster six\r\n     or seven hundred men, I shall give them a shorter distance to\r\n     come and fight me, than at this place.\r\n\r\n     There is one circumstance very distressing, that of our\r\n     moneys being discredited, to all intents and purposes, by\r\n     the great number of traders who come here in my absence, each\r\n     outbidding the other, giving prices unknown in this country\r\n     by five hundred per cent., by which the people conceived it\r\n     to be of no value, and both French and Spaniards refused to\r\n     take a farthing of it. Provision is three times the price it\r\n     was two months past, and to be got by no other means than\r\n     my own bonds, goods, or force. Several merchants are now\r\n     advancing considerable sums of their own property, rather\r\n     than the service should suffer, by which I am sensible they\r\n     must lose greatly, unless some method is taken to raise the\r\n     credit of our coin, or a fund be sent to Orleans, for the\r\n     payment of the expenses of this place, which would at once\r\n     reduce the price of every species of provision; money being\r\n     of little service to them, unless it would pass at the ports\r\n     they trade at. I mentioned to you, my drawing some bills\r\n     on Mr. Pollock in New Orleans, as I had no money with me.\r\n     He would accept the bills, but had not money to pay them\r\n     off, though the sums were trifling; so that we have little\r\n     credit to expect from that quarter. I shall take every\r\n     step I possibly can, for laying up a sufficient quantity of\r\n     provisions, and hope you will immediately send me an express\r\n     with your instructions. Public expenses in this country,\r\n     have hitherto been very low, and may still continue so,\r\n     if a correspondence is fixed at New Orleans for payment of\r\n     expenses in this country, or gold and silver sent. I am glad\r\n     to hear of Colonel Todd's appointment. I think government\r\n     has taken the only step they could have done, to make\r\n     this country flourish, and be of service to them. No other\r\n     regulation would have suited the people. The last account I\r\n     had of Colonel Rogers, was his being in New Orleans, with six\r\n     of his men. The rest he left at the Spanish Ozack, above the\r\n     Natches. I shall immediately send him some provisions, as I\r\n     learn he is in great want. I doubt, he will not be able to\r\n     get his goods up the river except in Spanish bottoms. One\r\n     regiment would be able to clear the Mississippi, and do great\r\n     damage to the British interests in Florida, and, by properly\r\n     conducting themselves, might perhaps gain the affection\r\n     of the people, so as to raise a sufficient force to give a\r\n     shock to Pensacola. Our alliance with France has entirely\r\n     devoted this people to our interest. I have sent several\r\n     copies of the articles to Detroit, and do not doubt but they\r\n     will produce the desired effect. Your instructions I shall\r\n     pay implicit regard to, and hope to conduct myself in such a\r\n     manner as to do honor to my country.\r\n\r\n         I am, with the greatest respect, your humble servant,\r\n\r\n                             G. R. CLARKE.\r\n\r\n     P. S. I understand there is a considerable quantity of cannon\r\n     ball at Pittsburg. We are much in want of four and six pound\r\n     ball. I hope you will immediately order some down.\r\n\r\n                                         IN COUNCIL, June 18, 1779.\r\n\r\n     The board proceeded to the consideration of the letters\r\n     of Colonel Clarke, and other papers relating to Henry\r\n     Hamilton, Esq., who has acted for some years past as\r\n     Lieutenant Governor of the settlement at and about Detroit,\r\n     and commandant of the British garrison there, under Sir\r\n     Guy Carleton, as Governor-in-chief; Philip Dejean justice\r\n     of the peace for Detroit, and William Lamothe, captain\r\n     of volunteers, prisoners of war, taken in the county of\r\n     Illinois.\r\n\r\n     They find, that Governor Hamilton has executed the task of\r\n     inciting the Indians to perpetrate their accustomed cruelties\r\n     on the citizens of the United States, without distinction of\r\n     age, sex, or condition, with an eagerness and avidity which\r\n     evince, that the general nature of his charge harmonized with\r\n     his particular disposition. They should have been satisfied,\r\n     from the other testimony adduced, that these enormities\r\n     were committed by savages acting under his commission; but\r\n     the number of proclamations which, at different times, were\r\n     left in houses, the inhabitants of which were killed or\r\n     carried away by the Indians, one of which proclamations is in\r\n     possession of the board, under the hand and seal of Governor\r\n     Hamilton, puts this fact beyond a doubt. At the time of his\r\n     captivity, it appears, he had sent considerable bodies of\r\n     Indians against the frontier settlements of these States, and\r\n     had actually appointed a great council of Indians, to meet\r\n     him at Tennessee, to concert the operations of this present\r\n     campaign. They find that his treatment of our citizens and\r\n     soldiers, taken and carried within the limits of his command,\r\n     has been cruel and inhuman; that in the case of John Dodge, a\r\n     citizen of these States, which has been particularly stated\r\n     to this board, he loaded him with irons, threw him into a\r\n     dungeon, without bedding, without straw, without fire, in\r\n     the dead of winter and severe climate of Detroit; that, in\r\n     that state, he wasted him with incessant expectations of\r\n     death: that when the rigors of his situation had brought him\r\n     so low, that death seemed likely to withdraw him from their\r\n     power, he was taken out and somewhat attended to, until a\r\n     little mended, and before he had recovered ability to walk,\r\n     was again returned to his dungeon, in which a hole was cut,\r\n     seven inches square only, for the admission of air, and\r\n     the same load of irons again put on him: that appearing, a\r\n     second time, in imminent danger of being lost to them, he\r\n     was again taken from his dungeon, in which he had lain from\r\n     January till June, with the intermission of a few weeks\r\n     only, before mentioned. That Governor Hamilton gave standing\r\n     rewards for scalps, but offered none for prisoners, which\r\n     induced the Indians, after making their captives carry their\r\n     baggage into the neighborhood of the fort, there to put them\r\n     to death, and carry in their scalps to the Governor, who\r\n     welcomed their return and success by a discharge of cannon.\r\n     That when a prisoner, brought alive, and destined to death\r\n     by the Indians, the fire already kindled, and himself bound\r\n     to the stake, was dexterously withdrawn, and secreted from\r\n     them by the humanity of a fellow prisoner, a large reward was\r\n     offered for the discovery of the victim, which having tempted\r\n     a servant to betray his concealment, the present prisoner\r\n     Dejean, being sent with a party of soldiers, surrounded the\r\n     house, took and threw into jail the unhappy victim and his\r\n     deliverer, where the former soon expired under the perpetual\r\n     assurances of Dejean, that he was to be again restored into\r\n     the hands of the savages; and the latter, when enlarged, was\r\n     bitterly reprimanded by Governor Hamilton.\r\n\r\n     It appears to them, that the prisoner Dejean was on all\r\n     occasions the willing and cordial instrument of Governor\r\n     Hamilton, acting both as judge and keeper of the jails, and\r\n     instigating and urging him, by malicious insinuations and\r\n     untruths, to increase, rather than relax his severities,\r\n     heightening the cruelty of his orders by his manner of\r\n     executing them; offering at one time a reward to one man to\r\n     be hangman for another, threatening his life on refusal,\r\n     and taking from his prisoners the little property their\r\n     opportunities enabled them to acquire.\r\n\r\n     It appears that the prisoner Lamothe was a captain of the\r\n     volunteer scalping parties of Indians and whites, who went,\r\n     from time to time, under general orders to spare neither\r\n     men, women, nor children. From this detail of circumstances,\r\n     which arose in a few cases only, coming accidentally to the\r\n     knowledge of the board, they think themselves authorized by\r\n     fair deduction, to presume what would be the horrid history\r\n     of the sufferings of the many who have expired under their\r\n     miseries, (which, therefore, will remain forever untold,)\r\n     or, who have escaped from them, and are yet too remote and\r\n     too much dispersed, to bring together their well-founded\r\n     accusations against the prisoners.\r\n\r\n     They have seen that the conduct of the British officers,\r\n     civil and military, has in the whole course of this war been\r\n     savage, and unprecedented among civilized nations; that our\r\n     officers taken by them, have been confined in crowded jails,\r\n     loathsome dungeons and prison ships, loaded with irons,\r\n     supplied often with no food, generally with too little for\r\n     the sustenance of nature, and that little sometimes unsound\r\n     and unwholesome, whereby such numbers have perished, that\r\n     captivity and death have with them been almost synonymous;\r\n     that they have been transported beyond seas, where their\r\n     fate is out of the reach of our inquiry, have been compelled\r\n     to take arms against their country, and by a refinement in\r\n     cruelty, to become murderers of their own brethren.\r\n\r\n     Their prisoners with us have, on the other hand, been treated\r\n     with humanity and moderation; they have been fed, on all\r\n     occasions, with wholesome and plentiful food, suffered to go\r\n     at large within extensive tracts of country, treated with\r\n     liberal hospitality, permitted to live in the families of\r\n     our citizens, to labor for themselves, to acquire and enjoy\r\n     profits, and finally to participate of the principal benefits\r\n     of society, privileged from all burdens.\r\n\r\n     Reviewing this contrast, which cannot be denied by our\r\n     enemies themselves, in a single point, and which has now been\r\n     kept up during four years of unremitting war, a term long\r\n     enough to produce well-founded despair that our moderation\r\n     may ever lead them to the practice of humanity; called on by\r\n     that justice we owe to those who are fighting the battles\r\n     of our country, to deal out, at length, miseries to their\r\n     enemies, measure for measure, and to distress the feelings\r\n     of mankind by exhibiting to them spectacles of severe\r\n     retaliation, where we had long and vainly endeavored to\r\n     introduce an emulation in kindness; happily possessed, by\r\n     the fortune of war, of some of those very individuals who,\r\n     having distinguished themselves personally in this line of\r\n     cruel conduct, are fit subjects to begin on, with the work of\r\n     retaliation; this board has resolved to advise the Governor,\r\n     that the said Henry Hamilton, Philip Dejean and William\r\n     Lamothe, prisoners of war, be put in irons, confined in the\r\n     dungeons of the public jail, debarred the use of pen, ink and\r\n     paper, and excluded all converse, except with their keeper.\r\n     And the Governor orders accordingly.\r\n\r\n                                                 ARCH: BLAIR, C.

On the arrival of this\r\n     information, Mr. Jefferson was released from his mission, and\r\n     returned to his home in Virginia on the 15th May, 1783.--ED.]\r\n\r\n     [107] [The death of Mrs. Jefferson.]\r\n\r\n     [108] BY THE UNITED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED:\r\n\r\n                                                 February 14, 1783.\r\n\r\n     The committee consisting of Mr. Jones, Mr. Rutledge, and\r\n     Mr. Wilson, to whom was referred a letter of the 7th from\r\n     the Honorable Thomas Jefferson, reported thereon, whereupon\r\n     on motion of Mr. Gorham, seconded by Mr. Wolcott, ordered:\r\n     That the Secretary for Foreign Affairs inform Mr. Jefferson,\r\n     that it is the pleasure of Congress, considering the advices\r\n     lately received in America and the probable situation of\r\n     affairs in Europe, that he do not proceed on his intended\r\n     voyage until he shall receive their further instructions.\r\n\r\n                                         CHARLES THOMPSON, (copied)\r\n\r\n                                                       _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n     [109] [The following resolution was passed by Congress\r\n     relative to Mr. Jefferson's mission to Europe.--ED.]\r\n\r\n     BY THE UNITED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED:\r\n\r\n                                                    April 1st, 1783.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Secretary for Foreign Affairs inform the Hon.\r\n     Thomas Jefferson, in answer to his letter of the 13th of March,\r\n     that Congress consider the object of his appointment so far\r\n     advanced as to render it unnecessary for him to pursue his voyage,\r\n     and that Congress are well satisfied with the readiness he has\r\n     shown in undertaking a service which from the present situation\r\n     of affairs they apprehend can be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n                                           Extracts from the minutes,\r\n\r\n                                           CHARLES THOMPSON, (copied)\r\n\r\n                                                        _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [110] [Mr. Jefferson being released from his mission to\r\n     Europe on account of the news of peace, and having returned\r\n     to Virginia, was again appointed by the Legislature a\r\n     delegate to Congress on the 6th of June, 1783.

We conferred together, and think it is\r\na case in which we could not interpose (were there as yet cause for\r\ninterposition), without express instructions from Congress. It is,\r\nhowever, our private opinion, which we give as individuals only, that\r\nMr. McLanahan, while in England, is subject to the laws of England;\r\nthat, therefore, he must employ counsel, and be guided in his defence\r\nby their advice. The law of nations, and the treaty of peace, as\r\nmaking a part of the law of the land, will undoubtedly be under the\r\nconsideration of the judges who pronounce on Mr. McLanahan's case;\r\nand we are willing to hope, that in their knowledge and integrity,\r\nhe will find certain resources against injustice, and a reparation of\r\nall injury to which he may have been groundlessly exposed. A final and\r\npalpable failure on their part, which we have no reason to apprehend,\r\nmight make the case proper for the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great respect and esteem,\r\nfor Mr. McLanahan, as well as yourself, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, May 11th, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I was honored, on the 2d instant, with the receipt of your\r\nfavor of March the 15th, enclosing the resolution of Congress of the\r\n10th of the same month, appointing me their Minister Plenipotentiary\r\nat this court, and also of your second letter of March 22d, covering\r\nthe commission and letter of credence for that appointment. I beg\r\npermission through you, Sir, to testify to Congress my gratitude for\r\nthis new mark of their favor, and my assurance of endeavoring to merit\r\nit by a faithful attention to the discharge of the duties annexed to\r\nit. Fervent zeal is all which I can be sure of carrying into their\r\nservice, and, where I fail through a want of those powers which\r\nnature and circumstances deny me, I shall rely on their indulgence,\r\nand much also on that candor with which your goodness will present my\r\nproceedings to their eye. The kind terms in which you are pleased to\r\nnotify this honor to me, require my sincere thanks. I beg you to accept\r\nthem, and to be assured of the perfect esteem, with which I have the\r\nhonor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL CHASTELLUX.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, June 7th, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have been honored with the receipt of your letter of the\r\n2d instant, and am to thank you, as I do sincerely, for the partiality\r\nwith which you receive the copy of the Notes on my country. As I can\r\nanswer for the facts, therein reported, on my own observation, and\r\nhave admitted none on the report of others, which were not supported\r\nby evidence sufficient to command my own assent, I am not afraid that\r\nyou should make any extracts you please for the Journal de Physique,\r\nwhich come within their plan of publication. The strictures on slavery\r\nand on the constitution of Virginia, are not of that kind, and they are\r\nthe parts which I do not wish to have made public, at least till I know\r\nwhether their publication would do most harm or good. It is possible,\r\nthat in my own country, these strictures might produce an irritation,\r\nwhich would indispose the people towards the two great objects I have\r\nin view; that is, the emancipation of their slaves, and the settlement\r\nof their constitution on a firmer and more permanent basis. If I learn\r\nfrom thence, that they will not produce that effect, I have printed and\r\nreserved just copies enough to be able to give one to every young man\r\nat the College. It is to them I look, to the rising generation, and not\r\nto the one now in power, for these great reformations. The other copy,\r\ndelivered at your hotel, was for Monsieur de Buffon. I meant to ask the\r\nfavor of you to have it sent to him, as I was ignorant how to do it. I\r\nhave one also for Monsieur Daubenton, but being utterly unknown to him,\r\nI cannot take the liberty of presenting it, till I can do it through\r\nsome common acquaintance.\r\n\r\nI will beg leave to say here a few words on the general question of\r\nthe degeneracy of animals in America. 1. As to the degeneracy of the\r\nman of Europe transplanted to America, it is no part of Monsieur de\r\nBuffon's system. He goes, indeed, within one step of it, but he stops\r\nthere. The Abbé Raynal alone has taken that step. Your knowledge of\r\nAmerica enables you to judge this question, to say, whether the lower\r\nclass of people in America are less informed and less susceptible\r\nof information, than the lower class in Europe; and whether those in\r\nAmerica, who have received such an education as that country can give,\r\nare less improved by it than Europeans of the same degree of education.\r\n2. As to the aboriginal man of America, I know of no respectable\r\nevidence on which the opinion of his inferiority of genius has been\r\nfounded, but that of Don Ulloa. As to Robertson, he never was in\r\nAmerica, he relates nothing on his own knowledge, he is a compiler only\r\nof the relations of others, and a mere translator of the opinions of\r\nMonsieur de Buffon. I should as soon, therefore, add the translators\r\nof Robertson to the witnesses of this fact, as himself. Paw, the\r\nbeginner of this charge, was a compiler from the works of others;\r\nand of the most unlucky description; for he seems to have read the\r\nwritings of travellers, only to collect and republish their lies. It is\r\nreally remarkable, that in three volumes 12mo, of small print, it is\r\nscarcely possible to find one truth, and yet, that the author should\r\nbe able to produce authority for every fact he states, as he says he\r\ncan. Don Ulloa's testimony is the most respectable. He wrote of what\r\nhe saw, but he saw the Indian of South America only, and that after\r\nhe had passed through ten generations of slavery. It is very unfair,\r\nfrom this sample, to judge of the natural genius of this race of men;\r\nand, after supposing that Don Ulloa had not sufficiently calculated\r\nthe allowance which should be made for this circumstance, we do him\r\nno injury in considering the picture he draws of the present Indians\r\nof South America, as no picture of what their ancestors were three\r\nhundred years ago. It is in North America we are to seek their original\r\ncharacter. And I am safe in affirming, that the proofs of genius given\r\nby the Indians of North America place them on a level with whites in\r\nthe same uncultivated state. The North of Europe furnishes subjects\r\nenough for comparison with them, and for a proof of their equality.\r\nI have seen some thousands myself, and conversed much with them, and\r\nhave found in them a masculine, sound understanding. I have had much\r\ninformation from men who had lived among them, and whose veracity\r\nand good sense were so far known to me, as to establish a reliance on\r\ntheir information. They have all agreed in bearing witness in favor of\r\nthe genius of this people. As to their bodily strength, their manners\r\nrendering it disgraceful to labor, those muscles employed in labor will\r\nbe weaker with them, than with the European laborer; but those which\r\nare exerted in the chase, and those faculties which are employed in the\r\ntracing an enemy or a wild beast, in contriving ambuscades for him, and\r\nin carrying them through their execution, are much stronger than with\r\nus, because they are more exercised. I believe the Indian, then, to\r\nbe, in body and mind, equal to the white man. I have supposed the black\r\nman, in his present state, might not be so; but it would be hazardous\r\nto affirm, that, equally cultivated for a few generations, he would not\r\nbecome so. 3. As to the inferiority of the other animals of America,\r\nwithout more facts, I can add nothing to what I have said in my Notes.\r\n\r\nAs to the theory of Monsieur de Buffon, that heat is friendly, and\r\nmoisture adverse to the production of large animals, I am lately\r\nfurnished with a fact by Dr. Franklin, which proves the air of London\r\nand of Paris to be more humid than that of Philadelphia, and so creates\r\na suspicion that the opinion of the superior humidity of America may,\r\nperhaps, have been too hastily adopted. And, supposing that fact\r\nadmitted, I think the physical reasonings urged to show, that in a\r\nmoist country animals must be small, and that in a hot one they must\r\nbe large, are not built on the basis of experiment. These questions,\r\nhowever, cannot be decided, ultimately, at this day. More facts must\r\nbe collected, and more time flow off, before the world will be ripe for\r\ndecision. In the meantime, doubt is wisdom.\r\n\r\nI have been fully sensible of the anxieties of your situation, and that\r\nyour attentions were wholly consecrated, where alone they were wholly\r\ndue, to the succor of friendship and worth. However much I prize your\r\nsociety, I wait with patience the moment when I can have it without\r\ntaking what is due to another. In the meantime, I am solaced with the\r\nhope of possessing your friendship, and that it is not ungrateful to\r\nyou to receive assurances of that with which I have the honor to be,\r\ndear Sir,\r\n\r\n              Your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 16, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency some\r\npropositions which have been made from London to the Farmers General,\r\nto furnish them with the tobaccos of Maryland and Virginia. For this\r\npaper, I am indebted to the zeal of the M. de La Fayette. I take\r\nthe liberty of troubling you with it on a supposition that it may\r\nbe possible to have this article furnished from those States to this\r\ncountry immediately without its passing through the entrepôt of London,\r\nand the returns for it being made, of course, in London merchandise.\r\nTwenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco a year delivered here in exchange\r\nfor the produce and manufacture of this country, many of which are as\r\ngood and cheaper than in England, would establish a rivalship for our\r\ncommerce which would have happy effects upon both countries. Whether\r\nthis end will be best effected by giving out these propositions to\r\nour merchants and exciting them to become candidates with the Farmers\r\nGeneral for this contract, or by any other means, your Excellency\r\ncan best judge. I shall mention this matter also to the Governor of\r\nVirginia. The other paper which accompanies the one before mentioned,\r\nis too miserable to need notice. I will take measures for apprising\r\nthem of its errors.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect and\r\nesteem, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 17, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of addressing you on the 11th of the last month\r\nby young Mr. Adams, who sailed in the packet of that month. That of the\r\npresent is likely to be retarded to the first of July, if not longer.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of May I communicated to the Count de Vergennes my\r\nappointment as minister plenipotentiary to this Court, and on the 17th\r\ndelivered my letter of credence to the King at a private audience, and\r\nwent through the other ceremonies usual on such occasion.\r\n\r\nWe have reason to expect that Europe will enjoy peace another year.\r\nThe negotiations between the Emperor and United Netherlands have been\r\nspun out to an unexpected length, but there seems little doubt but they\r\nwill end in peace. Whether the exchange projected between the Emperor\r\nand Elector of Bavaria, or the pretensions of the former in his line of\r\ndemarcation with the Ottoman Porte will produce war, is yet uncertain.\r\nIf either of them does, this country will probably take part in it to\r\nprevent a dangerous accession of power to the House of Austria. The\r\nzeal with which they have appeared to negotiate a peace between Holland\r\nand the Empire seems to prove that they do not apprehend being engaged\r\nin war against the Emperor for any other power; because, if they had\r\nsuch an apprehension, they would not wish to deprive themselves of\r\nthe assistance of the Dutch: and their opinion on this subject is\r\nbetter evidence than the details we get from the newspapers, and must\r\nweigh against the affected delays of the Porte, as to the line of\r\ndemarcation, the change in their ministry, their preparation for war,\r\nand other symptoms of like aspect. This question is not altogether\r\nuninteresting to us. Should this country be involved in a Continental\r\nwar, while differences are existing between us and Great Britain, the\r\nlatter might carry less moderation into the negotiations for settling\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI send you herewith the gazettes of Leyden and that of France for the\r\nlast two months, the latter because it is the best in this country, the\r\nformer as being the best in Europe. The Courier de l'Europe you will\r\nget genuine from London. As reprinted here it is of less worth. Should\r\nyour knowledge of the newspapers of this country lead you to wish\r\nfor any other, I shall take the greatest pleasure in adding it to the\r\nregular transmissions of two others which I shall make you in future.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest esteem and respect, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 17, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received three days ago your favor of April the 12th.\r\nYou therein speak of a former letter to me, but it has not come to\r\nhand, nor any other of later date than the 14th of December. My last\r\nto you was of the 11th of May by Mr. Adams, who went in the packet\r\nof that month. These conveyances are now becoming deranged. We have\r\nhad expectations of their coming to Havre, which would infinitely\r\nfacilitate the communication between Paris and Congress; but their\r\ndeliberations on the subject seem to be taking another turn. They\r\ncomplain of the expense, and that their commerce with us is too small\r\nto justify it. They therefore talk of sending a packet every six weeks\r\nonly. The present one, therefore, which should have sailed about this\r\ntime, will not sail till the 1st of July. However, the whole matter is\r\nas yet undecided. I have hopes that when Mr. St. John arrives from New\r\nYork, he will get them replaced on their monthly system. By-the-bye,\r\nwhat is the meaning of a very angry resolution of Congress on his\r\nsubject? I have it not by me, and therefore cannot cite it by date,\r\nbut you will remember it, and oblige me by explaining its foundation.\r\nThis will be handed you by Mr. Otto, who comes to America as Chargé\r\ndes Affaires, in the room of Mr. Marbois, promoted to the Intendancy\r\nof Hispaniola, which office is next to that of Governor. He becomes the\r\nhead of the civil, as the Governor is, of the military department.\r\n\r\nI am much pleased with Otto's appointment; he is good-humored,\r\naffectionate to America, will see things in a friendly light when\r\nthey admit of it, in a rational one always, and will not pique himself\r\non writing every trifling circumstance of irritation to his court. I\r\nwish you to be acquainted with him, as a friendly intercourse between\r\nindividuals who do business together produces a mutual spirit of\r\naccommodation useful to both parties. It is very much our interest to\r\nkeep up the affection of this country for us, which is considerable.\r\nA court has no affections; but those of the people whom they govern\r\ninfluence their decisions, even in the most arbitrary governments.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations between the Emperor and Dutch are spun out to an\r\namazing length. At present there is no apprehension, but that they\r\nwill terminate in peace. This court seems to press it with ardor, and\r\nthe Dutch are averse, considering the terms cruel and unjust, as they\r\nevidently are. The present delays, therefore, are imputed to their\r\ncoldness and to their forms. In the meantime, the Turk is delaying\r\nthe demarcation of limits between him and the Emperor, is making the\r\nmost vigorous preparations for war, and has composed his ministry of\r\nwarlike characters, deemed personally hostile to the Emperor. Thus\r\ntime seems to be spinning out, both by the Dutch and Turks, and time\r\nis wanting for France. Every year's delay is a great thing for her. It\r\nis not impossible, therefore, but that she may secretly encourage the\r\ndelays of the Dutch, and hasten the preparations of the Porte, while\r\nshe is recovering vigor herself, also, in order to be able to present\r\nsuch a combination to the Emperor as may dictate to him to be quiet.\r\nBut the designs of these courts are unsearchable. It is our interest to\r\npray that this country may have no continental war till our peace with\r\nEngland is perfectly settled. The merchants of this country continue\r\nas loud and furious as ever against the _Arret_ of August, 1784,\r\npermitting our commerce with their islands to a certain degree. Many\r\nof them have actually abandoned their trade. The ministry are disposed\r\nto be firm; but there is a point at which they will give way, that is,\r\nif the clamors should become such as to endanger their places. It is\r\nevident that nothing can be done by us at this time, if we may hope\r\nit hereafter. I like your removal to New York, and hope Congress will\r\ncontinue there, and never execute the idea of building their Federal\r\ntown. Before it could be finished, a change of members in Congress, or\r\nthe admission of new States, would remove them somewhere else. It is\r\nevident that when a sufficient number of the western States come in,\r\nthey will remove it to Georgetown. In the meantime, it is our interest\r\nthat it should remain where it is, and give no new pretensions to any\r\nother place. I am also much pleased with the proposition to the States\r\nto invest Congress with the regulation of their trade, reserving its\r\nrevenue to the States. I think it a happy idea, removing the only\r\nobjection which could have been justly made to the proposition. The\r\ntime, too, is the present, before the admission of the western States.\r\nI am very differently affected towards the new plan of opening our\r\nland office, by dividing the lands among the States, and selling\r\nthem at vendue. It separates still more the interests of the States,\r\nwhich ought to be made joint in every possible instance, in order\r\nto cultivate the idea of our being one nation, and to multiply the\r\ninstances in which the people shall look up to Congress as their head.\r\nAnd when the States get their portions, they will either fool them\r\naway, or make a job of it to serve individuals. Proofs of both these\r\npractices have been furnished, and by either of them that invaluable\r\nfund is lost, which ought to pay our public debt. To sell them at\r\nvendue, is to give them to the bidders of the day, be they many or few.\r\nIt is ripping up the hen which lays golden eggs. If sold in lots at a\r\nfixed price, as first proposed, the best lots will be sold first; as\r\nthese become occupied, it gives a value to the interjacent ones, and\r\nraises them, though of inferior quality, to the price of the first. I\r\nsend you by Mr. Otto a copy of my book. Be so good as to apologize to\r\nMr. Thompson for my not sending him one by this conveyance. I could\r\nnot burthen Mr. Otto with more on so long a road as that from here to\r\nL'Orient. I will send him one by a Mr. Williams, who will go ere long.\r\nI have taken measures to prevent its publication. My reason is, that\r\nI fear the terms in which I speak of slavery, and of our constitution,\r\nmay produce an irritation which will revolt the minds of our countrymen\r\nagainst reformation in these two articles, and thus do more harm than\r\ngood. I have asked of Mr. Madison to sound this matter as far as he\r\ncan, and, if he thinks it will not produce that effect, I have then\r\ncopies enough printed to give one to each of the young men at the\r\nCollege, and to my friends in the country.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to see a possibility of * * * being put into the Treasury.\r\nHe has no talents for the office, and what he has, will be employed\r\nin rummaging old accounts to involve you in eternal war with * * *\r\nand he will, in a short time, introduce such dissensions into the\r\ncommission, as to break it up. If he goes on the other appointment to\r\nKaskaskia, he will produce a revolt of that settlement from the United\r\nStates. I thank you for your attention to my outfit. For the articles\r\nof household furniture, clothes, and a carriage, I have already paid\r\ntwenty-eight thousand livres, and have still more to pay. For the\r\ngreatest part of this, I have been obliged to anticipate my salary,\r\nfrom which, however, I shall never be able to repay it. I find, that\r\nby a rigid economy, bordering however on meanness, I can save perhaps\r\nfive hundred livres a month, at least in the summer. The residue goes\r\nfor expenses so much of course and of necessity, that I cannot avoid\r\nthem without abandoning all respect to my public character. Yet I\r\nwill pray you to touch this string, which I know to be a tender one\r\nwith Congress, with the utmost delicacy. I had rather be ruined in my\r\nfortune than in their esteem. If they allow me half a year's salary\r\nas an outfit, I can get through my debts in time. If they raise the\r\nsalary to what it was, or even pay our house rent and taxes, I can\r\nlive with more decency. I trust that Mr. Adams's house at the Hague,\r\nand Dr. Franklin's at Passy, the rent of which has been always allowed\r\nhim, will give just expectations of the same allowance to me. Mr.\r\nJay, however, did not charge it, but he lived economically and laid up\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nI will take the liberty of hazarding to you some thoughts on the\r\npolicy of entering into treaties with the European nations, and the\r\nnature of them. I am not wedded to these ideas, and, therefore, shall\r\nrelinquish them cheerfully when Congress shall adopt others, and\r\nzealously endeavor to carry theirs into effect. First, as to the policy\r\nof making treaties. Congress, by the Confederation, have no original\r\nand inherent power over the commerce of the States. But, by the 9th\r\narticle, we are authorized to enter into treaties of commerce. The\r\nmoment these treaties are concluded, the jurisdiction of Congress over\r\nthe commerce of the States springs into existence, and that of the\r\nparticular States is superseded so far as the articles of the treaty\r\nmay have taken up the subject. There are two restrictions only, on\r\nthe exercise of the power of treaty by Congress. 1st. That they shall\r\nnot, by such treaty, restrain the legislatures of the States from\r\nimposing such duties on foreigners, as their own people are subject\r\nto; nor 2dly, from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any\r\nparticular species of goods. Leaving these two points free, Congress\r\nmay, by treaty, establish any system of commerce they please; but, as\r\nI before observed, it is by treaty alone they can do it. Though they\r\nmay exercise their other powers by resolution or ordinance, those over\r\ncommerce can only be exercised by forming a treaty, and this probably\r\nby an accidental wording of our Confederation. If, therefore, it is\r\nbetter for the States that Congress should regulate their commerce,\r\nit is proper that they should form treaties with all nations with\r\nwhom they may possibly trade. You see that my primary object in the\r\nformation of treaties is to take the commerce of the States out of\r\nthe hands of the States, and to place it under the superintendence\r\nof Congress, so far as the imperfect provisions of our constitutions\r\nwill admit, and until the States shall, by new compact, make them more\r\nperfect. I would say, then, to every nation on earth, _by treaty_,\r\nyour people shall trade freely with us, and ours with you, paying no\r\nmore than the most favored nation, in order to put an end to the right\r\nof individual States, acting by fits and starts, to interrupt our\r\ncommerce, or to embroil us with any nation. As to the terms of these\r\ntreaties, the question becomes more difficult. I will mention three\r\ndifferent plans. 1. That no duty shall be laid by either party on the\r\nproductions of the other. 2. That each may be permitted to equalize\r\ntheir duties to those laid by the other. 3. That each shall pay in the\r\nports of the other, such duties only as the most favored nations pay.\r\n\r\n1. Were the nations of Europe as free and unembarrassed of established\r\nsystems as we are, I do verily believe they would concur with us in\r\nthe first plan. But it is impossible. These establishments are fixed\r\nupon them; they are interwoven with the body of their laws and the\r\norganization of their government, and they make a great part of their\r\nrevenue; they cannot then, get rid of them.\r\n\r\n2. The plan of equal imposts presents difficulties insurmountable. For\r\nhow are the equal imposts to be effected? Is it by laying, in the ports\r\nof A, an equal per cent. on the goods of B, with that which B has laid\r\nin his ports on the goods of A? But how are we to find what is that\r\nper cent.? For this is not the usual form of imposts. They generally\r\npay by the ton, by the measure, by the weight, and not by the value.\r\nBesides, if A sends a million's worth of goods to B, and takes back\r\nbut the half of that, and each pays the same per cent., it is evident\r\nthat A pays the double of what he recovers in the same way from B: this\r\nwould be our case with Spain. Shall we endeavor to effect equality,\r\nthen, by saying A may levy so much on the sum of B's importations into\r\nhis ports, as B does on the sum of A's importations into the ports\r\nof B? But how find out that sum? Will either party lay open their\r\ncustom-house books candidly to evince this sum? Does either keep their\r\nbooks so exactly as to be able to do it? This proposition was started\r\nin Congress when our instructions were formed, as you may remember,\r\nand the impossibility of executing it occasioned it to be disapproved.\r\nBesides, who should have a right of deciding, when the imposts were\r\nequal? A would say to B, my imposts do not raise so much as yours: I\r\nraise them therefore. B would then say, you have made them greater than\r\nmine, I will raise mine; and thus a kind of auction would be carried\r\non between them, and a mutual irritation, which would end in anything,\r\nsooner than equality and right.\r\n\r\n3. I confess then to you, that I see no alternative left but that which\r\nCongress adopted, of each party placing the other on the footing of\r\nthe most favored nation. If the nations of Europe, from their actual\r\nestablishments, are not at liberty to say to America, that she shall\r\ntrade in their ports duty free, they may say she may trade there paying\r\nno higher duties than the most favored nation; and this is valuable\r\nin many of these countries, where a very great difference is made\r\nbetween different nations. There is no difficulty in the execution\r\nof this contract, because there is not a merchant who does not know,\r\nor may not know, the duty paid by every nation on every article.\r\nThis stipulation leaves each party at liberty to regulate their own\r\ncommerce by general rules, while it secures the other from partial and\r\noppressive discriminations. The difficulty which arises in our case is,\r\nwith the nations having American territory. Access to the West Indies\r\nis indispensably necessary to us. Yet how to gain it, when it is the\r\nestablished system of these nations to exclude all foreigners from\r\ntheir colonies. The only chance seems to be this: our commerce to the\r\nmother country is valuable to them. We must endeavor, then, to make\r\nthis the price of an admission into their West Indies, and to those who\r\nrefuse the admission, we must refuse our commerce, or load theirs by\r\nodious discriminations in our ports. We have this circumstance in our\r\nfavor too, that what one grants us in their islands, the others will\r\nnot find it worth their while to refuse. The misfortune is, that with\r\nthis country we gave this price for their aid in the war, and we have\r\nnow nothing more to offer. She, being withdrawn from the competition,\r\nleaves Great Britain much more at liberty to hold out against us. This\r\nis the difficult part of the business of treaty, and I own it does not\r\nhold out the most flattering prospects.\r\n\r\nI wish you would consider this subject, and write me your thoughts on\r\nit. Mr. Gerry wrote me on the same subject. Will you give me leave to\r\nimpose on you the trouble of communicating this to him? It is long, and\r\nwill save me much labor in copying. I hope he will be so indulgent as\r\nto consider it as an answer to that part of his letter, and will give\r\nme his further thoughts on it.\r\n\r\nShall I send you so much of the Encyclopedia as is already published,\r\nor reserve it here till you come? It is about forty volumes, which\r\nprobably is about half the work. Give yourself no uneasiness about\r\nthe money; perhaps I may find it convenient to ask you to pay trifles\r\noccasionally for me in America. I sincerely wish you may find it\r\nconvenient to come here; the pleasure of the trip will be less than\r\nyou expect, but the utility greater. It will make you adore your own\r\ncountry, its soil, its climate, its equality, liberty, laws, people,\r\nand manners. My God! how little do my countrymen know what precious\r\nblessings they are in possession of, and which no other people on\r\nearth enjoy. I confess I had no idea of it myself. While we shall see\r\nmultiplied instances of Europeans going to live in America, I will\r\nventure to say, no man now living will ever see an instance of an\r\nAmerican removing to settle in Europe, and continuing there. Come,\r\nthen, and see the proofs of this, and on your return add your testimony\r\nto that of every thinking American, in order to satisfy our countrymen\r\nhow much it is their interest to preserve, uninfected by contagion,\r\nthose peculiarities in their governments and manners, to which they\r\nare indebted for those blessings. Adieu, my dear friend; present\r\nme affectionately to your colleagues. If any of them think me worth\r\nwriting to, they may be assured that in the epistolary account I will\r\nkeep the debit side against them. Once more, adieu.\r\n\r\n                         Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. June 19. Since writing the above, we have received the following\r\naccount: Monsieur Pilatre de Roziere, who had been waiting for some\r\nmonths at Boulogne for a fair wind to cross the channel, at length took\r\nhis ascent with a companion. The wind changed after awhile, and brought\r\nhim back on the French coast. Being at a height of about six thousand\r\nfeet, some accident happened to his balloon of inflammable air; it\r\nburst, they fell from that height, and were crushed to atoms. There\r\nwas a Montgolfier combined with the balloon of inflammable air. It is\r\nsuspected the heat of the Montgolfier rarefied too much the inflammable\r\nair of the other, and occasioned it to burst. The Montgolfier came down\r\nin good order.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH JONES.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 19, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I take the liberty of enclosing to you a state of the case\r\nof one Polson, and begging your inquiries and information whether\r\nthe lands therein mentioned have been escheated and sold, and, if\r\nthey have, what would be the proper method of application to obtain a\r\ncompensation for them.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations between Holland and the Emperor are slow, but will\r\nprobably end in peace. It is believed the Emperor will not at present\r\npush the Bavarian exchange. The Porte delays the demarcation of limits\r\nwith him, and is making vigorous preparations for war. But neither\r\nwill this latter be permitted to produce a war, if France can prevent\r\nit, because, wherever the Emperor is seeking to enlarge his dominions,\r\nFrance will present to him the point of a bayonet. But she wishes\r\nextremely for repose, and has need of it. She is the wealthiest but\r\nworst governed country on earth; and her finances utterly unprepared\r\nfor war. We have need to pray for her repose, and that she may not be\r\nengaged in a continental war while our matters with Great Britain are\r\nso unsettled and so little like being settled.\r\n\r\nAn accident has happened here which will probably damp the ardor with\r\nwhich aërial navigation has been pursued. Monsieur Pilatre de Roziere\r\nhad been attending many months at Boulogne a fair wind to cross the\r\nchannel in a balloon which was compounded of one of inflammable air,\r\nand another called a Montgolfier with rarefied air only. He at length\r\nthought the wind fair and with a companion ascended. After proceeding\r\na proper direction about two leagues, the wind changed and brought\r\nthem again over the French coast. Being at the height of about six\r\nthousand feet, some accident, unknown, burst the balloon of inflammable\r\nair, and the Montgolfier being unequal alone to sustain their weight,\r\nthey precipitated from that height to the earth, and were crushed to\r\natoms. Though navigation by water is attended with frequent accidents,\r\nand in its infancy must have been attended with more, yet these are\r\nnow so familiar that we think little of them, while that which has\r\nsignalized the two first martyrs to the aëronautical art will probably\r\ndeter very many from the experiments they would have been disposed\r\nto make. Will you give me leave to hope the pleasure of hearing from\r\nyou sometimes. The details from my own country of the proceedings of\r\nthe legislative, executive and judiciary bodies, and even those which\r\nrespect individuals only, are the most pleasing treat we can receive\r\nat this distance, and the most useful also. I will promise in return\r\nwhatever may be interesting to you here.\r\n\r\n                  I am, with very perfect esteem, Sir,\r\n                        Your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 21, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of March the 6th, has come duly to hand. You\r\ntherein acknowledge the receipt of mine of November the 11th; at that\r\ntime you could not have received my last, of February the 8th. At\r\npresent there is so little new in politics, literature, or the arts,\r\nthat I write rather to prove to you my desire of nourishing your\r\ncorrespondence, than of being able to give you anything interesting\r\nat this time. The political world is almost lulled to sleep by the\r\nlethargic state of the Dutch negotiation, which will probably end in\r\npeace. Nor does this court profess to apprehend that the Emperor will\r\ninvolve this hemisphere in war by his schemes on Bavaria and Turkey.\r\nThe arts, instead of advancing, have lately received a check, which\r\nwill probably render stationary for awhile, that branch of them which\r\nhad promised to elevate us to the skies. Pilatre de Roziere, who had\r\nfirst ventured into that region, has fallen a sacrifice to it. In an\r\nattempt to pass from Boulogne over to England, a change in the wind\r\nhaving brought him back on the coast of France, some accident happened\r\nto his balloon of inflammable air, which occasioned it to burst, and\r\nthat of rarefied air combined with it being then unequal to the weight,\r\nthey fell to the earth from a height, which the first reports made six\r\nthousand feet, but later ones have reduced to sixteen hundred. Pilatre\r\nde Roziere was dead when a peasant, distant one hundred yards only,\r\nran to him; but Romain, his companion, lived about ten minutes, though\r\nspeechless, and without his senses. In literature there is nothing\r\nnew. For I do not consider as having added anything to that field my\r\nown Notes, of which I have had a few copies printed. I will send you\r\na copy by the first safe conveyance. Having troubled Mr. Otto with\r\none for Colonel Monroe, I could not charge him with one for you. Pray\r\nask the favor of Colonel Monroe, in page 5, line 17, to strike out\r\nthe words, \"above the mouth of the Appamattox,\" which makes nonsense\r\nof the passage; and I forgot to correct it before I had enclosed and\r\nsent off the copy to him. I am desirous of preventing the reprinting\r\nthis, should any book merchant think it worth it, till I hear from my\r\nfriends, whether the terms in which I have spoken of slavery and the\r\nconstitution of our State, will not, by producing an irritation, retard\r\nthat reformation which I wish, instead of promoting it. Dr. Franklin\r\nproposes to sail for America about the first or second week of July.\r\nHe does not yet know, however, by what conveyance he can go. Unable to\r\ntravel by land, he must descend the Seine in a boat to Havre. He has\r\nsent to England to get some vessel bound for Philadelphia, to touch at\r\nHavre for him. But he receives information that this cannot be done.\r\nHe has been on the look out ever since he received his permission\r\nto return; but, as yet, no possible means of getting a passage have\r\noffered, and I fear it is very uncertain when any will offer.\r\n\r\n                I am, with very great esteem, dear Sir,\r\n                        Your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 23, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of the 2d instant, since which I have\r\nreceived yours of the 3d and 7th. I informed you in mine of the\r\nsubstance of our letter to Baron Thulemeyer: last night came to hand\r\nhis acknowledgment of the receipt of it. He accedes to the method\r\nproposed for signing, and has forwarded our dispatch to the King. I\r\nenclose you a copy of our letter to Mr. Jay, to go by the packet of\r\nthis month. It contains a state of our proceedings since the preceding\r\nletter, which you had signed with us. This statement contains nothing\r\nbut what you had concurred with us in; and, as Dr. Franklin expects\r\nto go early in July to America, it is probable that the future letters\r\nmust be written by you and myself. I shall, therefore, take care that\r\nyou be furnished with copies of everything which comes to hand on the\r\njoint business.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of this Mr. Lambe? I am uneasy at the delay of\r\nthat business, since we know the ultimate decision of Congress. Dr.\r\nFranklin, having a copy of the Corps Diplomatique, has promised to\r\nprepare a draught of a treaty to be offered to the Barbary States: as\r\nsoon as he has done so, we will send it to you for your corrections.\r\nWe think it will be best to have it in readiness against the arrival\r\nof Mr. Lambe, on the supposition that he may be addressed to the joint\r\nministers for instructions.\r\n\r\nI asked the favor of you in my last, to choose two of the best London\r\npapers for me; one of each party. The Duke of Dorset has given me\r\nleave to have them put under his address, and sent to the office from\r\nwhich his despatches come. I think he called it Cleveland office, or\r\nCleveland lane, or by some such name; however, I suppose it can be\r\neasily known there. Will Mr. Stockdale undertake to have these papers\r\nsent regularly, or is this out of the line of his business? Pray order\r\nme, also, any really good pamphlets that come out from time to time,\r\nwhich he will charge to me.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DU PORTAIL.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 27, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of informing you some time ago that I had written\r\nto the Board of Treasury on the subject of the arrearages of interest\r\ndue to the foreign officers, and urging the necessity of paying them.\r\nI now enclose the extract of a letter which I have just received from\r\nthem, and by which you will perceive that their funds were not in a\r\ncondition for making that payment in the moment of receiving my letter,\r\nbut that they would be attentive to make it in the first moment it\r\nshould be in their power. There is still a second letter of mine on the\r\nway to them, on the same subject, which will again press for exertions\r\nin this business, which, however, I am satisfied they will not fail\r\nto do their utmost in. It will give me real pleasure to inform you\r\nof effectual provision for this purpose in the first moment possible,\r\nbeing with sentiments of esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, July 5, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you by Mr. Adams, May the 11th, and by Mr. Otto,\r\nJune the 17th. The latter acknowledged the receipt of yours of April\r\nthe 12th, which is the only one come to hand of later date than\r\nDecember the 14th. Little has occurred since my last. Peace seems to\r\nshow herself under a more decided form. The Emperor is now on a journey\r\nto Italy, and the two Dutch Plenipotentiaries have set out for Vienna;\r\nthere to make an apology for their State having dared to fire a gun\r\nin defence of her invaded rights: this is insisted on as a preliminary\r\ncondition. The Emperor seems to prefer the glory of terror to that of\r\njustice; and, to satisfy this tinsel passion, plants a dagger in the\r\nheart of every Dutchman which no time will extract. I enquired lately\r\nof a gentleman who lived long at Constantinople, in a public character,\r\nand enjoyed the confidence of that government, insomuch as to become\r\nwell acquainted with its spirit and its powers, what he thought might\r\nbe the issue of the present affair between the Emperor and the Porte.\r\nHe thinks the latter will not push matters to a war; and, if they do,\r\nthey must fail under it. They have lost their warlike spirit, and their\r\ntroops cannot be induced to adopt the European arms. We have no news\r\nyet of Mr. Lambe; of course, our Barbary proceedings are still at a\r\nstand.[111]\r\n\r\n                         Yours Affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, July 7, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--This will accompany a joint letter enclosing the draft of\r\na treaty, and my private letter of June 23d, which has waited so long\r\nfor a private conveyance. We daily expect from the Baron Thulemeyer\r\nthe French column for our treaty with his sovereign. In the meanwhile,\r\ntwo copies are preparing with the English column, which Dr. Franklin\r\nwishes to sign before his departure, which will be within four or\r\nfive days. The French, when received, will be inserted in the blank\r\ncolumns of each copy. As the measure of signing at several times and\r\nplaces is new, we think it necessary to omit no other circumstance\r\nof ceremony which can be observed. That of sending it by a person of\r\nconfidence, and invested with a character relative to the object,\r\nwho shall attest our signatures here, yours in London, and Baron\r\nThulemeyer's at the Hague, and who shall make the actual exchanges, we\r\nthink will contribute to supply the departure from the usual form, in\r\nother instances. For this reason, we have agreed to send Mr. Short on\r\nthis business, to make him a secretary _pro hac vice_, and to join Mr.\r\nDumas for the operations of exchange, &c. As Dr. Franklin will have\r\nleft us before Mr. Short's mission will commence, and I have never been\r\nconcerned in the ceremonials of a treaty, I will thank you for your\r\nimmediate information as to the papers he should be furnished with from\r\nhence. He will repair first to you in London, thence to the Hague, and\r\nthen return to Paris.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of Mr. Lambe? Supposing he was to call on the\r\ncommissioners for instructions, and thinking it best these should be in\r\nreadiness, Dr. Franklin undertook to consult well the Barbary treaties\r\nwith other nations, and to prepare a sketch which we should have sent\r\nfor your correction. He tells me he has consulted those treaties, and\r\nmade references to the articles proper for us, which, however, he will\r\nnot have time to put into form, but will leave them with me to reduce.\r\nAs soon as I see them, you shall hear from me. A late conversation with\r\nan English gentleman here makes me believe, what I did not believe\r\nbefore, that his nation thinks seriously that Congress have no power\r\nto form a treaty of commerce. As the explanations of this matter,\r\nwhich you and I may separately give, may be handed to their minister,\r\nit would be well that they should agree. For this reason, as well as\r\nfor the hope of your showing me wherein I am wrong, and confirming\r\nme where I am right, I will give you my creed on the subject. It is\r\ncontained in these four principles. By the Confederation, Congress\r\nhave no power given them, in the first instance, over the commerce\r\nof the States. But they have a power given them of entering into\r\ntreaties of commerce, and these treaties may cover the whole field of\r\ncommerce, with two restrictions only. 1. That the States may impose\r\nequal duties on foreigners as natives: and 2. That they may prohibit\r\nthe exportation or importation of any species of goods whatsoever. When\r\nthey shall have entered into such treaty, the superintendence of it\r\nresults to them; all the operations of commerce, which are protected by\r\nits stipulations, come under their jurisdiction, and the power of the\r\nStates to thwart them by their separate acts, ceases. If Great Britain\r\nasks, then, why she should enter into any treaty with us? why not carry\r\non her commerce without treaty? I answer; because, till a treaty is\r\nmade, no consul of hers can be received (his functions being called\r\ninto existence by a convention only, and the States having abandoned\r\nthe right of separate agreements and treaties); no protection to her\r\ncommerce can be given by Congress; no cover to it from those checks\r\nand discouragements with which the States will oppress it, acting\r\nseparately, and by fits and starts. That they will act so till a treaty\r\nis made Great Britain has had several proofs; and I am convinced those\r\nproofs will become general. It is, then, to put her commerce with us\r\non systematical ground, and under safe cover, that it behoves Great\r\nBritain to enter into treaty. As I own to you that my wish to enter\r\ninto treaties with the other powers of Europe arises more from a desire\r\nof bringing all our commerce under the jurisdiction of Congress, than\r\nfrom any other views. Because, according to my idea, the commerce\r\nof the United States with those countries, not under treaty with us,\r\nis under the jurisdiction of each State separately; but that of the\r\ncountries, which have treated with us, is under the jurisdiction of\r\nCongress, with the two fundamental restraints only, which I have before\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nI shall be happy to receive your corrections of these ideas, as I have\r\nfound, in the course of our joint services, that I think right when I\r\nthink with you.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere affection, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. Monsieur Houdon has agreed to go to America to take the figure\r\nof General Washington. In case of his death, between his departure from\r\nParis, and his return to it, we may lose twenty thousand livres. I ask\r\nthe favor of you to enquire what it will cost to ensure that sum, on\r\nhis life, in London, and to give me as early an answer as possible,\r\nthat I may order the insurance if I think the terms easy enough. He is,\r\nI believe, between thirty and thirty-five years of age, healthy enough,\r\nand will be absent about six months.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE CASTRIES.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, July 10th, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am honored with your Excellency's letter on the prize money\r\nfor which Mr. Jones applies. The papers intended to have been therein\r\nenclosed, not having been actually enclosed, I am unable to say\r\nanything on their subject. But I find that Congress, on the first day\r\nof November, 1783, recommended Captain Jones to their Minister here,\r\nas agent, to solicit, under his direction, payment to the officers and\r\ncrews for the prizes taken in Europe under his command; requiring him\r\npreviously to give to their superintendent of finance good security for\r\npaying to him whatever he should receive, to be by him distributed to\r\nthose entitled. In consequence of this, Captain Jones gave the security\r\nrequired, as is certified by the superintendent of finance on the 6th\r\nof November, 1783, and received from Doctor Franklin on the 17th of\r\nDecember, 1783, due authority, as agent, to solicit the said payments.\r\n\r\nFrom these documents, I consider Captain Jones as agent for the\r\ncitizens of the United States, interested in the prizes taken in Europe\r\nunder his command, and that he is properly authorized to receive the\r\nmoney due to them, having given good security to transmit it to the\r\ntreasury office of the United States, whence it will be distributed,\r\nunder the care of Congress, to the officers and crews originally\r\nentitled, or to their representatives.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. FRENCH AND NEPHEW.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, July 13th, 1785.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I had the honor of receiving your letter of June the\r\n21st, enclosing one from Mr. Alexander of June the 17th, and a copy\r\nof his application to Monsieur de Calonnes. I am very sensible that\r\nno trade can be on a more desperate footing than that of tobacco, in\r\nthis country; and that our merchants must abandon the French markets,\r\nif they are not permitted to sell the productions they bring, on\r\nsuch terms as will enable them to purchase reasonable returns in the\r\nmanufactures of France. I know but one remedy to the evil; that of\r\nallowing a free vent; and I should be very happy in being instrumental\r\nto the obtaining this. But, while the purchase of tobacco is\r\nmonopolized by a company, and they pay for that monopoly a heavy price\r\nto the government, they doubtless are at liberty to fix such places and\r\nterms of purchase, as may enable them to make good their engagements\r\nwith government. I see no more reason for obliging them to give a\r\ngreater price for tobacco than they think they can afford, than to\r\ndo the same between two individuals treating for a horse, a house, or\r\nanything else. Could this be effected by applications to the minister,\r\nit would only be a palliative which would retard the ultimate cure, so\r\nmuch to be wished for and aimed at by every friend to this country, as\r\nwell as to America.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Gentlemen, your most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. STYLES.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, July 17, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have long deferred doing myself the honor of writing to\r\nyou, wishing for an opportunity to accompany my letter with a copy\r\nof the Bibliothéque Physico-œconomique; a book published here\r\nlately in four small volumes, and which gives an account of all the\r\nimprovements in the arts which have been made for some years past. I\r\nflatter myself you will find in it many things agreeable and useful.\r\nI accompany it with the volumes of the \"Connoisance des Tems\" for\r\nthe years 1781, 1784, 1785, 1786, 1787. But why, you will ask, do I\r\nsend you old almanacs, which are proverbially useless? Because, in\r\nthese publications have appeared, from time to time, some of the most\r\nprecious things in astronomy. I have searched out those particular\r\nvolumes which might be valuable to you on this account. That of\r\n1781, contains de la Caille's catalogue of fixed stars reduced to\r\nthe commencement of that year, and a table of the aberrations and\r\nnutations of the principal stars. 1784 contains the same catalogue\r\nwith the nebuleuses of Messier. 1785 contains the famous catalogue\r\nof Hamsteed, with the positions of the stars reduced to the beginning\r\nof the year 1784, and which supersedes the use of that immense book.\r\n1786 gives you Euler's lunar tables corrected; and 1787, the tables\r\nfor the planet Herschel. The two last needed not an apology, as not\r\nbeing within the description of old almanacs. It is fixed on grounds\r\nwhich scarcely admit a doubt that the planet Herschel was seen by Mayer\r\nin the year 1756, and was considered by him as one of the zodiacal\r\nstars, and, as such, arranged in his catalogue, being the 964th which\r\nhe describes. This 964th of Mayer has been since missing, and the\r\ncalculations for the planet Herschel show that it should have been,\r\nat the time of Mayer's observation, where he places his 964th star.\r\nThe volume of 1787 gives you Mayer's catalogue of the zodiacal stars.\r\nThe researches of the natural philosophers of Europe seem mostly in\r\nthe field of chemistry, and here, principally, on the subjects of air\r\nand fire. The analysis of these two subjects, presents to us very new\r\nideas. When speaking of the \"Bibliothéque Physico-œconomique,\" I\r\nshould have observed, that since its publication, a man in this city\r\nhas invented a method of moving a vessel on the water, by a machine\r\nworked within the vessel. I went to see it. He did not know himself\r\nthe principle of his own invention. It is a screw with a very broad\r\nthin worm, or rather it is a thin plate with its edge applied spirally\r\nround an axis. This being turned, operates on the air, as a screw does,\r\nand may be literally said to screw the vessel along; the thinness of\r\nthe medium, and its want of resistance, occasion a loss of much of the\r\nforce. The screw, I think, would be more effectual if placed below\r\nthe surface of the water. I very much suspect that a countryman of\r\nours, Mr. Bushnel of Connecticut, is entitled to the merit of a prior\r\ndiscovery of this use of the screw. I remember to have heard of his\r\nsubmarine navigation during the war, and, from what Colonel Humphreys\r\nnow tells me, I conjecture that the screw was the power he used. He\r\njoined to this a machine for exploding under water at a given moment.\r\nIf it were not too great a liberty for a stranger to take, I would\r\nask from him a narration of his actual experiments, with or without\r\na communication of his principle, as he should choose. If he thought\r\nproper to communicate it, I would engage never to disclose it, unless\r\nI could find an opportunity of doing it for his benefit. I thank you\r\nfor your information as to the great bones found on the Hudson river.\r\nI suspect that they must have been of the same animal with those found\r\non the Ohio; and, if so, they could not have belonged to any human\r\nfigure, because they are accompanied with tusks of the size, form and\r\nsubstance, of those of the elephant. I have seen a part of the ivory,\r\nwhich was very good. The animal itself must have been much larger\r\nthan an elephant. Mrs. Adams gives me an account of a flower found in\r\nConnecticut, which vegetates when suspended in the air. She brought one\r\nto Europe. What can be this flower? It would be a curious present to\r\nthis continent.\r\n\r\nThe accommodation likely to take place between the Dutch and the\r\nEmperor, leaves us without that unfortunate resource for news, which\r\nwars give us. The Emperor has certainly had in view the Bavarian\r\nexchange of which you have heard; but so formidable an opposition\r\npresented itself, that he has thought proper to disavow it. The Turks\r\nshow a disposition to go to war with him, but, if this country can\r\nprevail on them to remain in peace, they will do so. It has been\r\nthought that the two Imperial courts have a plan of expelling the Turks\r\nfrom Europe. It is really a pity so charming a country should remain in\r\nthe hands of a people, whose religion forbids the admission of science\r\nand the arts among them. We should wish success to the object of the\r\ntwo empires, if they meant to leave the country in possession of the\r\nGreek inhabitants. We might then expect, once more, to see the language\r\nof Homer and Demosthenes a living language. For I am persuaded the\r\nmodern Greek would easily get back to its classical models. But this is\r\nnot intended. They only propose to put the Greeks under other masters:\r\nto substitute one set of barbarians for another.\r\n\r\nColonel Humphreys, having satisfied you that all attempts would be\r\nfruitless here to obtain money or other advantages for your college,\r\nI need add nothing on that head. It is a method of supporting colleges\r\nof which they have no idea, though they practice it for the support of\r\ntheir lazy monkish institutions.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, July 28, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favors of July the 16th and 18th, came to hand the same\r\nday on which I had received Baron Thulemeyer's enclosing the ultimate\r\ndraught for the treaty. As this draught, which was in French, was to\r\nbe copied into the two instruments which Dr. Franklin had signed, it\r\nis finished this day only. Mr. Short sets out immediately. I have put\r\ninto his hands a letter of instructions how to conduct himself, which I\r\nhave signed, leaving a space above for your signature. The two treaties\r\nI have signed at the left hand, Dr. Franklin having informed me that\r\nthe signatures are read backwards. Besides the instructions to Mr.\r\nShort, I signed also a letter to Mr. Dumas, associating him with Mr.\r\nShort. These two letters I made out as nearly conformably as I could\r\nto your ideas expressed in your letter of the 18th. If anything more\r\nbe necessary, be so good as to make a separate instruction for them\r\nsigned by yourself, to which I will accede. I have not directed Mr.\r\nDumas's letter. I have heretofore directed to him as \"Agent for the\r\nUnited States at the Hague,\" that being the description under which\r\nthe journals of Congress speak of him. In his last letter to me, is\r\na paragraph from which I conclude that the address I have used is not\r\nagreeable, and perhaps may be wrong. Will you be so good as to address\r\nthe letter to him, and to inform me how to address him hereafter?\r\nMr. Short carries also the other papers necessary. His equipment for\r\nhis journey requiring expenses which cannot come into the account of\r\nordinary expenses, such as clothes, &c., what allowance should be made\r\nhim? I have supposed somewhere between a guinea a day, and one thousand\r\ndollars a year, which I believe is the salary of a private secretary.\r\nThis I mean as over and above his travelling expenses. Be so good as to\r\nsay, and I will give him an order on his return. The danger of robbery,\r\nhas induced me to furnish him with only money enough to carry him to\r\nLondon. You will be so good as to procure him enough to carry him to\r\nthe Hague, and back to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe confederation of the King of Prussia with some members of the\r\nGermanic body, for the preservation of their constitution, is, I\r\nthink, beyond a doubt. The Emperor has certainly complained of it in\r\nformal communications at several courts. By what can be collected\r\nfrom diplomatic conversation here, I also conclude it tolerably\r\ncertain, that the Elector of Hanover has been invited to accede to\r\nthe confederation, and has done, or is doing so. You will have better\r\ncircumstances, however, on the spot, to form a just judgment. Our\r\nmatters with the first of these powers being now in conclusion, I wish\r\nit was so with the Elector of Hanover. I conclude, from the general\r\nexpressions in your letter, that little may be expected. Mr. Short\r\nfurnishing so safe a conveyance that the trouble of the cypher may be\r\ndispensed with, I will thank you for such details of what has passed,\r\nas may not be too troublesome to you.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of getting books into Paris delayed for some time my\r\nreceipt of the Corps Diplomatique left by Dr. Franklin. Since that,\r\nwe have been engaged with expediting Mr. Short. A huge packet also,\r\nbrought by Mr. Mazzei, has added to the causes which have as yet\r\nprevented me from examining Dr. Franklin's notes on the Barbary treaty.\r\nIt shall be one of my first occupations. Still the possibility is too\r\nobvious that we may run counter to the instructions of Congress, of\r\nwhich Mr. Lambe is said to be the bearer. There is a great impatience\r\nin America for these treaties. I am much distressed between this\r\nimpatience and the known will of Congress, on the one hand, and the\r\nuncertainty of the details committed to this tardy servant.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Dorset sets out for London to-morrow. He says he shall\r\nbe absent two months. There is some whisper that he will not return,\r\nand that Lord Carmarthen wishes to come here. I am sorry to lose so\r\nhonest a man as the Duke. I take the liberty to ask an answer about the\r\ninsurance of Houdon's life.\r\n\r\nCongress is not likely to adjourn this summer. They have passed an\r\nordinance for selling their lands. I have not received it.\r\n\r\nWhat would you think of the enclosed draught to be proposed to the\r\ncourts of London and Versailles? I would add Madrid and Lisbon, but\r\nthat they are still more desperate than the others. I know it goes\r\nbeyond our powers, and beyond the powers of Congress too; but it is so\r\nevidently for the good of all the States, that I should not be afraid\r\nto risk myself on it, if you are of the same opinion. Consider it, if\r\nyou please, and give me your thoughts on it by Mr. Short; but I do not\r\ncommunicate it to him, nor any other mortal living but yourself.\r\n\r\nBe pleased to present me in the most friendly terms to the ladies, and\r\nbelieve me to be, with great esteem,\r\n\r\n                   Dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE BARON DE THULEMEYER.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, July 28, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I was honored with the receipt of your letter on the 24th\r\ninstant, together with the French draught of the treaty proposed.\r\nAs it ultimately meets his Majesty's approbation, Dr. Franklin, our\r\ncolleague, having assisted us through the progress of this business,\r\nwe were desirous he also should join in the execution. Duplicate\r\ninstruments were therefore prepared, each divided into two columns, in\r\none of which we entered the English form as it has been settled between\r\nus, leaving the other blank to receive the French, which we expected\r\nfrom you. In this state the Doctor, before his departure, put his\r\nsignature and seal to the two instruments. We have since put into the\r\nblank column the French form received from you verbatim. As we thought\r\nthat such instruments should not be trusted out of confidential hands,\r\nand the bearer thereof, William Short, Esq., heretofore a member of the\r\nCouncil of State in Virginia, happened to be in Paris, and willing to\r\ngive us his assistance herein, they are delivered into his hands with\r\nother necessary papers, according to an arrangement previously made\r\nbetween Mr. Adams, Dr. Franklin and myself. He will proceed to London\r\nto obtain Mr. Adams's signature, and thence to the Hague, where we\r\nhave, according to your desire, associated Mr. Dumas with him to concur\r\nwith you in the final execution. It is with singular pleasure I see\r\nthis connection formed by my country with a sovereign whose character\r\ngives a lustre to all the transactions of which he makes part. Give me\r\nleave to recommend Mr. Short to your notice. His talents and merits are\r\nsuch as to have placed him, young as he is, in the Supreme Executive\r\nCouncil of Virginia, an office which he relinquished to visit Europe.\r\nThe letter to Baron Steuben shall be taken care of.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. N. AND J. VAN STAPHORST _Amsterdam_.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, July 30, 1785.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I received yesterday your favor of the 25th. Supposing\r\nthat the funds which are the object of your enquiry, are those which\r\nconstitute what we call our domestic debt, it is my opinion that they\r\nare absolutely secure: I have no doubt at all but that they will be\r\npaid, with their interest at six per cent. But I cannot say that they\r\nare as secure and solid as the funds which constitute our _foreign_\r\ndebt; because no man in America ever entertained a doubt that our\r\nforeign debts is to be paid fully; but some people in America have\r\nseriously contended, that the certificates, and other evidences of\r\nour domestic debt, ought to be redeemed only at what they have cost\r\nthe holder; for I must observe to you, that these certificates of\r\ndomestic debt, having as yet no provision for the payment of principal\r\nor interest, and the original holders being mostly needy, have been\r\nsold at a very great discount. When I left America (July, 1784,) they\r\nsold, in different States, at from 15s. to 2s. 6d. in the pound; and\r\nany amount of them might then have been purchased. Hence some thought\r\nthat full justice would be done, if the public paid the purchasers of\r\nthem what they actually paid for them, and interest on that. But this\r\nis very far from being a general opinion; a very great majority being\r\nfirmly decided that they shall be paid fully. Were I the holder of any\r\nof them, I should not have the least fear of their full payment. There\r\nis also a difference between different species of certificates; some of\r\nthem being receivable in taxes, others having the benefit of particular\r\nassurances, &c. Again, some of these certificates are for paper money\r\ndebts. A deception here must be guarded against. Congress ordered all\r\nsuch to be re-settled by the depreciation tables, and a new certificate\r\nto be given in exchange for them, expressing their value in real money.\r\nBut all have not yet been re-settled. In short, this is a science in\r\nwhich few in America are expert, and no person in a foreign country can\r\nbe so. Foreigners should therefore be sure that they are well advised,\r\nbefore they meddle with them, or they may suffer. If you will reflect\r\nwith what degree of success persons actually in America could speculate\r\nin the European funds, which rise and fall daily, you may judge how\r\nfar those in Europe may do it in the American funds, which are more\r\nvariable from a variety of causes.\r\n\r\nI am not at all acquainted with Mr. Daniel Parker, further than having\r\nonce seen him in Philadelphia. He is of Massachusetts, I believe, and\r\nI am of Virginia. His circumstances are utterly unknown to me. I think\r\nthere are few men in America, if there is a single one, who could\r\ncommand a hundred thousand pounds' sterling worth of these notes, at\r\ntheir real value. At their nominal amount, this might be done perhaps\r\nwith twenty-five thousand pounds sterling, if the market price of them\r\nbe as low as when I left America.\r\n\r\nI am, with very great respect, Gentlemen, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, July 31, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I was honored yesterday with yours of the 24th instant.\r\nWhen the first article of our instructions of May 7th, 1784, was under\r\ndebate in Congress, it was proposed that neither party should make\r\nthe other pay, in their ports, greater duties, than they paid in the\r\nports of the other. One objection to this was, its impracticability;\r\nanother, that it would put it out of our power to lay such duties\r\non alien importation as might encourage importation by natives. Some\r\nmembers, much attached to English policy, thought such a distinction\r\nshould actually be established. Some thought the power to do it should\r\nbe reserved, in case any peculiar circumstances should call for it,\r\nthough under the present, or, perhaps, any probable circumstances,\r\nthey did not think it would be good policy ever to exercise it. The\r\nfooting _gentis amicissimæ_ was therefore adopted, as you see in the\r\ninstruction. As far as my enquiries enable me to judge, France and\r\nHolland make no distinction of duties between aliens and natives. I\r\nalso rather believe that the other States of Europe make none, England\r\nexcepted, to whom this policy, as that of her navigation act, seems\r\npeculiar. The question then is, should we disarm ourselves of the power\r\nto make this distinction against all nations, in order to purchase\r\nan exception from the alien duties in England only; for if we put her\r\nimportations on the footing of native, all other nations with whom we\r\ntreat will have a right to claim the same. I think we should, because\r\nagainst other nations, who make no distinction in their ports between\r\nus and their own subjects, we ought not to make a distinction in\r\nours. And if the English will agree, in like manner, to make none, we\r\nshould, with equal reason, abandon the right as against them. I think\r\nall the world would gain, by setting commerce at perfect liberty. I\r\nremember that when we were digesting the general form of our treaty,\r\nthis proposition to put foreigners and natives on the same footing\r\nwas considered; and we were all three, Dr. Franklin as well as you\r\nand myself, in favor of it. We finally, however, did not admit it,\r\npartly from the objection you mention, but more still on account of\r\nour instructions. But though the English proclamation had appeared in\r\nAmerica at the time of framing these instructions, I think its effect,\r\nas to alien duties, had not yet been experienced, and therefore was\r\nnot attended to. If it had been noted in the debate, I am sure that\r\nthe annihilation of our whole trade would have been thought too great a\r\nprice to pay for the reservation of a barren power, which a majority of\r\nthe members did not propose ever to exercise, though they were willing\r\nto retain it. Stipulating for equal rights to foreigners and natives,\r\nwe obtain more in foreign ports than our instructions required, and we\r\nonly part with, in our own ports, a power of which sound policy would\r\nprobably forever forbid the exercise. Add to this, that our treaty will\r\nbe for a very short term, and if any evil be experienced under it, a\r\nreformation will soon be in our power. I am, therefore, for putting\r\nthis among our original propositions to the court of London.\r\n\r\nIf it should prove an insuperable obstacle with them, or if it should\r\nstand in the way of a greater advantage, we can but abandon it in the\r\ncourse of the negotiation.\r\n\r\nIn my copy of the cypher, on the alphabetical side, numbers are wanting\r\nfrom \"Denmark\" to \"disc\" inclusive, and from \"gone\" to \"governor\"\r\ninclusive. I suppose them to have been omitted in copying; will you be\r\nso good as to send them to me from yours, by the first safe conveyance?\r\n\r\nWith compliments to the ladies, and to Colonel Smith,\r\n\r\n             I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.[112]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WM. SHORT.[113]\r\n\r\n                                                             July, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--A treaty of amity and commerce between the United States of\r\nAmerica and his majesty the King of Prussia having been arranged with\r\nthe Baron de Thulemeyer, his majesty's envoy extraordinary at the\r\nHague, specially empowered for this purpose, and it being inconsistent\r\nwith our other duties to repair to that place ourselves for the purpose\r\nof executing and exchanging the instruments of treaty, we hereby\r\nappoint you special secretary for that purpose.\r\n\r\nYou receive from Colonel Humphries, secretary of our legation, the\r\noriginal of our full powers, and a copy of the same attested by him,\r\nheretofore communicated to us by the Baron de Thulemeyer, and the two\r\ninstruments of treaty awarded between us, each in two columns, the\r\none in English and the other in French, equally originals. From us you\r\nreceive a letter to Charles Dumas, Esq., for the United States at the\r\nHague, associating him with you in the object of your mission.\r\n\r\nYou will proceed immediately to the Hague, and being arrived there,\r\nwill deliver the letter to Mr. Dumas, and proceed conjunctly with him\r\nin the residue of your business, which is to be executed there.\r\n\r\nThe original of our full powers is to be exhibited to the\r\nplenipotentiary of his majesty the King of Prussia, and the attested\r\ncopy is to be left with him, you taking back the original. You will in\r\nlike manner ask an exhibition of the original of his full powers, and\r\nalso a copy duly attested: you will compare the copy with the original,\r\nand, being satisfied of its exactness, you will return the original\r\nand keep the copy. That you may be under no doubt whether the full\r\npowers exhibited to you be sufficient or not, you receive from Colonel\r\nHumphries those which the Baron de Thulemeyer heretofore sent to us; if\r\nthose which shall be exhibited agree with these in form or substance,\r\nthey will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe full powers being approved on each side and exchanged, you will\r\nobtain the signature and seal of the Prussian plenipotentiary to the\r\ntwo instruments of treaty with which you are charged, and yourself and\r\nMr. Dumas will attest the same. One of these original instruments will\r\nremain in the hands of the Prussian plenipotentiary, the other you will\r\nretain.\r\n\r\nYou will ask that the ratification of his majesty the King of Prussia\r\nbe made known to us as soon as it shall have taken place, giving an\r\nassurance on our part that that of Congress shall also be communicated\r\nas soon as it shall have taken place; when both ratifications shall be\r\nknown, measures may be concerted for exchanging them. You will confer\r\nwith the said plenipotentiary on the expediency of keeping this treaty\r\nuncommunicated to the public until the exchange of ratifications agree\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nYou will then return to Paris, and redeliver to the secretary of our\r\nlegation, our original full powers, the copies of those of Prussia\r\nbefore-mentioned, and the original instrument of the treaty which you\r\nshall have retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE CASTRIES.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, August 3, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The enclosed copy of a letter from Captain John Paul Jones, on\r\nthe subject on which your Excellency did me the honor to write me, on\r\nthe ---- day of July, will inform you that there is still occasion\r\nto be troublesome to you. A Mr. Puchilberg, a merchant of L'Orient,\r\nwho seems to have kept himself unknown till money was to be received,\r\nnow presents powers to receive it, signed by the American officers\r\nand crews; and this produces a hesitation in the person to whom your\r\norder was directed. Congress, however, having substituted Captain\r\nJones, as agent, to solicit and receive this money, he having given\r\nthem security to forward it, when received, to their treasury, to\r\nbe thence distributed to the claimants, and having at a considerable\r\nexpense of time, trouble, and money, attended it to a conclusion, are\r\ncircumstances of weight, against which Mr. Puchilberg seems to have\r\nnothing to oppose, but a nomination by individuals of the crew, under\r\nwhich he has declined to act, and permitted the business to be done\r\nby another without contradiction from him. Against him, too, it is\r\nurged that he fomented the sedition which took place among them; that\r\nhe obtained this nomination from them while their minds were under\r\nferment; and that he has given no security for the faithful payment of\r\nthe money to those entitled to it.\r\n\r\nI will add to these, one more circumstance which appears to render it\r\nimpossible that he should execute this trust. It is now several years\r\nsince the right to this money arose. The persons in whom it originally\r\nvested were probably from different States in America. Many of them\r\nmust be now dead; and their rights passed on to their representatives.\r\nBut who are their representatives? The laws of some States prefer one\r\ndegree of relations, those of others prefer another, there being no\r\nuniformity among the States on this point. Mr. Puchilberg, therefore,\r\nshould know which of the parties are dead; in what order the laws of\r\ntheir respective States call their relations to the succession; and,\r\nin every case, which of those orders are actually in existence, and\r\nentitled to the share of the deceased. With the Atlantic Ocean between\r\nthe principals and their substitute, your Excellency will perceive\r\nwhat an inexhaustible source of difficulties, of chicanery, and delay,\r\nthis might furnish to a person who should find an interest in keeping\r\nthis money, as long as possible, in his own hands. Whereas, if it\r\nbe lodged in the treasury of Congress, they, by an easy reference to\r\nthe tribunals of the different States, can have every one's portion\r\nimmediately rendered to himself, if living; and if dead, to such of his\r\nrelations as the laws of his particular State prefer, and as shall be\r\nfound actually living. I the rather urge this course, as I foresee that\r\nit will relieve your Excellency from numberless appeals, which these\r\npeople will continually be making from the decisions of Mr. Puchilberg;\r\nappeals likely to perpetuate that trouble of which you have already\r\nhad too much, and to which I am sorry to be obliged to add, by asking\r\na peremptory order for the execution of what you were before pleased to\r\ndecide on this subject.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect,\r\nyour Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, August 6, 1785\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I now enclose you a draught of a treaty for the Barbary\r\nStates, together with the notes Dr. Franklin left me. I have retained\r\na press copy of this draught, so that by referring to any article, line\r\nand word, in it, you can propose amendments, and send them by the post,\r\nwithout anybody's being able to make much of the main subject. I shall\r\nbe glad to receive any alterations you may think necessary, as soon\r\nas convenient, that this matter may be in readiness. I enclose also a\r\nletter containing intelligence from Algiers. I know not how far it is\r\nto be relied on. My anxiety is extreme indeed, as to these treaties.\r\nWe know that Congress have decided ultimately to treat. We know how far\r\nthey will go. But unfortunately we know also, that a particular person\r\nhas been charged with instructions for us, these five months, who\r\nneither comes nor writes to us. What are we to do? It is my opinion,\r\nthat if Mr. Lambe does not come in either of the packets (English or\r\nFrench) now expected, we ought to proceed. I therefore propose to you\r\nthis term, as the end of our expectations of him, and that if he does\r\nnot come, we send some other person. Dr. Bancroft or Captain Jones\r\noccurs to me as the fittest. If we consider the present object only,\r\nI think the former would be the most proper; but if we look forward to\r\nthe very probable event of war with those pirates, an important object\r\nwould be obtained by Captain Jones' becoming acquainted with their\r\nports, force, tactics, &c. Let me know your opinion on this. I have\r\nnever mentioned it to either, but I suppose either might be induced\r\nto go. Present me affectionately to the ladies and Colonel Smith, and\r\nbe assured of the sincerity with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. PRICE.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, August 7, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of July the 2d came duly to hand. The concern you\r\ntherein express as to the effect of your pamphlet in America, induces\r\nme to trouble you with some observations on that subject.\r\n\r\nFrom my acquaintance with that country, I think I am able to judge,\r\nwith some degree of certainty, of the manner in which it will have been\r\nreceived. Southward of the Chesapeake, it will find but few readers\r\nconcurring with it in sentiment, on the subject of slavery. From\r\nthe mouth to the head of the Chesapeake, the bulk of the people will\r\napprove it in theory, and it will find a respectable minority ready\r\nto adopt it in practice; a minority, which for weight and worth of\r\ncharacter, preponderates against the greater number, who have not the\r\ncourage to divest their families of a property, which, however, keeps\r\ntheir conscience unquiet. Northward of the Chesapeake, you may find,\r\nhere and there, an opponent to your doctrine, as you may find, here and\r\nthere, a robber and murderer; but in no greater number. In that part\r\nof America, there being but few slaves, they can easily disencumber\r\nthemselves of them; and emancipation is put into such a train, that in\r\na few years there will be no slaves northward of Maryland. In Maryland,\r\nI do not find such a disposition to begin the redress of this enormity,\r\nas in Virginia. This is the next State to which we may turn our eyes\r\nfor the interesting spectacle of justice, in conflict with avarice\r\nand oppression; a conflict wherein the sacred side is gaining daily\r\nrecruits, from the influx into office of young men grown, and growing\r\nup. These have sucked in the principles of liberty, as it were, with\r\ntheir mother's milk; and it is to them I look with anxiety to turn the\r\nfate of this question. Be not therefore discouraged. What you have\r\nwritten will do a great deal of good; and could you still trouble\r\nyourself with our welfare, no man is more able to give aid to the\r\nlaboring side. The College of William and Mary, in Williamsburg, since\r\nthe re-modelling of its plan, is the place where are collected together\r\nall the young men of Virginia, under preparation for public life. They\r\nare there under the direction (most of them) of a Mr. Wythe, one of\r\nthe most virtuous of characters, and whose sentiments on the subject\r\nof slavery are unequivocal. I am satisfied, if you could resolve to\r\naddress an exhortation to those young men, with all that eloquence\r\nof which you are master, that its influence on the future decision\r\nof this important question would be great, perhaps decisive. Thus you\r\nsee, that, so far from thinking you have cause to repent of what you\r\nhave done, I wish you to do more, and wish it, on an assurance of its\r\neffect. The information I have received from America, of the reception\r\nof your pamphlet in the different States, agrees with the expectations\r\nI had formed.\r\n\r\nOur country is getting into a ferment against yours, or rather has\r\ncaught it from yours. God knows how this will end; but assuredly in\r\none extreme or the other. There can be no medium between those who have\r\nloved so much. I think the decision is in your power as yet, but will\r\nnot be so long.\r\n\r\nI pray you to be assured of the sincerity of the esteem and respect\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 10, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 4th instant came to hand yesterday. I\r\nnow enclose you the two _Arrets_ against the importation of foreign\r\nmanufactures into this kingdom. The cause of the balance against this\r\ncountry, in favor of England, as well as its amount, is not agreed on.\r\nNo doubt the rage for English manufactures must be a principal cause.\r\nThe speculators in exchange say also that those of the circumjacent\r\ncountries who have a balance in their favor against France, remit that\r\nbalance to England from France. If so, it is possible that the English\r\nmay count this balance twice; that is, in summing their exports to one\r\nof these States, and their imports from it, they count the difference\r\nonce in their favor, then a second time when they sum the remittances\r\nof cash they receive from France. There has been no _Arret_ relative to\r\nour commerce since that of August, 1784. And all the late advices from\r\nthe French West Indies are, that they have now in their ports always\r\nthree times as many vessels as there ever were before, and that the\r\nincrease is principally from our States. I have now no further fears\r\nof that _Arret's_ standing its ground. When it shall become firm, I\r\ndo not think its extension desperate. But whether the placing it on\r\nthe firm basis of treaty be practicable, is a very different question.\r\nAs far as it is possible to judge from appearances, I conjecture\r\nthat Crawford will do nothing. I infer this from some things in his\r\nconversation, and from an expression of the Count de Vergennes in a\r\nconversation with me yesterday. I pressed upon him the importance of\r\nopening their ports freely to us in the moment of the oppressions of\r\nthe English regulations against us, and perhaps of the suspension of\r\ntheir commerce. He admitted it, but said we had free ingress with our\r\nproductions. I enumerated them to him, and showed him on what footing\r\nthey were, and how they might be improved. We are to have further\r\nconversations on the subject. I am afraid the voyage to Fontainebleau\r\nwill interrupt them. From the inquiries I have made, I find I cannot\r\nget a very small and indifferent house there for the season, (that\r\nis, for a month,) for less than one hundred or one hundred and fifty\r\nguineas. This is nearly the whole salary for the time, and would leave\r\nnothing to eat. I therefore cannot accompany the court thither, but\r\nI will endeavor to go there occasionally from Paris. They tell me it\r\nis the most favorable scene for business with the Count de Vergennes,\r\nbecause he is then more abstracted from the domestic applications.\r\nCount d'Aranda is not yet returned from the waters of Vichy. As soon\r\nas he returns, I will apply to him in the case of Mr. Watson. I will\r\npray you to insure Houdon's life from the 27th of last month till his\r\nreturn to Paris. As he was to stay in America a month or two, he will\r\nprobably be about six months absent; but the three per cent. for the\r\nvoyage being once paid, I suppose they will insure his life by the\r\nmonth, whether his absence be longer or shorter. The sum to be insured\r\nis fifteen thousand livres tournois. If it be not necessary to pay\r\nthe money immediately, there is a prospect of exchange becoming more\r\nfavorable. But whenever it is necessary, be so good as to procure it by\r\nselling a draft on Mr. Grand, which I will take care shall be honored.\r\nWith compliments to the ladies,\r\n\r\n                I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 14, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I was honored, on the 22d ultimo, with the receipt of your letter\r\nof June the 15th; and delivered the letter therein enclosed, from the\r\nPresident of Congress to the King. I took an opportunity of asking the\r\nCount de Vergennes, whether the Chevalier Luzerne proposed to return\r\nto America? He answered me that he did; and that he was here, for a\r\ntime only, to arrange his private affairs. Of course, this stopped my\r\nproceeding further, in compliance with the hint in your letter. I knew\r\nthat the Chevalier Luzerne still retained the character of minister\r\nto Congress, which occasioned my premising the question I did. But,\r\nnotwithstanding the answer, which indeed was the only one the Count\r\nde Vergennes could give me, I believe it is not expected that the\r\nChevalier will return to America: that he is waiting an appointment\r\nhere, to some of their embassies, or some other promotion, and in the\r\nmeantime, as a favor, is permitted to retain his former character.\r\nKnowing the esteem borne him in America, I did not suppose it would\r\nbe wished that I should add anything which might occasion an injury\r\nto him; and the rather, as I presumed that at this time, there did not\r\nexist the same reason for wishing the arrival of a minister in America,\r\nwhich, perhaps, existed there at the date of your letter. Count Adhemar\r\nis just arrived from London, on account of a paralytic disease with\r\nwhich he has been struck. It does not seem improbable that his place\r\nwill be supplied, and perhaps by the Chevalier de la Luzerne.\r\n\r\nA French vessel has lately refused the salute to a British armed\r\nvessel in the channel. The chargé des affaires of Great Britain, at\r\nthis court, (their ambassador having gone to London a few days ago,)\r\nmade this the subject of a conference with the Count de Vergennes, on\r\nTuesday last. He told me that the Count explained the transaction as\r\nthe act of the individual master of the French vessel, not founded in\r\nany public orders. His earnestness, and his endeavors to find terms\r\nsufficiently soft to express the Count's explanation, had no tendency\r\nto lessen any doubts I might have entertained on this subject. I think\r\nit possible the refusal may have been by order: nor can I believe that\r\nGreat Britain is in a condition to resent it, if it was so. In this\r\ncase, we shall see it repeated by France; and her example will then\r\nbe soon followed by other nations. The news-writers bring together\r\nthis circumstance, with the departure of the French ambassador from\r\nLondon, and the English ambassador from Paris, the manœuvring of a\r\nFrench fleet just off the channel, the collecting some English vessels\r\nof war in the channel, the failure of a commercial treaty between the\r\ntwo countries, and a severe _Arret_ here against English manufactures,\r\nas foreboding war. It is possible that the fleet of manœuvre, the\r\nrefusal of the salute, and the English fleet of observation, may have\r\na connection with one another. But I am persuaded the other facts are\r\ntotally independent of these, and of one another, and are accidentally\r\nbrought together in point of time. Neither nation is in a condition\r\nto go to war: Great Britain, indeed, the least so of the two. The\r\nlatter power, or rather, its monarch, as Elector of Hanover, has lately\r\nconfederated with the King of Prussia and others of the Germanic\r\nbody, evidently in opposition to the Emperor's designs on Bavaria.\r\nAn alliance, too, between the Empress of Russia and the republic\r\nof Venice, seems to have had him in view, as he had meditated some\r\nexchange of territory with that republic. This desertion of the powers\r\nheretofore thought friendly to him, seems to leave no issue for his\r\nambition, but on the side of Turkey. His demarkation with that country\r\nis still unsettled. His difference with the Dutch is certainly agreed.\r\nThe articles are not yet made public; perhaps not quite adjusted. Upon\r\nthe whole, we may count on another year's peace in Europe, and that our\r\nfriends will not, within that time, be brought into any embarrassments,\r\nwhich might encourage Great Britain to be difficult in settling the\r\npoints still unsettled between us.\r\n\r\nYou have, doubtless, seen in the papers, that this court was sending\r\ntwo vessels into the south sea, under the conduct of a Captain\r\nPeyrouse. They give out, that the object is merely for the improvement\r\nof our knowledge of the geography of that part of the globe. And\r\ncertain it is, that they carry men of eminence in different branches\r\nof science. Their loading, however, as detailed in conversations, and\r\nsome other circumstances, appeared to me to indicate some other design:\r\nperhaps that of colonizing on the western coast of America; or, it may\r\nbe, only to establish one or more factories there, for the fur trade.\r\nPerhaps we may be little interested in either of these objects. But we\r\nare interested in another, that is, to know whether they are perfectly\r\nweaned from the desire of possessing continental colonies in America.\r\nEvents might arise, which would render it very desirable for Congress\r\nto be satisfied they have no such wish. If they would desire a colony\r\non the western side of America, I should not be quite satisfied that\r\nthey would refuse one which should offer itself on the eastern side.\r\nCaptain Paul Jones being at L'Orient, within a day's journey of Brest,\r\nwhere Captain Peyrouse's vessels lay, I desired him, if he could\r\nnot satisfy himself at L'Orient of the nature of this equipment, to\r\ngo to Brest for that purpose: conducting himself so as to excite no\r\nsuspicion that we attended at all to this expedition. His discretion\r\ncan be relied on, and his expenses for so short a journey, will be a\r\ntrifling price for satisfaction on this point. I hope, therefore, that\r\nmy undertaking that the expenses of his journey shall be reimbursed him\r\nwill not be disapproved.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, lately arrived from New York, tells me he thinks it will\r\nbe satisfactory to Congress to be informed of the effect produced\r\nhere by the insult of Longchamps on Monsieur de Marbois. Soon after\r\nmy arrival in France last summer, it was the matter of a conversation\r\nbetween the Count de Vergennes and myself. I explained to him the\r\neffect of the judgment against Longchamps. He did not say that it\r\nwas satisfactory, but neither did he say a word from which I could\r\ncollect that it was not so. The conversation was not official, because\r\nforeign to the character in which I then was. He has never mentioned\r\na word on the subject to me since, and it was not for me to introduce\r\nit at any time. I have never once heard it mentioned in conversation,\r\nby any person of this country, and have no reason to suppose that\r\nthere remains any uneasiness on the subject. I have indeed been told,\r\nthat they had sent orders to make a formal demand of Longchamps from\r\nCongress, and had immediately countermanded these orders. You know\r\nwhether this be true. If it be, I should suspect the first orders to\r\nhave been surprised from them by some exaggeration, and that the latter\r\nwas a correction of their error, in the moment of further reflection.\r\nUpon the whole, there certainly appears to me no reason to urge the\r\nState, in which the fact happened, to any violation of their laws,\r\nnor to set a precedent which might hereafter be used in cases more\r\ninteresting to us than the late one.\r\n\r\nIn a late conversation with the Count de Vergennes, he asked me if the\r\ncondition of our finances was improving. He did not make an application\r\nof the question to the arrearages of their interest, though perhaps\r\nhe meant that I should apply it. I told him the impost still found\r\nobstacles, and explained to him the effects which I hoped from our land\r\noffice. Your letter of the 15th of April, did not come to hand till\r\nthe 27th ultimo. I enclose a letter from Mr. Dumas to the President of\r\nCongress, and accompany the present with the Leyden Gazette and Gazette\r\nof France, from the date last sent you to the present time.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 14, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The letter of June 18th, signed by Dr. Franklin and myself, is\r\nthe last addressed to you from hence on the objects of the general\r\ncommission. As circumstances rendered it necessary that the signature\r\nof the Prussian treaty, whenever it should be in readiness, should be\r\nmade separately, the intervention of a person of confidence between\r\nthe Prussian Plenipotentiary and us became also requisite. His office\r\nwould be to receive the duplicates of the treaty here, signed by Dr.\r\nFranklin and myself, to carry them to London to Mr. Adams, and to the\r\nHague to Baron Thulemeyer for their signatures. Moreover, to take hence\r\nthe original of our full powers to show to Baron Thulemeyer, and the\r\ncopy of his which he has before communicated to us, to ask from him\r\na sight of the original, to compare the copy with it, and certify the\r\nlatter to be true. Mr. Adams, Dr. Franklin, and myself, therefore, had\r\nconcluded to engage Mr. Short (a gentleman of Virginia who lives with\r\nme at present) to transact this business, and to invest him with the\r\ncharacter of Secretary _pro hac vice_, in order that his signature\r\nof the truth of the copy of Baron Thulemeyer's full powers might\r\nauthenticate that copy. On the receipt of the letter No. 1, therefore,\r\nfrom that minister, Mr. Short set out hence with the necessary papers.\r\nBy a letter lately received from him, I expect he left London for\r\nthe Hague about the 10th instant, and that the treaty is ultimately\r\nexecuted by this time. In respect to the desire expressed by Baron\r\nThulemeyer in his letter, we associated Mr. Dumas with Mr. Short to\r\nassist in the exchange of signatures and other ceremonies of execution.\r\nWe agreed to bear Mr. Short's expenses, and have thought that a guinea\r\na day (Sundays excluded) would be a proper compensation for his trouble\r\nand the necessary equipments for his journey, which could not enter\r\ninto the account of travelling expenses. I hope by the first safe\r\nconveyance to be able to forward to you the original of the treaty. No\r\n2 is my answer to Baron Thulemeyer's letter, No. 3 our instructions to\r\nMr. Short, and No. 4 letter to Mr. Dumas.\r\n\r\nMr. Lambe's delay gives me infinite uneasiness. You will see by the\r\ninclosed papers, Nos. 5, 6, and 7, sent me by Mr. Carmichael, that\r\nthe Emperor of Morocco, at the instance of the Spanish Court, has\r\ndelivered up the crew of the Betsey. No. 8, also received from Mr.\r\nCarmichael, is a list of the articles given the Emperor of Morocco\r\nthe last year by the States General. It is believed that the Spanish\r\nnegociator at Algiers has concluded a peace with that State, and has\r\nagreed to give them a million of dollars, besides a very considerable\r\nquantity of things in kind. The treaty meets with difficulties in the\r\nratification,--perhaps the exorbitance of the price may occasion them.\r\nRumors are spread abroad that they are pointing their preparations at\r\nus. The enclosed paper, No. 9, is the only colorable evidence of this\r\nwhich has come to my knowledge. I have proposed to Mr. Adams that if\r\nMr. Lambe does not come either in the French or English packet, then\r\n(August 6) next expected, to send some person immediately to negotiate\r\nthese treaties, on the presumption that Mr. Lambe's purpose has been\r\nchanged. We shall still be at a loss for the instructions of which he\r\nis said to have been the bearer. I expect Mr. Adams's answer on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect and\r\nesteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 15, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the conversation which I had the honor of having with your\r\nExcellency, a few days ago, on the importance of placing, _at this\r\ntime_, the commerce between France and America on the best footing\r\npossible, among other objects of this commerce, that of tobacco was\r\nmentioned, as susceptible of greater encouragement and advantage to\r\nthe two nations. Always distrusting what I say in a language I speak\r\nso imperfectly, I will beg your permission to state, in English, the\r\nsubstance of what I had then the honor to observe, adding some more\r\nparticular details for your consideration.\r\n\r\nI find the consumption of tobacco in France estimated at from fifteen\r\nto thirty millions of pounds. The most probable estimate, however,\r\nplaces it at twenty-four millions.\r\n\r\n   This costing eight sous the pound, delivered in a\r\n     port of France, amounts to                         9,600,000 livres.\r\n   Allow six sous a pound, as the average cost of the\r\n     different manufactures                             7,200,000\r\n   The revenue which the King derives from this, is\r\n     something less than                               30,000,000\r\n                                                       ----------\r\n   Which would make the cost of the whole              46,800,000\r\n   But it is sold to the consumers at an average of\r\n     three livres the pound                            72,000,000\r\n                                                       ----------\r\n   There remain, then, for the expenses of collection  25,200,000 livres.\r\n\r\nThis is within a sixth as much as the King receives, and so gives\r\nnearly one half for collecting the other. It would be presumption\r\nin me, a stranger, to suppose my numbers perfectly accurate. I have\r\ntaken them from the best and most disinterested authorities I could\r\nfind. Your Excellency will know how far they are wrong; and should you\r\nfind them considerably wrong, yet I am persuaded you will find, after\r\nstrictly correcting them, that the collection of this branch of the\r\nrevenue still absorbs too much.\r\n\r\nMy apology for making these remarks will, I hope, be found in my wishes\r\nto improve the commerce between the two nations, and the interest\r\nwhich my own country will derive from this improvement. The monopoly\r\nof the purchase of tobacco in France discourages both the French and\r\nAmerican merchant from bringing it here, and from taking in exchange\r\nthe manufactures and productions of France. It is contrary to the\r\nspirit of trade, and to the dispositions of merchants, to carry a\r\ncommodity to any market where but one person is allowed to buy it, and\r\nwhere, of course, that person fixes its price, which the seller must\r\nreceive, or re-export his commodity, at the loss of his voyage thither.\r\nExperience accordingly shows, that they carry it to other markets,\r\nand that they take in exchange the merchandise of the place where they\r\ndeliver it. I am misinformed, if France has not been furnished from a\r\nneighboring nation with considerable quantities of tobacco since the\r\npeace, and been obliged to pay there in coin, what might have been paid\r\nhere in manufactures, had the French and American merchants brought\r\nthe tobacco originally here. I suppose, too, that the purchases made\r\nby the Farmers General, in America, are paid for chiefly in coin,\r\nwhich coin is also remitted directly hence to England, and makes an\r\nimportant part of the balance supposed to be in favor of that nation\r\nagainst this. Should the Farmers General, by themselves, or by the\r\ncompany to whom they may commit the procuring these tobaccos from\r\nAmerica, require, for the satisfaction of government on this head, the\r\nexportation of a proportion of merchandise in exchange for them, it\r\nwould be an unpromising expedient. It would only commit the exports,\r\nas well as imports, between France and America, to a monopoly, which,\r\nbeing secure against rivals in the sale of the merchandise of France,\r\nwould not be likely to sell at such moderate prices as might encourage\r\nits consumption there, and enable it to bear a competition with similar\r\narticles from other countries. I am persuaded this exportation of\r\ncoin may be prevented, and that of commodities effected, by leaving\r\nboth operations to the French and American merchants, instead of the\r\nFarmers General. They will import a sufficient quantity of tobacco, if\r\nthey are allowed a perfect freedom in the sale; and they will receive\r\nin payment, wines, oils, brandies, and manufactures, instead of coin;\r\nforcing each other, by their competition, to bring tobaccos of the\r\nbest quality; to give to the French manufacturer the full worth of\r\nhis merchandise, and to sell to the American consumer at the lowest\r\nprice they can afford; thus encouraging him to use, in preference, the\r\nmerchandise of this country.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that this exchange should be favored by any loss of\r\nrevenue to the King. I do not mean to urge anything which shall injure\r\neither his Majesty or his people. On the contrary, the measure I have\r\nthe honor of proposing, will increase his revenue, while it places both\r\nthe seller and buyer on a better footing. It is not for me to say, what\r\nsystem of collection may be best adapted to the organization of this\r\ngovernment; nor whether any useful hints may be taken from the practice\r\nof that country, which has heretofore been the principal entrepôt\r\nfor this commodity. Their system is simple and little expensive. The\r\nimporter, there, pays the whole duty to the King; and as this would\r\nbe inconvenient for him to do before he has sold his tobacco, he is\r\npermitted, on arrival, to deposit it in the King's warehouse, under the\r\nlocks of the King's officer. As soon as he has sold it, he goes with\r\nthe purchaser to the warehouse, the money is there divided between the\r\nKing and him, to each his proportion, and the purchaser takes out the\r\ntobacco. The payment of the King's duty is thus ensured in ready money.\r\nWhat is the expense of its collection, I cannot say; but it certainly\r\nneed not exceed six livres a hogshead of one thousand pounds. That\r\ngovernment levies a higher duty on tobacco than is levied here. Yet\r\nso tempting and so valuable is the perfect liberty of sale, that the\r\nmerchant carries it there, and finds his account in doing so.\r\n\r\nIf, by a simplification of the collection of the King's duty on\r\ntobacco, the cost of that collection can be reduced even to five per\r\ncent., or a million and a half, instead of twenty-five millions; the\r\nprice to the consumer will be reduced from three to two livres the\r\npound. For thus I calculate:\r\n\r\n     The cost, manufacture, and revenue, on twenty-four\r\n       million pounds of tobacco being (as before stated)   46,800,000\r\n                                                               livres.\r\n     Five per cent. on thirty millions of livres, expenses\r\n       of collection                                         1,500,000\r\n     Give what the consumers would pay, being about two     ----------\r\n       livres a pound                                       48,300,000\r\n     But they pay at present three livres a pound           72,000,000\r\n                                                            ----------\r\n     The difference is                                      23,700,000\r\n\r\nThe price, being thus reduced one-third, would be brought within\r\nthe reach of a new and numerous circle of the people, who cannot,\r\nat present, afford themselves this luxury. The consumption, then,\r\nwould probably increase, and perhaps, in the same if not a greater\r\nproportion, with the reduction of the price; that is to say, from\r\ntwenty-four to thirty-six millions of pounds; and the King, continuing\r\nto receive twenty-five sous on the pound, as at present, would receive\r\nforty-five instead of thirty millions of livres, while his subjects\r\nwould pay but two livres for an object which has heretofore cost them\r\nthree. Or if, in event, the consumption were not to be increased, he\r\nwould levy only forty-eight millions on his people, where seventy-two\r\nmillions are now levied, and would leave twenty-four millions in their\r\npockets, either to remain there, or to be levied in some other form,\r\nshould the state of revenue require it. It will enable his subjects,\r\nalso, to dispose of between nine and ten millions worth of their\r\nproduce and manufactures, instead of sending nearly that sum annually,\r\nin coin, to enrich a neighboring nation.\r\n\r\nI have heard two objections made to the suppression of this monopoly.\r\n1. That it might increase the importation of tobacco in contraband.\r\n2. That it would lessen the abilities of the Farmers General to make\r\noccasional loans of money to the public treasury. These objections will\r\nsurely be better answered by those who are better acquainted than I\r\nam with the details and circumstances of the country. With respect to\r\nthe first, however, I may observe, that contraband does not increase\r\non lessening the temptations to it. It is now encouraged by those who\r\nengage in it being able to sell for sixty sous what cost but fourteen,\r\nleaving a gain of forty-six sous. When the price shall be reduced from\r\nsixty to forty sous, the gain will be but twenty-six, that is to say,\r\na little more than one-half of what it is at present. It does not seem\r\na natural consequence then, that contraband should be increased by\r\nreducing its gain nearly one-half. As to the second objection, if we\r\nsuppose (for elucidation and without presuming to fix) the proportion\r\nof the farm on tobacco, at one-eighth of the whole mass farmed, the\r\nabilities of the Farmers General to lend, will be reduced one-eighth,\r\nthat is, they can hereafter lend only seven millions, where heretofore\r\nthey have lent eight. It is to be considered then, whether this eighth\r\n(or other proportion, whatever it be) is worth the annual sacrifice of\r\ntwenty-four millions, or if a much smaller sacrifice to other moneyed\r\nmen, will not produce the same loans of money in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nWhile the advantages of an increase of revenue to the crown, a\r\ndiminution of impost on the people, and a payment in merchandise,\r\ninstead of money, are conjectured as likely to result to France from\r\na suppression of the monopoly on tobacco, we have also reason to\r\nhope some advantages on our part; and this hope alone could justify\r\nmy entering into the present details. I do not expect this advantage\r\nwill be by any augmentation of price. The other markets of Europe have\r\ntoo much influence on this article to admit any sensible augmentation\r\nof price to take place. But the advantage I principally expect is an\r\nincrease of consumption. This will give us a vent for so much more,\r\nand, of consequence, find employment for so many more cultivators of\r\nthe earth; and in whatever proportion it increases this production\r\nfor us, in the same proportion will it procure additional vent for the\r\nmerchandise of France, and employment for the hands which produce it.\r\nI expect, too, that by bringing our merchants here, they would procure\r\na number of commodities in exchange, better in kind, and cheaper in\r\nprice. It is with sincerity I add, that warm feelings are indulged in\r\nmy breast by the further hope, that it would bind the two nations still\r\ncloser in friendship, by binding them in interest. In truth, no two\r\ncountries are better calculated for the exchanges of commerce. France\r\nwants rice, tobacco, potash, furs, and ship-timber. We want wines,\r\nbrandies, oils, and manufactures. There is an affection, too, between\r\nthe two people, which disposes them to favor one another. If they do\r\nnot come together, then, to make the exchanges in their own ports, it\r\nshows there is some substantial obstructions in the way. We have had\r\nthe benefit of too many proofs of his Majesty's friendly disposition\r\ntowards the United States, and know too well his affectionate\r\ncare of his own subjects, to doubt his willingness to remove these\r\nobstructions, if they can be unequivocally pointed out. It is for his\r\nwisdom to decide, whether the monopoly, which is the subject of this\r\nletter, be deservedly classed with the principal of these. It is a\r\ngreat comfort to me, too, that, in presenting this to the mind of his\r\nMajesty, your Excellency will correct my ideas where an insufficient\r\nknowledge of facts may have led me into error; and that, while the\r\ninterests of the King and of his people are the first objects of your\r\nattention, an additional one will be presented by those dispositions\r\ntoward us, which have heretofore so often befriended our nation.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion to repeat the assurance of that high\r\nrespect and esteem, with which I have the honor to be your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 17, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Mine of the 13th informed you that I had written to the M. de\r\nCastries on the subject of Puchilberg's interference. Yesterday I\r\nreceived his answer dated the 12th. In that he says that he is informed\r\nby the Ordonneteur that he has not been able to get an authentic roll\r\nof the crew of the Alliance, and that, in the probable case of there\r\nhaving been some French subjects among them, it will be just that\r\nyou should give security to repay their portions. I wrote to him this\r\nmorning, that as you have obliged yourself to transmit the money to\r\nthe treasury of the United States, it does not seem just to require you\r\nto be answerable for money which will be no longer within your power;\r\nthat the repayment of such portions will be incumbent on Congress;\r\nthat I will immediately solicit their orders to have all such claims\r\npaid by their banker here; and that, should any be presented before\r\nI receive their orders, I will undertake to direct the banker of the\r\nUnited States to pay them, that there may be no delay. I trust that\r\nthis will remove the difficulty, and that it is the last which will be\r\noffered. The ultimate answer shall be communicated the moment I receive\r\nit. Having pledged myself for the claims which may be offered before\r\nI receive the orders of Congress, it is necessary to arm myself with\r\nthe proper checks. Can you give me a roll of the crew, pointing out\r\nthe French subjects? If not, can you recollect personally the French\r\nsubjects, and name them to me, and the sums they are entitled to? If\r\nthere were none such, yet the roll will be material, because I have no\r\ndoubt that Puchilberg will excite claims upon me, either true or false.\r\n\r\n                     I am, with much respect, Sir,\r\n                         Your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 18, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of June the 22d, with a postscript of\r\nJuly the 14th. Yours of June the 27th came to hand the 23d of July,\r\nand that of July the 28th came to hand the 10th instant. The papers\r\nenclosed in the last shall be communicated to Mr. Adams. I see with\r\nextreme satisfaction and gratitude the friendly interposition of the\r\ncourt of Spain with the Emperor of Morocco on the subject of the brig\r\nBetsey, and I am persuaded it will produce the happiest effects in\r\nAmerica. Those, who are intrusted with the public affairs there, are\r\nsufficiently sensible how essential it is for our interest to cultivate\r\npeace with Spain, and they will be pleased to see a corresponding\r\ndisposition in that court. The late good office of emancipating a\r\nnumber of our countrymen from slavery is peculiarly calculated to\r\nproduce a sensation among our people, and to dispose them to relish and\r\nadopt the pacific and friendly views of their leaders towards Spain.\r\nWe hear nothing yet of Mr. Lambe. I have therefore lately proposed\r\nto Mr. Adams, that if he does not come in the French or English\r\npacket of this month, we will wait no longer. If he accedes to the\r\nproposition, you will be sure of hearing of, and, perhaps, of seeing\r\nsome agent proceeding on that business. The immense sum, said to have\r\nbeen proposed on the part of Spain to Algiers, leaves us little hope\r\nof satisfying their avarice. It may happen, then, that the interests\r\nof Spain and America may call for a concert of proceedings against\r\nthat State. The dispositions of the Emperor of Morocco give us better\r\nhopes there. May not the affairs of the Musquito coast, and our western\r\nports, produce another instance of a common interest? Indeed, I meet\r\nthis correspondence of interest in so many quarters, that I look with\r\nanxiety to the issue of Mr. Gardoqui's mission, hoping it will be a\r\nremoval of the only difficulty at present subsisting between the two\r\nnations, or which is likely to arise.\r\n\r\nCongress are not likely to adjourn this summer. They have purchased the\r\nIndian right of soil to about fifty millions of acres of land between\r\nthe Ohio and lakes, and expected to make another purchase of an equal\r\nquantity. They have, in consequence, passed an ordinance for disposing\r\nof their lands, and I think a very judicious one. They propose to sell\r\nthem at auction for not less than a dollar an acre, receiving their own\r\ncertificates of debt as money. I am of opinion, all the certificates\r\nof our domestic debt will immediately be exchanged for land. Our\r\nforeign debt, in that case, will soon be discharged. New York and Rhode\r\nIsland still refuse the impost. A general disposition is taking place\r\nto commit the whole management of our commerce to Congress. This has\r\nbeen much promoted by the interested policy of England, which, it was\r\napparent, could not be counter-worked by the States separately. In\r\nthe meantime, the other great towns are acceding to the proceedings\r\nof Boston for annihilating, in a great measure, their commercial\r\nconnections with Great Britain. I will send the cypher by a gentleman,\r\nwho goes from here to Madrid about a month hence. It shall be a copy of\r\nthe one I gave Mr. Adams. The letter of Don Gomez has been delivered\r\nat the hotel of the Portuguese ambassador, who is, however, in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n                   I am, with much respect, dear Sir,\r\n                       Your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. TRIST.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, August 18,1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am much pleased with the people of this country. The roughness of the\r\nhuman mind are so thoroughly rubbed off with them, that it seems as\r\nif one might glide through a whole life among them without a jostle.\r\nPerhaps, too, their manners may be the best calculated for happiness\r\nto a people in their situation, but I am convinced they fall far short\r\nof effecting a happiness so temperate, so uniform, and so lasting as is\r\ngenerally enjoyed with us. The domestic bonds here are absolutely done\r\naway, and where can their compensation be found? Perhaps they may catch\r\nsome moments of transport above the level of the ordinary tranquil joy\r\nwe experience, but they are separated by long intervals, during which\r\nall the passions are at sea without rudder or compass. Yet, fallacious\r\nas the pursuits of happiness are, they seem on the whole to furnish\r\nthe most effectual abstraction from a contemplation of the hardness\r\nof their government. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive how so good\r\na people, with so good a King, so well-disposed rulers in general, so\r\ngenial a climate, so fertile a soil, should be rendered so ineffectual\r\nfor producing human happiness by one single curse,--that of a bad form\r\nof government. But it is a fact, in spite of the mildness of their\r\ngovernors, the people are ground to powder by the vices of the form of\r\ngovernment. Of twenty millions of people supposed to be in France, I\r\nam of opinion there are nineteen millions more wretched, more accursed\r\nin every circumstance of human existence than the most conspicuously\r\nwretched individual of the whole United States. I beg your pardon\r\nfor getting into politics. I will add only one sentiment more of that\r\ncharacter, that is, nourish peace with their persons, but war against\r\ntheir manners. Every step we take towards the adoption of their manners\r\nis a step to perfect misery. I pray you to write to me often. Do not\r\nyou turn politician too; but write me all the small news--the news\r\nabout persons and about states; tell me who dies, that I may meet these\r\ndisagreeable events in detail, and not all at once when I return; who\r\nmarry, who hang themselves because they cannot marry, &c. Present me in\r\nthe most friendly terms to Mrs. House and Browse, and be assured of the\r\nsincerity with which I am, dear Madam,\r\n\r\n                 Your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PETER CARR.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 19, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR PETER,--I received, by Mr. Mazzei, your letter of April the 20th.\r\nI am much mortified to hear that you have lost so much time; and that,\r\nwhen you arrived in Williamsburg, you were not at all advanced from\r\nwhat you were when you left Monticello. Time now begins to be precious\r\nto you. Every day you lose will retard a day your entrance on that\r\npublic stage whereon you may begin to be useful to yourself. However,\r\nthe way to repair the loss is to improve the future time. I trust,\r\nthat with your dispositions, even the acquisition of science is a\r\npleasing employment. I can assure you, that the possession of it is,\r\nwhat (next to an honest heart) will above all things render you dear\r\nto your friends, and give you fame and promotion in your own country.\r\nWhen your mind shall be well improved with science, nothing will be\r\nnecessary to place you in the highest points of view, but to pursue\r\nthe interests of your country, the interests of your friends, and your\r\nown interests also, with the purest integrity, the most chaste honor.\r\nThe defect of these virtues can never be made up by all the other\r\nacquirements of body and mind. Make these, then, your first object.\r\nGive up money, give up fame, give up science, give the earth itself and\r\nall it contains, rather than do an immoral act. And never suppose, that\r\nin any possible situation, or under any circumstances, it is best for\r\nyou to do a dishonorable thing, however slightly so it may appear to\r\nyou. Whenever you are to do a thing, though it can never be known but\r\nto yourself, ask yourself how you would act were all the world looking\r\nat you, and act accordingly. Encourage all your virtuous dispositions,\r\nand exercise them whenever an opportunity arises; being assured that\r\nthey will gain strength by exercise, as a limb of the body does, and\r\nthat exercise will make them habitual. From the practice of the purest\r\nvirtue, you may be assured you will derive the most sublime comforts\r\nin every moment of life, and in the moment of death. If ever you find\r\nyourself environed with difficulties and perplexing circumstances, out\r\nof which you are at a loss how to extricate yourself, do what is right,\r\nand be assured that that will extricate you the best out of the worst\r\nsituations. Though you cannot see, when you take one step, what will\r\nbe the next, yet follow truth, justice, and plain dealing, and never\r\nfear their leading you out of the labyrinth, in the easiest manner\r\npossible. The knot which you thought a Gordian one, will untie itself\r\nbefore you. Nothing is so mistaken as the supposition, that a person\r\nis to extricate himself from a difficulty, by intrigue, by chicanery,\r\nby dissimulation, by trimming, by an untruth, by an injustice. This\r\nincreases the difficulties ten-fold; and those, who pursue these\r\nmethods, get themselves so involved at length, that they can turn no\r\nway but their infamy becomes more exposed. It is of great importance\r\nto set a resolution, not to be shaken, never to tell an untruth. There\r\nis no vice so mean, so pitiful, so contemptible; and he who permits\r\nhimself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second\r\nand third time, till at length it becomes habitual; he tells lies\r\nwithout attending to it, and truths without the world's believing him.\r\nThis falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart, and in time\r\ndepraves all its good dispositions.\r\n\r\nAn honest heart being the first blessing, a knowing head is the second.\r\nIt is time for you now to begin to be choice in your reading; to begin\r\nto pursue a regular course in it; and not to suffer yourself to be\r\nturned to the right or left by reading anything out of that course.\r\nI have long ago digested a plan for you, suited to the circumstances\r\nin which you will be placed. This I will detail to you, from time to\r\ntime, as you advance. For the present, I advise you to begin a course\r\nof ancient history, reading everything in the original and not in\r\ntranslations. First read Goldsmith's history of Greece. This will give\r\nyou a digested view of that field. Then take up ancient history in the\r\ndetail, reading the following books, in the following order: Herodotus,\r\nThucydides, Xenophontis Anabasis, Arrian, Quintus Curtius, Diodorus\r\nSiculus, Justin. This shall form the first stage of your historical\r\nreading, and is all I need mention to you now. The next will be of\r\nRoman history.[114] From that, we will come down to modern history. In\r\nGreek and Latin poetry, you have read or will read at school, Virgil,\r\nTerence, Horace, Anacreon, Theocritus, Homer, Euripides, Sophocles.\r\nRead also Milton's Paradise Lost, Shakspeare, Ossian, Pope's and\r\nSwift's works, in order to form your style in your own language. In\r\nmorality, read Epictetus, Xenophontis Memorabilia, Plato's Socratic\r\ndialogues, Cicero's philosophies, Antoninus, and Seneca. In order to\r\nassure a certain progress in this reading, consider what hours you\r\nhave free from the school and the exercises of the school. Give about\r\ntwo of them, every day, to exercise; for health must not be sacrificed\r\nto learning. A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species\r\nof exercise, I advise the gun. While this gives a moderate exercise\r\nto the body, it gives boldness, enterprise, and independence to the\r\nmind. Games played with the ball, and others of that nature, are too\r\nviolent for the body, and stamp no character on the mind. Let your\r\ngun, therefore, be the constant companion of your walks. Never think\r\nof taking a book with you. The object of walking is to relax the mind.\r\nYou should therefore not permit yourself even to think while you walk;\r\nbut divert yourself by the objects surrounding you. Walking is the best\r\npossible exercise. Habituate yourself to walk very far. The Europeans\r\nvalue themselves on having subdued the horse to the uses of man; but\r\nI doubt whether we have not lost more than we have gained, by the use\r\nof this animal. No one has occasioned so much the degeneracy of the\r\nhuman body. An Indian goes on foot nearly as far in a day, for a long\r\njourney, as an enfeebled white does on his horse; and he will tire\r\nthe best horses. There is no habit you will value so much as that of\r\nwalking far without fatigue. I would advise you to take your exercise\r\nin the afternoon: not because it is the best time for exercise, for\r\ncertainly it is not; but because it is the best time to spare from\r\nyour studies; and habit will soon reconcile it to health, and render\r\nit nearly as useful as if you gave to that the more precious hours of\r\nthe day. A little walk of half an hour, in the morning, when you first\r\nrise, is advisable also. It shakes off sleep, and produces other good\r\neffects in the animal economy. Rise at a fixed and an early hour, and\r\ngo to bed at a fixed and early hour also. Sitting up late at night is\r\ninjurious to the health, and not useful to the mind. Having ascribed\r\nproper hours to exercise, divide what remain (I mean of your vacant\r\nhours) into three portions. Give the principal to History, the other\r\ntwo, which should be shorter, to Philosophy and Poetry. Write to me\r\nonce every month or two, and let me know the progress you make. Tell\r\nme in what manner you employ every hour in the day. The plan I have\r\nproposed for you is adapted to your present situation only. When that\r\nis changed, I shall propose a corresponding change of plan. I have\r\nordered the following books to be sent to you from London, to the\r\ncare of Mr. Madison: Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon's Hellenics,\r\nAnabasis and Memorabilia, Cicero's works, Baretti's Spanish and English\r\nDictionary, Martin's Philosophical Grammar, and Martin's Philosophia\r\nBritannica. I will send you the following from hence: Bezout's\r\nMathematics, De la Lande's Astronomy, Muschenbrock's Physics, Quintus\r\nCurtius, Justin, a Spanish Grammar, and some Spanish books. You will\r\nobserve that Martin, Bezout, De la Lande, and Muschenbrock, are not\r\nin the preceding plan. They are not to be opened till you go to the\r\nUniversity. You are now, I expect, learning French. You must push this;\r\nbecause the books which will be put into your hands when you advance\r\ninto Mathematics, Natural philosophy, Natural history, &c., will be\r\nmostly French, these sciences being better treated by the French than\r\nthe English writers. Our future connection with Spain renders that\r\nthe most necessary of the modern languages, after the French. When you\r\nbecome a public man, you may have occasion for it, and the circumstance\r\nof your possessing that language, may give you a preference over other\r\ncandidates. I have nothing further to add for the present, but husband\r\nwell your time, cherish your instructors, strive to make everybody your\r\nfriend; and be assured that nothing will be so pleasing as your success\r\nto, Dear Peter,\r\n\r\n                         Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 20, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR PAGE,--I received your friendly letter of April the 28th, by Mr.\r\nMazzei, on the 22d of July. That of the month before, by Monsieur\r\nle Croix, has not come to hand. This correspondence is grateful to\r\nsome of my warmest feelings, as the friendships of my youth are those\r\nwhich adhere closest to me, and in which I most confide. My principal\r\nhappiness is now in the retrospect of life.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your notes of your operations on the Pennsylvania\r\nboundary. I am in hopes that from yourself, Madison, Rittenhouse or\r\nHutchings, I shall receive a chart of the line as actually run. It\r\nwill be a great present to me. I think Hutchings promised to send it\r\nto me. I have been much pleased to hear you had it in contemplation,\r\nto endeavor to establish Rittenhouse in our College. This would be an\r\nimmense acquisition, and would draw youth to it from every part of the\r\ncontinent. You will do much more honor to our society, on reviving it,\r\nby placing him at its head, than so useless a member as I should be. I\r\nhave been so long diverted from this my favorite line, and that, too,\r\nwithout acquiring an attachment to my adopted one, that I am become\r\na mongrel, of no decided order, unowned by any, and incapable of\r\nserving any. I should feel myself out of my true place too, to stand\r\nbefore McLurg. But why withdraw yourself? You have more zeal, more\r\napplication, and more constant attention to the subjects proper to the\r\nsociety, and can therefore, serve them best.\r\n\r\nThe affair of the Emperor and Dutch is settled, though not signed.\r\nThe particulars have not yet transpired. That of the Bavarian exchange\r\nis dropped, and his views on Venice defeated. The alliance of Russia\r\nwith Venice, to prevent his designs in that quarter, and that of the\r\nHanoverian Elector with the King of Prussia and other members of the\r\nGermanic body, to prevent his acquisition of Bavaria, leave him in\r\na solitary situation. In truth, he has lost much reputation by his\r\nlate manœuvres. He is a restless, ambitious character, aiming\r\nat everything, persevering in nothing, taking up designs without\r\ncalculating the force which will be opposed to him, and dropping\r\nthem on the appearance of firm opposition. He has some just views,\r\nand much activity. The only quarter in which the peace of Europe\r\nseems at present capable of being disturbed, is on that of the\r\nPorte. It is believed that the Emperor and Empress have schemes in\r\ncontemplation, for driving the Turks out of Europe. Were this with\r\na view to re-establish the native Greeks in the sovereignty of their\r\nown country, I could wish them success, and to see driven from that\r\ndelightful country a set of barbarians, with whom an opposition to all\r\nscience is an article of religion. The modern Greek is not yet so far\r\ndeparted from its ancient model, but that we might still hope to see\r\nthe language of Homer and Demosthenes flow with purity, from the lips\r\nof a free and ingenious people. But these powers have in object to\r\ndivide the country between themselves. This is only to substitute one\r\nset of barbarians for another, breaking, at the same time, the balance\r\namong the European powers. You have been told, with truth, that the\r\nEmperor of Morocco has shown a disposition to enter into treaty with\r\nus; but not truly, that Congress has not attended to his advances, and\r\nthereby disgusted him. It is long since they took measures to meet his\r\nadvances. But some unlucky incidents have delayed their effect. His\r\ndispositions continue good. As a proof of this, he has lately released\r\nfreely, and clothed well, the crew of an American brig he took last\r\nwinter; the only vessel ever taken from us by any of the States of\r\nBarbary. But what is the English of these good dispositions? Plainly\r\nthis; he is ready to receive us into the number of his tributaries.\r\nWhat will be the amount of tribute, remains yet to be known, but it\r\nprobably will not be as small as you may have conjectured. It will\r\nsurely be more than a free people ought to pay to a power owning only\r\nfour or five frigates, under twenty-two guns: he has not a port into\r\nwhich a larger vessel can enter. The Algerines possess fifteen or\r\ntwenty frigates, from that size up to fifty guns. Disinclination on\r\ntheir part, has lately broken off a treaty between Spain and them,\r\nwhereon they were to have received a million of dollars, besides great\r\npresents in naval stores. What sum they intend we shall pay, I cannot\r\nsay. Then follow Tunis and Tripoli. You will probably find the tribute\r\nto all these powers make such a proportion of the federal taxes, as\r\nthat every man will feel them sensibly, when he pays those taxes.\r\nThe question is, whether their peace or war will be cheapest? But it\r\nis a question which should be addressed to our honor, as well as our\r\navarice. Nor does it respect us as to these pirates only, but as to the\r\nnations of Europe. If we wish our commerce to be free and uninsulted,\r\nwe must let these nations see, that we have an energy which at present\r\nthey disbelieve. The low opinion they entertain of our powers, cannot\r\nfail to involve us soon, in a naval war.\r\n\r\nI shall send you with this, if I can, and if not, then by the first\r\ngood conveyance, the Connoissance de tems for the years 1786 and 1787,\r\nbeing all as yet published. You will find in these the tables for the\r\nplanet Herschel, as far as the observations hitherto made, admit them\r\nto be calculated. You will see, also, that Herschel was only the first\r\nastronomer who discovered it to be a planet, and not the first who saw\r\nit. Mayer saw it in the year 1756, and placed it in the catalogue of\r\nhis zodiacal stars, supposing it to be such. A Prussian astronomer,\r\nin the year 1781, observed that the 964th star of Mayer's catalogue\r\nwas missing; and the calculations now prove that at the time Mayer\r\nsaw his 964th star, the planet Herschel should have been precisely in\r\nthe place where he noted that star. I shall send you also a little\r\npublication here, called the Bibliothéque Physico-œconomique. It\r\nwill communicate all the improvements and new discoveries in the arts\r\nand sciences, made in Europe for some years past. I shall be happy to\r\nhear from you often. Details, political and literary, and even of the\r\nsmall history of our country, are the most pleasing communications\r\npossible. Present me affectionately to Mrs. Page, and to your family,\r\nin the members of which, though unknown to me, I feel an interest on\r\naccount of their parents. Believe me to be with warm esteem, dear Page,\r\nyour sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 22, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I was honored yesterday with your Excellency's letter of June\r\nthe 16th, enclosing the resolution of Assembly relative to the bust of\r\nthe M. de La Fayette. I shall render cheerfully any services I can in\r\naid of Mr. Barclay for carrying this resolution into effect. The M.\r\nde La Fayette being to pass into Germany and Prussia, it was thought\r\nproper to take the model of his bust in plaister before his departure.\r\nMonsieur Houdon was engaged to do it, and did it accordingly. So far\r\nMr. Barclay had thought himself authorized to go in consequence of\r\norders formerly received. You will be so good as to instruct me as\r\nto the moneys hereafter to be remitted to me, whether I am to apply\r\nthem solely to the statue of General Washington, or to that, and the\r\nMarquis's bust in common, as shall be necessary. Supposing you wish to\r\nknow the application of the money's remitted from time to time, I state\r\nhereon an account thereof so far as I am able at present. Before your\r\nreceipt of this letter I am in hopes mine of July 11th, by Monsieur\r\nHoudon, will have come to your hands; in that I enclosed you a copy of\r\nthe contract with him.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with due respect, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                          TH: JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                     (Private.)  PARIS, August 23, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I shall sometimes ask your permission to write you letters,\r\nnot official, but private. The present is of this kind, and is\r\noccasioned by the question proposed in yours of June the 14th; \"whether\r\nit would be useful to us, to carry all our own productions, or none?\"\r\n\r\nWere we perfectly free to decide this question, I should reason as\r\nfollows. We have now lands enough to employ an infinite number of\r\npeople in their cultivation. Cultivators of the earth are the most\r\nvaluable citizens. They are the most vigorous, the most independent,\r\nthe most virtuous, and they are tied to their country, and wedded\r\nto its liberty and interests, by the most lasting bonds. As long,\r\ntherefore, as they can find employment in this line, I would not\r\nconvert them into mariners, artisans, or anything else. But our\r\ncitizens will find employment in this line, till their numbers, and\r\nof course their productions, become too great for the demand, both\r\ninternal and foreign. This is not the case as yet, and probably will\r\nnot be for a considerable time. As soon as it is, the surplus of hands\r\nmust be turned to something else. I should then, perhaps, wish to turn\r\nthem to the sea in preference to manufactures; because, comparing the\r\ncharacters of the two classes, I find the former the most valuable\r\ncitizens. I consider the class of artificers as the panders of vice,\r\nand the instruments by which the liberties of a country are generally\r\noverturned. However, we are not free to decide this question on\r\nprinciples of theory only. Our people are decided in the opinion, that\r\nit is necessary for us to take a share in the occupation of the ocean,\r\nand their established habits induce them to require that the sea be\r\nkept open to them, and that that line of policy be pursued, which will\r\nrender the use of that element to them as great as possible. I think\r\nit a duty in those entrusted with the administration of their affairs,\r\nto conform themselves to the decided choice of their constituents; and\r\nthat therefore, we should, in every instance, preserve an equality of\r\nright to them in the transportation of commodities, in the right of\r\nfishing, and in the other uses of the sea.\r\n\r\nBut what will be the consequence? Frequent wars without a doubt.\r\nTheir property will be violated on the sea, and in foreign ports,\r\ntheir persons will be insulted, imprisoned, &c., for pretended debts,\r\ncontracts, crimes, contraband, &c., &c. These insults must be resented,\r\neven if we had no feelings, yet to prevent their eternal repetition;\r\nor, in other words, our commerce on the ocean and in other countries,\r\nmust be paid for by frequent war. The justest dispositions possible in\r\nourselves, will not secure us against it. It would be necessary that\r\nall other nations were just also. Justice indeed, on our part, will\r\nsave us from those wars which would have been produced by a contrary\r\ndisposition. But how can we prevent those produced by the wrongs of\r\nother nations? By putting ourselves in a condition to punish them.\r\nWeakness provokes insult and injury, while a condition to punish, often\r\nprevents them. This reasoning leads to the necessity of some naval\r\nforce; that being the only weapon by which we can reach an enemy. I\r\nthink it to our interest to punish the first insult; because an insult\r\nunpunished is the parent of many others. We are not, at this moment,\r\nin a condition to do it, but we should put ourselves into it, as soon\r\nas possible. If a war with England should take place, it seems to me\r\nthat the first thing necessary would be a resolution to abandon the\r\ncarrying trade, because we cannot protect it. Foreign nations must,\r\nin that case, be invited to bring us what we want, and to take our\r\nproductions in their own bottoms. This alone could prevent the loss\r\nof those productions to us, and the acquisition of them to our enemy.\r\nOur seamen might be employed in depredations on their trade. But how\r\ndreadfully we shall suffer on our coasts, if we have no force on the\r\nwater, former experience has taught us. Indeed, I look forward with\r\nhorror to the very possible case of war with an European power, and\r\nthink there is no protection against them, but from the possession of\r\nsome force on the sea. Our vicinity to their West India possessions,\r\nand to the fisheries, is a bridle which a small naval force, on our\r\npart, would hold in the mouths of the most powerful of these countries.\r\nI hope our land office will rid us of our debts, and that our first\r\nattention then, will be, to the beginning a naval force of some sort.\r\nThis alone can countenance our people as carriers on the water, and I\r\nsuppose them to be determined to continue such.\r\n\r\nI wrote you two public letters on the 14th instant, since which I have\r\nreceived yours of July the 13th. I shall always be pleased to receive\r\nfrom you, in a private way, such communications as you might not choose\r\nto put into a public letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS. August 28, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 5th of July, by Mr. Franklin and on the\r\n12th of the same month, by Monsieur Houdon. Since that date, yours of\r\nJune the 16th, by Mazzei, has been received. Everything looks like\r\npeace here. The settlement between the Emperor and the Dutch is not\r\nyet published, but it is believed to be agreed on. Nothing is done, as\r\nyet, between him and the Porte. He is much wounded by the confederation\r\nof several of the Germanic body, at the head of which is the King\r\nof Prussia, and to which the King of England, as Elector of Hanover,\r\nis believed to accede. The object is to preserve the constitution of\r\nthat empire. It shows that these princes entertain serious jealousies\r\nof the ambition of the Emperor, and this will very much endanger\r\nthe election of his nephew as King of the Romans. A late _Arret_ of\r\nthis court against the admission of British manufactures produces\r\na great sensation in England. I wish it may produce a disposition\r\nthere to receive our commerce in all their dominions, on advantageous\r\nterms. This is the only balm which can heal the wounds that it has\r\nreceived. It is but too true, that that country furnished markets for\r\nthree-fourths of the exports of the eight northern-most States. A truth\r\nnot proper to be spoken of, but which should influence our proceedings\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe July French packet having arrived without bringing any news of Mr.\r\nLambe, if the English one of the same month be also arrived, without\r\nnews of him, I expect Mr. Adams will concur with me in sending some\r\nother person to treat with the Barbary States. Mr. Barclay is willing\r\nto go, and I have proposed him to Mr. Adams, but have not yet received\r\nhis answer. The peace expected between Spain and Algiers, will probably\r\nnot take place. It is said, the former was to have given a million of\r\ndollars. Would it not be prudent to send a minister to Portugal? Our\r\ncommerce with that country is very important; perhaps more so than\r\nwith any other country in Europe. It is possible, too, that they might\r\npermit our whaling vessels to refresh in Brazil, or give some other\r\nindulgences in America. The lethargic character of their ambassador\r\nhere gives a very unhopeful aspect to a treaty on this ground. I lately\r\nspoke with him on the subject, and he has promised to interest himself\r\nin obtaining an answer from his court.\r\n\r\nI have waited to see what was the pleasure of Congress, as to the\r\nsecretaryship of my office here; that is, to see whether they proposed\r\nto appoint a secretary of legation, or leave me to appoint a private\r\nsecretary. Colonel Humphreys' occupation in the despatches and records\r\nof the matters which relate to the general commissions, does not afford\r\nhim leisure to aid me in my office, were I entitled to ask that aid. In\r\nthe meantime, the long papers, which often accompany the communications\r\nbetween the ministers here, and myself, and the other business of the\r\noffice, absolutely require a scribe. I shall, therefore, on Mr. Short's\r\nreturn from the Hague, appoint him my private secretary, till Congress\r\nshall think proper to signify their pleasure. The salary allowed Mr.\r\nFranklin in the same office, was one thousand dollars a year. I shall\r\npresume that Mr. Short may draw the same allowance from the funds of\r\nthe United States here. As soon as I shall have made this appointment,\r\nI shall give official notice of it to Mr. Jay, that Congress may, if\r\nthey disapprove it, say so.\r\n\r\nI am much pleased with your land ordinance, and think it improved from\r\nthe first, in the most material circumstances. I had mistaken the\r\nobject of the division of the lands among the States. I am sanguine\r\nin my expectations of lessening our debts by this fund, and have\r\nexpressed my expectations to the minister and others here. I see by the\r\npublic papers, you have adopted the dollar as your money unit. In the\r\narrangement of coins I proposed, I ought to have inserted a gold coin\r\nof five dollars, which, being within two shillings of the value of a\r\nguinea, would be very convenient.\r\n\r\nThe English papers are so incessantly repeating their lies about the\r\ntumults, the anarchy, the bankruptcies and distresses of America,\r\nthat these ideas prevail very generally in Europe. At a large table\r\nwhere I dined the other day, a gentleman from Switzerland expressed\r\nhis apprehensions for the fate of Dr. Franklin, as he said he had\r\nbeen informed, that he would be received with stones by the people,\r\nwho were generally dissatisfied with the Revolution, and incensed\r\nagainst all those who had assisted in bringing it about. I told him his\r\napprehensions were just, and that the people of America would probably\r\nsalute Dr. Franklin with the same stones they had thrown at the Marquis\r\nFayette. The reception of the Doctor is an object of very general\r\nattention, and will weigh in Europe, as an evidence of the satisfaction\r\nor dissatisfaction of America, with their Revolution. As you are to\r\nbe in Williamsburg early in November, this is the last letter I shall\r\nwrite you till about that time.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 30, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of writing to you on the 14th instant, by a Mr.\r\nCannon of Connecticut, who was to sail in the packet. Since that date,\r\nyours of July 13th has come to hand. The times for the sailing of the\r\npackets being somewhat deranged, I avail myself of a conveyance for\r\nthe present, by the Mr. Fitzhughs of Virginia, who expect to land at\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a correspondence which has taken place between the\r\nMarechal de Castries, minister of the Marine, and myself. It is on\r\nthe subject of the prize money due to the officers and crew of the\r\nAlliance, for prizes taken in Europe, under the command of Captain\r\nJones. That officer has been here, under the direction of Congress,\r\nnear two years, soliciting the liquidation and payment of that money.\r\nInfinite delays had retarded the liquidation till the month of June. It\r\nwas expected, when the liquidation was announced to be completed, that\r\nthe money was to be received. The M. de Castries doubted the authority\r\nof Captain Jones to receive it, and wrote to me for information. I\r\nwrote him the letter dated July the 10th, which seemed to clear away\r\nthat difficulty. Another arose. A Mr. Puchilberg presented powers to\r\nreceive the money. I wrote, then, the letter of August the 3d, and\r\nreceived that of the M. de Castries, of August the 12th, acknowledging\r\nhe was satisfied as to this difficulty, but announcing another; to\r\nwit, that possibly some French subjects might have been on board the\r\nAlliance, and, therefore, that Captain Jones ought to give security\r\nfor the repayment of their portions. Captain Jones had before told\r\nme there was not a Frenchman on board that vessel, but the Captain. I\r\ninquired of Mr. Barclay. He told me he was satisfied there was not one.\r\nHere then, was a mere possibility, a shadow of a right, opposed to a\r\ncertain, to a substantial one which existed in the mass of the crew,\r\nand which was likely to be delayed; for it was not to be expected that\r\nCaptain Jones could, in a strange country, find the security required.\r\nThese difficulties I suppose to have been conjured up, one after\r\nanother, by Mr. Puchilberg, who wanted to get hold of the money. I saw\r\nbut one way to cut short these everlasting delays, which were ruining\r\nthe officer soliciting the payment of the money, and keeping our\r\nseamen out of what they had hardly fought for, years ago. This was, to\r\nundertake to ask an order from Congress, for the payment of any French\r\nclaimants by their banker in Paris; and, in the meantime, to undertake\r\nto order such payment, should any such claimant prove his title, before\r\nthe pleasure of Congress should be made known to me. I consulted with\r\nMr. Barclay, who seemed satisfied I might venture this undertaking,\r\nbecause no such claim could be presented. I therefore wrote the letter\r\nof August the 17th, and received that of August the 26th, finally\r\nclosing this tedious business. Should what I have done not meet the\r\napprobation of Congress, I would pray their immediate sense, because it\r\nis not probable that the whole of this money will be paid so hastily,\r\nbut that their orders may arrive in time, to stop a sufficiency for\r\nany French claimants who may possibly exist. The following paragraph\r\nof a letter from Captain Jones, dated L'Orient, August the 25th, 1785,\r\nfurther satisfies me that my undertaking amounted to nothing in fact.\r\nHe says, \"it is impossible that any legal demands should be made on you\r\nfor French subjects, in consequence of your engagement to the Marechal.\r\nThe Alliance was manned in America, and I never heard of any persons\r\nhaving served on board that frigate, who had been born in France,\r\nexcept the captain, who, as I was informed, had, in America, abjured\r\nthe church of Rome, and been naturalized.\" Should Congress approve\r\nwhat I have done, I will then ask their resolution for the payment, by\r\ntheir banker here, of any such claims as may be properly authenticated,\r\nand will moreover pray of you an authentic roll of the crew of the\r\nAlliance, with the sums to be allowed to each person; on the subject\r\nof which roll, Captain Jones, in the letter above mentioned, says, \"I\r\ncarried a set of the rolls with me to America, and, before I embarked\r\nin the French fleet at Boston, I put them into the hands of Mr.\r\nSecretary Livingston, and they were sealed up among the papers of his\r\noffice when I left America.\" I think it possible that Mr. Puchilberg\r\nmay excite claims. Should any name be offered which shall not be\r\nfound on the roll, it will be a sufficient disproof of the pretension.\r\nShould it be found on the roll, it will remain to prove the identity of\r\nperson, and to inquire if payment may not have been made in America.\r\nI conjecture, from the journals of Congress of June 2d, that Landais,\r\nwho, I believe, was the captain, may be in America. As his portion of\r\nthe prize may be considerable, I hope it will be settled in America,\r\nwhere only it can be known whether any advances have been made him.\r\n\r\nThe person at the head of the post office here says, he proposed\r\nto Dr. Franklin a convention to facilitate the passage of letters\r\nthrough their office and ours, and that he delivered a draught of\r\nthe convention proposed, that it might be sent to Congress. I think\r\nit possible he may be mistaken in this, as, on my mentioning it to\r\nDr. Franklin, he did not recollect any such draught having been put\r\ninto his hands. An answer, however, is expected by them. I mention\r\nit, that Congress may decide whether they will make any convention on\r\nthe subject, and on what principle. The one proposed here was, that,\r\nfor letters passing hence into America, the French postage should\r\nbe collected by our post officers, and paid every six months, and\r\nfor letters coming from America here, the American postage should be\r\ncollected by the post officers here, and paid to us in like manner.\r\nA second plan, however, presents itself; that is, to suppose the sums\r\nto be thus collected, on each side, will be equal, or so nearly equal,\r\nthat the balance will not pay for the trouble of keeping accounts, and\r\nfor the little bickerings that the settlement of accounts, and demands\r\nof the balances, may occasion; and therefore, to make an exchange of\r\npostage. This would better secure our harmony; but I do not know that\r\nit would be agreed to here. If not, the other might then be agreed to.\r\n\r\nI have waited hitherto, supposing that Congress might, possibly,\r\nappoint a secretary to the legation here, or signify their pleasure\r\nthat I should appoint a private secretary, to aid me in my office.\r\nThe communication between the ministers and myself, requiring often\r\nthat many and long papers should be copied, and that, in a shorter\r\ntime than could be done by myself, were I otherwise unoccupied,\r\nother correspondences and proceedings, of all which copies must be\r\nretained, and still more the necessity of having some confidential\r\nperson, who, in case of any accident to myself, might be authorized\r\nto take possession of the instructions, letters, and other papers of\r\nthe office, have rendered it absolutely necessary for me to appoint\r\na private secretary. Colonel Humphreys finds full occupation, and\r\noften more than he can do, in writing and recording the despatches and\r\nproceedings of the general commissions. I shall, therefore, appoint Mr.\r\nShort, on his return from the Hague, with an express condition, that\r\nthe appointment shall cease whenever Congress shall think proper to\r\nmake any other arrangement. He will, of course, expect the allowance\r\nheretofore made to the private secretaries of the ministers, which, I\r\nbelieve, has been a thousand dollars a year.\r\n\r\nAn improvement is made here in the construction of muskets, which it\r\nmay be interesting to Congress to know, should they at any time propose\r\nto procure any. It consists in the making every part of them so exactly\r\nalike, that what belongs to any one, may be used for every other musket\r\nin the magazine. The government here has examined and approved the\r\nmethod, and is establishing a large manufactory for the purpose of\r\nputting it into execution. As yet, the inventor has only completed the\r\nlock of the musket, on this plan. He will proceed immediately to have\r\nthe barrel, stock, and other parts, executed in the same way. Supposing\r\nit might be useful in the United States, I went to the workman. He\r\npresented me the parts of fifty locks taken to pieces, and arranged in\r\ncompartments. I put several together myself, taking pieces at hazard\r\nas they came to hand, and they fitted in the most perfect manner. The\r\nadvantages of this, when arms need repair, are evident. He effects it\r\nby tools of his own contrivance, which, at the same time, abridge the\r\nwork, so that he thinks he shall be able to furnish the musket two\r\nlivres cheaper than the common price. But it will be two or three years\r\nbefore he will be able to furnish any quantity. I mention it now, as\r\nit may have an influence on the plan for furnishing our magazines with\r\nthis arm.\r\n\r\nEverything in Europe remains as when I wrote you last. The peace\r\nbetween Spain and Algiers has the appearance of being broken off. The\r\nFrench packet having arrived without Mr. Lambe, or any news of him, I\r\nawait Mr. Adams's acceding to the proposition mentioned in my last. I\r\nsend you the gazettes of Leyden and France to this date, and have the\r\nhonor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, Sir,\r\n\r\n                   Your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, September 1, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you by Monsieur de Doradour was dated May the\r\n11th. Since that, I have received yours of January the 22d, with six\r\ncopies of the revisal, and that of April the 27th, by Mr. Mazzei.\r\n\r\nAll is quiet here. The Emperor and Dutch have certainly agreed, though\r\nthey have not published their agreement. Most of his schemes in Germany\r\nmust be postponed, if they are not prevented by the confederacy of many\r\nof the Germanic body, at the head of which is the King of Prussia, and\r\nto which the Elector of Hanover is supposed to have acceded. The object\r\nof the league is to preserve the members of the empire in their present\r\nstate. I doubt whether the jealousy entertained of this prince, and\r\nwhich is so fully evidenced by this league, may not defeat the election\r\nof his nephew to be King of the Romans, and thus produce an instance\r\nof breaking the lineal succession. Nothing is as yet done between him\r\nand the Turks. If anything is produced in that quarter, it will not\r\nbe for this year. The court of Madrid has obtained the delivery of the\r\ncrew of the brig Betsey, taken by the Emperor of Morocco. The Emperor\r\nhad treated them kindly, new clothed them, and delivered them to the\r\nSpanish minister, who sent them to Cadiz. This is the only American\r\nvessel ever taken by the Barbary States. The Emperor continues to\r\ngive proofs of his desire to be in friendship with us, or, in other\r\nwords, of receiving us into the number of his tributaries. Nothing\r\nfurther need be feared from him. I wish the Algerines may be as easily\r\ndealt with. I fancy the peace expected between them and Spain is not\r\nlikely to take place. I am well informed that the late proceedings in\r\nAmerica, have produced a wonderful sensation in England in our favor.\r\nI mean the disposition which seems to be becoming general, to invest\r\nCongress with the regulation of our commerce, and, in the meantime,\r\nthe measures taken to defeat the avidity of the British government\r\ngrasping at our carrying business. I can add with truth, that it was\r\nnot till these symptoms appeared in America that I have been able to\r\ndiscover the smallest token of respect towards the United States in any\r\npart of Europe. There was an enthusiasm towards us all over Europe at\r\nthe moment of the peace. The torrent of lies published unremittingly\r\nin every day's London paper first made an impression and produced a\r\ncoolness. The republication of these lies in most of the papers of\r\nEurope, (done probably by authority of the governments to discourage\r\nemigrations,) carried them home to the belief of every mind. They\r\nsupposed everything in America was anarchy, tumult, and civil war. The\r\nreception of the Marquis Fayette gave a check to these ideas. The late\r\nproceedings seem to be producing a decisive vibration in our favor.\r\nI think it possible that England may ply before them. It is a nation\r\nwhich nothing but views of interest can govern. If they produce us good\r\nthere, they will here also. The defeat of the Irish propositions is\r\nalso in our favor.\r\n\r\nI have at length made up the purchase of books for you as far as it\r\ncan be done at present. The objects which I have not yet been able\r\nto get I shall continue to seek for. Those purchased are packed this\r\nmorning in two trunks, and you have the catalogue and prices herein\r\nenclosed. The future charges of transportation shall be carried into\r\nthe next bill. The amount of the present is 1154 livres 13 sous, which,\r\nreckoning the French crown of six livres at six shillings and eight\r\npence Virginia money, is £64, 3_s._, which sum you will be so good as\r\nto keep in your hands, to be used occasionally in the education of my\r\nnephews when the regular resources disappoint you. To the same use I\r\nwould pray you to apply twenty-five guineas which I have lent the two\r\nMr. Fitzhughs of Marmion, and which I have desired them to repay into\r\nyour hands. You will of course deduct the price of the revisals, and\r\nof any other articles you may have been so kind as to pay for me. Greek\r\nand Roman authors are dearer here than I believe anywhere in the world.\r\nNobody here reads them, wherefore they are not reprinted. Don Ulloa,\r\nin the original, is not to be found. The collection of tracts on the\r\neconomies of different nations we cannot find, nor Amelot's travels\r\ninto China. I shall send these two trunks of books to Havre, there to\r\nwait a conveyance to America; for as to the fixing the packets there,\r\nit is as uncertain as ever. The other articles you mention shall be\r\nprocured as far as they can be. Knowing that some of them would be\r\nbetter got in London, I commissioned Mr. Short, who was going there,\r\nto get them. He has not yet returned. They will be of such a nature as\r\nthat I can get some gentleman who may be going to America to take them\r\nin his portmanteau. Le Maire being now able to stand on his legs, there\r\nwill be no necessity for your advancing him the money I desired, if it\r\nis not already done. I am anxious to hear from you on the subject of\r\nmy Notes on Virginia. I have been obliged to give so many of them here\r\nthat I fear their getting published. I have received an application\r\nfrom the Directors of the public buildings, to procure them a plan for\r\ntheir capitol. I shall send them one taken from the best morsel of\r\nancient architecture now remaining. It has obtained the approbation\r\nof fifteen or sixteen centuries, and is therefore preferable to any\r\ndesign which might be newly contrived. It will give more room, be more\r\nconvenient, and cost less, than the plan they sent me. Pray encourage\r\nthem to wait for it, and to execute it. It will be superior in beauty\r\nto anything in America, and not inferior to anything in the world. It\r\nis very simple. Have you a copying press? If you have not, you should\r\nget one. Mine (exclusive of paper, which costs a guinea a ream) has\r\ncost me about fourteen guineas. I would give ten times that sum to have\r\nhad it from the date of the stamp act. I hope you will be so good as to\r\ncontinue your communications, both of the great and small kind, which\r\nare equally useful to me. Be assured of the sincerity with which I am,\r\ndear Sir,\r\n\r\n                        Your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. DUMAS AND SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                             _Paris_, September 1, 1785.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_,--I have been duly honored with the receipt of your\r\nseparate letters of August 23d, and should sooner have returned an\r\nanswer; but that as you had written also to Mr. Adams, I thought it\r\npossible I might receive his sentiments on the subject in time for the\r\npost. Not thinking it proper to lose the occasion of the post, I have\r\nconcluded to communicate to you my separate sentiments, which you will\r\nof course pay attention to only so far as they may concur with what you\r\nshall receive from Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\nOn a review of our letters to the Baron de Thulemeyer, I do not find\r\nthat we had proposed that the treaty should be in two columns, the\r\none English, and the other what he should think proper. We certainly\r\nintended to have proposed it. We had agreed together that it should be\r\nan article of system with us, and the omission of it in this instance\r\nhas been accidental. My own opinion, therefore, is, that to avoid\r\nthe appearance of urging new propositions when everything appeared\r\nto be arranged, we should agree to consider the French column as the\r\noriginal, if the Baron de Thulemeyer thinks himself bound to insist on\r\nit; but, if the practice of his court will admit of the execution in\r\nthe two languages, each to be considered as equally original, it would\r\nbe very pleasing to me, as it will accommodate it to our views, relieve\r\nus from the embarrassment of this precedent, which may be urged against\r\nus on other occasions, and be more agreeable to our country, where\r\nthe French language is spoken by very few. This method will also be\r\nattended with the advantage, that if any expression in any part of the\r\ntreaty is equivocal in the one language, its true sense will be known\r\nby the corresponding passage in the other.\r\n\r\nThe errors of the copyist in the French column you will correct of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very high esteem, Gentlemen, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, September 4, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--On receipt of your favors of August the 18th and 23d, I\r\nconferred with Mr. Barclay on the measures necessary to be taken,\r\nto set our treaty with the piratical States into motion, through his\r\nagency. Supposing that we should begin with the Emperor of Morocco,\r\na letter to the Emperor and instructions to Mr. Barclay, seemed\r\nnecessary. I have therefore sketched such outlines for these, as\r\nappear to me to be proper. You will be so good as to detract, add to,\r\nor alter them as you please, to return such as you approve under your\r\nsignature, to which I will add mine. A person understanding English,\r\nFrench, and Italian, and at the same time meriting confidence, was\r\nnot to be met with here. Colonel Franks, understanding the two first\r\nlanguages perfectly, and a little Spanish instead of Italian, occurred\r\nto Mr. Barclay as the fittest person he could employ for a secretary.\r\nWe think his allowance (exclusive of his travelling expenses and\r\nhis board, which will be paid by Mr. Barclay in common with his own)\r\nshould be between one hundred, and one hundred and fifty guineas a\r\nyear. Fix it where you please, between these limits. What is said in\r\nthe instructions to Mr. Barclay as to his own allowance, was proposed\r\nby himself. My idea as to the partition of the whole sum to which\r\nwe are limited (eighty thousand dollars), was, that one half of it\r\nshould be kept in reserve for the Algerines. They certainly possess\r\nmore than half of the whole power of the piratical States. I thought\r\nthen, that Morocco might claim the half of the remainder, that is to\r\nsay, one-fourth of the whole. For this reason, in the instructions,\r\nI propose twenty thousand dollars as the limit of the expenses of\r\nthe Morocco treaty. Be so good as to think of it, and make it what\r\nyou please. I should be more disposed to enlarge than abridge it, on\r\naccount of their neighborhood to our Atlantic trade. I did not think\r\nthat these papers should be trusted through the post office, and,\r\ntherefore, as Colonel Franks is engaged in the business, he comes\r\nwith them. Passing by the diligence, the whole expense will not exceed\r\ntwelve or fourteen guineas. I suppose we are bound to avail ourselves\r\nof the co-operation of France. I will join you, therefore, in any\r\nletter you think proper to write to the Count de Vergennes. Would\r\nyou think it expedient to write to Mr. Carmichael, to interest the\r\ninterposition of the Spanish court? I will join you in anything of this\r\nkind you will originate. In short, be so good as to supply whatever you\r\nmay think necessary. With respect to the money, Mr. Jay's information\r\nto you was, that it was to be drawn from Holland. It will rest,\r\ntherefore, with you, to avail Mr. Barclay of that fund, either by your\r\ndraft, or by a letter of credit to the bankers in his favor, to the\r\nnecessary amount. I imagine the Dutch consul at Morocco may be rendered\r\nan useful character, in the remittances of money to Mr. Barclay while\r\nat Morocco.\r\n\r\nYou were apprised, by a letter from Mr. Short, of the delay which had\r\narisen in the execution of the treaty with Prussia. I wrote a separate\r\nletter, of which I enclose you a copy, hoping it would meet one from\r\nyou, and set them again into motion.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[The following are the sketches of the letter to the Emperor of\r\nMorocco, and of the instructions to Mr. Barclay, referred to in the\r\npreceding letter.]\r\n\r\nHEADS FOR A LETTER TO THE EMPEROR OF MOROCCO.\r\n\r\nThat the United States of America, heretofore connected in government\r\nwith Great Britain, had found it necessary for their happiness to\r\nseparate from her, and to assume an independent station.\r\n\r\nThat, consisting of a number of separate States, they had confederated\r\ntogether, and placed the sovereignty of the whole, in matters relating\r\nto foreign nations, in a body consisting of delegates from every State,\r\nand called the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\nThat Great Britain had solemnly confirmed their separation, and\r\nacknowledged their independence.\r\n\r\nThat after the conclusion of the peace, which terminated the war\r\nin which they had been engaged for the establishment of their\r\nindependence, the first attentions of Congress were necessarily\r\nengrossed by the re-establishment of order and regular government.\r\n\r\nThat they had, as soon as possible, turned their attention to foreign\r\nnations, and, desirous of entering into amity and commerce with them,\r\nhad been pleased to appoint us with Dr. Benjamin Franklin, to execute\r\nsuch treaties for this purpose, as should be agreed on by such nations,\r\nwith us, or any two of us.\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Franklin having found it necessary to return to America, the\r\nexecution of these several commissions had devolved on us.\r\n\r\nThat being placed as Ministers Plenipotentiary for the United States\r\nat the courts of England and France; this circumstance, with the\r\ncommissions with which we are charged for entering into treaties with\r\nvarious other nations, puts it out of our power to attend at the other\r\ncourts in person, and obliges us to negotiate by the intervention of\r\nconfidential persons.\r\n\r\nThat, respecting the friendly dispositions shown by his Majesty, the\r\nEmperor of Morocco, towards the United States, and indulging the desire\r\nof forming a connection with a sovereign so renowned for his power, his\r\nwisdom, and his justice, we had embraced the first moment possible, of\r\nassuring him of these, the sentiments of our country and of ourselves,\r\nand of expressing to him our wishes to enter into a connection of\r\nfriendship and commerce with him.\r\n\r\nThat for this purpose, we had commissioned the bearer hereof, Thomas\r\nBarclay, a person in the highest confidence of the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, and as such, having been several years, and still being\r\ntheir consul general with our great and good friend and ally, the King\r\nof France, to arrange with his Majesty the Emperor those conditions\r\nwhich it might be advantageous for both nations to adopt, for the\r\nregulation of their commerce, and their mutual conduct towards each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThat we deliver to him a copy of the full powers with which we are\r\ninvested, to conclude a treaty with his Majesty, which copy he is\r\ninstructed to present to his Majesty.\r\n\r\nThat though by these, we are not authorized to delegate to him the\r\npower of ultimately signing the treaty, yet such is our reliance on his\r\nwisdom, his integrity, and his attention to the instructions with which\r\nhe is charged, that we assure his Majesty, the conditions which he\r\nshall arrange and send to us, shall be returned with our signature, in\r\norder to receive that of the person whom his Majesty shall commission\r\nfor the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHEADS OF INSTRUCTIONS TO MR. BARCLAY.\r\n\r\nCongress having been pleased to invest us with full powers for entering\r\ninto a treaty of amity and alliance with the Emperor of Morocco,\r\nand it being impracticable for us to attend his court in person, and\r\nequally impracticable, on account of our separate stations, to receive\r\na minister from him, we have concluded to effect our object by the\r\nintervention of a confidential person. We concur in wishing to avail\r\nthe United States of your talents in the execution of this business,\r\nand therefore furnish you with a letter to the Emperor of Morocco, to\r\ngive due credit to your transactions with him.\r\n\r\nWe advise you to proceed by the way of Madrid, where you will have\r\nopportunities of deriving many lights from Mr. Carmichael, through whom\r\nmany communications with the court of Morocco have already passed.\r\n\r\nFrom thence, you will proceed, by such route as you shall think best,\r\nto the court of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nYou will present to him our letter, with the copy of our full powers,\r\nwith which you are furnished, at such time or times, and in such\r\nmanner, as you shall find best.\r\n\r\nYou will proceed to negotiate, with his minister, the terms of a treaty\r\nof amity and commerce, as nearly conformed as possible to the draught\r\nwe give you. Where alterations, which, in your opinion, shall not be of\r\ngreat importance, shall be urged by the other party, you are at liberty\r\nto agree to them. Where they shall be of great importance, and such\r\nas you think should be rejected, you will reject them; but where they\r\nare of great importance, and you think they may be accepted, you will\r\nask time to take our advice, and will advise with us accordingly, by\r\nletter or by courier, as you shall think best. When the articles shall\r\nall be agreed, you will send them to us by some proper person, for our\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\nThe whole expense of this treaty, including as well the expenses of\r\nall persons employed about it, as the presents to the Emperor and\r\nhis servants must not exceed twenty thousand dollars; and we urge you\r\nto use your best endeavors to bring it as much below that sum as you\r\npossibly can. As custom may have rendered some presents necessary in\r\nthe beginning or progress of this business, and before it is concluded,\r\nor even in a way to be concluded, we authorize you to conform to the\r\ncustom, confiding in your discretion to hazard as little as possible,\r\nbefore a certainty of the event. We trust to you also to procure the\r\nbest information, as to what persons, and in what form, these presents\r\nshould be made, and to make them accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the customs of that and other courts, the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining a knowledge of those customs, but on the spot,\r\nand our great confidence in your discretion, induce us to leave to\r\nthat all other circumstances relative to the object of your mission.\r\nIt will be necessary for you to take a secretary, well skilled in\r\nthe French language, to aid you in your business, and to take charge\r\nof your papers in case of any accident to yourself. We think you may\r\nallow him ---- guineas a year, besides his expenses for travelling and\r\nsubsistence. We engage to furnish your own expenses, according to the\r\nrespectability of the character with which you are invested; but, as\r\nto the allowance for your trouble, we wish to leave it to Congress. We\r\nannex hereto sundry heads of inquiry which we wish you to make, and to\r\ngive us thereon the best information you shall be able to obtain. We\r\ndesire you to correspond with us by every opportunity which you think\r\nshould be trusted, giving us, from time to time, an account of your\r\nproceedings and prospects.\r\n\r\nHEADS OF INQUIRY FOR MR.

It was then put where I\r\nusually place my unanswered letters; and I, from time to time, put off\r\nacknowledging the receipt of it, till I should be able to furnish you\r\nAmerican intelligence worth communicating. A favorable opportunity, by\r\na courier, of writing to you, occurring this morning, what has been\r\nmy astonishment and chagrin, on reading your letter again, to find\r\nthere was a case in it which required an immediate answer, but which,\r\nby the variety of matters which happened to be presented to my mind,\r\nat the same time, had utterly escaped my recollection. I pray you to\r\nbe assured, that nothing but this slip of memory would have prevented\r\nmy immediate answer, and no other circumstance would have prevented\r\nits making such an impression on my mind, as that it could not have\r\nescaped. I hope you will, therefore, obliterate the imputation of\r\nwant of respect, which, under actual appearances, must have arisen in\r\nyour mind, but which would refer to an untrue cause the occasion of\r\nmy silence. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the proceedings of\r\nthe New York Assembly, to say, with certainty, in what predicament the\r\nlands of Mr. Upton may stand. But on conferring with Colonel Humphreys,\r\nwho, being from the neighboring State, was more in the way of knowing\r\nwhat passed in New York, he thinks that the descriptions in their\r\nconfiscation laws were such as not to include a case of this nature.\r\nThe first thing to be done by Mr. Upton, is, to state his case to some\r\nintelligent lawyer of the country, that he may know with certainty\r\nwhether they be confiscated or not; and if not confiscated, to know\r\nwhat measures are necessary for completing and securing his grant. But\r\nif confiscated, there is, then, no other tribunal of redress but their\r\nGeneral Assembly. If he is unacquainted there, I would advise him to\r\napply to Colonel Hamilton (who was aid to General Washington), and is\r\nnow very eminent at the bar, and much to be relied on. Your letter in\r\nhis favor to Mr. Jay will also procure him the benefit of his council.\r\n\r\nWith respect to America, I will rather give you a general view of\r\nits situation, than merely relate recent events. The impost is still\r\nunpassed by the two States of New York and Rhode Island; for the\r\nmanner in which the latter has passed it does not appear to me to\r\nanswer the principal object of establishing a fund, which, by being\r\nsubject to Congress alone, may give such credit to the certificates of\r\npublic debt, as will make them negotiable. This matter, then, is still\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nCongress have lately purchased the Indian right to nearly the whole of\r\nthe land lying in the new State, bounded by lake Erie, Pennsylvania,\r\nand the Ohio. The northwestern corner alone is reserved to the\r\nDelawares and Wiandots. I expect a purchase is also concluded with\r\nother tribes, for a considerable proportion of the State next to\r\nthis, on the north side of the Ohio. They have passed an ordinance\r\nestablishing a land office, considerably improved, I think, on the\r\nplan of which I had the honor of giving you a copy. The lands are to\r\nbe offered for sale to the highest bidder. For this purpose, portions\r\nof them are to be proposed in each State, that each may have the means\r\nof purchase carried equally to their doors, and that the purchasers\r\nmay be a proper mixture of the citizens from all the different States.\r\nBut such lots as cannot be sold for a dollar an acre, are not to be\r\nparted with. They will receive as money the certificates of public\r\ndebt. I flatter myself that this arrangement will very soon absorb\r\nthe whole of these certificates, and thus rid us of our domestic debt,\r\nwhich is four-fifths of our whole debt. Our foreign debt will then be\r\na bagatelle.\r\n\r\nI think it probable that Vermont will be made independent, as I am told\r\nthe State of New York is likely to agree to it. Maine will probably,\r\nin time, be also permitted to separate from Massachusetts. As yet,\r\nthey only begin to think of it. Whenever the people of Kentucky shall\r\nhave agreed among themselves, my friends write me word, that Virginia\r\nwill consent to their separation. They will constitute the new State\r\non the south side of Ohio, joining Virginia. North Carolina, by an\r\nact of their Assembly, ceded to Congress all their lands westward of\r\nthe Alleghany. The people inhabiting that territory, thereon declared\r\nthemselves independent, called their State by the name of Franklin, and\r\nsolicited Congress to be received into the Union. But before Congress\r\nmet, North Carolina (for what reasons I could never learn) resumed\r\ntheir cession. The people, however, persist; Congress recommended to\r\nthe State to desist from their opposition, and I have no doubt they\r\nwill do it. It will, therefore, result from the act of Congress laying\r\noff the western country into new States, that these States will come\r\ninto the Union in the manner therein provided, and without any disputes\r\nas to their boundaries.\r\n\r\nI am told that some hostile transaction by our people at the Natchez,\r\nagainst the Spaniards, has taken place. If it be fact, Congress will\r\ncertainly not protect them, but leave them to be chastised by the\r\nSpaniards, saving the right to the territory. A Spanish minister being\r\nnow with Congress, and both parties interested in keeping the peace, I\r\nthink, if such an event has happened, it will be easily arranged.\r\n\r\nI told you, when here, of the propositions made by Congress to the\r\nStates, to be authorized to make certain regulations in their commerce;\r\nand that, from the disposition to strengthen the hands of Congress,\r\nwhich was then growing fast, I thought they would consent to it. Most\r\nof them did so, and I suppose all of them would have done it, if they\r\nhave not actually done it, but that events proved a much more extensive\r\npower would be requisite. Congress have, therefore, desired to be\r\ninvested with the whole regulation of their trade, and forever; and to\r\nprevent all temptations to abuse the power, and all fears of it, they\r\npropose that whatever moneys shall be levied on commerce, either for\r\nthe purpose of revenue, or by way of forfeitures or penalty, shall go\r\ndirectly into the coffers of the State wherein it is levied, without\r\nbeing touched by Congress. From the present temper of the States, and\r\nthe conviction which your country has carried home to their minds,\r\nthat there is no other method of defeating the greedy attempts of other\r\ncountries to trade with them on equal terms, I think they will add an\r\narticle for this purpose to their Confederation. But the present powers\r\nof Congress over the commerce of the States, under the Confederation,\r\nseem not at all understood by your ministry. They say that body has\r\nno power to enter into a treaty of commerce; why then make one? This\r\nis a mistake. By the sixth article of the Confederation, the States\r\nrenounce, individually, all power to make any treaty, of whatever\r\nnature, with a foreign nation. By the ninth article, they give the\r\npower of making treaties wholly to Congress, with two reservations\r\nonly. 1. That no treaty of commerce shall be made, which shall restrain\r\nthe legislature from making foreigners pay the same imposts with their\r\nown people: nor 2d, from prohibiting the exportation or importation\r\nof any species of merchandise, which they might think proper. Were\r\nany treaty to be made which should violate either of these two\r\nreservations, it would be so far void. In the treaties, therefore, made\r\nwith France, Holland, &c., this has been cautiously avoided. But are\r\nthese treaties of no advantage to these nations? Besides the advantages\r\nexpressly given by them, there results another, of great value. The\r\ncommerce of those nations with the United States, is thereby under the\r\nprotection of Congress, and no particular State, acting by fits and\r\nstarts, can harass the trade of France, Holland, &c., by such measures\r\nas several of them have practiced against England, by loading her\r\nmerchandise with partial impost, refusing admittance to it altogether,\r\nexcluding her merchants, &c., &c. For you will observe, that though\r\nby the second reservation before mentioned, they can prohibit the\r\nimportation of any _species_ of merchandise, as for instance, though\r\nthey may prohibit the importation of wines in general, yet they cannot\r\nprohibit that of _French_ wines in particular. Another advantage is,\r\nthat the nations having treaties with Congress, can and do provide in\r\nsuch treaties for the admission of their consuls, a kind of officer\r\nvery necessary for the regulation and protection of commerce. You\r\nknow that a consul is the creature of treaty. No nation without an\r\nagreement, can place an officer in another country, with any powers or\r\njurisdiction whatever. But as the States have renounced the separate\r\npower of making treaties with foreign nations, they cannot separately\r\nreceive a consul; and as Congress have, by the Confederation, no\r\nimmediate jurisdiction over commerce, as they have only a power of\r\nbringing that jurisdiction into existence by entering into a treaty,\r\ntill such treaty be entered into, Congress themselves cannot receive\r\na consul. Till a treaty then, there exists no power in any part of our\r\ngovernment, federal or particular, to admit a consul among us; and if\r\nit be true, as the papers say, that you have lately sent one over, he\r\ncannot be admitted by any power in existence, to an exercise of any\r\nfunction. Nothing less than a new article, to be agreed to by all the\r\nStates, would enable Congress, or the particular States, to receive\r\nhim. You must not be surprised then, if he be not received.\r\n\r\nI think I have by this time tired you with American politics, and\r\nwill therefore only add assurances of the sincere regard and esteem,\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BARON GEISMER.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, September 6, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of March the 28th, which I received about a\r\nmonth after its date, gave me a very real pleasure, as it assured\r\nme of an existence which I valued, and of which I had been led to\r\ndoubt. You are now too distant from America, to be much interested in\r\nwhat passes there. From the London gazettes, and the papers copying\r\nthem, you are led to suppose that all there is anarchy, discontent\r\nand civil war. Nothing, however, is less true. There are not, on the\r\nface of the earth, more tranquil governments than ours, nor a happier\r\nand more contented people. Their commerce has not as yet found the\r\nchannels, which their new relations with the world will offer to best\r\nadvantage, and the old ones remain as yet unopened by new conventions.\r\nThis occasions a stagnation in the sale of their produce, the only\r\ntruth among all the circumstances published about them. Their hatred\r\nagainst Great Britain, having lately received from that nation new\r\ncause and new aliment, has taken a new spring. Among the individuals\r\nof your acquaintance, nothing remarkable has happened. No revolution\r\nin the happiness of any of them has taken place, except that of the\r\nloss of their only child to Mr. and Mrs. Walker, who, however, left\r\nthem a grand-child for their solace, and that of your humble servant,\r\nwho remains with no other family than two daughters, the elder here\r\n(who was of your acquaintance), the younger in Virginia, but expected\r\nhere the next summer. The character in which I am here at present,\r\nconfines me to this place, and will confine me as long as I continue in\r\nEurope. How long this will be, I cannot tell. I am now of an age which\r\ndoes not easily accommodate itself to new manners and new modes of\r\nliving; and I am savage enough to prefer the woods, the wilds, and the\r\nindependence of Monticello, to all the brilliant pleasures of this gay\r\nCapital. I shall, therefore, rejoin myself to my native country, with\r\nnew attachments, and with exaggerated esteem for its advantages; for\r\nthough there is less wealth there, there is more freedom, more ease,\r\nand less misery. I should like it better, however, if it could tempt\r\nyou once more to visit it: but that is not to be expected. Be this as\r\nit may, and whether fortune means to allow or deny me the pleasure of\r\never seeing you again, be assured that the worth which gave birth to my\r\nattachment, and which still animates it, will continue to keep it up\r\nwhile we both live, and that it is with sincerity I subscribe myself,\r\ndear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN LANGDON.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, September 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your Captain Yeaton being here, furnishes me an opportunity\r\nof paying the tribute of my congratulations on your appointment to\r\nthe government of your State, which I do sincerely. He gives me the\r\ngrateful intelligence of your health, and that of Mrs. Langdon. Anxious\r\nto promote your service, and believing he could do it by getting\r\nhimself naturalized here, and authorized to command your vessel, he\r\ncame from Havre to Paris. But on making the best inquiries I could, it\r\nseemed that the time requisite to go through with this business, would\r\nbe much more than he could spare. He therefore declined it. I wish\r\nit were in my power to give you a hope that our commerce, either with\r\nthis country, or its islands, was likely to be put on a better footing.\r\nBut if it be altered at all, it will probably be for the worse. The\r\nregulations respecting their commerce are by no means sufficiently\r\nstable to be relied on.\r\n\r\nEurope is in quiet, and likely to remain so. The affairs of the Emperor\r\nand Dutch are as good as settled, and no other cloud portends any\r\nimmediate storm. You have heard much of American vessels taken by the\r\nBarbary pirates. The Emperor of Morocco took one last winter, (the\r\nbrig Betsey from Philadelphia;) he did not however reduce the crew to\r\nslavery, nor confiscate the vessel or cargo. He has lately delivered\r\nup the crew on the solicitation of the Spanish court. No other has\r\never been taken by them. There are, indeed, rumors of one having\r\nbeen lately taken by the Algerines. The fact is possible, as there is\r\nnothing to hinder their taking them, but it is not as yet confirmed.\r\nI have little doubt, that we shall be able to place our commerce on\r\na popular footing with the Barbary States, this summer, and thus not\r\nonly render our navigation to Portugal and Spain safe, but open the\r\nMediterranean as formerly. In spite of treaties, England is still our\r\nenemy. Her hatred is deep rooted and cordial, and nothing is wanting\r\nwith her but the power, to wipe us and the land we live on out of\r\nexistence. Her interest, however, is her ruling passion; and the late\r\nAmerican measures have struck at that so vitally, and with an energy,\r\ntoo, of which she had thought us quite incapable, that a possibility\r\nseems to open of forming some arrangement with her. When they shall\r\nsee decidedly, that, without it, we shall suppress their commerce with\r\nus, they will be agitated by their avarice, on the one hand, and their\r\nhatred and their fear of us, on the other. The result of this conflict\r\nof dirty passions is yet to be awaited. The body of the people of this\r\ncountry love us cordially. But ministers and merchants love nobody. The\r\nmerchants here, are endeavoring to exclude us from their islands. The\r\nministers will be governed in it by political motives, and will do it,\r\nor not do it, as these shall appear to dictate, without love or hatred\r\nto anybody. It were to be wished that they were able to combine better,\r\nthe various circumstances which prove, beyond a doubt, that all the\r\nadvantages of their colonies result, in the end, to the mother country.\r\nI pray you to present me in the most friendly terms to Mrs. Langdon,\r\nand to be assured of the esteem with which I am, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE LA VALEE.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, September 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received duly your favor of August 14th. It is not in my power\r\nto take on the account of Congress any part of the expenses of your\r\npassage, having received no authority of that kind from them; nor\r\nindeed is the encouragement of emigrations among the objects with which\r\nthey are charged. I fear that when you get to Portsmouth you will find\r\ndifficulties in the winter season to go by water to any more southern\r\nStates. Your objects being the manufacture of wool and cotton, you will\r\nof course choose to fix yourself where you can get both or one of these\r\narticles in plenty. The most and best wool is to be had in the middle\r\nStates; they begin to make a little cotton in Maryland; they make a\r\ngreat deal in Virginia, and all the States south of that. The price\r\nof clean cotton in Virginia is from 21 to 26 sols. a pound, that is to\r\nsay, from a fifth to a fourth of a dollar. General Washington being at\r\nthe head of the great works carrying on towards clearing the Potomac,\r\nI have no doubt but that work will be completed. It will furnish great\r\nopportunities of using machines of all kinds; perhaps you may find\r\nemployment there for your skill in that way. Alexandria on the Potomac\r\nwill undoubtedly become a very great place, but Norfolk would be the\r\nbest for cotton manufacture. As you are a stranger, I mention such\r\nfacts as I suppose may be useful to you. I wish you success, and am,\r\nSir, your very humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LE MARG. DE PONCENS.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, September 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received three days ago the letter you did me the honor\r\nto write to me on the 2d of August. Congress have purchased a very\r\nconsiderable extent of country from the Indians, and have passed an\r\nordinance laying down rules for disposing of it. These admit only two\r\nconsiderations for granting lands; first, military service rendered\r\nduring the late war; and secondly, money to be paid at the time of\r\ngranting, for the purpose of discharging their national debt. They\r\ndirect these lands to be sold at auction to him who will give most\r\nfor them, but that, at any rate, they shall not be sold for less than\r\na dollar an acre. However, as they receive as money the certificates\r\nof public debt, and these can be bought for the half or fourth of\r\ntheir nominal value, the price of the lands is reduced in proportion.\r\nAs Congress exercise their government by general rules only, I do\r\nnot believe they will grant lands to any individual for any other\r\nconsideration than those mentioned in their ordinance. They have\r\nordered the lands to be surveyed, and this work is now actually going\r\non under the directions of their own geographer. They do not require\r\ninformation of the quality of the soil, because they will sell the\r\nlands faster than this could be obtained; and after they are sold,\r\nit is the interest of the purchaser to examine for what the soil is\r\nproper. As ours is a country of husbandmen, I make no doubt they will\r\nreceive the book of which you write to me with pleasure and advantage.\r\nI have stated to you such facts as might enable you to decide for\r\nyourself how far that country presents advantages which might answer\r\nyour views. It is proper for me to add that everything relative to\r\nthe sale and survey of these lands is out of the province of my duty.\r\nSupposing you might be desirous of receiving again the letters of Dr.\r\nFranklin, I enclose them, and have the honor to be, with the greatest\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, September 20, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--By Mr. Fitzhugh, you will receive my letter of the first\r\ninstant. He is still here, and gives me an opportunity of again\r\naddressing you much sooner than I should have done, but for the\r\ndiscovery of a great piece of inattention. In that letter I send you a\r\ndetail of the cost of your books, and desire you to keep the amount in\r\nyour hands, as if I had forgot that a part of it was in fact your own,\r\nas being a balance of what I had remained in your debt. I really did\r\nnot attend to it in the moment of writing, and when it occurred to me,\r\nI revised my memorandum book from the time of our being in Philadelphia\r\ntogether, and stated our account from the beginning, lest I should\r\nforget or mistake any part of it. I enclose you this statement. You\r\nwill always be so good as to let me know, from time to time, your\r\nadvances for me. Correct with freedom all my proceedings for you, as,\r\nin what I do, I have no other desire than that of doing exactly what\r\nwill be most pleasing to you.\r\n\r\nI received this summer a letter from Messrs. Buchanan and Hay,\r\nas Directors of the public buildings, desiring I would have drawn\r\nfor them, plans of sundry buildings, and, in the first place, of\r\na capitol. They fixed, for their receiving this plan, a day which\r\nwas within about six weeks of that on which their letter came to my\r\nhand. I engaged an architect of capital abilities in this business.\r\nMuch time was requisite, after the external form was agreed on, to\r\nmake the internal distribution convenient for the three branches of\r\ngovernment. This time was much lengthened by my avocations to other\r\nobjects, which I had no right to neglect. The plan, however, was\r\nsettled. The gentlemen had sent me one which they had thought of. The\r\none agreed on here, is more convenient, more beautiful, gives more\r\nroom, and will not cost more than two-thirds of what that would. We\r\ntook for our model what is called the Maison quarrée of Nismes, one of\r\nthe most beautiful, if not the most beautiful and precious morsel of\r\narchitecture left us by antiquity. It was built by Caius and Lucius\r\nCæsar, and repaired by Louis XIV., and has the suffrage of all the\r\njudges of architecture who have seen it, as yielding to no one of\r\nthe beautiful monuments of Greece, Rome, Palmyra, and Balbec, which\r\nlate travellers have communicated to us. It is very simple, but it is\r\nnoble beyond expression, and would have done honor to our country, as\r\npresenting to travellers a specimen of taste in our infancy, promising\r\nmuch for our maturer age. I have been much mortified with information,\r\nwhich I received two days ago from Virginia, that the first brick of\r\nthe capitol would be laid within a few days. But surely, the delay\r\nof this piece of a summer would have been repaired by the savings in\r\nthe plan preparing here, were we to value its other superiorities as\r\nnothing. But how is a taste in this beautiful art to be formed in our\r\ncountrymen unless we avail ourselves of every occasion when public\r\nbuildings are to be erected, of presenting to them models for their\r\nstudy and imitation? Pray try if you can effect the stopping of this\r\nwork. I have written also to E. R. on the subject. The loss will be\r\nonly of the laying the bricks already laid, or a part of them. The\r\nbricks themselves will do again for the interior walls, and one side\r\nwall and one end wall may remain, as they will answer equally well for\r\nour plan. This loss is not to be weighed against the saving of money\r\nwhich will arise, against the comfort of laying out the public money\r\nfor something honorable, the satisfaction of seeing an object and proof\r\nof national good taste, and the regret and mortification of erecting\r\na monument of our barbarism, which will be loaded with execrations as\r\nlong as it shall endure. The plans are in good forwardness, and I hope\r\nwill be ready within three or four weeks. They could not be stopped\r\nnow, but on paying their whole price, which will be considerable. If\r\nthe undertakers are afraid to undo what they have done, encourage them\r\nto it by a recommendation from the Assembly. You see I am an enthusiast\r\non the subject of the arts. But it is an enthusiasm of which I am not\r\nashamed, as its object is to improve the taste of my countrymen, to\r\nincrease their reputation, to reconcile to them the respect of the\r\nworld, and procure them its praise.\r\n\r\nI shall send off your books, in two trunks, to Havre, within two or\r\nthree days, to the care of Mr. Limozin, American agent there. I will\r\nadvise you, as soon as I know by what vessel he forwards them. Adieu.\r\nYours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDMUND RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, September 20, 1785,\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Being in your debt for ten volumes of Buffon, I have\r\nendeavored to find something that would be agreeable to you to receive,\r\nin return. I therefore send you, by way of Havre, a dictionary of\r\nlaw, natural and municipal, in thirteen volumes 4to, called le Code\r\nde l'humanité. It is published by Felice, but written by him and\r\nseveral other authors of established reputation. Is is an excellent\r\nwork. I do not mean to say, that it answers fully to its title. That\r\nwould have required fifty times the volume. It wants many articles\r\nwhich the title would induce us to seek in it. But the articles\r\nwhich it contains are well written. It is better than the voluminous\r\nDictionnaire diplomatique, and better, also, than the same branch of\r\nthe Encyclopedie methodique. There has been nothing published here,\r\nsince I came, of extraordinary merit. The Encyclopedie methodique,\r\nwhich is coming out, from time to time, must be excepted from this.\r\nIt is to be had at two guineas less than the subscription price. I\r\nshall be happy to send you anything in this way which you may desire.\r\nFrench books are to be bought here, for two-thirds of what they can in\r\nEngland. English and Greek and Latin authors, cost from twenty-five to\r\nfifty per cent. more here than in England.\r\n\r\nI received, some time ago, a letter from Messrs. Hay and Buchanan, as\r\nDirectors of the public buildings, desiring I would have plans drawn\r\nfor our public buildings, and in the first place, for the capitol. I\r\ndid not receive their letter until within six weeks of the time they\r\nhad fixed on, for receiving the drawings. Nevertheless, I engaged an\r\nexcellent architect to comply with their desire. It has taken much\r\ntime to accommodate the external adopted, to the internal arrangement\r\nnecessary for the three branches of government. However, it is effected\r\non a plan, which, with a great deal of beauty and convenience within,\r\nunites an external form on the most perfect model of antiquity now\r\nexisting. This is the Maison quarrée of Nismes, built by Caius and\r\nLucius Cæsar, and repaired by Louis XIV., which, in the opinion of\r\nall who have seen it, yields in beauty to no piece of architecture on\r\nearth. The gentlemen enclosed me a plan of which they had thought. The\r\none preparing here, will be more convenient, give more room, and cost\r\nbut two-thirds of that; and as a piece of architecture, doing honor to\r\nour country, will leave nothing to be desired. The plans will be ready\r\nsoon. But, two days ago, I received a letter from Virginia, informing\r\nme the first brick of the capitol would be laid in a few days. This\r\nmortifies me extremely. The delay of this summer, would have been amply\r\nrepaid by the superiority and economy of the plan preparing here. Is\r\nit impossible to stop the work where it is? You will gain money by\r\nlosing what is done, and general approbation, instead of occasioning\r\na regret, which will endure as long as your building does. How is\r\na taste for a chaste and good style of building to be formed in our\r\ncountrymen, unless we seize all occasions which the erection of public\r\nbuildings offers, of presenting to them models for their imitation? Do,\r\nmy dear Sir, exert your influence to stay the further progress of the\r\nwork, till you can receive these plans. You will only lose the price\r\nof laying what bricks are already laid, and of taking part of them\r\nasunder. They will do again for the inner walls. A plan for a prison\r\nwill be sent at the same time.\r\n\r\nMazzei is here, and in pressing distress for money. I have helped him\r\nas far as I have been able, but particular circumstances put it out of\r\nmy power to do more. He is looking with anxiety to the arrival of every\r\nvessel, in hopes of relief through your means. If he does not receive\r\nit soon, it is difficult to foresee his fate.\r\n\r\nThe quiet which Europe enjoys at present leaves nothing to communicate\r\nto you in the political way. The Emperor and Dutch still differ about\r\nthe quantum of money to be paid by the latter; they know not what.\r\nPerhaps their internal convulsions will hasten them to a decision.\r\nFrance is improving her navy, as if she were already in a naval war,\r\nyet I see no immediate prospect of her having occasion for it. England\r\nis not likely to offer war to any nation, unless perhaps to ours. This\r\nwould cost us our whole shipping, but in every other respect we might\r\nflatter ourselves with success. But the most successful war seldom pays\r\nfor its losses. I shall be glad to hear from you when convenient, and\r\nam, with much esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, September 24, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received your favor of the 18th, enclosing\r\nyour compliments on your presentation. The sentiments you therein\r\nexpressed were such as were entertained in America till the commercial\r\nproclamation, and such as would again return were a rational conduct\r\nto be adopted by Great Britain. I think, therefore, you by no means\r\ncompromised yourself or our country, nor expressed more than it would\r\nbe our interest to encourage, if they were disposed to meet us. I am\r\npleased, however, to see the answer of the King. It bears the marks\r\nof suddenness and surprise, and as he seems not to have had time for\r\nreflection, we may suppose he was obliged to find his answer in the\r\nreal sentiments of his heart, if that heart has any sentiment. I have\r\nno doubt, however, that it contains the real creed of an Englishman,\r\nand that the word which he has let escape, is the true word of the\r\nenigma. \"The moment I see such sentiments as yours prevail, and a\r\ndisposition to give this country the _preference_, I will, &c.\" All\r\nthis I steadily believe. But the condition is impossible. Our interest\r\ncalls for a perfect equality in our conduct towards these two nations;\r\nbut no preference anywhere. If, however, circumstances should ever\r\noblige us to show a preference, a respect for our character, if we had\r\nno better motive, would decide to which it should be given.\r\n\r\nMy letters from members of Congress render it doubtful whether they\r\nwould not rather that full time should be given for the present\r\ndisposition of America to mature itself, and to produce a permanent\r\nimprovement in the federal constitution, rather than by removing the\r\nincentive to prevent the improvement. It is certain that our commerce\r\nis in agonies at present, and that these would be relieved by opening\r\nthe British ports in the West Indies. It remains to consider whether a\r\ntemporary continuance under these sufferings would be paid for by the\r\namendment it is likely to produce. However, I believe there is no fear\r\nthat Great Britain will puzzle us by leaving it in our choice to hasten\r\nor delay a treaty.\r\n\r\nIs insurance made on Houdon's life? I am uneasy about it, lest we\r\nshould hear of any accident. As yet there is no reason to doubt their\r\nsafe passage. If the insurance is not made, I will pray you to have it\r\ndone immediately.\r\n\r\nAs I have not received any London newspapers as yet, I am obliged to\r\nask you what is done as to them, lest the delay should proceed from\r\nsome obstacle to be removed.\r\n\r\nThere is a Mr. Thompson at Dover, who has proposed to me a method of\r\ngetting them post free, but I have declined resorting to it till I\r\nshould know in what train the matter is at present.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, September 24, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My letter of September the 19th, written the morning after\r\nMr. Lambe's arrival here, will inform you of that circumstance. I\r\ntransmit you herewith copies of the papers he brought to us on the\r\nsubject of the Barbary treaties. You will see by them that Congress\r\nhave adopted the very plan which we were proposing to pursue. It will\r\nnow go on with less danger of objection from the other parties. The\r\nreceipt of these new papers, therefore, has rendered necessary no\r\nchange, in matter of substance, in the despatches we had prepared. But\r\nthey render some formal changes necessary. For instance, in our letter\r\nof credence for Mr. Barclay to the Emperor of Morocco, it becomes\r\nimproper to enter into those explanations which seemed proper when that\r\nletter was drawn, because Congress, in their letter, enter into those\r\nexplanations. In the letter to the Count de Vergennes, it became proper\r\nto mention the new full powers received from Congress, and which,\r\nin some measure, accord with the idea communicated by him to us from\r\nthe Marechal de Castries. These and other formal alterations, which\r\nappeared necessary to me, I have made, leaving so much of the original\r\ndraughts, approved and amended by you, as were not inconsistent with\r\nthese alterations. I have, therefore, had these prepared fair, to\r\nsave you the trouble of copying; yet, wherever you choose to make\r\nalterations, you will be so good as to make them, taking, in that case,\r\nthe trouble of having new fair copies made out.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by Mr. Jay's letter that Congress had not thought\r\nproper to give Mr. Lambe any appointment. I imagine they apprehend it\r\nmight interfere with measures actually taken by us. Notwithstanding\r\nthe perfect freedom which they are pleased to leave to us on this\r\nsubject, I cannot feel myself clear of that bias which a presumption\r\nof their pleasure gives, and ought to give. I presume that Mr. Lambe\r\nmet their approbation, because of the recommendations he carried from\r\nthe Governor and State of Connecticut, because of his actual knowledge\r\nof the country and people of the States of Barbary, because of the\r\ndetention of these letters from March to July, which, considering their\r\npressing nature, would otherwise have been sent by other Americans,\r\nwho, in the meantime, have come from New York to Paris, and because,\r\ntoo, of the information we received by Mr. Jarvis. These reasons\r\nare not strong enough to set aside our appointment of Mr. Barclay to\r\nMorocco; that I think should go on, as no man could be sent who would\r\nenjoy more the confidence of Congress. But they are strong enough to\r\ninduce me to propose to you the appointment of Lambe to Algiers. He\r\nhas followed for many years the Barbary trade, and seems intimately\r\nacquainted with those States. I have not seen enough of him to judge\r\nof his abilities. He seems not deficient, as far as I can see, and\r\nthe footing on which he comes, must furnish a presumption for what\r\nwe do not see. We must say the same as to his integrity; we must rely\r\nfor this on the recommendations he brings, as it is impossible for us\r\nto judge of this for ourselves. Yet it will be our duty to use such\r\nreasonable cautions as are in our power. Two occur to me. 1. To give\r\nhim a clerk capable of assisting and attending to his proceedings,\r\nand who, in case he thought anything was going amiss, might give us\r\ninformation. 2. Not to give him a credit on Van Staphorst and Willinck,\r\nbut let his drafts be made on yourself, which, with the knowledge you\r\nwill have of his proceedings, will enable you to check them, if you\r\nare sensible of any abuse intended. This will give you trouble; but\r\nas I have never found you declining trouble when it is necessary, I\r\nventure to propose it. I hope it will not expose you to inconvenience,\r\nas by instructing Lambe to insert in his drafts a proper usance, you\r\ncan, in the meantime, raise the money for them by drawing on Holland. I\r\nmust inform you that Mr. Barclay wishes to be put on the same footing\r\nwith Mr. Lambe, as to this article, and therefore I return you your\r\nletter of credit on Van Staphorst & Co. As to the first article, there\r\nis great difficulty. There is nobody at Paris fit for the undertaking\r\nwho would be likely to accept it. I mean there is no American, for I\r\nshould be anxious to place a native in the trust. Perhaps you can send\r\nus one from London. There is a Mr. Randall there from New York, whom\r\nMr. Barclay thinks might be relied on very firmly for integrity and\r\ncapacity. He is there for his health; perhaps you can persuade him\r\nto go to Algiers in pursuit of it. If you cannot, I really know not\r\nwhat will be done. It is impossible to propose to Bancroft to go in a\r\nsecondary capacity. Mr. Barclay and myself have thought of Cairnes,\r\nat L'Orient, as a dernier resort. But it is uncertain, or rather\r\nimprobable, that he will undertake it. You will be pleased, in the\r\nfirst place, to consider of my proposition to send Lambe to Algiers;\r\nand in the next, all the circumstances before detailed, as consequences\r\nof that.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter from Richard O'Bryan furnishes powerful motives\r\nfor commencing, by some means or other, the treaty with Algiers,\r\nmore immediately than would be done if left on Mr. Barclay. You\r\nwill perceive by that, that two of our vessels, with their crews\r\nand cargoes, have been carried captive into that port. What is to be\r\ndone as to those poor people? I am for hazarding the supplementary\r\ninstruction to Lambe which accompanies these papers. Alter it, or\r\nreject it, as you please. You ask what I think of claiming the Dutch\r\ninterposition. I doubt the fidelity of any interposition too much to\r\ndesire it sincerely. Our letters to this court heretofore seemed to\r\noblige us to communicate with them on the subject. If you think the\r\nDutch would take amiss our not applying to them, I will join you in the\r\napplication. Otherwise, the fewer who are apprised of our proceedings,\r\nthe better. To communicate them to the States of Holland, is to\r\ncommunicate them to the whole world.\r\n\r\nMr. Short returned last night, and brought the Prussian treaty, duly\r\nexecuted in English and French. We may send it to Congress by the Mr.\r\nFitzhughs, going from hence. Will you draw and sign a short letter for\r\nthat purpose? I send you a copy of a letter received from the Marquis\r\nFayette. In the present unsettled state of American commerce, I had as\r\nleave avoid all further treaties, except with American powers. If Count\r\nMerci, therefore, does not propose the subject to me, I shall not to\r\nhim, nor do more than decency requires, if he does propose it.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO F. HOPKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, September 25, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of the 6th of July. Since that, I have\r\nreceived yours of July the 23d. I do not altogether despair of making\r\nsomething of your method of quilling, though, as yet, the prospect\r\nis not favorable. I applaud much your perseverance in improving this\r\ninstrument, and benefiting mankind almost in spite of their teeth.\r\nI mentioned to Piccini the improvement with which I am entrusted. He\r\nplays on the pianoforte, and therefore did not feel himself personally\r\ninterested. I hope some better opportunity will yet fall in my way\r\nof doing it justice. I had almost decided, on his advice, to get a\r\npianoforte for my daughter; but your last letter may pause me, till I\r\nsee its effect.\r\n\r\nArts and arms are alike asleep for the moment. Ballooning indeed goes\r\non. There are two artists in the neighborhood of Paris, who seem to\r\nbe advancing towards the desideratum in this business. They are able\r\nto rise and fall at will, without expending their gas, and to deflect\r\nforty-five degrees from the course of the wind.\r\n\r\nI desired you, in my last, to send the newspapers, notwithstanding the\r\nexpense. I had then no idea of it. Some late instances have made me\r\nperfectly acquainted with it. I have therefore been obliged to adopt\r\nthe following plan. To have my newspapers, from the different States,\r\nenclosed to the office for Foreign Affairs, and to desire Mr. Jay to\r\npack the whole in a box, and send it by the packet as merchandise,\r\ndirected to the American consul at L' Orient, who will forward it\r\nto me by the periodical wagons. In this way, they will only cost me\r\nlivres where they now cost me guineas. I must pray you, just before\r\nthe departure of every French packet, to send my papers on hand, to\r\nMr. Jay, in this way. I do not know whether I am subject to American\r\npostage or not, in general; but I think newspapers never are. I have\r\nsometimes thought of sending a copy of my Notes to the Philosophical\r\nSociety, as a tribute due to them; but this would seem as if I\r\nconsidered them as worth something, which I am conscious they are not.\r\nI will not ask you for your advice on this occasion, because it is\r\none of those on which no man is authorized to ask a sincere opinion. I\r\nshall therefore refer it to further thoughts.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO R. IZARD.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, September 26, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received, a few days ago, your favor of the 10th of June,\r\nand am to thank you for the trouble you have given yourself, to procure\r\nme information on the subject of the commerce of your State. I pray\r\nyou also, to take the trouble of expressing my acknowledgments to the\r\nGovernor and Chamber of Commerce, as well as to Mr. Hall, for the very\r\nprecise details on this subject, with which they have been pleased to\r\nhonor me. Your letter of last January, of which you make mention, never\r\ncame to my hands. Of course, the papers now received are the first and\r\nonly ones which have come safe. The infidelities of the post offices,\r\nboth of England and France, are not unknown to you. The former are\r\nthe most rascally, because they retain one's letters, not choosing\r\nto take the trouble of copying them. The latter, when they have taken\r\ncopies, are so civil as to send the originals, resealed clumsily with a\r\ncomposition, on which they have previously taken the impression of the\r\nseal. England shows no dispositions to enter into friendly connections\r\nwith us. On the contrary, her detention of our posts, seems to be the\r\nspeck which is to produce a storm. I judge that a war with America\r\nwould be a popular war in England. Perhaps the situation of Ireland\r\nmay deter the ministry from hastening it on. Peace is at length made\r\nbetween the Emperor and Dutch. The terms are not published, but it is\r\nsaid, he gets ten millions of florins, the navigation of the Scheldt\r\nnot quite to Antwerp, and two forts. However, this is not to be\r\nabsolutely relied on. The league formed by the King of Prussia against\r\nthe Emperor, is a most formidable obstacle to his ambitious designs. It\r\ncertainly has defeated his views on Bavaria, and will render doubtful\r\nthe election of his nephew to be King of the Romans. Matters are not\r\nyet settled between him and the Turk. In truth, he undertakes too much.\r\nAt home he has made some good regulations.\r\n\r\nYour present pursuit being (the wisest of all) agriculture, I am not in\r\na situation to be useful to it. You know that France is not the country\r\nmost celebrated for this art. I went the other day to see a plough\r\nwhich was to be worked by a windlass, without horses or oxen. It was\r\na poor affair. With a very troublesome apparatus, applicable only to\r\na dead level, four men could do the work of two horses. There seems a\r\npossibility that the great desideratum in the use of the balloon may be\r\nobtained. There are two persons at Javel (opposite to Auteuil) who are\r\npushing this matter. They are able to rise and fall at will, without\r\nexpending their gas, and they can deflect forty-five degrees from the\r\ncourse of the wind.\r\n\r\nI took the liberty of asking you to order me a Charleston newspaper.\r\nThe expense of French postage is so enormous, that I have been obliged\r\nto desire that my newspapers, from the different States, may be sent to\r\nthe office for Foreign Affairs at New York; and I have requested of Mr.\r\nJay to have them always packed in a box, and sent by the French packets\r\nas merchandise, to the care of the American consul at L'Orient, who\r\nwill send them on by the periodical wagons. Will you permit me to add\r\nthis to the trouble I have before given you, of ordering the printer\r\nto send them, under cover to Mr. Jay, by such opportunities by water,\r\nas occur from time to time. This request must go to the acts of your\r\nAssembly also. I shall be on the watch to send you anything that may\r\nappear here on the subjects of agriculture or the arts, which may be\r\nworth your perusal. I sincerely congratulate Mrs. Izard and yourself,\r\non the double accession to your family by marriage and a new birth.\r\nMy daughter values much your remembrance of her, and prays to have her\r\nrespects presented to the ladies and yourself. In this I join her, and\r\nshall embrace with pleasure every opportunity of assuring you of the\r\nsincere esteem, with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BELLINI.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, September 30, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your estimable favor, covering a letter to Mr. Mazzei, came\r\nto hand on the 26th instant. The letter to Mr. Mazzei was put into his\r\nhands in the same moment, as he happened to be present. I leave to him\r\nto convey to you all his complaints, as it will be more agreeable to\r\nme to express to you the satisfaction I received, on being informed\r\nof your perfect health. Though I could not receive the same pleasing\r\nnews of Mrs. Bellini, yet the philosophy with which I am told she bears\r\nthe loss of health, is a testimony the more how much she deserved\r\nthe esteem I bear her. Behold me at length on the vaunted scene of\r\nEurope! It is not necessary for your information, that I should enter\r\ninto details concerning it. But you are, perhaps, curious to know how\r\nthis new scene has struck a savage of the mountains of America. Not\r\nadvantageously, I assure you. I find the general fate of humanity\r\nhere most deplorable. The truth of Voltaire's observation, offers\r\nitself perpetually, that every man here must be either the hammer or\r\nthe anvil. It is a true picture of that country to which they say we\r\nshall pass hereafter, and where we are to see God and his angels in\r\nsplendor, and crowds of the damned trampled under their feet. While the\r\ngreat mass of the people are thus suffering under physical and moral\r\noppression, I have endeavored to examine more nearly the condition of\r\nthe great, to appreciate the true value of the circumstances in their\r\nsituation, which dazzle the bulk of spectators, and, especially, to\r\ncompare it with that degree of happiness which is enjoyed in America,\r\nby every class of people. Intrigues of love occupy the younger, and\r\nthose of ambition, the elder part of the great. Conjugal love having\r\nno existence among them, domestic happiness, of which that is the\r\nbasis, is utterly unknown. In lieu of this, are substituted pursuits\r\nwhich nourish and invigorate all our bad passions, and which offer only\r\nmoments of ecstacy, amidst days and months of restlessness and torment.\r\nMuch, very much inferior, this, to the tranquil, permanent felicity\r\nwith which domestic society in America blesses most of its inhabitants;\r\nleaving them to follow steadily those pursuits which health and reason\r\napprove, and rendering truly delicious the intervals of those pursuits.\r\n\r\nIn science, the mass of the people are two centuries behind ours;\r\ntheir literati, half a dozen years before us. Books, really good,\r\nacquire just reputation in that time, and so become known to us, and\r\ncommunicate to us all their advances in knowledge. Is not this delay\r\ncompensated, by our being placed out of the reach of that swarm of\r\nnonsensical publications which issues daily from a thousand presses,\r\nand perishes almost in issuing? With respect to what are termed polite\r\nmanners, without sacrificing too much the sincerity of language, I\r\nwould wish my countrymen to adopt just so much of European politeness,\r\nas to be ready to make all those little sacrifices of self, which\r\nreally render European manners amiable, and relieve society from the\r\ndisagreeable scenes to which rudeness often subjects it. Here, it seems\r\nthat a man might pass a life without encountering a single rudeness. In\r\nthe pleasures of the table, they are far before us, because, with good\r\ntaste they unite temperance. They do not terminate the most sociable\r\nmeals by transforming themselves into brutes. I have never yet seen a\r\nman drunk in France, even among the lowest of the people. Were I to\r\nproceed to tell you how much I enjoy their architecture, sculpture,\r\npainting, music, I should want words. It is in these arts they shine.\r\nThe last of them, particularly, is an enjoyment, the deprivation of\r\nwhich with us, cannot be calculated. I am almost ready to say, it is\r\nthe only thing which from my heart I envy them, and which, in spite of\r\nall the authority of the Decalogue, I do covet. But I am running on\r\nin an estimate of things infinitely better known to you than to me,\r\nand which will only serve to convince you, that I have brought with\r\nme all the prejudices of country, habit, and age. But whatever I may\r\nallow to be charged to me as prejudice, in every other instance, I have\r\none sentiment at least, founded on reality: it is that of the perfect\r\nesteem which your merit and that of Mrs. Bellini have produced, and\r\nwhich will forever enable me to assure you of the sincere regard with\r\nwhich I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON, OF WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, October 2, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your favor of April the 10th, by Mr.\r\nMazzei. You therein speak of a new method of raising water by steam,\r\nwhich you suppose will come into general use. I know of no new method\r\nof that kind, and suppose (as you say the account you have received of\r\nit is very imperfect) that some person has represented to you, as new,\r\na fire engine erected at Paris, and which supplies the greater part of\r\nthe town with water. But this is nothing more than the fire engine you\r\nhave seen described in the books of hydraulics, and particularly in the\r\nDictionary of Arts and Sciences, published in 8vo, by Owen, the idea of\r\nwhich was first taken from Papin's Digester. It would have been better\r\ncalled the steam engine. The force of the steam of water, you know, is\r\nimmense. In this engine, it is made to exert itself towards the working\r\nof pumps. That of Paris is, I believe, the largest known, raising four\r\nhundred thousand cubic feet (French) of water, in twenty-four hours; or\r\nrather, I should have said, _those_ of Paris, for there are two under\r\none roof, each raising that quantity.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Rochon not living at Paris, I have not had an opportunity of\r\nseeing him, and of asking him the questions you desire, relative to\r\nthe crystal of which I wrote you. I shall avail myself of the earliest\r\nopportunity I can, of doing it. I shall cheerfully execute your\r\ncommands as to the Encyclopedie, when I receive them. The price will\r\nbe only thirty guineas. About half the work is out. The volumes of your\r\nBuffon which are spoiled, can be replaced here.\r\n\r\nI expect that this letter will be carried by the Mr. Fitzhughs, in a\r\nship from Havre to Portsmouth. I have therefore sent to Havre some\r\nbooks which I expected would be acceptable to you. These are the\r\nBibliothéque Physico-œconomique, which will give you most of the\r\nlate improvements in the Arts; the Connoissance des Tems for 1786 and\r\n1787, which is as late as they are published; and some pieces on air\r\nand fire, wherein you will find all the discoveries hitherto made on\r\nthese subjects. These books are made into a packet, with your address\r\non them, and are put into a trunk, wherein is a small packet for Mr.\r\nWythe, another for Mr. Page, and a parcel of books, without direction,\r\nfor Peter Carr. I have taken the liberty of directing the trunk to you,\r\nas the surest means of its getting safe. I pay the freight of it here,\r\nso that there will be no new demands, but for the transportation from\r\nthe ship's side to Williamsburg, which I will pray you to pay; and as\r\nmuch the greatest part is for my nephew, I will take care to repay it\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nIn the last volume of the Connoissance des Tems, you will find the\r\ntables for the planet Herschel. It is a curious circumstance, that this\r\nplanet was seen thirty years ago by Mayer, and supposed by him to be a\r\nfixed star. He accordingly determined a place for it, in his catalogue\r\nof the zodiacal stars, making it the 964th of that catalogue. Bode,\r\nof Berlin, observed in 1781 that this star was missing. Subsequent\r\ncalculations of the motion of the planet Herschel, show that it must\r\nhave been, at the time of Mayer's observation, where he had placed his\r\n964th star.\r\n\r\nHerschel has pushed his discoveries of double stars, now, to upwards\r\nof nine hundred, being twice the number of those communicated in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions. You have probably seen, that a Mr. Pigott\r\nhad discovered periodical variations of light in the star Algol. He has\r\nobserved the same in the η of Antinous, and makes the period of\r\nvariation seven days, four hours, and thirty minutes, the duration of\r\nthe increase sixty-three hours, and of the decrease thirty-six hours.\r\nWhat are we to conclude from this? That there are suns which have\r\ntheir orbits of revolution too? But this would suppose a wonderful\r\nharmony in their planets, and present a new scene, where the\r\nattracting powers should be without, and not within the orbit. The\r\nmotion of our sun would be a miniature of this. But this must be left\r\nto you astronomers.\r\n\r\nI went some time ago to see a machine which offers something new.\r\nA man had applied to a light boat a very large screw, the thread of\r\nwhich was a thin plate, two feet broad, applied by its edge spirally\r\naround a small axis. It somewhat resembled a bottle brush, if you will\r\nsuppose the hairs of the bottle brush joining together, and forming a\r\nspiral plane. This, turned on its axis in the air, carried the vessel\r\nacross the Seine. It is, in fact, a screw which takes hold of the air\r\nand draws itself along by it; losing, indeed, much of its effort by\r\nthe yielding nature of the body it lays hold of to pull itself on by.\r\nI think it may be applied in the water with much greater effect, and to\r\nvery useful purposes. Perhaps it may be used also for the balloon.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible but you must have heard long ago of the machine for\r\ncopying letters at a single stroke, as we had received it in America\r\nbefore I left there. I have written a long letter to my nephew, in\r\nwhose education I feel myself extremely interested. I shall rely much\r\non your friendship for conducting him in the plan I mark out for him,\r\nand for guarding him against those shoals on which youth sometimes\r\nshipwreck. I trouble you to present to Mr. Wythe my affectionate\r\nremembrance of him, and am, with very great esteem, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, October 5, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A vessel sailing from Havre to Philadelphia, furnishes the\r\nMessrs. Fitzhughs with a passage to that place. To them, therefore, I\r\nconfide a number of letters and packets which I have received for you\r\nfrom sundry quarters, and which, I doubt not, they will deliver safe.\r\nAmong these, is one from M. Du Plessis. On receipt of your letter, in\r\nanswer to the one I had written you, on the subject of his memorial,\r\nI sent to M. La Motte, M. Chaumont, and wherever else I thought there\r\nwas a probability of finding out Du Plessis' address. But all in vain.\r\nI meant to examine his memoir, as you desired, and to have it copied.\r\nLately, he came and brought it with him, copied by himself. He desired\r\nme to read it, and enclose it to you, which I have done.\r\n\r\nWe have no public news worth communicating to you, but the signing of\r\npreliminaries between the Emperor and Dutch. The question is, then,\r\nwith whom the Emperor will pick the next quarrel. Our treaty with\r\nPrussia goes by this conveyance. But it is not to be spoken of, till a\r\nconvenient time is allowed for exchanging ratifications.\r\n\r\nScience offers nothing new since your departure, nor any new\r\npublication worth your notice. All your friends here are well. Those\r\nin England, have carried you captive to Algiers. They have published\r\na letter, as if written by Truxen, the 20th of August, from Algiers,\r\nstating the circumstances of the capture, and that you bore your\r\nslavery to admiration. I happened to receive a letter from Algiers,\r\ndated August the 24th, informing me that two vessels were then\r\nthere, taken from us, and naming the vessels and captains. This was a\r\nsatisfactory proof to us, that you were not there. The fact being so,\r\nwe would have gladly dispensed with the proof, as the situation of our\r\ncountrymen there, was described as very distressing.\r\n\r\nWere I to mention all those who make inquiries after you, there would\r\nbe no end to my letter. I cannot, however, pass over those of the good\r\nold Countess d'Hoditot, with whom I dined on Saturday, at Sanois. They\r\nwere very affectionate. I hope you have had a good passage. Your essay\r\nin crossing the channel, gave us great hopes you would experience\r\nlittle inconvenience on the rest of the voyage. My wishes place you\r\nin the bosom of your friends, in good health, and with a well-grounded\r\nprospect of preserving it long, for your own sake, for theirs, and that\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nI am, with the sincerest attachment and respect, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL OSGOOD.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, October 5, 1785\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It was with very sincere pleasure, I heard of your\r\nappointment to the board of treasury, as well from the hope that it\r\nmight not be disagreeable to yourself, as from the confidence that your\r\nadministration would be wise. I heartily wish the States may, by their\r\ncontributions, enable you to re-establish a credit, which cannot be\r\nlower than at present, to exist at all. This is partly owing to their\r\nreal deficiencies, and partly to the lies propagated by the London\r\npapers, which are probably paid for by the minister, to reconcile the\r\npeople to the loss of us. Unluckily, it indisposes them, at the same\r\ntime, to form rational connections with us. Should this produce the\r\namendment of our federal constitution, of which your papers give us\r\nhopes, we shall receive a permanent indemnification for a temporary\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nAll things here, promise an arrangement between the Emperor and Dutch.\r\nTheir ministers have signed preliminary articles, some of which,\r\nhowever, leave room for further cavil. The Dutch pay ten millions of\r\nflorins, yield some forts and territory, and the navigation of the\r\nScheldt to Saftingen. Till our treaty with England be fully executed,\r\nit is desirable to us, that all the world should be in peace. That\r\ndone, their wars would do us little harm.\r\n\r\nI find myself under difficulties here, which I will take the liberty\r\nof explaining to you as a friend. Mr. Carmichael lately drew a bill\r\non Mr. Grand for four thousand livres, I suppose, for his salary. Mr.\r\nGrand said, he was not used to accept drafts but by the desire of Dr.\r\nFranklin, and rested it on me to say, whether this bill should be paid\r\nor not. I thought it improper, that the credit of so confidential\r\na person as Mr. Carmichael, should be affected by a refusal, and\r\ntherefore advised payment. Mr. Dumas has drawn on me for twenty-seven\r\nhundred livres, his half year's salary, informing me he always drew on\r\nDr. Franklin. I shall advise the payment. I have had loan office bills,\r\ndrawn on the commissioners of the United States, presented to me. My\r\nanswer has been, \"These are very old bills. Had they been presented\r\nwhile those gentlemen were in Europe, they would have been paid. You\r\nkept them up till Dr. Franklin, the last of them, has returned to\r\nAmerica; you must therefore send them there, and they will be paid.\r\nI am not the drawee described in the bill.\" It is impossible for me\r\nto meddle with these bills. The gentlemen who had been familiar with\r\nthem, from the beginning, who kept books of them, and knew well the\r\nform of these books, often paid bills twice. But how can I interfere\r\nwith them, who have not a scrip of a pen on their subject, who never\r\nsaw a book relating to them, and who, if I had the books, should much\r\noftener be bewildered in the labyrinth, than the gentlemen who have\r\nkept them? I think it, therefore, most advisable, that what bills\r\nremain out, should be sent back to America for payment, and therefore\r\nadvise Mr. Barclay to return thither, all the books and papers relative\r\nto them. There is the proper and ultimate deposit of all records of\r\nthis nature. All these articles are very foreign to my talents, and\r\nforeign also, as I conceive, to the nature of my duties. Dr. Franklin\r\nwas obliged to meddle with them, from the circumstances which existed.\r\nBut, these having ceased, I suppose it practicable for your board to\r\ndirect the administration of your moneys here, in every circumstance.\r\nIt is only necessary for me to draw my own allowances, and to order\r\npayment for services done by others, by my direction, and within the\r\nimmediate line of my office; such as paying couriers, postage, and\r\nother extraordinary services, which must rest on my discretion, and at\r\nmy risk, if disapproved by Congress. I will thank you for your advice\r\non this subject, and if you think a resolution of your board necessary,\r\nI will pray you to send me such a one, and that it may relieve me from\r\nall concerns with the money of the United States, other than those I\r\nhave just spoken of. I do not mean by this, to testify a disposition\r\nto render no service but what is rigorously within my duty. I am the\r\nfarthest in the world from this; it is a question I shall never ask\r\nmyself; nothing making me more happy than to render any service in\r\nmy power, of whatever description. But I wish only to be excused from\r\nintermeddling in business in which I have no skill, and should do more\r\nharm than good.\r\n\r\nCongress were pleased to order me an advance of two quarters' salary.\r\nAt that time, I supposed that I might refund it, or spare so much\r\nfrom my expenses, by the time the third quarter became due. Probably,\r\nthey might expect the same. But it has been impossible. The expense\r\nof my outfit, though I have taken it up, on a scale as small as could\r\nbe admitted, has been very far beyond what I had conceived. I have,\r\ntherefore, not only been unable to refund the advance ordered, but\r\nbeen obliged to go beyond it. I wished to have avoided so much, as was\r\noccasioned by the purchase of furniture. But those who hire furniture,\r\nasked me forty per cent. a year, for the use of it. It was better\r\nto buy, therefore; and this article, clothes, carriage, &c., have\r\namounted to considerably more than the advance ordered. Perhaps, it\r\nmay be thought reasonable to allow me an outfit. The usage of every\r\nother nation has established this, and reason really pleads for it. I\r\ndo not wish to make a shilling; but only my expenses to be defrayed,\r\nand in a moderate style. On the most moderate, which the reputation or\r\ninterest of those I serve, would admit, it will take me several years\r\nto liquidate the advances for my outfit. I mention this, to enable you\r\nto understand the necessities which have obliged me to call for more\r\nmoney than was probably expected, and, understanding them, to explain\r\nthem to others. Being perfectly disposed to conform myself decisively,\r\nto what shall be thought proper, you cannot oblige me more, than by\r\ncommunicating to me your sentiments hereon, which I shall receive as\r\nthose of a friend, and govern myself accordingly.\r\n\r\nI am, with the most perfect esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, October 6, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR--My letter of August the 30th, acknowledged the receipt of yours\r\nof July the 13th. Since that, I have received your letter of August\r\nthe 13th, enclosing a correspondence between the Marquis de La Fayette\r\nand Monsieur de Calonnes, and another of the same date, enclosing the\r\npapers in Fortin's case. I immediately wrote to M. Limozin, at Havre,\r\ndesiring he would send me a state of the case, and inform me what were\r\nthe difficulties which suspended its decision. He has promised me,\r\nby letter, to do this as soon as possible, and I shall not fail in\r\nattention to it.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and Dutch have signed preliminaries, which are now made\r\npublic. You will see them in the papers which accompany this. They\r\nstill leave a good deal to discussion. However, it is probable they\r\nwill end in peace. The party in Holland, possessed actually of the\r\nsovereignty, wish for peace, that they may push their designs on the\r\nStadtholderate. This country wishes for peace, because her finances\r\nneed arrangement. The Bavarian exchange has produced to public view,\r\nthat jealousy and rancor between the courts of Vienna and Berlin,\r\nwhich existed before, though it was smothered. This will appear by the\r\ndeclarations of the two courts. The demarcation between the Emperor\r\nand Turk does not advance. Still, however, I suppose neither of those\r\ntwo germs of war likely to open soon. I consider the conduct of France\r\nas the best evidence of this. If she had apprehended a war from either\r\nof those quarters, she would not have been so anxious to leave the\r\nEmperor one enemy the less, by placing him at peace with the Dutch.\r\nWhile she is exerting all her powers to preserve peace by land, and\r\nmaking no preparation which indicates a fear of its being disturbed\r\nin that quarter, she is pushing her naval preparations, with a spirit\r\nunexampled in time of peace. By the opening of the next spring, she\r\nwill have eighty ships, of seventy-four guns and upwards, ready for\r\nsea, at a moment's warning; and the further constructions proposed,\r\nwill probably, within two years, raise the number to an hundred. New\r\nregulations have been made, too, for perfecting the classification\r\nof her seamen; an institution, which, dividing all the seamen of the\r\nnation into classes, subjects them to tours of duty by rotation, and\r\nenables government, at all times, to man their ships. Their works for\r\nrendering Cherbourg a harbor for their vessels of war, and Dunkirk,\r\nfor frigates and privateers, leave now little doubt of success. It is\r\nimpossible that these preparations can have in view, any other nation\r\nthan the English. Of course, they show a greater diffidence of their\r\npeace with them, than with any other power.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to you, in my letter of August the 14th, that I had\r\ndesired Captain John Paul Jones to inquire into the circumstances of\r\nPeyrouse's expedition. I have now the honor of enclosing you copies\r\nof my letter to him, and of his answer. He refuses to accept of my\r\nindemnification for his expenses, which is an additional proof of his\r\ndisinterested spirit, and of his devotion to the service of America.\r\nThe circumstances are obvious, which indicate an intention to settle\r\nfactories, and not colonies, at least for the present. However, nothing\r\nshows for what place they are destined. The conjectures are divided\r\nbetween New Holland, and the Northwest coast of America.\r\n\r\nAccording to what I mentioned in my letter of August 30th, I have\r\nappointed Mr. Short my secretary here. I enclose to you copies of\r\nmy letters to him and Mr. Grand, which will show to Congress that he\r\nstands altogether at their pleasure. I mention this circumstance, that,\r\nif what I have done meets with their disapprobation, they may have the\r\ngoodness to signify it immediately, as I should otherwise conclude that\r\nthey do not disapprove it. I shall be ready to conform myself to what\r\nwould be most agreeable to them.\r\n\r\nThis will be accompanied by the gazettes of France and Leyden, to the\r\npresent date.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received, last night, the letter signed by yourself\r\nand the other gentlemen, delegates of Massachusetts and Virginia,\r\nrecommending Mr. Sayer for the Barbary negotiations. As that was the\r\nfirst moment of its suggestion to me, you will perceive, by my letter\r\nof this day, to Mr. Jay, that the business was already established\r\nin other hands, as your letter came at the same time with the papers\r\nactually signed by Mr. Adams, for Messrs. Barclay and Lambe, according\r\nto arrangements previously taken between us. I should, with great\r\nsatisfaction, have acceded to the recommendation in the letter: not\r\nindeed as to Morocco, because, no better man than Mr. Barclay could\r\nhave been substituted; but as to Algiers, Mr. Lambe being less known\r\nto me. However, I hope well of him, and rely considerably on the aid\r\nhe will receive from his secretary, Mr. Randall, who bears a very good\r\ncharacter. I suppose Mr. Adams entitled to the same just apology,\r\nas matters were settled otherwise, before he probably received your\r\nletter. I pray you to communicate this to the other gentlemen of your\r\nand our delegation, as my justification.\r\n\r\nThe peace made between the Emperor and Dutch leaves Europe quiet for\r\nthis campaign. As yet, we do not know where the storm, dissipated for\r\nthe moment, will gather again. Probably over Bavaria or Turkey. But\r\nthis will be for another year.\r\n\r\nWhen our instructions were made out, they were conceived on a general\r\nscale, and supposed that all the European nations would be disposed\r\nto form commercial connections with us. It is evident, however, that\r\na very different degree of importance was annexed to these different\r\nStates. Spain, Portugal, England and France, were most important.\r\nHolland, Sweden, Denmark, in a middling degree. The others, still less\r\nso. Spain treats in another line. Portugal is disposed to do the same.\r\nEngland will not treat at all; nor will France, probably, add to her\r\nformer treaty. Failing in the execution of these our capital objects,\r\nit has appeared to me that the pushing the treaties with the lesser\r\npowers might do us more harm than good, by hampering the measures the\r\nStates may find it necessary to take, for securing those commercial\r\ninterests, by separate measures, which is refused to be done here, in\r\nconcert. I have understood through various channels, that the members\r\nof Congress wished a change in our instructions. I have, in my letter\r\nto Mr. Jay, of this date, mentioned the present situation and aspect of\r\nthese treaties, for their information.\r\n\r\nMy letter of the 6th instant, to Mr. Jay, having communicated what\r\nlittle there is new here, I have only to add assurances of the sincere\r\nesteem with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency a report of\r\nthe voyage of an American ship, the first which has gone to China. The\r\ncircumstances which induces Congress to direct this communication is\r\nthe very friendly conduct of the consul of his Majesty at Macao, and\r\nof the commanders and other officers of the French vessels in those\r\nseas. It has been with singular satisfaction that Congress have seen\r\nthese added to the many other proofs of the cordiality of this nation\r\ntowards our citizens. It is the more pleasing, when it appears in the\r\nofficers of government, because it is then viewed as an emanation of\r\nthe spirit of the government. It would be an additional gratification\r\nto Congress, in this particular instance, should any occasion arise\r\nof notifying those officers, that their conduct has been justly\r\nrepresented to your Excellency on the part of the United States, and\r\nhas met your approbation. Nothing will be wanting, on our part, to\r\nfoster corresponding dispositions in our citizens, and we hope that\r\nproofs of their actual existence have appeared, and will appear,\r\nwhenever occasion shall offer. A sincere affection between the two\r\npeople is the broadest basis on which their peace can be built.\r\n\r\nIt will always be among the most pleasing functions of my office, to be\r\nmade the channel of communicating the friendly sentiments of the two\r\ngovernments. It is additionally so, as it gives me an opportunity of\r\nassuring your Excellency of the high respect and esteem with which I\r\nhave the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In my letter of August the 14th, I had the honor of expressing\r\nto you the uneasiness I felt, at the delay of the instructions on the\r\nsubject of the Barbary treaties, of which Mr. Lambe was the bearer,\r\nand of informing you that I had proposed to Mr. Adams, that if he did\r\nnot arrive either in the French or English packets, then expected,\r\nwe should send some person to negotiate these treaties. As he did\r\nnot arrive in those packets, and I found Mr. Barclay was willing to\r\nundertake the negotiations, I wrote to Mr. Adams (who had concurred in\r\nthe proposition made him), informing him that Mr. Barclay would go,\r\nand proposing papers for our immediate signature. The day before the\r\nreturn of the courier, Mr. Lambe arrived with our instructions, the\r\nletters of credence, &c., enclosed in yours of March the 11th, 1785.\r\nJust about the same time, came to hand the letter No. 1, informing\r\nme, that two American vessels were actually taken and carried into\r\nAlgiers, and leaving no further doubt that that power was exercising\r\nhostilities against us, in the Atlantic. The conduct of the Emperor of\r\nMorocco had been such, as forbade us to postpone his treaty to that\r\nwith Algiers. But the commencement of hostilities by the latter, and\r\ntheir own activity, pressed the necessity of immediate propositions\r\nto them. It was therefore thought best, while Mr. Barclay should be\r\nproceeding with the Emperor of Morocco, that some other agent should go\r\nto Algiers. We had few subjects to choose out of. Mr. Lambe's knowledge\r\nof the country, of its inhabitants, of their manner of transacting\r\nbusiness, the recommendations from his State to Congress of his fitness\r\nfor this employment, and other information founding a presumption\r\nthat he would be approved, occasioned our concluding to send him to\r\nAlgiers. The giving him proper authorities, and new ones to Mr. Barclay\r\nconformable to our own powers, was the subject of a new courier between\r\nMr. Adams and myself. He returned last night, and I had the honor of\r\nenclosing you copies of all the papers we furnish those gentlemen with;\r\nwhich will possess Congress fully of our proceedings herein. They are\r\nnumbered from two to ten inclusive. The supplementary instruction to\r\nMr. Lambe, No. 5, must rest for justification on the emergency of the\r\ncase. The motives which led to it must be found in the feelings of the\r\nhuman heart, in a partiality for those sufferers who are of our own\r\ncountry, and in the obligations of every government to yield protection\r\nto their citizens, as the consideration of their obedience. It will be\r\na comfort to know that Congress does not disapprove this step.\r\n\r\nConsidering the treaty with Portugal among the most interesting to\r\nthe United States, I some time ago took occasion at Versailles, to ask\r\nof the Portuguese ambassador if he had yet received from his court an\r\nanswer to our letter. He told me he had not; but that he would make it\r\nthe subject of another letter. Two days ago, his secretaire d'ambassade\r\ncalled on me, with a letter from his minister to the ambassador,\r\nin which was the following paragraph, as he translated it to me;\r\nand I committed it to writing from his mouth. \"Your Excellency has\r\ncommunicated to us the substance of your conversation with the American\r\nminister. That power ought to have been already persuaded, by the\r\nmanner in which its vessels have been received here; and consequently\r\nthat his Majesty would have much satisfaction, in maintaining perfect\r\nharmony and good understanding with the same United States. But it\r\nwould be proper to begin with the reciprocal nomination, on both\r\nsides, of persons, who, at least with the character of agents, might\r\nreciprocally inform their constituents of what might conduce to a\r\nknowledge of the interests of the two nations, without prejudice to\r\neither. This first step appears necessary to lead to the proposed\r\nobject.\"\r\n\r\nBy this, it would seem, that this power is more disposed to pursue a\r\ntrack of negotiation, similar to that which Spain has done. I consider\r\nthis answer as definitive of all further measures, under our commission\r\nto Portugal. That to Spain was superseded by proceedings in another\r\nline. That to Prussia is concluded by actual treaty; to Tuscany will\r\nprobably be so; and perhaps to Denmark; and these, I believe, will\r\nbe the sum of the effects of our commissions for making treaties of\r\nalliance. England shows no disposition to treat. France, should her\r\nministers be able to keep the ground of the _Arret_ of August 1784\r\nagainst the clamors of her merchants, and should they be disposed,\r\nhereafter, to give us more, very probably will not bind herself to it\r\nby treaty, but keep her regulations dependent on her own will. Sweden\r\nwill establish a free port at St. Bartholemew's, which, perhaps, will\r\nrender any new engagement, on our part, unnecessary. Holland is so\r\nimmovable in her system of colony administration, that, as propositions\r\nto her, on that subject, would be desperate, they had better not be\r\nmade. You will perceive by the letter No. 11, from the Marquis de La\r\nFayette, that there is a possibility of an overture from the Emperor.\r\nA hint from the chargé des affaires of Naples, lately, has induced me\r\nto suppose something of the same kind from thence. But the advanced\r\nperiod of our commissions now offers good cause for avoiding to begin\r\nwhat probably cannot be terminated during their continuance; and with\r\nrespect to these two, and all other powers not before mentioned, I\r\ndoubt whether the advantages to be derived from treaties with them\r\nwill countervail the additional embarrassments they may impose on the\r\nStates, when they shall proceed to make those commercial arrangements\r\nnecessary to counteract the designs of the British cabinet. I repeat\r\nit, therefore, that the conclusion of the treaty with Prussia, and the\r\nprobability of others with Denmark, Tuscany, and the Barbary States,\r\nmay be expected to wind up the proceedings of the general commissions.\r\nI think that, in possible events, it may be advantageous to us, by\r\ntreaties with Prussia, Denmark, and Tuscany, to have secured ports\r\nin Northern and Mediterranean seas. I have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the highest respect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Colonel Franks and Mr. Randolph arrived last night. This\r\nenables me to send copies of all the Barbary papers to Congress by\r\nthe Mr. Fitzhughs, together with the Prussian treaty. They wait till\r\nto-morrow for that purpose. Considering the treaty with Portugal as\r\namong the most important to the United States, I, some time ago, took\r\noccasion at Versailles to ask the Portuguese Ambassador if he had not\r\nreceived an answer from his court on the subject of our treaty. He said\r\nnot, but that he would write again. His secretaire de ambassade called\r\non me two days ago, and translated into French, as follows, a paragraph\r\nof a letter from his minister to the ambassador: \"Relativement à ce que\r\nV. E. nous a fait part de ce qu'elle avoit parlé avec le ministre de\r\nl'Amerique, cette puissance doit être déjà persuadée par d'effets la\r\nmanière dont ses vaisseaux ont été accueillis ici; et par conséquence\r\nsa majesté auroit beaucoup de satisfaction à entretenir une parfaite\r\nharmonie et bon correspondence entre les mêmes Etats Unis. Mais il\r\nseroit à propos de commencer par la nomination réciproque des deux\r\nparties des personnes, qui, au moins avec la caractère d'agens,\r\ninformeroient réciproquement leurs constituents de ce qui pourroit\r\nconduire à la connoisance des intérêts des deux nations sans préjudice\r\nde l'un ou de l'autre. C'est le premier pas qu'il paroit convenable de\r\ndonner pour conduire à la fin proposée.\" By this, I suppose, they will\r\nprefer proceeding as Spain has done, and that we may consider it as\r\ndefinitive of our commission to them. I communicate it to Congress that\r\nthey may take such other measures for leading on a negotiation as they\r\nmay think proper.\r\n\r\nYou know that the 3d article of instructions of October 29, 1783, to\r\nthe ministers for negotiating peace, directed them to negotiate the\r\nclaim for the prizes taken by the alliance and sent into Bergen, but\r\ndelivered up by the Court of Denmark; you recollect, also, that this\r\nhas been deferred in order to be taken up with the general negotiation\r\nfor an alliance. Captain Jones, desiring to go to America, proposed to\r\nme that he should leave the solicitation of this matter in the hands of\r\nDoctor Bancroft, and to ask you to negotiate it, through the minister\r\nof Denmark at London. The delay of Baron Waltersdorf is one reason\r\nfor this. Your better acquaintance with the subject is a second. The\r\nDanish minister here being absent, is a third. And a fourth and more\r\nconclusive one is that, having never acted as one of the commissioners\r\nfor negotiating the peace, I feel an impropriety in meddling with it\r\nat all, and much more to become the principal agent. I therefore told\r\nCaptain Jones I would solicit your care of this business. I believe he\r\nwrites to you on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay sets out in two or three days. Lambe will follow as soon as\r\nthe papers can be got from this ministry. Having no news, I shall only\r\nadd assurances of the esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. VAN STAPHORST.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 12, 1785.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--The receipt of your favor, of September the 19th, should\r\nnot have been so long unacknowledged, but that I have been peculiarly\r\nand very closely engaged ever since it came to hand.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the expediency of the arrangement you propose to make\r\nwith Mr. Parker, I must observe to you, that it would be altogether\r\nout of my province to give an official opinion for your direction.\r\nThese transactions appertain altogether to the commissioners of the\r\ntreasury, to whom you have very properly written on the occasion. I\r\nshall always be willing, however, to apprise you of any facts I may\r\nbe acquainted with, and which might enable you to proceed with more\r\ncertainty; and even to give my private opinion, where I am acquainted\r\nwith the subject, leaving you the most perfect liberty to give it\r\nwhat weight you may think proper. In the present case, I cannot give\r\neven a private opinion, because I am not told what are precisely the\r\nsecurities offered by Mr. Parker. So various are the securities of\r\nthe United States, that unless they are precisely described by their\r\ndates, consideration, and other material circumstances, no man on earth\r\ncan say what they are worth. One fact, however, is certain, that all\r\ndebts of any considerable amount contracted by the United States, while\r\ntheir paper money existed, are subject to a deduction, and not payable\r\nat any fixed period. I think I may venture to say, also, that there\r\nare no debts of the United States, \"on the same footing with the money\r\nloaned by Holland,\" except those due to the Kings of France and Spain.\r\nHowever, I hope you will soon receive the answer of the commissioners,\r\nwhich alone can decide authoritatively what is to be done.\r\n\r\nCongress have thought proper to entrust to Mr. Adams and myself a\r\ncertain business, which may eventually call for great advances of\r\nmoney, perhaps four hundred thousand livres or upwards. They have\r\nauthorized us to draw for this on their funds in Holland. The separate\r\nsituation of Mr. Adams and myself, rendering joint drafts inconvenient,\r\nwe have agreed that they shall be made by him alone. You will be\r\npleased, therefore, to give the same credit to these bills, drawn by\r\nhim, as if they were also subscribed by me.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high respect, Gentlemen, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DESBORDES.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 12, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--There are in the prison of St. Pol de Leon six or seven citizens\r\nof the United States of America, charged with having attempted a\r\ncontraband of tobacco, but, as they say themselves, forced into that\r\nport by stress of weather. I believe that they are innocent. Their\r\nsituation is described me to be as deplorable as should be that of men\r\nfound guilty of the worst of crimes. They are in close jail, allowed\r\nthree sous a day only, and unable to speak a word of the language of\r\nthe country. I hope their distress, which it is my duty to relieve,\r\nand the recommendation of Mr. Barclay to address myself to you, will\r\napologize for the liberty I take of asking you to advise them what\r\nto do for their defence, to engage some good lawyer for them, and to\r\npass to them the pecuniary reliefs necessary. I write to Mr. Lister\r\nAsquith, the owner of the vessel, that he may draw bills on me, from\r\ntime to time, for a livre a day for every person of them, and what may\r\nbe necessary to engage a lawyer for him. I will pray the favor of you\r\nto furnish him money for his bills, drawn on me for these purposes,\r\nwhich I will pay on sight. You will judge if he should go beyond this\r\nallowance, and be so good as to reject the surplus. I must desire his\r\nlawyer to send me immediately a state of their case, and let me know\r\nin what court their process is, and when it is likely to be decided.\r\nI hope the circumstances of the case will excuse the freedom I take;\r\nand I have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HOGENDORP.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 13, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Having been much engaged lately, I have been unable sooner\r\nto acknowledge the receipt of your favor of September the 8th. What\r\nyou are pleased to say on the subject of my Notes is more than they\r\ndeserve. The condition in which you first saw them would prove to you\r\nhow hastily they had been originally written, as you may remember the\r\nnumerous insertions I had made in them from time to time, when I could\r\nfind a moment for turning to them from other occupations. I have never\r\nyet seen Monsieur de Buffon. He has been in the country all the summer.\r\nI sent him a copy of the book, and have only heard his sentiments on\r\none particular of it, that of the identity of the mammoth and elephant.\r\nAs to this, he retains his opinion that they are the same. If you had\r\nformed any considerable expectations from our revised code of laws,\r\nyou will be much disappointed. It contains not more than three or four\r\nlaws which could strike the attention of a foreigner. Had it been\r\na digest of all our laws, it would not have been comprehensible or\r\ninstructive but to a native. But it is still less so, as it digests\r\nonly the British statutes and our own acts of Assembly, which are but\r\na supplementary part of our law. The great basis of it is anterior to\r\nthe date of the Magna Charta, which is the oldest statute extant. The\r\nonly merit of this work is, that it may remove from our book shelves\r\nabout twenty folio volumes of our statutes, retaining all the parts\r\nof them which either their own merit or the established system of laws\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nYou ask me what are those operations of the British nation which are\r\nlikely to befriend us, and how they will produce this effect? The\r\nBritish government, as you may naturally suppose, have it much at heart\r\nto reconcile their nation to the loss of America. This is essential to\r\nthe repose, perhaps even to the safety of the King and his ministers.\r\nThe most effectual engines for this purpose are the public papers. You\r\nknow well that that government always kept a kind of standing army of\r\nnews-writers, who, without any regard to truth, or to what should be\r\nlike truth, invented and put into the papers whatever might serve the\r\nministers. This suffices with the mass of the people, who have no means\r\nof distinguishing the false from the true paragraphs of a newspaper.\r\nWhen forced to acknowledge our independence, they were forced to\r\nredouble their efforts to keep the nation quiet. Instead of a few of\r\nthe papers formerly engaged, they now engaged every one. No paper,\r\ntherefore, comes out without a dose of paragraphs against America.\r\nThese are calculated for a secondary purpose also, that of preventing\r\nthe emigrations of their people to America. They dwell very much on\r\nAmerican bankruptcies. To explain these would require a long detail,\r\nbut would show you that nine-tenths of these bankruptcies are truly\r\nEnglish bankruptcies, in no wise chargeable on America. However, they\r\nhave produced effects the most desirable of all others for us. They\r\nhave destroyed our credit, and thus checked our disposition to luxury;\r\nand, forcing our merchants to buy no more than they have ready money\r\nto pay for, they force them to go to those markets where that ready\r\nmoney will buy most. Thus you see, they check our luxury, they force\r\nus to connect ourselves with all the world, and they prevent foreign\r\nemigrations to our country, all of which I consider as advantageous\r\nto us. They are doing us another good turn. They attempt, without\r\ndisguise, to possess themselves of the carriage of our produce, and\r\nto prohibit our own vessels from participating of it. This has raised\r\na general indignation in America. The States see, however, that their\r\nconstitutions have provided no means of counteracting it. They are,\r\ntherefore, beginning to invest Congress with the absolute power of\r\nregulating their commerce, only reserving all revenue arising from it\r\nto the State in which it is levied. This will consolidate our federal\r\nbuilding very much, and for this we shall be indebted to the British.\r\n\r\nYou ask what I think on the expediency of encouraging our States to\r\nbe commercial? Were I to indulge my own theory, I should wish them to\r\npractise neither commerce nor navigation, but to stand, with respect to\r\nEurope, precisely on the footing of China. We should thus avoid wars,\r\nand all our citizens would be husbandmen. Whenever, indeed, our numbers\r\nshould so increase as that our produce would overstock the markets\r\nof those nations who should come to seek it, the farmers must either\r\nemploy the surplus of their time in manufactures, or the surplus of\r\nour hands must be employed in manufactures or in navigation. But that\r\nday would, I think, be distant, and we should long keep our workmen\r\nin Europe, while Europe should be drawing rough materials, and even\r\nsubsistence from America. But this is theory only, and a theory which\r\nthe servants of America are not at liberty to follow. Our people have\r\na decided taste for navigation and commerce. They take this from their\r\nmother country; and their servants are in duty bound to calculate all\r\ntheir measures on this datum: we wish to do it by throwing open all the\r\ndoors of commerce, and knocking off its shackles. But as this cannot be\r\ndone for others, unless they will do it for us, and there is no great\r\nprobability that Europe will do this, I suppose we shall be obliged to\r\nadopt a system which may shackle them in our ports, as they do us in\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the sale of our lands, that cannot begin till a\r\nconsiderable portion shall have been surveyed. They cannot begin to\r\nsurvey till the fall of the leaf of this year, nor to sell probably\r\ntill the ensuing spring. So that it will be yet a twelvemonth before\r\nwe shall be able to judge of the efficacy of our land office to sink\r\nour national debt. It is made a fundamental, that the proceeds shall be\r\nsolely and sacredly applied as a sinking fund to discharge the capital\r\nonly of the debt.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the tobaccos of Virginia go almost entirely to England.\r\nThe reason is, the people of that State owe a great debt there, which\r\nthey are paying as fast as they can. I think I have now answered your\r\nseveral queries, and shall be happy to receive your reflections on the\r\nsame subjects, and at all times to hear of your welfare, and to give\r\nyou assurances of the esteem, with which I have the honor to be, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. BANNISTER, JUNIOR\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 15, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I should sooner have answered the paragraph in your\r\nletter, of September the 19th, respecting the best seminary for the\r\neducation of youth in Europe, but that it was necessary for me to make\r\ninquiries on the subject. The result of these has been, to consider\r\nthe competition as resting between Geneva and Rome. They are equally\r\ncheap, and probably are equal in the course of education pursued.\r\nThe advantage of Geneva is, that students acquire there the habit of\r\nspeaking French. The advantages of Rome are, the acquiring a local\r\nknowledge of a spot so classical and so celebrated; the acquiring the\r\ntrue pronunciation of the Latin language; a just taste in the fine\r\narts, more particularly those of painting, sculpture, architecture, and\r\nmusic; a familiarity with those objects and processes of agriculture\r\nwhich experience has shown best adapted to a climate like ours; and\r\nlastly, the advantage of a fine climate for health. It is probable,\r\ntoo, that by being boarded in a French family, the habit of speaking\r\nthat language may be obtained. I do not count on any advantage to be\r\nderived, in Geneva, from a familiar acquaintance with the principles\r\nof that government. The late revolution has rendered it a tyrannical\r\naristocracy, more likely to give ill than good ideas to an American.\r\nI think the balance in favor of Rome. Pisa is sometimes spoken of\r\nas a place of education. But it does not offer the first and third\r\nof the advantages of Rome. But why send an American youth to Europe\r\nfor education? What are the objects of an useful American education?\r\nClassical knowledge, modern languages, chiefly French, Spanish, and\r\nItalian; Mathematics, Natural philosophy, Natural history, Civil\r\nhistory, and Ethics. In Natural philosophy, I mean to include Chemistry\r\nand Agriculture, and in natural history, to include Botany, as well as\r\nthe other branches of those departments. It is true that the habit of\r\nspeaking the modern languages cannot be so well acquired in America;\r\nbut every other article can be as well acquired at William and Mary\r\ncollege, as at any place in Europe. When college education is done\r\nwith, and a young man is to prepare himself for public life, he must\r\ncast his eyes (for America) either on Law or Physics. For the former,\r\nwhere can he apply so advantageously as to Mr. Wythe? For the latter,\r\nhe must come to Europe: the medical class of students, therefore, is\r\nthe only one which need come to Europe. Let us view the disadvantages\r\nof sending a youth to Europe. To enumerate them all, would require a\r\nvolume. I will select a few. If he goes to England, he learns drinking,\r\nhorse racing, and boxing. These are the peculiarities of English\r\neducation. The following circumstances are common to education in\r\nthat, and the other countries of Europe. He acquires a fondness for\r\nEuropean luxury and dissipation, and a contempt for the simplicity of\r\nhis own country; he is fascinated with the privileges of the European\r\naristocrats, and sees, with abhorrence, the lovely equality which the\r\npoor enjoy with the rich, in his own country; he contracts a partiality\r\nfor aristocracy or monarchy; he forms foreign friendships which will\r\nnever be useful to him, and loses the seasons of life for forming, in\r\nhis own country, those friendships which, of all others, are the most\r\nfaithful and permanent; he is led, by the strongest of all the human\r\npassions, into a spirit for female intrigue, destructive of his own\r\nand others' happiness, or a passion for whores, destructive of his\r\nhealth, and, in both cases, learns to consider fidelity to the marriage\r\nbed as an ungentlemanly practice, and inconsistent with happiness:\r\nhe recollects the voluptuary dress and arts of the European women,\r\nand pities and despises the chaste affections and simplicity of those\r\nof his own country; he retains, through life, a fond recollection,\r\nand a hankering after those places, which were the scenes of his\r\nfirst pleasures and of his first connections; he returns to his own\r\ncountry, a foreigner, unacquainted with the practices of domestic\r\neconomy, necessary to preserve him from ruin, speaking and writing\r\nhis native tongue as a foreigner, and therefore unqualified to obtain\r\nthose distinctions, which eloquence of the pen and tongue ensures\r\nin a free country; for I would observe to you, that what is called\r\nstyle in writing or speaking is formed very early in life, while the\r\nimagination is warm, and impressions are permanent. I am of opinion,\r\nthat there never was an instance of a man's writing or speaking his\r\nnative tongue with elegance, who passed from fifteen to twenty years\r\nof age out of the country where it was spoken. Thus, no instance\r\nexists of a person's writing two languages perfectly. That will always\r\nappear to be his native language, which was most familiar to him in\r\nhis youth. It appears to me, then, that an American, coming to Europe\r\nfor education, loses in his knowledge, in his morals, in his health, in\r\nhis habits, and in his happiness. I had entertained only doubts on this\r\nhead before I came to Europe: what I see and hear, since I came here,\r\nproves more than I had even suspected. Cast your eye over America: who\r\nare the men of most learning, of most eloquence, most beloved by their\r\ncountrymen and most trusted and promoted by them? They are those who\r\nhave been educated among them, and whose manners, morals, and habits,\r\nare perfectly homogeneous with those of the country.\r\n\r\nDid you expect by so short a question, to draw such a sermon on\r\nyourself? I dare say you did not. But the consequences of foreign\r\neducation are alarming to me, as an American. I sin, therefore, through\r\nzeal, whenever I enter on the subject. You are sufficiently American\r\nto pardon me for it. Let me hear of your health, and be assured of the\r\nesteem with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BARON THULEMEYER.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 16, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am to acknowledge the receipt of the letter of the 11th\r\ninstant, with which you have honored me, and wherein you are pleased\r\nto inform me of the satisfaction of his Prussian majesty of the treaty\r\nof amity and commerce between him and the United States of America.\r\nOn our part, the earliest opportunity was embraced of forwarding it\r\nto Congress. It goes by a vessel sailing about this time from Havre.\r\nI shall with great pleasure communicate to you its ratification by\r\nCongress, in the first moment in which it shall become known to me, and\r\nconcur in the measures necessary for exchanging the ratifications.\r\n\r\nI shall take the greatest care to forward the letter you are pleased to\r\nenclose for Baltimore, according to its address.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the greatest respect and\r\nesteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 18, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 29th of September, came safely to hand:\r\nthe constant expectation of the departure of the persons whom I\r\nformerly gave you reason to expect has prevented my writing, as it\r\nhas done yours. They will probably leave this in a week, but their\r\nroute will be circuitous and attended with delays. Between the middle\r\nand last of November, they may be with you. By them, you will receive\r\na cypher, by which you may communicate with Mr. Adams and myself. I\r\nshould have sent it by Baron Dreyer, the Danish minister; but I then\r\nexpected our own conveyance would have been quicker. Having mentioned\r\nthis gentleman, give me leave to recommend him to your acquaintance. He\r\nis plain, sensible, and open: he speaks English well, and had he been\r\nto remain here, I should have cultivated his acquaintance much. Be so\r\ngood as to present me very respectfully to him.\r\n\r\nThis being to go by post, I shall only add the few articles of general\r\nAmerican news, by the last packet. Dr. Franklin arrived in good\r\nhealth at Philadelphia, the 15th ult., and was received amidst the\r\nacclamations of an immense crowd. No late event has produced greater\r\ndemonstrations of joy. It is doubted whether Congress will adjourn this\r\nsummer; but they are so thin, they do not undertake important business.\r\nOur western posts are in statu quo.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COUNT DE ARANDA.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 22, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The friendly dispositions which the Court of Madrid have\r\nbeen pleased to show towards us in our affairs relative to the\r\nBarbary Powers, induce me to trouble you with an application on that\r\nsubject. We are about sending persons to Morocco and Algiers to form\r\narrangements with those powers. They will go by the way of Madrid.\r\nI ask the favor of your Excellency's passports for them. It would\r\nincrease their value much if they could protect those persons from\r\nhaving their baggage searched. The one going to Morocco takes with him\r\nabout a thousand guineas worth of watches, rings, and other things\r\nof that nature: he who goes to Algiers takes about a fourth of that\r\nvalue. I pledge myself that these, with their necessary clothes, will\r\nconstitute the whole of their baggage, and that these are neither to\r\nbe sold nor left in Spain. The duties to which these things would be\r\nsubject are of no consideration with us. It is to avoid the delays, the\r\ndifficulties, and even the losses which may accrue from the examination\r\nof small and precious things on the road. Two separate passports will\r\nbe acceptable: the one for Thomas Barclay, and David S. Franks, and\r\ntheir servants; the other for John Lambe and ---- Randall, and their\r\nservants. We propose to keep these transactions as much as we can from\r\nthe eyes of the public.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. VAN STAPHORSTS.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, October 25, 1785.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I received yesterday your favor of the 20th instant. In\r\norder to give you the information you desire on the subject of the\r\n_liquidated_ debts of the United States, and the comparative footing\r\non which they stand, I must observe to you, that the first and great\r\ndivision of our federal debt, is, into 1, foreign; and 2, domestic. The\r\nforeign debt comprehends, 1, the loan from the government of Spain; 2,\r\nthe loans from the government of France, and from the Farmers General;\r\n3, the loans negotiated in Holland, by order of Congress. This branch\r\nof our debt stands absolutely singular; no man in the United States\r\nhaving ever supposed that Congress, or their legislatures, can, in any\r\nwise, modify or alter it. They justly view the United States as the\r\none party, and the lenders as the other, and that the consent of both\r\nwould be requisite, were any modification to be proposed. But with\r\nrespect to the domestic debt, they consider Congress as representing\r\nboth the borrowers and lenders, and that the modifications which have\r\ntaken place in this have been necessary to do justice between the two\r\nparties, and that they flowed properly from Congress as their mutual\r\numpire. The domestic debt comprehends 1, the army debt; 2, the loan\r\noffice debt; 3, the liquidated debt; and 4, the unliquidated debt.\r\nThe first term includes debts to the officers and soldiers for pay,\r\nbounty and subsistence. The second term means moneys put into the\r\nloan office of the United States. The third comprehends all debts\r\ncontracted by quarter-masters, commissaries, and others duly authorized\r\nto procure supplies for the army, and which have been liquidated\r\n(that is, settled) by commissioners appointed under the resolution\r\nof Congress, of June the 12th, 1780, or by the officer who made the\r\ncontract. The fourth comprehends the whole mass of debts, described in\r\nthe preceding article, which have not yet been liquidated. These are\r\nin a course of liquidation, and are passing over daily into the third\r\nclass. The debts of this third class, that is, the liquidated debt,\r\nis the object of your inquiry. No time is fixed for the payment of it,\r\nno fund as yet determined, nor any firm provision for the interest in\r\nthe meantime. The consequence is, that the certificates of these debts\r\nsell greatly below par. When I left America, they could be bought for\r\nfrom two shillings and sixpence to fifteen shillings in the pound:\r\nthis difference proceeding from the circumstance of some States having\r\nprovided for paying the interest on those due in their own State,\r\nwhich others had not. Hence, an opinion had arisen with some, and\r\npropositions had even been made in the legislatures, for paying off\r\nthe principal of these debts with what they had cost the holder, and\r\ninterest on that. This opinion is far from being general, and I think\r\nwill not prevail. But it is among possible events.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular, that you may be able to judge, not only\r\nin the present case, but also in others, should any attempts be made\r\nto speculate in your city, on these papers. It is a business, in which\r\nforeigners will be in great danger of being duped. It is a science\r\nwhich bids defiance to the powers of reason. To understand it, a man\r\nmust not only be on the spot, and be perfectly possessed of all the\r\ncircumstances relative to every species of these papers, but he must\r\nhave that dexterity which the habit of buying and selling them alone\r\ngives. The brokers of these certificates are few in number, and any\r\nother person venturing to deal with them, engages in a very unequal\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect, gentlemen, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, November 4, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had the honor of writing you on the 18th of October,\r\nand again, on the 25th of the same month. Both letters, being to pass\r\nthrough the post offices, were confined to particular subjects. The\r\nfirst of them acknowledged the receipt of yours, of September the 29th.\r\n\r\nAt length a confidential opportunity arrives for conveying to you\r\na cypher; it will be handed you by the bearer, Mr. Lambe. Copies\r\nof it are in the hands of Mr. Adams, at London, Mr. Barclay, who is\r\nproceeding to Morocco, and Mr. Lambe, who is proceeding to Algiers.\r\nThis enables us to keep up such correspondences with each other, as\r\nmay be requisite. Congress, in the spring of 1784, gave powers to Mr.\r\nAdams, Dr. Franklin and myself, to treat with the Barbary States. But\r\nthey gave us no money for them, and the other duties assigned us render\r\nit impossible for us to proceed thither in person. These things having\r\nbeen represented to them, they assigned to us a certain sum of money,\r\nand gave us powers to delegate agents to treat with those States, and\r\nto form preliminary articles, but confining to us the signing of them\r\nin a definitive form. They did not restrain us in the appointment\r\nof the agents; but the orders of Congress were brought to us by Mr.\r\nLambe, they had waited for him four months, and the recommendations he\r\nbrought pointed him out, in our opinion, as a person who would meet\r\nthe approbation of Congress. We therefore appointed him to negotiate\r\nwith the Algerines. His manners and appearance are not promising. But\r\nhe is a sensible man, and seems to possess some talents which may be\r\nproper in a matter of bargain. We have joined with him, as secretary,\r\na Mr. Randall, from New York, in whose prudence we hope he will find\r\nconsiderable aid. They now proceed to Madrid, merely with the view of\r\nseeing you, as we are assured they will receive from you lights which\r\nmay be useful to them. I hear that d'Expilly and the Algerine ministers\r\nhave gone from Madrid. Letters from Algiers, of August the 24th, inform\r\nme that we had two vessels and their crews in captivity there, at that\r\ntime. I never had reason to believe, certainly, that any others had\r\nbeen captured. Should Mr. Lambe have occasion to draw bills, while in\r\nSpain, on Mr. Adams, you may safely assure the purchasers that they\r\nwill be paid.\r\n\r\nAn important matter detains Mr. Barclay some days longer, and his\r\njourney to Madrid will be circuitous. Perhaps he may arrive there a\r\nmonth later than Lambe. It would be well if the Emperor of Morocco\r\ncould, in the meantime, know that such a person is on the road. Perhaps\r\nyou may have an opportunity of notifying this to him officially, by\r\nasking from him passports for Mr. Barclay and his suite. This would be\r\neffecting two good purposes at once, if you can find an opportunity.\r\n\r\nYour letter of September the 2d, did not get to my hands till these\r\narrangements were all taken between Mr. Adams and myself, and the\r\npersons appointed. That gave me the first hint that you would have\r\nacted in this business. I mean no flattery when I assure you, that no\r\nperson would have better answered my wishes. At the same time, I doubt\r\nwhether Mr. Adams and myself should have thought ourselves justifiable\r\nin withdrawing a servant of the United States from a post equally\r\nimportant with those which prevented our acting personally in the same\r\nbusiness. I am sure, that, remaining where you are, you will be able to\r\nforward much the business, and that you will do it with a zeal you have\r\nhitherto manifested on every occasion.\r\n\r\nYour intercourse with America being less frequent than ours, from this\r\nplace, I will state to you, generally, such new occurrences there,\r\nas may be interesting; some of which, perhaps, you will not have been\r\ninformed of. It was doubtful, at the date of my last letters, whether\r\nCongress would adjourn this summer. They were too thin, however, to\r\nundertake important business. They had begun arrangements for the\r\nestablishment of a mint. The Dollar was decided on as the money Unit\r\nof America. I believe, they proposed to have gold, silver and copper\r\ncoins, descending and ascending decimally; viz., a gold coin of ten\r\ndollars, a silver coin of one-tenth of a dollar (equal to a Spanish\r\nbit), and a copper coin of one-hundredth of a dollar. These parts of\r\nthe plan, however, were not ultimately decided on. They have adopted\r\nthe late improvement in the British post office, of sending their mails\r\nby the stages. I am told, this is done from New Hampshire to Georgia,\r\nand from New York to Albany. Their treasury is administered by a board,\r\nof which Mr. Walter Livingston, Mr. Osgood, and Dr. Arthur Lee, are\r\nmembers. Governor Rutledge, who had been appointed minister to the\r\nHague, on the refusal of Governor Livingston, declines coming. We are\r\nuncertain whether the States will generally come into the proposition\r\nof investing Congress with the regulation of their commerce.\r\nMassachusetts has passed an act, the first object of which seemed to\r\nbe, to retaliate on the British commercial measures, but in the close\r\nof it, they impose double duties on all goods imported in bottoms not\r\nwholly owned by citizens of our States. New Hampshire has followed\r\nthe example. This is much complained of here, and will probably draw\r\nretaliating measures from the States of Europe, if generally adopted\r\nin America, or not corrected by the States which have adopted it. It\r\nmust be our endeavor to keep them quiet on this side the water, under\r\nthe hope that our countrymen will correct this step; as I trust they\r\nwill do. It is no ways akin to their general system. I am trying here\r\nto get contracts for the supplying the cities of France with whale\r\noil, by the Boston merchants. It would be the greatest relief possible\r\nto that State, whose commerce is in agonies, in consequence of being\r\nsubjected to alien duties on their oil, in Great Britain, which has\r\nbeen heretofore their only market. Can anything be done, in this way,\r\nin Spain? Or do they there light their streets in the night?\r\n\r\nA fracas, which has lately happened in Boston, becoming a serious\r\nmatter, I will give you the details of it, as transmitted to Mr. Adams\r\nin depositions. A Captain Stanhope, commanding the frigate Mercury,\r\nwas sent with a convoy of vessels from Nova Scotia to Boston, to get a\r\nsupply of provisions for that colony. It had happened, that two persons\r\nliving near Boston, of the names of Dunbar and Lowthorp, had been taken\r\nprisoners during the war, and transferred from one vessel to another,\r\ntill they were placed on board Stanhope's ship. He treated them most\r\ncruelly, whipping them frequently, in order to make them do duty\r\nagainst their country, as sailors, on board his ship. The ship going\r\nto Antigua to refit, he put all his prisoners into jail, first giving\r\nDunbar twenty-four lashes. Peace took place, and the prisoners got home\r\nunder the general liberation. These men were quietly pursuing their\r\noccupations at home, when they heard that Stanhope was in Boston. Their\r\nindignation was kindled. They immediately went there, and, meeting\r\nStanhope walking in the mall, Dunbar stepped up to him, and asked him\r\nif he recollected him, and the whipping him on board his ship. Having\r\nno weapon in his hand, he struck at Stanhope with his fist. Stanhope\r\nstepped back and drew his sword. The people interposed, and guarded\r\nhim to the door of a Mr. Morton, to which he retreated. There, Dunbar\r\nagain attempted to seize him; but the high sheriff had by this time\r\narrived, who interposed and protected him. The assailants withdrew,\r\nand here ended all appearance of force. But Captain Stanhope thought\r\nproper to write to the Governor, which brought on the correspondence\r\npublished in the papers of Europe. Lest you should not have seen it, I\r\nenclose it, as cut from a London paper; though not perfectly exact, it\r\nis substantially so. You will doubtless judge, that Governor Bowdoin\r\nreferred him properly to the laws for redress, as he was obliged to\r\ndo, and as would have been done in England, in a like case. Had he\r\napplied to the courts, the question would have been, whether they would\r\nhave punished Dunbar? This must be answered now by conjecture only;\r\nand, to form that conjecture, every man must ask himself whether he\r\nwould not have done as Dunbar did? And whether the people should not\r\nhave permitted him to return to Stanhope the twenty-four lashes? This\r\naffair has been stated in the London papers, without mixing with it one\r\ncircumstance of truth.\r\n\r\nIn your letter of the 27th of June, you were so good as to tell me,\r\nthat you should shortly send off some of the books I had taken the\r\nliberty to ask you to get for me, and that your correspondent at\r\nBayonne, would give me notice of their arrival there. Not having heard\r\nfrom him, I mention it to you, lest they should be stopped anywhere.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD O'BRYAN.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, November 4, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I wrote you a short letter on the 29th of September,\r\nacknowledging the receipt of yours of August the 24th, from Algiers,\r\nand promising that you should hear further from me soon. Mr. Adams,\r\nthe American minister at London, and myself, have agreed to authorize\r\nthe bearer hereof, Mr. Lambe, to treat for your redemption, and that of\r\nyour companions taken in American vessels, and, if it can be obtained\r\nfor sums within our power, we shall have the money paid. But in this,\r\nwe act without instruction from Congress, and are therefore obliged\r\nto take the precaution of requiring, that you bind your owners for\r\nyourself and crew, and the other captain, in like manner, his owners\r\nfor himself and crew, and that each person, separately, make himself\r\nanswerable for his own redemption, in case Congress requires it. I\r\nsuppose Congress will not require it; but we have no authority to\r\ndecide that, but must leave it to their own decision; which renders\r\nnecessary the precautions I have mentioned, in order to justify\r\nourselves for undertaking to redeem you, without orders. Mr. Lambe is\r\ninstructed to make no bargain without your approbation, and that of the\r\nother prisoners, each for himself. We also direct him to relieve your\r\npresent necessities. I sincerely wish you a speedy deliverance from\r\nyour distresses, and a happy return to your family.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. W. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, November 12, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received the honor of your letter of the 25th ult., written\r\nby desire of the associated company of Irish merchants, in London, and\r\nreturn you thanks for the kind congratulations you express therein. The\r\nfreedom of commerce between Ireland and America is undoubtedly very\r\ninteresting to both countries. If fair play be given to the natural\r\nadvantages of Ireland, she must come in for a distinguished share of\r\nthat commerce. She is entitled to it, from the excellence of some of\r\nher manufactures, the cheapness of most of them, their correspondence\r\nwith the American taste, a sameness of language, laws and manners, a\r\nreciprocal affection between the people, and the singular circumstance\r\nof her being the nearest European land to the United States. I am not\r\nat present so well acquainted with the trammels of Irish commerce, as\r\nto know what they are, particularly, which obstruct the intercourse\r\nbetween Ireland and America; nor, therefore, what can be the object of\r\na fleet stationed in the western ocean, to intercept that intercourse.\r\nExperience, however, has taught us to infer that the fact is probable,\r\nbecause it is impolitic. On the supposition that this interruption\r\nwill take place, you suggest Ostend as a convenient entrepôt for the\r\ncommerce between America and Ireland. Here, too, I find myself, on\r\naccount of the same ignorance of your commercial regulations, at a\r\nloss to say why this is preferable to L'Orient, which, you know, is a\r\nfree port and in great latitude, which is nearer to both parties, and\r\naccessible by a less dangerous navigation. I make no doubt, however,\r\nthat the reasons of the preference are good. You find by this essay,\r\nthat I am not likely to be a very instructive correspondent; you shall\r\nfind me, however, zealous in whatever may concern the interests of the\r\ntwo countries. The system, into which the United States wished to go,\r\nwas that of freeing commerce from every shackle. A contrary conduct\r\nin Great Britain will occasion them to adopt the contrary system, at\r\nleast as to that island. I am sure they would be glad, if it should be\r\nfound practicable, to make that discrimination between Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, which their commercial principles, and their affection for\r\nthe latter, would dictate.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect for yourself and the\r\ncompany for whom you write, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, November 14, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of troubling your Excellency on behalf of six\r\ncitizens of the United States, who have been, for some time, confined\r\nin the prison of St. Pol de Leon, and of referring for particulars,\r\nto the enclosed state of their case. Some of the material facts,\r\ntherein mentioned, are founded on the bill of sale for the vessel,\r\nher clearance from Baltimore, and her log book. The originals of the\r\ntwo last, and a copy of the first, are in my hands. I have, also,\r\nletters from a merchant in Liverpool to Asquith, which render it\r\nreally probable that his vessel was bound to Liverpool. The other\r\ncircumstances depend on their affirmation, but I must say, that in\r\nthese facts, they have been uniform and steady. I have thus long\r\navoided troubling your Excellency with this case, in hopes it would\r\nreceive its decision, in the ordinary course of law, and I relied, that\r\nthat would indemnify the sufferers, if they had been used unjustly; but\r\nthough they have been in close confinement, now near three months, it\r\nhas yet no appearance of approaching to decision. In the meantime, the\r\ncold of the winter is coming on, and, to men in their situation, may\r\nproduce events which would render all indemnification too late. I must,\r\ntherefore, pray the assistance of your Excellency, for the liberation\r\nof their persons, if the established order of things may possibly admit\r\nof it. As to their property, and their personal sufferings hitherto,\r\nI have full confidence that the laws have provided some tribunal,\r\nwhere justice will be done them. I enclose the opinion of an advocate,\r\nforwarded to me by a gentleman whom I had desired to obtain, from\r\nsome judicious person of that faculty, a state of their case. This may\r\nperhaps give a better idea than I can, of the situation of their cause.\r\nHis inquiries have led him to believe they are innocent men, but that\r\nthey must lose their vessel under the edict, which forbids those under\r\nthirty tons to approach the coast. Admitting their innocence, as he\r\ndoes, I should suppose them not the objects, on whom such an edict was\r\nmeant to operate. The essential papers, which he says they re-demanded\r\nfrom him, and did not return, were sent to me, at my desire.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of the highest respect, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The case of Lister Asquith, owner of the schooner William\r\n     and Catharine, William M'Neil, captain, William Thomson,\r\n     William Neily, Robert Anderson, mariners, and William Fowler,\r\n     passenger._\r\n\r\nLister Asquith, citizen of the State of Maryland, having a law-suit\r\ndepending in England, which required his presence, as involving in its\r\nissue nearly his whole fortune, determined to go thither in a small\r\nschooner of his own, that he might, at the same time, take with him an\r\nadventure of tobacco and flour to Liverpool, where he had commercial\r\nconnections. This schooner he purchased as of fifty-nine and a quarter\r\ntons, as appears by his bill of sale, but she had been registered by\r\nher owner at twenty-one tons, in order to evade the double duties\r\nin England, to which American vessels are now subject. He cleared\r\nout from Baltimore for Liverpool, the 11th of June, 1785, with eight\r\nhogsheads of tobacco and sixty barrels of flour, but ran aground at\r\nSmith's point, sprung a leak, and was obliged to return to Baltimore\r\nto refit. Having stopped his leak, he took his cargo on board again,\r\nand his health being infirm, he engaged Captain William M'Neil[115] to\r\ngo with him, and, on the 20th of June, sailed for Norfolk in Virginia,\r\nand, on the 22d, came to in Hampton road, at the mouth of the river on\r\nwhich Norfolk is. Learning here that tobacco would be better than flour\r\nfor the English market, he landed fifty barrels of his flour and one\r\nhogshead of tobacco, which he found to be bad, meaning to take, instead\r\nthereof, nine hogsheads of tobacco more. But the same night it began to\r\nblow very hard, with much rain. The 23d, the storm became more heavy;\r\nthey let go both their anchors, but were driven, notwithstanding, from\r\ntheir anchorage, forced to put to sea and to go before the wind. The\r\noccurrences of their voyage will be best detailed by short extracts\r\nfrom the log-book.\r\n\r\n     _June 24._ The weather becomes worse. One of the fore shrouds\r\n     and the foremast carried away.\r\n\r\n     _June 25._ Shifted their ballast which threw them on their\r\n     beam ends, and shipped a very heavy sea. Held a consultation,\r\n     the result of which was, that seeing they were now driven so\r\n     far to sea, and the weather continuing still very bad, it was\r\n     better to steer for Liverpool, their port of destination,\r\n     though they had not their cargo on board, and no other\r\n     clearance but that which they took from Baltimore.\r\n\r\n     _June 29._ The first observation they had been able to take\r\n     N. lat. 38° 13´.\r\n\r\n     _June 30._ Winds begin to be light, but the sea still very\r\n     heavy.\r\n\r\n     _July 5._ Light winds and a smooth sea for the first time, in\r\n     lat. 43° 12´.\r\n\r\n     _July 9._ Spoke a French brig, Comte d'Artois, Captain\r\n     Mieaux, from St. Maloes, in distress for provisions. Relieved\r\n     her with three barrels of flour.\r\n\r\n     _Aug. 6._ Thick weather and a strong wind. Made the Lands'\r\n     End of England.\r\n\r\n     _Aug. 7._ Unable to fetch the land, therefore bore\r\n     off for Scilly, and came to with both anchors. Drove,\r\n     notwithstanding, and obliged to get up the anchors, and put\r\n     to sea, running southwardly.\r\n\r\n     _Aug. 8._ Made the land of France, but did not know what\r\n     part.\r\n\r\nHere the logbook ends. At this time they had on board but ten gallons\r\nof water, four or five barrels of bread, two or three pounds of\r\ncandles, no firewood. Their sails unfit to be trusted to any longer,\r\nand all their materials for mending them exhausted by the constant\r\nrepairs which the violence of the weather had called for. They\r\ntherefore took a pilot aboard, who carried them into Pont Duval; but\r\nbeing informed by the captain of a vessel there that the schooner was\r\ntoo sharp built (as the American vessels mostly are) to lie in that\r\nport, they put out immediately, and the next morning the pilot brought\r\nthem to anchor in the road of the Isle de Bas. Asquith went immediately\r\nto Roscaff, protested at the admiralty the true state of his case, and\r\nreported his vessel and cargo at the custom-house. In making the report\r\nof his vessel, he stated her as of twenty-one tons, according to his\r\nregister. The officer informed him that if she was no larger, she would\r\nbe confiscated by an edict, which forbids all vessels under thirty tons\r\nto approach the coast. He told the officer what was the real truth\r\nas to his register and his bill of sale, and was permitted to report\r\nher according to the latter. He paid the usual fees of ten livres and\r\nseven sols, and obtained a clearance. Notwithstanding this, he was soon\r\nvisited by other persons whom he supposes to have been commis of the\r\nFermes, who seized his vessel, carried her to the pier, and confined\r\nthe crew to the vessel and half the pier, putting sentinels over them.\r\nThey brought a guager, who measured only her hold and part of her\r\nsteerage, allowing nothing for the cockpit, cabin, forecastle, and\r\nabove one-half of the steerage, which is almost half the vessel, and\r\nthus made her contents (if that had been of any importance) much below\r\nthe truth. The tobacco was weighed, and found to be six thousand four\r\nhundred and eighty-seven pounds,[116] which was sent on the 18th to\r\nLandivisian, and on the 19th they were committed to close prison at St.\r\nPol de Leon, where they have been confined ever since. They had, when\r\nthey first landed, some money, of which they were soon disembarrassed\r\nby different persons, who, in various forms, undertook to serve them.\r\nUnable to speak or understand a word of the language of the country,\r\nfriendless, and left without money, they have languished three months\r\nin a loathsome jail, without any other sustenance, a great part of the\r\ntime, than what could be procured for three sous a day, which have been\r\nfurnished them to prevent their perishing.\r\n\r\nThey have been made to understand that a criminal process is going on\r\nagainst them under two heads. 1. As having sold tobacco in contraband;\r\nand 2, as having entered a port of France in a vessel of less than\r\nthirty tons burthen. In support of the first charge, they understand\r\nthat the circumstance is relied on, of their having been seen off the\r\ncoast by the employés des Fermes one or two days. They acknowledge they\r\nmay have been so seen while beating off Pont Duval till they could get\r\na pilot while entering that port, and again going round from thence to\r\nthe road of the Isle de Bas. The reasons for this have been explained.\r\nThey further add, that all the time they were at Pont Duval they had\r\na King's officer on board, from whom, as well as from their pilot and\r\nthe captain, by whose advice they left that port for the Isle de Bas,\r\ninformation can be obtained by their accusers (who are not imprisoned),\r\nof the true motives for that measure. It is said to be urged also, that\r\nthere was found in their vessel some loose tobacco in a blanket, which\r\nexcites a suspicion that they had been selling tobacco. When they were\r\nstowing their loading, they broke a hogshead, as is always necessary,\r\nand is always done, to fill up the stowage, and to consolidate and\r\nkeep the whole mass firm, and in place. The loose tobacco which had\r\ncome out of the broken hogshead, they repacked in bags; but in the\r\ncourse of the distress of their disastrous voyage, they had employed\r\nthese bags, as they had done everything else of the same nature, in\r\nmending their sails. The condition of their sails, when they came into\r\nport, will prove this, and they were seen by witnesses enough, to whom\r\ntheir accusers, being at their liberty, can have access. Besides, the\r\nsale of a part of their tobacco is a fact which, had it taken place,\r\nmight have been proved; but they deny that it has been proved, or\r\never can be proved by true men, because it never existed. And they\r\nhope the justice of this country does not permit strangers, seeking in\r\nher ports an asylum from death, to be thrown into jail and continued\r\nthere indefinitely, on the possibility of a fact, without any proof.\r\nMore especially when, as in the present case, a demonstration to the\r\ncontrary is furnished by their clearance, which shows they never had\r\nmore than eight hogsheads of tobacco on board, of which one had been\r\nput ashore at Hampton in Virginia, as has been before related, and\r\nthe seven others remained when they first entered port. If they had\r\nbeen smugglers of tobacco, the opposite coast offered a much fairer\r\nfield, because the gain there is as great; because they understand the\r\nlanguage and laws of the country, they know its harbors and coasts,\r\nand have connections in them. These circumstances are so important to\r\nsmugglers, that it is believed no instance has ever occurred of the\r\ncontraband of tobacco, attempted on this side the channel by a crew\r\nwholly American. Be this as it may, they are not of that description of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAs to the second charge, that they have entered a port of France in\r\na vessel of less than thirty tons burthen, they, in the first place,\r\nobserve that they saw the guager measure the vessel, and affirm that\r\nhis method of measuring could render little more than half her true\r\ncontents; but they say, further, that were she below the size of thirty\r\ntons, and, when entering the port, had they known of the alternative\r\nof either forfeiting their vessel and cargo, or of perishing at sea,\r\nthey must still have entered the port: the loss of their vessel and\r\ncargo being the lesser evil. But the character of the lawgiver assures\r\nthem, that the intention of his laws are perverted when misapplied to\r\npersons who, under their circumstances, take refuge in his ports. They\r\nhave no occasion to recur from his clemency to his justice, by claiming\r\nthe benefit of that article in the treaty which binds the two nations\r\ntogether, and which assures to the fugitives of either from the dangers\r\nof the sea, a hospitable reception and necessary aids in the ports of\r\nthe other, and that without measuring the size of their vessel.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, they protest themselves to have been as innocent as\r\nthey have been unfortunate. Instead of relief in a friendly port, they\r\nhave seen their misfortunes aggravated by the conduct of officers,\r\nwho, in their greediness for gain, can see in no circumstance anything\r\nbut proofs of guilt. They have already long suffered, and are still\r\nsuffering, whatever scanty sustenance an inclement season and close\r\nconfinement can offer most distressing to men who have been used to\r\nneither, and who have wives and children at home participating of\r\ntheir distresses; they are utterly ignorant of the laws and language\r\nof the country where they are suffering; they are deprived of that\r\nproperty which would have enabled them to procure counsel to place\r\ntheir injuries in a true light; they are distant from the stations of\r\nthose who are appointed by their country to patronize their rights;\r\nthey are not at liberty to go to them, nor able to have communication\r\nthrough any other than the uncertain medium of the posts; and they see\r\nthemselves already ruined by the losses and delays they have been made\r\nto incur, and by the failure of the original object of their voyage.\r\nThey throw themselves, therefore, on the patronage of the government,\r\nand pray that its energies may be interposed in aid of their poverty\r\nand ignorance, to restore them to their liberty, and to extend to them\r\nthat retribution which the laws of every country mean to extend to\r\nthose who suffer unjustly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, November 19, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote to you, on the 11th of October, by Mr. Preston,\r\nand again on the 18th of the same month, by post. Since that, yours of\r\nSeptember the 25th, by Mr. Boylston, of October the 24th, November the\r\n1st, and November the 4th, have come safe to hand. I will take up their\r\nseveral subjects in order. Boylston's object was, first, to dispose\r\nof a cargo of spermaceti oil, which he brought to Havre. A secondary\r\none, was to obtain a contract for future supplies. I carried him to\r\nthe Marquis de La Fayette. As to his first object, we are in hopes of\r\ngetting the duties taken off, which will enable him to sell his cargo.\r\nThis has led to discussions with the ministers, which give us a hope\r\nthat we may get the duties taken off _in perpetuum_. This done, a\r\nmost abundant market for our oil will be opened by this country, and\r\none which will be absolutely dependent on us; for they have little\r\nexpectation themselves of establishing a successful whale fishery. It\r\nis possible they may only take the duties off of those oils, which\r\nshall be the produce of associated companies of French and American\r\nmerchants. But, as yet, nothing certain can be said.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the trouble you have taken to obtain insurance on\r\nHoudon's life. I place the thirty-two pounds and eleven shillings to\r\nyour credit, and not being able, as yet, to determine precisely how\r\nour account stands, I send a sum by Colonel Smith, which may draw the\r\nscales towards a balance.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the British cabinet to make no equal treaty with\r\nus, confirms me in the opinion expressed in your letter of October\r\nthe 24th, that the United States must pass a navigation act against\r\nGreat Britain, and load her manufactures with duties, so as to give\r\na preference to those of other countries; and I hope our Assemblies\r\nwill wait no longer, but transfer such a power to Congress, at the\r\nsessions of this fall. I suppose, however, it will only be against\r\nGreat Britain, and I think it will be right not to involve other\r\nnations in the consequences of her injustice. I take for granted,\r\nthat the commercial system, wished for by Congress, was such a one\r\nas should leave commerce on the freest footing possible. This was\r\nthe plan on which we prepared our general draught for treating with\r\nall nations. Of those with whom we were to treat, I ever considered\r\nEngland, France, Spain, and Portugal as capitally important; the\r\nfirst two, on account of their American possessions, the last, for\r\ntheir European as well as American. Spain is treating in America, and\r\nprobably will give an advantageous treaty. Portugal shows dispositions\r\nto do the same. France does not treat. It is likely enough she will\r\nchoose to keep the staff in her own hands. But, in the meantime,\r\nshe gives us an access to her West Indies, which, though not all we\r\nwish, is yet extremely valuable to us; this access, indeed, is much\r\naffected by the late _Arrets_ of the 18th and 25th of September, which\r\nI enclose to you. I consider these as a reprisal for the navigation\r\nacts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The minister has complained\r\nto me, officially, of these acts, as a departure from the reciprocity\r\nstipulated for by the treaty. I have assured him that his complaints\r\nshall be communicated to Congress, and, in the meantime, observed that\r\nthe example of discriminating between foreigners and natives had been\r\nset by the _Arret_ of August, 1784, and still more remarkably by those\r\nof September the 18th and 25th, which, in effect, are a prohibition\r\nof our fish in their islands. However, it is better for us that both\r\nsides should revise what they have done. I am in hopes this country\r\ndid not mean these as permanent regulations. Mr. Bingham, lately from\r\nHolland, tells me that the Dutch are much dissatisfied with these acts.\r\nIn fact, I expect the European nations in general, will rise up against\r\nan attempt of this kind, and wage a general commercial war against\r\nus. They can do well without all our commodities, except tobacco, and\r\nwe cannot find elsewhere markets for them. The selfishness of England\r\nalone will not justify our hazarding a contest of this kind against\r\nall Europe. Spain, Portugal, and France, have not yet shut their\r\ndoors against us; it will be time enough when they do to take up the\r\ncommercial hatchet. I hope, therefore, those States will repeal their\r\nnavigation clauses, except as against Great Britain and other nations\r\nnot treating with us.\r\n\r\nI have made the inquiries you desire as to American ship-timber for\r\nthis country. You know they sent some person (whose name was not told\r\nus) to America, to examine the quality of our masts, spars, &c. I think\r\nthis was young Chaumont's business. They have, besides this, instructed\r\nthe officer who superintends their supplies of masts, spars, &c., to\r\nprocure good quantities from our northern States; but I think they\r\nhave made no contract; on the contrary, that they await the trials\r\nprojected, but with a determination to look to us for considerable\r\nsupplies, if they find our timber answer. They have on the carpet a\r\ncontract for live oak from the southern States.\r\n\r\nYou ask why the Virginian merchants do not learn to sort their own\r\ntobaccos? They can sort them as well as any other merchants whatever.\r\nNothing is better known than the quality of every hogshead of tobacco,\r\nfrom the place of its growth. They know, too, the particular qualities\r\nrequired in every market. They do not send their tobaccos, therefore,\r\nto London to be sorted, but to pay their debts; and though they could\r\nsend them to other markets, and remit the money to London, yet they\r\nfind it necessary to give their English merchant the benefit of the\r\nconsignment of their tobacco (which is enormously gainful), in order to\r\ninduce him to continue his indulgence for the balance due.\r\n\r\nIs it impossible to persuade our countrymen to make peace with the Nova\r\nScotians? I am persuaded nothing is wanting but advances on our part;\r\nand that it is in our power to draw off the greatest proportion of that\r\nsettlement, and thus to free ourselves from rivals who may become of\r\nconsequence. We are at present co-operating with Great Britain, whose\r\npolicy it is to give aliment to that bitter enmity between her States\r\nand ours, which may secure her against their ever joining us. But would\r\nnot the existence of a cordial friendship between us and them, be the\r\nbest bridle we could possibly put into the mouth of England?\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Danish business, you will observe that the\r\ninstructions of Congress, article 3, of October the 29th, 1783, put\r\nit entirely into the hands of the _Ministers Plenipotentiary of the\r\nUnited States of America at the court of Versailles, empowered to\r\nnegotiate a peace, or to any one or more of them_. At that time, I\r\ndid not come under this description. I had received the permission of\r\nCongress to decline coming in the spring preceding that date. On the\r\nfirst day of November, 1783, that is to say, two days after the date\r\nof the instructions to the commissioners, Congress recommended John\r\nPaul Jones to the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at\r\nVersailles as agent, to solicit, under his direction, the payment of\r\nall prizes taken in Europe, under his command. But the object under\r\ntheir view, at that time, was assuredly the money due from the court\r\nof Versailles, for the prizes taken in the expedition by the Bon\r\nhomme Richard, the Alliance, &c. In this business, I have aided him\r\neffectually, having obtained a definitive order for paying the money to\r\nhim, and a considerable proportion being actually paid him. But they\r\ncould not mean by their resolution of November the 1st, to take from\r\nthe commissioners powers which they had given them two days before.\r\nIf there could remain a doubt that this whole power has resulted to\r\nyou, it would be cleared up by the instructions of May the 7th, 1784,\r\narticle 9, which declare, \"that these instructions be considered as\r\nsupplementary to those of October the 29th, 1783, and not as revoking,\r\nexcept where they contradict them;\" which shows that they considered\r\nthe instructions of October the 29th, 1783, as still in full force.\r\nI do not give you the trouble of this discussion, to save myself the\r\ntrouble of the negotiation. I should have no objections to this part;\r\nbut it is to avoid the impropriety of meddling in a matter wherein I am\r\nunauthorized to act, and where anything I should pretend to conclude\r\nwith the court of Denmark might have the appearance of a deception on\r\nthem. Should it be in my power to render any service in it, I shall\r\ndo it with cheerfulness; but I repeat, that I think you are the only\r\nperson authorized.\r\n\r\nI received, a few days ago, the Nuova minuta of Tuscany, which Colonel\r\nHumphreys will deliver you. I have been so engaged, that I have not\r\nbeen able to go over it with any attention. I observe, in general,\r\nthat the order of the articles is entirely deranged, and their diction\r\nalmost totally changed. When you shall have examined it, if you will\r\nbe so good as to send me your observations by post, in cypher, I will\r\ncommunicate with you in the same way, and try to mature this matter.\r\n\r\nThe deaths of the Dukes of Orleans and Praslin will probably reach you\r\nthrough the channel of the public papers, before this letter does. Your\r\nfriends the Abbés are well, and always speak of you with affection.\r\nColonel Humphreys comes to pass some time in London. My curiosity\r\nwould render a short trip thither agreeable to me also, but I see no\r\nprobability of taking it. I will trouble you with my respects to Dr.\r\nPrice. Those to Mrs. Adams, I witness in a letter to herself.\r\n\r\nI am, with very great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, November 20, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I found here, on my return from Fontainebleau, the letter of\r\nOctober the 30th, which your Excellency did me the honor there, of\r\ninforming me had been addressed to me at this place; and I shall avail\r\nmyself of the first occasion of transmitting it to Congress, who will\r\nreceive, with great pleasure, these new assurances of the friendly\r\nsentiments which his Majesty is pleased to continue towards the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI am equally persuaded they will pay the most serious attention to\r\nthat part of your Excellency's letter, which mentions the information\r\nyou have received of certain acts or regulations of navigation and\r\ncommerce, passed in some of the United States, which are injurious\r\nto the commerce of France. In the meantime, I wish to remove the\r\nunfavorable impressions which those acts seem to have made, as if\r\nthey were a departure from the reciprocity of conduct, stipulated for\r\nby the treaty of February the 6th, 1776. The effect of that treaty\r\nis, to place each party with the other always on the footing of the\r\nmost favored nation. But those, who framed the acts, probably did not\r\nconsider the treaty as restraining either from discriminating between\r\nforeigners and natives. Yet this is the sole effect of these acts.\r\nThe same opinion as to the meaning of the treaty seems to have been\r\nentertained by this government, both before and since the date of\r\nthese acts. For the _Arret_ of the King's Council, of August the 30th,\r\n1784, furnished an example of such a discrimination between foreigners\r\nand natives, importing salted fish into his Majesty's dominions in\r\nthe West Indies; by laying a duty on that imported by foreigners, and\r\ngiving out the same, in bounty, to native importers. This opinion shows\r\nitself more remarkably in the late _Arrets_ of the 18th and 25th of\r\nSeptember, which, increasing to excess the duty on foreign importations\r\nof fish into the West Indies, giving the double, in bounty, on those\r\nof natives, and thereby rendering it impossible for the former to\r\nsell in competition with the latter, have, in effect, prohibited the\r\nimportation of that article by the citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nBoth nations, perhaps, may come into the opinion, that their friendship\r\nand their interests may be better cemented, by approaching the\r\ncondition of their citizens, reciprocally, to that of _natives_, as a\r\nbetter ground of intercourse than that of _the most favored nation_.\r\nI shall rest with hopes of being authorized, in due time, to inform\r\nyour Excellency that nothing will be wanting, on our part, to evince a\r\ndisposition to concur in revising whatever regulations may, on either\r\nside, bear hard on the commerce of the other nation. In the meantime,\r\nI have the honor to assure you of the profound respect and esteem with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, November 27, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 5th came to hand yesterday, and Colonel\r\nSmith, and Colonel Humphreys (by whom you will receive one of the\r\n19th, from me) being to set out to-morrow, I hasten to answer it. I\r\nsincerely rejoice that Portugal is stepping forward in the business\r\nof treaty, and that there is a probability that we may at length do\r\nsomething under our commissions, which may produce a solid benefit to\r\nour constituents. I as much rejoice, that it is not to be negotiated\r\nthrough the medium of the torpid, uninformed machine, at first made\r\nuse of. I conjecture, from your relation of the conference with the\r\nChevalier de Pinto, that he is well informed and sensible. So much the\r\nbetter. It is one of those cases, where the better the interest of the\r\ntwo parties are understood, the broader will be the basis on which they\r\nwill connect them.\r\n\r\nTo the very judicious observations on the subjects of the conference,\r\nwhich were made by you, I have little to add.\r\n\r\n_Flour._ It may be observed, that we can sell them the flour ready\r\nmanufactured for much less than the wheat of which it is made. In\r\ncarrying to them wheat, we carry also the bran, which does not pay its\r\nown freight. In attempting to save and transport wheat to them, much is\r\nlost by the weavil, and much spoiled by heat in the hold of the vessel.\r\nThis loss must be laid on the wheat which gets safe to market, where\r\nit is paid for by the consumer. Now, this is much more than the cost of\r\nmanufacturing it with us, which would prevent that loss. I suppose the\r\ncost of manufacturing does not exceed seven per cent. on the value. But\r\nthe loss by the weavil, and other damage on shipboard, amount to much\r\nmore. Let them buy of us as much wheat as will make a hundred weight\r\nof flour. They will find that they have paid more for the wheat than we\r\nshould have asked for the flour, besides having lost the labor of their\r\nmills in grinding it. The obliging us, therefore, to carry it to them\r\nin the form of wheat, is a useless loss to both parties.\r\n\r\n_Iron._ They will get none from us. We cannot make it in competition\r\nwith Sweden, or any other nation of Europe, where labor is so much\r\ncheaper.\r\n\r\n_Wines._ The strength of the wines of Portugal will give them always\r\nan almost exclusive possession of a country, where the summers are\r\nso hot as in America. The present demand will be very great, if they\r\nwill enable us to pay for them; but if they consider the extent and\r\nrapid population of the United States, they must see that the time\r\nis not distant, when they will not be able to make enough for us, and\r\nthat it is of great importance to avail themselves of the prejudices\r\nalready established in favor of their wines, and to continue them by\r\nfacilitating the purchase. Let them do this, and they need not care for\r\nthe decline of their use in England. They will be independent of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_Salt._ I do not know where the northern States supplied themselves\r\nwith salt, but the southern ones took great quantities from Portugal.\r\n\r\n_Cotton_ and _Wool_. The southern States will take manufactures of\r\nboth: the northern will take both the manufactures and raw materials.\r\n\r\n_East India goods of every kind._ Philadelphia and New York have begun\r\ntrade to the East Indies. Perhaps Boston may follow their example. But\r\ntheir importations will be sold only to the country adjacent to them.\r\nFor a long time to come, the States south of the Delaware will not\r\nengage in a direct commerce with the East Indies. They neither have,\r\nnor will have ships or seamen for their other commerce: nor will they\r\nbuy East India goods of the northern States. Experience shows that the\r\nStates never bought foreign good of one another. The reasons are, that\r\nthey would, in so doing, pay double freight and charges; and again,\r\nthat they would have to pay mostly in cash, what they could obtain for\r\ncommodities in Europe. I know that the American merchants have looked,\r\nwith some anxiety, to the arrangements to be taken with Portugal, in\r\nexpectation that they could, through her, get their East India articles\r\non better and more convenient terms; and I am of opinion, Portugal will\r\ncome in for a good share of this traffic with the southern States, if\r\nthey facilitate our payments.\r\n\r\n_Coffee._ Can they not furnish us with this article from Brazil?\r\n\r\n_Sugar._ The Brazil sugars are esteemed, with us, more than any other.\r\n\r\n_Chocolate._ This article, when ready made, as also the cocoa, becomes\r\nso soon rancid, and the difficulties of getting in fresh have been\r\nso great in America, that its use has spread but little. The way to\r\nincrease its consumption would be, to permit it to be brought to us\r\nimmediately from the country of its growth. By getting it good in\r\nquality, and cheap in price, the superiority of the article, both for\r\nhealth and nourishment, will soon give it the same preference over tea\r\nand coffee in America, which it has in Spain, where they can get it\r\nby a single voyage, and, of course, while it is sweet. The use of the\r\nsugars, coffee, and cotton of Brazil, would also be much extended by a\r\nsimilar indulgence.\r\n\r\nGinger and spices from the Brazils, if they had the advantage of a\r\ndirect transportation, might take place of the same articles from the\r\nEast Indies.\r\n\r\n_Ginseng._ We can furnish them with enough to supply their whole demand\r\nfor the East Indies.\r\n\r\nThey should be prepared to expect, that in the beginning of this\r\ncommerce, more money will be taken by us, than after awhile. The\r\nreasons are, that our heavy debt to Great Britain must be paid, before\r\nwe shall be masters of our own returns; and again, that habits of using\r\nparticular things are produced only by time and practice.\r\n\r\nThat as little time as possible may be lost in this negotiation, I will\r\ncommunicate to you, at once, my sentiments as to the alterations in the\r\ndraught sent them, which will probably be proposed by them, or which\r\nought to be proposed by us, noting only those articles.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. They will probably restrain us to their dominions in\r\nEurope. We must expressly include the Azores, Madeiras, and Cape de\r\nVerd islands, some of which are deemed to be in Africa. We should also\r\ncontend for an access to their possessions in America, according to the\r\ngradation in the 2d article of our instructions of May the 7th, 1784.\r\nBut if we can obtain it in no one of these forms, I am of opinion we\r\nshould give it up.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. This should be put into the form we gave it, in the draught\r\nsent you by Dr. Franklin and myself, for Great Britain. I think we had\r\nnot reformed this article, when we sent our draught to Portugal. You\r\nknow the Confederation renders the reformation absolutely necessary; a\r\ncircumstance which had escaped us at first.\r\n\r\nArticle 9. Add, from the British draught, the clause about wrecks.\r\n\r\nArticle 13. The passage \"nevertheless,\" &c., to run as in the British\r\ndraught.\r\n\r\nArticle 18. After the word \"accident,\" insert \"or wanting supplies\r\nof provisions or other refreshments.\" And again, instead of \"take\r\nrefuge,\" insert \"come,\" and after \"of the other\" insert \"in any part\r\nof the world.\" The object of this is to obtain leave for our whaling\r\nvessels to refit and refresh on the coast of the Brazils; an object\r\nof immense importance to that class of our vessels. We must acquiesce\r\nunder such modifications as they may think necessary, for regulating\r\nthis indulgence, in hopes to lessen them in time, and to get a _pied a\r\nterre_ in that country.\r\n\r\nArticle 19. Can we get this extended to the Brazils? It would be\r\nprecious in case of a war with Spain.\r\n\r\nArticle 23. Between \"places\" and \"whose,\" insert \"and in general, all\r\nothers,\" as in the British draught.\r\n\r\nArticle 24. For \"necessaries,\" substitute \"comforts.\"\r\n\r\nArticle 25. Add \"but if any such consuls shall exercise commerce,\" &c.,\r\nas in the British draught.\r\n\r\nWe should give to Congress as early notice as possible of the\r\nre-institution of this negotiation; because, in a letter by a gentleman\r\nwho sailed from Havre, the 10th instant, I communicated to them the\r\nanswer of the Portuguese minister, through the ambassador here, which\r\nI sent to you. They may, in consequence, be making other arrangements\r\nwhich might do injury. The little time which now remains, of the\r\ncontinuance of our commissions, should also be used with the Chevalier\r\nde Pinto, to hasten the movements of his court.\r\n\r\nBut all these preparations for trade with Portugal will fail in their\r\neffect, unless the depredations of the Algerines can be prevented.\r\nI am far from confiding in the measures taken for this purpose. Very\r\npossibly war must be recurred to. Portugal is at war with them. Suppose\r\nthe Chevalier de Pinto was to be sounded on the subject of an union of\r\nforce, and even a stipulation for contributing, each, a certain force,\r\nto be kept in constant cruise. Such a league once begun, other nations\r\nwould drop into it, one by one. If he should seem to approve it, it\r\nmight then be suggested to Congress, who, if they should be forced to\r\ntry the measure of war, would doubtless be glad of such an ally. As the\r\nPortuguese negotiation should be hastened, I suppose our communications\r\nmust often be trusted to the post, availing ourselves of the cover of\r\nour cypher.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, December 4, 1785.\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_,--I enclose you a letter from Gatteaux, observing that\r\nthere will be an anachronism, if, in making a medal to commemorate\r\nthe victory of Saratoga, he puts on General Gates the insignia of the\r\nCincinnati, which did not exist at that date. I wrote him, in answer,\r\nthat I thought so too, but that you had the direction of the business;\r\nthat you were now in London; that I would write to you, and probably\r\nshould have an answer within a fortnight; and, that in the meantime,\r\nhe could be employed on other parts of the die. I supposed you might\r\nnot have observed, on the print of General Gates, the insignia of the\r\nCincinnati, or did not mean that that particular should be copied.\r\nAnother reason against it strikes me. Congress have studiously avoided\r\ngiving to the public their sense of this institution. Should medals be\r\nprepared, to be presented from them to certain officers, and bearing\r\non them the insignia of the order, as the presenting them would involve\r\nan approbation of the institution, a previous question would be forced\r\non them, whether they would present these medals? I am of opinion it\r\nwould be very disagreeable to them to be placed under the necessity of\r\nmaking this declaration. Be so good as to let me know your wishes on\r\nthis subject, by the first post.\r\n\r\nMr. Short has been sick ever since you left us. Nothing new has\r\noccurred here, since your departure. I imagine you have American news.\r\nIf so, pray give us some. Present me affectionately to Mr. Adams and\r\nthe ladies, and to Colonel Smith; and be assured of the esteem with\r\nwhich I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, December 10, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--On the arrival of Mr. Boylston, I carried him to the Marquis\r\nde La Fayette, who received from him communications of his object.\r\nThis was to get a remission of the duties on his cargo of oil, and he\r\nwas willing to propose a future contract. I suggested, however, to the\r\nMarquis, when we were alone, that instead of wasting our efforts on\r\nindividual applications, we had better take up the subject on general\r\nground, and whatever could be obtained, let it be common to all. He\r\nconcurred with me. As the jealousy of office between ministers does not\r\npermit me to apply immediately to the one in whose department this was,\r\nthe Marquis's agency was used. The result was, to put us on the footing\r\nof the Hanseatic towns, as to whale oil, and to reduce the duties to\r\neleven livres and five sols for five hundred and twenty pounds, French,\r\nwhich is very nearly two livres on the English hundred weight, or about\r\na guinea and a half the ton. But the oil must be brought in American\r\nor French ships, and the indulgence is limited to one year. However,\r\nas to this, I expressed to Count de Vergennes my hopes that it would\r\nbe continued; and should a doubt arise, I should propose, at the proper\r\ntime, to claim it under the treaty, on the footing _gentis amicissimæ_.\r\nAfter all, I believe Mr. Boylston has failed of selling to Sangrain,\r\nand, from what I learn, through a little too much hastiness of temper.\r\nPerhaps they may yet come together, or he may sell to somebody else.\r\n\r\nWhen the general matter was thus arranged, a Mr. Barrett arrived here\r\nfrom Boston, with letters of recommendation from Governor Bowdoin,\r\nCushing, and others. His errand was, to get the whale business here\r\nput on a general bottom, instead of the particular one, which had been\r\nsettled, you know, the last year, for a special company. We told him\r\nwhat was done. He thinks it will answer, and proposes to settle at\r\nL'Orient, for conducting the sales of the oil, and the returns. I hope,\r\ntherefore, that this matter is tolerably well fixed, as far as the\r\nconsumption of this country goes. I know not, as yet, to what amount\r\nthat is; but shall endeavor to find out how much they consume, and how\r\nmuch they furnish themselves. I propose to Mr. Barrett, that he should\r\ninduce either his State or individuals to send a sufficient number\r\nof boxes of the spermaceti candle, to give one to every leading house\r\nin Paris; I mean to those who lead the ton; and, at the same time, to\r\ndeposit a quantity for sale here, and advertise them in the _petites\r\naffiches_. I have written to Mr. Carmichael, to know on what footing\r\nthe use and introduction of the whale oil is there, or can be placed.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, December 22, 1785.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The death of the late General Oglethorpe, who had considerable\r\npossessions in Georgia, has given rise, as we understand, to questions\r\nwhether those possessions have become the property of the State, or\r\nhave been transferred by his will to his widow, or descended on the\r\nnearest heir capable in law of taking them. In the latter case, the\r\nChevalier de Mezieres, a subject of France, stands foremost, as being\r\nmade capable of the inheritance by the treaty between this country and\r\nthe United States. Under the regal government, it was the practice with\r\nus, when lands passed to the crown by escheat or forfeiture, to grant\r\nthem to such relation of the party, as stood on the fairest ground.\r\nThis was even a chartered right in some of the States. The practice has\r\nbeen continued among them, as deeming that the late Revolution should,\r\nin no instance, abridge the rights of the people. Should this have been\r\nthe practice in the State of Georgia, or should they, in any instance,\r\nthink proper to admit it, I am persuaded none will arise, in which\r\nit would be more expedient to do it, than in the present, and that no\r\nperson's expectations should be fairer than those of the Chevalier de\r\nMezieres. He is the nephew of General Oglethorpe, he is of singular\r\npersonal merit, an officer of rank, of high connections, and patronized\r\nby the ministers. His case has drawn their attention, and seems to be\r\nconsidered as protected by the treaty of alliance, and as presenting\r\na trial of our regard to that. Should these lands be considered as\r\nhaving passed to the State, I take the liberty of recommending him\r\nto the legislature of Georgia, as worthy of their generosity, and as\r\npresenting an opportunity of proving the favorable dispositions which\r\nexist throughout America, towards the subjects of this country, and an\r\nopportunity too, which will probably be known and noted here.\r\n\r\nIn the several views, therefore, of personal merit, justice, generosity\r\nand policy, I presume to recommend the Chevalier de Mezieres, and his\r\ninterests, to the notice and patronage of your Excellency, whom the\r\nchoice of your country has sufficiently marked, as possessing the\r\ndispositions, while it has, at the same time, given you the power,\r\nto befriend just claims. The Chevalier de Mezieres will pass over to\r\nGeorgia in the ensuing spring; but, should he find an opportunity,\r\nhe will probably forward this letter sooner. I have the honor to be,\r\nwith sentiments of the most profound respect, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GEORGIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, December 22, 1785.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--By my despatch to Mr. Jay, which accompanies this, you\r\nwill perceive that the claims of the Chevalier de Mezieres, nephew\r\nto the late General Oglethorpe, to his possessions within your\r\nState, have attracted the attention of the ministry here; and that,\r\nconsidering them as protected by their treaty with us, they have viewed\r\nas derogatory of that, the doubts which have been expressed on the\r\nsubject. I have thought it best to present to them those claims in the\r\nleast favorable point of view, to lessen, as much as possible, the ill\r\neffects of a disappointment; but I think it my duty to ask your notice\r\nand patronage of this case as one whose decision will have an effect on\r\nthe general interests of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier de Mezieres is nephew to General Oglethorpe; he is a\r\nperson of great estimation, powerfully related and protected. His\r\ninterests are espoused by those whom it is our interest to gratify. I\r\nwill take the liberty, therefore, of soliciting your recommendations\r\nof him to the generosity of your legislature, and to the patronage and\r\ngood offices of your friends, whose efforts, though in a private case,\r\nwill do a public good. The pecuniary advantages of confiscation, in\r\nthis instance, cannot compensate its ill effects. It is difficult to\r\nmake foreigners understand those legal distinctions between the effects\r\nof forfeiture, of escheat, and of conveyance, on which the professors\r\nof the law might build their opinions in this case. They can see only\r\nthe outlines of the case; to wit, the death of a possessor of lands\r\nlying within the United States, leaving an heir in France, and the\r\nState claiming those lands in opposition to the heir. An individual,\r\nthinking himself injured, makes more noise than a State. Perhaps, too,\r\nin every case which either party to a treaty thinks to be within its\r\nprovisions, it is better not to weigh the syllables and letters of the\r\ntreaty, but to show that gratitude and affection render that appeal\r\nunnecessary. I take the freedom, therefore, of submitting to your\r\nwisdom, the motives which present themselves in favor of a grant to the\r\nChevalier de Mezieres, and the expediency of urging them on your State,\r\nas far as you may think proper.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, December 27, 1785.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favors of the 13th and 20th, were put in my hands\r\nto-day. This will be delivered you by Mr. Dalrymple, secretary to the\r\nlegation of Mr. Crawford. I do not know whether you were acquainted\r\nwith him here. He is a young man of learning and candor, and exhibits\r\na phenomenon I never before met with, that is, a republican born on the\r\nnorth side of the Tweed.\r\n\r\nYou have been consulted in the case of the Chevalier de Mezieres,\r\nnephew to General Oglethorpe, and are understood to have given an\r\nopinion derogatory of our treaty with France. I was also consulted,\r\nand understood in the same way. I was of opinion the Chevalier had no\r\nright to the estate, and as he had determined the treaty gave him a\r\nright, I suppose he made the inference for me, that the treaty was of\r\nno weight. The Count de Vergennes mentioned it to me in such a manner,\r\nthat I found it was necessary to explain the case to him, and show\r\nhim the treaty had nothing to do with it. I enclose you a copy of the\r\nexplanation I delivered him.\r\n\r\nMr. Boylston sold his cargo to an agent of Monsieur Sangrain. He got\r\nfor it fifty-five livres the hundred weight. I do not think that his\r\nbeing joined to a company here would contribute to its success. His\r\ncapital is not wanting. Le Conteux has agreed that the merchants\r\nof Boston, sending whale oil here, may draw on him for a certain\r\nproportion of money, only giving such a time in their drafts, as will\r\nadmit the actual arrival of the oil into a port of France, for his\r\nsecurity. Upon these drafts, Mr. Barrett is satisfied they will be able\r\nto raise money, to make their purchases in America. The duty is seven\r\nlivres and ten sols on the barrel of five hundred and twenty pounds,\r\nFrench, and ten sous on every livre, which raises it to eleven livres\r\nand five sols, the sum I mentioned to you. France uses between five and\r\nsix millions of pounds' weight French, which is between three and four\r\nthousand tons, English. Their own fisheries do not furnish one million,\r\nand there is no probability of their improving. Sangrain purchases\r\nhimself upwards of a million. He tells me our oil is better than the\r\nDutch or English, because we make it fresh, whereas they cut up the\r\nwhale, and bring it home to be made, so that it is, by that time,\r\nentered into fermentation. Mr. Barrett says, that fifty livres the\r\nhundred weight will pay the prime cost and duties, and leave a profit\r\nof sixteen per cent to the merchant. I hope that England will, within\r\na year or two, be obliged to come here to buy whale oil for her lamps.\r\n\r\nI like as little as you do to have the gift of appointments. I hope\r\nCongress will not transfer the appointment of their consuls to their\r\nministers. But if they do, Portugal is more naturally under the\r\nsuperintendence of the minister at Madrid, and still more naturally\r\nunder that of the minister at Lisbon, where it is clear they ought to\r\nhave one. If all my hopes fail, the letters of Governor Bowdoin and\r\nCushing, in favor of young Mr. Warren, and your more detailed testimony\r\nin his behalf, are not likely to be opposed by evidence of equal\r\nweight, in favor of any other. I think with you, too, that it is for\r\nthe public interest to encourage sacrifices and services, by rewarding\r\nthem, and that they should weigh to a certain point, in the decision\r\nbetween candidates.\r\n\r\nI am sorry for the illness of the Chevalier Pinto. I think that treaty\r\nimportant; and the moment to urge it is that of a treaty between France\r\nand England.\r\n\r\nLambe, who left this place the 6th of November, was at Madrid the 10th\r\nof this month. Since his departure, Mr. Barclay has discovered that no\r\ncopies of the full powers were furnished to himself, nor of course to\r\nLambe. Colonel Franks has prepared copies, which I will endeavor to\r\nget, to send by this conveyance for your attestation; which you will\r\nbe so good as to send back by the first safe conveyance, and I will\r\nforward them. Mr. Barclay and Colonel Franks being at this moment at\r\nSt. Germain's, I am not sure of getting the papers in time to go by Mr.\r\nDalrymple. In that case, I will send them by Mr. Bingham.\r\n\r\nBe so good as to present me affectionately to Mrs. and Miss Adams, to\r\nColonels Smith and Humphreys, and accept assurances of the esteem with\r\nwhich I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO F. HOPKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, January 3, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last, on the 25th of September. Since that,\r\nI have received yours of October the 25th, enclosing a duplicate of\r\nthe last invented tongue for the harpsichord. The letter enclosing\r\nanother of them, and accompanied by newspapers, which you mention in\r\nthat of October the 25th, has never come to hand. I will embrace the\r\nfirst opportunity of sending you the crayons. Perhaps they may come\r\nwith this, which I think to deliver to Mr. Bingham, who leaves us on\r\nSaturday, for London. If, on consulting him, I find the conveyance from\r\nLondon uncertain, you shall receive them by a Mr. Barrett, who goes\r\nfrom hence for New York, next month. You have not authorized me to try\r\nto avail you of the new tongue. Indeed, the ill success of my endeavors\r\nwith the last does not promise much with this. However, I shall try.\r\nHoudon only stopped a moment, to deliver me your letter, so that I have\r\nnot yet had an opportunity of asking his opinion of the improvement.\r\nI am glad you are pleased with his work. He is among the foremost, or,\r\nperhaps, the foremost artist in the world.\r\n\r\nTurning to your Encyclopedie, Arts et Metiers, tome 3, part 1, page\r\n393, you will find mentioned an instrument, invented by a Monsieur\r\nRenaudin, for determining the true time of the musical movements,\r\nlargo, adagio, &c. I went to see it. He showed me his first invention;\r\nthe price of the machine was twenty-five guineas; then his second,\r\nwhich he had been able to make for about half that sum. Both of these\r\nhad a mainspring and a balance wheel, for their mover and regulator.\r\nThe strokes were made by a small hammer. He then showed me his last,\r\nwhich is moved by a weight and regulated by a pendulum, and which cost\r\nonly two guineas and a half. It presents, in front, a dial-plate like\r\nthat of a clock, on which are arranged, in a circle, the words largo,\r\nadagio, andante, allegro, presto. The circle is moreover divided into\r\nfifty-two equal degrees. Largo is at 1, adagio at 11, andante at 22,\r\nallegro at 36, and presto at 46. Turning the index to any one of these,\r\nthe pendulum (which is a string, with a ball hanging to it) shortens or\r\nlengthens, so that one of its vibrations gives you a crotchet for that\r\nmovement. This instrument has been examined by the academy of music\r\nhere, who are so well satisfied of its utility, that they have ordered\r\nall music which shall be printed here, in future, to have the movements\r\nnumbered in correspondence with this plexi-chronometer. I need not\r\ntell you that the numbers between two movements, as between 22 and 36,\r\ngive the quicker or slower degrees of the movements, such as the quick\r\nandante, or moderate allegro. The instrument is useful, but still it\r\nmay be greatly simplified. I got him to make me one, and having fixed\r\na pendulum vibrating seconds, I tried by that the vibrations of his\r\npendulum, according to the several movements.\r\n\r\n     I find the pendulum regulated to Largo }          { 52 }\r\n                                     Adagio }          { 60 } times\r\n                                    Andante } vibrates { 70 } in a\r\n                                    Allegro }          { 95 } minute.\r\n                                     Presto }          {135 }\r\n\r\nEvery one, therefore, may make a chronometer adapted to his instrument.\r\n\r\nFor a harpsichord, the following occurs to me.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n     Largo,   1\r\n     Adagio,  2\r\n     Andante, 3\r\n     Allegro, 4\r\n     Presto,  5]\r\n\r\nIn the wall of your chamber, over the instrument, drive five little\r\nbrads, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, in the following manner. Take a string with\r\na bob to it, of such length, as that hung on No. 1, it shall vibrate\r\nfifty-two times in a minute. Then proceed by trial to drive No. 2, at\r\nsuch a distance, that drawing the loop of the string to that, the part\r\nremaining between 1 and the bob, shall vibrate sixty times in a minute.\r\nFix the third for seventy vibrations, &c.; the cord always hanging over\r\nNo. 1, as the centre of vibration. A person, playing on the violin, may\r\nfix this on his music stand. A pendulum thrown into vibration, will\r\ncontinue in motion long enough to give you the time of your piece. I\r\nhave been thus particular, on the supposition that you would fix one of\r\nthese simple things for yourself.\r\n\r\nYou have heard often of the metal, called platina, to be found only\r\nin South America. It is insusceptible of rust, as gold and silver\r\nare, none of the acids affecting it, excepting the aqua regia. It\r\nalso admits of as perfect a polish as the metal hitherto used for\r\nthe specula of telescopes. These two properties had suggested to the\r\nSpaniards the substitution of it for that use. But the mines being\r\nclosed up by the government, it is difficult to get the metal. The\r\nexperiment has been lately tried here by the Abbé Rochon, (whom I\r\nformerly mentioned to Mr. Rittenhouse, as having discovered that\r\nlenses of certain natural crystals have two different and uncombined\r\nmagnifying powers) and he thinks the polish as high as that of the\r\nmetal heretofore used, and that it will never be injured by the air,\r\na touch of the finger, &c. I examined it in a dull day, which did not\r\nadmit a fair judgment of the strength of its reflection.\r\n\r\nGood qualities are sometimes misfortunes. I will prove it from\r\nyour own experience. You are punctual; and almost the only one of\r\nmy correspondents on whom I can firmly rely for the execution of\r\ncommissions which combine a little trouble with more attention. I am\r\nvery sorry, however, that I have three commissions to charge you with,\r\nwhich will give you more than a little trouble. Two of them are for\r\nMonsieur de Buffon. Many, many years ago, Cadwallader Colden wrote a\r\nvery small pamphlet on the subjects of attraction and impulsion, a copy\r\nof which he sent to Monsieur de Buffon. He was so charmed with it, that\r\nhe put it into the hands of a friend to translate, who lost it. It has\r\never since weighed on his mind, and he has made repeated trials to have\r\nit found in England. But in vain. He applied to me. I am in hopes, if\r\nyou will write a line to the booksellers of Philadelphia to rummage\r\ntheir shops, that some of them may find it. Or, perhaps, some of the\r\ncareful old people of Pennsylvania or New Jersey may have preserved a\r\ncopy. In the King's cabinet of Natural history, of which Monsieur de\r\nBuffon has the superintendence, I observed that they had neither our\r\ngrouse nor our pheasant. These, I know, may be bought in the market of\r\nPhiladelphia, on any day while they are in season. Pray buy the male\r\nand female of each, and employ some apothecary's boy to prepare them,\r\nand pack them. Methods may be seen in the preliminary discourse to the\r\nfirst volume of Birds, in the Encyclopedie, or in the Natural history\r\nof Buffon, where he describes the King's cabinet. And this done, you\r\nwill be so good as to send them to me. The third commission is more\r\ndistant. It is to procure me two or three hundred paccan-nuts from\r\nthe western country. I expect they can always be got at Pittsburg,\r\nand am in hopes, that by yourself or your friends, some attentive\r\nperson there may be engaged to send them to you. They should come as\r\nfresh as possible, and come best, I believe, in a box of sand. Of this\r\nBarham could best advise you. I imagine vessels are always coming from\r\nPhiladelphia to France. If there be a choice of ports, Havre would\r\nbe best. I must beg you to direct them to the care of the American\r\nconsul or agent at the port, to be sent by the Diligence or Fourgon. A\r\nthousand apologies would not suffice for this trouble, if I meant to\r\npay you in apologies only. But I sincerely ask, and will punctually\r\nexecute, the appointment of your chargé des affaires in Europe\r\ngenerally. From the smallest to the highest commission, I will execute\r\nwith zeal and punctuality, in buying, or doing anything you wish, on\r\nthis side the water. And you may judge from the preceding specimen,\r\nthat I shall not be behind hand in the trouble I shall impose on you.\r\nMake a note of all the expenses attending my commissions, and favor\r\nme with it every now and then, and I will replace them. My daughter is\r\nwell, and retains an affectionate remembrance of her ancient patroness,\r\nyour mother, as well as your lady and family. She joins me in wishing\r\nto them, and to Mr. and Mrs. Rittenhouse and family, every happiness.\r\nAccept, yourself, assurances of the esteem with which I am, dear Sir,\r\nyour friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. What is become of the Lunarium for the King?\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. CARY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, January 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The very few of my countrymen, who happen to be punctual,\r\nwill find their punctuality a misfortune to them. Of this, I shall give\r\nyou a proof by the present application, which I should not make to you\r\nif I did not know you to be superior to the torpidity of our climate.\r\nIn my conversations with the Count de Buffon on the subjects of natural\r\nhistory, I find him absolutely unacquainted with our elk and our deer.\r\nHe has hitherto believed that our deer never had horns more than a\r\nfoot long; and has, therefore, classed them with the roe buck, which\r\nI am sure you know them to be different from. I have examined some of\r\nthe red deer of this country at the distance of about sixty yards, and\r\nI find no other difference between them and ours than a shade or two\r\nin the color. Will you take the trouble to procure for me the largest\r\npair of buck's horns you can, and a large skin of each color, that\r\nis to say, a red and a blue? If it were possible to take these from a\r\nbuck just killed, to leave all the bones of the head in the skin, with\r\nthe horns on, to leave the bones of the legs in the skin also, and\r\nthe hoofs to it, so that, having only made an incision all along the\r\nbelly and neck, to take the animal out at, we could, by sewing up that\r\nincision, and stuffing the skin, present the true size and form of the\r\nanimal, it would be a most precious present. Our deer have been often\r\nsent to England and Scotland. Do you know (with certainty) whether they\r\nhave ever bred with the red deer of those countries? With respect to\r\nthe elk, I despair of your being able to get for me anything but the\r\nhorns of it. David Ross, I know, has a pair; perhaps he would give\r\nthem to us. It is useless to ask for the skin and skeleton, because\r\nI think it not in your power to get them, otherwise, they would be\r\nmost desirable. A gentleman, fellow passenger with me from Boston to\r\nEngland, promised to send to you, in my name, some hares, rabbits,\r\npheasants, and partridges, by the return of the ship, which was to go\r\nto Virginia, and the captain promised to take great care of them. My\r\nfriend procured the animals, and the ship changing her destination,\r\nhe kept them in hopes of finding some other conveyance, till they all\r\nperished. I do not despair, however, of finding some opportunity still\r\nof sending a colony of useful animals. I am making a collection of\r\nvines for wine and for the table; also of some trees, such as the cork\r\noak, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nEverything is absolutely quiet in Europe. There is not, therefore, a\r\nword of news to communicate. I pray you to present me affectionately to\r\nyour family, and that of Tuckahoe. Whatever expense is necessary for\r\nprocuring me the articles above-mentioned, I will instantly replace,\r\neither in cash or in anything you may wish from hence.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR GENERAL GREENE.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, January 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of June the 1st did not come to hand till the\r\n3d of September. I immediately made inquiries on the subject of the\r\nfrigate you had authorized your relation to sell to this government,\r\nand I found that he had long before that sold her to government, and\r\nsold her very well, as I understood. I noted the price on the back\r\nof your letter, which I have since unfortunately mislaid, so that I\r\ncannot at this moment state to you the price. But the transaction is\r\nof so long a standing that you cannot fail to have received advice of\r\nit. I should without delay have given you this information, but that I\r\nhoped to be able to accompany it with information as to the live oak,\r\nwhich was another object of your letter. This matter, though it has\r\nbeen constantly pressed by Mr. St. John, and also by the Marquis de La\r\nFayette since his return from Berlin, has been spun to a great length,\r\nand at last they have only decided to send to you for samples of the\r\nwood. Letters on this subject from the Marquis de La Fayette accompany\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nEverything in Europe is quiet, and promises quiet for at least a year\r\nto come. We do not find it easy to make commercial arrangements in\r\nEurope. There is a want of confidence in us. This country has lately\r\nreduced the duties on American whale oil to about a guinea and a half\r\nthe ton, and I think they will take the greatest part of what we can\r\nfurnish. I hope, therefore, that this branch of our commerce will\r\nresume its activity. Portugal shows a disposition to court our trade,\r\nbut this has for some time been discouraged by the hostilities of the\r\npiratical States of Barbary. The Emperor of Morocco, who had taken\r\none of our vessels, immediately consented to suspend hostilities, and\r\nultimately gave up the vessel, cargo and crew. I think we shall be able\r\nto settle matters with him. But I am not sanguine as to the Algerines.\r\nThey have taken two of our vessels, and I fear will ask such a tribute\r\nfor a forbearance of their piracies as the United States would be\r\nunwilling to pay. When this idea comes across my mind, my faculties\r\nare absolutely suspended between indignation and impatience. I think,\r\nwhatever sums we are obliged to pay for freedom of navigation in the\r\nEuropean seas, should be levied on the European commerce with us by\r\na separate impost, that these powers may see that they protect these\r\nenormities for their own loss.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, January 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--You were here the last year when the interest due to the French\r\nofficers was paid to them, and were sensible of the good effect it had\r\non the credit and honor of the United States. A second year's interest\r\nis become due. They have presented their demands. There is not money\r\nhere to pay them; the pittance, remaining in Mr. Grand's hands, being\r\nonly sufficient to pay current expenses three months longer. The\r\ndissatisfaction of these officers is extreme, and their complaints\r\nwill produce the worst effect. The Treasury Board has not ordered\r\ntheir payment, probably because they knew there would not be money.\r\nThe amount of their demand is about forty-two thousand livres, and Mr.\r\nGrand has in his hands but twelve thousand. I have thought it my duty,\r\nunder this emergency, to ask you whether you could order that sum for\r\ntheir relief from the funds in Holland? If you can, I am persuaded it\r\nwill have the best of effects.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial ambassador took me apart the other day at Count\r\nd'Aranda's, and observed to me that Dr. Franklin, about eighteen or\r\ntwenty months ago, had written to him a letter proposing a treaty\r\nof commerce between the Emperor and the United States: that he had\r\ncommunicated it to the Emperor, and had answered to Dr. Franklin that\r\nthey were ready to enter into arrangements for that purpose, but that\r\nhe had since that received no reply from us. I told him I knew well\r\nthat Dr. Franklin had written as he mentioned, but that this was the\r\nfirst mention I had ever heard made of any answer to the letter. That,\r\non the contrary, we had always supposed it was unanswered, and had\r\ntherefore expected the next step from him. He expressed his wonder at\r\nthis, and said he would have the copy of his answer sought for and send\r\nit to me. However, he observed that this matter being now understood\r\nbetween us, the two countries might proceed to make the arrangements.\r\nI told him the delay had been the more unlucky, as our powers were now\r\nnear expiring. He said he supposed Congress could have no objections to\r\nrenew them, or perhaps to send some person to Brussels to negotiate the\r\nmatter there. We remitted all further discussion till he should send\r\nme a copy of his letter. He has not yet done it, and I doubt whether\r\nhe has not forgotten the substance of his letter which probably was no\r\nmore than an acknowledgment of the receipt of Dr. Franklin's, and a\r\npromise to transmit it to his court. If he had written one proposing\r\nconferences, it could never have got safe to Dr. Franklin. Be this\r\nas it will, he now makes advances, and I pray you to write me your\r\nsentiments immediately as to what is best to be done on our part. I\r\nwill endeavor to evade an answer till I can hear from you. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, January 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had just closed the preceding letter when M. de\r\nBlumendorff, the Imperial Secretary of Legation, called on me with the\r\nanswer of Dr. Franklin. It was that of September 28, 1784, which you\r\nremember as well as myself, wherein Count Merci informed us the Emperor\r\nwas disposed to enter into commercial arrangements with us, and that\r\nhe would give orders to the government of the Austrian Netherlands to\r\ntake the necessary measures. I observed to M. de Blumendorff that this\r\nanswer showed the next step was to come from them. He acknowledged it,\r\nbut said these orders having been for the Netherlands only, they had\r\nwaited in expectation of others for comprehending Hungary, Bohemia,\r\nand the Austrian dominions in general, and that they still expect such\r\ninstructions. I told him, while they should be expecting them, I would\r\nwrite to you on the subject, as it was necessary for us to act jointly\r\nin this business. I think they are desirous of treating, and will urge\r\nit. I shall be anxious, therefore, to receive your sentiments on the\r\nsubject; and renew the assurances of the esteem with which I am, dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MARQUIS DE LA ROUENE.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, January 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with your letter of the 26th of December,\r\non the subject of the interest due to the foreign officers. An express\r\ninstruction of Congress having subjected their moneys in Europe to the\r\norder of their Board of Treasury only, leaves me without the power\r\nof giving the order you desire. However, wishing to do whatever was\r\npossible for those officers, I went to Mr. Grand's to consult him\r\non the subject. He informed me he had received no orders to make the\r\npayment, and, moreover, that there was no money, had he received an\r\norder. I have therefore written to Mr. Adams at London, to know whether\r\nthere is any money in Holland subject to his order, from which this\r\nsum could be supplied. But, in truth, I have no expectations from that\r\nquarter, and only tried it because there was a possibility of aid from\r\nthence. I wrote, however, to Congress, praying their immediate and\r\neffectual interposition. From this, I hope better effects. But it will\r\nbe three months at least before their order can be received. So soon\r\nas they shall be known to me, I shall certainly make it my duty to\r\ncommunicate them to you. And have the honor to be, with much respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, January 24, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with your Excellency's two letters of\r\nSeptember 10th and that of October 14th, 1785. The former were brought\r\nme by Mr. Houdon, who is returned with the necessary moulds and\r\nmeasures for General Washington's statue. I fear the expenses of his\r\njourney have been considerably increased by the unlucky accident of\r\nhis tools, materials, clothes, &c., not arriving at Havre in time to\r\ngo with him to America, so that he had to supply himself there. The\r\nmoney which you were so kind as to send by Captain Littlepage for the\r\npurpose of this statue, he found himself obliged to deposit in New\r\nYork, to satisfy a demand made on him there. This was a debt which he\r\nowed to Mr. Jay. He assures me that in a settlement with his guardian,\r\nthe latter took credit for this debt, so as to be answerable to Mr. Jay\r\nfor it, and of course to the State, now that Mr. Jay is paid with the\r\nState's money. I mention this circumstance that your Excellency may be\r\nenabled to take the earliest measures for recovering this money, and\r\nindemnifying the State. Mr. Littlepage, to satisfy me, had obtained\r\nfrom the Marquis de La Fayette his engagement to stand bound as Mr.\r\nLittlepage's security for the payment of this money. But knowing the\r\npunctuality and responsibility of his guardian, I did not suppose a\r\nsecurity necessary. Besides, if a loss was to be incurred, I know too\r\nwell the sentiments of the State of Virginia towards the Marquis de\r\nLa Fayette to suppose they would be willing to throw the loss on him.\r\nI therefore acted as I thought your Excellency and the Council would\r\nhave directed me to act, could you have been consulted. I waited on the\r\nMarquis, and in his presence cancelled his name from the obligation\r\nwhich had been given me, leaving only that of Mr. Littlepage. I have\r\nnow the honor to enclose you one of those instruments, duplicates of\r\nwhich had been given me by Littlepage. The first of the Marquis's Busts\r\nwill be finished next month. I shall present that one to the city of\r\nParis, because the delay has been noticed by some. I hope to be able\r\nto send another to Virginia in the course of the summer. These are to\r\ncost three thousand livres each. The agreement for the arms has been\r\nat length concluded by Mr. Barclay. He was so much better acquainted\r\nwith this business than the Marquis Fayette or myself, that we left it\r\naltogether to him. We were sensible that they might have been gotten\r\ncheaper, but not so good. However, I suppose he has given you the\r\ndetails of his proceedings, so as to render them unnecessary from me.\r\nIt will be eight months before they will be ready. The cause of this,\r\ntoo, Mr. Barclay told me he would explain to you. It is principally\r\nto insure their goodness. The bills remitted to pay for them have been\r\nhonored, and the money is lodged in Mr. Grand's hands, who was willing\r\nto allow a small interest for it.\r\n\r\nAn improvement is made here in the construction of the musket, which\r\nmay be worthy of attention. It consists in making every part of them\r\nso exactly alike, that every part of any one may be used for the same\r\npart of any other musket made by the same hand. The government here\r\nhas examined and approved the method, and is establishing a large\r\nmanufactory for the purpose. As yet the inventor has only completed\r\nthe lock of the musket on this plan. He will proceed immediately to\r\nhave the barrel, stock and their parts executed in the same way. I\r\nvisited the workman. He presented the parts of fifty locks, taken to\r\npieces and arranged in compartments. I put several together myself,\r\ntaking the pieces at hazard as they came to hand, and found them fit\r\ninterchangeably in the most perfect manner. The tools by which he\r\neffects this have, at the same time, so abridged the labor, that he\r\nthinks he shall be able to furnish the musket two livres cheaper than\r\nthe King's price. But it will be two or three years before he will be\r\nable to furnish any quantity. I have duly received the propositions of\r\nMessrs. Ross, Pleasants, &c., for furnishing tobacco to the Farmers\r\nGeneral; but Mr. Morris had, in the meantime, obtained the contract.\r\nI have been fully sensible of the baneful influence on the commerce\r\nof France and America, which this double monopoly will have. I have\r\nstruck at its root here, and spared no pains to have the form itself\r\ndemolished, but it has been in vain. The persons interested in it are\r\ntoo powerful to be opposed, even by the interest of the whole country.\r\nI mention this matter in confidence, as a knowledge of it might injure\r\nany further endeavors to attain the same object.\r\n\r\nEverything is quiet here, and will certainly remain so another year.\r\nMr. Barclay left Paris a few days ago, and will be absent from France\r\nfor some time. I shall spare no endeavors to fulfil the several objects\r\nwith which he was charged, in the best manner I can.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, January 25, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of September 28th, came to hand a few days ago.\r\nI thank you for the details on the subject of the southern and western\r\nlines. There remains thereon, one article, however, which I will still\r\nbeg you to inform me of, viz., how far is the western boundary beyond\r\nthe meridian of Pittsburg? This information is necessary to enable me\r\nto trace that boundary in my map. I shall be much gratified, also, with\r\na communication of your observations on the curiosities of the western\r\ncountry. It will not be difficult to induce me to give up the theory\r\nof the growth of shells, without their being the nidus of animals. It\r\nis only an idea, and not an opinion with me. In the Notes with which\r\nI troubled you, I had observed that there were three opinions as to\r\nthe origin of these shells. 1. That they have been deposited, even in\r\nthe highest mountains, by an universal deluge. 2. That they, with all\r\nthe calcareous stones and earths, are animal remains. 3. That they\r\ngrow or shoot as crystals do. I find that I could swallow the last\r\nopinion, sooner than either of the others; but I have not yet swallowed\r\nit. Another opinion might have been added, that some throe of nature\r\nhas forced up parts which had been the bed of the ocean. But have we\r\nany better proof of such an effort of nature, than of her shooting\r\na lapidific juice into the form of a shell? No such convulsion has\r\ntaken place in our time, nor within the annals of history; nor is the\r\ndistance greater between the shooting of the lapidific juice into the\r\nform of a crystal or a diamond, which we see, and into the form of a\r\nshell, which we do not see, than between the forcing volcanic matter a\r\nlittle above the surface, where it is in fusion, which we see, and the\r\nforcing the bed of the sea fifteen thousand feet above the ordinary\r\nsurface of the earth, which we do not see. It is not possible to\r\nbelieve any of these hypotheses; and, if we lean towards any of them,\r\nit should be only till some other is produced, more analogous to the\r\nknown operations of nature. In a letter to Mr. Hopkinson, I mentioned\r\nto him that the Abbé Rochon, who discovered the double refracting\r\npower in some of the natural crystals, had lately made a telescope\r\nwith the metal called platina, which, while it is as susceptible of\r\nas perfect a polish as the metal heretofore used for the specula of\r\ntelescopes, is insusceptible of rust, as gold and silver are. There is\r\na person here, who has hit on a new method of engraving. He gives you\r\nan ink of his composition. Write on copper plates anything of which\r\nyou would wish to take several copies, and, in an hour, the plate will\r\nbe ready to strike them off; so of plans, engravings, &c. This art\r\nwill be amusing to individuals, if he should make it known. I send you\r\nherewith the nautical almanacs for 1786, 1787, 1788, 1789, 1790, which\r\nare as late as they are published. You ask, how you may reimburse the\r\nexpense of these trifles? I answer, by accepting them; as the procuring\r\nyou a gratification, is a higher one to me than money. We have had\r\nnothing curious published lately. I do not know whether you are fond of\r\nchemical reading. There are some things in this science worth reading.\r\nI will send them to you, if you wish it. My daughter is well, and\r\njoins me in respects to Mrs. Rittenhouse and the young ladies. After\r\nasking when we are to have the Lunarium, I will close with assurances\r\nof the sincere regard and esteem, with which I am, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. STEWART, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, January 25, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received your favor of the 17th of October, which,\r\nthough you have mentioned it as the third you have written me,\r\nis the first that has come to hand. I sincerely thank you for the\r\ncommunication it contains. Nothing is so grateful to me, at this\r\ndistance, as details, both great and small, of what is passing in\r\nmy own country. Of the latter, we receive little here, because they\r\neither escape my correspondents, or are thought unworthy of notice.\r\nThis, however, is a very mistaken opinion, as every one may observe, by\r\nrecollecting, that when he has been long absent from his neighborhood,\r\nthe small news of that is the most pleasing, and occupies his first\r\nattention, either when he meets with a person from thence, or returns\r\nthither himself. I still hope, therefore, that the letter, in which\r\nyou have been so good as to give me the minute occurrences in the\r\nneighborhood of Monticello, may yet come to hand, and I venture to\r\nrely on the many proofs of friendship I have received from you, for\r\na continuance of your favors. This will be the more meritorious, as I\r\nhave nothing to give you in exchange.\r\n\r\nThe quiet of Europe, at this moment, furnishes little which can attract\r\nyour notice. Nor will that quiet be soon disturbed, at least for the\r\ncurrent year. Perhaps it hangs on the life of the King of Prussia, and\r\nthat hangs by a very slender thread. American reputation in Europe is\r\nnot such as to be flattering to its citizens. Two circumstances are\r\nparticularly objected to us; the non-payment of our debts, and the want\r\nof energy in our government. These discourage a connection with us. I\r\nown it to be my opinion, that good will arise from the destruction of\r\nour credit. I see nothing else which can restrain our disposition to\r\nluxury, and to the change of those manners which alone can preserve\r\nrepublican government. As it is impossible to prevent credit, the\r\nbest way would be to cure its ill effects, by giving an instantaneous\r\nrecovery to the creditor. This would be reducing purchases on credit\r\nto purchases for ready money. A man would then see a prison painted on\r\neverything he wished, but had not ready money to pay for.\r\n\r\nI fear, from an expression in your letter, that the people of Kentucky\r\nthink of separating, not only from Virginia (in which they are right),\r\nbut also from the confederacy. I own, I should think this a most\r\ncalamitous event, and such a one as every good citizen should set\r\nhimself against. Our present federal limits are not too large for good\r\ngovernment, nor will the increase of votes in Congress produce any ill\r\neffect. On the contrary, it will drown the little divisions at present\r\nexisting there. Our confederacy must be viewed as the nest, from which\r\nall America, North and South, is to be peopled. We should take care,\r\ntoo, not to think it for the interest of that great Continent to press\r\ntoo soon on the Spaniards. Those countries cannot be in better hands.\r\nMy fear is, that they are too feeble to hold them till our population\r\ncan be sufficiently advanced to gain it from them, piece by piece. The\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi we must have. This is all we are, as yet,\r\nready to receive. I have made acquaintance with a very sensible, candid\r\ngentleman here, who was in South America during the revolt which took\r\nplace there, while our Revolution was going on. He says, that those\r\ndisturbances (of which we scarcely heard anything) cost, on both sides,\r\nan hundred thousand lives.\r\n\r\nI have made a particular acquaintance here, with Monsieur de Buffon,\r\nand have a great desire to give him the best idea I can of our elk.\r\nPerhaps your situation may enable you to aid me in this. You could\r\nnot oblige me more than by sending me the horns, skeleton, and skin\r\nof an elk, were it possible to procure them. The most desirable form\r\nof receiving them would be, to have the skin slit from the under jaw\r\nalong the belly to the tail, and down the thighs to the knee, to take\r\nthe animal out, leaving the legs and hoofs, the bones of the head,\r\nand the horns attached to the skin. By sewing up the belly, &c., and\r\nstuffing the skin, it would present the form of the animal. However,\r\nas an opportunity of doing this is scarcely to be expected, I shall be\r\nglad to receive them detached, packed in a box, and sent to Richmond,\r\nto the care of Dr. Currie. Everything of this kind is precious here.\r\nAnd to prevent my adding to your trouble, I must close my letter, with\r\nassurances of the esteem and attachment with which I am, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, January 26, 1786.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I have been duly honored by the receipt of your letter\r\nof December the 6th, and am to thank you for the communications it\r\ncontained on the state of our funds and expectations here. Your idea,\r\nthat these communications, occasionally, may be useful to the United\r\nStates, is certainly just, as I am frequently obliged to explain our\r\nprospects of paying interest, &c., which I should better do with fuller\r\ninformation. If you would be so good as to instruct Mr. Grand always to\r\nfurnish me with a duplicate of those cash accounts which he furnishes\r\nto you, from time to time, and if you would be so good as to direct\r\nyour secretary to send me copies of such letters as you transmit to\r\nMr. Grand, advising him of the remittances he may expect, from time to\r\ntime, I should, thereby, be always informed of the sum of money on hand\r\nhere, and the probable expectations of supply. Dr. Franklin, during\r\nhis residence here, having been authorized to borrow large sums of\r\nmoney, the disposal of that money seemed naturally to rest with him.\r\nIt was Mr. Grand's practice, therefore, never to pay money, but on\r\nhis warrant. On his departure, Mr. Grand sent all money drafts to me,\r\nto authorize their payment. I informed him, that this was in no wise\r\nwithin my province, that I was unqualified to direct him in it, and,\r\nthat were I to presume to meddle, it would be no additional sanction\r\nto him. He refused, however, to pay a shilling without my order. I\r\nhave been obliged, therefore, to a nugatory interference, merely to\r\nprevent the affairs of the United States from standing still. I need\r\nnot represent to you the impropriety of my continuing to direct Mr.\r\nGrand longer than till we can receive your orders, the mischief which\r\nmight ensue from the uncertainty in which this would place you as to\r\nthe extent to which you might venture to draw on your funds here, and\r\nthe little necessity there is for my interference. Whenever you order\r\na sum of money into Mr. Grand's hands, nothing will be more natural\r\nthan your instructing him how to apply it, so as that he shall observe\r\nyour instructions alone. Among these, you would doubtless judge it\r\nnecessary to give him one standing instruction, to answer my drafts\r\nfor such sums as my office authorizes me to call for. These would be\r\nsalary, couriers, postage, and such other articles as circumstances\r\nwill require, which cannot be previously defined. These will never\r\nbe so considerable as to endanger the honor of your drafts; I shall\r\ncertainly exercise in them the greatest caution, and stand responsible\r\nto Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. Grand conceives that he has suffered in your opinion by an\r\napplication of two hundred thousand livres, during the last year,\r\ndifferently from what the office of finance had instructed him. This\r\nwas a consequence of his being thought subject to direction here, and\r\nit is but justice to relieve him from blame on that account, and to\r\nshow that it ought to fall, if anywhere, on Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams,\r\nand myself. The case was thus: The moneys here were exhausted, Mr.\r\nGrand was in advance about fifty thousand livres, and the diplomatic\r\nestablishments in France, Spain, and Holland, subsisting on his\r\nbounties, which they were subject to see stopped every moment, and\r\nfeared a protest on every bill. Other current expenses, too, were\r\ndepending on advances from him, and though these were small in their\r\namount, they sometimes involved great consequences. In this situation,\r\nhe received four hundred thousand livres, to be paid to this government\r\nfor one year's interest. We thought the honor of the United States\r\nwould suffer less by suspending half the payment to this government,\r\nreplacing Mr. Grand's advances, and providing a fund for current\r\nexpenses. We advised him so to do. I still think it was for the best,\r\nand I believe my colleagues have continued to see the matter in the\r\nsame point of view. We may have been biassed by the feelings excited by\r\nour own distressing situation. But certainly, as to Mr. Grand, no blame\r\nbelongs to him. We explained this matter in a letter to Congress, at\r\nthe time, and justice requires this explanation to you, as I conjecture\r\nthat the former one has not come to your knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe two hundred thousand livres retained, as before mentioned, have\r\nbeen applied to the purposes described, to the payment of a year's\r\ninterest to the French officers (which is about forty-two thousand\r\nlivres), and other current expenses, which, doubtless, Mr. Grand has\r\nexplained to you. About a week ago, there remained in his hands but\r\nabout twelve thousand livres. In this situation, the demands of the\r\nFrench officers for a second year's interest, were presented. But\r\nMr. Grand observed there were neither money nor orders for them. The\r\npayment of these gentlemen, the last year, had the happiest effect\r\nimaginable. It procured so many advocates for the credit and honor of\r\nthe United States, who were heard in all companies. It corrected the\r\nidea that we were unwilling to pay our debts. I fear that our present\r\nfailure towards them will give new birth to new imputations, and a\r\nrelapse of credit. Under this fear, I have written to Mr. Adams to know\r\nwhether he can have this money supplied from the funds in Holland;\r\nthough I have little hope from that quarter, because he had before\r\ninformed me, that those funds would be exhausted by the spring of the\r\npresent year, and I doubt, too, whether he would venture to order these\r\npayments, without authority from you. I have thought it my duty to\r\nstate these matters to you.\r\n\r\nI have had the honor of enclosing to Mr. Jay, Commodore Jones's\r\nreceipts for one hundred and eighty-one thousand and thirty-nine\r\nlivres, one sol and ten deniers, prize money, which (after deducing his\r\nown proportion) he is to remit to you, for the officers and soldiers\r\nwho were under his command. I take the liberty of suggesting, whether\r\nthe expense and risk of double remittances might not be saved, by\r\nordering it into the hands of Mr. Grand, immediately, for the purposes\r\nof the treasury in Europe, while you could make provision at home for\r\nthe officers and soldiers, whose demands will come in so slowly, as to\r\nleave the use of a great proportion of this money, for a considerable\r\ntime, and some of it forever. We could, then, immediately quiet the\r\nFrench officers.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and esteem,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     January 27th, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of addressing you by the way of London on the 2d\r\ninstant. Since that, yours of December 7th, has come to hand. I have\r\nnow the pleasure to inform you that Mr. Barclay having settled, as far\r\nas depended on him, the account of Monsieur de Beaumarchais, left Paris\r\non the 13th instant, to proceed to Morocco. Business obliged him to go\r\nby the way of L'Orient and Bordeaux, but he told me he should not be\r\ndetained more than one day at either place. We may probably allow him\r\nto the last of February to be at Morocco.\r\n\r\nThe imperial ambassador some days ago observed to me, that about\r\neighteen months ago Dr. Franklin had written to him a letter proposing\r\na treaty of commerce between the Emperor and the United States; that he\r\nhad communicated it to the Emperor, and had answered to Dr. Franklin,\r\nthat they were ready to enter into an agreement for that purpose, but\r\nthat he had received no reply from him. I told him I had been informed\r\nby Dr. Franklin of the letter making the proposition, but that this\r\nwas the first I had ever heard of an answer expressing their readiness\r\nto enter into negotiations. That on the contrary, we had supposed no\r\ndefinitive answer had been given; and that, of course, the next move\r\nwas on their side. He expressed astonishment at this, and seemed so\r\nconscious of having written such an answer, that he said he would\r\nhave it sought for and send it to me for my inspection. However, he\r\nobserved that the delay, having proceeded from the expectation of\r\neach party that the other was to make the next advance, and the matter\r\nbeing understood, the two parties might now proceed to enter into the\r\nnecessary arrangements. I told him that Congress had been desirous\r\nof entering into connections of amity and commerce with his Imperial\r\nMajesty; that for this purpose they had commissioned Mr. Adams, Dr.\r\nFranklin and myself, or any two of us, to treat; that reasons of\r\nprudence had obliged them to affix some term to our commissions, and\r\nthat two years were the term assigned; that the delay, therefore,\r\nwhich had happened, was the more unlucky, as these two years would\r\nexpire in the ensuing spring. He said he supposed Congress could have\r\nno objection to renew our powers, or perhaps to appoint some person\r\nto treat at Brussels. I told him I was unable to answer that, and we\r\nomitted further communication on the subject till he should send me\r\nhis letter written to Dr. Franklin. A few days after his Secretaire,\r\nd'Ambassade called on me with it. It was the letter of September 28,\r\n1784, (transmitted in due time to Congress,) wherein he had informed\r\nDr. Franklin that the Emperor was disposed to enter into commercial\r\narrangements with us, and that he would give orders to the government\r\nof the Netherlands to take the necessary measures. I observed to\r\nMonsieur de Blumendorff (the secretary), that this letter showed\r\nwe were right in our expectations of their taking the next step. He\r\nseemed sensible of it, said that the quarrel with Holland had engrossed\r\nthe attention of government, and that these orders relating to the\r\nNetherlands only, it had been expected that others had been given which\r\nshould include Hungary, Bohemia and the Austrian dominions in general,\r\nand that they still expected such orders. I told him that while they\r\nshould be attending them, I would write to Mr. Adams in London, my\r\ncolleague in this business, in concert with whom I must move in it.\r\nI think they are desirous of treating, and from questions asked me by\r\nMonsieur de Blumendorff, I suspect they have been led to that decision,\r\neither by the resolutions of Congress of April 1784, asking powers\r\nfrom the States to impose restraints on the commerce of States not\r\nconnected with us _by treaty_, or else by an act of the Pennsylvania\r\nAssembly for giving such powers to Congress, which has appeared in\r\nthe European papers. In the meantime, I own myself at a loss what to\r\ndo. Our instructions are clearly to treat. But these made a part of a\r\nsystem wise and advantageous, if executed in all its parts, but which\r\nhas hitherto failed in its most material branch,--that of connection\r\nwith the powers having American territory. Should these continue to\r\nstand aloof, it may be necessary for the United States to enter into\r\ncommercial regulations of a defensive nature. These may be embraced by\r\ntreaties with the powers having no American territory, and who are most\r\nof them as little commercial as perhaps not to offer advantages which\r\nmay countervail these embarrassments. In case of war, indeed, these\r\ntreaties will become of value, and even during peace the respectability\r\nof the Emperor, who stands at the head of one of the two parties which\r\nseem at present to divide Europe, was a lustre to those connected\r\nwith him--a circumstance not to be absolutely neglected by us under\r\nthe actual situation of things. ---- a letter from Mr. Adams on this\r\nsubject. Not trusting the posts, however, and obliged to wait private\r\nconveyances, our intercommunication is slow, and in the meanwhile our\r\ntime shortening fast. I have the honor to enclose to you a letter from\r\nthe Count de Vergennes, in favor of Mr. Dumas. With the services of\r\nthis gentleman to the United States, yourself and Dr. Franklin are\r\nbetter acquainted than I am. Those he has been able to render towards\r\neffecting the late alliance between France and the United Netherlands,\r\nare the probable ground of the present application. The minister for\r\nGeneva has desired me to have enquiries made after the Mr. Gallatin,\r\nnamed in the within paper. I will pray you to have the necessary\r\nadvertisements inserted in the papers, and to be so good as to favor\r\nme with the result. I enclose the Gazettes of France and Leyden to\r\nthis date, and have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and\r\nesteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n                                              PARIS, January 27th, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had the honor of writing to you on the 5th of October,\r\nand since that have received yours of the 1st of the same month. We\r\nwere highly pleased here with the health you enjoyed on your voyage,\r\nand with the reception you met with at home. This was no more than I\r\nexpected. Had I had a vote for the Presidentship, however, I doubt\r\nwhether I should not have withheld it from you that you might have\r\nleisure to collect and digest the papers you have written from time to\r\ntime, and which the world will expect to be given them. This side of\r\nthe globe is in a state of absolute quiet, both political and literary.\r\nNot a sheet, I think, has come out since your departure, which is worth\r\nnotice. I do not know whether before that the Abbé Rochon had thought\r\nof using the metal Platina for the specula telescope. Indeed, I believe\r\nthe thought is not his originally, but has been carried into execution\r\nbefore by the Spaniards. It is thought to take as high a polish as\r\nthe metallic composition generally used, and is not liable to rust.\r\nHoffman's method of engraving with ink was, I believe, known to you.\r\nI sent the other day to Pancouche's, by Mr. Hopkinson's desire, to get\r\nthe livraisons of the Encyclopedie which had not yet been taken out for\r\nhim, and informed Pancouche that the subscription had been made by you.\r\nHe sent me word two copies were subscribed for in your name, and at the\r\nsame time sent both of them to me. Supposing that the other may be your\r\nown, and that you had not made arrangements for having it sent you, I\r\nreceived it, and forwarded it in the same box with Mr. Hopkinson's. If\r\nyou have no better means of getting them in future, I offer my services\r\nvery cheerfully to forward them from time to time. What I have paid\r\nfor these (71 livres 10 sous), or may hereafter pay for others, you\r\ncan be so good as to replace in the hands of Mr. Hopkinson. If there\r\nshould be any other commissions to be executed here for you, I should\r\ntake real pleasure in being useful to you. Your friends here are all\r\nwell I think, and make you much the subject of their conversation. I\r\nwill trouble you to present my esteem to young Mr. Franklin, and add\r\nassurances of the real respect and regard with which I have the honor\r\nto be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, January 27, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 11th of December, and on the 11th of this\r\nmonth I received your favor of July 15th, entrusted to Mrs. McCaulay\r\nGraham. I do not know from what place she sent it. The last papers\r\nfrom America present us a very disagreeable altercation between Mr.\r\nJay, and a young man from whom he had deserved better things. Mr.\r\nCarmichael will, I fear, too, think himself involved. With him I am\r\nunacquainted personally, but he stands on advantageous grounds in\r\nthe opinion of Europe, and most especially in Spain. Every person,\r\nwhom I see from thence, speaks of him with great esteem. I mention\r\nthis for your private satisfaction, as he seemed to be little known\r\nin Congress. Mr. Jay, however, knows him well, and, notwithstanding\r\ntheir little broulerie, his candor will do him justice. Dumas is a\r\ngreat favorite both of Holland and France. You will be sensible of this\r\nfrom the application which is communicated to Mr. Jay from the Count\r\nde Vergennes. Mr. Van Bukel had solicited for him before I came from\r\nAmerica. This is a delicate matter, the more so as I believe Congress\r\nhad set the example by a letter to the King last year. True there is\r\nno comparison between the characters solicited for. The death of Mr.\r\nHardy was matter of sincere concern to us. He had excellent virtues,\r\nand only one foible, that of being too good-humored. This intelligence\r\nwas written to me from London by Colonel Humphreys, who went there in\r\nNovember last. There being nothing going on here under the commissions,\r\nto which he is Secretary, and some little matter there, he will\r\nprobably stay there some while yet, or perhaps divide his time between\r\nthat place and this. I send by this packet drawings for the Capitol\r\nand prison at Richmond. They are addressed to the Directors of the\r\npublic buildings. If you have a curiosity to see them, open the round\r\npackage which goes herewith, only be so good as to do them up again\r\nin the same way, and send them off by the first post. I think they\r\nwill be a gratification to yourself and such members as like things\r\nof that kind. You see by my writing to you of American persons and\r\nthings, that I have nothing for you from this quarter. Europe enjoys\r\nthe most perfect repose, and will do so at least for another year. I\r\nhave been in expectation of receiving instructions from you as to your\r\nEncyclopædie. But none being come, I will endeavor to send it to you by\r\nthis conveyance, if it can be got to L'Orient in time for the packet.\r\nThe re-establishment of these vessels is still doubtful; and till they\r\nbe re-established my correspondence will be very irregular. I have only\r\nto add assurances of the sincere esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. If I should be able to send on your copy of the Encyclopædie,\r\nit will be accompanied by one for Dr. Currie, which I will pray you to\r\nforward to Richmond by land or water as you see best.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. F. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, February 2, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I was honored some time ago with a letter from you of December\r\n6th, enclosing two for America, which I forwarded by the first\r\noccasion. On the 18th of this month, I received a letter from his\r\nExcellency the Count de Vergennes, expressing the interest which he\r\ntakes in your welfare, and recommending you to Congress. This I had\r\nan opportunity of forwarding from hence on the 27th of January, under\r\ncover to Mr. Jay. Yesterday I was gratified with the receipt of your\r\nfavor of January 27th, containing a copy of the resolution of Congress\r\nof October 24th, in your favor, and which I wish had been more so. With\r\nrespect to the payment of the arrearages, two things are necessary:\r\nfirst, an order from the Treasury, and secondly, money to comply with\r\nit. Mr. Grand wrote me this morning that he had not now as much left\r\nas to pay a bill of Mr. Carmichael's for 4300 livres just presented. I\r\nshall forward your letter to Mr. Jay the next week, with a request that\r\nthe necessary measures may be taken for the payment of your arrearages\r\nand interest. In the meantime, I think you would do well to write a\r\nline for the same purpose to Mr. Jay, or to the Commissioners of the\r\nTreasury. I do not mean that what I have said above should prevent\r\nyour drawing in due time for the salary of the current quarter. I\r\nwill honor the draught from a private fund with which I can take that\r\nliberty. I thank you for what you say of the notes on Virginia. It\r\nis much more than they deserve. Though the various matters they touch\r\non would have been beyond the information of any one person whatever\r\nto have treated fully, and infinitely beyond mine, yet had I at the\r\ntime of writing them, had anything more in view than the satisfying\r\na single individual, they should have been more attended to both in\r\nform and matter. Poor as they are, they have been thought worthy\r\nof a surreptitious translation here, with the appearance of which\r\nvery soon I have been threatened. This has induced me to yield to a\r\nfriendly proposition from the Abbé Morellet, to translate and publish\r\nthem himself, submitting the sheets previously to my inspection. As a\r\ntranslation by so able a hand will lessen the faults of the original,\r\ninstead of their being multiplied by a hireling translator. I shall add\r\nto it a map and such other advantages as may prevent the mortification\r\nof my seeing it appear in the injurious form threatened. I shall\r\nwith great pleasure send a copy of the original to you by the first\r\nopportunity, praying your acceptance of it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be with great esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, February 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am honored with yours of January the 19th. Mine of January\r\nthe 12th, had not, I suppose, at that time got to your hands, as the\r\nreceipt of it is unacknowledged. I shall be anxious till I receive your\r\nanswer to it.\r\n\r\nI was perfectly satisfied before I received your letter, that your\r\nopinion had been misunderstood or misrepresented in the case of the\r\nChevalier de Mezieres. Your letter, however, will enable me to say so\r\nwith authority. It is proper it should be known, that you had not given\r\nthe opinion imputed to you, though, as to the main question, it is\r\nbecome useless; Monsieur de Reyneval having assured me, that what I had\r\nwritten on that subject had perfectly satisfied the Count de Vergennes\r\nand himself, that this case could never come under the treaty. To\r\nevince, still further, the impropriety of taking up subjects gravely,\r\non such imperfect information as this court had, I have this moment\r\nreceived a copy of an act of the Georgia Assembly, placing the subjects\r\nof France, as to real estates, on the footing of natural citizens, and\r\nexpressly recognizing the treaty. Would you think anything could be\r\nadded, after this, to put this question still further out of doors?\r\nA gentleman of Georgia assured me, General Oglethorpe did not own a\r\nfoot of land in the State. I do not know whether there has been any\r\nAmerican determination on the question, whether American citizens and\r\nBritish subjects, born before the Revolution, can be aliens to one\r\nanother? I know there is an opinion of Lord Coke's, in Colvin's case,\r\nthat if England and Scotland should, in the course of descent, pass to\r\nseparate Kings, those born under the same sovereign during the union,\r\nwould remain natural subjects and not aliens. Common sense urges some\r\nconsiderations against this. Natural subjects owe allegiance; but\r\nwe owe none. Aliens are the subjects of a foreign power; we are not\r\nsubjects of a foreign power. The King, by the treaty, acknowledges our\r\nindependence; how, then, can we remain natural subjects? The King's\r\npower is, by the constitution, competent to the making peace, war and\r\ntreaties. He had, therefore, authority to relinquish our allegiance by\r\ntreaty. But if an act of parliament had been necessary, the parliament\r\npassed an act to confirm the treaty. So that it appears to me, that in\r\nthis question, fictions of law alone are opposed to sound sense.\r\n\r\nI am in hopes Congress will send a minister to Lisbon. I know no\r\ncountry with which we are likely to cultivate a more useful commerce.\r\nI have pressed this in my private letters.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to learn anything certain here, about the French and\r\nEnglish treaty. Yet, in general, little is expected to be done between\r\nthem. I am glad to hear that the Delegates of Virginia had made the\r\nvote relative to English commerce, though they afterwards repealed\r\nit. I hope they will come to it again. When my last letters came away,\r\nthey were engaged in passing the revisal of their laws, with some small\r\nalterations. The bearer of this, Mr. Lyons is a sensible, worthy young\r\nphysician, son of one of our judges, and on his return to Virginia.\r\nRemember me with affection to Mrs. and Miss Adams, Colonels Smith and\r\nHumphreys, and be assured of the esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                PARIS, February 8, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last letters were of the 1st and 20th of September, and\r\nthe 28th of October. Yours, unacknowledged, are of August the 20th,\r\nOctober the 3d, and November the 15th. I take this, the first safe\r\nopportunity, of enclosing to you the bills of lading for your books,\r\nand two others for your namesake of Williamsburg, and for the attorney,\r\nwhich I will pray you to forward. I thank you for the communication of\r\nthe remonstrance against the assessment. Mazzei, who is now in Holland,\r\npromised me to have it published in the Leyden gazette. It will do\r\nus great honor. I wish it may be as much approved by our Assembly, as\r\nby the wisest part of Europe. I have heard, with great pleasure, that\r\nour Assembly have come to the resolution of giving the regulation of\r\ntheir commerce to the federal head. I will venture to assert, that\r\nthere is not one of its opposers, who, placed on this ground, would\r\nnot see the wisdom of this measure. The politics of Europe render it\r\nindispensably necessary that, with respect to everything external, we\r\nbe one nation only, firmly hooped together. Interior government is what\r\neach State should keep to itself. If it were seen in Europe that all\r\nour States could be brought to concur in what the Virginia Assembly has\r\ndone, it would produce a total revolution in their opinion of us, and\r\nrespect for us. And it should ever be held in mind, that insult and\r\nwar are the consequences of a want of respectability in the national\r\ncharacter. As long as the States exercise, separately, those acts of\r\npower which respect foreign nations, so long will there continue to\r\nbe irregularities committed by some one or other of them, which will\r\nconstantly keep us on an ill footing with foreign nations.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your information as to my Notes. The copies I have\r\nremaining shall be sent over, to be given to some of my friends,\r\nand to select subjects in the College. I have been unfortunate here\r\nwith this trifle. I gave out a few copies only, and to confidential\r\npersons, writing in every copy a restraint against its publication.\r\nAmong others, I gave a copy to a Mr. Williams; he died. I immediately\r\ntook every precaution I could, to recover this copy. But, by some means\r\nor other, a bookseller had got hold of it. He employed a hireling\r\ntranslator, and is about publishing it in the most injurious form\r\npossible. I am now at a loss what to do as to England. Everything,\r\ngood or bad, is thought worth publishing there; and I apprehend a\r\ntranslation back from the French, and a publication here. I rather\r\nbelieve it will be most eligible to let the original come out in that\r\ncountry; but am not yet decided.\r\n\r\nI have purchased little for you in the book way, since I sent the\r\ncatalogue of my former purchases. I wish, first, to have your answer to\r\nthat, and your information, what parts of these purchases went out of\r\nyour plan. You can easily say, buy more of this kind, less of that, &c.\r\nMy wish is to conform myself to yours. I can get for you the original\r\nParis edition of the Encyclopedie, in thirty-five volumes, folio,\r\nfor six hundred and twenty livres; a good edition, in thirty-nine\r\nvolumes, 4to, for three hundred and eighty livres; and a good one, in\r\nthirty-nine volumes, 8vo, for two hundred and eighty livres. The new\r\none will be superior in far the greater number of articles; but not in\r\nall. And the possession of the ancient one has, moreover, the advantage\r\nof supplying present use. I have bought one for myself, but wait your\r\norders as to you. I remember your purchase of a watch in Philadelphia.\r\nIf it should not have proved good, you can probably sell it. In that\r\ncase, I can get for you, here, one made as perfect as human art can\r\nmake it, for about twenty-four louis. I have had such a one made by\r\nthe best and most faithful hand in Paris. It has a second hand, but no\r\nrepeating, no day of the month, nor other useless thing to impede and\r\ninjure the movements which are necessary. For twelve louis more, you\r\ncan have in the same cover, but on the back, and absolutely unconnected\r\nwith the movements of the watch, a pedometer, which shall render you an\r\nexact account of the distances you walk. Your pleasure hereon shall be\r\nawaited.\r\n\r\nHoudon has returned. He called on me, the other day, to remonstrate\r\nagainst the inscription proposed for General Washington's statue. He\r\nsays it is too long to be put on the pedestal. I told him I was not at\r\nliberty to permit any alteration, but I would represent his objection\r\nto a friend, who could judge of its validity, and whether a change\r\ncould be authorized. This has been the subject of conversations here,\r\nand various devices and inscriptions have been suggested. The one which\r\nhas appeared best to me may be translated as follows: \"Behold, Reader,\r\nthe form of George Washington. For his worth, ask History; that will\r\ntell it, when this stone shall have yielded to the decays of time. His\r\ncountry erects this monument: Houdon makes it.\" This for one side.\r\nOn the second, represent the evacuation of Boston, with the motto,\r\n\"Hostibus primum fugatis.\" On the third, the capture of the Hessians,\r\nwith \"Hostibus iterum devictis.\" On the fourth, the surrender of York,\r\nwith \"Hostibus ultimum debellatis.\" This is seizing the three most\r\nbrilliant actions of his military life. By giving out, here, a wish\r\nof receiving mottos for this statue, we might have thousands offered,\r\nfrom which still better might be chosen. The artist made the same\r\nobjection, of length, to the inscription for the bust of the Marquis\r\nde La Fayette. An alteration of that might come in time still, if an\r\nalteration was wished. However, I am not certain that it is desirable\r\nin either case. The State of Georgia has given twenty thousand acres\r\nof land to the Count d'Estaing. This gift is considered here as very\r\nhonorable to him, and it has gratified him much. I am persuaded, that\r\na gift of lands by the State of Virginia to the Marquis de La Fayette\r\nwould give a good opinion here of our character, and would reflect\r\nhonor on the Marquis. Nor, am I sure that the day will not come when it\r\nmight be an useful asylum to him. The time of life at which he visited\r\nAmerica was too well adapted to receive good and lasting impressions to\r\npermit him ever to accommodate himself to the principles of monarchical\r\ngovernment; and it will need all his own prudence, and that of his\r\nfriends, to make this country a safe residence for him. How glorious,\r\nhow comfortable in reflection, will it be, to have prepared a refuge\r\nfor him in case of a reverse. In the meantime, he could settle it with\r\ntenants from the freest part of this country, Bretaigne. I have never\r\nsuggested the smallest idea of this kind to him; because the execution\r\nof it should convey the first notice. If the State has not a right to\r\ngive him lands with their own officers, they could buy up, at cheap\r\nprices, the shares of others. I am not certain, however, whether in\r\nthe public or private opinion, a similar gift to Count Rochambeau\r\ncould be dispensed with. If the State could give to both, it would\r\nbe better; but, in any event, I think they should to the Marquis.\r\nCount Rochambeau, too, has really deserved more attention than he has\r\nreceived. Why not set up his bust, that of Gates, Greene, Franklin,\r\nin your new capitol? Apropos of the capitol. Do, my dear friend, exert\r\nyourself to get the plan, begun on, set aside, and that adopted, which\r\nwas drawn here. It was taken from a model which has been the admiration\r\nof sixteen centuries; which has been the object of as many pilgrimages\r\nas the tomb of Mahomet; which will give unrivalled honor to our State,\r\nand furnish a model whereon to form the taste of our young men. It\r\nwill cost much less, too, than the one begun; because it does not\r\ncover one-half of the area. Ask, if you please, a sight of my letter of\r\nJanuary the 26th, to Messrs. Buchanan and Hay, which will spare me the\r\nrepeating its substance here.\r\n\r\nEverything is quiet in Europe. I recollect but one new invention in\r\nthe arts, which is worth mentioning. It is a mixture of the arts of\r\nengraving and printing, rendering both cheaper. Write or draw anything\r\non a plate of brass, with the ink of the inventor, and, in half\r\nan hour, he gives you engraved copies of it, so perfectly like the\r\noriginal, that they could not be suspected to be copies. His types for\r\nprinting a whole page are all in one solid piece. An author, therefore,\r\nonly prints a few copies of his work, from time to time, as they\r\nare called for. This saves the loss of printing more copies than may\r\npossibly be sold, and prevents an edition from being ever exhausted.\r\n\r\nI am, with a lively esteem, dear Sir, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR HILLIARD D'AUBERTEUIL.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, February 20, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with your letter, and the books which\r\naccompanied it, for which I return you my hearty thanks. America cannot\r\nbut be flattered with the choice of the subject, on which you are\r\nat present employing your pen. The memory of the American Revolution\r\nwill be immortal, and will immortalize those who record it. The reward\r\nis encouraging, and will justify all those pains, which a rigorous\r\ninvestigation of facts will render necessary. Many important facts,\r\nwhich preceded the commencement of hostilities, took place in England.\r\nThese may mostly be obtained from good publications in that country.\r\nSome took place in this country. They will be probably hidden from\r\nthe present age. But America is the field where the greatest mass\r\nof important events were transacted, and where alone they can now\r\nbe collected. I, therefore, much applaud your idea of going to that\r\ncountry, for the verification of the facts you mean to record. Every\r\nman there can tell you more than any man here, who has not been there;\r\nand the very ground itself will give you new insight into some of\r\nthe most interesting transactions. If I can be of service to you, in\r\npromoting your object there, I offer myself freely to your use. I shall\r\nbe flattered by the honor of your visit here, at any time. I am seldom\r\nfrom home before noon; but if any later hour should suit you better, I\r\nwill take care to be at home, at any hour and day you will be pleased\r\nto indicate.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. BANCROFT.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, February 26, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 21st instant, on the subject of Mr.\r\nParadise, which I hope you have received.\r\n\r\nBy the death of Mr. Williams, a copy of my Notes on Virginia got into\r\nthe hands of a bookseller, who was about publishing a very abominable\r\ntranslation of them, when the Abbé Morellet heard of it, and diverted\r\nhim from it by undertaking to translate it for him. They will thus\r\nappear in French in spite of my precautions. The Abbé engaged me\r\nto make a map, which I wish to have engraved in London. It is on a\r\nsingle sheet, twenty-three inches square, and very closely written. It\r\ncomprehends from Albemarle Sound to Lake Erie, and from Philadelphia to\r\nthe mouth of the great Kanawha, containing Virginia and Pennsylvania,\r\na great part of Maryland, and a part of North Carolina. It is taken\r\nfrom Suell, Hutchins, and Fry and Jefferson. I wish the favor of you\r\nto make two propositions for me, and to inform me of the result. 1.\r\nTo know from one of the best engravers how much he will ask for the\r\nplate and engraving, and in how short a time after he received the\r\noriginal can he furnish the plate, done in the best manner; for the\r\ntime is material, as the work is in the press. 2. To know of Faden,\r\nor any other map merchant, for how much he will undertake to furnish\r\nme 1,800 copies, on my sending the map to him, and in what time can he\r\nfurnish them. On this alternative, I am to have nothing to do with the\r\nengraver, or any person but the undertaker. I am of opinion, he may\r\nfurnish them to me for nothing, and fully indemnify himself by the sale\r\nof the maps. Though it is on a scale of only an inch to twenty miles,\r\nit is as particular as the four-sheet maps from which it is taken, and\r\nI answer for the exactness of the reduction. I have supplied some new\r\nplaces, though the first object which induced me to undertake it was\r\nto make a map for my book. I soon extended my view to the making as\r\ngood a map of those counties as my materials would admit; and I have no\r\ndoubt but that in the States of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia,\r\n600 copies can be sold for a dollar apiece. I shall finish it in about\r\na fortnight, except the divisions in the counties of Virginia, which\r\nI cannot do at all till I can get Henry's map of Virginia. This I must\r\ntrouble you to procure for me, and send immediately by the diligence;\r\nand also give me information on the premises as soon as possible.\r\nYou will perceive that time will press. I hope the circumstances of\r\nthis affair will plead my pardon for the trouble I am giving you.\r\nThe expense of procuring and sending the map shall be replaced, and\r\nan infinitude of thanks attend you. Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. I do not propose that my name shall appear on the map, because it\r\nwill belong to its original authors, and because I do not wish to place\r\nmyself at the bar of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\n                                               PARIS, February 28, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Circumstances of public duty calling me suddenly to London, I\r\ntake the liberty of mentioning it to your Excellency, and of asking\r\na few minutes' audience of you, at as early a day and hour as will be\r\nconvenient to you, and that you will be so good as to indicate them to\r\nme. I would wish to leave Paris about Friday or Saturday, and suppose\r\nthat my stay in London will be of about three weeks. I shall be happy\r\nto be the bearer of any commands your Excellency may have for that\r\nplace, and will faithfully execute them. I cannot omit mentioning,\r\nhow pleasing it would be to me to be enabled, before my departure, to\r\nconvey to the American prisoners at St. Pol de Leon such mitigation of\r\ntheir fate as may be thought admissible.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect and\r\nesteem, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE J. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, March 5, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The several commissions to which Congress were pleased to appoint\r\nColonel Humphreys Secretary of Legation, being shortly to expire,\r\nand a French packet offering him a convenient passage in the month\r\nof April, he proposes to avail himself of that occasion of returning\r\nto his own country, and of then presenting his respects and thanks to\r\nCongress, as a member of the several commissions with which his office\r\nwas connected. I think it my duty to bear testimony to his ready, able,\r\nand faithful discharge of all its duties; and I beg leave, through\r\nyou, to present this testimony to Congress, and to assure them that his\r\ntalents and disposition are such as they may repose themselves on with\r\nsecurity, should they think to avail our country of them on any future\r\noccasion. I have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem,\r\nSir, yours, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 LONDON, March 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The date of a letter from London will doubtless be as unexpected\r\nto you as it was unforeseen by myself a few days ago. On the 27th of\r\nlast month, Colonel Smith arrived in Paris with a letter from Mr.\r\nAdams, informing me that there was at this place a minister from\r\nTripoli, having general powers to enter into treaties on behalf of\r\nhis State, and with whom it was possible we might do something under\r\nour commission to that power; and that he gave reason to believe he\r\ncould also make arrangements with us for Tunis. He further added that\r\nthe minister of Portugal here had received ultimate instructions from\r\nhis court, and that probably that treaty might be concluded in the\r\nspace of three weeks were we all on the spot together. He, therefore,\r\npressed me to come over immediately. The first of these objects had\r\nsome weight on my mind, because, as we had sent no person to Tripoli or\r\nTunis, I thought if we could meet a minister from them on this ground,\r\nour arrangements would be settled much sooner, and at less expense.\r\nBut what principally decided me was the desire of bringing matters to\r\na conclusion with Portugal before the term of our commissions should\r\nexpire, or any new turn in the negotiations of France and England\r\nshould abate their willingness to fix a connection with us. A third\r\nmotive had also its weight. I hoped that my attendance here, and the\r\nnecessity of shortening it, might be made use of to force a decisive\r\nanswer from this court. I therefore concluded to comply with Mr.\r\nAdams's request. I went immediately to Versailles, and apprised the\r\nCount de Vergennes that circumstances of public duty called me hither\r\nfor three or four weeks, arranged with him some matters, and set out\r\nwith Colonel Smith for this place, where we arrived last night, which\r\nwas as early as the excessive rigor of the weather admitted. I saw Mr.\r\nAdams immediately, and again to day. He informs me that the minister\r\nof Portugal was taken ill five or six days ago, has been very much\r\nso, but is now somewhat better. It would be very mortifying, indeed,\r\nshould this accident, with the shortness of the term to which I limit\r\nmy stay here, defeat what was the principal object of my journey, and\r\nthat, without which, I should hardly have undertaken it. With respect\r\nto this country, I had no doubt but that every consideration had been\r\nurged by Mr. Adams which was proper to be urged. Nothing remains undone\r\nin this way. But we shall avail ourselves of my journey here, as if\r\nmade on purpose, just before the expiration of our commission, to form\r\nour report to Congress on the execution of that commission, which\r\nreport they may be given to know, cannot be formed without decisive\r\ninformation of the ultimate determination of their court. There is no\r\ndoubt what that determination will be; but it will be useful to have\r\nit; as it may put an end to all further expectations on our side the\r\nwater, and show that the time is come for doing whatever is to be done\r\nby us for counteracting the unjust and greedy designs of this country.\r\nWe shall have the honor, before I leave this place, to inform you of\r\nthe result of the several matters which have brought me to it.\r\n\r\nA day or two before my departure from Paris, I received your letter of\r\nJanuary --. The question therein proposed, \"How far France considers\r\nherself as bound to insist on the delivery of the posts,\" would\r\ninfallibly produce another, How far we consider ourselves as guarantees\r\nof their American possessions, and bound to enter into any future war\r\nin which these may be attacked? The words of the treaty of alliance\r\nseem to be without ambiguity on either head, yet I should be afraid to\r\ncommit Congress by answering without authority. I will endeavor, on\r\nmy return, to sound the opinion of the minister, if possible without\r\nexposing myself to the other question. Should anything forcible\r\nbe meditated on these posts, it would possibly be thought prudent,\r\npreviously, to ask the good offices of France to obtain their delivery.\r\nIn this case, they would probably say, we must first execute the treaty\r\non our part by repealing all acts which have contravened it. Now this\r\nmeasure, if there be any candor in the court of London, would suffice\r\nto obtain a delivery of the posts from them without the mediation of\r\nany third power. However, if this mediation should be finally needed,\r\nI see no reason to doubt our obtaining it, and still less to question\r\nits omnipotent influence on the British court.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n                                                 LONDON, April 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In your letter of October the 29th, you desired me to send\r\nyou one of the new lamps. I tried at every probable place in Paris,\r\nand could not get a tolerable one. I have been glad of it since I came\r\nhere, as I find them much better made here. I now deliver one, with\r\nthis letter, into the hands of Mr. Fulwar Skipwith, a merchant from\r\nVirginia, settled here, who promises to send it to you, with one for\r\nMr. C. Thomson. Be pleased to accept, this from me. It is now found\r\nthat they may be used with almost any oil.\r\n\r\nI expect to leave this place in about three days. Our public letters,\r\njoint and separate, will inform you what has been done, and what\r\ncould not be done here. With respect to a commercial treaty with\r\nthis country, be assured that this government not only has it not in\r\ncontemplation at present to make any, but that they do not conceive\r\nthat any circumstances will arise which shall render it expedient for\r\nthem to have any political connection with us. They think we shall be\r\nglad of their commerce on their own terms. There is no party in our\r\nfavor here, either in power or out of power. Even the opposition concur\r\nwith the ministry and the nation in this. I can scarcely consider as\r\na party the Marquis of Lansdowne, and a half dozen characters about\r\nhim, such as Dr. Price, &c., who are impressed with the utility of a\r\nfriendly connection with us. The former does not venture this sentiment\r\nin parliament, and the latter are not in situations to be heard. The\r\nMarquis of Lansdowne spoke to me affectionately of your brother, Doctor\r\nLee, and desired his respects to him, which I beg leave to communicate\r\nthrough you. Were he to come into the ministry (of which there is not\r\nthe most distant prospect), he must adopt the King's system, or go\r\nout again, as he did before, for daring to depart from it. When we\r\nsee, that through all the changes of ministry which have taken place\r\nduring the present reign, there has never been a change of system\r\nwith respect to America, we cannot reasonably doubt, that this is\r\nthe system of the King himself. His obstinacy of character we know;\r\nhis hostility we have known, and it is embittered by ill success. If\r\never this nation, during his life, enter into arrangements with us,\r\nit must be in consequence of events of which they do not at present\r\nsee a possibility. The object of the present ministry is to buoy up\r\nthe nation with flattering calculations of their present prosperity,\r\nand to make them believe they are better without us than with us. This\r\nthey seriously believe; for what is it men cannot be made to believe!\r\nI dined the other day in a company of the ministerial party. A General\r\nClark, a Scotchman and ministerialist, sat next to me. He introduced\r\nthe subject of American affairs, and in the course of the conversation\r\ntold me that were America to petition Parliament to be again received\r\non their former footing, the petition would be very generally rejected.\r\nHe was serious in this, and I think it was the sentiment of the\r\ncompany, and is the sentiment perhaps of the nation. In this they are\r\nwise, but for a foolish reason. They think they lost more by suffering\r\nus to participate of their commercial privileges, at home and abroad,\r\nthan they lose by our political severance. The true reason, however,\r\nwhy such an application should be rejected is, that in a very short\r\ntime, we should oblige them to add another hundred millions to their\r\ndebt in unsuccessful attempts to retain the subjection offered to them.\r\nThey are at present in a frenzy, and will not be recovered from it till\r\nthey shall have leaped the precipice they are now so boldly advancing\r\nto. Writing from England, I write you nothing but English news. The\r\ncontinent at present furnishes nothing interesting. I shall hope the\r\nfavor of your letters at times. The proceedings and views of Congress,\r\nand of the Assemblies, the opinions and dispositions of our people in\r\ngeneral, which, in governments like ours, must be the foundation of\r\nmeasures, will always be interesting to me; as will whatever respects\r\nyour own health and happiness, being with great esteem, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMSON.\r\n\r\n                                                 LONDON, April 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In one of your former letters, you expressed a wish to have\r\none of the newly-invented lamps. I find them made here much better than\r\nat Paris, and take the liberty of asking your acceptance of one, which\r\nwill accompany this letter. It is now found that any tolerable oil may\r\nbe used in them. The spermaceti oil is best, of the cheap kinds.\r\n\r\nI could write you volumes on the improvements which I find made, and\r\nmaking here, in the arts. One deserves particular notice, because it\r\nis simple, great, and likely to have extensive consequences. It is\r\nthe application of steam, as an agent for working grist mills. I have\r\nvisited the one lately made here. It was, at that time, turning eight\r\npair of stones. It consumes one hundred bushels of coal a day. It is\r\nproposed to put up thirty pair of stones. I do not know whether the\r\nquantity of fuel, is to be increased. I hear you are applying the same\r\nagent in America, to navigate boats, and I have little doubt, but that\r\nit will be applied generally to machines, so as to supersede the use of\r\nwater ponds, and of course to lay open all the streams for navigation.\r\nWe know that steam is one of the most powerful engines we can employ;\r\nand in America, fuel is abundant. I find no new publication here worth\r\nsending to you. I shall set out for Paris within three or four days.\r\nOur public letters will inform you of our proceedings here.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 LONDON, April 23, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In my letter of March the 12th, I had the honor of explaining\r\nto you the motives which had brought me to this place. A joint letter\r\nfrom Mr. Adams and myself, sent by the last packet, informed you of the\r\nresult of our conferences with the Tripoline minister. The conferences\r\nwith the minister of Portugal have been drawn to a greater length\r\nthan I expected. However, everything is now agreed, and the treaty\r\nwill be ready for signature the day after to-morrow. I shall set out\r\nfor Paris the same day. With this country nothing is done; and that\r\nnothing is intended to be done, on their part, admits not the smallest\r\ndoubt. The nation is against any change of measures; the ministers\r\nare against it; some from principle, others from subserviency; and the\r\nKing, more than all men, is against it. If we take a retrospect to the\r\nbeginning of the present reign, we observe that amidst all the changes\r\nof ministry, no change of measures with respect to America ever took\r\nplace; excepting only at the moment of the peace; and the minister of\r\nthat moment was immediately removed. Judging of the future by the past,\r\nI do not expect a change of disposition during the present reign, which\r\nbids fair to be a long one, as the King is healthy and temperate. That\r\nhe is persevering, we know. If he ever changes his plan, it will be\r\nin consequence of events, which, at present, neither himself nor his\r\nministers place among those which are probable. Even the opposition\r\ndare not open their lips in favor of a connection with us, so unpopular\r\nwould be the topic. It is not that they think our commerce unimportant\r\nto them. I find that the merchants here set sufficient value on it.\r\nBut they are sure of keeping it on their own terms. No better proof\r\ncan be shown of the security in which the ministers think themselves\r\non this head, than that they have not thought it worth while to give\r\nus a conference on the subject, though, on my arrival, we exhibited\r\nto them our commission, observed to them that it would expire on the\r\n12th of the next month, and that I had come over on purpose to see if\r\nany arrangements could be made before that time. Of two months which\r\nthen remained, six weeks have elapsed without one scrip of a pen, or\r\none word from a minister, except a vague proposition at an accidental\r\nmeeting. We availed ourselves even of that, to make another essay\r\nto extort some sort of declaration from the court. But their silence\r\nis invincible. But of all this, as well as of the proceedings in the\r\nnegotiation with Portugal, information will be given you by a joint\r\nletter from Mr. Adams and myself. The moment is certainly arrived, when\r\nthe plan of this court being out of all doubt, Congress and the States\r\nmay decide what their own measures should be.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Lansdowne spoke of you in very friendly terms, and\r\ndesired me to present his respects to you, in the first letter I should\r\nwrite. He is thoroughly sensible of the folly of the present measures\r\nof this country, as are a few other characters about him. Dr. Price is\r\namong these, and is particularly disturbed at the present prospect. He\r\nacknowledges, however, that all change is desperate; which weighs more,\r\nas he is intimate with Mr. Pitt. This small band of friends, favorable\r\nas it is, does not pretend to say one word in public on our subject.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 LONDON, April 23, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In another letter of this day, I stated to you what had passed\r\nwith public characters, since my arrival here. Conversations with\r\nprivate individuals, I thought it best not to mingle with the contents\r\nof that letter. Yet, as some have taken place which relate to matters\r\nwithin our instructions, and with persons whose opinions deserve\r\nto have some weight, I will take the liberty of stating them. In a\r\nconversation with an ancient and respectable merchant of this place,\r\nsuch a view of the true state of the commercial connections of America\r\nand Great Britain, was presented to him, as induced him to acknowledge\r\nthey had been mistaken in their opinions, and to ask that Mr. Adams and\r\nmyself would permit the chairman of the committee of American merchants\r\nto call on us. He observed that the same person happened to be also\r\nchairman of the committee of the whole body of British merchants; and\r\nthat such was the respect paid to his person and office, that we might\r\nconsider what came from him, as coming from the committees themselves.\r\nHe called on us at an appointed hour. He was a Mr. Duncan Campbell,\r\nformerly much concerned in the American trade. We entered on the\r\nsubject of the non-execution of the late treaty of peace, alleged on\r\nboth sides. We observed that the refusal to deliver the western posts,\r\nand the withdrawing American property contrary to express stipulation,\r\nhaving preceded what they considered as breaches on our part, were\r\nto be considered as the causes of our proceedings. The obstructions\r\nthrown by our legislatures in the way of the recovery of their debts,\r\nwere insisted on by him. We observed to him, that the great amount\r\nof the debt from America to Great Britain, and the little circulating\r\ncoin in the former country, rendered an immediate payment impossible;\r\nthat time was necessary; that we had been authorized to enter into\r\nexplanatory arrangements on this subject; that we had made overtures\r\nfor the purpose, which had not been attended to, and that the States\r\nhad, therefore, been obliged to modify the article for themselves. He\r\nacknowledged the impossibility of immediate payment, the propriety of\r\nan explanatory convention, and said that they were disposed to allow\r\na reasonable time. We mentioned the term of five years, including\r\nthe present; but that judgments might be allowed immediately, only\r\ndividing the execution into equal and annual parts, so that the last\r\nshould be levied by the close of the year 1790. This seemed to be\r\nquite agreeable to him, and to be as short a term as would be insisted\r\non by them. Proceeding to the sum to be demanded, we agreed that the\r\nprincipal, with the interest incurring before and after the war, should\r\nbe paid; but, as to that incurring during the war, we differed from\r\nhim. He urged its justice with respect to themselves, who had laid\r\nout of the use of their money during that period. This was his only\r\ntopic. We opposed to it all those which circumstances, both public and\r\nprivate, gave rise to. He appeared to feel their weight, but said the\r\nrenunciation of this interest was a bitter pill, and such a one as the\r\nmerchants here could not swallow. He wished that no declaration should\r\nbe made as to this article; but we observed that if we entered into\r\nexplanatory declarations of the points unfavorable to us, we should\r\nexpect, as a consideration for this, corresponding declarations on the\r\nparts in our favor. In fact, we supposed his view was to leave this\r\npart of the interest to stand on the general expressions of the treaty,\r\nthat they might avail themselves, in individual cases, of the favorable\r\ndispositions of debtors or juries. We proceeded to the necessity\r\nof arrangements of our future commerce, were it only as a means of\r\nenabling our country to pay its debts. We suggested that they had\r\nbeen contracted, while certain modes of remittance had existed here,\r\nwhich had been an inducement to us to contract these debts. He said\r\nhe was not authorized to speak on the subject of the future commerce.\r\nHe appeared really and feelingly anxious that arrangements should be\r\nstipulated as to the payment of the old debts; said he would proceed in\r\nthat moment to Lord Caermarthen's, and discuss the subject with him,\r\nand that we might expect to hear from him. He took leave, and we have\r\nnever since heard from him or any other person on the subject. Congress\r\nwill judge how far these conversations should influence their future\r\nproceedings, or those of the States.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 3, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--After begging leave to present my respects to your Excellency,\r\non my return to this place, I take the liberty of offering to your\r\nattention some papers, which I found on my arrival here, written by\r\nsundry merchants of L'Orient, and others, some of whom are citizens\r\nof the United States, and all of them concerned in the trade between\r\nthe two countries. This has been carried on, by an exchange of the\r\nmanufactures and produce of this country, for the produce of that, and\r\nprincipally for tobacco, which, though, on its arrival here, confined\r\nto a single purchaser, has been received equally from all sellers.\r\nIn confidence of a continuance of this practice, the merchants of\r\nboth countries were carrying on their commerce of exchange. A late\r\ncontract by the Farm has, in a great measure, fixed in a single\r\nmercantile house, the supplies of tobacco wanted for this country. This\r\narrangement found the established merchants with some tobacco on hand,\r\nsome on the seas coming to them, and more still due. By the papers\r\nnow enclosed, it seems that there are six thousand four hundred and\r\neight hogsheads, in the single port of L'Orient. Whether government\r\nmay interfere, as to articles furnished by the merchants after they\r\nhad notice of the contract before mentioned, must depend on principles\r\nof policy. But those of justice seem to urge, that, for commodities\r\nfurnished before such notice, they should be so far protected, as\r\nthat they may wind up without loss, the transactions in which the new\r\narrangement found them actually engaged. Your Excellency is the best\r\njudge, how far it may be consistent with the rules of government,\r\nto interfere for their relief; and with you, therefore, I beg leave\r\nentirely to rest their interests.\r\n\r\nInformation lately received, relative to the Barbary States, has\r\nsuggested, that it might be expedient, and perhaps necessary for us,\r\nto pave the way to arrangements with them, by a previous application\r\nto the Ottoman Porte. Your Excellency's intimate acquaintance with this\r\nsubject would render your advice to us equally valuable and desirable.\r\nIf you would be pleased to permit me to wait on you, any day or hour\r\nwhich shall be most convenient to yourself, I should be much gratified\r\nby a little conversation with you on this subject.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 4, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your two favors of March the 15th and August the 23d, 1785,\r\nby Monsieur de la Croix, came to hand on the 15th of November. His\r\nreturn gives me an opportunity of sending you a copy of the nautical\r\nalmanacs for 1786, '7, '8, '9. There is no late and interesting\r\npublication here, or I would send it by the same conveyance. With these\r\nalmanacs, I pack a copy of some Notes I wrote for Monsieur de Marbois,\r\nin the year 1781, of which I had a few printed here. They were written\r\nin haste, and for his private inspection. A few friends having asked\r\ncopies, I found it cheaper to print than to write them. They will offer\r\nnothing new to you, not even as an oblation of my friendship for you,\r\nwhich is as old almost as we are ourselves. Mazzei brought me your\r\nfavor of April the 28th. I thank you much for your communications.\r\nNothing can be more grateful at such a distance. It is unfortunate that\r\nmost people think the occurrences passing daily under their eyes, are\r\neither known to all the world, or not worth being known. They therefore\r\ndo not give them place in their letters. I hope you will be so good as\r\nto continue your friendly information. The proceedings of our public\r\nbodies, the progress of the public mind on interesting questions, the\r\ncasualties which happen among our private friends, and whatever is\r\ninteresting to yourself and family, will always be anxiously received\r\nby me. There is one circumstance in the work you were concerned in,\r\nwhich has not yet come to my knowledge; to wit, how far westward from\r\nFort Pitt does the western boundary of Pennsylvania pass, and where\r\ndoes it strike the Ohio? The proposition you mention from Mr. Anderson,\r\non the purchase of tobacco, I would have made use of, but that I have\r\nengaged the abuses of the tobacco trade on a more general scale. I\r\nconfess their redress is by no means certain; but, till I see all hope\r\nof removing the evil by the roots desperate, I cannot propose to prune\r\nits branches.\r\n\r\nI returned but three or four days ago from a two months' trip to\r\nEngland. I traversed that country much, and own both town and country\r\nfell short of my expectations. Comparing it with this, I found a much\r\ngreater proportion of barrens, a soil, in other parts, not naturally\r\nso good as this, not better cultivated, but better manured, and,\r\ntherefore, more productive. This proceeds from the practice of long\r\nleases there, and short ones here. The laboring people here are poorer\r\nthan in England. They pay about one half their produce in rent; the\r\nEnglish, in general, about a third. The gardening, in that country, is\r\nthe article in which it surpasses all the earth. I mean their pleasure\r\ngardening. This, indeed, went far beyond my ideas. The city of London,\r\nthough handsomer than Paris, is not so handsome as Philadelphia. Their\r\narchitecture is in the most wretched style I ever saw, not meaning to\r\nexcept America, where it is bad, nor even Virginia, where it is worse\r\nthan in any other part of America which I have seen. The mechanical\r\narts in London are carried to a wonderful perfection. But of these I\r\nneed not speak, because of them my countrymen have unfortunately too\r\nmany samples before their eyes. I consider the extravagance, which\r\nhas seized them, as a more baneful evil than toryism was during the\r\nwar. It is the more so, as the example is set by the best and most\r\namiable characters among us. Would a missionary appear, who would make\r\nfrugality the basis of his religious system, and go through the land,\r\npreaching it up as the only road to salvation, I would join his school,\r\nthough not generally disposed to seek my religion out of the dictates\r\nof my own reason, and feelings of my own heart. These things have been\r\nmore deeply impressed on my mind, by what I have heard and seen in\r\nEngland. That nation hate us, their ministers hate us, and their King,\r\nmore than all other men. They have the impudence to avow this, though\r\nthey acknowledge our trade important to them. But they think, we cannot\r\nprevent our countrymen from bringing that into their laps. A conviction\r\nof this determines them to make no terms of commerce with us. They say,\r\nthey will pocket our carrying trade as well as their own. Our overtures\r\nof commercial arrangements have been treated with a derision, which\r\nshows their firm persuasion, that we shall never unite to suppress\r\ntheir commerce, or even to impede it. I think their hostility towards\r\nus is much more deeply rooted at present, than during the war. In the\r\narts, the most striking thing I saw there, new, was the application\r\nof the principle of the steam-engine to grist mills. I saw eight pair\r\nof stones which are worked by steam, and there are to be set up thirty\r\npair in the same house. A hundred bushels of coal a day, are consumed\r\nat present. I do not know in what proportion the consumption will be\r\nincreased by the additional gear.\r\n\r\nBe so good as to present my respects to Mrs. Page and your family,\r\nto W. Lewis, F. Willis, and their families, and to accept yourself\r\nassurances of the sincere regard with which I am, dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 5, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A visit of two months to England has been the cause of\r\nyour not hearing from me during that period. Your letters of February\r\n3d, to Mr. Adams and myself, and of February 4th, to me, had come to\r\nhand before my departure. While I was in London, Mr. Adams received\r\nthe letters giving information of Mr. Lambe's arrival in Algiers. In\r\nLondon, we had conferences with a Tripoline ambassador, now at that\r\ncourt, named Abdrahaman. He asked us thirty thousand guineas for a\r\npeace with his court, and as much for Tunis, for which he said he could\r\nanswer. What we were authorized to offer, being to this but as a drop\r\nto a bucket, our conferences were repeated, only for the purpose of\r\nobtaining information. If the demands of Algiers and Morocco should be\r\nin proportion to this, according to their superior power, it is easy to\r\nforesee that the United States will not buy a peace with money. What\r\nprincipally led me to England was, the information that the Chevalier\r\ndel Pinto, Portuguese minister at that court, had received full powers\r\nto treat with us. I accordingly went there, and, in the course of six\r\nweeks, we arranged a commercial treaty between our two countries. His\r\npowers were only to negotiate, not to sign. And as I could not wait,\r\nMr. Adams and myself signed, and the Chevalier del Pinto expected daily\r\nthe arrival of powers to do the same. The footing on which each has\r\nplaced the other, is that of the most favored nation. We wished much\r\nto have had some privileges in their American possessions; but this was\r\nnot to be effected. The right to import flour into Portugal, though not\r\nconceded by the treaty, we are not without hopes of obtaining.\r\n\r\nMy journey furnished us occasion to renew our overtures to the court of\r\nLondon; which it was the more important to do, as our powers to that\r\ncourt were to expire on the 12th of this month. These overtures were\r\nnot attended to, and our commission expiring, we made our final report\r\nto Congress; and I suppose this the last offer of friendship which\r\nwill ever be made on our part. The treaty of peace being unexecuted on\r\neither part, in important points, each will now take their own measures\r\nfor obtaining execution. I think the King, ministers, and nation are\r\nmore bitterly hostile to us at present, than at any period of the late\r\nwar. A like disposition on our part has been rising for some time. In\r\nwhat events these things will end, we cannot foresee. Our countrymen\r\nare eager in their passions and enterprises, and not disposed to\r\ncalculate their interests against these. Our enemies (for such they\r\nare, in fact) have for twelve years past followed but one uniform rule,\r\nthat of doing exactly the contrary of what reason points out. Having,\r\nearly during our contest, observed this in the British conduct, I\r\ngoverned myself by it in all prognostications of their measures; and\r\nI can say, with truth, it never failed me but in the circumstance of\r\ntheir making peace with us. I have no letters from America of later\r\ndate than the new year. Mr. Adams had, to the beginning of February.\r\nI am in hopes our letters will give a new spur to the proposition, for\r\ninvesting Congress with the regulation of our commerce.\r\n\r\nThis will be handed you by a Baron Waltersdorf, a Danish gentleman,\r\nwhom, if you did not already know, I should take the liberty of\r\nrecommending to you. You were so kind as to write me that you would\r\nforward me a particular map, which has not come to hand. I beg you to\r\nbe assured of the respect and esteem with which I have the honor to be,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 6, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Having been absent in England, for some time past, your favors\r\nof February the 27th, March the 28th, and April the 11th, have not been\r\nacknowledged as soon as they should have been. I am obliged to you, for\r\nassisting to make me known to the Rhingrave de Salm and the Marquis de\r\nla Coste, whose reputations render an acquaintance with them desirable.\r\nI have not yet seen either, but expect that honor from the Rhingrave\r\nvery soon. Your letters to Mr. Jay and Mr. Van Berkel, received in my\r\nabsence, will be forwarded by a gentleman who leaves this place for New\r\nYork, within a few days. I sent the treaty with Prussia, by a gentleman\r\nwho sailed from Havre, the 11th of November. The arrival of that vessel\r\nin America is not yet known here. Though the time is not long enough\r\nto produce despair, it is sufficiently so to give inquietude lest it\r\nshould be lost. This would be a cause of much concern to me; I beg the\r\nfavor of you to mention this circumstance to the Baron de Thulemeyer,\r\nas an apology for his not hearing from us. The last advices from\r\nAmerica bring us nothing interesting. A principal object of my journey\r\nto London was to enter into commercial arrangements with Portugal.\r\nThis has been done almost in the precise terms of those of Prussia. The\r\nEnglish are still our enemies. The spirit existing there, and rising in\r\nAmerica, has a very lowering aspect. To what events it may give birth,\r\nI cannot foresee. We are young and can survive them; but their rotten\r\nmachine must crush under the trial. The animosities of sovereigns are\r\ntemporary, and may be allayed; but those which seize the whole body of\r\na people, and of a people, too, who dictate their own measures, produce\r\ncalamities of long duration. I shall not wonder to see the scenes of\r\nancient Rome and Carthage renewed in our day; and if not pursued to the\r\nsame issue, it may be because the republic of modern powers will not\r\npermit the extinction of any one of its members. Peace and friendship\r\nwith all mankind is our wisest policy; and I wish we may be permitted\r\nto pursue it. But the temper and folly of our enemies may not leave\r\nthis in our choice. I am happy in our prospect of friendship with the\r\nmost estimable powers of Europe, and particularly with those of the\r\nconfederacy, of which yours is. That your present crisis may have a\r\nhappy issue, is the prayer and wish of him who has the honor to be,\r\nwith great respect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM DRAYTON.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 6, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of November the 23d came duly to hand. A call to\r\nEngland, soon after its receipt, has prevented my acknowledging it so\r\nsoon as I should have done. I am very sensible of the honor done me\r\nby the South Carolina society for promoting and improving agriculture\r\nand other rural concerns, when they were pleased to elect me to be of\r\ntheir body; and I beg leave, through you, Sir, to convey to them my\r\ngrateful thanks for this favor. They will find in me, indeed, but a\r\nvery unprofitable servant. At present, particularly, my situation is\r\nunfavorable to the desire I feel, of promoting their views. However,\r\nI shall certainly avail myself of every occasion which shall occur,\r\nof doing so. Perhaps I may render some service, by forwarding to the\r\nsociety such new objects of culture, as may be likely to succeed in the\r\nsoil and climate of South Carolina. In an infant country, as ours is,\r\nthese experiments are important. We are probably far from possessing,\r\nas yet, all the articles of culture for which nature has fitted our\r\ncountry. To find out these, will require abundance of unsuccessful\r\nexperiments. But if, in a multitude of these, we make one useful\r\nacquisition, it repays our trouble. Perhaps it is the peculiar duty of\r\nassociated bodies, to undertake these experiments. Under this sense\r\nof the views of the society, and with so little opportunity of being\r\notherwise useful to them, I shall be attentive to procure for them the\r\nseeds of such plants, as they will be so good as to point out to me, or\r\nas shall occur to myself as worthy their notice. I send at present, by\r\nMr. McQueen, some seeds of a grass, found very useful in the southern\r\nparts of Europe, and particularly, and almost solely cultivated in\r\nMalta. It is called by the names of Sulla, and Spanish St. Foin, and\r\nis the Hedysarum coronarium of Linnæus. It is usually sown early in\r\nautumn. I shall receive a supply of fresher seed, this fall, which I\r\nwill also do myself the honor of forwarding to you. I expect, in the\r\nsame season, from the south of France, some acorns of the cork oak,\r\nwhich I propose for your society, as I am persuaded they will succeed\r\nwith you. I observed it to grow in England, without shelter; not well,\r\nindeed, but so as to give hopes that it would do well with you. I\r\nshall consider myself as always honored by the commands of the society,\r\nwhenever they shall find it convenient to make use of me, and beg you\r\nto be assured, personally, of the sentiments of respect and esteem with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. T. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--On my return from a two months' visit to England, I\r\nfound here your favor of January the 18th. This contains the latest\r\nintelligence I have from America. Your effects not being then arrived\r\ngives me anxiety for them, as I think they went in a vessel which\r\nsailed from Havre the 11th of November. In this vessel, went also the\r\ntwo Mr. Fitzhughs of Virginia, with the Prussian treaty, our papers\r\nrelative to the Barbary States, with the despatches for Congress,\r\nand letters which I had been writing to other persons in America\r\nfor six weeks preceding their departure. I am obliged to you for\r\nthe information as to Dr. Franklin's health, in which I feel a great\r\ninterest. I concur in opinion with you, that in the present factious\r\ndivision of your State, an angel from heaven could do no good. I have\r\nbeen sorry, therefore, from the beginning, to see such time as Dr.\r\nFranklin's wasted on so hopeless a business. You have formed a just\r\nopinion of Monroe. He is a man whose soul might be turned wrong side\r\noutwards, without discovering a blemish to the world. I wish with\r\nall my heart, Congress may call you into the diplomatic line, as that\r\nseems to have attracted your own desires. It is not one in which you\r\ncan do anything more than pass the present hour agreeably, without any\r\nprospect to future provision. Perhaps, the arrangements with Portugal,\r\nby adding to the number of those appointments, may give Congress\r\nan opportunity of doing justice to your own, and to Dr. Franklin's\r\nservices. If my wishes could aid you, you have them sincerely. My\r\nlate return to this place scarcely enables me to give you any of its\r\nnews. I have not yet called on M. La Veillard, or seen any of your\r\nacquaintances. The marriage of the ambassador of Sweden with Miss\r\nNeckar, you have heard of. Houdon is about taking a wife also. His bust\r\nof the General has arrived, and meets the approbation of those who know\r\nthe original. Europe enjoys a perfect calm, at present. Perhaps it may\r\nbe disturbed by the death of the King of Prussia, which is constantly\r\nexpected. As yet, we have no information from the Barbary States, which\r\nmay enable us to prognosticate the success of our endeavors to effect\r\na peace in that quarter. Present me respectfully and affectionately to\r\nDr. Franklin, and accept assurances of the esteem with which I am, dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you, was of the 11th of October. Soon after that,\r\nyour favor of the 12th September came to hand. My acknowledgment of\r\nthis is made later than it should have been, by my trip to England.\r\nYour long silence I ascribe to a more pleasing cause, that of devoting\r\nyour spare time to one more capable of filling it with happiness, and\r\nto whom, as well as to yourself, I wish all those precious blessings\r\nwhich this change of condition is calculated to give you.\r\n\r\nMy public letters to Mr. Jay will have apprised you of my journey\r\nto England, and of its motives; and the joint letters of Mr. Adams\r\nand myself, of its effects. With respect to Portugal, it produced\r\narrangements; with respect to England and Barbary, only information.\r\nI am quite at a loss what you will do with England. To leave her in\r\npossession of our posts, seems inadmissible; and yet to take them,\r\nbrings on a state of things for which we seem not to be in readiness.\r\nPerhaps a total suppression of her trade, or an exclusion of her\r\nvessels from the carriage of our produce, may have some effect; but\r\nI believe not very great. Their passions are too deeply and too\r\nuniversally engaged in opposition to us. The ministry have found\r\nmeans to persuade the nation, that they are richer than they were\r\nwhile we participated of their commercial privileges. We should try\r\nto turn our trade into other channels. I am in hopes this country will\r\nendeavor to give it more encouragement. But what will you do with the\r\npiratical States? Buy a peace at their enormous price; force one; or\r\nabandon the carriage into the Mediterranean to other powers? All these\r\nmeasures are disagreeable. The decision rests with you. The Emperor is\r\nnow pressing a treaty with us. In a commercial view, I doubt whether\r\nit is desirable; but in a political one, I believe it is. He is now\r\nundoubtedly the second power in Europe, and on the death of the King of\r\nPrussia, he becomes the first character. An alliance with him will give\r\nus respectability in Europe, which we have occasion for. Besides, he\r\nwill be at the head of the second grand confederacy of Europe, and may,\r\nat any time, serve us with the powers constituting that. I am pressed\r\non so many hands to recommend Dumas to the patronage of Congress,\r\nthat I cannot avoid it. Everybody speaks well of him, and his zeal\r\nin our cause. Anything done for him will gratify this court, and the\r\npatriotic party in Holland, as well as some distinguished individuals.\r\nI am induced, from my own feelings, to recommend Colonel Humphreys to\r\nyour care. He is sensible, prudent, and honest, and may be very firmly\r\nrelied on, in any office which requires these talents. I pray you to\r\naccept assurances of the sincere esteem and respect with which I am,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. OTTO.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My absence in England, for some time past, has prevented my\r\nacknowledging so soon as I should have done, the receipt of your favor\r\nof January 15. In that you speak of having written other letters, but\r\nno other has ever come to my hands. I thank you for the intelligence\r\nthat contained, several articles of which never came to me through any\r\nother channel. On this side of the water everything is quiet. But the\r\ndeath of the King of Prussia is daily expected, and I think it very\r\npossible this event may bring on a disturbance of the peace of Europe,\r\nas the elastic spirit of the Emperor will feel itself restrained by\r\none pressure the less. This possibility excepted, Europe never had a\r\nmore pacific appearance. Among the Dutch, the republican party seems\r\nto be quite triumphant. The misunderstanding between Spain and Naples\r\ncannot produce any immediate consequences; and that between France and\r\nPortugal, we are told, is amicably settled. It is said that the Elector\r\nof Bavaria is in an ill state of health. His death, with that of the\r\nKing of Prussia, would hazard the tranquillity of Europe. I have not\r\nheard from the Chevalier de La Luzerne since my return. Count Adhemer\r\nis again in England. A change in the ministry here is more talked of\r\nand expected than at any time since my coming to this place. It is\r\nsaid the Baron de Breteuil will go out; that M. de Calonnes will be\r\ntransferred to this place, and a Monsieur Maillan succeed him. But the\r\npublic know too little and talk too much of these things to command our\r\nbelief. The marriage of the Swedish ambassador with the daughter of Mr.\r\nNeckar, you have known long ago. The Cardinal de Rohan and Cagliotho\r\nremain where they did, in the Bastile; nor does their affairs seem\r\nas yet to draw towards a conclusion. It has been a curious matter,\r\nin which the circumstances of intrigue and detail have busied all\r\nthe tongues, the public liberty none. I have been laboring with the\r\nministry to get the trade between this country and the United States\r\nput on a better footing, by admitting a free importation and sale of\r\nour produce, assuring them that we should take their manufactures at\r\nwhatever extent they would enable us to pay for them. The importation\r\nof our whale oil is, by the successful endeavors of M. de La Fayette,\r\nput on a good footing for this year. Mine, for emancipating the tobacco\r\ntrade, have been less successful. I still continue to stir, however,\r\nthis and all other articles. I think myself happy in the prospect of a\r\ncorrespondence with you, and am with sincere respect and esteem, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My stay in London having been considerably longer than I had\r\nexpected, I did not arrive in this place till the last day of April.\r\nI found here your kind letter of the 4th of that month, acknowledging,\r\nmuch more than they deserved, my little attentions to you. Their only\r\nmerit was their being faithful testimonies of a sincere regard for\r\nyou. The obligations have, in fact, been on my side, and I shall ever\r\nconsider it as such. I sincerely wish that on your arrival in America,\r\nyour own preference may be gratified by an appointment on that side\r\nof the water, to which your inclinations lead you. I have received\r\nthe books and papers you mention, and will undertake to have finished\r\nwhat you left undone of the medals, or at least will proceed in it,\r\ntill the matter shall be put into better hands. My principal object in\r\nmy journey to London was accomplished by arrangements with Portugal.\r\nThey are almost exactly in the terms of those with Prussia; except\r\nthat the general license to trade is restrained to those places where\r\nany foreign nation is admitted. The Tripoline offered peace for 30,000\r\nguineas for Tripoli, and as many for Tunis. Calculating on this scale,\r\nMorocco should ask 60,000, and Algiers 120,000. England declines all\r\narrangements with us. They say their commerce is so necessary to us,\r\nthat we shall not deny it to ourselves for the sake of the carrying\r\nbusiness, as the only trade they leave us is that with Great Britain\r\nimmediately, and that is a losing one. I hope we shall show them we\r\nhave sense and spirit enough to suppress that, or at least to exclude\r\nthem from any share in the carriage of our commodities. Their spirit\r\ntowards us is deeply hostile, and they seem as if they did not fear\r\na war with us. Should such an event become necessary, we have need\r\nof but only one resolution to place us on sure ground. That is, to\r\nabandon that element where they are strong and we nothing; and to\r\ndecide the contest on terra firma, where we have all to gain, and can\r\nlose nothing. The death of the King of Prussia is constantly expected.\r\nPerhaps that event may bring on a general broil. I am too lately\r\nreturned here to be able to give you any of the news of the place.\r\nI shall hope to hear from you soon and often, and am, with sincere\r\nesteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES ROSS.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 8, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your favor of October the 22d,\r\nand am much gratified by the communications therein made. It has\r\ngiven me details, which do not enter into the views of my ordinary\r\ncorrespondents, and which are very entertaining. I experience\r\ngreat satisfaction at seeing my country proceed to facilitate the\r\nintercommunications of its several parts, by opening rivers, canals and\r\nroads. How much more rational is this disposal of public money, than\r\nthat of waging war.\r\n\r\nBefore the receipt of your letter, Morris's contract for sixty thousand\r\nhogsheads of tobacco was concluded with the Farmers General. I have\r\nbeen for some time occupied in endeavoring to destroy the root of the\r\nevils, which the tobacco trade encounters in this country, by making\r\nthe ministers sensible, that merchants will not bring a commodity to\r\na market, where but one person is allowed to buy it; and that so long\r\nas that single purchaser is obliged to go to foreign markets for it,\r\nhe must pay for it in coin, and not in commodities. These truths have\r\nmade their way to the minds of the ministry, insomuch, as to have\r\ndelayed the execution of the new lease of the Farms, six months. It is\r\nrenewed, however, for three years, but so as not to render impossible\r\na reformation of this great evil. They are sensible of the evil, but it\r\nis so interwoven with their fiscal system, that they find it hazardous\r\nto disentangle. The temporary distress, too, of the revenue, they are\r\nnot prepared to meet. My hopes, therefore, are weak, though not quite\r\ndesperate. When they become so, it will remain to look about for the\r\nbest palliative this monopoly can bear. My present idea is, that it\r\nwill be found in a prohibition to the Farmers General, to purchase\r\ntobacco anywhere but in France. You will perceive by this, that my\r\nobject is to strengthen the connection between this country and my\r\nown, in all useful points. I am of opinion that twenty-three thousand\r\nhogsheads of tobacco, the annual consumption of this country, do not\r\nexceed the amount of those commodities which it is more advantageous\r\nto us to buy here than in England, or elsewhere; and such a commerce\r\nwould powerfully reinforce the motives for a friendship from this\r\ncountry towards ours. This friendship we ought to cultivate closely,\r\nconsidering the present dispositions of England towards us.\r\n\r\nI am lately returned from a visit to that country. The spirit of\r\nhostility to us has always existed in the mind of the King, but it\r\nhas now extended itself through the whole mass of the people, and the\r\nmajority in the public councils. In a country, where the voice of the\r\npeople influence so much the measures of administration, and where it\r\ncoincides with the private temper of the King, there is no pronouncing\r\non future events. It is true they have nothing to gain, and much to\r\nlose by a war with us. But interest is not the strongest passion in\r\nthe human breast. There are difficult points, too, still unsettled\r\nbetween us. They have not withdrawn their armies out of our country,\r\nnor given satisfaction for the property they brought off. On our part,\r\nwe have not paid our debts, and it will take time to pay them. In\r\nconferences with some distinguished mercantile characters, I found them\r\nsensible of the impossibility of our paying these debts at once, and\r\nthat an endeavor to force universal and immediate payment, would render\r\ndebts desperate, which are good in themselves. I think we should not\r\nhave differed in the term necessary. We differed essentially in the\r\narticle of interest. For while the principal, and interest preceding\r\nand subsequent to the war, seem justly due from us, that which accrued\r\nduring the war does not. Interest is a compensation for the use of\r\nmoney. Their money, in our hands, was in the form of lands and negroes.\r\nTobacco, the produce of these lands and negroes (or as I may call it,\r\nthe interest of them), being almost impossible of conveyance to the\r\nmarkets of consumption, because taken by themselves in its way there,\r\nsold during the war, at five or six shillings the hundred. This did not\r\npay taxes, and for tools and other plantation charges. A man who should\r\nhave attempted to remit to his creditor tobacco, for either principal\r\nor interest, must have remitted it three times before one cargo would\r\nhave arrived safe; and this from the depredations of their own nation,\r\nand often of the creditor himself; for some of the merchants entered\r\ndeeply into the privateering business. The individuals, who did not,\r\nsay they have lost this interest; the debtor replies, that he has not\r\ngained it, and that it is a case, where a loss having been incurred,\r\nevery one tries to shift it from himself. The known bias of the human\r\nmind from motives of interest should lessen the confidence of each\r\nparty in the justice of their reasoning; but it is difficult to say,\r\nwhich of them should make the sacrifice, both of reason and interest.\r\nOur conferences were intended as preparatory to some arrangement.\r\nIt is uncertain how far we should have been able to accommodate our\r\nopinions. But the absolute aversion of the government to enter into\r\nany arrangement prevented the object from being pursued. Each country\r\nis left to do justice to itself and to the other, according to its own\r\nideas, as to what is past; and to scramble for the future, as well\r\nas they can; to regulate their commerce by duties and prohibitions,\r\nand perhaps by cannons and mortars; in which event, we must abandon\r\nthe ocean, where we are weak, leaving to neutral nations the carriage\r\nof our commodities; and measure with them on land, where they alone\r\ncan lose. Farewell, then, all our useful improvements of canals and\r\nroads, reformations of laws, and other rational employments. I really\r\ndoubt whether there is temper enough, on either side, to prevent\r\nthis issue of our present hatred. Europe is, at this moment, without\r\nthe appearance of a cloud. The death of the King of Prussia, daily\r\nexpected, may raise one. My paper admonishes me, that after asking\r\na continuance of your favors, it is time for me to conclude with\r\nassurances of the esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. PLEASANTS.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, May 8, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--At the time of the receipt of your favor of October the\r\n24th, the contract between the Farmers General and Mr. Morris, for\r\ntobacco, was concluded, and in a course of execution. There was no\r\nroom, therefore, to offer the proposals which accompanied your letter.\r\nI was moreover engaged in endeavors to have the monopoly, in the\r\npurchase of this article, in this country, suppressed. My hopes on\r\nthat subject are not desperate, but neither are they flattering. I\r\nconsider it as the most effectual means of procuring the full value\r\nof our produce, of diverting our demands for manufactures from Great\r\nBritain to this country to a certain amount, and of thus producing some\r\nequilibrium in our commerce, which, at present, lies all in the British\r\nscale. It would cement an union with our friends, and lessen the\r\ntorrent of wealth which we are pouring into the laps of our enemies.\r\nFor my part, I think that the trade with Great Britain is a ruinous\r\none to ourselves; and that nothing would be an inducement to tolerate\r\nit, but a free commerce with their West Indies; and that this being\r\ndenied to us, we should put a stop to the losing branch. The question\r\nis, whether they are right in their prognostications that we have\r\nneither resolution nor union enough for this. Everything I hear from\r\nmy own country, fills me with despair as to their recovery from their\r\nvassalage to Great Britain. Fashion and folly are plunging them deeper\r\nand deeper into distress; and the legislators of the country becoming\r\ndebtors also, there seems no hope of applying the only possible remedy,\r\nthat of an immediate judgment and execution. We should try whether the\r\nprodigal might not be restrained from taking on credit the gewgaw held\r\nout to him in one hand, by seeing the keys of a prison in the other. Be\r\npleased to present my respects to Mrs. Pleasants, and to be assured of\r\nthe esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, May 10, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of January the 27th. Since that I have\r\nreceived yours of January the 19th. Information from other quarters\r\ngives me reason to suspect you have in negotiation a very important\r\nchange in your situation. You will carry into its execution all\r\nmy wishes for your happiness. I hope it will not detach you from a\r\nsettlement in your own country. I had even entertained hopes of your\r\nsettling in my neighborhood, but these were determined by your desiring\r\na plan of a house for Richmond. However reluctantly I relinquish this\r\nprospect, I shall not the less readily obey your commands by sending\r\nyou a plan. Having been much engaged since my return from England in\r\nanswering letters and despatching other business which had accumulated\r\nduring my absence, and being still much engaged, perhaps I may not be\r\nable to send the plan by this conveyance. If I do not send it now,\r\nI will surely by the next conveyance after this. Your Encyclopedie,\r\ncontaining eighteen livraisons, went off last night for Havre, from\r\nwhence it will go in a vessel bound to New York. It will be under the\r\ncare of M. La Croix, a passenger, who, if he does not find you in New\r\nYork, will carry it to Virginia, and send it to Richmond. Another copy,\r\nin a separate box, goes for Currie. I pay here all charges to New York.\r\nWhat may occur afterwards, I desire him to ask either of you or Currie,\r\nas either will pay for the other, or to draw on me for them.\r\n\r\nMy letters to Mr. Jay will have informed you of the objects which\r\ncarried me to England; and that the principal one, the treaty with\r\nPortugal, has been accomplished. Though we were unable to procure any\r\nspecial advantages in that, yet we thought it of consequence to insure\r\nour trade against those particular checks and discouragements which\r\nit has heretofore met with there. The information as to the Barbary\r\nStates, which we obtained from Abdrahaman, the Tripoline ambassador,\r\nwas also given to Mr. Jay. If it be right, and the scale of proportion\r\nbetween those nations, which we had settled, be also right, eight times\r\nthe sum required by Tripoli will be necessary to accomplish a peace\r\nwith the whole, that is to say, about two hundred and forty thousand\r\nguineas. The continuance of this peace will depend on their idea of\r\nour power to enforce it, and on the life of the particular Dey, or\r\nother head of the government, with whom it is contracted. Congress\r\nwill, no doubt, weigh these circumstances against the expense, and\r\nprobable success of compelling a peace by arms. Count d'Estaing having\r\ncommunicated to me verbally some information as to an experiment\r\nformerly made by this country, I shall get him to put it into writing,\r\nand I will forward it to Congress, as it may aid them in their choice\r\nof measures. However, which plan is most eligible can only be known\r\nto yourselves, who are on the spot, and have under your view all the\r\ndifficulties of both. There is a third measure, that of abandoning the\r\nMediterranean carriage to other nations.\r\n\r\nWith respect to England, no arrangements can be taken. The merchants\r\nwere certainly disposed to have consented to accommodation as to the\r\narticle of debts. I was not certain, when I left England, that they\r\nwould relinquish the interest during the war. A letter received since,\r\nfrom the first character among the American merchants in Scotland,\r\nsatisfies me they would have relinquished it to insure the capital\r\nand residue of interest. Would to heaven all the States, therefore,\r\nwould settle a uniform plan. To open the courts to them, so that they\r\nmight obtain judgments; to divide the executions into so many equal\r\nannual instalments, as that the last might be paid in the year 1790;\r\nto have the payments in actual money; and, to include the capital, and\r\ninterest preceding and subsequent to the war, would give satisfaction\r\nto the world, and to the merchants in general. Since it is left for\r\neach nation to pursue their own measures in the execution of the late\r\ntreaty, may not Congress with propriety recommend a mode of executing\r\nthat article respecting the debts, and send it to each State to be\r\npassed into law. Whether England gives up the posts or not, these debts\r\nmust be paid, or our character stained with infamy among all nations\r\nand through all time. As to the satisfaction for slaves carried off,\r\nit is a bagatelle, which, if not made good before the last instalment\r\nbecomes due, may be secured out of that.\r\n\r\nI formerly communicated the overtures for a treaty which had been\r\nmade by the imperial ambassador. The instructions from Congress being\r\nin their favor, and Mr. Adams' opinion also, I encouraged them.\r\nHe expected his full powers when I went to England. Yet I did not\r\nthink, nor did Mr. Adams, that this was of importance enough to weigh\r\nagainst the objects of that journey. He received them soon after my\r\ndeparture, and communicated it to me on my return, asking a copy of\r\nour propositions. I gave him one, but observed our commission had\r\nthen but a few days to run. He desired I should propose to Congress\r\nthe giving new powers to go on with this, and said, that in the\r\nmeantime he would arrange with us the plan. In a commercial view,\r\nno great good is to be gained by this; but in a political one, it\r\nmay be expedient. As the treaty would, of course, be in the terms of\r\nthose of Prussia and Portugal, it will give us but little additional\r\nembarrassment in any commercial regulations we may wish to establish.\r\nThe exceptions from these, which the other treaties will require, may\r\ntake in the treaty with the Emperor. I should be glad to communicate\r\nsome answer as soon as Congress shall have made up their minds on it.\r\nMy information to Congress on the subject of our commercial articles\r\nwith this country has only come down to January the 27th. Whether I\r\nshall say anything on it in my letter to Mr. Jay by this conveyance,\r\ndepends on its not being too early for an appointment I expect hourly\r\nfrom the Count de Vergennes, to meet him on this and other subjects. My\r\nlast information was, that the lease was too far advanced to withdraw\r\nfrom it the article of tobacco, but that a clause is inserted in it,\r\nempowering the King to discontinue it at any time. A discontinuance\r\nis, therefore, the only remaining object, and as even this cannot\r\nbe effected till the expiration of the old lease, which is about the\r\nend of the present year, I have wished only to stir the subject from\r\ntime to time, so as to keep it alive. This idea led me into a measure\r\nproposed by the Marquis de La Fayette, whose return from Berlin found\r\nthe matter at that point, to which my former report to Congress had\r\nconducted it. I communicated to him what I had been engaged on, what\r\nwere my prospects, and my purpose of keeping the subject just open.\r\nHe offered his services with that zeal which commands them on every\r\noccasion respecting America. He suggested to me the meeting two or\r\nthree gentlemen, well acquainted with this business. We met. They urged\r\nme to propose to the Count de Vergennes, the appointing a committee\r\nto take the matter into consideration. I told them that decency would\r\nnot permit me to point out to the Count de Vergennes the mode by\r\nwhich he should conduct a negotiation, but that I would press again\r\nthe necessity of an arrangement, if, whilst that should be operating\r\non his mind, they would suggest the appointment of a committee. The\r\nMarquis offered his services for this purpose. The consequence was\r\nthe appointment of a committee, and the Marquis as a member of it. I\r\ncommunicated to him my papers. He collected other lights wherever he\r\ncould, and particularly from the gentlemen with whom we had before\r\nconcerted, and who had a good acquaintance with the subject. The\r\nMarquis became our champion in the committee, and two of its members,\r\nwho were of the corps of Farmers General, entered the lists on the\r\nother side. Each gave in memorials. The lease, indeed, was signed\r\nwhile I was gone to England, but the discussions were, and still are\r\ncontinued in the committee, from which we derive two advantages: first,\r\nthat of showing that the object is not to be relinquished; and second,\r\nthat of enlightening government as to its true interest. The Count\r\nde Vergennes is absolutely for it; but it is not in his department.\r\nCalonnes is his friend, and in this instance his principle seems to\r\nbe, _Amica veritas, sed magis amicus Plato_. An additional hope is\r\nfounded in the expectation of a change of the minister of finance.\r\nThe present one is under the absolute control of the Farmers General.\r\nThe committee's views have been somewhat different from mine. They\r\ndespair of a suppression of the Farm, and therefore wish to obtain\r\npalliatives, which would coincide with the particular good of this\r\ncountry. I think that so long as the monopoly in the sale is kept up,\r\nit is of no consequence to us how they modify the pill for their own\r\ninternal relief; but, on the contrary, the worse it remains, the more\r\nnecessary it will render a reformation. Any palliative would take\r\nfrom us all those arguments and friends, that would be satisfied with\r\naccommodation. The Marquis, though differing in opinion from me on this\r\npoint, has, however, adhered to my principle of absolute liberty or\r\nnothing. In this condition is the matter at this moment. Whether I say\r\nanything on the subject to Mr. Jay will depend on my interview with the\r\nCount de Vergennes. I doubt whether that will furnish anything worth\r\ncommunicating, and whether it will be in time. I therefore state thus\r\nmuch to you, that you may see the matter is not laid aside.\r\n\r\nI must beg leave to recommend Colonel Humphreys to your acquaintance\r\nand good offices. He is an excellent man, an able one, and in need of\r\nsome provision. Besides former applications to me in favor of Dumas,\r\nthe Rhingrave of Salm (the effective minister of the government of\r\nHolland, while their two ambassadors here are ostensible) who is\r\nconducting secret arrangements for them with this court, presses his\r\ninterests on us. It is evident the two governments make a point of\r\nit. You ask why they do not provide for him themselves? I am not able\r\nto answer the question, but by a conjecture that Dumas's particular\r\nambition prefers an appointment from us. I know all the difficulty of\r\nthis application which Congress has to encounter. I see the reasons\r\nagainst giving him the primary appointment at that court, and the\r\ndifficulty of his accommodating himself to a subordinate one. Yet I\r\nthink something must be done in it to gratify this court, of which we\r\nmust be always asking favors. In these countries, personal favors weigh\r\nmore than public interest. The minister who has asked a gratification\r\nfor Dumas, has embarked his own feelings and reputation in that demand.\r\nI do not think it was discreet by any means. But this reflection might,\r\nperhaps, aggravate a disappointment. I know not really what you can do;\r\nbut yet hope something will be done. Adieu, my dear Sir, and believe me\r\nto be yours, affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, May 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I do myself the honor of enclosing to you letters which came\r\nto hand last night, from Mr. Lambe, Mr. Carmichael and Mr. Barclay.\r\nBy these you will perceive that our peace is not to be purchased at\r\nAlgiers but at a price far beyond our powers. What that would be,\r\nindeed, Mr. Lambe does not say, nor probably does he know. But, as he\r\nknew our ultimatum, we are to suppose from his letter, that it would\r\nbe a price infinitely beyond that. A reference to Congress hereon\r\nseems to be necessary. Till that can be obtained, Mr. Lambe must be\r\nidle at Algiers, Carthagena, or elsewhere. Would he not be better\r\nemployed in going to Congress? They would be able to draw from him\r\nand Mr. Randall, the information necessary to determine what they will\r\ndo. And if they determine to negotiate, they can re-appoint the same,\r\nor appoint a new negotiator, according to the opinion they shall form\r\non their examination. I suggest this to you as my first thoughts; an\r\nultimate opinion should not be formed till we see Mr. Randall, who\r\nmay be shortly expected. In the meantime, should an opportunity occur,\r\nfavor me with your ideas hereon, that we may be maturing our opinions.\r\nI shall send copies of these three letters to Mr. Jay, by the packet\r\nwhich sails from L'Orient the first of next month.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. ST. VICTOUR AND BETTINGER.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, May 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--On my return from London, which was but a few days ago, I\r\nfound your letter of April 8th. I communicated it to the Marquis de La\r\nFayette, to whom, equally with myself, an attention to the purchase of\r\narms has been recommended by the State of Virginia. Before we can order\r\nthe receipt of the arms at Bordeaux, we are of opinion they should\r\npreviously go through all the examinations and proofs usually practised\r\nwith the King's arms. As the Marquis is best acquainted with the detail\r\nof these, I have asked and obtained his leave to refer you to him on\r\nthe subject. You will, therefore, be so good as to confer with him\r\nthereon. I have an opportunity of writing to the Governor of Virginia\r\nto-morrow, and I should be well pleased to be able to inform him what\r\nnumber of arms you have now ready to deliver, and what other numbers\r\nyou expect to deliver, with the epochs of delivery. If you could give\r\nme this information by the return of the bearer, at any time to-day, it\r\nwould much oblige, Gentlemen, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HONORABLE J. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, May 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The last letters I had the honor of addressing you from this\r\nplace were of the 2d and 27th of January. Those from London were of the\r\n12th of March, and 23d of April.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February, the Baron de Blome, minister plenipotentiary\r\nat this court from Denmark, informed me that he was instructed by\r\nhis court to give notice to the ministers from the United States,\r\nappointed to negotiate a treaty of commerce with them that the Baron\r\nde Waltersdorff, formerly commissioned by them for the same purpose,\r\nhad received another destination, which called him to the West\r\nIndies, that they were sensible of the advantages which would arise\r\nto the two countries from a commercial intercourse--that their ports\r\naccordingly were placed on a very free footing, as they supposed ours\r\nto be also--that they supposed the commerce on each part might be\r\nwell conducted under the actual arrangements, but that whenever any\r\ncircumstances should arise which would render particular stipulations\r\nmore eligible, they would be ready to concur with the United States\r\nin establishing them, being desirous of continuing on the terms of the\r\nstrictest harmony and friendship with them.\r\n\r\nIn my letter of Jan. 27th, I informed you of what had passed between\r\nthe Imperial Ambassador and Secretary of Embassy and myself, on the\r\nsubject of the treaty with their sovereign. The Ambassador was in\r\nhourly expectation of receiving his full powers when I was called\r\nto London. Though I had received Mr. Adams's opinion in favor of\r\nour proceeding in the treaty, yet it was neither his nor my opinion\r\nthat this object should overweigh those which called me to London. A\r\ntreaty with Portugal was more important, exclusive of what was to be\r\ndone with England and the States of Barbary. On my return to Paris,\r\nthe Secretary called on me to inform me the Ambassador had received\r\nhis full powers very soon after my departure, and was now ready to\r\nbegin on our arrangements; that he was sensible, however, that these\r\ncould not be settled before our commission would expire, but as he\r\nsupposed Congress would be willing to renew it, we might proceed to\r\nconfer together, leaving the effect of our conferences to rest on the\r\nevent of a removal of the commission. He asked, also, a draft of our\r\npropositions as a ground work to proceed on. I met with the Ambassador\r\na few days after. He said the same things in substance, and concluded\r\nby asking our propositions. I gave him a draught, which was a copy\r\nof what we had originally proposed to Denmark, with such alterations\r\nas had occurred, and been approved in our negotiations with Prussia,\r\nTuscany and Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letters of December 9th and January 18th, from O'Bryan,\r\nof February 24th, March 12th, 20th, 23d, 27th, 31st, April 8th and\r\n10th from Mr. Barclay, of March 29th from Mr. Lambe, and February 3d\r\nand April 12th from Mr. Carmichael, will put you in possession of my\r\nlatest intelligence of the affairs of Morocco and Algiers. You will\r\nperceive by them that Mr. Randall may be daily expected here. If the\r\npropositions to Algiers appear from his account to be as unhopeful\r\nas Mr. Lambe seems to consider them, it is not impossible that Mr.\r\nAdams and myself may think that, instead of remaining at Carthagena,\r\nas Mr. Lambe proposes, it will be better for him to proceed to\r\nCongress. Without occasioning any loss of time, this will offer the two\r\nadvantages of giving them all the information he may be possessed of,\r\nand of putting it in their power to appoint any negotiator they may\r\nthink proper, should they find negotiations still eligible. However,\r\nMr. Adams and myself shall have better grounds to decide on when we\r\nshall receive the information from Mr. Randall.\r\n\r\nColonel Humphreys carried you the London Gazette to the beginning of\r\nApril. I now enclose it from that to the present date, together with\r\nthe Gazette of France from February 3d, to May 12th. I have the honor\r\nto be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE MR. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, May 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The duty has been imposed on me of making the following\r\ncommunication to Congress. It is necessary for me previously to observe\r\nthat, though the government of the United Netherlands have both an\r\nordinary and an extraordinary ambassador here, yet the Patriotic party,\r\nnow decisively possessed of the powers of government, have sent hither\r\nthe Rhingrave de Salm, as possessing their plenary confidence, to treat\r\nwith this Court on some matters not yet made known to the public. His\r\ncharacter and credit accordingly are so well known here, that, passing\r\nby the regular ambassador, they are actually in negotiation with him.\r\nHe took occasion to speak with me to-day on the subject of Mr. Dumas.\r\nAfter saying much in his favor, he assured me that Congress could not\r\nso much oblige the Patriotic party as by naming Mr. Dumas to their\r\ndiplomatic appointment at the Hague; and, further, that should they\r\nhave anything interesting to do there, there was no other man who\r\ncould do it so effectually as Mr. Dumas. I wished to avoid flattering\r\nhis expectations, and therefore mentioned to him the resolution of\r\nCongress confining their diplomatic appointments to citizens of the\r\nUnited States. He seemed to admit they could not expect him to be made\r\nminister plenipotentiary, but asked if it would not be possible to give\r\nhim another character. I told him we were in the usage of appointing\r\nonly one character inferior to that of minister plenipotentiary,\r\nwhich was that of chargé des affaires. That I was far from presuming\r\nto say that could be obtained in the present case; but that one other\r\ndifficulty occurred to me in that moment. I observed that they had a\r\nminister plenipotentiary with Congress, and that Congress, naming for\r\ntheir Court only a chargé des affaires, might, perhaps, be considered\r\nas disrespectful, and might occasion the recall of their minister. He\r\nassured me it could not; nay, that it should not. We are, continued\r\nhe, but a party, and therefore cannot make a general declaration on\r\nthis subject; but we know how far we can undertake; and, if you please,\r\nthe members of our party shall go and make a declaration privately\r\nbefore the French ambassador at our Court, that nothing amiss shall\r\nbe conceived of it. I told him this would not be desired. He asked\r\nme if I thought Count de Vergennes' writing a second letter on this\r\nsubject would be of service. I told him not to suppose a repetition\r\nof his application could be material. My object in avoiding a second\r\nletter from the Count de Vergennes as well as the declaration before\r\nthe French ambassador, was that embarrassments might not be multiplied,\r\nif Congress should not think proper to comply with their request.\r\nHe concluded by desiring I would urge this matter to Congress. It\r\nseems certain that Mr. Dumas has rendered himself very useful to the\r\ngovernment of both France and Holland in the late negotiations. It was\r\nnatural, therefore, that these governments should provide for him. I\r\nknow not how it has happened that we are resorted to on the occasion,\r\nunless, perhaps, it is the particular wish of Mr. Dumas to receive this\r\nspecies of reward. Be this as it may, the reigning party in the United\r\nNetherlands, and the government of this country, commit themselves on\r\nthis application, and it becomes a matter of calculation, in which\r\ntheir favor and the occasions we may have for it, are to be weighed\r\nagainst the sacrifices the present application call for. To pronounce\r\non this would be beyond my province, which is merely that of being the\r\nchannel of communication. This being desired in form, I suppose it is\r\nmy duty to comply with.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, May 23, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Letters received both from Madrid and Algiers, while I was in\r\nLondon, having suggested that treaties with the States of Barbary\r\nwould be much facilitated by a previous one with the Ottoman porte, it\r\nwas agreed between Mr. Adams and myself, that, on my return, I should\r\nconsult on this subject the Count de Vergennes, whose long residence\r\nat Constantinople rendered him the best judge of its expediency.\r\nVarious circumstances have put it out of my power to consult him, till\r\nto-day. I stated to him the difficulties we were likely to meet with at\r\nAlgiers; and asked his opinion what would be the probable expense of a\r\ndiplomatic mission to Constantinople, and what its effect at Algiers.\r\nHe said that the expense would be very great, for that presents must\r\nbe made at that court, and every one would be gaping after them; and\r\nthat it would not procure us a peace at Algiers one penny the cheaper.\r\nHe observed that the Barbary States acknowledged a sort of vassalage\r\nto the Porte, and availed themselves of that relation, when anything\r\nwas to be gained by it; but that whenever it subjected them to a\r\ndemand from the Porte, they totally disregarded it; that money was the\r\nsole agent at Algiers, except so far as fear could be induced also.\r\nHe cited the present example of Spain, which, though having a treaty\r\nwith the Porte, would probably be obliged to buy a peace at Algiers,\r\nat the expense of upwards of six millions of livres. I told him we had\r\ncalculated from the demands and information of the Tripoline ambassador\r\nat London, that to make peace with the four Barbary States would cost\r\nus between two and three hundred thousand guineas, if bought with\r\nmoney. The sum did not seem to exceed his expectations. I mentioned\r\nto him that, considering the uncertainty of a peace, when bought,\r\nperhaps Congress might think it more eligible to establish a cruise\r\nof frigates in the Mediterranean, and even to blockade Algiers. He\r\nsupposed it would require ten vessels, great and small. I observed to\r\nhim that Monsieur de Massiac had formerly done it with five; he said\r\nit was true, but that vessels of relief would be necessary. I hinted\r\nto him that I thought the English capable of administering aid to the\r\nAlgerines. He seemed to think it impossible, on account of the scandal\r\nit would bring on them. I asked him what had occasioned the blockade\r\nby Monsieur de Massiac; he said an infraction of their treaty by the\r\nAlgerines.\r\n\r\nI had a good deal of conversation with him, also, on the situation\r\nof affairs between England and the United States; and particularly\r\non their refusal to deliver up our posts. I observed to him that the\r\nobstructions thrown in the way of the recovery of their debts were\r\nthe effect, and not the cause, as they pretended, of their refusal to\r\ndeliver up the posts; that the merchants interested in these debts,\r\nshowed a great disposition to make arrangements with us; that the\r\narticle of time we could certainly have settled, and probably that\r\nof the interest during the war; but that the minister, showing no\r\ndisposition to have these matters arranged, I thought it a sufficient\r\nproof that this was not the true cause of their retaining the posts.\r\nHe concurred as to the justice of our requiring time for the payment\r\nof our debts; said nothing which showed a difference of opinion as to\r\nthe article of interest, and seemed to believe fully that their object\r\nwas to divert the channel of the fur trade, before they delivered\r\nup the posts, and expressed a strong sense of the importance of that\r\ncommerce to us. I told him I really could not foresee what would be\r\nthe event of this detention; that the situation of the British funds,\r\nand the desire of their minister to begin to reduce the national debt,\r\nseemed to indicate that they could not wish a war. He thought so, but\r\nthat neither were we in a condition to go to war. I told him I was yet\r\nuninformed what Congress proposed to do on this subject, but that we\r\nshould certainly always count on the good offices of France, and I was\r\nsure that the offer of them would suffice to induce Great Britain to do\r\nus justice. He said that surely we might always count on the friendship\r\nof France. I added, that by the treaty of alliance, she was bound to\r\nguarantee our limits to us, as they should be established at the moment\r\nof peace. He said they were so, \"_mais qu'il nous etoit necessaire de\r\nles constater_.\" I told him there was no question what our boundaries\r\nwere; that the English themselves admitted they were clear beyond\r\nall question. I feared, however, to press this any further, lest a\r\nreciprocal question should be put to me, and therefore diverted the\r\nconversation to another object.\r\n\r\nThis is a sketch only of a conference which was long. I have endeavored\r\nto give the substance, and sometimes the expressions, where they were\r\nmaterial. I supposed it would be agreeable to Congress to have it\r\ncommunicated to them, in the present undecided state in which these\r\nsubjects are. I should add, that an explanation of the transaction of\r\nMonsieur de Massiac with the Algerines, before hinted at, will be found\r\nin the enclosed letter from the Count d'Estaing to me, wherein he gives\r\nalso his own opinion. The whole is submitted to Congress, as I conceive\r\nit my duty to furnish them with whatever information I can gather,\r\nwhich may throw any light on the subjects depending before them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COUNT DE VERGENNES.[117]\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, May 31, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with your Excellency's letter of yesterday,\r\nenclosing a copy of the Resolutions of the Committee on the subject of\r\ntobacco, and am bound to make my acknowledgments for this attention to\r\nthe commerce between this country and the United States, which will,\r\nI hope, by this measure, be kept alive till more simple and permanent\r\narrangements become practicable. I have communicated it to Congress by\r\nan opportunity which offered this morning. Perhaps it is for the want\r\nof information that I apprehend it possible for the London merchants,\r\navailing themselves of their early notice of this regulation, and\r\ntheir proximity to the port of France, to run in French vessels the\r\nwhole 15,000 hogsheads of the first year, before the French or American\r\nmerchants can possibly bring them from America. This might defeat the\r\nend of the regulation, as those merchants would take payment in cash\r\nand not in merchandise. I suppose the Committee had in view _Tobaccos\r\ncoming last from a port of the United States_, and that it may not\r\nbe yet too late to restrain the orders to such only. Of this your\r\nExcellency is the best judge, to whom I have the honor of submitting\r\nthe doubt; and am, with sentiments of the most profound respect and\r\nesteem, your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LA MORLIENE.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, June 3, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--It is six years since the paper money of New England has ceased\r\nto circulate as money. It is considered at present as making a part\r\nof the national debt, and that the holders of it will be entitled\r\nto receive from the public as much gold or silver as the paper money\r\ncould have brought at the time it was received by the holder, with an\r\ninterest of 6 per cent. per annum. But, as yet, no precise arrangements\r\nhave been taken for the payment either of principal or interest. Most\r\nof the subjects of France, having paper money, have deposited it in the\r\nhands of the French Minister or Council at New York, that payment may\r\nbe demanded whenever it shall be provided by Congress. There are even\r\nspeculators in America who will purchase it. But they give much less\r\nthan its worth. As for myself I do not deal in it. I am, Sir, your very\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. BUCHANAN AND HAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 15, 1786.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--The model of the Capitol being at length finished, I have\r\nsent it down the Seine to Havre, it being necessary that it should go\r\nby water. I have not collected the accounts, but shall soon do it, and\r\nforward them to you; they will be less than I had expected. I shall\r\npray you to account for their amount to the Governor and Council, as\r\nI have with them an account into which it will be easier for me to\r\ntransfer the article. I enclose directions for opening the boxes in\r\nwhich the model is, and I shall put two copies of those directions\r\nunder other covers to you in hopes some one of them may reach you\r\nwith or before the model. I have the honor to be with much esteem,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 15, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Monsieur Farrin called on me on the subject of making\r\nHonfleur a free port, and wished me to solicit it. I told him it was\r\nfor our interest, as for that also of all the world, that every port of\r\nFrance, and of every other country, should be free: that therefore we\r\nwould wish Honfleur to be made so: that if the matter was in agitation,\r\nthe Count de Vergennes would probably speak of it to me, in which case\r\nI should tell him with candor what I thought of it, but that I could\r\nnot solicit it, as I had no instructions to do so. So far I said to\r\nhim. I did not add, what I may safely do to you, that the measures\r\nproposed being more for the interest of France than of the United\r\nStates, there is no reason for our desiring its adoption to be placed\r\non the ground of favor to us; and again, that those who have had and\r\nwho may yet have occasion to ask great favors, should never ask small\r\nones. I have, therefore, thought it better that the United States\r\nshould not be engaged in this negotiation. If the government, for its\r\nown interest, will make the port free, I shall be glad of it; but do\r\nnot wish it enough to ask it. If you should be of a different opinion,\r\nI should be glad to converse with you on the subject. I write without\r\nreserve, knowing that you will be pleased with it; and that your zeal\r\nfor our interest will induce you to do what is for the best. I am, my\r\ndear Sir, yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 20, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of the 5th of May, by Baron Waltersdorff.\r\nSince that I have been honored with yours of April the 13th, and May\r\nthe 16th and 18th. The present covers letters to Mr. Lambe and Mr.\r\nRandall, informing them that the demands of Algiers for the ransom\r\nof our prisoners and also for peace are so infinitely beyond our\r\ninstructions, that we must refer the matter back to Congress, and\r\ntherefore praying them to come on immediately. I will beg the favor of\r\nyou to forward these letters. The whole of this business, therefore, is\r\nsuspended till we receive further orders, except as to Mr. Barclay's\r\nmission. Your bills have been received and honored. The first, naming\r\nexpressly a letter of advice, and none coming, it was refused till the\r\nreceipt of your letter to me, in which you mentioned that you had drawn\r\ntwo bills. I immediately informed Mr. Grand, who thereupon honored the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nI have received no public letters of late date. Through other channels,\r\nI have collected some articles of information, which may be acceptable\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a letter of March the 20th, from Dr. Franklin to me, is this\r\npassage: \"As to public affairs, the Congress has not been able to\r\nassemble more than seven or eight States during the whole winter,\r\nso the treaty with Prussia remains still unratified, though there is\r\nno doubt of its being done soon, as a full Congress is expected next\r\nmonth. The disposition to furnish Congress with ample powers augments\r\ndaily, as people become more enlightened. And I do not remember ever\r\nto have seen, during my long life, more signs of public felicity than\r\nappear at present throughout these States; the cultivators of the\r\nearth, who make the bulk of our nation, have made good crops, which are\r\npaid for at high prices, with ready money; the artisans too, receive\r\nhigh wages; and the value of all real estates is augmented greatly.\r\nMerchants and shopkeepers, indeed, complain that there is not business\r\nenough. But this is evidently not owing to the fewness of buyers,\r\nbut to the too great number of sellers; for the consumption of goods\r\nwas never greater, as appears by the dress, furniture, and manner of\r\nliving, of all ranks of the people.\" His health is good, except as to\r\nthe stone, which does not grow worse. I thank you for your attention\r\nto my request about the books, which Mr. Barclay writes me he has\r\nforwarded from Cadiz. I have the honor to be with great respect, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LAMBE.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, June 20, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Having communicated to Mr. Adams the information received at\r\ndifferent times, from yourself, from Mr. Randall and Mr. Carmichael,\r\nwe find that the sum likely to be demanded by Algiers for the ransom\r\nof our prisoners, as well as for peace, is so infinitely beyond our\r\npowers, and the expectations of Congress, that it has become our duty\r\nto refer the whole matter back to them. Whether they will choose to buy\r\na peace, to force one, or to do nothing, will rest in their pleasure.\r\nBut that they may have all the information possible to guide them in\r\ntheir deliberations, we think it important that you should return to\r\nthem. No time will be lost by this, and perhaps time may be gained. It\r\nis, therefore, our joint desire, that you repair immediately to New\r\nYork, for the purpose of giving to Congress all the information on\r\nthis subject which your journey has enabled you to acquire. You will\r\nconsider this request as coming from Mr. Adams as well as myself, as\r\nit is by express authority from him that I join him in it. I am of\r\nopinion it will be better for you to come to Marseilles and by Paris;\r\nbecause there is a possibility that fresh orders to us, from Congress,\r\nmight render it useful that we, also, should have received from you\r\nall possible information on this subject. And, perhaps, no time may be\r\nlost by this, as it might be long before you would get a passage from\r\nAlicant to America.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, July 8, 1786\r\n\r\nSIR,--My letters to you by the last French packet were dated May 12,\r\n22, 23, 27, 27, and I sent, by the way of London, one dated May 21.\r\nSince this, I have been honored with yours of May the 5th. The letter\r\ntherein enclosed for Mr. Dumas has been duly forwarded; and the report\r\non the subject of the Consular convention I delivered to Count de\r\nVergennes the first levee day after the return of the King, who was\r\ngone to Cherbourg at the time of my receiving it. Mr. Randall, being so\r\nfar on his return, and meaning to go by the way of London, where his\r\nstay will be short, he will be the bearer of this letter, with which\r\nI have an opportunity of enclosing the last letters I have received\r\nfrom Mr. Barclay and Mr. Lambe. Mr. Barclay left Cadiz soon after the\r\ndate of his letter. I wrote to Mr. Lambe on the 20th of June, with\r\nthe concurrence of Mr. Adams, to repair to Congress with all possible\r\ndespatch, recommending, but not enjoining, his coming by the way of\r\nVersailles and Paris, supposing it possible that the information he\r\nmight communicate might be usefully applied by Mr. Adams and myself\r\nin the execution of the commands of Congress. I afterwards wrote him\r\nanother letter, desiring expressly that if this route was likely to\r\nretard much his attendance on Congress, he would take such other as\r\nwould be shortest. At the desire of Monsieur Houdon, I have the honor\r\nto enclose to you his propositions for making the equestrian statue of\r\nGeneral Washington. In the autumn of the last year, I received letters\r\nfrom an American master of a ship of the name of Asquith, informing me\r\nthat he had had a most disastrous passage across the Atlantic, that\r\nthey had put into Brest then in such distress that they were obliged\r\nto make the first port possible, that they had been immediately seized\r\nby the officers of the Farmers General, their vessel and her lading\r\nseized, and that themselves were then in jail suffering from every\r\nwant. Letters by every post gave me to believe their distress was very\r\nreal. As all their cash was soon exhausted, and the winter setting in\r\nvery severely, I desired a merchant in Brest to furnish them a livre\r\na day a piece. It was sometime before I could ascertain the nature of\r\nthe proceedings against them. It proved at length to be a prosecution\r\nas for endeavoring to introduce tobacco in contraband. I was induced\r\nto order this allowance from evidence that the men, six in number,\r\nmust inevitably perish if left to the pittance allowed by the Farmers\r\nGeneral to their prisoners, and from a hope that the matter would soon\r\nbe decided. I was led on by this delusive hope from week to week,\r\nand month to month, and it proved to be ten months before they were\r\ndischarged. I applied early to Count de Vergennes, and was informed\r\nby him that the matter being in a regular course of law, there could\r\nbe no interference, and that if the sentence should be against them I\r\nmight expect a remission of so much of it as should depend on the King.\r\nThey were condemned to forfeit their vessel and cargo, to a fine, and\r\nto the gallies. The fine and condemnation to the gallies were remitted\r\nimmediately by the King, but the forfeiture of vessel and cargo being\r\nfor the benefit of the Farmers, he could not remit that. They were\r\nalso to pay the expenses of their prosecution, and to remain in jail\r\ntill they did it. So that, upon the whole, I was obliged to advance\r\nfor them 2620_l._ 2_s._, being somewhat upwards of 100 guineas; for\r\nwhich I informed Asquith, from the beginning, he must consider himself\r\nas answerable to the United States. I accordingly enclose the account\r\nshowing the purposes for which the money was paid, and his own original\r\nacknowledgment that it was for his use. I own I am uncertain whether\r\nI have done right in this; but I am persuaded some of them would have\r\nperished without this advance; I therefore thought it one of those\r\ncases where citizens, being under unexpected calamity, have a right to\r\ncall for the patronage of the public servants. All the disinterested\r\ntestimony I have been able to get has been in favor of the innocence\r\nof these men. Count de Vergennes, however, believed them guilty; and\r\nI was assured the depositions regularly taken were much against them.\r\nI enclose herewith the state of their case as it appeared to me in the\r\nbeginning, and as I communicated it by letter to the minister.\r\n\r\nHaving been lately desired by the Swedish Ambassador here, to state\r\nto him what I thought the best measure for rendering the island of St.\r\nBartholomew useful to the commerce of Sweden and the United States, I\r\ndid it in a letter of which I enclose a copy. My view in doing it is,\r\nthat if any farther or better measure should occur to Congress, on its\r\nbeing communicated to me, I can still suggest it to the Ambassador,\r\nprobably before any final decision.\r\n\r\nIt being material that the reduction of the duties on whale oil, which\r\nwould expire with the close of this year, should be revised in time\r\nfor the whalemen to take measures in consequence, we have applied\r\nfor a continuance of the reduction, and even for an abolition of all\r\nduties. The committee, of the creation of which I informed you in my\r\nletter of May 27, and of which the M. de La Fayette is a member, were\r\nin favor of the abolition. But there is little prospect, perhaps none\r\nat all, of obtaining confirmation of their sentence. I have no doubt of\r\nthe continuance of the abatement of the duties on the footing stated\r\nin that letter. The term of three years will probably be adopted. The\r\ngazettes of Leyden and of France, from the former to the present date,\r\naccompany this. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most\r\nperfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, July 9, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 23d of May. Your favor of that\r\ndate did not come to hand till the 19th of June. In consequence of it\r\nI wrote the next day letters to Mr. Lambe and Mr. Randall, copies of\r\nwhich I have now the honor to enclose you. In these, you will perceive\r\nI had desired Mr. Randall, who was supposed to be at Madrid, to return\r\nimmediately to Paris and London, and to Mr. Lambe, supposed at Alicant,\r\nI recommended the route of Marseilles and Paris, expecting that no\r\ndirect passage could be had from Alicant to America, and meaning,\r\non his arrival here, to advise him to proceed by the way of London,\r\nthat you also might have an opportunity of deriving from him all the\r\ninformation he could give. On the 2d of July, Mr. Randall arrived here,\r\nand delivered me a letter from Mr. Lambe, dated May the 20th, of which\r\nI enclose you a copy, as well as of another of June the 5th, which\r\nhad come to hand some time before. Copies of these I have also sent\r\nto Mr. Jay. Yours of the 29th of June, by Dr. Bancroft, and enclosing\r\na draught of a joint letter to Mr. Lambe, came to hand on the 5th\r\ninstant. I immediately signed and forwarded it, as it left him more at\r\nliberty as to his route than mine had done. Mr. Randall will deliver\r\nyou the present and supply the informations heretofore received. I\r\nthink with you that Congress must begin by getting money. When they\r\nhave this, it is a matter of calculation whether they will buy a peace,\r\nor force one, or do nothing. I am also to acknowledge the receipt of\r\nyour favors of June 6, 25 and 26. The case of Grosse shall be attended\r\nto. I am not certain, however, whether my appearing in it may not do\r\nhim harm by giving the captors a hope that our government will redeem\r\ntheir citizens. I have, therefore, taken measures to find them out\r\nand sound them. If nothing can be done privately, I will endeavor to\r\ninterest this government.\r\n\r\nHave you no news yet of the treaty with Portugal? does it hang with\r\nthat court? My letters from New York of the 11th of May inform me\r\nthat there were then eleven States present, and that they should\r\nratify the Prussian treaty immediately. As the time for the exchange\r\nof ratifications is drawing to a close, tell me what is to be done,\r\nand how this exchange is to be made. We may as well have this settled\r\nbetween us before the arrival of the ratification, that no time may\r\nbe lost after that. I learn through the Marechal de Castries that he\r\nhas information of New York's having ceded the impost in the form\r\ndesired by Congress, so as to close this business. Corrections in\r\nthe acts of Maryland, Pennsylvania, &c., will come of course. We\r\nhave taken up again the subject of whale oil, that they may know in\r\ntime in America what is to be done in it. I fear we shall not obtain\r\nany farther abatement of duties; but the last abatement will be\r\ncontinued for three years. The whole duties payable here are nearly\r\none hundred and two livres on the English ton, which is an atom more\r\nthan four guineas, according to the present exchange. The monopoly of\r\nthe purchase of tobacco for this country, which had been obtained by\r\nRobert Morris, had thrown the commerce of that article in agonies. He\r\nhad been able to reduce the price in America from 40 to 22_l._ lawful\r\nthe hundred weight, and all other merchants being deprived of that\r\nmedium of remittance, the commerce between American and that country,\r\nso far as it depended on that article, which was very capitally too,\r\nwas absolutely ceasing. An order has been obtained, obliging the\r\nFarmers General to purchase from such other merchants as shall offer\r\nfifteen thousand hogsheads of tobacco at thirty-four, thirty-six and\r\nthirty-eight livres the hundred, according to the quality, and to grant\r\nto the sellers in other respects the same terms as they had granted\r\nto Robert Morris. As this agreement with Morris is the basis of this\r\norder, I send you some copies of it, which I will thank you to give to\r\nany American (not British) merchants in London who may be in that line.\r\nSeeing the year this contract has subsided, Virginia and Maryland have\r\nlost £400,000 by the reduction of the price of their tobacco.\r\n\r\nI am meditating what step to take to provoke a letter from Mrs. Adams,\r\nfrom whom my files inform me I have not received one these hundred\r\nyears. In the meantime, present my affectionate respects to her, and be\r\nassured of the friendship and esteem with which I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, July 9, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 10th of May; since which your favor\r\nof May the 11th has come to hand. The political world enjoys great\r\nquiet here. The King of Prussia is still living, but like the snuff\r\nof a candle, which sometimes seems out, and then blazes up again. Some\r\nthink that his death will not produce any immediate effect in Europe.\r\nHis kingdom, like a machine, will go on for some time with the winding\r\nup he has given it. The King's visit to Cherbourg has made a great\r\nsensation in England and here. It proves to the world, that it is a\r\nserious object to this country, and that the King commits himself for\r\nthe accomplishment of it. Indeed, so many cones have been sunk, that no\r\ndoubt remains of the practicability of it. It will contain, as is said,\r\neighty ships of the line, be one of the best harbors in the world, and\r\nby means of two entrances, on different sides, will admit vessels to\r\ncome in and go out with every wind. The effect of this, in another war\r\nwith England, defies calculation. Having no news to communicate, I will\r\nrecur to the subjects of your letter of May the 11th.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the new States, were the question to stand simply in\r\nthis form, How may the ultramontane territory be disposed of, so as to\r\nproduce the greatest and most immediate benefit to the inhabitants of\r\nthe maritime States of the Union? the plan would be more plausible,\r\nof laying it off into two or three States only. Even on this view,\r\nhowever, there would still be something to be said against it, which\r\nmight render it at least doubtful. But that is a question which good\r\nfaith forbids us to receive into discussion. This requires us to state\r\nthe question in its just form, How may the territories of the Union\r\nbe disposed of, so as to produce the greatest degree of happiness\r\nto their inhabitants? With respect to the maritime States, little or\r\nnothing remains to be done. With respect, then, to the ultramontane\r\nStates, will their inhabitants be happiest, divided into States of\r\nthirty-thousand square miles, not quite as large as Pennsylvania, or\r\ninto States of one hundred and sixty thousand square miles, each, that\r\nis to say, three times as large as Virginia within the Alleghany? They\r\nwill not only be happier in States of moderate size, but it is the\r\nonly way in which they can exist as a regular society. Considering the\r\nAmerican character in general, that of those people particularly, and\r\nthe energetic nature of our governments, a State of such extent as one\r\nhundred and sixty thousand square miles, would soon crumble into little\r\nones. These are the circumstances which reduce the Indians to such\r\nsmall societies. They would produce an effect on our people, similar\r\nto this. They would not be broken into such small pieces, because they\r\nare more habituated to subordination, and value more a government of\r\nregular law. But you would surely reverse the nature of things, in\r\nmaking small States on the ocean, and large ones beyond the mountains.\r\nIf we could, in our consciences, say, that great States beyond the\r\nmountains will make the people happiest, we must still ask, whether\r\nthey will be contented to be laid off into large States? They certainly\r\nwill not; and, if they decide to divide themselves, we are not able\r\nto restrain them. They will end by separating from our confederacy,\r\nand becoming its enemies. We had better, then, look forward, and see\r\nwhat will be the probable course of things. This will surely be a\r\ndivision of that country into States of a small, or, at most, of a\r\nmoderate size. If we lay them off into such, they will acquiesce; and\r\nwe shall have the advantage of arranging them, so as to produce the\r\nbest combinations of interest. What Congress have already done in this\r\nmatter is an argument the more in favor of the revolt of those States\r\nagainst a different arrangement, and of their acquiescence under a\r\ncontinuance of that. Upon this plan, we treat them as fellow citizens;\r\nthey will have a just share in their own government; they will love\r\nus, and pride themselves in an union with us. Upon the other, we treat\r\nthem as subjects; we govern them, and not they themselves; they will\r\nabhor us as masters, and break off from us in defiance. I confess to\r\nyou, that I can see no other turn that these two plans would take. But\r\nI respect your opinion, and your knowledge of the country too much, to\r\nbe ever confident in my own.\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your communication, that my not having\r\nsooner given notice of the _Arrets_ relative to fish gave discontent\r\nto some persons. These are the most friendly offices you can do me,\r\nbecause they enable me to justify myself, if I am right, or correct\r\nmyself, if wrong. If those, who thought I might have been remiss,\r\nwould have written to me on the subject, I should have admired them\r\nfor their candor, and thanked them for it: for I have no jealousies\r\nnor resentments at things of this kind, where I have no reason to\r\nbelieve they have been excited by a hostile spirit; and I suspect\r\nno such spirit in a single member of Congress. You know there were\r\ntwo _Arrets_; the first of August the 30th, 1784, the second of the\r\n18th and 25th of September, 1785. As to the first, it would be a\r\nsufficient justification of myself to say, that it was in the time\r\nof my predecessor, nine months before I came into office, and that\r\nthere was no more reason for my giving information of it, when I did\r\ncome into office, than of all the other transactions which preceded\r\nthat period. But this would seem to lay a blame on Dr. Franklin, for\r\nnot communicating it, which I am confident he did not deserve. This\r\ngovernment affects a secrecy in all its transactions whatsoever, though\r\nthey be of a nature not to admit a perfect secrecy. Their _Arrets_,\r\nrespecting the islands, go to those islands, and are unpublished and\r\nunknown in France, except in the bureau where they are formed. That of\r\nAugust, 1784, would probably be communicated to the merchants of the\r\nseaport towns also. But Paris having no commercial connections with\r\nthem, if anything makes its way from a seaport town to Paris, it must\r\nbe by accident. We have, indeed, agents in these seaports; but they\r\nvalue their offices so little, that they do not trouble themselves to\r\ninform us of what is passing there. As a proof that these things do\r\nnot transpire here, nor are easily got at, recollect that Mr. Adams,\r\nDr. Franklin, and myself were all here, on the spot together, from\r\nAugust, 1784, to June, 1785, that is to say, ten months, and yet not\r\none of us knew of the _Arret_ of August, 1784. September the 18th and\r\n25th, 1785, the second was passed. And here alone I became responsible.\r\nI think it was about six weeks before I got notice of it, that is, in\r\nNovember. On the 20th of that month, writing to Count de Vergennes on\r\nanother subject, I took occasion to remonstrate to him on that. But\r\nfrom early in November, when the Fitzhughs went to America, I had\r\nnever a confidential opportunity of writing to Mr. Jay from hence,\r\ndirectly, for several months. In a letter of December the 14th to Mr.\r\nJay, I mentioned to him the want of an opportunity to write to him\r\nconfidentially, which obliged me, at that moment, to write by post, via\r\nLondon, and on such things only as both post offices were welcome to\r\nsee. On the 2d of January, Mr. Bingham setting out for London, I wrote\r\nto Mr. Jay, sending him a copy of my letter to Count de Vergennes, and\r\nstating something which had passed in conversation on the same subject.\r\nI prayed Mr. Bingham to take charge of the letter, and either to send\r\nit by a safe hand, or carry it himself, as circumstances should render\r\nmost advisable. I believe he kept it, to carry himself. He did not\r\nsail from London till about the 12th of March, nor arrived in America\r\ntill about the middle of May. Thus you see, that causes had prevented\r\na letter which I had written on the 20th of November from getting\r\nto America till the month of May. No wonder, then, if notice of this\r\n_Arret_ came first to you by way of the West Indies; and, in general,\r\nI am confident that you will receive notice of the regulations of this\r\ncountry, respecting their islands, by the way of those islands before\r\nyou will from hence. Nor can this be remedied, but by a system of\r\nbribery which would end in the corruption of your own ministers, and\r\nproduce no good adequate to the expense. Be so good as to communicate\r\nthese circumstances to the persons who you think may have supposed me\r\nguilty of remissness on this occasion.\r\n\r\nI will turn to a subject more pleasing to both, and give you my\r\nsincere congratulations on your marriage. Your own dispositions and the\r\ninherent comforts of that state, will insure you a great addition of\r\nhappiness. Long may you live to enjoy it, and enjoy it in full measure.\r\nThe interest I feel in every one connected with you, will justify my\r\npresenting my earliest respects to the lady, and of tendering her the\r\nhomage of my friendship. I shall be happy, at all times, to be useful\r\nto either of you, and to receive your commands. I enclose you the bill\r\nof lading of your Encyclopedie. With respect to the remittance of it,\r\nof which you make mention, I beg you not to think of it. I know, by\r\nexperience, that on proceeding to make a settlement in life, a man has\r\nneed of all his resources; and I should be unhappy were you to lessen\r\nthem, by an attention to this trifle. Let it be till you have nothing\r\nelse to do with your money. Adieu, my dear Sir, and be assured of the\r\nesteem with which I am, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, July 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Our instructions relative to the Barbary States having\r\nrequired us to proceed by way of negotiation to obtain their peace, it\r\nbecame our duty to do this to the best of our power. Whatever might be\r\nour private opinions, they were to be suppressed, and the line, marked\r\nout to us, was to be followed. It has been so, honestly and zealously.\r\nIt was, therefore, never material for us to consult together, on the\r\nbest plan of conduct towards these States. I acknowledge, I very early\r\nthought it would be best to effect a peace through the medium of war.\r\nThough it is a question with which we have nothing to do, yet as you\r\npropose some discussion of it, I shall trouble you with my reasons. Of\r\nthe four positions laid down in your letter of the 3d instant, I agree\r\nto the three first, which are, in substance, that the good offices of\r\nour friends cannot procure us a peace, without paying its price; that\r\nthey cannot materially lessen that price; and that paying it, we can\r\nhave the peace in spite of the intrigues of our enemies. As to the\r\nfourth, that the longer the negotiation is delayed, the larger will be\r\nthe demand; this will depend on the intermediate captures: if they are\r\nmany and rich, the price may be raised; if few and poor, it will be\r\nlessened. However, if it is decided that we shall buy a peace, I know\r\nno reason for delaying the operation, but should rather think it ought\r\nto be hastened; but I should prefer the obtaining it by war.\r\n\r\n1. Justice is in favor of this opinion. 2. Honor favors it. 3. It will\r\nprocure us respect in Europe; and respect is a safeguard to interest.\r\n4. It will arm the federal head with the safest of all the instruments\r\nof coercion over its delinquent members, and prevent it from using what\r\nwould be less safe. I think that so far, you go with me. But in the\r\nnext steps, we shall differ. 5. I think it least expensive. 6. Equally\r\neffectual. I ask a fleet of one hundred and fifty guns, the one-half\r\nof which shall be in constant cruise. This fleet, built, manned and\r\nvictualled for six months will cost four hundred and fifty thousand\r\npounds sterling. Its annual expense will be three hundred pounds\r\nsterling a gun, including everything; this will be forty-five thousand\r\npounds sterling a year. I take British experience for the basis of\r\nmy calculation: though we know, from our own experience, that we can\r\ndo in this way, for pounds lawful, what costs them pounds sterling.\r\nWere we to charge all this to the Algerine war, it would amount to\r\nlittle more than we must pay, if we buy peace. But as is it proper and\r\nnecessary that we should establish a small marine force, (even were we\r\nto buy a peace from the Algerines,) and as that force, laid up in our\r\ndock-yards, would cost us half as much annually, as if kept in order\r\nfor service, we have a right to say that only twenty-two thousand\r\nand five hundred pounds sterling, per annum, should be charged to the\r\nAlgerine war. 6. It will be as effectual. To all the mismanagements\r\nof Spain and Portugal, urged to show that war against those people is\r\nineffectual, I urge a single fact to prove the contrary, where there\r\nis any management. About forty years ago, the Algerines having broke\r\ntheir treaty with France, this court sent Monsieur de Massiac, with\r\none large, and two small frigates; he blockaded the harbor of Algiers\r\nthree months, and they subscribed to the terms he proposed. If it be\r\nadmitted, however, that war, on the fairest prospects, is still exposed\r\nto uncertainties, I weigh against this, the greater uncertainty of\r\nthe duration of a peace bought with money, from such a people, from a\r\nDey eighty years old, and by a nation who, on the hypothesis of buying\r\npeace, is to have no power on the sea, to enforce an observance of it.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have gone on the supposition that the whole weight of this\r\nwar would rest on us. But, 1. Naples will join us. The character\r\nof their naval minister (Acton), his known sentiments with respect\r\nto the peace Spain is officiously trying to make for them, and his\r\ndispositions against the Algerines, give the best grounds to believe\r\nit. 2. Every principle of reason assures us that Portugal will join us.\r\nI state this as taking for granted, what all seem to believe, that they\r\nwill not be at peace with Algiers. I suppose, then, that a convention\r\nmight be formed between Portugal, Naples and the United States, by\r\nwhich the burthen of the war might be quotaed on them, according to\r\ntheir respective wealth; and the term of it should be, when Algiers\r\nshould subscribe to a peace with all three, on equal terms. This might\r\nbe left open for other nations to accede to, and many, if not most of\r\nthe powers of Europe, (except France, England, Holland, and Spain, if\r\nher peace be made) would sooner or later enter into the confederacy,\r\nfor the sake of having their peace with the piratical States guaranteed\r\nby the whole. I suppose, that, in this case, our proportion of force\r\nwould not be the half of what I first calculated on.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons which have influenced my judgment on this\r\nquestion. I give them to you, to show you that I am imposed on by a\r\nsemblance of reason, at least; and not with an expectation of their\r\nchanging your opinion. You have viewed the subject, I am sure, in\r\nall its bearings. You have weighed both questions, with all their\r\ncircumstances. You make the result different from what I do. The same\r\nfacts impress us differently. This is enough to make me suspect an\r\nerror in my process of reasoning, though I am not able to detect it. It\r\nis of no consequence; as I have nothing to say in the decision, and am\r\nready to proceed heartily on any other plan which may be adopted, if\r\nmy agency should be thought useful. With respect to the dispositions\r\nof the State, I am utterly uninformed. I cannot help thinking, however,\r\nthat on a view of all the circumstances, they might be united in either\r\nof the plans.\r\n\r\nHaving written this on the receipt of your letter, without knowing\r\nof any opportunity of sending it, I know not when it will go; I add\r\nnothing, therefore, on any other subject, but assurances of the sincere\r\nesteem and respect with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COMMODORE JONES.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, July 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am perfectly ready to transmit to America any accounts or\r\nproofs you may think proper. Nobody can wish more that justice be done\r\nyou, nor is more ready to be instrumental in doing whatever may insure\r\nit. It is only necessary for me to avoid the presumption of appearing\r\nto decide where I have no authority to do it. I will this evening lodge\r\nin the hands of Mr. Grand the original order of the board of treasury,\r\nwith instructions to receive from you the balance you propose to pay,\r\nfor which he will give you a receipt on the back of the order. I will\r\nconfer with you when you please on the affair of Denmark, and am,\r\nwith very great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE CREVECOEUR.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, July 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with a letter from M. Delisle, Lieutenant\r\nGeneral au bailleage de lain, to which is annexed a postscript from\r\nyourself. Being unable to write in French so as to be sure of conveying\r\nmy true meaning, or perhaps any meaning at all, I will beg of you to\r\ninterpret what I have now the honor to write.\r\n\r\nIt is time that the United States, generally, and most of the separate\r\nStates in particular, are endeavoring to establish means to pay the\r\ninterest of their public debt regularly, and to sink its principal by\r\ndegrees. But as yet, their efforts have been confined to that part of\r\ntheir debts which is evidenced by _certificate_. I do not think that\r\nany State has yet taken measures for paying their _paper money_ debt.\r\nThe principle on which it shall be paid I take to be settled, though\r\nnot directly, yet virtually, by the resolution of Congress of June 3d,\r\n1784; that is, that they will pay the holder, or his representative,\r\nwhat the money was worth at the time he received it, with an interest\r\nfrom that time of six per cent, per annum. It is not said in the letter\r\nwhether the money received by Barboutin was Continental money; nor\r\nis it said at what time it was received. But, that M. Delisle may be\r\nenabled to judge what the five thousand three hundred and ninety-eight\r\ndollars were worth in hard money when Barboutin received them, I will\r\nstate to you what was the worth of one hard dollar, both in Continental\r\nand Virginia money, through the whole of the years 1779 and 1780,\r\nwithin some part of which it was probably received:\r\n\r\n         CONTINENTAL MONEY.                  VIRGINIA MONEY.\r\n\r\n     1779--Jan.   9,   7-72/100    1779--Jan.,    8    1780-Jan.,   42\r\n            \"    24,   8-34/100          Feb.,   10         Feb.,   45\r\n           Feb.  11,   9-13/100          Mar.,   10         Mar.,   50\r\n           Mar.   2,  10                 Apr.,   16         Apr.,   60\r\n           Apr.   2,  11-12/100          May,    20         May,    60\r\n           May   10,  12-51/100          June,   20         June,   65\r\n           June  21,  14- 3/10           July,   21         July,   65\r\n           Aug.   8,  16-69/100          Aug.,   22         Aug.,   70\r\n           Sept. 28,  20                 Sept.,  26         Sept.,  72\r\n           Nov.  22,  25- 6/100          Oct.,   28         Oct.,   73\r\n     1780--Feb.   2,  33-44/100          Nov.,   36         Nov.,   74\r\n           Mar.  18,  40                 Dec.,   40         Dec.,   75\r\n\r\nThus you see that, in January 1779, seven dollars and seventy-two\r\nhundredths of a dollar of Continental money were worth one dollar of\r\nsilver, and at the same time, eight dollars of Virginia paper were\r\nworth one dollar of silver, &c. After March 18th, 1780, Continental\r\npaper, received in Virginia, will be estimated by the table of Virginia\r\npaper. I advise all the foreign holders of paper money to lodge it in\r\nthe office of their consul for the State where it was received, that\r\nhe may dispose of it for their benefit the first moment that payment\r\nshall be provided by the State or Continent. I had lately the pleasure\r\nof seeing the Countess d'Houditot well at Sanois, and have that now of\r\nassuring you of the perfect esteem and respect with which I have the\r\nhonor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, July 17, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have now the honor of enclosing to you an estimate of the\r\nexports and imports of the United States. Calculations of this kind\r\ncannot pretend to accuracy, where inattention and fraud combine to\r\nsuppress their objects. Approximation is all they can aim at. Neither\r\ncare nor candor have been wanting on my part to bring them as near the\r\ntruth as my skill and materials would enable me to do. I have availed\r\nmyself of the best documents from the custom-houses, which have been\r\ngiven to the public, and have been able to rectify these in many\r\ninstances by information collected by myself on the spot in many of the\r\nStates. Still remember, however, that I call them but approximations,\r\nand that they must present some errors as considerable as they were\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\nOur commerce divides itself into European and West Indian. I have\r\nconformed my statement to this division.\r\n\r\nOn running over the catalogue of American imports, France will\r\nnaturally mark out those articles with which she could supply us to\r\nadvantage; and she may safely calculate, that, after a little time\r\nshall have enabled us to get rid of our present incumbrances, and of\r\nsome remains of attachment to the particular forms of manufacture to\r\nwhich we have been habituated, we shall take those articles which she\r\ncan furnish, on as good terms as other nations, to whatever extent she\r\nwill enable us to pay for them. It is her interest, therefore, as well\r\nas ours, to multiply the means of payment. These must be found in the\r\ncatalogue of our exports, and among these will be seen neither gold nor\r\nsilver. We have no mines of either of these metals. Produce, therefore,\r\nis all we can offer. Some articles of our produce will be found very\r\nconvenient to this country for her own consumption. Others will be\r\nconvenient, as being more commerciable in her hands than those she\r\nwill give in exchange for them. If there be any which she can neither\r\nconsume, nor dispose of by exchange, she will not buy them of us,\r\nand of course we shall not bring them to her. If American produce can\r\nbe brought into the ports of France, the articles of exchange for it\r\nwill be taken in those ports; and the only means of drawing it hither,\r\nis to let the merchant see that he can dispose of it on better terms\r\nhere than anywhere else. If the market price of this country does not\r\nin itself offer this superiority, it may be worthy of consideration,\r\nwhether it should be obtained by such abatements of duties, and even by\r\nsuch other encouragements as the importance of the article may justify.\r\nShould some loss attend this in the beginning, it can be discontinued\r\nwhen the trade shall be well established in this channel.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the West India commerce, I must apprise you that this\r\nestimate does not present its present face. No materials have enabled\r\nus to say how it stands since the war. We can only show what it was\r\nbefore that period. This is most sensibly felt in the exports of fish\r\nand flour. The surplus of the former, which these regulations threw\r\nback on us, is forced to Europe, where, by increasing the quantity, it\r\nlessens the price; the surplus of the latter is sunk, and to what other\r\nobjects this portion of industry is turned or turning, I am not able to\r\ndiscover. The imports, too, of sugar and coffee are thrown under great\r\ndifficulties. These increase the price; and being articles of food for\r\nthe poorer class (as you may be sensible in observing the quantities\r\nconsumed), a small increase of price places them above the reach of\r\nthis class, which being very numerous, must occasion a great diminution\r\nof consumption. It remains to see whether the American will endeavor\r\nto baffle these new restrictions in order to indulge his habits, or\r\nwill adopt his habits to other objects which may furnish employment\r\nto the surplus of industry formerly occupied in raising that bread\r\nwhich no longer finds a vent in the West Indian market. If, instead\r\nof either of these measures, he should resolve to come to Europe for\r\ncoffee and sugar, he must lessen equivalently his consumption of some\r\nother European articles in order to pay for his coffee and sugar, the\r\nbread with which he formerly paid for them in the West Indies not being\r\ndemanded in the European market. In fact, the catalogue of imports\r\noffer several articles more dispensable than coffee and sugar. Of all\r\nthese subjects, the committee and yourself are the more competent\r\njudges. To you, therefore, I trust them, with every wish for their\r\nimprovement; and, with sentiments of that perfect esteem and respect\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATE OF THE EXPORTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n                               TO EUROPE.

your Excellency that we have shipped from\r\nBordeaux fifteen hundred stand of arms for the State of Virginia, of\r\nwhich I now enclose the bill of lading. A somewhat larger number of\r\ncartouch-boxes have been prepared here, are now packing, and will go to\r\nHavre immediately to be shipped there. As soon as these are forwarded,\r\nI will do myself the honor of sending you a state of the expenditures\r\nfor these and other objects. The residue of the arms and accoutrements\r\nare in a good course of preparation. I have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the highest respect, your Excellency's most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. CATHALAN.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, August 8, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been duly honored with your favor of July 28. I have in\r\nconsequence thereof reconsidered the order of Council of Berny, and\r\nit appears to me to extend as much to the southern ports of France as\r\nto the western; and that for tobacco delivered in any port where there\r\nis no manufacture, only thirty sols per quintal is to be deducted. The\r\nfarmers may perhaps evade the purchase of tobacco in a port convenient\r\nto them by purchasing the whole quantity in other ports. I shall\r\nreadily lend my aid to promote the mercantile intercourse between your\r\nport and the United States whenever I can aid it. For the present, it\r\nis much restrained by the danger of capture by the piratical States.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR HENRY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, August 9, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received the honor of your Excellency's letter of May\r\n17, 1786, on the subject of Captain Green, supposed to be in captivity\r\nwith the Algerines. I wish I could have communicated the agreeable\r\nnews that this supposition was well founded, and I should not have\r\nhesitated to gratify as well your Excellency as the worthy father of\r\nCaptain Green, by doing whatever would have been necessary for his\r\nredemption. But we have certainly no such prisoner at Algiers. We have\r\nthere twenty-one prisoners in all. Of these only four are Americans by\r\nbirth. Three of these are Captains, of the names of O'Brian, Stephens,\r\nand Coffyn. There were only two vessels taken by the Algerines, one\r\ncommanded by O'Brian, the other by Stephens. Coffyn, I believe, was a\r\nsupercargo. The Moors took one vessel from Philadelphia, which they\r\ngave up again with the crew. No other captures have been made on us\r\nby any of the piratical States. I wish I could say we were likely to\r\nbe secure against future captures. With Morocco I have hope we shall;\r\nbut the States of Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli hold their peace at a\r\nprice which would be felt by every man in his settlement with the\r\ntax-gatherer.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. _August 13, 1786._ I have this morning received information from\r\nMr. Barclay that our peace with the Emperor of Morocco would be pretty\r\ncertainly signed in a few days. This leaves us the Atlantic free.\r\nAlgiers, Tunis and Tripoli, however, remaining hostile, will shut up\r\nthe Mediterranean to us. The two latter never come into the Atlantic;\r\nthe Algerines rarely, and but a little way out of the Straits. In Mr.\r\nBarclay's letter is this paragraph, \"There is a young man now under my\r\ncare, who has been a slave sometime with the Arabs in the desert.\" His\r\nname is James Mercier, born at the town of Suffolk, Nansemond County,\r\nVirginia. The King sent him after the first audience, and I shall take\r\nhim to Spain. On Mr. Barclay's return to Spain, he shall find there a\r\nletter from me to forward this young man to his own country, for the\r\nexpenses of which I will make myself responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Since the date of my last, which was of July the 8th, I have been\r\nhonored with the receipt of yours of June the 16th. I am to thank you\r\non the part of the minister of Geneva for the intelligence it contained\r\non the subject of Gallatin, whose relations will be relieved by the\r\nreceipt of it.\r\n\r\nThe inclosed intelligence, relative to the instructions of the court\r\nof London to Sir Guy Carleton, came to me through the Count de La\r\nTouche, and Marquis de La Fayette. De La Touche is a director under the\r\nMarechal de Castries, minister for the marine department, and possibly\r\nreceives his intelligence from him, and he from their ambassador at\r\nLondon. Possibly, too, it might be fabricated here. Yet, weighing the\r\ncharacters of the ministry of St. James's and Versailles, I think the\r\nformer more capable of giving such instructions, than the latter of\r\nfabricating them for the small purposes the fabrication could answer.\r\n\r\nThe Gazette of France, of July the 28th, announces the arrival of\r\nPeyrouse at Brazil, that he was to touch at Otaheite, and proceed to\r\nCalifornia, and still further northwardly. This paper, as you well\r\nknow, gives out such facts as the court are willing the world should\r\nbe possessed of. The presumption is, therefore, that they will make an\r\nestablishment of some sort, on the north-west coast of America.\r\n\r\nI trouble you with the copy of a letter from Scheveighauser and Dobrec,\r\non a subject with which I am quite unacquainted. Their letter to\r\nCongress of November the 30th, 1780, gives their state of the matter.\r\nHow far it be true and just can probably be ascertained from Dr.\r\nFranklin, Dr. Lee, and other gentlemen now in America. I shall be glad\r\nto be honored with the commands of Congress on this subject. I have\r\ninquired into the state of their arms, mentioned in their letter to\r\nme. The principal articles were about thirty thousand bayonets, fifty\r\nthousand gunlocks, thirty cases of arms, twenty-two cases of sabres,\r\nand some other things of little consequence. The quay at Nantes, having\r\nbeen overflowed by the river Loire, the greatest part of these arms\r\nwere under water, and they are now, as I am informed, a solid mass of\r\nrust, not worth the expense of throwing them out of the warehouse, much\r\nless that of storage. Were not their want of value a sufficient reason\r\nagainst reclaiming the property of these arms, it rests with Congress\r\nto decide, whether other reasons are not opposed to this reclamation.\r\nThey were the property of a sovereign body, they were seized by an\r\nindividual, taken cognizance of by a court of justice, and refused,\r\nor at least not restored by the sovereign within whose States they had\r\nbeen arrested. These are circumstances which have been mentioned to me.\r\nDr. Franklin, however, will be able to inform Congress, with precision,\r\nas to what passed on this subject. If the information I have received\r\nbe anything like the truth, the discussion of this matter can only be\r\nwith the court of Versailles. It would be very delicate, and could have\r\nbut one of two objects; either to recover the arms, which are not worth\r\nreceiving, or to satisfy us on the point of honor. Congress will judge\r\nhow far the latter may be worth pursuing against a particular ally, and\r\nunder actual circumstances. An instance, too, of acquiescence on our\r\npart under a wrong, rather than disturb our friendship by altercations,\r\nmay have its value in some future case. However, I shall be ready to do\r\nin this what Congress shall be pleased to direct.\r\n\r\nI enclose the despatches relative to the Barbary negotiation, received\r\nsince my last. It is painful to me to overwhelm Congress and yourself\r\ncontinually with these voluminous papers. But I have no right to\r\nsuppress any part of them, and it is one of those cases where, from a\r\nwant of well-digested information, we must be contented to examine a\r\ngreat deal of rubbish, in order to find a little good matter.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of Leyden and France, to the present date, accompany this,\r\nwhich, for want of direct and safe opportunities, I am obliged to send\r\nby an American gentleman, by the way of London. The irregularity of\r\nthe French packets has diverted elsewhere the tide of passengers, who\r\nused to furnish me occasions of writing to you, without permitting my\r\nletters to go through the post office. So that when the packets go now,\r\nI can seldom write by them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[The annexed is a translation of the paper referred to in the preceding\r\nletter, on the subject of the instructions given to Sir Guy Carleton.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn extract of English political news, concerning North America. July\r\n14th, 1786.\r\n\r\nGeneral Carleton departs in a few days with M. de La Naudiere, a\r\nCanadian gentleman. He has made me acquainted with the Indian, Colonel\r\nJoseph Brandt. It is certain that he departs with the most positive\r\ninstructions to distress the Americans as much as possible, and to\r\ncreate them enemies on all sides.\r\n\r\nColonel Brandt goes loaded with presents for himself, and for several\r\nchiefs of the tribes bordering on Canada. It would be well for the\r\nAmericans to know in time, that enemies are raised against them,\r\nin order to derange their system of government, and to add to the\r\nconfusion which already exists in it. The new possessions of England\r\nwill not only gain what America shall lose, but will acquire strength\r\nin proportion to the weakening of the United States.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, the new States which are forming will place themselves\r\nunder the protection of England, which can always communicate with\r\nthem through Canada; and which, in case of future necessity, can\r\nharass the United States on one side by her shipping, and on the other\r\nby her intrigues. This system has not yet come to maturity, but it\r\nis unfolded, and we may rely upon the instructions given to Colonel\r\nBrandt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, August 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 9th of July; and, since that, have\r\nreceived yours of the 16th of June, with the interesting intelligence\r\nit contained. I was entirely in the dark as to the progress of that\r\nnegotiation, and concur entirely in the views you have taken of it.\r\nThe difficulty on which it hangs is a _sine qua non_ with us. It\r\nwould be to deceive them and ourselves, to suppose that an amity\r\ncan be preserved, while this right is withheld. Such a supposition\r\nwould argue, not only an ignorance of the people to whom this is most\r\ninteresting, but an ignorance of the nature of man, or an inattention\r\nto it. Those who see but half way into our true interest, will think\r\nthat that concurs with the views of the other party. But those who see\r\nit in all its extent, will be sensible that our true interest will be\r\nbest promoted, by making all the just claims of our fellow citizens,\r\nwherever situated, our own, by urging and enforcing them with the\r\nweight of our whole influence, and by exercising in this, as in every\r\nother instance, a just government in their concerns, and making common\r\ncause even where our separate interest would seem opposed to theirs.\r\nNo other conduct can attach us together; and on this attachment depends\r\nour happiness.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia still lives, and is even said to be better. Europe\r\nis very quiet at present. The only germ of dissension, which shows\r\nitself at present, is in the quarter of Turkey. The Emperor, the\r\nEmpress, and the Venetians seem all to be picking at the Turks. It is\r\nnot probable, however, that either of the two first will do anything to\r\nbring on an open rupture, while the King of Prussia lives.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive, by the letters I enclose to Mr. Jay, that Lambe,\r\nunder the pretext of ill health, declines returning either to\r\nCongress, Mr. Adams, or myself. This circumstance makes me fear\r\nsome malversation. The money appropriated to this object being in\r\nHolland, and, having been always under the care of Mr. Adams, it was\r\nconcerted between us that all the drafts should be on him. I know not,\r\ntherefore, what sums may have been advanced to Lambe; I hope, however,\r\nnothing great. I am persuaded that an angel sent on this business,\r\nand so much limited in his terms, could have done nothing. But should\r\nCongress propose to try the line of negotiation again, I think they\r\nwill perceive that Lambe is not a proper agent. I have written to\r\nMr. Adams on the subject of a settlement with Lambe. There is little\r\nprospect of accommodation between the Algerines, and the Portuguese\r\nand Neapolitans. A very valuable capture, too, lately made by them on\r\nthe Empress of Russia, bids fair to draw her on them. The probability\r\nis, therefore, that these three nations will be at war with them,\r\nand the probability is, that could we furnish a couple of frigates, a\r\nconvention might be formed with those powers, establishing a perpetual\r\ncruise on the coast of Algiers, which would bring them to reason. Such\r\na convention, being left open to all powers willing to come into it,\r\nshould have for its object a general peace, to be guaranteed to each,\r\nby the whole. Were only two or three to begin a confederacy of this\r\nkind, I think every power in Europe would soon fall into it, except\r\nFrance, England, and perhaps Spain and Holland. Of these, there is only\r\nEngland, who would give any real aid to the Algerines. Morocco, you\r\nperceive, will be at peace with us. Were the honor and advantage of\r\nestablishing such a confederacy out of the question, yet the necessity\r\nthat the United States should have some marine force, and the happiness\r\nof this, as the ostensible cause for beginning it, would decide on its\r\npropriety. It will be said, there is no money in the treasury. There\r\nnever will be money in the treasury, till the confederacy shows its\r\nteeth. The States must see the rod; perhaps it must be felt by some\r\none of them. I am persuaded, all of them would rejoice to see every\r\none obliged to furnish its contributions. It is not the difficulty of\r\nfurnishing them, which beggars the treasury, but the fear that others\r\nwill not furnish as much. Every rational citizen must wish to see an\r\neffective instrument of coercion, and should fear to see it on any\r\nother element than the water. A naval force can never endanger our\r\nliberties, nor occasion bloodshed; a land force would do both. It\r\nis not in the choice of the States, whether they will pay money to\r\ncover their trade against the Algerines. If they obtain a peace by\r\nnegotiation, they must pay a great sum of money for it; if they do\r\nnothing, they must pay a great sum of money, in the form of insurance;\r\nand in either way, as great a one as in the way of force, and probably\r\nless effectual.\r\n\r\nI look forward with anxiety to the approaching moment of your departure\r\nfrom Congress. Besides the interest of the confederacy and of the\r\nState, I have a personal interest in it. I know not to whom I may\r\nventure confidential communications, after you are gone. I take the\r\nliberty of placing here my respects to Mrs. Monroe, and assurances of\r\nthe sincere esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [111] [The remainder of this letter is in cypher to which\r\n     there is no key in the Editor's possession.]\r\n\r\n     [112] The original of this letter was in cypher.

The\r\n     propositions of our ministers for commercial treaties,\r\n     were received with coldness by all the European powers\r\n     except Prussia, Denmark, and Tuscany. Frederick met their\r\n     propositions cordially, and a treaty was soon concluded with\r\n     his minister at the Hague. With Denmark and Tuscany our own\r\n     ministers, from considerations of policy, protracted the\r\n     negotiations until their powers expired.--ED.\r\n\r\n     [114] Livy, Sallust, Cæsar, Cicero's epistles, Suetonius,\r\n     Tacitus, Gibbon.\r\n\r\n     [115] This was the officer who, on the evacuation of Fort\r\n     Mifflin, after the British had passed the chevaux de frise on\r\n     the Delaware, was left with fifteen men to destroy the works,\r\n     which he did, and brought off his men successfully. He had,\r\n     before that, been commander of the Rattlesnake sloop of war,\r\n     and had much annoyed the British trade. Being bred a seaman,\r\n     he has returned to that vocation.\r\n\r\n     [116] A hogshead of tobacco weighs generally about one\r\n     thousand pounds English, equal to nine hundred and seventeen\r\n     pounds French. The seven hogsheads he sailed with would\r\n     therefore weigh, according to this estimate, six thousand\r\n     four hundred and twenty-three pounds. They actually\r\n     weighed more on the first essay. When afterwards weighed\r\n     at Landivisian, they had lost eighty-four pounds on being\r\n     carried into a drier air. Perhaps, too, a difference of\r\n     weights may have entered into this apparent loss.\r\n\r\n     [117] [Minister of Foreign Affairs for France.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO VOL.
